Who To Thank For Our National Obsession With Inequalityreddit
Three years ago this week , Zuccotti Park in downtown Manhattan went from being a place bored office workers went for a cigarette break to the center of Occupy Wall Street.
Today the protesters are long gone, and the public disgust with the financial system that the movement inspired and embodied has faded. But Occupy's effects live on, in the way we talk and think about the American economy, and in the continued work of a core group of activists.
Occupy gained prominence and a following by focusing its efforts on concrete space, but its most obvious legacies are largely ambient and linguistic: Today, 45 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with their ability to get ahead by working hard . In 2008, just 31 percent felt the same way. The ubiquity of the phrase "99 percent" spiked with Occupy’s protests. And it’s hard to argue that the enduring, derogatory use of “ the 1 percent ” is not the group’s doing.
Introducing Americans to a dramatically different way to talk about inequality is a big achievement. And while much of the change over the past six years in how Americans view the rewards of work is due to the recession (hello, falling household incomes ), giving that shift a way to express itself is impressive.
Where you won’t find Occupy’s legacy is in American attitudes toward banks. Despite its initial aim, Occupy did not spark continued, mass disgust with the financial industry among the U.S. public. A Gallup poll shows that American’s now have net positive view of banks:
Occupy Wall Street may have had a short-term effect: From mid-2011 to mid-2012, Americans' already negative view of banks got marginally worse. The drop was not sustained, and its size was very minor compared to the drop caused by the global financial crisis.
How American’s feel about banks isn’t really even the best way to judge Occupy. Its goals were always both bigger (changing the dialogue about the American economy) and smaller (specific policy proposals and concentrated activism) than just getting people upset at one industry. Occupy could be the rhetoric of the 99 percent and the 1 percent (or 0.1 percent), and it could be Occupy the SEC with a scalpel-sharp 325-page, 301-footnote comment letter on the Volcker Rule.
The wonkier legacy of Occupy can be seen in things like a Senate hearing Wednesday afternoon called “Who is the economy working for? The impact of rising inequality on the American economy.” Or the determined, complex work of Strike the Debt, which just bought and canceled $3.9 million in debt from students of a for-profit college. Since 2012, it has wiped out $15 million in medical debt.
Occupy’s legacy being about something other than the banks may be for better. Popular outrage against the financial system -- as cathartic and necessary as it was -- may have outlived its use a vehicle for change. Credit to Occupy Wall Street for building more durable forms of activism at the height of its popularity. Occupy’s real but limited success shows just how hard a fight they picked.

Gun Store Names Rifle Barrel After Obama But Can t Spell His Namereddit
A California gun store is selling a rifle attachment named “Obama’s Blaster" to mock the president's support for stricter gun control laws.
In a post on its website dripping with sarcasm , Ares Armor described the nearly foot-long upper portion of an AR-15 assault rifle as a way to thank President “Barrack” Obama for being “the firearms industry spokesman and salesmen of all time.”
The jab references the surge in gun purchases that occurred after Obama and lawmakers pledged to crack down on firearm sales following the Sandy Hook gun massacre of 20 elementary school children and six adults in 2012. Nearly two years later, the gun run has only recently started to subside.
The post compares Obama to Marvin the Martian, a helmeted alien character from the Looney Tunes cartoon who is hellbent on destroying the Earth using an apocalyptic ray gun called the Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator. With Earth eliminated, Venus would be the consecutive planet to Marvin's home, Mars.
“Much like Marvin, Barry is believed to be an alien and also was in position of an Illudium Q-36 explosive space modulator,” Ares Armor wrote, referencing Looney Tunes as well as the “birther” conspiracy theory that the president is a Kenyan immigrant. “Unfortunately for us, Barry believes that the United States is not only blocking his view of Venus, but is also blocking his social and political views with our pesky Constitution.”
A minute-long video displays the features of “Obama’s Blaster.”
Ares CEO Dimitrios Karras told The Huffington Post that he was "the jerk who came up with it all." He began selling the item last month to drum up some attention for the store and tease friends who support the president's stance on gun control. Karras, 29, said the store has been flooded with threatening phone calls and messages.
A woman who called Ares Armor said she was reporting the business to the Secret Service.
"Apparently I'm a crazy redneck that's out in the middle of nowhere and I'm off my rocker and I never would have done this to insult President Bush," said Karras, noting that he voted for Obama in the 2012 election. "It's a joke, it's funny. People need to take it down a notch and take themselves a little less seriously -- not everyone out there is a crazy white racist."
So far, he said, the store has sold hundreds of Obama's Blasters, now discounted to $550 from $690.
The blurb on the barrel’s product page continues with its puzzling Looney Tunes analogy, suggesting that Obama's Blaster could have prevented Bugs Bunny when he stopped Marvin from destroying the Earth.
“Luckily, after 2,000 years of research and when he was finally ready to use the Illudium Q-36 explosive space modulator to destroy the Constitution and the United States, Bugs Bunny saved the day and destroyed this device,” reads the post. “If good ol’ Barry had been in possession of a ‘blaster’ such as this, maybe things would have been different for Bugsy.”
For good measure, the gun tacked on a parenthetical postscript to remind readers that “Barrack” -- yes, the store twice misspelled the president’s first name -- doesn’t actually endorse the product.
Karras, who served as a Marine in Afghanistan and Iraq, told HuffPost that he intentionally misspelled the name to be "semi-disrespectful."
"A lot of this stuff is literally meant to rile up my friends on the left side of the fence," Karras said.
The White House did not immediately return a call requesting comment Thursday morning.
This isn't the first time the gun industry has taken aim at Obama. Last year, California-based Zombie Industries was forced to pull a zombie target mannequin made to look like Obama from its booth at the National Rifle Association's convention in Houston. A paper target resembling the president, however, remains on sale for $50 per 100-pack.

Alibaba founder Jack Ma s success taleAlibaba mega IPO caps founder Jack Ma success tale
By KELVIN CHAN | Associated Press –  Fri 19 Sep, 2014
View Photo
FILE -In this Sept. 15, 2014 file photo, Alibaba Group founder and Executive Chairman …
HONG KONG (AP) — When Jack Ma founded Alibaba 15 years ago he insisted the e-commerce venture should see itself as competing against Silicon Valley, not other Chinese companies. That bold ambition from a time when China was still a corporate backwater has been vindicated this week by Alibaba completing a mammoth sale of shares to investors in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Charismatic by the gray standards of Chinese CEOs, the elfin Ma is nicknamed "Crazy Jack" and is seen as China's version of Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates. Ma used his entrepreneurial wits to build up an e-commerce giant in stark contrast to the state owned companies that became behemoths because of Communist Party policies and ties to the political elite.
The initial public offering, which will raise as much as $25 billion, cements his position as one of China's richest people. Ma will reap $867 million by selling 12.75 million shares and will still retain a nearly 8 percent stake worth $13.1 billion based on the $68 a share price that Alibaba announced Thursday. The shares start trading in New York on Friday.
A former English teacher who flunked his college entrance exam twice, Ma founded Alibaba in his apartment in 1999 with 17 friends. He wasn't shy about his global ambitions, telling them in an early meeting that year that "our competitors are not in China but in America's Silicon Valley," according to a scene in the recent documentary "Crocodile in the Yangtze." He said that when it comes to software and information, "Chinese brains are just as good as" American brains.
Ma settled on the company's name because it could be easily pronounced in almost any language. The company started as a site to link Chinese manufacturers with buyers overseas and is now an e-commerce behemoth that's expanded into banking, digital maps and online video.
Ma, 50, stepped down as CEO last year to focus on philanthropy but remains chairman and an important figurehead for the company's 21,000 employees.
An enthralling speaker, Ma also enjoys performing at annual company meetings called Alifests. To mark the company's 10th anniversary in 2009, some 16,000 staff gathered in a stadium were treated to a performance by Ma dressed as a punk rocker.
As a boy, he improved his English by volunteering as a tour guide in his hometown of Hangzhou, a picturesque city near Shanghai. He earned an English degree after passing the college exam on the third try. He taught at a local college, then set up his own translation company but moonlighted as a street peddler, hawking flowers, books, flashlights and clothes, to balance the books.
Ma's path to internet retailing dominance began with a business trip to the United States in 1995 that went sour after the investor he was to meet turned out to be con man. Before he returned, he met contacts in Seattle who introduced him to the World Wide Web. His search for beer turned up nothing from China, leaving him with the kernel of an idea for a website devoted to things Chinese.
Ma partnered with a state-owned enterprise to start a Chinese version of the Yellow Pages that was Alibaba's precursor. The venture ended with a falling out and he later founded Alibaba in Hangzhou.
The company launched retail website Taobao in 2003 to compete with eBay in China. Ma was unfazed about going up against the U.S. giant, famously saying, "Ebay is a shark in the ocean. We are a crocodile in the Yangtze River. If we fight in the ocean, we will lose. But if we fight in the river, we will win."
Ebay shuttered its China site in 2006, a major victory for Ma.

Fuel added to fire on issue of chimney inspection cost0
A: If the association is required to maintain, repair and replace the chimneys as a common expense in the declaration or bylaws, the cost for a chimney inspection would be a common expense unless there is a provision in the declaration or bylaws allowing the board to assess user charges for services that are not used equally by all unit owners.
If such a provision exists, the board may assess an annual chimney inspection cost to owners of homes with chimneys.
Q: I live in a condominium association, and the board adopted a rule and regulation requiring automobile owners to purchase a $50 sticker to identify cars parked in the parking lot. Not all unit owners own cars, thus, less than all the unit owners are required to pay the sticker fee. Can only car owners in an association be forced to pay this charge?
A: Pursuant to Section 18.4 of the Condominium Act, the board administers the common elements. Section 18.4(h) allows the board to adopt rules and regulations governing the details of the operation and use of the property.
Automobile identification stickers are common rules for the boards to monitor authorized cars in an association parking lot. So yes, the board may adopt registration fees for car stickers, and only those unit owners that have cars are required to pay.
Q: My mother lived in a condominium association but had to move out of her unit because she can no longer live on her own.
I have a power of attorney for property and want to lease the unit for income, but the association declaration and bylaws prohibit leases to anyone other than immediate family members. Is such a leasing restriction valid?
A: Leasing restrictions contained in condominium declarations are valid unless they violate a constitutional right or applicable law. This concept has been upheld by courts in Illinois and elsewhere.
There are myriad common leasing restrictions. On one end is a complete prohibition from leasing altogether, and on the other end are provisions allowing leasing, but with restrictions such as leasing to only family members, lease term limits, residency requirement before being eligible to lease and/or percentage caps on the number of units that may be leased, to name a few.

Maharashtra Assembly elections: Uddhav meets Sena leaders to finalise candidates listThe leader said that there has been no word from the BJP over Sena's "final" proposal of keeping 151 seats for itself and offer of 119 seats to BJP and rest to smaller allies.
PTI | Mumbai | Posted: September 21, 2014 8:43 pm
‘Matoshree’, the residence of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in suburban Bandra, saw a flurry of activity throughout the day with the party leadership meeting district unit chiefs and local leaders to finalise the list of candidates for October 15 Assembly elections.
According to a Sena leader, the meetings were attended by party MPs and senior leaders.
Though the leader termed the development as “routine meetings to finalise candidates”, they came against the backdrop of tough posturing by both the Sena and BJP over finalisation of seats to contest the polls.
The alliance between Sena and BJP is teetering on the brink over disagreement on sharing of seats.
The leader said that there has been no word from the BJP over Sena’s “final” proposal of keeping 151 seats for itself and offer of 119 seats to BJP and rest to smaller allies who are constituents of ‘Mahayuti’ (grand alliance).
Maharashtra Assembly has 288 seats.
Shiv Sena had contested 169 seats and BJP 119 in 2009 Assembly elections.
Meanwhile, representatives of Rashtriya Samaj Party and Swabhimani Shektari Sanghtana – both constituents of ‘Mahayuti’ – met Uddhav to discuss the fate of the alliance amid growing anxiety in political circles over continuation of the saffron coalition.
Sadabhau Khot of Swabhimani Shetkari Sangthana told PTI after meeting the Sena chief that efforts are on to save the alliance. “We will meet BJP leaders tomorrow to find a solution,” he added.
Time is running out for the saffron alliance of 25 years in the run-up to elections which are less than a month away, with September 27 being the last date for filing of nominations.
Against the backdrop of haggling over sealing the deal on seat-sharing, Shiv Sena today offered a take-it-or-leave-it formula of 119 seats which BJP has termed as being “nothing new”.

Seat sharing row: Sena puts ahead the 151-119-18 formula  BJP rejects itComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party in Maharashtra on Monday rejected ally Shiv Sena's 'final' offer of 119 seats, thus worsening the crisis in the saffron alliance.
BJP president Amit Shah called up Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and urged him not to break the 25-year old alliance, TV reports said. Shah also requested the Sena to rethink on seat sharing for the 288-member assembly polls.
This comes amid indications that the BJP  is readying a Plan B with state leaders telling Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they would rather go it alone than accept this.
Modi is now expected to attempt a reconciliation. In New Delhi, the BJP’s top brass took stock of the seat sharing talks, but kept its cards close to its chest.
After a meeting of its parliamentary board, Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah had a separate 10-minute-long meeting. The party remain tight-lipped about it.
The Sena has given the BJP a breather saying it would wait till Monday. The last date for filing nominations is September 27.
“Modi may not immediately sanction an extreme step and could try and convince the Sena chief,” said a BJP leader close to the developments.
For over a fortnight, the saffron combine has been squabbling over the formula for sharing the 288 assembly seats going to polls on October 15.
Earlier in the day, Thackeray speaking at his party’s national executive meeting in Mumbai, told a cheering crowd of Sainiks to prepare to go solo if the talks did not fructify.
In what his partymen saw as his best-ever public speech, Thackeray said his formula  -- of 151 seats for the Sena, 119 for the BJP and 18 for smaller allies --  was his last-ditch effort to save the alliance.
HT Analysis: Uddhav wary of BJP’s Maha ambitions
The BJP responded within the hour. “We fought 119 seats in 2009, even now they are offering us 119. How is this justified,” asked senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse. Talking in New Delhi, he said the two parties should reshuffle the 59 seats the Sena has not won in the past three elections and 19 the BJP had not won and then arrive at a figure.
“Also, these talks cannot take place through television. We need to sit face-to-face,” Khadse added, saying the BJP was still open to talks, putting the ball back into the Sena’s court. BJP insiders said the party had readied a list of 130 candidates and was waiting for word from the top leaders to release it.
In his speech, Thackeray criticised the present batch of BJP leaders reminding them of how the alliance, formed by LK Advani, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and Pramod Mahajan with the late Bal Thackeray, came together not for power but for Hindutva.
“We had differences of opinion with Mahajan and [Gopinath] Munde too. But our relationship never got strained like it has happened now. We both knew how much to stretch,” he said. He reminded Modi that the Shiv Sena stood by him during the riots in Gujarat.
He also warned the BJP against creating hurdles when a golden opportunity to win the state elections has arisen, just as they kept to the alliance dharma during the Lok Sabha polls.
The Sena chief did not hide his chief ministerial ambitions either. “If you are looking down on the Shiv Sena, then our sainiks are ready to fight back. Get ready to face consequences…. I promise to capture power in Maharashtra at any cost,” Thackeray said.
The state BJP  is bent on teaching the Sena a lesson, but the party’s central leadership thinks a break-up could mar the BJP’s credibility among other allies.
“Any decision needs to be taken with some solid foresight. No doubt that the Sena has us in a catch-22 position, but then we need to find a solution that will go a long away,” said a BJP leader.
While a decision to split has not yet been finalised, the break-up of this long-time friendship is sure to change the political map of Maharashtra for years to come.

India  China border stand-off continues in LadakhEYE BROWSE
Chinese troops remain on Indian territory in Ladakh
The standoff began earlier this week when nomads pitched tents on a common grazing ground in Charding-Ninglung Nullah, also known as CNN track junction.
Mail Today –  Sat 20 Sep, 2014
Print
NEW DELHI: Chinese President Xi Jinping left New Delhi on Friday, but his three-day high-profile visit to India had no impact on ground zero in southeastern Ladakh, where Indian and Chinese troops continued to hold their positions amid a border stand-off that has lasted 10 days and counting.
There were no signs of disengagement on the frontier, except that the distance between Indian Army and People's Liberation Army (PLA) personnel increased on Friday. Officials maintained, however, that the two sides were holding their tactical positions.
'In control'
Sources said the Army has ensured that the Chinese do not construct a road right up to the border in Chumar, one of two sites along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh where the ongoing faceoff is centred.
While India has objected to the construction of the road, China wants the removal of an Indian post named 30R. Indian officials said there is no question of moving from the current location even though the Chinese consider the boundary to be beyond this point.
Sources said the Army is in full control of the situation in Chumar as "it has a substantial number of troops in place for the long haul". India is digging in its heels and is not inclined to ask for another flag meeting to defuse the situation.
Things also remained unchanged in Demchok, east of Chumar, where Chinese civilians had challenged Indians to reinforce territorial claims.
The standoff began earlier this week when nomads pitched tents on a common grazing ground in Charding-Ninglung Nullah, also known as CNN track junction.
The CNN is largely considered the effective boundary and both Indian and Chinese civilians have laid claim to the ground.
Apart from this, the Chinese have also protested against the construction of an irrigation canal by India in the area.
As local commanders awaited political directions on the future course of action, Army chief General Dalbir Singh briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the situation.
The assessment in New Delhi is that the Chinese have got into a peculiar situation as their troops are positioned in freezing temperatures in an unprepared area and without a roof.
Their supply lines are some distance from the area of the standoff.
In contrast, the Indian side is holding on to established positions. New Delhi has conveyed to the Chinese leadership that the troops should return to the pre-September 10 positions, with an implicit understanding that maintaining the status quo is not considered withdrawal.
India has also maintained that it has historically held areas in Chumar. As has been the practice, troops are not position in disputed areas. The disputed stretches are only patrolled. Restoring the pre-September 10 position essentially means that disputed areas should be vacated.

Combining candour with warmthUpdated: September 20, 2014 08:41 IST
Combining candour with warmth
India-China
The visit of President Xi Jinping was remarkable for many things but mostly for the shift in the way India has done diplomacy with China. Overshadowing President Xi’s visit was an incident on the Line of Actual control in the Chumar region of Ladakh, where troops and civilians were in a stand-off over construction activity on the Indian side. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement to the media, in the presence of the Chinese President, publicly driving home New Delhi’s concerns about the “repeated incidents” at the border was addressed perhaps as much to Bharatiya Janata Party constituencies who want to see a hard line pressed on China, as it was to Beijing. The previous UPA government had preferred to send out quieter messages on the border question. This, combined with Mr. Modi upending protocol and conventions to accord Mr. Xi a more than effusive welcome in Ahmedabad, succeeded in giving new optics to New Delhi’s China policy. The new signalling seems to have elicited a quick response, with the Chinese side saying that the two leaders had committed themselves to resolving the border issue “as soon as possible”, and that they had reached a “consensus” on the way forward. In a joint statement, the two sides acknowledged that “peace and tranquility on the India-China border areas was [ … ] an important guarantor for the development and continued growth of bilateral relations,” and that “pending a final resolution of the boundary question, the two sides would continue to make joint efforts to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.”
Despite Prime Minister Modi’s keenness to demonstrate the difference in his approach, beneath the new veneer there was enough continuity with the past too, in the way the government was careful to keep the strategic aspects of the ties separate from the economic and trade issues. In 2013, the BJP, then in the opposition, had taken on the UPA for its perceived inability to face up to China during a stand-off between troops in Ladakh, even asking what use trade relations were when the government could not stand up for the country’s territory. Now in power, the BJP knows that the two issues are best compartmentalised — the incident in Ladakh during President Xi’s visit did not prevent India from welcoming Chinese investments, though at $20 billion the pledges were lower than expected. China has also agreed to address the imbalance in bilateral trade. The overall positive atmospherics of the visit despite the overhang of the Ladakh stand-off also carry an important message to the world, ahead of Mr. Modi’s visit later this month to the United States, that India and China are entirely capable of managing their relations despite their differences.
Corrections and Clarifications:

Diplomatic talks aside  China still bypasses Indian exportsAlso read: India-China talks: High on hype; low on substance?
In an interview to CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh, Dr Sachin Chaturvedi, Director General, RIS says China continues to bypass India. He says China is using non tariff barriers to block Indian export of agriculture products.
He says Indian pharma exports too are not being allowed and despite USFDA’s clearances to the drugs, China on pretext of standards, is not allowing exports in Beijing or Shanghai.
Also read: Key trade, biz announcements during China Xi's India visit
Professor SK Mohanty says the issue also lies with the value chain. While India has competitive advantage in several lines of products like machinery, precision instruments, chemicals, in some sort of textiles, China continues to import from Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar (Burma) and Vietnam.
In the process of import from ASEAN countries, China is completely bypassing India’s capabilities. “China should change its strategy to source more from India where it is more competitive than other countries so that it can benefit itself by lowering its cost of imports from other ASEAN countries and also provide greater market access to India, he adds.
Below is the transcript of Sachin Chaturvedi & SK Mohanty’s interview with Latha Venkatesh on CNBC-TV18.
Q: We understand that China is now moving from slightly lower value-added industries to more hi-tech industries. It is vacating some industries. Do you think this vacating can be an area which India can take over and thereby bridge the trade deficit? What are the immediate plans that you can think of to bridge this vast trade deficit?
Chaturvedi: It is very important for us to realise that almost 42 percent of our total exports to China is coming from our natural base. So that kind of extractive profile that China has exhibited in the last couple of years from across the world is a major challenge and that India would have to evolve proactive measures in terms of promoting technology intensive exports and that requires a major push.
Q: If you can elaborate a bit more since most of us are very ignorant of what exactly are the products exported. You are saying it’s largely items like iron ore which are natural resources.
Chaturvedi: Exactly. If one looks at the statistics, one will find that textile is almost 26 percent of our total exports while minerals and base metals are almost 42 percent of the total exports. So China’s appetite for natural products for minerals, for iron ore and other things is huge and unfortunately, India hasn’t put any kind of check on this export (a) because it is very rewarding and (b) because traders are finding it very easy to ship it to China. Sometimes we know from one of these states even unauthorised exports of iron ore have happened in the past.
Q: Would you say that the export levy on iron ore which India introduced a year ago is the way to go. As well what other strategies can India employ?
Chaturvedi: That is only one dimension of the challenge that we have to face. The second one is far more intense in terms of domestic policy proposition which is to give impetus to our manufacturing sector. As you rightly mentioned in the beginning about giving push to our technology intensive exports and there is a sort of vacuum in our export portfolio at this stage. So, it has to be addressed. We need to put our thinking hats on in terms of how we create a niche for that and as one might have noticed Dr. Mohanty has come up with a study which lays out nuances of a strategy in which we make India part of the global value chains which are bringing in India and China together. So, that is the way forward and we would have to lay out a roadmap in terms of how we can hookup at least some sectors of our manufacturing area to have a balance in terms of a hook to linkup with when it comes to high technology exports.
Q: In your paper you speak of the global value chain as well as the regional value chain. How does India fit in?
Mohanty: One can see that the global trade is moving fast in the areas of regional valuation and in this regard if one looks at the competitive position of India vis-à-vis other suppliers of products related to valuation sector, then India is better-off compared to many countries in south and south east Asian region.
The study has highlighted that in the sector, value chain particularly parts and components, India has got competitiveness in several lines of products like machinery, precision instruments, chemicals, in some sort of textiles – these are the broad sectors within the region of value chain particularly parts and components where India has got competitiveness as compared to major leading countries in south east Asian counties like Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.
Q: What is holding back? Is it that we are not part of an Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) or any of the regional trading blocks? Is that the reason why we are not participating in this regional value chain?
Mohanty: Difficulty is that China is consistently through bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and regional FTAs with ASEAN, sourcing much from the ASEAN region and has completely bypassed India’s capabilities. China should change its strategy to source more from India where it is more competitive than other countries so that it can benefit itself by lowering its cost of imports from other ASEAN countries and also provide greater market access to India.
Q: You were telling me that India is trying to get China to accept ASEAN+6. At the moment China has preferred the group ASEAN+3 and India is not in that plus three, so they should get into ASEAN+6. Is China resisting it stubbornly or is it something which India can win over?
Chaturvedi: China’s resistance for India’s access to not only their own market but even to that of ASEAN is very much evident. We need to realise the agony that our pharmaceutical market is facing in terms of market access in China. So, that struggle is going on.
The issue here is that there is growth in India as they are saying; the only challenge that we have at the domestic level is to have consistency in terms of our production, production of quality and then be part of those value chains which are coming in. So, some proactive measures we require on part of our own industry and our government to see that we are part of those chains. As you know in the last couple of years and if you see the number you were right that China has invested very little right from 2000 to 2014, only something like USD 400 million but if you look at India’s investment in China, it is somewhere close to USD 1 billion from 2000 to 2012. So, that very much shows that there is eagerness among Indian investor and Indian exporters to link up with Chinese market and take the measures that are important in terms of tap on these externalities which are evident from the Chinese.
Q: I agree but is there a resistance on the past of China, is China using this bypassing of India because of diplomatic reason. Is China deliberately keeping India out?
Chaturvedi: Yes, definitely because the way China is using non tariff barriers to block our export of agriculture products. If you speak to export promotion council, they would tell you how much resistance we are facing in export of agricultural products on names of sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade. So, sanitary/phyto-sanitary (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBT) are the two agreements of WTO within which China is blocking our export of agricultural products.
You would also find resistance in terms of not allowing export of our pharmaceutical products to China. However, for the last five years, major India companies are requesting for clearance even when they have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance to export to Untied States - China on questions or on pretext of standard, is not allowing our pharmaceutical exporters to land up in Beijing or Shanghai. So those are some of the measures and I was expecting that during this visit of the premier, the issue of mutual recognition of standards would come up and this is the way we have addressed our problems with USA, which was a sort of economy ridden with barriers.
Q: But it hasn’t come up?
Chaturvedi: No, it hasn’t come up at this point but I was hoping that something would be done to address this.
Q: Do you think that we need to get into the ASEAN first and then when your products are there, getting into China is easy?
Mohanty: At the outset I would like to tell that at the beginning there are two processes – ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+6 and China was insisting on ASEAN+3 because China was more consistent with countries like Japan, Korea and China. Therefore, China wanted that ASEAN+3 should start first but subsequently India and other countries strongly argued and several studies showed that there is tremendous potential in ASEAN+6, which is much better than ASEAN+3 and that is how the new grouping has come up in the name of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and India is part of RCEP and now there is no ASEAN+3.
As you rightly said that several ideas have come up and we have seen in various studies that many of them are found to be very good particularly ASEAN could be India’s future.
Q: Two issues – the renminbi has remain stable compared to the dollar and definitely compared to the rupee as well over the past four-five years since the Lehman crises and India has had the advantage of huge depreciation in the last one year. Is this going to be able to bridge the deficit?
Chaturvedi: I think much more substantive issue in context of India-China relationship is this huge trade deficit to which you alluded in the beginning and that trade deficit we would have to address. However, if you pick up details on China’s strategy because China is facing hit all across the world because of trade deficit. Latin American countries immediate after Fortaleza meeting of BRIC when premier went across Latin America, every country they raised this issue of trade deficit with China.
So, there the issue that China is trying to raise is to take that advantage of trade deficit to turn it into preferential investment arrangement and after coming back from Ahmedabad the premier again indicated in terms of preferential investment access in India. Therefore, the USD 20 billion proposal that has come up for investment is a very little given the huge gap we have of USD 36 billion. So that’s a major challenge that we are facing and you rightly said in the beginning that with Japan we have a deficit of only USD 6 billion. With China the measures to allow market access is an issue as I said in the beginning but then to turn deficit into preferential investment to get absorbed at the local level is a strategy which is a very brilliant masterstroke from China and we would have to understand this game and would have to take it in that earnestness.

Sebi bars 13 entities for large-scale GDR manipulationSebi bars 13 entities for large-scale GDR manipulation
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Sep 21, 2014 11:00 AM IST
Regulator Sebi has barred as many as 13 entities from securities market for five years in a matter relating to manipulation of global depository receipts (GDRs) issued by some Indian companies.
In a strongly-worded order, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said that the illegal activities undertaken by these 13 entities can "jeopardise and tarnish the image of the securities market as a transparent and efficient way of raising capital, shaking the very foundation of capital market in India."
A detailed probe by Sebi found that these entities actively traded in the shares of GDR-issuer companies and thereby facilitated the sub accounts of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in selling those shares in Indian markets.
In a 48-page order, Sebi has consequently barred Basmati Securities, Oudh Finance and Investment, Alka India, SV Enterprise/Sarfaraz Khan Pathan, Ashok Panchariya, Madanlal Girdharilal Bugualiya and Indra Varun Trade Impex from the capital markets for five years.
Others facing the prohibition include Delight Financial Advisors, Vinod Amrutlaal Naai, Newgen International, Excel Paints, Cherry Cosmetics and Edelweiss Estate.
Taking a lenient view in Gujarat Enterprise case, Sebi however said the company did not trade in the shares of GDR issuer firms but it is alleged to have acted as layer between the 13 entities for transfer of funds.
Although, Sebi warned Gujarat Enterprise to "ensure that all its future dealings in the securities markets may be done strictly in accordance with law."
Regulator also said that SV Enterprise, Oudh Finance and Investment, Basmati Securities and Alka India have already undergone a debarment of three years.
The prohibition already gone by these firms following a Sebi's interim order in September 2011 "shall be reduced while computing the period of debarment being imposed vide this order."
The Sebi probe revealed that GDR issue was devised by Pancharia in connivance with the issuer firms -- Asahi Infrastructure & Projects, K Sera Sera, IKF Technologies, Avon Corp, CAT Technologies and Maars Software International -- through a fraudulent manner. All of them made at least one GDR issue during 2007-09.
The securities were subsequently offloaded to Indian investors through various entities connected to Panchariya. The 13 entities were connected to Panchariya and collectively referred as CP Group.
Sebi, through its interim order in September 2011, banned these issuer companies from issuing equity shares or any other instrument convertible into equities.
"I am of the considered view that trades in the scrip of the issuer companies were carried out by the CP group alongwith sub accounts in an irregular and manipulative nature," Sebi Whole Time Member S Raman said in its final order dated September 19 this year.

Gujarat: VHP seeks Muslim clerics arrest for comments onNavratriPrint
PTI | Ahmedabad | Posted: September 21, 2014 10:04 pm
Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Sunday took strong objection to what it termed as “provocative” remarks on Navratri festival by Maulana Mehdi Hasan, saying it is a deliberate attempt to “malign” Hinduism and demanded his arrest.
VHP has also called for a statewide movement in Gujarat to bar Muslim youths from entering venues for ‘garba’, a traditional dance performed during the festival in praise of goddess Durga, to prevent incidents of “eve teasing”.
Hasan, a resident of Rustampura in Thasra taluka of Kheda district, had shot into limelight when he tried to put a skull cap on then chief minister Narandra Modi’s head during the latter’s Sadbhavna fast in 2011.
VHP is angry over an interview given by Hasan to a local Gujarati newspaper in which he is quoted as saying that Navratri is the “festival of devils as rapists and drunkards use to participate in it”. The interview was published yesterday.
Addressing reporters here, the general secretary of VHP’s city unit Ranchhod Bharwad said that Hasan’s remarks are a deliberate attempt to malign Hinduism.
“When just a few days are left for Navratri to begin, the Maulana said that it is not a religious festival and further added that it is a festival of Rakshash (devils). This is a conspiracy to defame Hindus. This is an attempt to disturb harmony and peace in Gujarat,” Bharwad told reporters at a press conference here today.
When contacted, Hasan told PTI that his remarks were taken out of context and rather he wants Hindus to “keep such elements away from the festival to keep its sanctity”.
Bharwad also threatened to launch a statewide agitation if Hasan is not arrested by police.
When asked if VHP or any other organisation has filed any FIR in this regard, Bharwad said that police have taken their application.
He was referring to an application given to Dariyapur police station in the city by a local Shiv Sena leader Jitu Solanki today.
Solanki has reportedly asked police to arrest Hasan for allegedly creating enmity between two communities by making such remarks about Hindu gods and festivals.
When contacted, inspector V N Yadav of Dariyapur police station told PTI that police are looking into the matter, but refused to elaborate.
Meanwhile, Hasan told PTI that his comments were taken out of context.
“I said those words with a particular reference. Devils means those who are drunkards and rapists, not everyone who enjoys that festival. I am a Sufi who believes in bringing peace among communities. I actually drew attention of Hindus to keep such elements away from such religious festivals to restore the sanctity. But my views were taken otherwise,” he said over phone.
Bharwad further said that VHP was not going to tolerate such derogatory remarks on Hindu festivals.
“We have asked government to arrest him (Hasan) before Navratri, or else, VHP and Bajrang Dal will gherao him at his residence,” said Bharwad, flanked by Akhileshwardas Maharaj, a member of VHP’s Central Advisory Committee, at the presser.
Akhileshwardas said that VHP will take the matter into its hands and “teach Maulana a lesson if police failed to act swiftly”.

Uddhav refuses to yield  both sides wait for other toblinkPrint

Written by Shubhangi Khapre , Liz Mathew | New Delhi/mumbai | Posted: September 21, 2014 9:29 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 8:29 am
The 25-year-old alliance between the BJP and Shiv Sena was on the brink of a break-up on Sunday with the BJP rejecting the seat-sharing formula proposed by Uddhav Thackeray . On Sunday morning, the Sena publicly offered 119 seats to the BJP , keeping 151 seats for itself and 18 for their smaller allies.
Top leaders of the BJP held marathon discussions in New Delhi to chalk out strategy . A parliamentary board meeting was followed by the Central Election Committee holding talks, which was followed by another meeting of the parliamentary board. Both party chief Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended all the meetings.
According to highly placed sources, Shah and Modi also met separately where they discussed the ramifications “if the Sena and BJP separate” and what can be done to “salvage” the tie-up.
The BJP has reportedly indicated to the Sena that the alliance would end if its demand for 126 to130 seats was not met. It has proposed 140-144 seats for the Sena and 18 for the allies. Both the central and state BJP were agreed that the Sena’s offer of 119 was not acceptable at any cost.
The Sena, that also held meetings throughout the day, has decided to wait till Monday before making any move. The Maharashtra BJP core committee conveyed to the central leaders that it was ready to contest all the 288 seats in the state in the October 15 elections. While the overall mood in the party is that it should not buckle under the Sena’s pressure, senior leaders are willing to make one last attempt to bring around its ally. Senior leaders and Union ministers Sushma Swaraj and Rajnath Singh may be deployed to hold negotiations with Uddhav.
While some BJP sources said the bone of contention was not seat-sharing but the Sena’s insistence on announcing Uddhav as the coalition’s chief ministerial candidate, the BJP officially denied it. In a clear signal to its ally, the BJP parliamentary board meeting reviewed its preparations on the 169 seats which were contested by the Sena in the 2009 elections. The BJP had contested 119 seats then.
Similarly, at his meetings at Matoshree with Sena leaders, Uddhav worked on a ‘Plan A’ and ‘Plan B’. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana leader Raju Shetty and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksha’s Mahadev Jankar also held meetings with him to save the alliance.
Uddhav raised the 169:119 formula of 2009 to make the argument for his seat-sharing offer Sunday. Under it, nine seats each were to be left by the Sena and BJP for allies Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana, Republican Party of India, Rashtriya Samaj Paksha and Shiv Sangram. “It would mean the Sena getting 160 seats, BJP 110 and allies 18. But continued…

NCP core panel meet tomorrow to decide on seat sharing deadlock withCongressPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 21, 2014 9:01 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 8:45 am
Putting pressure on Congress over the deadlock regarding seat sharing for the Maharashtra Assembly polls, NCP on Sunday said a meeting of its core committee in Mumbai tomorrow will take a final call on the matter even as it asserted that it is sticking to its “original demand”.
“No new proposal has been received by the party. We stand by our original demand for 144 Assembly seats. Time is of the essence as the election process has already begun,” senior NCP leader Praful Patel said.
Patel said that the meeting of the NCP Core Committee, which is to be held at around noon tomorrow, would take a “final call” on the stalemate.
His statement came even as Congress looked for ways to end the impasse with leaders from Maharashtra, including Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and PCC chief Manikrao Thakre, holding consultations with some central leaders.
There was no word from Congress on the way ahead and a section of Maharashtra leaders have been alleging that Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar was the stumbling block in efforts to find a solution.
Patel, the NCP Vice President, had on Saturday given Congress a day to respond on the issue of seat sharing for the Oct. 15 Assembly polls in Maharashtra saying that his party could wait no longer.
“The filing of nominations has begun. We can wait for a day more for Congress’s response on our proposal on the quantum of seats,” Patel had said, though he had clarified that it was not meant to be an ultimatum.
In New Delhi, Maharashtra Congress chief Manikrao Thakre had on Saturday said they have put the ball in NCP’s court and claimed that the Sharad Pawar-led party is yet to give a “positive response” to the former’s proposal for seat sharing.
After a meeting of the party’s Central Election Committee (CEC) here on Saturday, he had said that Congress will have to prepare for all 288 seats in the state if a response from NCP does not come within a day or two.
The CEC had held deliberations on the selection of candidates for the 174 seats in Maharashtra which the party had contested in the last Assembly polls.

Chinese pitch seven tents in Chumar; stand offcontinuesPrint
Press Trust of India | Leh/new Delhi | Posted: September 21, 2014 8:50 pm | Updated: September 21, 2014 9:10 pm
The stand-off in Chumar area of Ladakh area took a new turn on Sunday with Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) pitching seven tents well within the Indian territory and showing no signs of withdrawing from the territory.
The Chinese who had arrived in vehicles on Saturday in Chumar, 300 km from Leh, started erecting the tents in the Indian territory despite repeated warnings by the army to vacate the area, official sources said.
ALSO READ:  Repeated incursions by China won’t be overlooked: Rajnath
Nearly 100 personnel of the PLA strength were estimated around Point 30R, a strategically important post, as it helps India to keep a vigil deep inside the occupied territory of Chinese, they said.
This incursion was in addition to the 35-odd personnel who were already camping at a hillock in the Chumar area itself, the sources said.
The Chinese soldiers were demanding that Indian army should withdraw simultaneously from the area but the army had decided to dig in its heels. The Chinese soldiers had retreated to their territory on Thursday night.
The Point 30R post has been frequented by PLA often as Indian Army has kept an observation post which dominates the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and gives advantage to India in keeping a vigil on the Chinese activity deep across the border.
Chinese helicopters were again seen in action for dropping food packets for its soldiers but none of them violated the air space. The food packets were later collected by the PLA personnel and stored inside the tents.
The tension in this area erupted on Sunday when some of the Chinese workers, who were constructing road on their side, started entering into the Indian side and also claimed that they had orders to build road upto Tible, five km deep into the Indian territory, the sources said.
The Indian army asked the Chinese workers to leave, telling them that otherwise they would face prosecution under Indian laws for entering the country illegally.
Chumar, the last village in Ladakh area bordering Himachal Pradesh, has been a bone of contention with China claiming it to be its own territory.
In 2012, the PLA dropped some of its soldiers in this region and dismantled the makeshift storage tents of the Army and ITBP.
Chumar had become a flash point during the fortnight long stand-off last year in Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) last year as the Chinese side had objected to overhead bunkers erected by the Indian side.
As part of an agreement reached at the flag meeting to end the stand-off from April-May 2013 at DBO, the Indian side had to dismantle some overhead bunkers in Chumar.
Again, Chumar witnessed Chinese troops walking away with an Army surveillance camera on June 17 which was meant for keeping an eye on the PLA troops patrolling there. The same camera was returned after a few days.
During winter this year, Chinese soldiers attempted to enter this area riding on horses. The area has witnessed frequent incursion attempts by the Chinese troops.
Chinese helicopters were again seen in action for dropping food packets for its soldiers but none of them violated the air space.

Hindu  word invented by Muslims: Veerappa Moily83

Bangalore Former Karnataka chief minister and union minister M Veerappa Moily has kicked up a row. Speaking at a function in Bangalore on Sunday, Moily said that the word 'Hindu' was invented by the Muslims in the medieval age.

Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda disagreed with Moily. Reacting to Moily's statement, he said, "I request people like Moily not to raise such issues. Why are we going back to ancient times, medieval age etc? Can't we live peacefully?"
Reacting to Moily's statement, former PM HD Deve Gowda requested "people like Moily not to raise such issues."

A team of healthcare officials including Chief medical officer of the area on Sunday visited the village.
"The officials came, wrote a few names and left. They did not even give a single painkiller to the flood-affected villagers," Riyaz said.
The residents of the village complained about government's failure to send relief to the area. Riyaz Ahmed, a resident of the village, said the villagers were in dire need of medical aid and no help had reached them after 15 days when flood first hit this part of south Kashmir.
A team of healthcare officials including Chief medical officer of the area today visited the village.
"The officials came, wrote a few names and left. They did not even give a single painkiller to the flood-affected villagers," Riyaz said.
The residents of the village complained about government's failure to send relief to the area. "Whatever food grains we had stored for winters was washed away in the floods, we are lucky to be alive, but now the fear of starvation looms large on the entire village. Residents of nearby villages gave us some food grains, but now that too has finished," Ghulam Mohammed, another resident of Gulzarpura, said.
"The people here need medical help as many of them have already developed symptoms of various waterborne diseases," Ghulam said.
"We requested the CMO for some phenyl, and he gave us a few bottles that too were diluted and when we said that it was not sufficient, he replied that he did not have enough supplies," said Javid Ahmed another resident of the village.
"We have been left on our own, abandoned and orphaned by the government. People from nearby villages are pooling in resources to feed us. We can survive for sometime, but coming winters we will die of starvation as the floodwater has damaged our entire standing crop," said Fayaz Mir, a resident of the village.
After being apprised of the situation, an official of the state health department said, "We have instructed our officials to work day and night to provide medical care to the flood affected people."

BS Reporter | Hyderabad Sep 21, 2014 08:44 PM IST
Tech Mahindra, the country’s fifth largest software services company, which reported just over $3 billion in revenues for the fiscal ended March 2014, is on track to garner revenues of $5 billion by FY17, said executive vice chairman Vineet Nayyar.
“As far as business is concerned, there is growth. And, the outlook is positive. There is a possibility that we will reach that number,” he told mediapersons here on Friday.
On the company’s merger and acquisition plans, Nayyar said their acquisitions were always static and strategic in nature and were not aimed at getting more revenues. “As and when some strategic opportunities are available, we will certainly go for them,” he said.
Stating that the extension of the offset clause to civil aviation would obviously be a help to Tech Mahindra as it had a significant practice in avionics, Nayyar said the company was always in continuous dialogue with the government in sorting out legal issues (related to Satyam) that it was currently facing. “And, if the government (new) sees the way we see it, then hopefully there will be a solution,” he added.
MEC to collaborate with industry
Mahindra Ecole Centrale (MEC), an engineering institute established through a three-way collaboration by Mahindra Group, French varsity Ecole Centrale Paris and Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University-Hyderabad, today organised an industry-academia connect programme to bring the best French and Indian companies on to a single platform for long-term collaborations in the field of research and development.
“Around 20 French and Indian companies, including Biomerieux, Michelin, Renault, BHEL, M&M, Saffron, Vallourec and TCS are part of this programme, which also aims to foster lasting industry-academia synergies in order to bridge the gap between industry expectations and engineering output,” Nayyar said.
The preliminary interest that the French companies have shown is indicative that those would lead to long-term collaborations. MEC would sign MoUs with some of them, he added.

SMS Pharmaceuticals Limited is planning to gradually scale down production at its units in Telangana. On the other hand, the company has decided to invest Rs 950-1,000 crore in Andhra Pradesh over the next four-five years, said its chairman P Ramesh Babu.
"We have five pharma units in Telangana and last year, these units generated a turnover of Rs 300 crore. We have now decided to reduce production in these units due to administrative problems," he told mediapersons.
The company has two facilities in AP - in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts. It plans to invest Rs 400 crore in Vizianagaram unit expansion and Rs 350 crore in the Srikakulam unit. It has taken 40 acres at the Pharma City in Vizag where it would set up an API manufacturing plant with an investment of Rs 200 crore. This would be ready in two-and-a-half to three years, he said.
Of the total required investment, promoters would contribute 35 per cent while the remaining would be from financial institutions, he said. "The company achieved a turnover of Rs 525 crore with about Rs 25 crore net profit during the last fiscal,"he said.

Here s How a Light Bulb Raised $1.3 Million on Kickstarter in 6 Daysreddit
In 1879 Thomas Edison patented the incandescent light bulb. Over the next hundred years the light bulb largely remained unchanged. It was inefficient and it used an excessive amount of energy. Thanks to Phil Bosua and the team behind LIFX that's all changed.
According to LIFX founder Phil Bosua, "LIFX is the world's smartest energy efficient light bulb." LIFX is a Wi-Fi enabled, multi-color, LED light bulb that's controlled by your smartphone. By connecting the LIFX light bulb with your smartphone and your home Wi-Fi network, you have complete control of the lights throughout your home. While this may sound like an unnecessary luxury, there's a tremendous amount of practical applications for this technology.
You can set the mood for a romantic candle light dinner; you can dim the lights for movie night or you can change the color to match your mood. Coming soon, you will even be able to set a nightlight to dim in a remote room of your home. This is perfect for naturally adjusting your body for bedtime. LIFX is also perfect if you're throwing a party and want to groove in style. LIFX creates a mesmerizing multi-dimensional light show that moves right along with the beat.
But wait, there's more! LIFX lasts up to 25 years and uses 4 times less wattage as compared to a standard incandescent light bulb, allowing you to save money on your home energy costs.
There's no doubt that LIFX is an incredible and useful product, and behind every great product is a great story. LIFX was launched on Kickstarter in September of 2012 and raised $1.3 million in just six days. Unlike many Kickstarter success stories, the success of LIFX wasn't generated by a PR blitz. According to LIFX founder Phil Bosua, the team didn't use any marketing or PR to launch their Kickstarter project. So how then did they raise $1.3 million in just six days?
Icanbesociety.com chronicles the stories of Internet elite's like Phil Bosua, who have turned their passion into a lucrative business. I had the opportunity to interview Phil, where he shared LIFX's journey to Kickstarter success as well as a few encouraging words of wisdom for aspiring inventors, entrepreneurs and crowd funders.
What were your business goals and objectives for your Kickstarter campaign?
"The goal of our Kickstarter campaign was to first find out if people liked the idea. We really wanted to know if it resonated before we built it. Secondly, the pledges help fund your first production run so the money we raised was a big part of it."
Why did you decide to seek funding on Kickstarter as opposed to seeking funding from investors or other more traditional sources?
"I was only just becoming aware of the more traditional sources of funding. We're from Australia and we don't have the same well-worn paths to investment that exist in the US so Kickstarter was the only real choice."
Many crowdfunding campaigns have difficulty gaining traction. Did you do any marketing or promotion to draw more traffic to your campaign?
"We didn't use any marketing or PR for the Kickstarter project, not even one out bound email. This was a conscious decision. Early on I remember saying that all the effort we were going to put into PR and marketing should be put that into the Kickstarter project itself. If the product and the project was good enough, people would back it on its own merits."
You surpassed your Kickstarter fundraising goal by over 1,315%. What do you attribute this to and were you surprised by your campaigns' level of success?
"We raised $1.3M in six days and were definitely surprised by the level of success we achieved but it's hard to know exactly what to attribute this to. It was probably a combination of many things. If I had to pick one I'd say through LIFX, people discovered a new way to look at the light bulb. We wanted to create a light bulb that was fit for today's connected world, very different from a traditional light bulb that had not really been innovated in over 100 years."

Written by Madhuparna Das | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:05 am
More and more politicians, bureaucrats, police officers and celebs are being probed as investigation into Saradha and other chit fund scandals spreads beyond Bengal into neighbouring states. MADHUPARNA DAS reports.
Last year, Bhola Pramanik, then 27, a van rickshaw-puller, saw his savings disappear in the Saradha chit fund. So did his mother, who killed herself. Having lost her husband when Bhola was six months old, Urmila Pramanik had worked as a domestic help, a vegetable seller and a daily wager, brought up the boy and put aside some savings, little by little, over 27 years. Mother and son deposited Rs 30,000 in three Saradha schemes, which promised a return of Rs 60,000, and hoped to buy a rickshaw of Bhola’s own.
On April 20, 2013, Bhola woke up to the screams of his mother who had set herself on fire in a small thatched toilet at their mudhouse in a village 40 km off Kolkata. A year and a half later, Bhola is still trying to get his money back. Urmila is listed among 82 investors who have committed suicide.
This week, the scandal claimed another victim in Shankar Baruah, a former director general of police in Assam, who shot himself dead. He was about to be interrogated by the CBI in connection with Saradha’s operations in Assam; he was being probed for allegedly having been paid to “protect” the group of companies.
Victim and subject of the probe, the widow and the policeman represented two ends of a scandal that has touched countless people one way or another in Bengal and neighbouring states. An ongoing CBI probe has unearthed the spread of the company to Assam and similar chit fund cases in Orissa, and also taken investigators to Bihar and Jharkhand.
Across borders
The Bengal government had set up a special investigation team of the police and it ended up unearthing apparent links between the company and ministers, MPs, bureaucrats, and celebrities close to the ruling Trinamool Congress. Several PILs were filed demanding a CBI inquiry, the government opposed it, and the matter went to the Supreme Court which handed the probe to the CBI on May 9. What has followed is the interrogation of a series of high-profile personalities, some of whom have been arrested. The CBI is probing the political connections while the Enforcement Directorate is following the money trail.
The CBI has arrested former DG of Bengal Armed Police Rajat Majumdar, East Bengal Club official Debabrata Sarkar, and businessman Sandhir Agarwal. In Assam, it has arrested Assamese filmmaker and singer Sadananda Gogoi, all of them for alleged dealings with Saradha CEO Sudipta Sen. Also in Assam, it has questioned Assam continued…

Ethiopias agriculture hotlineUpdated: September 22, 2014 00:15 IST
Ethiopia’s agriculture hotline
agriculture
Ethiopia’s farmers are flocking to a hotline that provides free agricultural advice about planting crops, using fertilizer and preparing land as part of a government initiative to turn subsistence farmers into surplus sellers.
The automated hotline has received nearly 1.5 million calls from more than 300,000 farmers since it launched 12 weeks ago, according to Khalid Bomba, CEO of the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA), an internationally backed government initiative. The 90 lines are now taking an average of 35,000 calls a day.
Data on callers
Other African countries have used similar methods to get information to farmers, but Ethiopia’s initial success is unparalleled, Mr. Khalid said. “The numbers speak for themselves,” he said. “It’s working and the farmers are finding it useful.” The advice line is just one of 82 targets on the three-year-old agency’s agenda, which include devising “value chain” strategies for each key crop, increasing the use of higher-yielding seed and making credit more widely available for the nation’s approximately 70 million smallholder farmers. One of its most high-profile projects has been a soil-mapping exercise to understand which areas of the ecologically diverse country are suitable for particular crops and fertilizers.
ATA’s data shows around a quarter of callers to the hotline have been what are known in Ethiopia as “model farmers” or “development agents.” Both groups are used by the government to impart information at the grassroots. The content on the phoneline is replicating advice offered as part of Ethiopia’s Agricultural Extension Programme — a long-standing effort to provide farmers with tutorials and inputs such as seeds and fertilizers.
One young “educator”, Shimeles, was brought to the capital, Addis Ababa, by the ATA to explain how useful he’d been finding the new service, which is available in three of Ethiopia’s main languages: Amharic, Oromo and Tigrinya. He said people’s enthusiasm surged when they found out it was free and that “it was like watching television as the information comes to you”. The government has advertised the initiative on national and local radio but workers like Shimeles “are the best promotion and awareness people,” Mr. Khalid said.
Ethiopia’s government relies on support in rural areas. About 80 per cent of the population of around 90 million live outside towns and cities. An extensive political apparatus reaches down to household level, and according to critics, the regime’s cadres often double as agricultural development agents. The extension system “is driven by political imperatives aimed at effectively controlling the bulk of the Ethiopian electorate,” said academic Kassahun Berhanu in a 2012 paper for the Future Agricultures Consortium, which is partly funded by the Department for International Development.
More surprising than the government’s ability to use its networks to promote the hotline is the huge volume of calls from rural areas. This raised eyebrows because of the unreliability of the state monopoly provider Ethio Telecom. Even in relatively developed Addis Ababa, calls often do not go through or are dropped mid-conversation. And while mobile-phone penetration is at 69 per cent on the continent, in Ethiopia it stands at only 27 per cent, according to the International Telecommunications Union.
The ATA, which takes a highly technocratic approach, describes itself as a “problem solving organisation” that will help propel Ethiopia to middle-income status — an ambition the government wants to achieve in the next decade. Unlike most other government agencies, its staff includes plenty of foreigners and returning members of the diaspora.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Ethiopia’s economic gains have reduced rural poverty rather than just enriching an urban elite, and projected an annual economic growth rate of about 8 per cent over the coming years.
The ATA was supported by Ethiopia’s hugely influential former Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who initially directed its work as chairman of an oversight council. So far, one of the organisation’s main successes has been introducing a package for improved production of the staple cereal, teff, which saw yields increase by up to 73 per cent last year compared to the national average.
The ATA works closely with Ethiopia’s Ministry of Agriculture and other partners including UNDP, USAid, the Nike Foundation, the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation.
Mr. Khalid’s team plans to expand the new hotline to also cover pulses, cotton and flowers, but admits that it has not yet proved its effectiveness at boosting productivity. “Impact is ultimately the driver of everything we have to do,” he said. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2014

The Hidden Source Of Industry Influence That Threatens Our HealthHidden Source Of Industry Influence Threatens Toxic Chemical Regulations
Posted:
reddit
SEATTLE -- Dr. Raymond Neutra adopted an alternate persona as he stepped up to the podium on a sunny, late-August afternoon. Sporting a hat and a fake British accent, the respected authority on environmental health transformed into the fictitious Reginald Charlston, LL.D., of the corporate law firm Dewy, Charlston and Howe.
Speaking to a crowd at the University of Washington, Neutra's character proceeded to explain how he hired scientists to help his chemical industry clients "cast doubt" on "inconvenient truths" regarding the safety of their products. The goal: reinforce roadblocks to verdicts and regulations that could otherwise threaten those corporations' bottom lines.
"I was originally going to represent Dewy, Cheatem and Howe," Neutra, former chief of California's Division of Environmental and Occupational Disease Control, told The Huffington Post after his address, given at the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology conference. "But my wife thought that was going too far."
The session on how corporate money is frequently funneled into researchers' pockets -- a move often undisclosed to the public or even to fellow scientists -- had been inspired by a growing number of real-life occurrences.
Late last year, it came to light that a beloved children's environmental health researcher had been downplaying the health risks of pesticides and lead paint while receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from those very same industries. In March, an accomplished burn doctor was rebuked for fabricating a tale of a burned infant -- while serving as a hired spokesman for a chemical flame retardant industry front group that was created to fend off bans on their product. And controversy continues over the industry entanglement of a prestigious Italian researcher who has testified that continued exposure to asbestos poses little risk to public health.
"If we continue to put poisoned information into the minds of the public, policy is going to be harmed and people will suffer unnecessarily," said Kathleen Ruff, senior advisor to the Rideau Institute, an environmental advocacy group. "Scientists have prestige, influence, voices that are heard."
Such trust and admiration can keep a conflicted scientist's colleagues in the dark as well. Dr. Wael Al-Delaimy, chief of global health at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, had previously worked with Dr. Paolo Boffetta, the Italian researcher.
"It struck us as fellow epidemiologists blindside. We never expected [...] someone who was supposedly on our side of public health and the public interest to work for the interest of industry and not declare it," said Al-Delaimy, who participated opposite Neutra in the conference's mock debate as a critic of undisclosed industry funding.
"We deal directly with issues that affect industry immediately," he added, referring to environmental epidemiologists, who study a branch of science concerned with the patterns and causes of health effects related to environmental exposures. "These industries have a huge influence on regulations and politicians."
Boffetta, formerly with the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and now the director of the Institute for Translational Epidemiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, is under scrutiny for collecting money from and reportedly acting as an expert witness for the asbestos industry. He is also accused of having changed his position on risks posed by chemicals like dioxin and formaldehyde after leaving his post with the cancer agency.
In an email to HuffPost, Boffetta defended himself against the allegations. "My work [has] always been based on science, which I report for peer reviewers and readers to evaluate," he wrote. "It is not influenced by any other consideration."
A number of studies, including surveys of research on food products and secondhand smoke , suggest that when a third party has a hand in funding scientific research, it tends to influence the outcome of that research -- whether the scientists are conscious of it or not.
"We do know that when a study is done with industry funding, it is significantly more likely to produce results that are more favorable to industry," said Bruce Lanphear, an environmental health expert at Simon Frasier University in British Columbia. "That's a fact."
Richard Lemen, former U.S. assistant surgeon general and deputy director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, has expressed concern that financial conflicts are creeping into research even at highly regarded organizations like IARC. He received a response letter this month from the agency's director, suggesting the IARC would consider Lemen's warnings about asbestos industry ties among collaborators on an asbestos study in Russia -- the largest producer of the insulation fiber in the world -- and a published paper , submitted by IARC and co-authored by Boffetta, that was favorable to the product. In the paper, the authors state that they had "no conflict of interest."
While working on that paper, noted Ruff of the Rideau Institute, Boffetta was being paid by an asbestos company to help it defeat charges of criminal negligence in the mesothelioma deaths of a dozen workers.
Lemen suggested Boffetta's case is "just the tip of the iceberg." He also referenced the late Patricia Buffler, a renowned children's cancer researcher and former dean at the University of California, Berkeley's School of Public Health.
"She was another good scientist," Lemen said of Buffler, who passed away in September 2013. "But, at the same time, she almost led a double life."
Buffler served on the board of FMC Corporation, a major chemical manufacturer, for 17 years, a fact revealed by David Heath of the Center for Public Integrity in a report published last December. Buffler never disclosed her relationship with FMC, even while doing research on pesticides and herbicides that could have affected the $2 million worth of stock she owned in the company.
Further, in advance testimony she filed for a high-profile lawsuit against former lead paint manufacturers last year, Buffler wrote that "the risk to children from lead-based paint in homes is not probable or imminent." Buffler received more than $360,000 from those companies to work as an expert witness, according to the Center for Public Integrity. She had never actually published on the safety of the neurotoxic heavy metal.
"It became clear that she'd been involved in a number of really key cases where she may have -- we can't say for sure -- undermined public health because of those personal conflicts," said Lanphear, who moderated the mock debate last month and is helping lead the epidemiology association in developing conflict-of-interest guidelines.
Also uncertain, according to experts, is the extent to which these conflicts have shaped regulations at the state and federal levels -- from bans on flame retardants in furniture to broader reform of the country's outdated Toxic Substances Control Act .
Still, the issue goes beyond the ethics of individual researchers, Lanphear said. Institutions often encourage industry collaborations, as cuts to public funding of scientific research have left coffers dry.
"I don't think we should never take money," he said. "But we need to be clear and transparent."
"At some point, we have to recognize that as long as we don't distinguish between industry-funded research and independent research, the scientific process will fail us," added Lanphear, referring to the muddling of findings on chemical products such as the plasticizer bisphenol A . "These types of conflicts of interest have the potential to undermine billions of dollars in publicly funded research, and can have dramatic impacts on ongoing exposures that harm and kill people. It's that simple."

Scaling up the Gujarat model

The Hindu Jagdish Bhagwati
government
Increased openness to trade and investment will enable India to regain its lost influence, says Jagdish Bhagwati
Prime Minister Narendrabhai Modi — the suffix “bhai” which is used in Gujarat where I am known as Jagdishbhai, is surely derived from the Turkish “bey” and is not merely customary usage but also serves to remind us of centuries of intermingling of Muslim and Hindu cultures and religions in Gujarat — has completed his first 100 days in office . How do we assess his record till date and what advice can we offer him as he settles into his role as the most remarkable Prime Minister we have had since the days of Jawaharlal Nehru?
Political advice is hard to offer to a Prime Minister who managed to win a landslide victory. It would be presumptuous, to say the least. In fact, his instincts have been unerring on how to treat a humiliated Congress with its ruling dynasty finally on the ropes. When I think of the Congress party’s failure to even meet the requirement to be recognised as an official Opposition party in the Lok Sabha, and the aspiration of some of its members known in choice Hindi as “chamchas”) to rally behind a defunct dynasty, I am reminded of the opening scene in the “Gladiator.” The two Roman generals, Quintus and Maximus (who then turns into the gladiator), look at the gigantic Teutonic barbarian who refuses to surrender. Before the Roman generals unleash the mighty Roman Army on the barbarian, Quintus turns to Maximus and says: “People should know when they are conquered.” Indeed, the dynasty-afflicted Congress party has been “conquered.”
Equation with the Congress
The Prime Minister is right to have left the party alone, when, in fact, hounded by numerous inquiries that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government directed against him — unique in the history of selective persecution, as journalist M.J. Akbar has observed — without managing to prove his culpability in the 2002 communal violence, he might well have been tempted to return the disfavour by going after the dynasty and the Vadras. The Prime Minister has rightly left the dynasty and its cronies alone since he understands that a sure-fire way of breathing life into the dynasty, and to the party, would be to persecute it and create sympathy for it (as happened with the prosecution of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi when she lost the election after the declaration of the Emergency).
Narendra Modi is changing our democracy from one that was increasingly aloof to one that shares and seems to care
Of course, some prosecutions and inquiries will be inevitable — as was the case in the surprising Nalanda University scandal which the UPA government tried to sweep under the carpet. But here too, if irregularities by the prominent figures involved in the enterprise are proven in an open inquiry, the Prime Minister should underline the important message that no one should be above the law (a lesson that Muhammad Yunus lost sight of in Bangladesh before he was chastised by the Supreme Court) but should grant a pardon that would put the scandal behind us.
Advice on governance is also not easy to give to a politician whose track record in these matters in Gujarat as Chief Minister was remarkable. It was an insider’s joke that no top-level bureaucrat ever went home; he pretended he was too important and had to attend meetings, when in reality he read novels or comic books. The Prime Minister, in a throwback to Queen Elizabeth the Great who was known to be at work with her secretaries before daylight, has now made his Ministers and top bureaucrats work — not just pretend to work — from morning till dusk, making files move when they often gathered dust.
His uncanny ability to connect with the people has been widely noted and was evident in Gujarat when he asked everyone to send in old nails, doorknobs etc., to be melted down. This would represent their contribution to the huge statue of Vallabhbhai Patel he was building. Their contribution would turn it into a people’s statue.
Similarly, he used his Independence Day speech to connect us with Gandhiji and reemphasise the issue on toilets and the uplift of Dalits (whom Gandhiji called Harijans).
Again, when he applauded a young girl’s graduation, he is reported to have skilfully added that this event gave him more pleasure than his own swearing-in as Prime Minister. And he has argued that it is important to educate boys (who usually grow up pampered) to treat women with respect to address the issue of rape and gender discrimination.
Two problems
His accessibility to the public and the media, contrasted with the unwillingness of the trio of UPA leaders to appear before the public in news conferences — a common practice in democracies, most notably in the American one — has also proven to be a great asset in the governance revolution that the Prime Minister is initiating. Of course, he is a dramatically effective public speaker and is using this talent to great advantage. But he is also changing our democracy from one that was increasingly aloof to one that shares and therefore seems to care.
The Prime Minister used his Independence Day speech to connect us with Gandhi and reemphasise the issue on toilets and the uplift of Dalits
There are nonetheless two problematic areas where the Prime Minister needs to move with due speed. First, he and his Ministers have embraced many popular ideas to spend on housing, public distribution etc. Such increases in expenditures are fine if revenues are raised to finance them. If this is not done, the Bharatiya Janata Party government could repeat the mistake of the UPA-II government, whose tenure saw no match between expenditure increases and intake of revenues because of slowing growth rate, thus promising a rise in inflation. The “popular” expenditure increases then turned “populist,” undoubtedly playing a role in the decimation of the Congress party in the recent election. Unless the Finance Minister turns to this task with speed, the Prime Minister could be imperiled.
Equally, the Prime Minister has to scale up to the national level, as soon as he can, the two elements of his Gujarat success story: increased openness to trade and direct foreign investment. The recent stumble over the World Trade Organization (WTO) can certainly be reversed. But it also needs to be supplemented with substantial opening of the economy that still awaits policy reform. Such opening will not merely bring direct economic benefits, but will also make India’s markets more accessible to other nations that are eager to enter our markets. The Prime Minister should not forget that as long as India was virtually closed for business prior to the 1991 reforms, its political influence in the world had declined.
Increased openness to trade and investment will enable India to regain rapidly, and in a sustained fashion, the influence it lost with ill-conceived autarkic policies in the quarter century preceding 1991.

Horrific Killings Cause News Outlet To Take Major Decision About Freelancingreddit
With the horrific killings of American freelance journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State militant group in recent weeks, news organizations are faced with the difficult task of re-evaluating their relationship with freelancers and the high-risk work that they do. One news agency is now responding by firmly stating that it will not accept any work given to them by freelance journalists traveling in Syria and other dangerous regions.
Agence France-Presse said Thursday that it will "no longer accept work from freelance journalists who travel to places where we ourselves would not venture." The organization said that it hopes the new regulation will help to protect its reporters and prevent AFP staffers from "being used as a vehicle for hateful, ultra-violent propaganda" in the wake of the violent killings of journalists in Iraq, Syria and Africa.
"If someone travels to Syria and offers us images or information when they return, we will not use it," Michèle Léridon, the AFP's global news director, stressed. "Freelancers have paid a high price in the Syrian conflict. High enough. We will not encourage people to take that kind of risk."
Read the full post from AFP here .
For the AFP, that "high price" has been felt first-hand. James Foley, the US journalist who was beheaded by the Islamic State after he went missing in Syria, was a regular contributor for AFP. Weeks later, a second American journalist, Steven Sotloff, was also beheaded in a video released by ISIS. Both men were working as freelancers in Syria when they were taken hostage, a position that now comes with increased risks and life-threatening dangers. Nearly half of the some 70 journalists who have been killed in Syria as a result of the ongoing crisis have been freelance journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Journalists and media organizations are now strongly urging news outlets to reconsider their policies regarding freelancers and the work that they publish.
The AFP is not the first outlet to refuse freelance work altogether. In February 2013, the Sunday Times also rejected war images given to them by a British photographer in Syria, emphasizing that they did "not wish to encourage freelancers to take exceptional risks."
In its post on Thursday, the AFP also addressed the issue of violent or terrorist-related images, and the ethics of releasing and sharing those images with the public. AFP said that although the images can undoubtedly be "atrocious" and "inhuman," it is its duty as a news organization to use them if they contain helpful information.

After 300 days of sleep  Mangalyaan engine will wake up tomorrowComments
With  less than 48 hours left before the spacecraft enters Mars’ orbit, scientists of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) have successfully test-fired its liquid engine.
Before the test-firing, Annadurai, programme director at Isro, told Hindustan Times: “The test firing is like a trial. The dormant engine has to be brought back to life. It is a challenge but if one is prepared well for the exam, the confidence for success is higher.”
The nail-biting prelim was carried out at 2:30pm when the craft’s 440 Newton Liquid Apogee Motor engine, which has been idle for 300 days, was fired up for four seconds. The fourth and final trajectory corrections were also made.
“The engine will be fired for nearly 4 seconds and almost half a kg of fuel will be needed for this operation,” says Koteshwar Rao, scientific secretary, Isro before the test-firing
On September 24 it will be put in action along with eight thrusters to slow down Mangalyaan so it can be injected into a safe orbit around the Red Planet.
Isro launched the Mangalyaan on November 5 to find evidence of life on Mars. If the spacecraft makes it, India will be the fourth after US, Russia and Europe to reach the Red planet. Once in orbit, the craft’s five payloads will take pictures and collect data for the next six months.
Probes to Mars have a high failure rate. Of the 51 missions so far, only 21 have succeeded. A similar mission by China failed in 2011.

Apple could be gearing up to sell 50 million watches next yearApple Could Be Gearing Up To Sell 50 Million Apple Watches Next Year
By Sam Colt | Business Insider –  Thu 18 Sep, 2014 3:24 AM IST
Will 50 million people buy the Apple Watch?
Apple is readying supplies to sell 50 million Apple Watches in 2015, according to DigiTimes .
DigiTimes cites sources at LG Display, which makes displays for the Apple Watch.
There's plenty to suggest that 50 million units would be a heavy lift, even for a tech giant like Apple. As you can see here, Business Insider Intelligence projections for smartwatch sales next year are hover around 30 million units:

Even if Apple were the only player in the smartwatch market, 50 million units would be tough to hit.
Cost is another factor that might impede Apple's smartwach sales. The Apple Watch starts at $349 and the most expensive model could cost $5,000 .
The Apple Watch is expected to hit stores early next year .

Requiem for the Planning Commission
From the stump speeches of Narendra Modi, it is likely that the new entity which will replace the Plan panel will be a body that will dwell on its function as a bridge between centre and states

On 15 August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally announced the demise of the Planning Commission. Together with the fact that it was probably the first Independence Day speech that had no references to the Nehru-Gandhi family, it also signalled a break with an otherwise defining era.
Two things seem obvious. One, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under the leadership of Modi is looking to make a clean break with the past, which has tended to be defined mostly around the Nehru-Gandhi clan—understandably, given its vice-like grip of the Indian polity for most of the first six decades. Second, the government, it seems, has no immediate alternative in mind to the institution of the Planning Commission—evident in the manner in which the government initially spoke in several voices, as also the fact that it is now inviting suggestions from the public. Quite clearly, the Modi government knew what it didn’t want, not what it wanted to create in its place.
Few can quarrel with the government about winding down the Planning Commission as it exists today. It has outlived its original objectives and its most important underwriter, Jawaharlal Nehru, is rapidly receding from the memory of a modern India.
The idea of planned development, as the original notification points out, was first articulated in the appointment of the National Planning Committee by the Congress party in 1938. Six years later, the government of India established a separate Department of Planning and Development. By the end of 1949, the Advisory Planning Board appointed by the interim government had recommended the appointment of the Planning Commission.
It recognized the country’s complex needs. Gaining independence was easier, but dealing with the debilitating colonial legacy was another matter. Firefighting was the name of the game for the new government, leaving it little or no time to evolve a long-term development strategy that would ensure optimal utilization of the country’s scarce resources and correct the inherited inequity in society and among the regions.
The Planning Commission was evolved as the entity that would be free from the burden of day-to-day administration and yet be in constant touch with the government. To cement this symbiotic relationship between the two key entities, the chairman of the Planning Commission was the prime minister and the deputy chairman was a permanent invitee to cabinet meetings.
It was a political call and a good one at that—given the context of that period of history. What it also did was emerge as a repository for some of the brightest brains of India. Their debates, sometimes acrimonious, influenced the Commission and, in turn, the ideology and the thinking of the government.
The seminal moment of the Planning Commission was the formulation of the Second Plan. It laid the basis for a planned economy that would be built on the foundation of the public sector, which was accorded the commanding heights of the economy. Drawn from the experience of the Soviet Union with a planned economy, it was to define the growth strategy for the next two decades.
The next big benchmark was the Sixth Plan that was formulated in 1980. Indira Gandhi had just been returned to power and it was clear that she had undergone an ideological transformation—she was no longer hostile to the idea of market forces.
The Sixth Plan acknowledged this ideological shift and made a compelling case for unshackling the controls on the Indian economy and allowing for greater play to private entities. It laid the foundations of a structural transformation of the Indian economy. Rajiv Gandhi , who succeeded her, accelerated this process, culminating as we know in the Big Bang reforms of 1991.
The gradual rise of the market economy progressively undermined the need for a planned economy. Not surprisingly, the Commission moved away from planning outcomes to indicative planning. However, along the way, the Commission evolved as the secretariat for the National Development Council, the apex body for cementing centre-state relations.
And this function is very much relevant today, especially with a second round of economic reforms to be led by the states even as the coordination between the Union and the states will be crucial in pushing through ideas such as the Goods and Services Tax.
From the stump speeches of Modi in the run-up to the general election and subsequently, it is likely that the new entity which will replace the Commission will be a body that will dwell on its still-relevant function as a bridge between the centre and states. Regardless, it would do well to remember that France had similarly disbanded the idea of a Planning Commission, only to bring it back after a decade.

India  US in harmony; ties to improve: PM ModiComments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed hope about better India-US ties ahead of his visit to the country later this month.
In an interview to CNN, Modi also talked about his vision for a new India, its neighbours and his development agenda, among other issues.
A part of the interview - in which Modi has said "Muslims will live and die for India" - had hogged the headlines recently. The full interview was aired on CNN on Sunday.
Talking about China, a country with which India is locked in border disputes despite the advancement of trade engagements, Modi said, "China must not live in isolation, it must engage with neighbours."
Censorship in China on freedom of speech under the Communist Party's rule has time and again become a matter of debate in the international media; so have allegations over the country's secrecy policy.
"We should have faith that China will accept global laws," Modi said in the interview that came close on the heels of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to India.
On the United States, the Prime Minister said it had many similarities with India. When asked if it was possible for the two countries to develop a strategic alliance despite past glitches, Modi answered in affirmative.
"I have a one-word answer and with great confidence I say 'Yes'," CNN-IBN quoted the Prime Minister as saying.
Modi, who was denied a visa in 2005 by the US in the aftermath of the Gujarat riots three years before, added, "America has absorbed people from around the world and there is an Indian in every part of the world."
He stressed the bonding between the countries in the areas of history and culture.
"The good thing is the mood of both Delhi and Washington is in harmony with this understanding, both sides have played a role in this."
The ties between Modi and the US have shown signs of improvement, with Washington cosying up to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader after his landslide election victory in May.
US defence secretary Chuck Hagel and vice-president Joe Biden had visited India after the BJP's election win.
In the interview, Modi also talked about women's empowerment, echoing his Independence Day speech that had talked about the welfare of the girl child.
"Girl child education is important for the empowerment and development of the country," he said.
Signing off, Modi said he loved to work and making new plans gave him pleasure.

Eye on future PM Modi to meet Hillary and Bill Clinton in New YorkModi to meet Hillary and Bill Clinton in New York
Yashwant Raj , Hindustan Times  Washington, September 21, 2014

Among Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s many meetings during his coming visit to the US, the one with the most profound implications for the future will be with the Clintons.
Modi will meet former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, who is expected to run for the White House in 2016, and win, according to polls.
They are scheduled to meet in New York, where Modi will be from September 26 to 29 for the UN general assembly. And the Clintons live in Chappaqua, near New York city.
No other details were available of the meeting except, according to multiple sources in New York and New Delhi, that the prime ministe will receive the couple in his hotel.
From all accounts, Modi has never met either of the Clintons before, despite the fact that they travel to India frequently — Hillary Clinton was there just this past July.
So was the former president, separately, in connection with a project run by his foundation in Jaipur. He has been a regular, since his first visit as president in 2000.
And they have both said they have been impressed by Modi, for their own reasons. The former president, who is something of a policy wonk, liked the prime minister’s economic policies.
And the former secretary of state has said she was impressed — no prizes for guessing — by Modi’s foreign policy savvy in inviting SAARC leaders to his inauguration.
To put their meeting in perspective, Modi doesn’t have any other past presidents on his schedule — and there are three, George H Bush, Jimmy Carter and George W Bush — so far.
But he is certainly meeting another Presidential hopeful, vice president Joe Biden, who is hosting a state lunch for the visiting prime minister in Washington DC.
It couldn’t be confirmed if the prime minister was meeting any of the Republicans contemplating a run for the White House — it’s a crowded and unclear field right now.
In September 2000, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was in New York for the UN general assembly, spoke with then Republican candidate George W Bush over phone.
The meeting with the Clintons will be special thus.
President Clinton is widely credited with setting the foundation for new relations between the two countries, which were largely on opposite sides during much of the Cold War.
He intervened during the Kargil War by forcing Pakistan to back off, and followed it up with a successful visit to India in 2000, with a rockstar reception in Parliament.
But key to this meeting, said sources, will be Secretary Clinton, who has not announced she is running, but she will most likely, according to her supporters, rivals and most political hacks.
They felt further convinced recently when she and her husband attended a Democratic party event in Iowa, where Barack Obama beat her in the 2008 primaries and turned the race.

Subir Gokarn: Global silver liningsSubir Gokarn: Global silver linings
Subir Gokarn |  Sep 21, 2014 09:50 PM IST
When the G20 finance ministers and central-bank heads met in South Korea in late 2010, the United States Federal Reserve had just initiated the second of what eventually turned out to be three rounds of quantitative easing. This provoked major concerns amongst emerging-market economies, with the spectre of "currency wars" - appreciation due to large, liquidity-driven capital inflows - being raised. Currency dynamics apart, one concomitant of the easing was a steep increase in crude-oil prices, which hit oil importers like India quite hard.
Four years later, as the same group meets in Australia, the global macroeconomic situation looks distinctly different. Admittedly, the turbulence of the summer of 2013 was triggered by the announcement that liquidity would be rolled back. However, even as that process has been at work for the past several months, global markets have been behaving as though there is a permanent situation of easy liquidity. Even as the United States Federal Reserve approaches the point at which it begins to raise interest rates, after more than six years at the zero level, markets seem remarkably buoyant. Is the recurrent post-crisis turbulence now finally behind us? Or is this yet another false dawn, with another adverse shock waiting to spring?
Looking at the situation from India's perspective, I think there are three factors that point to a relatively stable external economic environment in the months ahead. First, there has been a significant softening in commodity prices - most notably oil. Is it just a coincidence that this happened as the United States monetary-policy stance is returning to normal? I think not. Four years ago, prices of oil surged because it and, to an extent, other commodities were seen as attractive asset classes to investors flush with liquidity. Underlying demand conditions mattered relatively little. As liquidity recedes, investors will obviously re-assess their portfolio choices; at their peak-price levels, commodities look less attractive than, say, equity or real estate, which are likely to be more responsive to a business-cycle upturn.
For India, the moderation in oil prices, if it sustains, will yield enormous dividends. It will reinforce the significant narrowing of the current-account deficit, which implies a relatively stable outlook for the rupee. It will greatly help the fiscal situation by reducing the subsidy bill. Last week, the diesel under-recovery disappeared. It will obviously help rein in inflation, creating room for the monetary-policy stance to reverse, which, in turn, will provide some stimulus to growth. But taking a wider view, other economies will also benefit from the moderation, contributing to a broad-based recovery.
The second silver lining is the now unquestionable recovery of the United States economy. Over the past year, notwithstanding an occasional hiccup, the signals from a widening variety of indicators have pointed to a steady growth acceleration and decline in unemployment. Whether the long phase of unconventional monetary policy was the reason for this will be subject of debate for some time to come, but the important thing now is that the recovery will spill over globally through increasing demand for both goods and services.
Yes, commodity prices may also firm up, but at least as far as oil is concerned, the impending expansion of shale oil and gas production in the United States should help to keep prices in check. In fact, some medium-term forecasts point to oil prices falling quite significantly once shale reserves enter the market. This does not, of course, preclude periodic shocks, but given the structural change in the market that the entry shale reserves will induce, these shocks are most likely to be temporary. Overall, the likelihood of a sustained United States recovery combined with a moderating trend in oil prices provides the global economy a significant growth stimulus.
The third factor is also about portfolio re-balancing in a sense, but among investors rather than asset categories. Abundant and cheap liquidity encourages investors to take positions that they wouldn't have otherwise. With particular reference to time horizons, it could be argued that high levels of liquidity induce significant short-term investment into risky assets, including equity and commodities. As liquidity levels moderate, unwinding of these positions has both positive (moderating oil prices) and negative (volatility in capital flows) impacts. The predominance of short-horizon investments in global markets could explain the extreme turbulence that precipitated last summer, in response to the announcement of the intent to roll back on liquidity.
However, as markets adjusted to the new circumstances, investors presumably took into account the future liquidity situation. This would have shifted the distribution of time horizons towards a more "normal" pattern, with a greater proportion of investments being made on the basis of fundamental factors - the prospects of a recovery and the improvement in business prospects that come with it. I would argue that the significantly lower turbulence in response to the actual rollback of liquidity, in contract to the announcement, is a reflection of a rapid change in the distribution of investment time horizons. If this is indeed the case, it bodes well for global financial stability.
Not that there aren't risks, of course. The prospect of escalating conflict in Iraq and other parts of West Asia could well reverse the direction of oil prices. But such risks have always been in play and do not directly impinge on the broader forces of stabilisation. On oil prices, in particular, the medium- to long-term prospects are unquestionably going to be driven by the entry of shale.
This analysis has implications for both global and domestic policy. The G20 can begin to put the crisis of 2008 behind it - the event that gave it its legitimacy - and test its capabilities as a group to address structural issues. There is a good deal of scepticism about whether it should venture beyond crisis response, and it needs to look for ways in which a disparate group of large economies can find common ground on such issues.
For India, the first lesson is a no-brainer, but nevertheless warrants incessant repetition. The best protection against global shocks is a healthy domestic macroeconomic situation. The second, and related, lesson is that a relatively stable global situation over the next few months (and hopefully, longer) could provide a significant window of opportunity to clean up the macroeconomic house. It cannot go unexploited.

A K Bhattacharya: The small route to big successA K Bhattacharya: The small route to big success
A K Bhattacharya | New Delhi Sep 21, 2014 09:48 PM IST
Those who may be complaining about the absence of big-bang economic policy reforms by the Narendra Modi government should draw some comfort from a series of small policy changes initiated in the last three and a half months. The changes may appear small in the manner they were announced, but their cumulative impact on the government's finances is significant. In terms of freeing up substantial government resources currently locked in leaky and poorly-targeted subsidies, these small policy initiatives have made an important contribution to the government's goal of fiscal consolidation - one of the key objectives of reforms.
Some weeks ago, the Modi government issued a notification that effectively meant that the Centre will limit its foodgrain procurement in states that announce any additional financial incentives to farmers for offering their produce to the central procurement agencies. Many states, a few of them ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), objected to the new order since this denied them an opportunity to be a little more farmer-friendly than the Centre - a populist move aimed at winning votes at the cost of fiscal prudence.
But the Modi government has so far ignored such protests. This will have two positive implications - one fiscal and the other agricultural. The Centre's foodgrain procurement cost will come down, reducing its subsidy burden. According to one estimate, the net saving of subsidy on account of this move will be over Rs 5,000 crore, a little less than five per cent of the total annual food subsidy bill of Rs 1,15,000 crore.
Equally important, the crop-growing patterns are likely to change in states that will now desist from announcing additional incentives over and above the central procurement price for foodgrain. Farmers will take a more considered view of what other non-cereal crops they can grow, instead of mindlessly growing only wheat and paddy just because of the extra state incentives. This will help initiate the much-needed crop diversification in these states.
Simultaneously, the Modi government has now decided that it will buy only 25 per cent of the rice needed for supplies through the public distribution system or ration shops. The earlier practice was to procure between 35 and 70 per cent of the requirement. This move, too, will reduce the government's food subsidy bill. The rice procurement season will start from October and if the same system is followed for wheat procurement, the subsidy saving will be even higher.
At another level, the slow work on ensuring the implementation of the national food security law is likely to reduce the government's overall food subsidy bill by at least Rs 20,000 crore. Last year, the total food subsidy bill was estimated at Rs 92,000 crore and the outlay for this year was raised to Rs 1,15,000 crore to provide for the additional foodgrain supplies under the national food security law, enacted in July 2013 with the directive to states and Union Territories to enforce it within a year.
However, only 11 states have implemented the law so far. This necessitated an extension of the implementation date by three months, but no state has come forward and declared its intention to enforce the law by October. Indeed, Gujarat has asked for it to be postponed by one year and there is now a clamour for deferring the implementation of the food security law by a year. If that happens, then the food subsidy bill for the current year can do without the extra provision made in the Budget. And hopefully, the postponement will give the government an opportunity to make necessary modifications in the law to reduce the scope of leakage and improve its effective coverage and targeting.
Yet another move that almost went unnoticed, is to reduce the scope of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme or MGNREGS. It is now proposed to be implemented only in tribal and backward districts, estimated at 200 out of the country's 675 districts. In other words, the scope of the scheme's coverage will come down by almost a third. There are different views within the government and outside on whether the rural employment guarantee scheme should be allowed to continue in its current shape. But the impact of the Modi government's move on its finances will be quite dramatic. The finance minister will be able to save a good amount of money from the annual outlay of Rs 34,000 crore he had provided for this scheme in the Budget.
Cumulatively, all these measures should go a long way in reducing the finance minister's worries over meeting a difficult fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product or GDP. More importantly, they could lay the foundation of a less leaky and better-targeted subsidies programme, whose overall financial burden would also be reduced from the current level of almost two per cent of GDP. This will, of course, go a long way in meeting the promised fiscal deficit target of 3.6 per cent of GDP in 2015-16.
While making such gains durable and sustainable will continue to be a big challenge, it is difficult to ignore the message that comes out loud and clear from the way the Modi government has performed in the last three and a half months. Even in the current political milieu with a BJP majority at the Centre, the government is relying more on small and incremental reforms as it seems to believe that they have a better chance to succeed and make an impact on governance.

Devangshu Datta: Despite jitters  markets stay headstrongDevangshu Datta: Despite jitters, markets stay headstrong
Devangshu Datta | New Delhi Sep 21, 2014 09:46 PM IST
In the 1960s, Nehru and Zhou En Lai coined platitudes about "Hindi-Chini Bhai-Bhai" even as China tightened its grip on Tibet and moved into the territory it claimed in Arunachal and Ladakh. The Xi-Modi Summit meeting had some eerie resonances. Even as they generated photo-ops at Sabarmati, Indian and Chinese armed forces locked into a border stand-off that continues at the time of writing.
The stock market did not really know what to make of it. Quite apart from the border incidents, the summit started with airy estimates that the Chinese will invest $100-billion equivalent in order to outdo the Japanese (who have committed to $35 billion). The reality was closer to $20 billion of Chinese investments, much of which would have come anyhow without the meeting.
Net-net, the Indo-Chinese relationship remains complicated and prickly. Bilateral trade will grow (and so will Chinese surpluses on this account). The Chinese will invest selectively in India and also offer Yuan-denominated exim deals in areas such as power and telecom equipment. At the same time, the border disputes will remain alive.
As of now, the Chinese economy is over four times the size of the Indian economy. Given the relative rates of gross domestic product growth, the differential will increase. As other writers have pointed out in this paper, there is no reason for the Chinese to take India's Great Power or even Regional Player aspirations seriously.
However, while the unchanged Sino-Indian relationship may not have enthused the market, clarifications of the US Federal Reserve's policy stance did bring some comfort. The Fed will continue to taper; it might raise rates a little earlier than anticipated in 2015. But the worst-case scenarios are ruled out and markets responded with relief.
The continuation of the Fed's taper will be compensated to some extent by the European Central bank's stated plans of loosening. Japan continues with its own loose policy and the Chinese say they will follow a policy of targeted-easing. So global financial markets are unlikely to dry up for lack of money.
This concurrence of monetary policy is unprecedented and it may have unpredictable consequences. The Great Depression of 1929-37 was exacerbated and perpetuated by protectionist policies that destroyed trade links as every nation raised tariff and non-tariff barriers against trade. The Crash of 2008 has been followed by every major player increasing money supply. In mercantilist terms, one may see this as every major player attempting to weaken its currency! Where does that lead?
In geo-political terms, there was little substantive change in the fortnight under review, though there was excitement on several fronts. Scotland did not de-link from the UK, after a historic referendum. The Russia-Ukraine-European Union equation stayed as toxic as ever. The US continued to talk about the modalities of taking on the Islamic State without really showing much appetite for this.
Crude and gas prices continued to trend lower. The market is placing weight on the probability of low demand, given slow global growth. It is ignoring the possibility of supply disruptions for the moment. In India, after 19 successive monthly hikes of diesel prices (interrupted by the elections), the current price matches production costs for oil-marketing PSUs.
This will be a great time for the Indian government to decontrol diesel, and also to rapidly rejig the domestic-gas-pricing policy. Perhaps that is wishful thinking, but this sort of pricing sweet spot is unlikely to last too long.
The falling price of crude will have a beneficial impact on the trade balance and current account anyhow. It is one reason wholesale price inflation has moderated to a five-year low, at 3.74 per cent in August 2014 versus August 2013. The consumer price index or CPI is at 7.8 per cent for the same period. Core retail inflation (CPI without food or fuel) is at 6.9 per cent, while core wholesale price index is at 3.5 per cent.
If this moderating trend continues, the Reserve Bank of India could make the upper end of its targeted band of eight per cent CPI by January 2015. The December 2014 index will have to be within eight per cent of December 2013 - that is, the December 2014 CPI will have to be at 149 or lower, given that the December 2013 index was at 138.
Industrial expansion has slowed considerably with the July 2014 Index of Industrial Production up by only 0.5 over July 2013. While this was positive expansion for the fourth month in a row, the momentum is poor. The improvement was patchy. Manufacturing and consumer durables contracted in July 2014 versus July 2013. Power generation grew and so did offtake of intermediates.
On the basis of this data. the pump-priming effect of the general elections has ended and from now on, expectations of acche din will be matched against reality by the electorate. The latest by-elections also indicate that the honeymoon seems to be over.
There were some hopes that the central bank would cut policy rates in its September 30 policy review, given moderating inflation and the industrial situation. But this appears unlikely now, given hawkish statements from the governor. Raghuram Rajan is probably going to wait till January 2015 at the least and several analysts don't expect a hike in fiscal 2014-15 at all.
The market has recovered from a brief bout of jitters, which pulled the Nifty down to 7,930. A purely technical view would say range-trading between 7,900-8,180 is the likely pattern through the September settlement this Thursday. Breakouts above 8,180 to a new all-time high, or a deeper correction to below 7,900 will be of interest. The foreign institutional investors are still net positive, while domestic institutions continue to sell.

Seat sharing row: Uddhav says take it or leave it  BJP looks to Modi for decisionComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party in Maharashtra on Monday rejected ally Shiv Sena's 'final' offer of 119 seats, thus worsening the crisis in the saffron alliance.
BJP president Amit Shah called up Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and urged him not to break the 25-year old alliance, TV reports said. Shah also requested the Sena to rethink on seat sharing for the 288-member assembly polls.
This comes amid indications that the BJP  is readying a Plan B with state leaders telling Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they would rather go it alone than accept this.
Modi is now expected to attempt a reconciliation. In New Delhi, the BJP’s top brass took stock of the seat sharing talks, but kept its cards close to its chest.
After a meeting of its parliamentary board, Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah had a separate 10-minute-long meeting. The party remain tight-lipped about it.
The Sena has given the BJP a breather saying it would wait till Monday. The last date for filing nominations is September 27.
“Modi may not immediately sanction an extreme step and could try and convince the Sena chief,” said a BJP leader close to the developments.
For over a fortnight, the saffron combine has been squabbling over the formula for sharing the 288 assembly seats going to polls on October 15.
Earlier in the day, Thackeray speaking at his party’s national executive meeting in Mumbai, told a cheering crowd of Sainiks to prepare to go solo if the talks did not fructify.
In what his partymen saw as his best-ever public speech, Thackeray said his formula  -- of 151 seats for the Sena, 119 for the BJP and 18 for smaller allies --  was his last-ditch effort to save the alliance.
HT Analysis: Uddhav wary of BJP’s Maha ambitions
The BJP responded within the hour. “We fought 119 seats in 2009, even now they are offering us 119. How is this justified,” asked senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse. Talking in New Delhi, he said the two parties should reshuffle the 59 seats the Sena has not won in the past three elections and 19 the BJP had not won and then arrive at a figure.
“Also, these talks cannot take place through television. We need to sit face-to-face,” Khadse added, saying the BJP was still open to talks, putting the ball back into the Sena’s court. BJP insiders said the party had readied a list of 130 candidates and was waiting for word from the top leaders to release it.
In his speech, Thackeray criticised the present batch of BJP leaders reminding them of how the alliance, formed by LK Advani, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and Pramod Mahajan with the late Bal Thackeray, came together not for power but for Hindutva.
“We had differences of opinion with Mahajan and [Gopinath] Munde too. But our relationship never got strained like it has happened now. We both knew how much to stretch,” he said. He reminded Modi that the Shiv Sena stood by him during the riots in Gujarat.
He also warned the BJP against creating hurdles when a golden opportunity to win the state elections has arisen, just as they kept to the alliance dharma during the Lok Sabha polls.
The Sena chief did not hide his chief ministerial ambitions either. “If you are looking down on the Shiv Sena, then our sainiks are ready to fight back. Get ready to face consequences…. I promise to capture power in Maharashtra at any cost,” Thackeray said.
The state BJP  is bent on teaching the Sena a lesson, but the party’s central leadership thinks a break-up could mar the BJP’s credibility among other allies.
“Any decision needs to be taken with some solid foresight. No doubt that the Sena has us in a catch-22 position, but then we need to find a solution that will go a long away,” said a BJP leader.
While a decision to split has not yet been finalised, the break-up of this long-time friendship is sure to change the political map of Maharashtra for years to come.

EC seeks report from J&K CEO on holding pollsPrint
Written by Maneesh Chhibber | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:32 am
In the wake of the recent flood in Jammu and Kashmir, the Election Commission of India has sought a detailed report from state Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Umang Narula on whether Assembly elections could be held there before the term of the current House ends on January 19 next year.
The EC is also planning to hold consultations with mainstream political parties and other stakeholders on whether Assembly elections should be held now or postponed indefinitely, a decision that would lead to the imposition of Governor’s rule in the state.
Before reaching a final decision on the issue, the EC will also have to take into consideration that a large number of people, especially in the Valley, have been displaced from their homes and may not be able to take part in the electoral process. Also, due to the displacement of such a large number of people, the process of revision of electoral rolls has also taken a hit and is behind schedule. “We are awaiting the report of the CEO, which is likely to reach us early next week, before a final decision can be taken,” said a senior EC functionary.
Sources said the full Commission — the Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners — will visit the state soon and take inputs from Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Sources in the MHA said the ministry was of the view that since the situation is improving fast in the state, elections should be held on time. Union Home Secretary Anil Goswami, who was in Kashmir this week to take stock of relief work, is learnt to have briefed the Centre about the situation. “We will convey our view to the EC when we are asked to do so. With flood water receding and normal life expected to be restored in few days, there is no logic behind postponing the polls. However, a final decision will be taken after proper consultations,” said a senior MHA official.
It is learnt that the prevailing view within the EC, based on preliminary reports sent by various departments and agencies, is that with situation still far from normal it would be certainly be a challenge to hold free and fair elections in the near future. “But, we are told that things are improving. Let’s see,” said an EC functionary.
Incidentally, J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has voiced his opposition to any move to postpone the polls and impose Governor’s rule.

Protests in Jhajjar over cow slaughterPrint
Express News Service | Chandigarh | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:29 am
Badli and neighbouring areas in Jhajjar district of Haryana Sunday saw protests following the discovery of cattle remains over the last few days.
Villagers camped on roads and blocked all entry and exit points to the district, disrupting traffic on national highways connecting Delhi with Rohtak and Hisar. By evening, all entry and exit points to Jhajjar were blocked.
The villagers started camping on NH-10 from midnight and by morning, they had blocked it completely, forcing the district police to divert traffic. Police were deployed in and around Badli and on the borders of Jhajjar.
On September 14, cattle remains were found in Nimana and Majri villages. On the night of September 15, around 22 people suspected to be involved in cow slaughter business were nabbed by police. To protest against the alleged rise in cow slaughter incidents in the region, a mahapanchayat was held in Badli on September 16 and September 18. While the villagers were already agitated, more cattle remains were discovered by a Badli villager late Saturday evening, triggering protests.
Villagers of Dulhera, Daboda, Chhara, Mandothi and neighbouring areas Sunday descended on the highways and blocked traffic.
Activist Gopal Das, who has been raising his voice against cow slaughter in Haryana, joined the protesters Sunday. He declared he would march to the PM’s residence carrying cattle remains if police failed to curb such incidents.
The BJP, too, reached Jhajjar and accused the state of protecting cattle smugglers and those involved in cow slaughter. BJP Kisan Morcha’s president O P Dhankar demanded that President’s rule be imposed in the state.
“We are holding talks with villagers and representatives of protesting organisations. Our priority at this point is to maintain law and order,” said Balbir Singh, SP, Jhajjar.

JU molestation: Partha calls on victims familyPrint
Express News Service | Kolkata | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:27 am
Twenty days after an incident of alleged molestation was reported in Jadavpur University, four days after police allegedly assaulted students protesting against authorities’ inaction in the issue and a day after thousands of students hit Kolkata streets to “make themselves heard”, state Education Minister Partha Chatterjee on Sunday afternoon met the family of the victim.
Accompanied by Trinamool Chhatra Parishad president Shankudev Ponda, Chatterjee spent about an hour speaking to the victim’s family. The victim’s family members declined to divulge the details of the conversation, but said Chatterjee had asked about the girl’s health and had asked why she felt insecure. They added that Chatterjee wanted to know why the victim’s family was not happy with the investigation being carried out by the internal complaints committee of the university.
Adding to the mounting pressure on the state government, members of West Bengal College and University Teachers’ Association (WBCUTA) organised a procession on Sunday. “We took out the procession from Dakshinapan at Dhakuria to 8B bus Stand at Jadavpur. JU professors, along with professors of other colleges, some ex-V-Cs and former lecturers participated in the procession. Besides resignation of the V-C, we also demand a departmental inquiry into the alleged molestation and police crackdown and that all offenders should be booked,” said Tarun Patra, vice president, WBCUTA.
Protesting students, who met West Bengal Governor Kesari Nath Tripathi on Saturday, said a decision on lifting class boycott on the campus would be taken at a meeting on Monday. “There will be a general body meet tomorrow (Monday) which would see participation from JU students as well as representatives of different colleges which took part in the procession on Saturday. Our next course of action would be decided in that meeting,” said a second year postgraduate student of English.
Meanwhile, a group of protesting students have chosen Gandhigiri over outrage.
The students went to meet V-C Abhijit Chakraborty at his Salt Lake residence with a flower bouquet and a ‘get well soon’ card. Although they could not meet the V-C, they left the card and flowers at his doorstep.

La mujer que denunció la violación en la feria de Málaga reconoce que se la inventó, según 'Diario Sur'
EL HUFFINGTON POST

La joven que denunció haber sido violada por cinco hombres en la feria de Málaga el pasado agosto ha reconocido ante la jueza que se lo inventó todo, según cuenta el Diario Sur .
De acuerdo con el medio de comunicación, la joven ha sido interrogada como imputada esta semana por la titular del Juzgado de Instrucción número 2 de Málaga, la misma que archivó su denuncia al entender que no había quedado "debidamente justificada" la perpetración del delito. También han sido llamados a declarar los cinco chicos que fueron detenidos el 17 de agosto acusados de agresión sexual, esta vez como perjudicados.
Cadena Ser aseguraba este miércoles que la Fiscalía había pedido la apertura de un procedimiento por denuncia falsa contra la denunciante. Lo solicitaba, según la información, en virtud de las contradicciones en las que incurrió la supuesta víctima con sus declaraciones, los vídeos y las fotos que fueron aportadas en la causa, el testimonio de los testigos y los informes forenses.
El Diario Sur cuenta que en dicha causa comparecieron primero los cinco jóvenes, quienes tres días después de los hechos declararon que les habían querido "arruinar la vida" , y pidieron seguir adelante con este nuevo procedimiento. Luego declaró la joven, quien admitió ante la magistrada que la violación que denunció no era cierta, y que se la inventó por el temor a que se difundiera el vídeo que uno de los detenidos filmó con su teléfono móvil mientras ella mantenía relaciones.
IMÁGENES, INFORME MÉDICO Y TESTIGOS
La grabación, de un minuto y 25 segundos de duración y hallada por la policía en el móvil de uno de los menores arrestados, fue el primer indicio que hizo dudar a los investigadores sobre la veracidad de los hechos. Las imágenes reflejaban una escena sexual aparentemente "consentida", según insistieron entonces los abogados de los detenidos.
También se encontró una fotografía en uno de los teléfonos intervenidos que hizo sospechar a la instrucción sobre la supuesta violación: un ‘selfie’ en el que la chica aparece en actitud relajada y acompañada por tres de los jóvenes, sobre la colchoneta de las atracciones donde afirmó haber sido violada. La imagen se captó a las 7.27 del 17 de agosto, la misma franja horaria a la que, según la versión de la denunciante, había sido asaltada en una calle del recinto ferial al volver de trabajar.
Además, el informe del forense sobre la lesión de la chica y las declaraciones de los testigos fueron concluyentes. El responsable de la caseta donde la supuesta víctima trabajaba como relaciones públicas declaró que la mujer terminó su turno a las tres y media de la madrugada (y no a las siete como la joven había manifestado). Una amiga de la ahora imputada, con la que había salido esa noche, relató que los jóvenes se acercaron para bailar con ellas e intentaron cogerlas por la cintura. Ella se apartó pero su amiga "sí se mostraba de acuerdo y aceptó bailar con ellos".
Cinco feriantes –cuatro trabajadores de una hamburguesería y la dueña de un puesto de gofres– aseguraron ante la jueza haber presenciado la escena de sexo. Todos coincidieron en su impresión de que la chica no había sido violada. "Si hubiésemos visto que estaba siendo forzada, la habríamos defendido. Éramos seis hombres. Pero no nos pareció que precisara ayuda", aseguró uno de los testigos clave.
La supuesta violación había suscitado mucha polémica a raíz de las declaraciones del alcalde de Málaga o del de Valladolid . Las asociaciones de mujeres también se han pronunciado, advirtiendo del "efecto devastador" del tratamiento del caso para combatir la violencia sexual o de género.

Larry Ellison Out At As Oracle CEOLarry Ellison, Oracle CEO, Is Stepping Down

Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, is stepping down as CEO, according to the company. Ellison, who is the fifth-richest man in the world according to Forbes, was appointed the company's chief technology officer and will also serve as chairman.
Safra Catz and Mark Hurd are both being promoted to the position of CEO. Before joining Oracle, Hurd was CEO of Hewlett-Packard. He was ousted in 2010 after being investigated over his expense reports and an improper relationship with a contractor.
Ellison co-founded Oracle in 1977.
Here's more from the AP:
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is ending his 37-year reign as CEO of the business software maker that he co-founded and is handing over the job to his two top lieutenants, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.
As part of the changing-of-the-guard announced Thursday, Ellison will become Oracle Corp.'s chairman and chief technology officer. Jeff Henley, the company's chairman for the past decade, becomes vice chairman.
Ellison, 70, is likely to continue to play an influential role at Oracle, given his leadership position on the board and his stature as the company's largest individual shareholder.
The shake-up nevertheless opens a new phase in Oracle's history. The Redwood Shores, California, company is trying to adapt to the technological upheaval that is causing more of its corporate customers to lease software applications stored in remote data centers instead of paying licensing fees to install programs on machines kept in their own offices.
Before their promotions, Catz and Hurd were Oracle's co-presidents and had been working closely with Ellison for years. Catz is a former investment banker, while Hurd is best known as the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Co.
Hurd stepped down from HP four years ago after that company's board raised questions about his expense report. Ellison ridiculed HP for its treatment of Hurd, a close friend, and hired him at Oracle.
Ellison, now one of the world's richest men, founded Oracle Corp. in 1977 with $1,200 of his own money. He was its chairman from May 1995 to January 2004.

How Entrepreneurs Can Raise Capital With Easereddit
The future looks bright for early-stage companies seeking capital as we prepare to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the JOBS Act - Title I.
Emerging growth companies (defined as a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year) have enjoyed relaxed requirements around fund raising in the public market. Title I allows companies to submit only two years of audited financial statements, report as a Smaller Reporting Company , and avoid the standard requirement for Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, companies seeking to raise capital from the public market can now submit a confidential S-1 in an effort to test the waters. This allows companies to receive feedback from the SEC prior to committing to a formal initial public offering (IPO).
During the 12-month period from September 15 2013 to September 15, 2014, approximately 370 companies filed to go public. In contrast, only 256 companies filed to go public in the calendar year of 2013.
For early-stage companies attempting to raise capital from the private markets, Title I allows for less regulation around general solicitation and advertising of privately held securities. In simple terms, it allows entrepreneurs the ability to publicly advertise their fund raising efforts. The main caveat is investors must be accredited and entrepreneurs are required by law to ensure investor accreditation by reviewing credit reports, tax filings, and bank statements.
Entrepreneurs can alleviate the verification burden by utilizing fund raising platforms, which verify investor accreditation free of charge. The pioneer in fund raising platforms, AngelList, was founded in early 2010 and to date has facilitated over $200 million in investments.
Syndicates Streamline the Process
At the end of 2013, AngelList announced a Syndicate Program, allowing angel investors to raise committed capital for future investments. This program enhanced entrepreneurs' ability to target seasoned investors with solid track records.  Today, the top syndicate, Gil Penchina , has raised close to $4,500,000 to back promising entrepreneurs.
Pooled capital makes fund raising easier for entrepreneurs who previously needed to reach out to several dozen investors before getting a lead or anchor investor. Entrepreneurs can now focus on syndicates the same way they focus on venture capital funds.
Fund Raising Ecosystem
There are other public platforms available. Second to AngelList is Onevest (a merger of RockThePost and CoFoundersLab), which is backed by Shark Tank's Barbara Corcoran . RockThePost was founded in late 2011 and to date has facilitated over $90 million in investments.  The main difference between AngelList and Onevest is the former is investor focused. On Onevest, entrepreneurs cannot view investor profiles and determine which investor would be the best match for his or her company. However, RockThePost offers educational events for both investors and entrepreneurs.
The Key to Accessing Capital Quick
Investors put their money into companies that have traction. This traction may be in the form of revenue, customers, or simple investor interest. Entrepreneurs should study the investor landscape, secure a lead or anchor investor, and then display their company's profile publicly.
The world of finance is flattening.  It has never been a better time for early-stage companies to raise capital. With SEC relaxing requirements and technology bringing people together, entrepreneurs are raising capital with ease.

How to Get Educated for Freereddit
Time and money seem to be the universally accepted excuses for why someone, logically, can't do something. They are working and have a family, so they have no time to get that degree they desire -- or an unending list of other things they have dreams about. Or, they'd love to go to night school but they can't afford it.
Years ago I was listening to an Earl Nightingale audio program in my car, The Strangest Secret for Succeeding in the World Today, and one of his points has always stuck in my mind. Here it is, paraphrased -- What do you do with your evenings?  Most of us spend "X" number of hours in front of the television. If you were to channel that time into a productive endeavor, you could accomplish awesome things. In fact, in "X" years you could study to become a heart surgeon!
What are you trading your time for?
What's your dream? Where could you carve out some time?
I get it. All of us aren't willing or committed to using our evening or weekend hours in pursuit of something. We have family commitments. We need to recharge. Nothing wrong with that.
But what could you do with the time you currently have that is 'dead' time? You know, the time waiting in lines, driving the car, getting ready in the morning, the few minutes in bed before you go to sleep. What could you learn? What could you get excited about? How could that help you excel at your career? How could you use it to become a better parent?
Here are a few ideas to help get you moving in the right direction --
1. Listen to Podcasts
a. Most of us have a Smart Phone today.  I listen to podcasts while walking every morning, and I'm amazed at what I'm learning -- 1) SEO - Search Engine Optimization, 2) Building income streams, 3) Getting inspired for my day
b. If you have an iPhone, you can download podcasts directly from the iTunes Store.  I've found that the Podcast Addict app works great on my Android and new episodes download automatically.  Search for podcasts that interest you.
c. Here's an idea to get you started on your first Podcast.  If you have a job or you are a parent, there is information you can find of value in Manager Mojo with Steve Caldwell, a program about successful leadership. Check out the various programs here , and you can subscribe through iTunes or Stitcher Radio.
d. My wife uses the time spent getting ready in the morning to listen to uplifting, motivational programming.  That includes my podcast and a couple of other programs.
2. Use your car as a University
a. Do you listen to music or the news while driving?  Well, first of all, stop listening to the news, as it is filling your mind with negativity.
b. Start listening to audios that interest you -- those that will prepare you for the next promotion at work, help you learn another language, educate you about a topic of interest.  You can find an abundance of free audio learning at your library.
There's even a good chance you can go online and research what your library offers, put it on hold, and they will inform you when it is available for pick-up.  Now that's an efficient use of your time!
3. Read a Book
a. I've just mentioned using the library.  Go online and see if they have a book you're interested in, then put a hold on it.  If they have an audio version, listen through your Smart device or in your car.
b. I set aside the first 30 minutes of every morning to read a book.  I set a timer, and when it dings I move on to exercise.  My wife uses the last 10-20 minutes of the day to read before she goes to sleep.  She enjoys using the last few minutes of the day to learn something new, and it allows her subconscious to process and ruminate on that info while she sleeps, further enhancing her learning experience.
It seems that we are all facing time challenges, and those who are in the midst of a demanding career while also raising a family definitely have a full plate.  Yet, everyone also has personal dreams and desires.  When we look for the moments in our days that are available to accomplish something that is important to us, life seems to take on a new zest and zeal.
You desire to be your best.  You want to be successful in work and life.  Use those extra moments to help you enjoy the career and life that you desire.

Anacostia cafe serves up expansionBy Abha Bhattarai September 19 Follow @abhabhattarai
Kera Carpenter, owner of Nürish Food + Drink in Anacostia, plans to add an annex, a garden cafe and more kitchen equipment.(J. Lawler Duggan for Capital Business)
In the six months since she quietly opened Nürish Food + Drink in Anacostia, Kera Carpenter has learned to make the most of her small kitchen. She has seared pork loins using a panini press and blanched asparagus using an espresso maker.
“I have ‘MacGyver-ed’ some pretty amazing food out of this kitchen,” Carpenter said, gesturing toward the countertop that holds all of the cafe’s equipment: a microwave, panini maker, espresso machine and a small convection oven Carpenter has dubbed her “tiny Easy Bake Oven.”
She bakes all of her pastries here, and creates tartines, chicken confit and blueberry cheesecakes in the cafe’s open kitchen. The idea, she said, is to help bring fresh, healthy food to a neighborhood that has long relied on fast-food eateries and carry-out restaurants for meals.
The French-themed cafe and wine bar comes nearly a decade after Carpenter opened Domku in the District’s Petworth neighborhood before it became the trendy hotspot it is today. With Nürish, Carpenter is forging a similar path with hopes of helping draw more entrepreneurs to Anacostia.
“Nürish has a real coffeehouse ambiance that Anacostia has not had in a while,” said Edward S. Grandis, executive director of the Anacostia Business Improvement District. “We do have sit-down restaurants and we do have carry-outs, but this type of coffeehouse is new to the area.”
Armed with an $85,000 grant from the District’s Great Streets program, Carpenter plans to expand the small cafe by building an annex, purchasing more kitchen equipment and adding a garden cafe to the back of the restaurant.
She would not disclose start-up costs, but said she raised $15,000 using the Web site Clovest, and took out a bank loan to finance the rest of the business.
Carpenter built much of the furniture at the cafe herself, repurposing old chairs and fashioning light fixtures out of copper tubing. The walls, painted a cotton candy pink, are bare. But, Carpenter said, all that will evolve with time.
“Eventually we’ll change things as we have money,” she said, adding that she took a similar approach with Domku, which specializes in Scandinavian food. “I knew that it would be difficult in the beginning. I wanted to minimize the up-front costs knowing what was ahead.”
The biggest challenge, she said, has been attracting new customers. The cafe’s perch at the back of the Anacostia Arts Center doesn’t lend it a lot of visibility. There have been other surprises along the way, too. Beer and wine sales have been very slow, and the bustling nighttime business that Carpenter relies on at Domku seems to be elusive in Anacostia. The restaurant is now closed on Mondays, which turned out to be a slow day for lunch business. Sunday brunch also got nixed.
“The cycles of business are the complete opposite of what they are at Domku,” Carpenter said. “We thought Sunday brunch would be huge, but it turned out to be very quiet. Most people go to church and then they have family dinners.”
Jehiel Oliver, who works at a business incubator next door, stops by Nürish almost every day. Before discovering the cafe, he often bought a slice of pizza or walked home for lunch.
“I’ve been coming here since they opened,” said Oliver, 32, who was camped out at the cafe’s bar with his laptop one morning this week. “It’s nice to have a more healthy, interesting food option.”
Before opening the cafe, Carpenter — who has a background in international development and a master’s in education policy — worked with a handful of pop-up restaurants in the neighborhood, including a chicken-and-waffles eatery at the arts center. She is also the founder of Nürish: The Center for a Creative Culinary Economy, a nonprofit incubator for restaurateurs.
She said she hopes Nürish’s presence in Anacostia will inspire more restaurateurs to open cafes and standalone eateries in the neighborhood.
“I would love it if one day when I say to people, ‘I opened a restaurant in Anacostia,’ they would stop gasping in horror,” Carpenter said. “I know that’s a long way off, but that’s my hope.”

Scottish Referendum Poll Gives  No  Win By 54% To 46%Scottish Referendum Poll Gives 'No' Camp Win By 54% To 46%
PA/Huffington Post UK
reddit
Scotland will remain part of the UK after the independence referendum, pollster YouGov has predicted, as it forecast the No campaign would win the crucial vote. The polling firm predicted that 54% of people north of the border would vote No, and that 46% would back independence.
Such a result would give pro-UK campaigners a more comfortable victory than some recent polls had suggested. YouGov contacted 1,828 people after they had voted today, as well as 800 who had voted by post.
So that's that. Polls have closed. What an amazing, emotional, inspirational day of democracy this has been. Now we wait. #indyref
— Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) September 18, 2014
All those who took part in the research had previously been polled, allowing the company to see if there had been a last-minute swing to either side on the day. YouGov said its responses suggested there had been a small shift from Yes to No on polling day, and also that No supporters were slightly more likely to turn out to vote.
It released its findings just 30 minutes after polling in the independence referendum closed.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told the BBC she is quietly confident that the "silent majority" of Scots would give a victory to No. She said: "I think we have a confidence, a quiet confidence, that the quiet majority of Scots have spoken."
Ms Davidson said whatever the result, politics in Scotland would change, with the promise of more powers for Holyrood in the event of a No vote made by all three of the main parties.
Police officers stand between YES and NO supporters in Glasgow
"The status quo has been thoroughly smashed, whether it is a Yes vote or a No vote Scotland is going to change after this," she said. "The question is does it change within the United Kingdom or does it change out with the United Kingdom."
The Tory MSP said the two-and-a-half-year long referendum campaign had been an "almost wholly positive experience", adding: "We've had the biggest, broadest, most open conversation amongst the people of our country on any single issue and it's a conversation that I think we needed to have."
YouGov president Peter Kellner said he was 99% certain that Scotland would vote to remain in the UK. He told Sky News: ''At the obvious risk of looking like a complete prat in eight hours' time, I would say it is a 99% certainty of a No victory... I can't see no losing this now.''
This has been a remarkable day. Scotland's future truly is in Scotland's hands. #IndyRef pic.twitter.com/buvgOO9j7p
— Alex Salmond (@AlexSalmond) September 18, 2014
Mr Kellner said today's research had suggested ''substantially more'' people switched from Yes to No than the other way around. He added: "'If we have got this wrong, if Yes win, we and by extension other pollsters, have got something badly wrong."
SNP MSP Humza Yousaf conceded the Yes campaign were the "underdogs" in the referendum. But the Scottish minister for external affairs and international relations told the BBC: "We relish that status as the underdogs."
After YouGov predicted the result would be a vote for Scotland to stay in the UK, Mr Yousaf said: "We've had one poll, but it's not an exit poll and it certainly won't take into account the high levels of turnout that we're seeing and hearing about across the country."

ALBANY, Ga. (AP) — Food safety advocates say a guilty verdict in a rare federal food-poisoning trial should send a stern warning to anyone who may be tempted to place profits over people's welfare.
More than five years after hundreds of Americans got sick from eating salmonella-tainted peanut butter, the top executive in the company that owned the Georgia plant where it was made was convicted Friday of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, wire fraud and other crimes related the nationwide outbreak in 2008 and 2009.
Former Peanut Corporation of America owner Stewart Parnell, 60, could face more than three decades in prison for the outbreak that was linked to nine deaths and prompted one of the largest food recalls in U.S. history. His brother, Michael Parnell, and another co-defendant could face 20 years in prison or more.
Experts said it was the first time American food processors have gone to trial on federal charges in a food-poisoning case. Food safety advocates applauded the jury verdict reached after a seven-week trial, though they also noted the case was unusually egregious.
"The message it sends is actually a pretty simple one: If you deliberately ship and sell contaminated food, there's now a good chance you might go to jail," said Jaydee Hanson of the Center For Food Safety. "That's good news. The bad news is deliberately shipping adulterated product is not what causes most of the salmonella outbreaks we've seen."
The brothers will be allowed to remain free pending sentencing if they can post bond. Federal marshals led them from the courtroom.
Stewart Parnell was convicted of knowingly shipping bad peanut butter to customers who used it in products from packaged crackers to pet food. The jury also found him and his food broker brother guilty of faking results of lab tests intended to screen for salmonella.
Prosecutors said the brothers used the fake results so wait times for real tests wouldn't slow down their hectic shipping schedule to customers including Kellogg's.
Mary Wilkerson, the peanut plant's quality control manager, was convicted of obstruction of justice for withholding information from investigators, as was Stewart Parnell.
The outbreak sickened at least 714 people in 43 states by the time federal investigators traced it to Peanut Corporation's plant in Blakely, in January 2009. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nine people who ate the tainted peanut butter died, though it couldn't say for sure salmonella caused each death.
Federal investigators found a plant with a leaky roof, roaches and evidence of rodents — all ingredients for cultivating salmonella. Even worse, they eventually uncovered emails and records showing food confirmed by lab tests to contain salmonella was shipped to customers anyway.
"Corporate officials are now on notice that they'll be held to account for their conduct and claims of ignorance of arguments that 'I was too busy' or maybe that 'I delegated the responsibility to someone else' or even just finger-pointing in general will not be a shield from basic responsibility," said U.S. Attorney Michael Moore, whose office in Georgia's Middle District prosecuted the case.
Defense attorneys acknowledged during the trial that the plant shipped tainted peanut butter and somebody faked lab tests. But they blamed two former plant managers who had pleaded guilty in the case.
"We respect the jury's work and the jury system, but we believe this was the wrong result," said Tom Bondurant, Stewart Parnell's lead attorney. "We'll continue to fight for Stewart at sentencing and in an appeal."
Michael Parnell's attorney, Edward Tolley, noted his client was acquitted on about 20 counts linking him to the actual shipments of contaminated products.
The Parnell brothers and Wilkerson were indicted on a total of 71 counts last year. They weren't charged with sickening or killing anybody, but rather were accused of defrauding customers. Still, their sentences are likely to be long.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Dasher estimated the Parnells will likely get 27 to 33 years in prison, which would "in effect be a life sentence" for the middle-aged brothers. Wilkerson faces a maximum term of 20 years.
Marshall Tousignant's father — 78-year-old Clifford Tousignant — died in January 2009. He was sickened by salmonella from tainted peanut butter sandwiches at a nursing home.
"It's great to hear he's not getting away with what he thought he would get away with, I guess, that justice is going to be served," the Brainerd, Minnesota, man said of Stewart Parnell.

Business books of the decade
The Business Book of the Year Award has selected 152 books for its longlists since 2005. Together the longlisted books constitute a reader’s guide to a turbulent decade for business, media and publishing, with the financial crisis at its centre
The world wants to know Silicon Valley ’s secret. Here, in three books by four highly successful tech entrepreneurs and investors, are some of the answers. Only, don’t expect them to agree on how you should go about making your first billion.
Creating a great start-up, it appears, is a cerebral game of chess, one that isn’t worth playing unless you’ve thought through how you’re going to win before you even start. That is, if it isn’t a gut-wrenching rollercoaster ride in which pure courage (along with a fair amount of puking and tears) are the only things that will get you through. Or then again, it may turn out to be mainly an exercise in organising very large numbers of creative – even brilliant – people in a loose but co-ordinated way that has never been achieved before in business history.
More
Remembering the fall of the Berlin Wall
As this suggests, there is no simple – or single – formula. Since entrepreneurialism is by definition one of the great pragmatic exercises, how-to books can take you only so far. “Today’s ‘best practices’ lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried”, writes Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, hedge fund investor, venture capitalist and Facebook director). But the collective advice and – more importantly – first-hand experiences of some of Silicon Valley’s most successful figures of the past 15 years certainly provide some pointers.
In Zero to One, Thiel makes the start-up business sound almost mystical: “by creating new technologies,” he says, “we rewrite the plan of the world”. Out of nothing comes the start-up (hence the title). It isn’t a bad way to think about things. Entrepreneurialism requires, more than anything, sheer creative energy: not just originality but the intellectual concentration and determination to succeed, sometimes seemingly against all odds.
Thiel is the ultimate contrarian. Think of something you believe that nobody else does, he recommends, then go and make a business out of it. In this world, many of the accepted techniques of the current generation of Silicon Valley start-ups – look for incremental advances, stay lean and mean, keep iterating on the product and let sales take care of themselves – are rejected. Go big or go home.
 
An accomplished chess player, Thiel is a big believer in thinking out the best business before you start. Any talk of “pivoting” – a favourite Silicon Valley word of the moment, used to describe how companies that fail at one thing keep adjusting goals until they hit on something that works – would get short shrift if he was an investor.
Similarly, Thiel takes a dim view of Silicon Valley’s present obsession with “disruption”, a “self-congratulatory buzz­word for anything posing as trendy and new”. People who think of themselves as disrupters are too busy being distracted by the “dark forces” they think they’re unseating to focus on the real job at hand, of coming up with great products.
Thiel’s tips include never trusting anyone in a tie – at least, not if they’re claiming to be tech entrepreneurs
The best business opportunities of all, says Thiel, are monopolies: why bother with the wasteful process of competition when you can own it all? His justification for digital monopolies is that they aren’t like the static, rent-collecting monsters of the old economy: these are dynamic platforms that bring new value to the world (think Apple’s iOS mobile software platform or – Thiel doesn’t mention it – Facebook).
Thiel, as a fan of dominant companies, clearly can’t understand why two of the greatest monopolies the tech industry has created should have set about the wasteful business of trying to destroy each other. He writes: “Just as war cost the Montagues and the Capulets their children, it cost Microsoft and Google their dominance: Apple came along and overtook them all,” with the iPhone.
It is a shame that, in How Google Works, Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg don’t address this question head-on. Schmidt, as former chief executive, and Rosenberg, as former chief of product development, played central roles in building Google during a key phase in its existence, from the period before its 2004 initial public offering.
Their book begins, tantalisingly, by describing how board member Michael Moritz called for an urgent meeting in the company’s early days to come up with a strategy to defeat Finland (a code name, it turns out, for Microsof t – though the authors then spoil their own anecdote by revealing that this a code name for the real code name).
Some of Google’s most important (and successful) initiatives, such as its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system, look like deliberate attempts to counter Microsoft’s main software platforms. So it’s ironic that the European Commission is considering launching a competition investigation into whether Google uses Android to block competitors, a case that would have direct parallels with an earlier case over Microsoft’s Windows.
 
Yet in this book, any discussion of competitive strategy is quickly buried. The authors brush off things they did to counter Microsoft as “a few tactical points”, instead coming up with platitudes about how focusing on the product and delivering the best user experience were the keys to holding the software giant at bay.
Schmidt and Rosenberg put much of their emphasis on people: how to hire, train, motivate, organise, reward (and occasionally sack) the talent needed to run a company like Google. Though the company’s culture is known for its enviable perks, they stress the importance of the hothouse atmosphere they created by jamming workers together in overcrowded cubicles (forget about working from home).
They also have a simple rule for any company in the tech world: double down on the engineers. By keeping this in mind at a time when Google’s product strategy was in danger of bloat, they claim to have kept the company focused on true innovation. In such a culture even Sheryl Sandberg , a key employee and now number two at Facebook , could be turned down for a job the first time around because she lacked an engineering background.
The question that looms large over any book like this is whether Google’s leaders have truly been brilliant in organising a 21st-century model of what a deeply innovative corporation will come to look like – or whether, with search advertising, they were just lucky enough to stumble on the biggest cash machine the advertising industry has ever produced. The jury is still out on whether the culture they have built – and all that money pouring out – can produce the innovation to carry Google into a future beyond search.
For a more down-to-earth view of start-up life after these big claims, The Hard Thing About Hard Things makes the perfect antidote. Ben Horowitz, who went through two start-ups before launching a venture capital firm with partner Marc Andreessen, gives a warts-and-all view of what it’s really like to be in charge of a business weeks away from running out of cash, threatened by the loss of its biggest customer or outflanked by a competitor with a better product. His seat-of-the-pants answer: “There is always a move.”
 
It is the real-world anecdotes that produce the most telling lessons in books such as these, and Horowitz comes up with some of the best. If you wondered how stress-inducing it is run a start-up, it’s all here – right down to agonising about whether excessive use of the f-word should be kept as part of a new company’s culture (the cursing stayed). Thiel has tips of his own. They include never trusting anyone in a suit and tie (at least, not if they’re claiming to be tech entrepreneurs): it was these well-dressed types who were behind many of the failed alternative energy companies Silicon Valley invested in recently, he claims.
Schmidt and Rosenberg, meanwhile, lift the lid only occasionally on life inside Google – a company they continue to serve as, respectively, executive chairman and adviser. Among their more revealing anecdotes is how co-founder Larry Page, when he was unhappy about a new Google advertising format, simply posted a public message that “These ads suck”. The message inspired a group of engineers not even responsible for the problem to come up with a solution, they say. Management by humiliation might be frowned on elsewhere, but apparently it works at Google.
Still, as always with books told from the front lines of business, you can’t help thinking that the really juicy stuff has been held back. In the clubby world of Silicon Valley, after all, it doesn’t pay to tread on too many toes.
What is left from reading these books is a sense of the conundrums that even the most successful tech start-ups find hard to solve. Hiring the best talent and “scaling” – or growing at breakneck speed before another company can come along and steal a new market – are two of the main skills of Silicon Valley. But even there, they can be challenging.
Schmidt and Rosenberg, for instance, warn of the “knaves” whose personal ambitions can wreck a company – though they beg patience for talented “divas” who can also stretch the patience. Horowitz has his own categories of workers – usually highly intelligent – who are liable to sink a company: heretics, flakes and jerks. Then there are “old people” – code for those who come from bigger companies with more experience, and who may damage the culture. Is this how tech CEOs talk about their staff behind closed doors?
Another common problem concerns size: there are no easy answers here for how to retain a new company’s dynamism as it grows. Thiel catches the problem with his astute definition of a start-up: “The largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.” What happens to that shared purpose when it exceeds that number?
Horowitz sums up the horror that awaits: “At a certain size, your company will do things that are so bad that you never imagined that you’d be associated with that kind of incompetence.” Seeing workers start to waste money, produce sloppy work and waste each other’s time “may well make you sick”, he warns aspiring chief executives.
All three of these books have their flaws. Thiel’s book was stitched together from classes he has given at Stanford University by an eager student and joint writer, Blake Masters, while Horowitz’s work is partly built out of a series of long blog posts. But they all deserve a place on the bookshelf of aspiring entrepreneurs. If nothing else, you will know how to dress – and curse – the next time you approach a venture capitalist to raise money.

SCO membership to help India get foothold in...Central Asia
(India does not want the pipeline,…)
NEW DELHI: India will get a major boost in its quest for greater access to hydrocarbons in Central Asia as it is all set to get full membership of the Shanghai Corporation Organisation,comprising all major energy producing nations of the region and dominated by China and Russia.
India, one of the largest energy consumers in the world, is keen to get the membership of the grouping as it will help it play a major role in the SCO energy club which was set up to create a unified energy market as well as to ensure cooperation among major oil and gas companies from the member nations.
Three major suppliers of energy -- Russia, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan - have been playing crucial role in the SCO energy club and the Indian government feels getting membership of the bloc will give it greater access to a number of key energy projects in the region.
Government sources said SCO membership will also help to make headway in the proposed pipeline project from Russia to India, being billed as one of the most ambitious initiatives in recent years in the energy sector in the region.
India does not want the pipeline, which may cost over $40 billion, to enter India through Pakistan and may look for alternative route including through China.
"The SCO membership will help India get a foothold in major energy projects involving Central Asian countries. It will ensure India's integration with the region," a top government official told PTI.
India had formally applied for membership of SCO in its summit meeting in Dushanbe on September 12 where External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had said India was ready to step up engagement with the grouping.
India is almost certain to get the SCO membership within a year as China has backed the move. India has been an observer at SCO since 2005 and has generally participated at the ministerial-level at summits of the grouping which focuses mainly on security and economic cooperation in the Eurasian space.
India's key ally Russia has been favouring India's permanent SCO membership, saying the largest democracy joining the group will add weight to the organisation. Another major oil-producer Iran is also aspiring to become member of the SCO.
SCO was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the Presidents of Russia, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India, Iran and Pakistan were admitted as observers at the 2005 Astana Summit.
Last week, during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Chinese President Xi Jinping had supported India's bid for SCO membership.
Officials said an SCO membership will help India address its growing energy needs. India has oil deals with Russia, Kazakhstan and was working on a gas deal with Turkmenistan.
They said the SCO platform will also help speedy implementation of the TAPI (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan- Pakistan-India) gas pipeline project
The nearly 1800-km-long TAPI pipeline would originate from Turkmenistan and pass through Afghanistan and Pakistan before entering India.
It will have a capacity to carry 90 million standard cubic metres of gas per day (mmscmd) for a 30-year period and scheduled to be operational in 2018. India and Pakistan would get 38 mmscmd each, while the remaining 14 mmscmd will be supplied to Afghanistan.
Kazakhstan had recently offered ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) a stake in medium-sized Abai oil block in Caspian Sea.
The Indian government is of the view that SCO membership will offer India more opportunities to work closely with China in certain areas including in Afghanistan.
India also feels as SCO member, it will be able to play a major role in addressing the threat of terrorism in the region.
India is also keen to deepen its security-related cooperation with the SCO and its Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS) which specifically deals issues relating to security and defence.

Time to return favour: Uddhav s message to Modi | Sena s final offer: 119 for BJPBal Thackeray
(Uddhav was echoing what Bal Thackeray had…)
MUMBAI: Driving a hard bargain with BJP over seat sharing in Maharashtra assembly polls , Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray today reminded Prime Minister Narendra Modi that after 2002 Gujarat riots his father Bal Thackeray had prevailed on L K Advani not to remove Modi as Chief Minister.
Asserting that the alliance should stay "as it is for Hindutva", Uddhav said, "Everyone knows how terrible the situation was when the Godhra riots took place.
"Everyone was saying that Modi should be immediately removed from the Gujarat CM's post. At that time, it was only Balasaheb who told L K Advani that Modi should stay on as he pursues the Hindutva ideology," he said.
Uddhav was echoing what Bal Thackeray had reportedly said in an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' in February 2009.
"Modi gaya to Gujarat gaya (If Modi goes, Gujarat will also slip out of BJP's hands)," Bal Thackeray had claimed to have told Advani on moves to remove Modi after the communal riots in Gujarat.
"There were hectic moves to remove Modi from the post after the Godhra riots. We clearly told Advani that Gujarat will be lost if Modi is removed," Thackeray had said in the editorial.
Bal Thackeray died in November 2012. Uddhav today reminded Modi that just as Sena did not play a spoilsport in BJP's "Mission 272' in the Lok Sabha polls, BJP should now respect Sena's 'Mission 150' for the Maharashtra polls.
"There are Shiv Sena workers in UP, Rajasthan and MP as well. They all wanted to fight elections saying they have been with Sena for long and thus deserve a chance. But we didn't let them contest (against BJP/NDA candidates). Now it is Shiv Sena's turn. It is our mission to send at least 150 MLAs to the Vidhan Sabha. BJP should consider this," he said.
"I feel from the bottom of my heart that the alliance should stay as this alliance is not for the Chief Minister's post but for Hindutva. But whatever happens will be my destiny. We are ready to contest all the seats," the Sena chief said.
Shiv Sena today said it will fight on 151 seats, leaving 119 seats for BJP and remaining 18 seats for other allies
"I want power and I will take it at any cost. But this power is to give Maharashtra something and not to take away, like other parties do," Uddhav said.

Social media campaign now targetsgrassrootsPrint
Written by Manasi Phadke | Mumbai | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:06 am
Debunking the myth that social media is only for the urban elite, political parties, even the smaller outfits, in Maharashtra are exploring social networks to reach out to the grassroots — a quantum leap from the 2009 Assembly elections when campaigning was largely restricted to hoardings, banners and rallies.
This year, the elections are characterised by micro-level targeted campaigning on local issues using mobile applications. Whether it is a small party or a big one, they have teams ranging from 500 to over 20,000 people dedicated to party propaganda using social networking. Even an outfit like Ramdas Athavale’s RPI, which currently doesn’t have a single seat in the Assembly and is likely to contest less than 10 of the 288 constituencies, has opened media centres in all the districts of Maharashtra. These centres maintain a database of all potential voters and share messages about the party and its leaders on WhatsApp and Facebook.
“Earlier, it used to be all about political campaigning. Now it’s political marketing. Marketing a party or a candidate is like selling a new product to voters. We aren’t leaving a single platform unused, whether it is Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, or even the traditional media,” said Mayur Borkar, public relations officer of RPI(Athavale).
The Congress too has carved out a team of 4,830 volunteers for social media campaigning. They make creative messages, infographics, said Dilip Chalil, in-charge of IT and social media of the party. The BJP, which had run Narendra Modi-centric campaign in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, has this time focussed on local issues with tailor-made campaigns, all designed by party volunteers.
“This time, we are generating local content in the form of humorous comic strips to reach out to the grassroots,” said Jiten Gajaria, convenor of state BJP’s social media cell. Vijay Mukhi, a cyber security expert, said, though parties are catching up with technology, they still have a lot to learn. “The idea of social media is to engage with the audience. I don’t see those type of messages,” Mukhi said.

Madras HC order seeking reason for RTI plea illegal  sayexpertsPrint
Written by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:58 am
A recent Madras High Court order insisting RTI applicants to disclose the reason for seeking the information has sparked a debate with several legal experts and activists calling it an attempt to derail the RTI Act.
Terming the HC order “illegal”, a senior jurist in the Madras HC said the Section 6(2) of the Act clearly says an applicant making request for information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information. “This HC order contradicts with the very essence of the law,” he said.
A division bench of Justices N Paul Vasanthakumar and K Ravichandrababu on Wednesday had upheld a High Court official’s refusal to part with information relating to the appointment of law officers in the court. It said RTI applicants must give reasons for the query and that the information about the appointment of registrar general could not be brought under the RTI Act as it pertained to the internal functioning of the court and was not related to public interest.
Sindhu Shivalingam, Chennai-based anti-graft activist, said such orders would make the RTI Act toothless.
Former judge of the Madras High Court Justice K Chandru said the court has no business to ask the motive of the petition, it only needs the identity. He said the registrar general is a statutory post and the person holding the office is the principal executive officer. “It cannot be a secret appointment,” he said. 
There were several attempts to derail the Act since beginning, the former judge said. “First it was the former CJI K G Balakrishnan who sought exemption from the act. Then there were attempts to appoint only judges in the information commission. Now, the Madras HC order is making the entire act unworkable by seeking the reason for filing an RTI petition,” Justice Chandru said.

Rebels keep Chavan on his toes inKaradWith Chavan (right) deciding to contest from his hometown, Undalkar has now declared his intention to contest the seat even if he does not get the party ticket.
Written by Ajay Khape | Mumbai | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:58 am
Stiff contest from party rebels Vilas Patil Undalkar and Atul Bhosale in Karad South Assembly seat has kept Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan on his toes forcing him to make a trip to the constituency every week.
Karad South has been a Congress stronghold with sitting legislator Undalkar getting elected seven times from the seat. With Chavan deciding to contest from his hometown,  Undalkar has now declared his intention to contest the seat even if he does not get the party ticket.  “I have nurtured the seat for so long. People have been expressing confidence in me and they will not make me suffer,” he said reiterating that he will not give into any pressure.
The BJP, meanwhile, is also keeping a close watch. In addition to Undalkar, the party has set its eyes on Atul Bhosale, who had contested Karad North on NCP ticket. Bhosale’s family has been traditionally with the Congress and he too was hoping for the party ticket from Karad South. He has announced his decision to contest.
At a series of meetings Thursday, Chavan told party workers, “My clean image and good work for the state and Karad would see me through to the Assembly,” avoiding any comments on the dissidents.

35 yrs on  CBI to probe how murder convict served only 11monthsPrint
Written by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:56 am
Thirty five years ago, a murder convict sentenced to life imprisonment had walked out of a jail in Uttar Pradesh after spending only 11 months behind the bars and allegedly did not return to serve the remaining prison term.
Krishna Deo Tiwari, now around 70-year-old, was released by the Basti district jail authorities on January 9, 1979, despite no such order from the court or the government.
To solve this mystery, the Supreme Court has now ordered a CBI probe into the release of Tiwari from the prison.
“The facts of the case at hand prima facie suggest that there is a deep-rooted malaise prevalent in the state of UP. No other inference can be drawn if a convict committed to jail can secure his release from custody in the manner noticed in the present case. It is unfortunate that agencies that are charged with the duty of upholding the rule of law are themselves involved in this kind of a racket,” said a bench of Justices T S Thakur and R Banumathi.
The apex court rejected Tiwari’s claim that he was released on parole and that he returned to serve the life sentence, noting that his release was “shrouded in mystery and unsupported by any record whatsoever”.
It is learnt that Tiwari was released by the jail officials on a “bail bond” without any bail order.
“We have, therefore, no manner of doubt that there is a serious flaw in the entire process leading to the alleged release of the convict in 1979… All these aspect need a thorough investigation,” it added.
The court was hearing a petition by activist Amrit Singh, who had brought to light the manner in which Tiwari was released.
Tiwari had shot dead a man in Basti in March 1978 and was sentenced to life term by a trial court.
The High Court had upheld the punishment in November 1979, but not before Tiwari was released from the prison in January.
There is no document to show that he surrendered later.
“The only way the true facts can be discovered and the involvement of those who may be responsible for the sordid affair exposed and brought to book is to direct an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation,” said the bench, asking the probe agency to file its report in three months.
It also ordered that the CBI officer, heading the probe, “would do well to take custody of the relevant records” from the prison “before the said record is destroyed or tampered with”.

ATS probes terror links in dry fruitsbusinessPrint
Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:54 am
The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) is probing whether the dry fruits business of Adil Dolare, who has been booked for the disappearance of four Kalyan youths, is actually a front for illegal activities.
Dolare has been booked along with four others in connection with the disappearance of Areeb Majeed, Saheem Tanki, Aman Tandel and Fahad Sheikh, who were reportedly sent to Iraq where they joined the ISIS. Of them, Areeb was reported dead last month, while the remaining three were last known to be in Iraq’s Ar-Raqqah, also the headquarters of ISIS.
Besides Dolare, the ATS has booked Afghan nationals Rehmat Daulati and Mohammed Rateb Hussainzade, and Govind Thapa, owner of Raja Hotel in Tilak Chowk, Kalyan, for violating provisions of Foreigners’ Act. Daulati is also Dolare’s business partner. Dolare was grilled by the ATS for several hours on Sunday. “Our investigations have revealed that Dolare has made several trips to Afghanistan in the past, and we are probing whether the dry fruits business is a front for something else,” said an ATS source.
“Dolare signed a declaration saying that the Afghan nationals would be staying in his house, whereas they actually stayed in a hotel. We need to find out why Dolare signed the declaration,” said an officer with Thane ATS.
The ATS has identified Dolare as one of the people who had the financial means to fund the four boys’ Iraq trip. He runs a dry fruits business in Navi Mumbai and stays in the same area as the four boys. Dolare also volunteers at the Kalyan-based Islamic Guidance Centre.
Officials confirmed that they would also be issuing Letter Rogatory and Mutual Legal Agreement Treaty letters in order to get Daulati and Hussainzade to India for further investigation.
“According to inquiries we have made so far, the Afghan nationals do not seem to have met the boys personally. The possibility of Dolare being the link between them cannot be denied,” the source said.
Iftikhar Khan, uncle of Fahad Sheikh, was shocked at the development. “I have known Dolare for a long time and I still find it hard to believe that he could be connected to the disappearance of our children,” he said.
Mohsin Khan, president of Islamic Guidance Centre, said, “I have not been able to reach Dolare today (Sunday). I have been really taken aback after readings reports of him being booked,” he said.
Dolare, in his earlier statements, has claimed, “If investigating agencies are watching me, they are only doing their job. I have nothing to hide.”

Bill Clinton connects the dots of Ebola, Alibaba and Scotland
The former US president says there is a need for effective, organic collaboration among nations, businesses and civil society to tackle challenges

The Ebola crisis, the Alibaba IPO (initial public offering) and the failed Scottish independence vote all fit in to what former US president Bill Clinton said he sees as the defining trend of our time—the need for effective, organic collaboration among nations, businesses and civil society to tackle challenges too complicated for anyone to deal with in isolation.
Clinton said the Scottish vote results should be “extremely reassuring all over Europe”, where people have struggled to reconcile national identity and regional governance. The lesson to Clinton, if not to the 45% of Scots who voted for independence, is clear: “You can have your identity and be part of a larger whole.”
The former US president spoke by phone with several reporters to mark the tenth anniversary of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), which will hold its annual star-studded gathering of political, business, civic leaders this week. In a decade, the CGI has brokered more than 2,800 commitments from people and organizations that address a range of topics from climate change to female education, access to finance, disaster relief and public health. The group estimates that pledges made under its aegis have one way or another improved the lives of 450 million people.
The CGI is part of what Clinton said is a global commingling of philanthropy, government and business. “We’re midway through what I figure is a 50-year struggle to define the terms of our interdependence,” he said.
He later added, “Inclusive decision-making is the order of the day.”
Jack Ma , founder of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd , the e-commerce giant that went public on Friday in a $21.8 billion IPO, has the resources and standing to infuse Chinese philanthropy with new momentum, Clinton said. China has approximately 250,000 registered NGOs (non-governmental organizations), including some advocacy groups that the government hasn’t shown the same welcome and friendship that their Indian peers receive.
“Jack Ma has the chance to totally change the landscape now,” Clinton said. Ma not only has money to invest in NGO and philanthropic work in China, but the credibility to elevate discussion of important environmental and social issues, he said.
“This is an incredibly important moment in China,” Clinton said.
Ma and Clinton have spoken on several occasions, most recently on a Clinton trip to Asia to check up on his philanthropic foundation. Previously, Ma has flown his management team to Clinton’s office in Harlem to better understand how the global-scale philanthropy works. “He’s been thinking about this for years,” Clinton said of Ma.
Clinton says he hopes that Ma is able to leverage Alibaba’s success to improve infrastructure for Chinese philanthropy. “They have 300 million people a week doing business on Alibaba,” Clinton said. “The chances of his being able to change China for the better are quite high.”
National and multilateral efforts to contain the Ebola virus in Western Africa have stepped up with US funding and military support, help from the French and British governments, and private sources, like the Gates and Soros foundations, opening their coffers. “Doctors Without Borders has been heroic—maybe their greatest performance ever,” Clinton said. “They’ve been brave and they’ve been effective.”
How is he feeling about efforts to contain the Ebola virus? “I can give you a much better answer today than I could have 10 days ago,” he said. “I feel much better about it now.”
The Ebola crisis has revealed that the World Health Organization (WHO) needs to be better funded for crises, Clinton said. Governments have more and more dedicated money to initiatives with proven track records of success. “I sympathize with that but if you don’t give them any overall money that can be set aside for emergencies, then they don’t have the resources to move in quickly,” to coordinate and channel resources, Clinton said.
Clinton lauded the naming of a United Nations (UN) Ebola coordinator, and welcomed the appointment of locally know officials to help relief and containment efforts. “We’re getting the resources in place and we’re getting the organization in place,” Clinton said. “I do think that we’ve learned something here about the WHO budgeting that we need to correct in the future.”
Clinton said he sees collaboration as the positive creative force in geopolitics, even in areas where its’s been so obviously elusive, as with climate change—where 190-plus nations have met annually for 20 years with little to show for it—or the fight against the Islamic State militant group in Iraq.
“Networks of cooperation will be the dominant modes of success in the 21st century. That’s what I believe,” Clinton said. “And I think all these things that are happening in the world today that are grabbing the headlines are a reflection of what has been a struggle since the end of the Cold War.” Bloomberg

Early in 1901, John Pierpont Morgan dropped by the Manhattan mansion of Andrew Carnegie on 5 West 51st Street to celebrate the biggest commercial deal of that era. At the head of a syndicate of banks, Morgan had just bought out Carnegie’s colossal steel empire for $480m. After a 15-minute conversation, Morgan stood and shook the diminutive industrialist’s hand. “Mr Carnegie, I want to congratulate you on being the richest man in the world!” the famed banker said.

Branching out of the mainstream
Ever since he had started work aged 12 as an immigrant bobbin boy in a Pittsburgh cotton factory, Carnegie had devoted himself with monomaniacal energy to making money. The steel produced by his vast furnaces built America’s railroads and bridges as it emerged as the world’s industrial powerhouse in the late 19th century. But at the age of 65, after much agonising, Carnegie ended his business career and spent the remaining 19 years of his life giving away the bulk of his incredible fortune.
The personal proceeds he received for the sale of his company was equivalent to about 1 per cent of US GDP at the time. In proportionate terms that would make Carnegie richer than America’s two wealthiest men, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, combined today.
As one of America’s “robber barons”, Carnegie was a wildly contradictory man, a ruthless capitalist and a mean-spirited boss who was, in his latter years, astoundingly generous. It is little exaggeration to say he invented modern philanthropy, donating the funds to build 3,000 libraries, install 7,200 musical organs, and endow a host of museums, universities and charitable trusts, as well as Carnegie Hall in New York and the Peace Palace in The Hague. “The man who dies rich, dies disgraced,” Carnegie wrote in an article, entitled “The Gospel of Wealth”.
Yet Carnegie did not stint on himself and his family during his lifetime, acquiring a string of vast homes in the US and abroad. The one closest to his heart was undoubtedly Skibo, a grand estate overlooking the Dornoch Firth in northern Scotland.
The description in the sale particulars, dated 1890, may be one of the few examples where an estate agent did not oversell the property. “It may be doubted whether any estate in the Highlands can rival Skibo in extent and variety of attractions. The beauty of its situation – the salubrity of its climate – with the magnificent modern residence on the site of the ancient seat of the Bishop of Ross – all contribute to the residential value and interest of an estate, with nearly 20,000 acres and over 200 tenants,” it said.
Born in Dunfermline, Carnegie loved nothing better than to return to his homeland for his summer holidays. Having acquired the Skibo estate in 1898, Carnegie invested heavily in turning it into one of the finest private homes of the time, where the likes of Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Asquith, Helen Keller, and Rudyard Kipling flocked to visit.
It was the perfect haven for Carnegie and his wife, Louise, to spend their summers and raise their young daughter, Margaret. Indulging his passions for Dr Golf (as he called it), salmon fishing, and sailing on his yacht, the Seabreeze, Carnegie finally dedicated himself to having some fun. One of his friends said he was like a child with a new toy. “Heaven itself,” Carnegie declared, “is not so beautiful as Skibo.”
Visiting the estate in late summer, it is easy to understand Skibo’s allure. Set in parkland with sweeping lawns and gnarled, fairy-tale trees, the castle rises out of the early morning mists of the Dornoch Firth. Its light-coloured freestone walls reflect an almost ethereal light.
The castle itself, extensively rebuilt by Carnegie, was a seat of luxury. Skibo was the first building in Scotland to install an Otis lift. Electric lights and hot and cold running water were standard in its 20 guest rooms. Its entrance hall contains a striking stained-glass window detailing Skibo’s Viking history and scenes from Carnegie’s life, including the modest cottage in Dunfermline where he was born and the ship that took his family to the US.

Andrew Carnegie at Skibo Castle in 1915
With its grand towers and Gothic battlements, Skibo is suffused with the spirit of Carnegie. Reflecting his patriotic allegiances, a flag with the Stars and Stripes on one side and the Union Jack on the other still flies on the castle’s roof. Tall guests have to stoop to reach the door handles or stare into his bathroom mirror. Carnegie was only 5ft 2in. The library contains one of Carnegie’s favourite aphorisms carved into a wooden book over the fireplace:
“He that cannot reason is a fool,
He that will not is a bigot,
He that dare not is a slave.”
Some of the quixotic traditions Carnegie established at Skibo have been revived by its current owner, the American investor, Ellis Short, who bought the estate for £23m in 2003 and runs it as an exclusive private club for 400 members.
At 8 o’clock every morning, a piper circles the castle summoning any sleepy guests to breakfast. Between 9am and 10am, an organist plays uplifting music on the organ in the entrance hall (Haydn, Bach or Wagner in Carnegie’s time – a more eclectic mix today).
Such was Skibo’s reputation that one afternoon in October 1902, King Edward VII unexpectedly popped in while staying in the neighbourhood. He wanted to examine the latest in luxury as he contemplated the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace. According to the history of Skibo, written by Carnegie’s biographer Joseph Wall, the organist, who had been in the swimming pool, scrambled back just in time to play “God Save the King” as the monarch entered.
The Carnegies’ five-year-old daughter, Margaret, recalled the visit in an interview some 70 years later: “A tall, bearded man was bending over and asking if I would give him a kiss. I never liked to kiss bearded faces [her father, presumably, excepted]. They had sloppy, wet lips, but this face was very different. This man knew how to kiss little girls. I gave the roses to him for the Queen and a rosebud ‘for your ownself’ which he put in his buttonhole.”
Peter Crome, Skibo’s urbane estate manager, has been buying back the furniture, paintings and books that were sold off by subsequent owners. “This is a family home rather than an ancestral castle. There is a sense of well being and calmness,” he says. “Someone told me it was because it was built on two ley lines.”
Two people who remember Skibo well as a family home are Margaret and William Thomson, two of Carnegie’s great-grandchildren who spent their school holidays at the castle and still live nearby. After their mother died tragically early in 1947, the pair – and a menagerie of animals – stayed regularly with “Grandma ‘Negie’”, Carnegie’s daughter, who had inherited Skibo.
Margaret, whose piercing blue eyes recall her Carnegie genes, fondly remembers the sailing expeditions to a little island where there was a summer house. “It was a magical place. You could run wild. My love of the outdoors came from our early life here. We learned to swim in the bay out there,” says Margaret, pointing through the library window.
William, who kept a hamster in his great-grandfather’s bathroom, is the honorary president of the Carnegie UK trust, established in 1913 “for the benefit of the masses as they advance”. He says the Scots are split about Carnegie’s legacy, in spite of the largesse he lavished on the country of his birth.
“There is still a strong 1950s socialist view that he was a robber baron, a harsh industrialist who made huge profits. And there is another view that he did a huge amount of good giving all this money away,” he says. “When we were growing up, we kept quiet about him in case we got thumped. But there are many more people who are complimentary about him today.”
In spite of the happy times that Carnegie enjoyed at Skibo, his last summer there was overshadowed by tragedy as all his efforts to promote peace were shattered by the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. He received the news on the day he completed his memoirs. The final chapter recalled a meeting with Kaiser Wilhelm the previous year, when Carnegie had congratulated Germany’s leader on the silver anniversary of his peaceful reign. In a hastily written postscript, Carnegie wrote: “As I read this today, what a change! The world convulsed by war as never before! Men slaying each other like beasts! I dare not relinquish all hope.”
One hundred years ago this week, Carnegie bade farewell to his household staff, who were rapidly being diverted to military work, and headed to Liverpool for the voyage home. The laird of Skibo was never to return.

Money and mission: When investments conflict with...1
The F.B. Heron Foundation is on the cutting edge of a school of thought that proclaims that values and profits can easily coexist. Known as mission-related investing or impact investing, the basic objective is to invest in ways that enhance, not detract, from philanthropic goals.
Despite some high-profile conflicts that have come to light, mission-related investing is not popular. A 2012 survey by US SIF: The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment found less than 1 percent of U.S. foundations pursued some form of sustainable and responsible investing.
There's reluctance, because foundations worry that they will sacrifice returns if they direct their investments to align with their missions.
"These aren't easy discussions within foundations," said Liz Michaels, chief of staff at Aperio Group, a California-based investment management firm that customizes portfolios to align with investor values. "If your job is to perpetuate the foundation for future generations, the question is whether this is going to negatively impact your ability to do so."
But more research is showing that the investment risk of mission alignment is minimal, Michaels said.
Mission-related investing also has received a boost from the so-called divestment movement.
Divestment occurs when institutions remove financial support from select companies to promote certain behavior or policy. The best known divestment occurred in the 1970s and 1980s when retirement funds, mutual funds and other institutions sold off the stocks of companies that did business in South Africa to boycott the country's system of apartheid.
Today a divestment campaign is targeting oil, coal and natural gas companies for extracting fossil fuels that contribute to climate change. A coalition of foundations and individuals, known as Divest-Invest, has pledged to sell investments in fossil fuels and redirect the capital into clean and renewable energy sources.
The Sierra Club Foundation, which provides financial support to environmental organizations, has joined the Divest-Invest campaign. It may surprise some to learn that the Sierra Club Foundation has holdings in fossil fuel companies.
Chuck Collins, who has recruited wealthy individuals to the Divest-Invest campaign, explained that environmental organizations sometimes hold stock in companies that pollute in an attempt to positively influence their behavior.
"They all believed in the engagement strategy," Collins said, "but it's just not worked."
The Sierra Club Foundation said in a statement that it began aligning its investments with its mission four years ago and has removed most of its exposure to fossil fuel companies. It estimates those holdings to be less than 1 percent of its portfolio and plans to divest the remaining amount within the coming months.
Some of the nation's largest foundations have a mission-driven component in their investment portfolios. The MacArthur Foundation, for example, has set aside $300 million, or about 5 percent of its endowment, for impact investments.
Last year, MacArthur invested $10 million in a newly formed real estate investment trust that acquires affordable housing. MacArthur joined Citibank, Morgan Stanley, Prudential Financial and the Ford Foundation as founding investors.
MacArthur's exposure to a payday-lending business would seem to undercut its support for organizations that preserve affordable housing and strengthen low-income communities, said the Heron Foundation's Miller.

automatic exchange of tax information
(India has been at the forefront…)
CAIRNS: Committing to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion, the G20 today decided to put in place a mechanism for automatic exchange of tax information by 2017.
"We endorse the finalised global Common Reporting Standard for automatic exchange of tax information on a reciprocal basis which will provide a step-change in our ability to tackle and deter cross-border tax evasion.
"We will begin exchanging information automatically between each other and with other countries by 2017 or end-2018," said the communique released after the two-day G20 meeting of Finance Ministers and central bank governors.
India has been at the forefront of raising the issues concerning tax avoidance and automatic exchange of information with a view to curbing tax evasion.
India is being represented by Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and Finance Secretary Arvind Mayaram at the summit.
"We support further coordination and collaboration by our tax authorities on their compliance activities on entities and individuals involved in cross-border tax arrangements," it added.
The communique further said that the G20 leaders are strongly committed to a global response to cross-border tax avoidance and evasion so that the tax system supports growth-enhancing fiscal strategies and economic resilience.
It said that action plan to tackle Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) to make sure companies pay their fair share of tax would be finalised in 2015.
"We will continue to take practical steps to assist developing countries preserve and grow their revenue bases and stand ready to help those that wish to participate in automatic information exchange. We are deepening developing country engagement in tackling BEPS issues and ensuring that their concerns are addressed," it added.
The BEPS initiative would ensure that tax is paid where profits are made.
The G20 ministerial meeting will be followed by a summit at Brisbane in November.
The G-20 is a grouping of industrialised and developing countries. Its members are Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, United States and European Union.

March aims to focus attention on climate ch...Massive New York march aims to focus world's eyes on climate change
By Reuters | 21 Sep, 2014, 08.15PM IST
The gathering will include celebrities such as musician Sting, scientists in lab coats, labor groups, 20 marching bands and floats powered by biodiesel vehicles.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: World leaders including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon were set to join farmers, fishermen, children and others in a massive demonstration on Sunday to demand action on climate change.
Organizers are expecting 100,000 to join the People's Climate March in midtown Manhattan ahead of this week's U.N. General Assembly , which brings together 120 world leaders to discuss reducing carbon emissions that threaten the environment.
The New York rally was expected to be the largest on a day of events in 161 countries including the United Kingdom, France Afghanistan and Bulgaria.
The gathering will include celebrities such as musician Sting, scientists in lab coats, labor groups, 20 marching bands and floats powered by biodiesel vehicles or pulled by hand, said Jamie Henn, spokesman for 350.org, which organized the event with more than a dozen other environmental, labor and social justice groups.
"You can't fight climate change sitting on your couch and holding your breath," Henn said.
Organizers said the massive mobilization is aimed at transforming climate change "from an environmental concern to an 'everybody issue.'"
The United Nations on Tuesday is set to host a climate summit where world leaders will continue talks toward a pact 200 nations are working on that would rein in the rising greenhouse gas emissions. Negotiators aim to complete that deal in late 2015.
In London, actress Emma Thompson and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood were among celebrities who took part in a march of thousands of people who processed through central London towards a rally by parliament.
"Politicians are not showing the will. There is not a problem with the science, there is a problem with the political will," said Ben Phillips, campaigns director for Oxfam. "That is why it is so important that people are marching here today."
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is expected to join the marchers, on Sunday unveiled a new plan for the city to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050.
All 3,000 city-owned buildings that use significant amounts of energy would be retrofitted with energy saving heating, cooling and light systems by then, he said, though meeting the commitment will also require significant investments by private landlords.
"Climate change is an existential threat to New Yorkers and our planet. Acting now is nothing short of a moral imperative," de Blasio said.
The 2-mile (3.2-km) route sanctioned by the New York Police Department winds past Times Square , where dozens of giant billboards flash even at midday and attempts at eco-friendly signs - lit by wind power - have been spotty.
Organizers bill the event as the largest gathering focused on climate change since 2009, when tens of thousands of people gathered in Copenhagen in a sometime raucous demonstration that resulted in the detention of 2,000 protesters.

British Raj did more harm than good in Indian subcontinent: UK Supreme Court debateBritish Empire
(Indo-British Heritage…)
LONDON: The British Raj did more harm than good in the Indian subcontinent, this was the conclusion of a historic debate that put the mighty empire on a mock trial at the Supreme Court here.
The Indo-British Heritage Trust organised the debate as the inaugural event to mark the 400th anniversary of formal relations between India and Britain back in 1614.
The motion before the house was, "The Indian sub-continent benefited more than it lost from the experience of British Colonialism".
The team against the motion, eloquently led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and including fellow authors William Dalrymple and Nick Robins, clinched a decisive victory.
"No wonder the sun never set on the British Empire, even God couldn't trust the English in the dark," said Tharoor as part of his arguments which focused on the economic ruin of India at the hands of the East India Company.
"The might of Britain was built in the 18th and 19th centuries on the ruination of India - where India went from a 23 per cent share of the global economy to 4 per cent," he added.
Dalrymple, author of 'White Mughals' and 'The Last Mughal', echoed the sentiment from the perspective of a prospering Mughal Empire which 'haemorrhaged' under the British.
"It is impossible even to consider this motion seriously without noting how far behind the West was for 90 per cent of our history...the British went to India to get a bit of action in the Mughal Empire which was then immeasurably richer than anything London, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Milan put together...Britain, with its mastery of cannon and artillery, drained India and the money came to Europe," he said.
The debate, which coincided with the Scottish referendum vote on Thursday, was chaired by senior Indian-origin MP and chair of the House of Commons' Home Affairs Select Committee Keith Vaz, who deftly managed proceedings for and against.
Speakers for the motion included arts editor of 'Newsweek' Pakistan Nelofar Bakhtyar, former British politician and BBC war correspondent Martin Bell, and Kwasi Kwarteng, Conservative Party MP and author.
Their side failed to win over the audience with their arguments in favour of the English language, rule of law, railways and cricket as positive legacy of the Empire.
"The fact that we seized upon the English language for our own liberation is to our credit and not by British design," countered Tharoor, who ended on a lighter note saying, "Cricket was an Indian game accidentally discovered by the British".
The debate is the first in a series of events to be organised by Project 400, an initiative by the Indo-British Heritage Trust, founded by historian Kusoom Vadgama.
It was 400 years ago in 1614 that King James I dispatched Sir Thomas Roe as ambassador to the court of Mughal Emperor Jahangir to arrange for a commercial treaty and obtain security assurances on behalf of the East India Company.
In the same year, the first Indian man set foot in Britain - an unnamed worker from Surat who was brought over in an East India Company vessel by a company chaplain and christened "Peter" by King James I.
Vadgama launched Project 400 alongside her co-chair Michael Blacker to mark this official start of the India-UK relationship 400 years ago.
"Project 400 is a monument to the 400-year-old Indo-British relationship. It is also an opportunity to put on record the much neglected history of India in Britain to the same level of detail as that of the history of the British in India," she said.
 
"No history of the British Empire is complete without the history of its people. I never thought that one day I will put the mighty Empire on trial of all places in the Supreme Court," she said.

A Mumbai pattern: Laxity for real estate beforeelectionThe Prithviraj Chavan government in Maharashtra has been busily allotting more floor space index (FSI) to real estate projects.
Written by Shalini Nair | Mumbai | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:28 am
In the run-up to the elections, the Prithviraj Chavan government in Maharashtra has been busily allotting more floor space index (FSI) to real estate projects.
The Urban Development Department accounted for the second highest number of files cleared by the Chief Minister’s Office across 49 departments between June and September this year. A total of 266 files concerning the department, which mainly deals with land-use and FSI policies, were cleared by Chavan.
FSI is the ratio of built-up area to plot size, and a higher FSI is desired by all in land-starved Mumbai where per square foot price for a house can go over a lakh.
Questioning such “haste” from a CM criticised more for studying files for too long before taking any decision, BJP Mumbai unit president Ashish Shelar said: “This is clearly a way to generate party funds by favouring particular developers. We will file a PIL and, if our government comes to power, we will review these decisions.”
Chavan though is just following a trend. An analysis of FSI increase policies by previous chief ministers of the Congress-NCP combine over the past 10 years shows that almost all major policies allotting more FSI to the realty sector were cleared on the eve of elections, always on a “case-to-case” basis.
Chavan’s office said that all policy decisions regarding FSI were taken after following due procedure. “In each case adequate time was given to invite suggestions and objections from the public. The preliminary notification for each policy was issued. Most of the policy decisions about FSI were taken six months ago, and in some cases two-and-a-half years ago. In some cases FSI was granted less than the UDD’s proposal,” said a response from the CMO.
Over the past month, Chavan has cleared hike in FSI for private redevelopment of slums along Mumbai’s airport land, for all proposed commercial buildings in the notified airport area, for construction of exhibition and convention centres, and for redevelopment of old buildings in Navi Mumbai and slums in Thane. He has also tweaked rules to allow more incentives for developers taking up cluster redevelopment schemes in South Mumbai and stripped off the heritage tag from much of Chembur,  paving the way for construction of more high-rises.
Chavan has also sanctioned changes in inclusive housing norms so as to exempt almost all Mumbai-based developers from the mandatory provision of reserving a percent of their projects for those from economically weaker sections and low-income groups.
In late August 2014, Chavan had sanctioned the conversion of a prime 2.88 lakh-sq-m salt pan land in Wadala from No Development Zone to Residential Zone. In recent months, he also gave his nod to scaling up the already high FSI for real estate projects that have a public parking lot continued…

Ex-MP joins BJP ahead of KandhamalbyelectionPrint
Express News Service | Bhubneshwar | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:24 am
In a bid to put up a tough challenge to the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the BJP in Orissa Sunday admitted former BJD MP from Kandhamal Rudramadhab Ray to the party fold ahead of the bypoll to the Kandhamal parliamentary seat next month.
Ray joined the party in the presence of state BJP president K V Singhdeo, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, party in-charge for Orissa Arun Singh and several other senior leaders of the saffron party.
Ray, 76, BJD MP from Kandhamal between 2009 and 2014, was denied party ticket in this year’s election and was later suspended after he campaigned against party candidates.
The BJP has some support in at least three Assembly constituencies of Kandhamal parliamentary seat. The bypoll in Kandhamal was necessitated after the demise of BJD MP Hemendra Singh on September 5 in Bhubaneswar. Kandhamal would go to polls on October 15.
BJP sources said Ray would be a formidable candidate as he has a good support in Daspalla Assembly constituency of the Kandhamal Lok Sabha seat. Senior BJP leader Bijoy Mohapatra would head the party’s campaign committee for the bypoll.
The BJD is expected to nominate Rajeshwari Singh, the wife of Hemendra Singh, as party candidate to cash in on the sympathy wave.
The Congress is yet to declare anyone’s name.

MP BJP chief backs ID check at garbavenuesPrint
Written by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:20 am
Madhya Pradesh BJP chief Nandkumar Chouhan on Sunday justified the demand to make identity cards compulsory before allowing men to enter garba venues, saying it was necessary to neutralise threats posed by organisations like Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).
“Such measures are necessary to keep out SIMI, anti-social and goonda elements. We know what SIMI members do in crowded places like railway stations and bus stands,’’ Chouhan told The Indian Express.
The Lok Sabha MP from Khandwa distanced himself and the party from statements by party MLAs like Usha Thakur (Indore) and Rameshwar Sharma (Huzur), who have said Muslim men should be denied entry to such functions and allowed only if they are accompanied by female family members.
When asked if everyone will need to carry identity cards, the state BJP chief said garba organisers will allow familiar and prominent people, but insist on identity proofs when it comes to unfamiliar faces.
Ruling out disciplinary action against Thakur and Sharma, the state party chief said their comments did not reflect the party’s stand. “Whatever Thakur said was in a different capacity and in a different perspective because she herself organises big religious events,’’ he said, adding that organisers are free to take decisions. After Thakur’s statements, the officials in Ujjain and Indore have instructed garba organisers to ensure that men are allowed entry only after checking their photo identity cards. The administration said the instructions were dictated by concern over law and order and were not meant for any particular community or religion.

UK parties squabble over fall-out from Scott...But while Cameron has tied this to more autonomy for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, opposition leader Ed Miliband says issues are separate.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: Britain's main parties squabbled on Sunday over how to deliver reform after Scotland voted "No" to independence, after Prime Minister David Cameron insisted any new powers for the Scots must see similar autonomy for the English.
The united front of the referendum campaign, when the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats promised greater devolution for Scots if they stayed in the United Kingdom, is cracking over concerns of the wider implications.
All three parties insist they are still committed to extending the devolved Scottish Parliament's control over tax, spending and welfare.
But while Conservative leader Cameron has tied this to more autonomy for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband says the issues are separate and should not be rushed through together.
Much is at stake - although any reforms would not be in place by the May general election, they could have a major impact on the parties' ability to win power.
In Thursday's historic referendum, Scots voted by 55 percent to 45 percent to stay in the United Kingdom.
But a poll two weeks earlier had put the pro-independence camp ahead, prompting a last-minute pledge by Cameron, Miliband and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg to draw up new Scottish powers by January.
Within hours of the result on Friday, Cameron made the surprise announcement that any reform must also include England - something he had not discussed with the others.
Writing in The Mail on Sunday newspaper, the prime minister said there was a "basic unfairness at the heart of our democracy" which had to be addressed.
Scottish lawmakers in the 650-seat British parliament at Westminster are currently allowed to vote on legislation affecting only England, but English MPs have no say in devolved matters decided in Edinburgh.
"Why should Scottish MPs be able to vote on what is taught in English schools, to reduce spending on English hospitals, or even vary English or Welsh income taxes, when under the new settlement English or Welsh MPs would have no say in such matters in Scotland?" Cameron wrote.
"It is fundamentally unjust to have the views of the people of England and Wales overridden in this way."
The prime minister will gather senior Tories at his country retreat on Monday to discuss the plans for reform, with the first debate in parliament due next month.
The implications of Cameron's pledge could see Scottish MPs excluded from certain votes that affect only England, or even the creation of a separate English chamber.
So-called "English votes for English laws" appeal to Conservatives, whose power is concentrated in England, where they won 298 of their 307 MPs in 2010.
By contrast, Scotland delivered 41 of Labour's 258 MPs at the last general election, and excluding them could have a major impact on the party's ability to pass legislation in government.
Miliband said on Sunday that he would deliver on the promises of new power for Scotland, but said he had never agreed to make this conditional on new powers for England.
"I'm open to the idea of greater scrutiny of legislation by English MPs," the Labour leader told BBC television, but stopped short of pledging a change in how MPs vote.
He warned there must be no rush to implement major constitutional changes, saying: "We can't do it on a back-of-the-envelope way.
"We spent two years trying to keep our country together - let's have a proper constitutional convention, let's look at these issues."
Clegg, who as head of the junior coalition partners is also deputy prime minister, warned the political wrangling threatened hopes for radical change.

Two Indian-origin recruiters working for ISIS  al-Qaeda:OfficialsPrint
Written by Johnson T A | Bangalore | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:37 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 9:29 am
Inestigations in Jaipur and Hyderabad into recent attempts by global jihadi outfits to recruit Indian youths has revealed the presence of at least two Indian -origin recruiters on the Internet luring youths on behalf of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS or IS) and al-Qaeda, and working in collaboration with each other.
Former Bhatkal native Abdul Khader Sultan Armar, 38, who is believed to be currently based on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and associated with the Ansar ul-Tawhid ul-Hind has emerged as a common al-Qaeda-linked recruiter in both the Jaipur and Hyderabad investigations.
Besides, a former SIMI man from Karnataka currently said to be based in the Gulf region has been identified as a recruiter for the ISIS and as the one who recently attempted to recruit four Hyderabad youths via the Internet. Sources said he has been found to be in touch online with several youths from India.
The discovery of the two Indian-origin recruiters was confirmed by sources in multiple agencies involved in tracking terrorism. It was Armar who recently made a call to Indians to join global jihad in an Ansar ul-Tawhid online video. Armar is wanted in India and has an Interpol Red Corner Notice against his name in connection with a grand terrorism conspiracy case booked against him and other members of the Indian Mujahideen outfit by the National Investigation Agency.
However, the alleged IS recruiter has not been named in any recent case in India. His name had featured in investigations into activities of the banned SIMI in Karnataka in 2007, but he had not been booked, sources said.
“The emergence of a former SIMI-linked man from Karnataka in the Hyderabad probe into recruitments for the IS is a concern. It is being examined,” a senior Karnataka Police official said.
In the Hyderabad case, the four youths, all engineering students in their early 20s, were detained in West Bengal allegedly in the process of leaving India to join the ISIS.
The Jaipur case involved three youths — Mohammed Mahruf, 21, Mohammed Waqar Azhar alias Haneef, 21, both engineering students and residents of Jaipur, and Shaquib Ansari alias Khalid, 25, a DTP business operator and a resident of Jodhpur — who were arrested on March 23 for alleged terror links.
Investigations following the arrest of the three revealed that they were allegedly lured into taking up jihad by Sultan Armar, who first established contact with them on Facebook via a fake identity, before drawing them into password-protected forums for further discussions including video chat.
The three Rajasthan youths were reportedly then put in touch with alleged Indian Mujahideen operative Tehseen Akhtar alias Monu. It was Akhtar’s arrest that led investigating agencies to them.
Investigators allege that the four Hyderabad youths were initially handled online by the Karnataka-origin ex-SIMI man based in the Gulf.
According to officials, six youths from Hyderabad were first contacted online and “brainwashed” continued…

By November  a Rajdhani toArunachalPrint
Written by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:53 am
The Indian Railways is set to kick off the Rajdhani Express between Arunachal Pradesh and New Delhi by November. To make travel more passenger-friendly, Arunachal has agreed to relax the rigid norm of inner-line permit, which is otherwise mandatory for “outsiders” entering the state.
After a series of meetings at the Prime Minister’s Office between Railways and state officials, as well as correspondence between the state’s Chief Secretary and the Railway Board recently, it was decided that passengers who have made a reservation will not require the permit.
The Railways had reasoned that details of the identity of a passenger with a reserved ticket are entered into the railway system at the time of booking, and are verified when they board.
“The state has agreed that as long as a passenger holds a reserved ticket, inner-line permit is not required,” Devi Prasad Pande, Member-Traffic, Railway Board, told The Indian Express. The Rajdhani Express to Naharlagun, 15 km from the state capital of Arunachal Pradesh, will run twice a week to and from Delhi. Another AC-only express train linking Guwahati to the Capital is also on the cards. In both categories of trains, unreserved tickets are not issued.
The problem of running trains with general class coaches, in which passengers can travel with unreserved tickets, is still being discussed.
The two sides have discussed the possibility of creating a ‘holding area’, where credentials of passengers with unreserved tickets can be verified and state officials can issue inner-line permits to them .
Ever since the 33-km railway line between Harmuti in Assam and Naharlagun   — the last stage in the Rajdhani project which will connect Arunachal with the rest of the country  — neared completion earlier this year, local groups have stepped up protests against the prospect of outsiders inundating the state.
“How does a reserved ticket meet the requirements of the inner-line permit? The permit system was introduced as per a law which still exists to protect locals from exploitation. What is the problem in procuring a permit before boarding the train? I don’t think the new arrangement will be acceptable,” said Ninong Ering, Congress MP from Arunachal East Lok Sabha constituency.
Ering was referring to The Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873 and the Chin Hill Regulations, 1896, which are meant to provide special protection and safeguard the “peaceful existence of the indigenous tribal people” in Arunachal.

UPA officials underline: Chidambaram approval was as pernormsPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:46 am
The defence being presented by key officials who handled the file relating to Maxis subsidiary’s investment in Aircel Ltd in 2006 is that the rules at the time considered the face value of equity and not the total investment inflow in deciding the ‘competent authority’ for approving the proposal.
According to a former member in the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), the face value of investment by Global Communication Services Holdings Ltd in Aircel was less than Rs 300 crore. The total foreign investment, however, stood at Rs 3,560 crore.
“The finance minister was the competent authority for approving investments with face value of up to Rs 600 crore,” Ashok Jha, former secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry, told The Indian Express. Jha had cleared the proposal and put it before Chidambaram then.
Face value is the nominal or original value of a company’s security when it is first issued. The market value of the security increases with time as the company grows and expands its operations. A company can then issue the same shares at a premium to the face value. The inflow then into the company is much higher than the face value.
The CBI is probing the circumstances of the FIPB approval to the Aircel-Maxis deal by Chidambaram, the then finance minister. As reported in The Indian Express, the CBI said the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) was the ‘competent authority’ to approve the $800 million or Rs 3,560 crore total investment.
Officials who cleared the proposal before it reached Chidambaram said that the policy prevalent then specified that the board would look only at the face value and not the total foreign inflow while considering the competent authority. The rules stated that proposals entailing foreign investment with face value up to Rs 600 crore be sent to the finance minister for approval; over Rs 600 crore to the CCEA.
Another official, who had signed the file, said, “The CBI has already been informed of the rules then.” The official added that there were more than two dozen more proposals — with face value less than Rs 600 crore, but with a higher investment inflow — that were placed before the finance minister, and approved by him.
In fact, a list of such proposals has also been submitted to the CBI, a former government functionary who did not wish to be identified said. The rules were changed subsequently in 2010. Former commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma, who was the commerce and industry minister then, confirmed to The Indian Express that in January 2010, the rules were changed so that total foreign investment inflow replaced face value as the criterion to decide the competent authority.

Five hidden bank charges you must knowFive common hidden bank charges
Simplus Information Services –  Tue 9 Sep, 2014 2:15 PM IST
Print
Did you know that banks quietly impose charges for many facilities they offer? Account holders are pinched with unexpected costs at the end of the month. One can easily avoid many these charges and save money, if only we’d know what they’re for.
Here’s a list of 5 most common hidden charges you may already be paying without even realizing:  
1) Average monthly balance charges
All private banks in India ask account holders to maintain a minimum balance. If during a particular month, you overdraw money beyond this limit, banks charge a penalty of up to Rs. 250 per month. If for some reason, it is not possible to maintain a minimum balance, you can open an account with a public sector bank for many of them don’t have any minimum balance condition.
2) Bank visit charges
Do you keep count of monthly visits to your bank branch? If not, you should start now. Private banks charge a service fee for every visit beyond a specified limit. Many people are not aware of this, but those who make frequent deposits and withdrawals directly from banks should know.If the number of cash deposits and withdrawals from a branch is high, then the bank charges a cost for using services of additional staff (like cashier), tackling fake currency and paying for extra security. You can avoid paying this extra cost by limiting your visits to a bank. Try using an ATM for cash withdrawal instead of visiting your bank branch.
For deposits and cheque payments, make use of direct fund transfers via online banking.   
3) ATM charges
Did you know that using an ATM also costs? You don’t pay anything for using your bank ATM, but are definitely charged for using other bank ATMs.
Usually, the first five transactions at other bank ATMs are free. On your sixth visit, the bank can charge up to Rs. 20 per transaction. The charges vary from bank to bank, but don’t exceed Rs. 20. Many banks also charge for replacement of a lost ATM card or regeneration of the PIN (Personal Identification Number).
4) National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) charges
Transferring funds to any bank account in India over the internet is surely very convenient, but not without a price. Different banks can charge anywhere between Rs. 5 and Rs 25 per transaction. Although the charges are not very high, if money is frequently transferred, the cumulative amount at the end of the year could be huge. Using a cheque saves this cost.
5) Cheque transaction charges
As such, issuing and receiving cheque payments does not cost anything. But all is not as simple as it appears. If a cheque is returned without being paid, it carries a penalty. In case of intercity payment via cheque, a bank has to bear additional costs of clearing, which it draws out from the customer’s account. Asking a bank to withhold cheque payments also carries charges. For instance, Axis bank charges Rs. 100 every time you ask for holding a cheque payment. Requesting cheque books beyond an allowed quota too has a price. Banks usually charge customers Rs. 2 per cheque. This means, if you ask for a booklet with 50 cheques, it costs Rs. 100.
One can easily spare oneself from paying the numerous bank charges by simply being a little alert about the money deducted for banking services in the account. One can monitor ones account through online banking and always question the bank about any unfair charges levied for any services provided.

Have road map to channelise talent  says PM NarendraModiWe have fallen from where we were before. But now we have a chance to rise again, says Narendra Modi.
New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 2:29 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that India is not in the race to become the next China in terms of growth. Instead, the Prime Minister says he believes that both the countries are growing rapidly and the current era belongs to them. Modi, who will visit the United States next week, said he was confident that India and US would be able to develop a genuine strategic alliance as there were a lot in common between the two societies — Americans have absorbed people from across the world and Indians are present in every part of the world — as they are bound by history and culture and the ties would deepen further.
In an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Modi said that he has full faith in the unlimited entrepreneurial talent and capabilities of 1.25-billion Indians and has a clear road map to channel it. “It is my absolute belief that Indians have unlimited talent. I have no doubt about our capabilities. I have a lot of faith in the entrepreneurial nature of our 1.25-billion people. There is a lot of capability. And I have a clear road map to channelise it,” he said when asked whether India can match the kind of 8-9% growth rates China has achieved consistently for 30 years while India has done for only a short period of time.
On whether India would be the next China in terms of growth and transform the world, Modi said: “India does not need to become anything else. India must become only India. This is a country which once upon a time was called ‘the golden bird’. We have fallen from where we were before. But now we have a chance to rise again. If you see the details of the last five or ten centuries, you will see that India and China have grown at similar paces. Their contributions to global GDP have risen in parallel, and fallen in parallel. Today’s era once again belongs to Asia. India and China are both growing rapidly, together”.
Modi also dismissed the oft-repeated hypothesis that China’s growth has been faster because it has authoritarian government while being a democracy India has its constraints. “If China is one example, then democratic countries provide another example. They have also grown fast. You can’t say that growth is not possible because of democracy. Democracy is our commitment. It is our great legacy, a legacy we simply cannot compromise. Democracy is in our DNA,” Modi said.
On whether he wished he also had some power and authority like that of the Chinese government, Modi responded in the negative by stating that he’s seen the strength of democracy. “If there were no democracy, then someone continued…

stumble
LAS VEGAS (AP) — A hotel room suicide of a man who was freed from jail after being accused of intentionally crashing his vehicle into the Stratosphere and declaring he wanted to jump from its tower raised questions Thursday about why he hadn't been charged with a crime and whether he was properly screened for mental illness.
Answers weren't immediately apparent.
Ryan C. Brown asphyxiated before he was found hanging Tuesday in a room at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino, the Clark County coroner said.
That was a day after a Las Vegas judge ordered the 40-year-old Brown freed with no restrictions because prosecutors hadn't filed criminal charges in the Sept. 10 crash at the Stratosphere hotel-casino, and didn't seek more time to do so. Brown was told to return to court Oct. 15.
"The real question is why the district attorney didn't charge him," said Daren Richards, assistant Clark County public defender.
Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson was in meetings Thursday and unavailable for immediate comment, said Tess Driver, his executive assistant.
Richards, a veteran administrator in an office representing indigent defendants, said arrestees are usually screened during jail intake for suicidal thoughts and mental health issues. In some cases, judges are notified if more evaluation is needed.
In extreme cases, police or jailers can order a "Legal 2000" mental health evaluation by a doctor, said Officer Larry Hadfield, a Las Vegas police spokesman. That process can take up to 72 hours.
But "people can't be held without cause," Hadfield said. "It's not against the law to be mentally ill."
Hadfield said he had no information about Brown's case.
Brown hadn't been assigned a lawyer because he hadn't been charged with a crime, and Richards said it wasn't clear from the court record if Brown underwent jail psychological screening.
However, it seemed evident from a police report that crimes could have been alleged.
No one was hurt in the crash, but investigators said it appeared to have been a deliberate act.
Brown drove on a sidewalk past pedestrians before accelerating his Ford F-150 pickup through the valet area and crashing through the front glass doors, police said. The truck came to rest near the hotel bell desk, wedged between railings of a four-step casino entry stairway in a shower of broken glass.
Brown tried to run and struggled with security guards before police arrived and arrested him on felony cocaine possession and misdemeanor driving under the influence and reckless driving charges.
Police reported finding more than 1 gram of crack in the vehicle ashtray, and said Brown admitted using drugs for six days and smoking crack cocaine two hours before the crash.
Brown told officers he had wanted to jump off the Stratosphere and that he was excited to be making news, according to the police report. He said he had the same birthday as Elvis Presley, worked as an electrician at the Burning Man counterculture festival in northern Nevada, and had being fired after a domestic dispute with his wife. Her name and his hometown weren't provided.
He told police he was born in Indiana.
Brown later became combative with jailers, who restrained him with a cover over his face to prevent him from spitting at others, the police report said.

Canada s Shale Boom: More to Come in Montneyreddit
In the world of a constantly changing oil and gas environment, the Montney shale basin is the sleeping giant that holds the key to accelerating Canada's shale oil and gas boom, but the real treasure within this giant is a tight liquids-rich zone (approximately 15-20 miles wide) that has big and small players alike narrowing their focus for the potential of a giant payout.
A pervasive hydrocarbon system in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) in Alberta and British Columbia, the Montney is estimated to hold 2,200 trillion cubic feet of gas, almost 29 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and over 136 billion barrels of oil. But it is the tight liquids rich fairway (approximately 15-20 miles wide) that contains high concentrations of both free condensate and natural gas liquids that everyone is pursuing in what may very soon be one of the largest commercially viable plays in the world.
Investors aren't exactly shying away from the challenge, and the overall trend within this large basin is a shift towards liquids-rich areas , which is what the Middle Montney (the middle portion of the Montney resource) is all about.
Initially, companies targeted the Upper Montney, and the entire formation was viewed more as a dry gas play with high productivity and immense gas in place. Through the technological advances that have begun to move up to Canada and a general de-risking of the play, the Middle Montney is proving that there is a very large liquids-rich fairway available with a potential for incredible returns and economics.
Canadian supermajor Encana (NYSE:ECA)--a Montney shale heavyweight--is focusing its drilling to the east of the formation. Last year, Encana announced it would spend over 25 percent of its capex for 2014 on the Montney, and the liquids-rich plays in the eastern area will get the lion's share of this, with 80-85 new wells planned for this year alone.
There are also a number of growing mid-cap players and one micro-cap honing in on this liquids-rich scene and benefitting from supermajor drilling, including mid-cap NuVista (NVA.TO) and micro-cap Blackbird Energy (BBI.V).
Related: Can New Technology Help The Oil Sands Industry Clean Up Its Act?
Earlier this month, NuVista signed a deal to purchase another 12.5 gross sections of undeveloped land in the Montney's liquids-rich zone, which puts its total at over 220 gross sections, while Blackbird has 117 sections of multi-zone Montney rights--again, with a focus on the liquids-rich zone.
It's a very fast-paced game of follow the leader.
When Encana drilled a well in a previously unproven Middle Montney area and came up with two very economic middle Montney wells that both had condensate gas ratios of approximately 100 barrels of oil per million feet of gas, Navistar responded by immediately buying up land in the vicinity, driving prices up over $2.9 million per section. Blackbird followed suit, capturing a 36-section land position right between Shell and Encana and next to NuVista, which drilled a well with 2,195 boe/d.
And while there is still land available here, prices are rising fast, which makes the situation interesting for the small player like Blackbird Energy, which finds that its land value alone is higher than its current market cap.
Explorers and producers are surrounding the Middle Montney in a pincer movement, and liquids-rich sweet spots are shaping up to be the key to unlocking this next North American treasure chest. And the end of the day, the amount of shale gas under Montney's surface would be enough to supply Canada's needs for 145 years, making it one of the top basins in the world , outdone only by Qatar.

3. I need to make some of my own choices, and maybe some of my own mistakes. Don't do my work for me or get me out of every jam. You don't need to be better than me at everything. Don't condescend; you don't need to impart your elderly wisdom on me if I have a problem. Please wait for me to ask for your help. If I don't ask for it, I might want to work it out for myself. Let me rant without offering advice. Sometimes that's all I really need, just to talk my way through something and for you to just listen to me.
4. Sometimes I'm going to be moody and annoyed and frustrated. You need to just let that happen (though you shouldn't let me be rude to you; that's weird and embarrassing). It might just be a mood or something might be going on that I'm not ready to talk about yet. If you hang around doing stuff near me and don't interrupt or try to solve it as soon as I start, I might feel comfortable talking with you about things.
5. Trust that I'll do my work. If I don't, you can help me manage my time, but wait until I'm not taking care of responsibilities to think I can't. Don't just assume I can't handle responsibility because of my age. Believe in me.
6. It feels really good when you ask me to teach you about what I'm learning or what I'm good at. You don't have to be awesome at computer programming to let me teach you some cool stuff, for instance. I have to be a beginner constantly. Show me it's OK to stay relaxed and present when you are struggling to learn something.
7. I don't like the drama either, and it surprises me as much as it does you. You think it's rough having this alien lunatic in your house? Try having it in your body, and you can't even get away.
8. If you don't like my friends, it feels like you don't trust my judgment or like I am stupid about choosing friends. Or both. Ask me what I like about them, or what we have fun doing together, or just to tell you about a new friend. Stay open-minded. Still, if you think my friends are being bad to me, I need you on my side that much more.
9. Sometimes I am completely overwhelmed and need to zone out for a while. I am not becoming a slug and will not stay in my room staring at a screen for the rest of my life. Maybe just for the rest of the afternoon.
10. I will fight you every step of the way if you make me do stuff I don't want to do (get some exercise, do my homework, write a thank-you note, practice piano, apologize to my sister, take a shower, wear deodorant... so many things), but you should probably make me do them anyway. I know I will feel better if I sweat and shower each day, and develop my study skills, and show up tomorrow prepared, and, and, and. I know! But please don't overwhelm me. I might not be able to do what I should right away. I might need reminders, later, which will annoy me completely. Remind me anyway.
11. Explain why I'm being criticized or punished. It feels scary if I don't understand anything beyond that you are mad at me. And sometimes what I need more than a scolding is a hug or a cuddle. Especially when I am more porcupine than puppy.
12. I need to have private jokes with my friends and not explain them to you. It's how we bond. You don't need to be involved in every aspect of my life to still be loved and needed by me.
13. If my social life gets to be too much, I may need you to force a little vacation from it on me. But most of time what I need is to work through how to navigate life online and with peers. Now is my chance to learn how to deal, with your help. Just shutting it down keeps me from learning how to build my life online with scaffolding provided by you. Stay calm and cool, let me explain what's going on, and talk things through with me. Ask more, tell less.
14. Especially if I've been feeling stressed, maybe you could just hang out with me. Go to the park or get an ice cream or have a catch, whatever; it feels good to just do something together without discussing or solving or teaching anything.
15. I like it when you think I'm funny. Or interesting. Or awesome. I actually do care what you think about me. Please find something specific you actually like about me because sometimes I can't find anything in myself to like at all. I might roll my eyes, but your words and judgments do matter to me, and I will remember them, the good and the bad. I will keep them with me like treasures even when I lose my keys and wallet and ID. Which I probably will. More than once. Sorry.
And bonus extra important thing you should know: The fact that my opinions on this and anything else might change tomorrow does not mean I don't feel them fiercely today. Keep up. I love you. Remind me you still love me, too.

The Video That Proves The Referendum Result Was Definitely [NOT] RiggedScottish Referendum Video Provokes Claims From Cybernats That Vote Was Rigged
The Huffington Post UK  | By Charlotte Meredith
reddit
Scottish nationalists have been told to "get a grip" after complaining that the outcome of the referendum vote was rigged.
After David Cameron this morning said that the debate surrounding independence has now been "settled for a generation... perhaps for a lifetime," angry pro-indy supporters vented their frustrations.
The angry reaction is somewhat unsurprising given the hostile nature of the debate in the final days of the divisive campaign.

Meanwhile, officials at the referendum count in Glasgow are investigating 10 cases of suspected electoral fraud at polling stations after Glasgow City Council said police had been called earlier today.
They said it related to possible cases of impersonation, where people pretend to be someone else, cast the vote, then the real person turned up to vote.
Stewart Hosie, SNP Treasury spokesman at Westminster, said it was "very sad that people feel the need to engage in any kind of impersonation".
He told Sky News: "I think that's a daft thing to do.
"The ballot papers have been identified, they will be taken away and fingerprinted, the police will do their job and I'm sure whoever has done it will be caught and sentenced.
"That's the correct procedure. It won't change the result but of course it shouldn't have happened, it is a silly, silly, thing for anyone to try to do."
Police Scotland said there was an ongoing investigation into a "small number" of ballot papers which had been compromised.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Police Scotland takes the safety and security of the independence referendum extremely seriously and is working with partner agencies including local authorities and the Chief Counting Officer to ensure the integrity of the ballot.
"Any crime committed will be investigated appropriately."

Things Turn Ugly In Massive Glasgow Referendum StandoffRival Scottish Independence Rallies Hit Glasgow As Police Look On
The Huffington Post UK  | By Louise Ridley
reddit
Police are holding back opposing crowds of pro and anti-independence supporters in George Square in Glasgow, amid reports of flag burning and mounting tensions in the city after the Scottish referendum result.
The confrontation follows Alex Salmond 's announcement that he will quit as Scottish first minister after voters rejected Scottish independence .
Glasgow was one of just four local authorities which voted for independence from the UK, while the majority of Scotland - 55% of the population - voted for it to remain in the union.
Police closed the city centre to traffic on Friday evening as they separated the crowds, with some protesters reportedly holding flags and setting off flares .
So now Unionists are burning Scottish flags, doing Nazi salutes. I know they are NOT reps of No campaign but wtf. #GeorgeSquare #indyref
— Haniya Khalid (@Haniya1995) September 19, 2014
An initial pro-union demonstration is reported to have led to a stand-off between hundreds of independence supporters and unionists, with some throwing objects including flares and firecrackers, according to the BBC whose reporter Cameron Buttle was on the ground.
Chanting in George Square in Glasgow
Union supporters waved Union Flags and both sides chanted slogans as they were held apart by two lines of police in high-res jackets. One side reportedly sang the national Scottish song Flower of Scotland, while the other sang Rule Britannia.
A police helicopter has been seen overhead and a police mounted division on horseback is at the side of the demonstration, according to Sky News, which said the police appeared to have the situation "under control" although it was "very tense".
A spokesperson for Police Scotland said: "There has been some minor disorder which was quickly dealt with. No arrests have been made and the square has been closed to traffic."
Some Yes and No supporters online reacted with horror, saying that the demonstrations did not represent the official Yes Scotland or Better Together campaigns.

The leaders of the Scottish Labour and Conservative parties have spoken out in disappointment at the clashes. Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, told the BBC: "We don't want to be seeing scenes like that on our streets."
One tweeter at the scene said it was developing into an "ugly riotous stand off" while another said "Horrible atmosphere building in Glasgow city centre as hardline side of Union 'celebrates'".

We Couldn t Have Designed A Worse Fucking CampaignScottish Independence: 'Lacklustre' Labour Must Learn Lessons From The 'Negative' No Campaign

Labour Party leader Ed Miliband addresses the public and the media as he walks in Edinburgh, Scotland, on September 16, 2014, ahead of the referendum on Scotland's independence. The leaders of the three main British parties on Tuesday issued a joint pledge to give the Scottish parliament more powers if voters reject independence, in a final drive to stop the United Kingdom splitting.

On Monday morning, I bumped into a senior member of the shadow cabinet, who was standing with a pair of aides to Ed Miliband at Euston station, all of them clutching trolley bags. "We're off to save the union," said the shadow minister, with a grin. "And we're not coming back till it's saved."
Well, the 307-year union between England and Scotland is now officially safe, with 55% of Scots voting 'No' to independence in yesterday's referendum. The question of Scottish independence, to quote David Cameron, is now "settled for a generation" .
How about the question of the next election? Is that "settled" too? Judging by the lacklustre Better Together campaign, which was Labour-dominated from the start - from its campaign director Blair McDougall, a former New Labour special adviser, to its chair Alistair Darling, the former chancellor, to its de facto chief strategist Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary - the Opposition have much work to do between now and next May's general election.
Some senior Labour figures aren't happy with the style or substance of the pro-union effort. "The truth of the matter is that we couldn't have designed a worse fucking campaign," a disgruntled member of the shadow cabinet tells me. "It was shocking."
He points to the relentlessly negative tone employed by 'No' campaigners, the lateness of the so-called devo-max offer , the obsessive focus on economics rather than identity, and the failure of Labour campaigners to distance themselves from the "toxic Tories".
Despite the referendum being held in Labour's Scottish heartland - where party founder Keir Hardie was born, where three of the last four Labour leaders were born, and where the Opposition currently holds 41 of the 59 parliamentary seats - there was little sign that the party had a clear grip on it message or its policies.
"Scottish Labour is fucked," says another shadow cabinet minister, who also went up to campaign north of the border. "They've proved they can't organise a piss-up in a brewery."
The shadow minister mocks the idea that "you wait till 10 days before [the vote] to call in Gordon Brown and show some passion".
Much of the credit, on both sides of the border, for the unexpectedly strong anti-independence vote on Thursday has gone to Brown, who energised the 'No' campaign with a series of highly-charged public events in the final few days, culminating in the "speech of a lifetime" from the former prime minister on the eve of the referendum.
Brown, not Miliband, is now credited as the campaigner who saved the union
Brown himself, a master political strategist and veteran campaigner, kept his distance from Better Together and operated, effectively, as a one-man, anti-independence army for much of the campaign. It's believed his decision to offer Scottish voters 'home rule' powers in return for a 'No' vote wasn't coordinated with the prime minister, with the leader of the opposition or with Better Together's Darling, his former cabinet colleague.
"I'm not going anywhere near Better Together," Brown told a friend a few weeks ago. "It's part of the problem. That's why we're not winning."
Brown brought passion, energy and populism to a 'No' campaign dominated by much more dour, dry and uncharismatic figures from Labour. Better Together was fronted by "technocrats", says a senior Labour source, citing the names of, among others, Alexander, Darling and Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont. The party's general election campaign in 2015 can't afford to be, he adds.
Alexander, who doubles up as Labour's election campaign coordinator, was drafted in earlier this year to help with Better Together's campaigning and strategy, and has since been blamed by critics within his party for the late surge from the 'Yes' campaign over the past few weeks. It was Alexander who was blamed for commissioning a two-minute television ad of an undecided Scottish "mother" discussing the referendum which was mocked on social media for being patronising and sexist. Press reports quoted Better Together figures referring to Alexander as “Rain Man”, after the autistic character played by Dustin Hoffman in the Oscar-winning movie, because of his inability to connect with ordinary people.
"Until Douglas became the chief strategist for the 'No' campaign, we were 20 points ahead," a Labour frontbencher and critic of Alexander wryly observes.
Douglas Alexander has been mocked as 'Rain Man' by his critics
Had the Scots voted 'Yes', says the frontbencher, Alexander would have been "finished". "You can only have so much luck," he says, reminding me of how the shadow foreign secretary ran both Labour's (losing) May 2010 general election campaign and David Miliband's (losing) September 2010 Labour leadership campaign.
Others say it is unfair to blame Alexander, as he joined Better Together so late on and, they add, the 'No' side won in the end - and, despite the last-minute jitters, won comfortably, by a 10% margin.
Still, the negativity of the message, the failure to offer an alternative and positive vision to the 'Yes' campaign, the reports of a dysfunctional working environment within Better Together and the inability to hold onto a 20-point lead worry some Labour strategists as they turn their attention back to Westminster and the general election.
"Despite plenty of people, including Gordon Brown, saying you've got to have a positive message, a positive alternative to the 'Yes' campaign, Darling and Alexander wouldn't do it until it was forced on them by Brown himself, from the outside," one of Labour's savviest strategists tells me, as he arrives back in England from Scotland.
And what's with the (belated) reliance on Brown? Was Miliband not up to the task of leading the Labour 'No' campaign? Why couldn't he mobilise Labour voters in Scotland on his own? He can't be blamed for 'Yes' campaigners surrounding and heckling him on campaign stops but he can be blamed for his failure to show direction and vision to anti-independence activists in his own party.
"Ed needs to look in the mirror," says a senior MP who would normally be considered a supporter of the Labour leader, adding that the decision to outsource the campaign's vision and direction to Darling and Alexander was "a catastrophic blunder".
So too was his seeming complacency. Six months ago, says a well-placed Labour source, not a single member of Miliband's team was worried about the Scotland result; they were all convinced that the 'No' campaign was on course for an easy victory. None of them saw the late Salmond 'surge' coming. "Anyone who says otherwise isn't telling the truth," says the source.
"The Labour Party, under Miliband's leadership, has had two years to prepare for this moment and never really did because it never really took [the Scottish referendum] seriously," adds the Labour strategist.
Members of the leader's inner circle push back hard against this narrative. "Ed's been to Scotland 14 times since March," says an ally of the Labour leader. "He also deployed resources from English marginals to the [Better Together] campaign. I don't think there was complacency [on his part] or a failure to see this as a huge challenge."
The Labour leader visited Scotland 14 times as part of the Better Together campaign
Why then was there so little effort from the Labour leadership to engage with the arguments over devolution of power, decentralisation and localism, beyond the Adonis Review's June proposal to divert £30 billion worth of funding to cities and regions? Why was it left to Brown to make the offer (bribe?) of extra 'home rule' powers and funds for Scots only days before the vote? Why were Miliband and his fellow shadow cabinet ministers caught on the hop by Cameron's instant, post-referendum demand for "English votes for English laws" [EVEL] and a "decisive answer" to the so-called West Lothian Question?
This last question is perhaps crucial: if Labour cannot come up with a softer form of EVEL then, as the devolution expert Alan Trench put it to me , "they'll find themselves saddled with a more rigid one to appease the Conservative right" and then even after they win an election, as one commentator put it , they'll be "in office but not in power, handing the Conservatives an effective veto".
"Ed has to pause and reflect on the lessons" of the referendum campaign, says a shadow cabinet ally of Miliband. For a start, he says, "Scotland can't be treated separately."
One of the key lessons of the Scottish referendum result is that the anti-politics mood generated by the Iraq war, the MPs' expenses scandal and the financial crash, among other things, still persists, affects voting intentions and is skilfully exploited by the likes of the SNP in Scotland and Nigel Farage's Ukip in England. The latter pushes a right-wing populist agenda while the former pushes a left-wing one; where's Miliband's own populist agenda?
The Labour strategist warns me that his party is "living on borrowed time. We're losing working-class supporters all the time; in the north to the Scottish nationalists and in the south to Ukip."
Has Miliband's Labour ceded the populist, anti-establishment ground to Farage's Ukip?
"We just look like an establishment party," explains a frustrated frontbencher, who says Miliband's message of change and reform is falling on deaf ears because he isn't matching his radical rhetoric with action. Labour is so keen to look like a serious, responsible, alternative government-in-waiting that it has ceded the populist, anti-establishment ground to the SNP in Scotland, Ukip and the Greens in England and - in Bradford, at least - George Galloway.
"[Scotland] shows there's a huge pent-up desire for change," a friend of Miliband told me earlier this week. "People don't want 'business as usual'. The worst thing any party could do if there's a 'No' vote is go right back to 'business as usual'."
The big question for Labour is: will Miliband heed his advice? With his party conference speech in Manchester only days away, and the general election just eight months away, the Labour leader can't really afford not to.

Give reasons for seeking information under RTI: Madras HChuman rights
In a serious blow to transparency regime in the country, the Madras High Court has said RTI applicants must give reasons for seeking information as it gave relief to its Registry from disclosing file notings on a complaint against a chief metropolitan magistrate.
A division bench comprising justices N. Paul Vasanthakumar and K. Ravichandrababu said an applicant must disclose the object for which information is sought and also satisfy that such object has a legal backing, a decision which may have far reaching implications on getting information under the RTI Act and which was decried by legal experts and activists.
“If informations (sic) are to be furnished to a person, who does not have any reason or object behind seeking such informations, in our considered view, the intention of the Legislature is not to the effect that such informations are to be given like pamphlets to any person unmindful of the object behind seeking such information,” the bench said.
However, the Legislature while passing the RTI Act has specially incorporated Section 6(2) which says an applicant making request for information “shall not” be required to give any reason for requesting the information.
The Madras High Court order does not mention Section 6(2) of the Right to Information Act.
“We should not be mistaken as if we are saying something against the intention of the Legislature. What we want to emphasise is that a Legislation, more particularly, the one on hand, must achieve the object, viz, concrete and effective functioning of the public authority with transparency and accountability by providing the information which are under the control of such public authorities,” it said.
Terming the order “illegal”, senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan said it is against “letter and spirit” of the Act.
“It’s a self-serving order by the High Court in line with a number of earlier orders of High Courts and Supreme Court virtually preventing administrative transparency of the court,” he told PTI.
RTI activist C.J. Karira said the judgement strikes a body blow to the RTI Act since its tantamount to striking down of Sec 6(2) without explicitly stating so.
Noted RTI expert Shekhar Singh also said that the Supreme Court has defined the Right to Information as a fundamental right and to exercise it one need not give any reason.
He said by definition, fundamental right means something which is a right that you have irrespective of any condition.
“There are two problems with the order. It is in violation of the law. RTI specifically asks no reasons need be given for seeking information. Secondly, it is also in violation of earlier rulings of the Supreme Court saying it is fundamental right,” he said.
He said by this order the High Court has overturned earlier apex court rulings because the moment they said one has to give reasons for seeking information his or her fundamental right is being denied.
Similar views were expressed by Venkatesh Nayak, Programme Coordinator, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative who said the order is “complete violation of the RTI Act”.
“The Right to Information is a fundamental right and it is available to every citizen who is born in India. You are not supposed to give reasons for exercising those fundamental rights. The Right to Information is recognised by the Supreme Court as being part of Right to free speech and expression under Article 19 (1)(a) and also a part of Right to Life under Article 21,” Mr. Nayak said.
He said it is a “big surprise” and “travesty of existing jurisprudence” if anybody says that a citizen must prove why he or she wants a particular information which ordinarily a public authority would have made public on its own.

CBI examines Nalini Chidambaram in Saradha scam probeinquiry
Queries posed on her links with Manoranjana Sinh, who introduced her to Saradha Group head, Sudipto Sen.
The CBI on Saturday sought some clarifications from Nalini Chidambaram, the wife of former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, in connection with the Saradha chit fund scam. “The CBI did not question me. The CBI officers wanted to know whether Ms. Manoranjana Sinh [estranged wife of Congress leader Matang Sinh] had consulted me professionally. I told them yes, I was consulted,” said Ms. Chidambaram in a statement to the media.
CBI officials said they approached Ms. Chidambaram in Chennai on Saturday to seek clarifications as she had been the legal advisor to Manoranjana Sinh. Ms. Sinh had purportedly introduced Ms Chidambaram to Saradha Group head Sudipto Sen, now the prime accused in the chit fund scam, in connection with a proposed deal between him and Ms. Sinh.
The CBI had earlier questioned Ms. Sinh for her suspected role in the scam. According to the agency, probe have indicated that she had financial dealings with one of the Saradha group companies. In his April 2013 letter to the CBI, Sudipto Sen had alleged that he had dealings worth about Rs.28 crore with her, which included Rs.25 crore payment made out to company. In the same letter, he mentioned that Ms. Sinh had introduced him to Ms. Chidambaram as her legal advisor.

Katie On Field Sex Pics:  People Aren t Adventurous EnoughKatie Hopkins Addresses 'Naked Field Sex' Pictures With Keith Lemon On 'Celebrity Juice'
The Huffington Post UK  | By Daniel Welsh
reddit
Katie Hopkins found herself at the butt of the jokes for a change, during an appearance on ‘ Celebrity Juice ’ on Thursday night - most notably when presenter Keith Lemon made light of the fact she was once caught having sex in a field.
In 2007, back when she was best known as a contestant on ‘ The Apprentice ’, rather than a keyboard warrior and professional weight-gainer , Katie made headlines when photographers snapped her frolicking in nature with a married former colleague.
And when we say “frolicking in nature”, we, of course mean “having sex in a field”.
Katie Hopkins
Fair play to Katie, she held her own when asked about the incident during her stint on the panel show, stating simply: “I did have sex in a field, there’s no denying that, there’s no getting away from it.”
She even stuck up for herself and suggested that more people should follow in her footsteps, claiming: “I would say, that people aren’t adventurous enough!”
The episode also marked the first appearance of celebrity chef Gino D’Acampo as a team captain , filling in for Holly Willoughby while she’s on maternity leave.
Katie had originally been tipped to feature on ‘Celebrity Juice’ back in April, though her appearance was reportedly axed following the death of Peaches Geldof , who she had come to blows with previously during a debate on ‘This Morning’.
She later hit out at Peaches when it emerged that her death had been caused by a heroin overdose, causing major outrage when she tweeted: “Let's turn the tables. It was me that took an overdose whilst caring for my 11 month old would I be a fallen angel too? [sic]”

GM recalls cars over parking brake fire riskGeneral Motors recalls cars over parking brake fire risk
By Reuters | 21 Sep, 2014, 10.16PM IST
US car manufacturer General Motors Co is recalling hundreds of thousands of cars over a defect in the parking brake that could cause a fire.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: US car manufacturer General Motors Co is recalling hundreds of thousands of cars over a defect in the parking brake that could cause a fire, a letter by the top US auto safety regulator showed.
The problem occurred with GM's 2013-2015 Cadillac XTS and the 2014-2015 Chevrolet Impala , said the Sept. 19 letter from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), seen by Reuters.
The total number of cars recalled was 221,558, the company said, including 205,309 in the United States, and the remainder in Canada and other countries.
"GM is not aware of any crashes, injuries or fatalities as a result of this condition," the company said.
The problem was that the brake's indicator light sometimes failed to illuminate while the brake was not fully retracted.
"If the vehicle is operated for an extended period of time in this condition, there is a potential for the rear brakes to generate significant heat, smoke and sparks," the NHTSA said.
"Brake pads that remain partially engaged with the rotors may cause excessive brake heat that may result in a fire."
The NHTSA's deputy administrator David Friedman last week heavily criticized General Motors for not reporting and recalling cars promptly over problems with ignition switches that are now linked to at least 19 deaths.
The company has recalled nearly 15 million vehicles worldwide this year over the problem with the switches.

Arab nations need to help in Iraq: US GeneralThe US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, said the administration is pleased with its progress in building a coalition.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
ZAGREB (CROTIA): The US-led military campaign plan to retake Iraqi territory held by the Islamic State group calls for attacking the extremists from several directions simultaneously, and its success depends on getting more Arab help, the top American military officer said Sunday.
"We want them to wake up every day realizing that they are being squeezed from multiple directions," Army Gen. Martin Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters, referring to the Islamic State group, which also is known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS.
"If we can get ISIL looking in about five different directions, that's the desired end state," he added in an interview with reporters traveling with him to Croatia from Lithuania, where he discussed Iraq and other issues with his NATO counterparts.
Dempsey stressed the importance of gaining more Arab participation in the US-led effort, suggesting that without it the military campaign might not move to its next phase. He called wider Arab participation a prerequisite for President Barack Obama's approval of the military campaign plan. Obama was briefed on the plan last week but has not okayed it.
In an opinion column published Sunday in the Tampa Bay Times, Obama wrote, "This is not and will not be America's fight alone. That's why we continue to build a broad international coalition." He said Arab countries have offered to help but he mentioned none by name and did not describe their specific roles.
The US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, said the administration is pleased with its progress in building a coalition.
"The commitments are coming in every day," she said on NBC's "Meet the Press." However, she did not name individual Arab countries that have promised to participate in military action in Iraq, saying it was up to them to describe their own roles.
Obama's signature on the military campaign plan for Iraq and Syria operations would move the effort into a new phase, Dempsey said, enabled by a larger number of coalition aircraft that would allow for a more persistent presence over the battlefields of Iraq and improved prospects for rebuilding key elements of the Iraqi army. Dempsey said last week that only about half of Iraqi army brigades, which originally were trained by the US, are suitable partners now for the US. On Sunday he said one of the major problems with the other half is that they have been infiltrated by extremists.
Dempsey focused his comments on military action in Iraq rather than Syria.
"We want to go from being episodic with our offensive operations to sustained," he said, adding that no one should expect a dramatic increase in airstrikes but rather a series of increases calculated to match Iraq's ability to retake territory with its own ground forces. Obama has ruled out US troops fighting another ground war in Iraq.
Obama authorized US airstrikes in Iraq on Aug. 8, and earlier this month he announced Washington would lead an international effort linked to the formation of a more inclusive government in Baghdad. That plan includes the prospect of US airstrikes in neighboring Syria, but Dempsey has said the Pentagon's first priority is pushing the military campaign in Iraq.
A number of Iraq's Arab neighbors, including Jordan and Saudi Arabia, have said they support the US effort but have not publicly committed to taking any offensive role in Iraq. France is the only ally that has joined thus far in airstrikes in Iraq.
Having more Arab countries involved would make the Iraq campaign more sustainable and "more credible that is to say, this is not just about the United States; this is a regional and even an international issue," Dempsey said.
The general said he spoke to his Turkish counterpart during the weekend NATO meeting in Lithuania about Turkey's role in the conflict. He said the allied military chiefs also discussed the prospect of NATO playing a part in training and equipping Iraq security forces, although no decisions were made.
Dempsey said he has no estimate of how many coalition forces he would like to see join with the US in fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq, but he ticked off a list of military capabilities that he hopes can be provided by Arab nations and others. These include intelligence sharing, aerial refueling aircraft, surveillance and reconnaissance planes, precision strike aircraft, and financial assistance for the training and equipping of Iraqi troops as well as the Syrian moderate opposition.

Modi govt may loosen its purse strings; may reduce borrowingsArun Jaitley
(The government has already…)
CAIRNS: After two years of massive spending cuts that knocked the wind out of an already slowing economy, the finance ministry is ready to give ministries their full budget and even reduce market borrowing if the current pace of growth can be maintained.
This could itself spark off a virtuous cycle of higher government spending contributing to revival after two years of growth that slumped to decadal lows of below-5%. The Indian economy expanded by a two-year high of 5.7% in the first quarter of the current fiscal.
"You cannot have three years of continuous expenditure cut," Finance Secretary Arvind Mayaram told ET on the sidelines of the G20 finance ministers' meeting, indicating that the finance ministry may be willing to offer some room to ministries and departments on spending.
The government has already reduced first-half borrowing by Rs 16,000 crore and may not borrow this at all if things go according to plan.
"If growth maintains the pace and remains 5.6-5.7% in the second quarter as well, we may not need to (borrow the remaining Rs 16,000 crore in the first half)," Mayaram said, adding that it was too early to take a decision on this.
The Centre's second-half borrowing target is likely to be announced later this week and the government may stay with the one announced in the interim budget, or even top it up with the Rs 16,000 crore less it looks set to borrow in the first half to be on the safe side.
The government had budgeted to borrow Rs 3.68 trillion in the first half and Rs 2.32 trillion in the second half for a total of Rs 6 trillion according to the interim budget that the new government adopted in its final budget.
The Narendra Modi-led government could also look at retiring old debt to lower its interest outgo as part of fiscal management if ministries are unable to spend their allocation and there is a surplus.
This will also give the government room to clear Rs 12,000 crore in central sales tax (CST) dues owed to states, which could strongly boost prospects of their assent to goods & services tax ( GST ), which the Centre wants to implement as quickly as possible.
ET has reported that the government was confident about meeting its fiscal deficit target of 4.1% of GDP , about which there had been some concern when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented his maiden budget on July 10.
Ministries and departments were forced to cope with huge spending cuts in the past two financial years and some level of austerity before that as the government fought to keep the fiscal deficit in check in a desperate bid to avoid a ratings downgrade. As much as Rs 1 trillion of plan spending was cut in each of the two years as part of the fiscal consolidation drive.
However, expenditure will have to be rational and in a prudent manner, the finance secretary said, indicating that quality of spending will be a key focus of the new government.
A commission has already been set up to review government spending. All this will be contingent on revenue inflow, which is expected to see a pickup on the back of a revival in growth and also from stake sales in government companies.
If revenue flows surpass expectations, the government could also look at retiring some debt to bring down interest costs, which will have a positive effect on India's sovereign rating.
The government has budgeted for a growth rate of 16.9% in tax collections to Rs 13.6 trillion. In the first four months of the year, the government has collected only 15% of budgeted taxes but August numbers are much better. Indirect taxes, a key economic indicator, grew 9%, more than double rate in first four months.
The Reserve Bank of India has also transferred its entire surplus of Rs 52,679 crore to the government's kitty against the Rs 62,414 crore budgeted for the full year from public sector banks and the central bank as dividend and surplus. The Cabinet has cleared stake sales in ONGC, SAIL and Coal India that alone will help raise as much as the Rs 43,425 crore budgeted from the disinvestment of state-owned companies on the back of booming stock markets. Residual stake sales in Balco and Hindustan Zinc are also expected to fetch more than the budgeted Rs 15,000 crore. Subsidies that have been a huge challenge in the past few years are expected to remain in check this year with crude oil prices subdued and diesel price getting market-linked.

Don t ease up on Iran for help against IS: N...Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday warned the West against easing sanctions on Iran to win its support in the fight against jihadists in Syria and Iraq.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday warned the West against easing sanctions on Iran to win its support in the fight against jihadists in Syria and Iraq.
As the Islamic republic and six world powers started a new round of talks in New York on the Iranian nuclear programme, Netanyahu said "respected commentators in the West" were counselling a softer approach to enlist Tehran in an alliance against Islamic State militants.
"They are fighting the IS out of their own interest," his office quoted him as telling an audience in Jerusalem.
"They are struggling over who will be leader of the Islamist world which they seek to impose on the whole world," he said, referring to Iran.
Israel bitterly opposed an interim deal which world powers struck with Tehran last November, paving the way for talks on a comprehensive agreement on Iran's future nuclear activities.
Iran and the six powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States plus Germany -- are meeting at United Nations headquarters on the sidelines of the General Assembly.
Israel has refused to rule out military action against Iranian nuclear facilities to prevent any possibility of it developing the technology for an atomic bomb.

Siemens near deal to buy Dresser-Rand: SourcesThe German industrial conglomerate Siemens AG is near an agreement to acquire U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand Group Inc for all cash, people familiar with the matter said.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
FRANKFURT: Industrial conglomerate Siemens AG said on Monday it would buy U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand Group Inc for $7.6 billion in a move that would significantly boost the German company's oil and gas business in North America.
Germany's Siemens said its $83 per-share bid was unanimously supported by Dresser-Rand's board of directors. That compares with a Friday closing price of $79.91, which was up 27 percent over the past three months on takeover speculation.
Within minutes of that statement, it also announced the sale of its 50 percent stake in BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeraete GmbH to joint venture partner Robert Bosch GmbH for 3 billion euros ($3.85 billion), ending their more than 45 year alliance in household appliances.
"As the premium brand in the global energy infrastructure markets, Dresser-Rand is a perfect fit for the Siemens portfolio. The combined activities will create a world-class provider for the growing oil and gas markets," Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said in a statement on Monday.
Reuters reported on Sunday that the companies were nearing a deal.
The German industrial conglomerate had long coveted Dresser-Rand, which would help it grow its oil and gas business at a time when a North American fracking boom is boosting demand for energy equipment.
But it shrank in the past from making a formal bid, balking at its high valuation. Dresser-Rand trades at 24.6 times 12 month forward earnings, a 60 percent premium to its peers in oil and gas equipment and services, according to Reuters data.
CEO Kaeser said in July the company planned to focus on restructuring rather than acquisitions for the moment, but would have the financial firepower for the right acquisition target. Cash reserves stood at 8.21 billion euros at the end of June.
Siemens is targeting more than 150 million euros in annual synergies by 2019 from the transaction, which complements Siemens's market position in turbo compressors, downstream and industrial applications as well as larger-sized steam turbines .
Siemens expects to close the Dresser-Rand deal by summer 2015, while it aims to wrap up the sale of its stake in household appliance venture BSH with Bosch in first half of 2015.
BSH will pay out 250 million euros to each of its owners Bosch and Siemens before the transaction is completed.
Siemens has trumped a competing offer for Dresser-Rand from Swiss pump maker Sulzer AG , which had proposed an all-stock merger, according to people familiar with the matter.
Sulzer's chairman is former Siemens CEO Peter Loescher, who Kaeser replaced in a boardroom coup last year.
But other rival bidders may be lurking. General Electric was considering whether to make a bid, the Financial Times cited people familiar with the matter as saying on Friday.
Any GE involvement would mean their archrivalry picking up steam again. Siemens lost out to GE in a fierce bidding tussle over Alstom's energy business in June.
The Dresser-Rand deal would eclipse Siemens acquisitions over recent year. Siemens bought Dade Behring for $7 billion under Kaeser's predecessor Loescher in 2007, in a deal that was widely criticised as overpriced.
Siemens filled another gap in its energy equipment portfolio earlier this year, buying small gas-turbine assets from Rolls-Royce for 950 million euros. CEO Kaeser indicated at the time that expansion in the United States was next on the agenda.

Thousands protest climate change at world ra...Tens of thousands protest climate change at world rallies
By AFP | 22 Sep, 2014, 01.49AM IST
Tens of thousands of people marched in New York and across the globe on Sunday, joined by celebrities and political leaders to demand urgent action to stem climate change.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: Tens of thousands of people marched in New York and across the globe on Sunday, joined by celebrities and political leaders to demand urgent action to stem climate change.
Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio , US former vice president turned advocate Al Gore , UN chief Ban Ki-moon and New York mayor Bill de Blasio marched down Sixth Avenue in what organizers hoped would be the largest such protest in history.
In London, an estimated 40,000 people paraded past Trafalgar Square and the Houses of Parliament, including British actress Emma Thompson who likened the threat posed by climate change to a Martian invasion.
They were the largest of around 2,500 events and marches taking place around the world ahead of a climate change summit hosted by Ban Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.
Elderly protesters, leaning on walking sticks and sitting in wheelchairs, joined young parents with children in push chairs, adults in fancy dress and community groups from all over the world in New York to march for change.
"It's very important. Our climate is killing us," Coula Farris, an 88-year-old New Yorker told AFP. "Young people deserve a better world and I'm very lucky I can walk," she said.
There were chants of "we are idle not more" and "hey, hey, ho, ho, fossil fuels have got to go," as the colorful march made its way down Sixth Avenue with giant floats, balloons and banners with slogans such as "Urgent, Save our Planet."
Ban, wearing a baseball cap and a T-shirt with the words "I'm for Climate Action," praised de Blasio for announcing Sunday that New York would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent over 2005 levels by 2050.
The UN secretary general walked nine blocks in the parade with Gore, de Blasio, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and French Ecology Minister Segolene Royal, who wore a green suit and high heels.
"Our mission is to make this a decisive moment, a turning point moment and I felt today that I was seeing history starting to be made," de Blasio said.
In Paris, nearly 5,000 people protested, according to police estimates, many on bikes, with banners that read "Climate in danger" or "World leaders, act!"
"Before we could say we didn't know. Now we know. Climate change is already underway," Nicolas Hulot, the president's special envoy for the protection of the planet, told the crowd in central Paris.
Hundreds more protested in several other cities in France, including up to 700 in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.
In Madrid, hundreds gathered in front of the environment ministry, brandishing signs with slogans including "There's no Planet B," "Change your life, not your climate," and "Our climate, your decision."
In Cairns, Australia , where finance ministers from the G20 nations were meeting, more than 100 people wearing green paper hearts around their necks gathered outside the venue.
They repeatedly chanted "Every dollar spent, every single cent, 100 percent, green energy" and carried banners including one that read: "Add climate change to the G20."
"I'm here because I'm a parent, I'm here because I'm a scientist, I understand what climate change means for our planet, our children, our economy, our health," said John Rainbird, an Australian biologist.
Hundreds also gathered in Sydney , Australia, and in New Delhi, India, where around 300 protesters carried placards that read "I want to save forests" and "Coal kills", as they shouted slogans and danced to pounding drum beats.
Police had no immediate estimate of turnout in New York, but witnesses told AFP that tens of thousands took part. London organizers, who said about 40,000 marched there, said the turnout exceeded their expectations.
The "People's Climate March" in New York was endorsed by more than 1,400 organizations, including environment, faith and justice groups, as well as labor unions. Students have mobilized marchers from more than 300 college campuses.
The protest wound its way from Central Park West through midtown on a two-mile (3.2-kilometer) route that was to end at 11th Avenue between 34th and 38th Streets.
Ricken Patel , executive director of Avaaz, a pressure group that is one of the organizers, presented a petition signed by two million people to Ban.
"We feel very confident that we will achieve our goal, which is to have the largest climate change march in history," Patel told AFP.
After a moment of silence, slightly obscured in the chaos, participants used instruments, alarms and whistles to make as much noise as possible at 1 pm.
The UN meeting Tuesday sets the stage for a crucial conference in Paris in December 2015 aimed at finalizing an agreement.

Apple s new iPhones score big in durability:...Apple's new and bigger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are more durable than last year's model and a leading Android phone, a study says.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: Apple's new and bigger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are more durable than last year's model and a leading Android phone, a study says.
Apple's iPhone 6, whose screen measures 4.7 inches (11.9 centimeters), did the best across a variety of tests that measures how prone smartphones are to break due to every day accidents, SquareTrade, a company that provides extended protection plans, says.
The iPhone Plus 6, whose screen measures 5.5 inches (14 centimeters), wasn't far behind but lost points because it could slip out of a person's hand since some users may have a hard time gripping its large but slim form, SquareTrade says.
The iPhone 5s, which measures 4 inches (10 centimeters) and came out last year, fared better than Samsung's Galaxy S5, which measures 5.1 inches (12.95 centimeters). The Samsung phone got poor marks on several tests including the slide test. The more a phone slides, the greater its chance of falling off the edge of a table.
Still, all four of the smartphones tested had a medium risk of breakage and had no drastic differences among them.
``The phones are getting more and more durable,'' says Ty Shay, chief marketing officer at SquareTrade. ``Manufacturers are paying more attention.''
SquareTrade examines the phones based on eight factors, including size, weight, grip and the quality of the front and back panels. The company measured how far the phones slide when pushed across a table on their backs and how well they withstand drops from 4 feet (1.2 meters) and being dunked in water for 10 seconds.
SquareTrade says it uses robots to do the testing to ensure consistency, and rates the phones on a 10-point durability scale, with 10 signifying the highest risk. Apple's iPhone 6 scored the best at 4; the iPhone 6 Plus scored a 5; the iPhone 5s a 6; and Samsung Galaxy S5 a 6.5.
Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus passed the slide test, but the iPhone 5s and Samsung Galaxy's S5 got poor marks in that area. The iPhone 6 Plus was the only one that didn't fare as well when dropped 4 feet (1.2 meters) by the robot. The glass screen survived, but the case separated from the glass. All four phones fared well in the water resistance test.
SquareTrade provided The Associated Press with the results ahead of Monday's announcement.
Aside from larger screens, the new Apple iPhones 6 and 6 Plus announced this month promises faster performance and offers a wireless chip for making credit card payments at stores by holding the phone near the payment terminal. The phones start at $199 with a two-year service contact. The phones went on sale this past week in the U.S. and nine other countries.

The fear and hopelessness behind the bloody attack on Ebola health workers in GuineaBy Abby Phillip September 19 Follow @abbydphillip

When the Ebola outbreak made a resurgence in Guinea in early August, after earlier showing signs of stabilizing, Moise Mamy knew what he needed to do.
The Guinean pastor had already been traveling from remote village to remote village three times a week to spread awareness about preventing and containing the deadly virus. But as the outbreak flared up again, Mamy and a team of workers from the non-governmental organization Eau de la Vie (Water of Life) began going to the villages five times a week.
The instruction they provided was simple, focusing on washing and water purification practices. But Mamy was convinced that more visits to the isolated areas to was necessary to bring an end to the deadly epidemic.
It was exhausting work, and the team often encountered resistance, Mamy told others; but, he said, it needed to be done.
"This Ebola is a menace that can overrun the country," Mamy warned recently in an e-mail to the leader of a U.S. aid organization.
On Tuesday, Mamy and his team took a truck that was already damaged by rocks that had been thrown at them during visits to other remote villages and drove to Wome, in the forested, southeastern part of Guinea.
This time, they enlisted local officials to help ease the tensions and fear that run rampant in that part of the country, which is near where the deadly outbreak began.
"The meeting started off well; the traditional chiefs welcomed the delegation with 10 kola nuts as a traditional greeting," said a resident who was present at the meeting, a man identified as "Yves" told the Guardian . But a group of young people arrived, Yves said, and they began throwing stones.
Then, some members of Mamy's team were dragged away.
Then, the unthinkable happened.
Eight people, including Mamy, were murdered by a mob -- " killed in cold blood ," a government spokesman said. Their bodies were found Thursday, some of them dumped in a septic tank behind a primary school. Three of them, the spokesman said, had their throats slit.
"Many places accepted their teaching," Jon Erickson , a friend of Mamy's who works with the Christian aid organization CAMA Services, wrote in an online posting. "But some villagers had heard a rumor that the [bleach they were distributing], which kills the Ebola virus, was actually the virus itself."
On Friday, six suspects were arrested . Guinean officials are investigating what prompted the attack.
The depths of the fear that could provoke such an attack are hard to understand, but it is partly fueled by the fact that Ebola has hit hardest in Guinea in a remote, conflict-burdened part of the country.
Wome is located in Guinea's forestière region -- a densely forested, mountainous and resource-rich area where villagers have long settled their own affairs.

Last year, at least 50 people were burned and hacked to death in ethnic conflicts that erupted in the region , a lingering side effect of the civil war that engulfed neighboring Liberia for 14 years.
People who live in the most rural parts of Guinea forestière are often long distances, by difficult-to-traverse roads, from the nearest large city, Nzerekore. They are even farther from the center of government in Conakry.
"In Guinea forestière, there are a lot of ethnicities, and it’s where a lot of the minerals are,” said Tara Comstock-Green, who works with a conflict mediation non-profit Search for Common Ground, in Conakry. “It’s a region where people are really trying to struggle for power.”
Youths in particular feel isolated and mistrustful of the government and outsiders, said Mike Jobbins, Search for Common Ground's senior program manager for Africa.
"You have a lot of already existing tensions between people who have been living in these communities and more recent outsiders who have come to the country with the mining boom," Jobbins said. "Young people are coming of age into a very desperate economic situation. They don’t have the opportunity to advance themselves; they don’t feel like they're being treated fairly.
"It makes young people much more likely to get involved in the violence."
And then came Ebola -- bringing with it health workers in terrifying moon suits and outsiders, including foreigners, spraying unfamiliar substances.
Last month, in a market in Nzerekore, about 30 miles from Wome, residents panicked when Red Cross workers began spraying disinfectant after a funeral.
"Ebola is a lie!” they shouted. There were reports of gunshots.
"A rumor, which was totally false, spread that we had sprayed the market in order to transmit the virus to locals," said Youssouf Traore, president of the Guinean Red Cross, according to the BBC .
One notable characteristic of this week's gruesome murders in Guinea is that the victims were not foreigners.
Before Ebola became the predominant agenda item for his organization, Mamy, the executive secretary for Eau de la Vie, was a well-known religious leader in the region who helped to build schools as a compliment to the medical care provided at a place called Hope Clinic.
Mamy's visit to Wome this week was not his first, and he was accompanied by local elected officials, health care workers and three journalists, two of whom were from a trusted rural radio news source.
"He was pretty well known and well respected, but it could be they just underestimated the depth of suspicion and fear and anger," said Mike Sohm, president of CAMA Services, which founded Hope Clinic in 2003 before it was turned over to Mamy and a team of Guinean nationals a decade later.
"It’s not that they were unaware of the dangers -- they were willing to take the risk.”

For ordering gang-rape  13 get life imprisonmentPrint
KOLKATA: A court in West Bengal sentenced 13 people to life imprisonment for gang-raping a tribal girl in Birbhum’s Subalpur in January on the orders of a kangaroo court.
The additional district and sessions judge of Bolpur, Sidhhartha Roy Choudhury was quoted by The Telegraph saying: 'You have been found guilty under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 376D (gang rape) of the IPC. The maximum punishment is life imprisonment and the minimum punishment is 20 years in jail.'
"The court of Bolpur additional district judge Siddarth Roychowdhury sentenced all the 13 accused to 20 years rigorous imprisonment. All the accused were convicted of gang-rape, assault and wrongful confinement," public prosecutor Shamsul Zoha said.
During the course of the trial, the court examined 31 witnesses, including medical experts and police officers.
The court also directed the district administration to take care of the dependents, if any, of the 13 accused which includes the village headman who had ordered the gang-rape.
In January, a 20-year-old tribal girl in West Bengal's Birbhum district was gang-raped by 13 members of the village panchayat as a punishment for having an affair with a man from another community.
The 13 men were a part of a local village court that ordered the gang-rape as a punishment.
The incident took place in Subalpur village in Birbhum district after a few villagers saw the girl's friend at her house and complained to the headman.
The girl said that she along with her friend was dragged to a gathering where our village headman was also present.
The woman said she was left at the mercy of the men of her village after she was unable to pay Rs.50,000 as a fine demanded by the morol (headman) for having an affair with a man outside her community.
"The morol ordered that I be enjoyed by the men of the village. Following his orders, at least 10-12 people, including (some) members of a single family, continuously raped me. I lost count of how many times I was raped," said the woman.

Yahoo Movies Review: Daawat-e-IshqCast: Aditya Roy Kapur, Parineeti Chopra, Anupam Kher
Direction: Habib Faisal
Rating: ***1/2
‘Daawat-e-Ishq’ is a delectable love story. And what I like about this flossy romance is that it manages to pack-in a neat little message for prospective grooms and dowry-seeking parents.
Usually I love Parineeti Chopra, who plays the feisty Gulrez Qadir, in this film. Gullu is good but Tariq Haidar (Aditya Roy Kapur) is even better. Our Lucknowi cook Taru, with his surma-lined eyes, unpolishedEnglish and brash manners is a sure charmer.
I find it refreshing that even though Gullu falls for Taru’s tasty treats and his smoky eyes, she stays focused on her plan. It doesn’t seem right that despite his genuine honesty, she has no change of heart but then, she didn’t get a fair deal in the first place. Her anger and revenge seem misplaced but then she doesn’t seem like a person, who has really thought through her plans. She is guided more by her impulses and less by the consequences.
Her father is the complete opposite but he decides to support her daughter’s somewhat ridiculous plans nevertheless. And while Anupam Kher is brilliant as the under-confident father, afraid of the repercussions, it just doesn’t ring true that he associates himself with his daughter’s deceptive means.
I guess in a film like this one, if we had a robust supporting cast, it would have added a much-needed zing to the film.
‘Daawat-e-Ishq’ however, makes two important points without much sermonizing. First, no matter whether it’s love or an arranged marriage, most people are the same when it comes down to the business of it all. They wouldn’t flinch about asking for money and jewelry because that is just an accepted part of the tradition of the big fat Indian wedding.
And also, you can’t help but feel sorry and at the same time repulsed by these so-called educated modern men, who just don’t stand-up for their beliefs. They are ready to sit and watch their parents as they belittle unsuspecting families of prospective brides and conduct their marriages like a mere business transaction.
The film is not flawless and there seems to be a little glossing over the details. I mean how do you find a person on Facebook if you don’t even know their real name? But if you are ready to overlook the nuances, ‘Daawat-e-Ishq’ is a breezy watch and Aditya Roy Kapur is sure getting better at his game.

How complacency almost lost a united kingdomFurther reading
Lynton Crosby, the Tory party’s general election campaign chief, was not involved in the campaign, which relied for much of its organisation and groundwork on the Labour party, with its vast and once-mighty Scottish operation. To be fair to Mr Cameron, Labour was also convinced it would beat Mr Salmond in a toe-to-toe battle on independence.
As recently as this summer, senior No campaigners were more concerned about the size of the victory than the fact of it. “We need to get 60 per cent if we are to avoid a neverendum,” said one campaign insider several weeks before the vote, referring to the possibility of another ballot being called within years or even months in the event of a close result.
All this time, a broad Yes movement was developing, reaching far beyond traditional SNP support. At first it seemed to have little impact. The official pro-union Better Together campaign pummelled the SNP over the uncertainties of independence. The party’s 667-page vision for an independent nation, published in November 2013 and including promises of better childcare, lower taxes and more generous social security, brought no immediate boost to nationalist support.
In early 2014, the No camp lead started to narrow. So pro-union politicians prepared what they hoped would be a fatal blow to Mr Salmond’s plans.
Many who were in the conference room in Edinburgh, where Mr Osborne on February 13 ruled out a post-independence currency union, thought that a killer blow was exactly what had been delivered. Speaking in front of a plate-glass window looking out at Edinburgh’s Castle Rock, the UK chancellor targeted the biggest weakness in the SNP’s economic case – its claim that Scotland would continue to use the pound as it does now, a promise dependent on London’s consent.
Mr Osborne was backed by the leaders of all three main UK parties – and given unprecedented public support by Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the Treasury’s top civil servant.
The assault, delivered by a Conservative chancellor deeply unpopular in Scotland, had mixed results. The SNP dismissed it as bullying and bluff – and polls showed that many voters in Scotland agreed. But Mr Osborne insists he was right and that this week’s No vote vindicated his strategy of highlighting the risks of independence. “It’s a No campaign, so of course it’s going to be negative,” the chancellor has said.
Meanwhile, the Yes campaign was developing into a grassroots movement far more energetic and organic than Better Together could muster. SNP strategists were building on the databases and tactics that had delivered the 2011 landslide. Their strategy aimed to persuade voters first that Scotland could be independent, next that it should be, and finally that it must be.
Still, Westminster was untroubled. Two months ago, Mr Cameron had dinner with a close friend from the corporate world, according to one senior business figure. Of all the things in his prime ministerial in-tray, the business figure recalls Mr Cameron saying, Scotland was “the least of his worries”.
Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne departed for their summer holidays in August in confident mood. Mr Osborne was heard to remark breezily to colleagues that he would “take 60-40” as a final result.
Polling advice provided by Populus suggested the No lead was solid and backed up Mr Osborne’s conviction that Better Together’s focus on the drawbacks of independence rather than the benefits of union was working to stop wavering voters following their emotions and voting Yes.
But public opinion was turning towards Yes. Some credited Mr Salmond’s strong performance in a second televised debate against Alistair Darling, former UK chancellor and Better Together leader. There, he warded off challenges on currency and scathingly portrayed Mr Darling as being “in bed with the Tories”, and the National Health Service as under threat from continued union.
The NHS warning became the central argument of the third phase of the Yes campaign plan, the effort to persuade voters that Scotland would be most at risk staying in the UK. Pro-union politicians furiously pointed out that Scotland already runs its NHS independently, but found many Labour voters easily persuaded that it could be destroyed by UK austerity and privatisation policies.
One Better Together insider blamed the lack of co-ordination between the rival Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrats. “If we had had a string of health secretaries coming up to Scotland to say they admired the Scottish NHS but had nothing to do with the running of it, that might have helped. We just couldn’t get our act together,” the insider said.
No campaigners say “the pendulum started to swing” towards Yes in late August, though they are unsure exactly why. By early September, Douglas Alexander, Labour’s campaign chief on the ground, was “deeply troubled”. The cold facts deployed by the No campaign were suddenly being trumped by the optimism and emotion of the Yes side. “There was a shift below the level of logic,” he said.
It was during a visit to Dundee on the first day of September that Mr Salmond first really began to believe the Yes camp could actually win.
The first minister had always publicly exuded confidence – but he was also acutely aware that never in Scotland’s democratic history had independence commanded majority support. Now he saw long queues of people waiting to register to vote, many of them for the first time – a sign of the success of pro-independence campaign efforts to tap the widespread disillusionment with the UK government among Scotland’s often politically unengaged lower-income groups.
“I spoke to these people and they weren’t queueing up patiently in Dundee that day to vote No,” Mr Salmond said on the eve of the referendum. “That for me was the key moment when I became convinced that we had a great chance of winning.”
By the weekend of September 6-7 there was panic inside Number 10, while Mr Cameron was obliged to leave London with a knot in his stomach to stay with the Queen at Balmoral. Mr Alexander and Danny Alexander – the Treasury minister overseeing the Lib Dem campaign – reported that the momentum to Yes might become unstoppable. That fateful YouGov poll put the Yes side ahead.
“We knew a poll was coming which would give the Yes side a lead – it turned out to be YouGov in the Sunday Times. We were at a point where we had to reframe the campaign,” Douglas Alexander said later.
Frantic discussions took place over that weekend between “the two Alexanders” and Mr Dunlop, who by now were the principal players in the fight to save the union. Mr Dunlop hit the phones to try to corral a business onslaught, joined by Danny Alexander and Mr Darling. By Wednesday, a trickle of companies led by Shell and BP were speaking out; by Thursday there was a torrent.
Mr Cameron turned up the heat on business leaders to intervene in the debate, hosting a reception on September 8 in Downing Street. “He left us in no doubt we should speak out,” said one chief executive who attended. The prime minister was also hitting the phones. “Those phone calls can be very persuasive,” said one business figure familiar with the operation.
The result was a wave of business opposition to independence , with companies such as Aviva and Prudential coming out to bat on the prime minister's behalf, although a few – including J Sainsbury, National Grid and Tesco – could not be persuaded.
On the Thursday before the referendum, five Scottish-based banks said they would move their registered headquarters south if there was a Yes vote. But the orchestrated campaign also risked fuelling Scottish resentment of Westminster. Mr Salmond loudly protested against Downing Street “ scaremongering ” and blamed a hostile BBC for playing along.
Even the Queen joined the fray – her media advisers orchestrating a “chance remark” to a churchgoer near Balmoral that Scottish voters should “think very carefully about the future”. Buckingham Palace said she was strictly neutral, but royal watchers had little doubt about the Queen’s concerns about a break-up of the union, despite Mr Salmond saying he looked forward to her becoming Queen of Scots.
The fightback also had a new public face: Gordon Brown . The former Labour prime minister, had been on the fringes of the No campaign for months, but his refusal to work with the Tories and tense relations with Mr Darling, his former chancellor, meant that he often operated alone. Now he was brought centre stage, making the “positive case” for a No vote: promising a swift transfer of new powers to the Scottish parliament to demonstrate to wavering Labour voters that a No vote did not mean “no change”.
A remarkable speech at a closing rally at Maryhill in Glasgow saw Mr Brown rediscover the fire that had made him such a formidable politician. “Tell them this is our Scotland, our flag, our streets,” Mr Brown growled at an audience cowed by months of being told by Yes campaigners they were not “true Scots”. Unlike the mild-mannered Mr Darling, Mr Brown looked like he wanted to thump Mr Salmond; he put much-needed fire in the belly of Labour supporters as polling day approached.
The unlikely alliance of Mr Brown, the Queen and an array of FTSE 100 bosses appeared to stop Mr Salmond’s advance, just days before polling day, and the Yes campaign never recovered its momentum. “There was a real danger that it would slip away from us the next week,” Douglas Alexander admits. “We thought that Salmond would turn the final stage of a campaign into a carnival and sweep voters along on a tide of emotion.”
The combination of economic scare stories and promises of future power seemed to work, while it proved harder than independence campaigners had hoped to mobilise the disaffected urban population.
By the last days of the campaign, pro-union leaders were increasingly confident they could hold the line. On Friday morning, they were shown to be right. The victory when it came was clear. But by voting for independence, 1.6m Scots graphically demonstrated the depth of popular discontent with Westminster rule. For pro-union politicians the two-year campaign race ended not in a triumphant last lap but a panicky late sprint over the winning line. This was far from the emphatic reaffirmation of union they had expected.

Salmond exits  hails moment of opportunityUnbowed even in defeat, Salmond leaves formidable nationalist legacy

Scottish first minister Alex Salmond
When Alex Salmond, Scotland’s first minister, announced he would step down as leader of the Scottish National party, he showed little of the humility that might be expected of a politician taking responsibility for defeat in a historic referendum.
Indeed, the way Mr Salmond told it, the rejection by Scottish voters of independence sounded more like a success.

UK slips in global table for business tax
Mr Salmond, who has led Scotland for seven years and the SNP for 10, said the referendum had left his nation “at a moment of great political opportunity” – though not one that he would be seizing.
“I believe this is a new exciting situation that is redolent with possibility, but in that situation I think the party, parliament and country would benefit from new leadership,” he told a press conference at his elegant Edinburgh official residence.
Mr Salmond’s announcement came as a particular surprise because early on Friday morning, a relaxed first minister had delivered a markedly upbeat – and carefully conditional – referendum concession speech.
“Scotland has by a majority decided, at this stage, not to become an independent country. I accept that verdict of the people and I call on all of Scotland to follow suit,” he said then.
Mr Salmond has repeatedly stated that an independence referendum is a once-in-a-generation political event, although when he announced his resignation he made clear that was a personal view rather than a position that might bind the SNP indefinitely.
Mr Salmond’s upbeat view of the situation was not merely a manifestation of the extraordinary self-confidence that has sustained him through a roller-coaster political career that took the former economist and his party from the political fringes to Scottish government.
Even critics acknowledge that the 45 per cent of voters who backed independence on Thursday marked a fresh peak in nationalist support in Scotland’s modern political history.
A referendum which pro-union parties originally expected to win at a stroll turned into a nail-biting battle that left the No campaign scrambling in the campaign’s final days to promise rapid devolution of new powers to the Scottish parliament in a desperate attempt to shore up support for the Union.
Mr Salmond said he was taking responsibility for any failings in the referendum campaign, though he gave little hint that he felt it had come up short. Instead he insisted the poll had left Scotland well placed to secure greater powers from the UK government in Westminster – and that it thus marked a step forward toward the ultimate goal of full independence.
The Yes campaign’s success in winning the support of 1.6m Scottish voters would give it great leverage in negotiations on a new balance of constitutional authority between London and Edinburgh, said Mr Salmond, who indicated he would continue as a member of the Scottish parliament.
“We have the opportunity to hold Westminster’s feet to the fire on the vow that they have made to devolve further meaningful power to Scotland. This places Scotland in a very strong position,” the first minister said.
“For me as leader, my time is nearly over, but for Scotland the campaign continues and the dream shall never die.” The process of selecting a new leader would be “energising” for the party, he added.
Though Mr Salmond declined to name a preferred successor, his deputy as first minister Nicola Sturgeon is now the clear favourite to become the first female leader of the devolved Scottish government.
Ms Sturgeon, a former lawyer who has played the part of loyal lieutenant to near perfection, was a leading figure in the referendum campaign and has high public approval ratings.
An advantage Ms Sturgeon enjoys over her boss is that she is a less divisive figure. Although Mr Salmond’s personal popularity exceeds that of other Scottish politicians, he registers negative ratings on issues such as trust.
“I’ve no doubt it will be Nicola Sturgeon – the only question is who will fill her position,” Gordon Wilson, a former SNP leader, told the BBC.
Mr Salmond’s announcement prompted immediate tributes from his political rivals – some of whom may have been cheered by the impending departure from the political front line of a man who was for decades a thorn in the side of the Westminster establishment.
Ed Miliband, UK Labour leader, praised him as formidable in standing up for his beliefs. David Cameron, UK prime minister hailed his “huge talent and passion”.
Speaking before Mr Salmond’s announcement, Michael Keating, professor of politics at Aberdeen university, said that if he did decide to step down it would be as the SNP’s most successful leader rather than as a humbled one.
“The SNP is extremely cohesive, they are still in power and they have a very good prospect of winning the next Scottish election,” Prof Keating said.
While the referendum defeat left many Yes campaigners disappointed to the point of near despair, SNP veterans said the fact that support for independence fell just 5 percentage points short of a majority was a stunning achievement. In the past support for leaving the UK has usually run at around a third or less of Scottish voters.
“If you had offered me 45 per cent six weeks ago . . . I would bitten your right and left hands off, plus your arms and most of your shoulder,” says Andrew Wilson, Nationalist columnist and former member of the Scottish parliament.
Yet even the highly assured Ms Sturgeon, whose politics lie on the left of the SNP’s broad political spectrum, may struggle to have the impact of her current boss, who has led the SNP in two stints for a total of 20 years and is widely considered one of the most accomplished politicians of his generation.

International cash spurs UK property boomInternational capital drives up demand and price for UK property
By Kate Allen
©Getty
Wanda is putting the first group of homes in its Vauxhall development, in Nine Elms, up for sale this week
The commercial property market is booming. Annual investment in UK property hit £42bn in the first quarter of 2014, the highest level seen since the height of the last peak in late 2007, according to figures from Real Capital Analytics, a research firm.
A number of factors are behind this, not least the fact that investors seem besotted for now with London property. The low interest rate environment created by quantitative easing coupled with low returns on both equities and bonds has seen investors scramble to find new sources of yield. Property looks like a good bet – and the UK is politically stable, its economy is recovering and its capital, London, is a truly global city. As a result, internationally mobile capital is pouring in.
More
Interview: Mark Preston, group chief executive Grosvenor Estate
Sovereign wealth funds are battling institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, for the capital’s commercial property , driving prices ever higher.
Asset prices are up 11 per cent year on year, according to Real Capital Analytics/Property Data, while yields have been falling sharply.
More than three-quarters of the money spent in the London market in the first three months of this year came from international buyers, according to figures from Cushman & Wakefield.
But even with the buoyant market, a handful of purchases have stood out.
The Indian property company Lodha’s £300m purchase last year of the Canadian embassy building on Grosvenor Square, and Chinese developer Greenland’s acquisition of the Ram Brewery site in Wandsworth, south London, for £600m both raised eyebrows among seasoned property watchers.
At the turn of the year, two record-breaking transactions took place which further exemplified the trend: Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC bought a 50 per cent stake in the Broadgate office complex for £1.7bn; and Kuwaiti property company St Martins spent a similar amount to acquire the More London estate. Both were record-breaking prices for the London market.
We seem to be in the middle of a sellers’ market.
Indeed, some of Britain’s most experienced property investors are seizing the moment to shed assets and free up cash. The big listed companies – real estate investment trusts such as British Land and Land Securities – have shifted to become net sellers in the past six to 12 months, for the first time since 2009.
So is it a case of buyer beware? When the locals are selling for very healthy profits, is it time to exercise more caution? Less experienced buyers coupled with more experienced sellers are, in any investment market, generally a good sign that a certain point in the asset pricing cycle has been reached. The question being asked now, is whether the market has reached its peak – or has further to go.
Are buyers being driven into making overly optimistic bids by the weight of money in their pocket? The renewed rhetoric from analysts with very short memories that “the only way is up” only adds to the property fever.
Arguments such as “this is the new normal” always give cause for concern.
There is, however, a way to explain why companies are still in the market to buy.
First, they evaluate investment performance over much longer timescales than most domestic investors. An institutional investor is looking for long-term, stable, ideally inflation-linked returns that most closely match their liabilities – and these could stretch for 40 years or more.
A building whose price is based on a 10- or 15-year returns model can look cheap to a buyer with a 40-year perspective.
Second, there is the currency aspect. The devaluation of sterling since the global economic crisis has not only seen British exports become more competitive – it has also made British property cheaper. Buyers whose investment model is priced in Singapore or Hong Kong dollars, for example, have found even iconic London trophy assets surprisingly affordable.
And finally, on the question of sustainability: as the middle classes in the emerging markets continue to grow, the weight of savings in their home markets is likely to continue to spill out across the globe in search of investment opportunities.
What implications does this have for demand?
Last year, China doubled the proportion of international investment it permits to be placed in property – but that still only represents 2 per cent of the total. That figure alone suggests that the tidal wave of cash flowing into property assets around the globe is unlikely to recede in the coming years.

About loveless marriagesUddhav chose to ignore the “Narendra Modi wave” that had won the alliance 42 out of 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state, never mind if the BJP felt “insulted “ by his attitude. (Source: PTI)
Written by P Vaidyanathan Iyer | Posted: September 20, 2014 2:22 am | Updated: September 20, 2014 2:30 am
In the last month or so, the cadres of the four parties that make up Maharashtra’s two long-standing coalitions — the Shiv Sena-BJP and the Congress-NCP — have shown growing support for the idea of a split. Each party seems keen to chart its own course in the state. While this could alter the nature of the state’s politics, this posturing is largely bravado in the run up to the assembly elections, less than a month away. It can only damage the prospects of all parties. This is especially significant for the Congress and the BJP. Given the results of the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP sees these polls as its best chance to come back to power in the state. But it cannot afford to contest on its own. The Congress, on the other hand, cannot risk repeating its Lok Sabha debacle in Maharashtra. The fundamentals of coalition politics and realpolitik will not allow the two alliances to split easily, even if they indulge in brinkmanship today.
Let us try to understand the reasons behind the sudden clamour for a split. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray does not go thunderously on the offensive like his late father, Balasaheb Thackeray. His version of the so-called Sena aggression was not to respond to the BJP state leadership’s demands on seat sharing till late on Thursday. He stuck to his final offer to the BJP — 119 seats out of a total of 288 in the state legislative assembly. Uddhav chose to ignore the “Narendra Modi wave” that had won the alliance 42 out of 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state, never mind if the BJP felt “insulted “ by his attitude. He was also emboldened by the results of the Uttar Pradesh bypolls, in which the BJP got a drubbing. The BJP, for its part, feels it has had enough. And it is true that when a party does not field a candidate in a particular seat for 20-25 years, its presence and clout diminishes. Moreover, its loyal cadres do not have much to look forward to, since coalition dharma dictates that the party cannot contest seats allotted to its partner. This perhaps rankles even more because the BJP had a better strike rate than the Sena in the Lok Sabha polls — 23 out of 26 seats compared to the Sena’s 18 out of 22.
It is the Congress-NCP camp that is keenly waiting for the news of a Sena-BJP split. This would allow it greater flexibility in choosing post-poll partners. Within the Congress-NCP alliance, demands continued…

DRDO’s Naval wing developing stealth technologies
All Indian naval ships will have stealth features in future and some of the designs have already been incorporated in the existing platforms, according to V. Bhujanga Rao, Director-General (Naval Systems and Materials), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
He said DRDO labs have the capability to design and develop stealth technologies for the naval vessels. While the Naval Science and Technological Laboratory (NSTL), Visakhapatnam was the lead facility, other labs like the Naval Materials Research Laboratory (NMRL) and the Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory (NPOL) were also contributing towards this end.
Dr. Rao said there was a difference in designing stealth features for a ship as opposed to that for an aircraft. While the main focus would be in reducing infra-red and radar cross section signatures for an aircraft, many other aspects have to be dealt with while making “silent ships.” Besides infra-red and radar, the signatures of acoustics, magnetic, electric and hydro-dynamic wake have to be minimised.
For miles together hydro-dynamic wake would give “tell-tale” signal that something was lurking, he added. Signature management was itself a concept which includes shaping of a ship to the lowest signature. There would be more stealth characteristics in over-the-deck portion as lot of metallic components get replaced by composites. The exhaust too would be at the minimal level.
“We have done some work on all these things. Ours is quite silent (stealth technology) and good enough to handle our enemies,” Dr. Rao said.
Under-water weapons
All future designs of the ships like corvettes, frigates and submarines would be incorporated with stealth features. He said that besides developing stealth platforms, the DRDO labs were working on under-water weapons, decoys, mines as also design of warships and submersibles. As regards underwater weapons, light weight torpedoes were already given to the Navy. Another advanced torpedo, ‘Varunastra’ would be delivered to the Navy by the year-end or early next year.
Also an advanced version of decoy named ‘Mareecha’ has already been tested in real conditions and had proved quite effective. “We are trying to hand it over to the Navy by year end,” he said. The decoys were meant to confuse enemy torpedoes.
Newly designed state-of-the-art underwater mines were under production by KELTRON. The underwater mines are used to lay minefields and obstruct the movement of enemy ships during hostilities.

Fifth Column: Wasting a mandateIn the first hundred days of the Modi government, what has changed is the country’s mood.
Written by Tavleen Singh | Posted: September 21, 2014 12:06 am
Three words that should worry the Prime Minister more than the bad by-election results are: nothing has changed. I hear them everywhere and most of all from businessmen who have been Narendra Modi’s biggest supporters ever since he first showed that Gujarat welcomed investment. So, when he now says the same thing for India and announces that there will be a ‘red carpet’ instead of ‘red tape’, why are they not convinced? Well, because nothing has changed. Not even the bad laws and policies that brought India to her knees and halved the growth rate in the last three years of the Sonia-Manmohan ‘welfare state’.
Here is a short list of policies that should already have been thrown into history’s dustbin. The retroactive tax. Tax terrorism. The land acquisition law. The companies Act. And visa restrictions that make it impossible for foreign travellers to enter India more than once in two months. This illogical restriction was imposed with David Headley in mind but without noticing that most jihadi terrorists come to India without visas.
The Finance Minister admitted at a recent Indian Express Adda that the land acquisition law made land acquisition impossible even for defence purposes. But the government seems to have no intention of making major changes without a “consensus”. Why? The BJP has the first full mandate to rule in 30 years. Would it not be simpler to admit that under the Sonia-Manmohan government, the BJP wrongly supported a lot of very bad laws because of their populist nature, and that it is time to rid India of them? My knowledge of the new companies law is limited, but those who are affected by it tell me that it allows so much government interference in routine business that it makes doing business very difficult.
While the Prime Minister talks about “minimum government”, his ministers seem not to have understood what this means. So his Minister for Human Resource Development has encouraged the UGC, which is the Planning Commission of higher education, to meddle in matters that should be the business of university officials. The minister herself shows no sign that she understands that she needs to dismantle a licence raj, not impose it more strictly.
On a daily basis, ministers handling vital economic portfolios speak of more controls and regulations. They appear to have forgotten that Modi managed to get a full mandate because people want change, not continuity. And because ordinary Indians believed that he would bring back investors and revitalise a job market that dried up in recent years because of vindictive, ill-conceived polices and laws. In the first hundred days of the Modi government, what has changed is the country’s mood. But economies do not grow on optimism and good intentions, they grow from good policies. Of these there are few signs.
The Environment Minister has been generous with handing out permissions continued…

From the Discomfort Zone: Japanese miniaturisation = human cocooningJapan, war-torn and labelled “bad” quality, had the guts to enter the US, challenging its gigantic car culture by offering a small car.
Written by Shombit Sengupta | Posted: September 21, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: September 21, 2014 12:08 am
Japan was known for shoddy products before 1950. Humiliation from the World War II defeat, accompanied by atomic devastation, made them determined to beat the West. Rising from wartime ashes, the Japanese performed the post-war economic “miracle” from 1950 to 1960 to become the world’s second-most powerful economy in less than a decade.
It was a collective national willingness to change the quality perception and reality of Japanese products. They understood then that claiming to be inventors may not be their route. Instead, they paid attention on how to adapt European and American invention in a different scale of aspiration to surpass the global customer’s expectation. From being fancy, but tacky, and of flimsy quality, Japanese products have since become the world’s benchmark in quality.
In one of my several visits to Japan on work, I got hungry seeing a Yakitori restaurant signboard in the heart of Tokyo’s commercial district. I followed its directional arrow through a narrow staircase to the first floor. The restaurant chef was cooking healthy, delicious, hot food surrounded on three sides by customers sitting on bar stools. Behind them were small tables stuck to the wall filled with people, but nothing looked overcrowded. The condiments the chef needed were in a glass case behind him and neatly arranged below that were raw ingredients frequently replenished. Even if you don’t speak Japanese it’s not a problem. Every dish was communicated with beautiful detailed pictures. The Japanese menu was translated into English in small letters.
Between two persons sitting at the bar, or at small tables, is a set of interconnected sauce and spice bottles that fit into a wedged carrier.
Every tiny bottle has puzzle designs on it. When I asked the chef about these designs, he explained how they serve functionality. You can’t place the bottles anywhere you want,as the design integrates them into their carrier. It’s the best time, space and convenience management crockery I’ve seen. Guests get attracted to it, play with it and arrange it correctly. They never keep any bottle outside the carrier. That saves the waiter’s time and looks neat. From procurement of raw products, to servicing crockery, sealed wet napkins to multiple usage of the arranged sauce carrier, there’s no wastage of time or space in the 700 sq ft that’s considered among the best Yakitori restaurants in Tokyo. This is unique miniaturisation in gastronomy. Having experienced the elaborate, regal way the French come up with delicious food served in a sophisticated manner, this miniaturisation was incredible. The comparison with gigantic American restaurants and serving portions also instantly hit me head on.

Out of my mind: On being 64The rise of Dalit and OBC parties during the past 25 years attests to the failure of the upper-caste elitism of the Congress, dressed as it was in socialist garb.

Power, Lord Acton said, tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely. Even the 100 days of power have gone to the heads of BJP activists. The decisive majority delivered by Narendra Modi was taken to be due to themselves and also seen as a vindication of their sectarian beliefs rather than what he actually said during the campaign.
Thus, the usual misbehaviour followed. Blatant anti-Muslim sentiments expressed in intolerant terms such as ‘love jihad’. Obviously the object of protection are ‘our girls’, seduced by ‘those horrible’ Muslim boys and converted. Our boys may marry ‘their girls’ forcibly, or not, but that is not the issue. Lies can be concocted once again about cow slaughter and export of beef by Muslim businesses, even by a minister. Madrasas, yet again, have become schools of terrorism. Goan Christians were told to declare themselves Hindus.
Luckily the Indian voters proved sensible. In Uttar Pradesh, they threw out the hatemongers. Within the honeymoon period, the BJP has got a wake-up call. People elected Modi because his message was positive and inclusive. They did not vote for the BJP even though that’s what the RSS may think. Voters were fed up with the corruption, incompetence and arrogance of the Congress. They were in despair about inflation, low growth and rampant unemployment. The issue was not Hindu identity or Muslim loyalties. They voted for good governance, not ideological poison.
The Prime Minister has acquired a formidable reputation of keeping his Cabinet under surveillance. There are stories, perhaps apocryphal, about him calling up ministers over their informal attire or for having coffee with businessmen in five-star hotels. It is time for him to say, without any ifs or buts, that he will have nothing to do with such misbehaviour. He wants to deliver growth, jobs and a high place for India in the global competition. He needs at least 10 years to do this. He requires a party which will become an inclusive nationalist party on the right of the political spectrum. This is what we were told he achieved in Gujarat by marginalising the VHP and RSS.
This will not be easy. Indeed it will be a distraction from his main job. He may not have many friends within the leadership of the BJP. But even so, the cost of not doing so will be large. Already it is not clear if the BJP and Shiv Sena will combine. Even if they do, it’s not clear if they can win convincingly in Maharashtra.
Incumbency did not matter in UP in the by-elections. Prithviraj Chavan may not be loved by his party, but he has a clean reputation among all the Congress chief ministers who have ruled Maharashtra. The Sena will, no doubt, play its communal card and even worse, its anti-Indian (except the Marathi manoos) message.
Modi saw, long before his party did, that Hindu majoritarianism is not an election-winning idea. Hinduism may be tolerant, but Hindu society is full of divisions by jaati.
The rise of Dalit and OBC parties during the past 25 years attests to the failure of the upper-caste elitism of the Congress, dressed as it was in socialist garb.
Mohan Bhagwat, as the chief ideologue of the RSS, revealed the embarrassment of the Hindu Rashtrawadis about this oppression recently in Delhi. He implied that the oppressed jaatis had voluntarily submitted to this oppression as they wanted to exhibit solidarity with their high-caste oppressors during slavery under Muslim rule. As distortions of history go, this must take the cake. But it shows that Hindu Rashtrawadis know that Hindu majoritarianism is a mirage. One can only be grateful for that.
Great political leaders have often built new coalitions and restructured their parties. Franklin D Roosevelt recruited African Americans to the Democratic Party despite their historical allegiance to Republicans — Abraham Lincoln’s party. Margaret Thatcher stole the working class vote from the Labour Party. Tony Blair in his turn brought back that vote and captured the middle-class suburban vote from the Tories.
Sixty-four is a good age to become a  revolutionary. Modi owes it to himself and indeed to India to succeed. Despite the recent upset, there is a vacuum on the Opposition front. If Modi fails, the alternatives will be anarchic. Happy belated birthday greetings.

Flip Side: Tongue twistersPrint
Written by Dilip Bobb | Posted: September 21, 2014 12:07 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi loves to dress up; in sartorial terms as well as his personally-patented language of politics and statecraft. He clearly loves acronyms, wordplay and numbers, starting his stewardship with promises of 5Cs, the P4 governance model, the 3Ss that India needs to speed up on and even the 3Ds in case any alphabets were feeling neglected. In Bhutan, it was B4B, in Nepal, HIT, in Japan it was ‘You Mori, me Modi’, and now the Chinese visit has given his linguistic talent new wings. Catchy phrases can also be tricky because they can catch you out later. Some examples.
Inch: His carefully composed acronym for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit, expanded as Inch Towards Miles. But the Chinese army seems to be taking it quite literally, occupying areas miles inside Indian territory and not giving an inch even as Xi and Modi were bonding over bhakri. Officially, the visit was labelled a success, but the incursion was akin to a stab in the back and bordered on an affront. Or, as Confucius is said to have said: ‘He who pampers the cow gets spoiled milk’.
Jinping the gun: On the eve of Xi’s visit, there was much talk of the Chinese investing $100 billion in India. By the end of the talks, the total investment was $20 billion, or one-fifth of the original figure, which left everyone wondering about the missing billions. Chinese checkers? Or, more appropriately, Peking Duck. Curiously, the origin of the $100 billion figure remained a Chinese puzzle, leaving everyone confused about who had been jinping the gun.
Cheeni come: Speaking to the Chinese media on the eve of the visit, Modi did some sugarcoating on Sino-Indian historical ties, saying “it was because of Chinese technology that we were able to refine the sugar, which is why the people of India started calling sugar cheeni”.
He should have asked Indians manufacturers, of Sivakasi firecrackers to Benarasi saris, mobile phones, toys, furniture and fake couture, who have been pleading with the government saying “Chini cum”.
Dhokla diplomacy: Another catchphrase that caught on when Xi touched down in Ahmedabad and was treated to some Gujarati delicacies by Modi. It was actually a snide remark by a Congress party spokesman and a reference to the BJP’s taunt during UPA II, when it had coined the phrase ‘biryani diplomacy’ to suggest India was being soft on Pakistan. The Congress dig was in the context of the timing of the Ladakh incursion. In terms of heated culinary exchanges, as far as the Chinese are concerned, they have never forgiven India for having invented Chicken Manchurian. And putting it on the menu at Moti Mahal.
Soft power: If improving ties was part of the script, then the sight of Xi humming along to a rendition of Raj Kapoor’s Awaara hoon suggests that soft power is an effective medium, border violations and India’s soft stand notwithstanding. After all, the most popular Chinese dish in India is sweet and sour chicken.
The 3Ds: Originally, Modi’s sweetener to Japanese investors was to emphasise 3Ds — democracy, demography and demand. In one sense, he was right. Demand in India is shooting up, as in the Shiv Sena rejecting the BJP’s demand for 135 seats, offering just 119, and the demand by Ajit Singh to remain, rent-free, at his Lutyens bungalow, even though his party was wiped out in the last elections. Singh must be going by another Confucius saying, ‘A naked man has no fear of his pocket getting picked’.

Champions League T20 — Kane Williamson's dashing 101* help Northern Knights beat Cape Cobras by 33 runs (D/L method).

Kane Williamson - man on fire. Photo by: Pal Pillai/ Sportzpics/CLT20Northern Knights 206 for 5 (Williamson 101*, Devcich 67) beat Cobras 44 for 2 by 33 runs (D/L method)
Scorecard and ball-by-ball details
In most Twenty20 matches, the brevity of the format allows teams a chance to mount a comeback even if the scorecard makes for grim reading. This did not seem like one of those matches. Kane Williamson showed off his increasing proficiency in the format with a maiden T20 century to lead Northern Knights to their highest score, and Trent Boult and Tim Southee underlined their customary threat with the new ball to leave Cobras on the mat. By the time the rain came down in the eighth over of the chase, the asking rate was nearing 13 and saved Cobras from what was shaping to be an hour of minimising the margin of defeat.
At the start of the year, Williamson was not seen as someone who could play Twenty20s. Everything about him seemed old-school, from the manner in which he batted - lacking the glamorous mega hits the fans and the format loves - to the way in which he celebrated his centuries - with a mild wave of the bat. He hadn't played a single game in the format in all of 2013.
In 2014, though, he has been immense in Twenty20s, averaging over 40, striking at 137, and almost doubling his aggregate in the format. In Raipur, he showed how versatile his game is. His first 15 runs all came behind the wicket as he used the pace of the bowlers. He picked off four successive twos in the fourth over, nudging the ball in the gaps and running hard to signal a shift in momentum after a tight start from Cobras bowlers.
There had been plenty of close calls for both him and opening partner Anton Devcich early on: in the first over itself, there was a mix-up and Williamson was nearly run-out; in the second, there was an unintentional four for him to third man as he was late in leaving the ball; in the third, Devcich just beat the throw from point; in the fourth, a Williamson top edge flew for six over fine leg; in the fifth, Devcich was reprieved at short fine leg by Justin Kemp , who hurt his hand attempting a low catch.
Williamson and Devcich capitalised on that fortune to build a 140-run stand at more than 10 an over. Williamson was superb at placing the ball behind the stumps, and used the inside-out chip to good effect, while Devcich unveiled a series of sweeps and reverse-sweeps. The acceleration came in the middle of the innings, with 74 runs arriving in a five-over spell - there was also a 37-ball sequence in which there was only one dot delivery. The next scoreless ball was in the 14th over when Devcich was run out.
Daniel Flynn followed for a duck, but BJ Watling kept the frenetic pace up with a 20-ball cameo in which he feasted on Kemp. Williamson was muscling the ball around by this stage, including a powerful hit to cow corner for six off Rory Kleinveldt .
Charl Langeveldt , who hasn't played a competitive game in nearly a year, delivered several yorkers to stifle the runs and for a brief while it seemed as though Williamson might struggle to reach his hundred. He got there in grand style, though, with a stunning shot that sailed over cover for six even though he was flopping over towards the leg side. That also took Knights beyond 200, to a score that looked beyond Cobras' reach.
A full-strength Cobras line-up would have had Dale Steyn , Sunil Narine and the Ram Slam's most successive bowler, Beuran Hendricks. Instead, a severely weakened Cobras were taken apart by a team that had already played three matches at the same venue.

By Mike Collett
LONDON (Reuters) - Frank Lampard, Chelsea's all-time record scorer, came on as a late substitute for Manchester City and scored their equaliser in a 1-1 draw at the Etihad as the champions ended his former club's perfect start to the Premier League season on Sunday.
Lampard, who scored 211 goals for Chelsea and is on loan at City from MLS side New York City, scored in the 85th minute after only six minutes on the pitch.
Andre Schuerrle had put league leaders Chelsea ahead in the 71st minute, five minutes after City defender Pablo Zabaleta had been sent off for fouling Diego Costa.
Lampard, third on Chelsea's all-time appearance list as well as scoring more goals for the club than anyone else, did not celebrate the goal which ended Chelsea's perfect start to the season although they stayed three points clear at the top with 13 points from their first five matches.
"It's a really difficult one. I'd be unprofessional if I came on and didn't do my job so I'm mixed with it," he told Sky Sports.
"I'm obviously pleased that the side I came on for got a draw. It's come up, I'm a professional and I didn't expect to come on and score. I'm stuck in the middle.
"The Chelsea fans were singing my name and it was an emotional day. It's not how I expected to say goodbye to the Chelsea fans. I woke up this morning and didn't know what I wanted from today so I'm glad it's out of the way. I guess this is a happy medium."
The result left Manchester City in sixth place on eight points, and their draw meant they had a better day than their arch-rivals Manchester United, involved in one of the most astonishing Premier League matches for years.
They were twice two goals ahead at Leicester first by 2-0 and then 3-1 with 33 minutes left, but Leicester came back to win 5-3 for their first league win over United since 1998.
Leicester were one of three surprise winners with West Bromwich Albion climbing off the bottom of the table with a 1-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur, their first league win of the season.
Crystal Palace came from behind to win 3-2 at Everton in their first victory of the league campaign.

Automakers follow BOT model to improve profitsSave precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Automakers are working out new ways of production to beat inventory blues. Plagued by a prolonged sluggish demand, which has kept the market subdued for over two years, some of them have now started following the 'built-to-order' (BOT) model to improve profits during hard times.
Commercial vehicle-maker Ashok Leyland has adopted the BOT format for its newly launched truck models Boss and Captain and is rolling out vehicles from its Pantnagar plant based on demand. "We started the concept a few months ago to switch over to a more efficient system, which we call 'made to stock'," said managing director Vinod K Dasari, confirming the new production system. "It has helped us reduce our inventory" at a time when the commercial vehicle market was passing through one of its worst times, he said.
The weak Indian commercial vehicle market — sales have fallen year-overyear every month for two-and-half years — has forced manufacturers to switch to more efficient modes to reduce costs. Commercial vehicle-makers such as Tata Motors and Eicher Motors said they have also restructured manufacturing practices.
According to experts and automotive analysts, more and more companies are resorting to the BOT format, where they are manufacturing variants of vehicles based on confirmed bookings. "This practice helps the OEMs in minimising the inventory while focusing on the real product mix. This approach is considered for highly configured products such as automobiles," said Amit Kaushik, principal analyst , autos, at consultancy firm IHS Automotive.
Maruti Suzuki had started the practice long ago for its solitary sport-utility vehicle Gypsy which was made at its Gurgaon plant. The company manufacturers the SUV only after confirmed bookings from customers who also need to make a hefty deposit. "We are making Gypsy off-line. It basically means that it is produced on confirmed orders," said a senior executive .
Honda Cars India is believed to have switched over to the BOT format for its CR-V, with demand for the SUV not so high in India. It has sold just 322 units this fiscal year. The company has kept the model off-line as it used its production lines to make the highly popular City and Amaze sedans, which form around 70% of its sales in India.

AIs insurance up for renewal for an estimat...Air India’s insurance contract up for renewal on October 1 for an estimated $25 million

(Air India’s current insurance…)
MUMBAI: The race for Air India's insurance account is boiling down to a contest between the public and private sector. A consortium of state-owned insurers led, by New India Assurance, has emerged as the frontrunner for the national carrier's business, while the private sector has rallied behind a group led by ICICI Lombard General Insurance. The insurance contract for the flag carrier's 105-strong fleet comes up for renewal on October 1 at an estimated premium of about $25 million.
Experts said the New India Assuranceled consortium has United India Insurance, Oriental Insurance and National Insurance as co-insurers. The other group has ICICI Lombard General Insurance as lead insurer and Reliance General and HDFC Ergo as co-insurers.
The insurance companies ET spoke with on the matter declined to comment. However, a senior executive at a staterun insurer said the New India Assurance-led consortium was ahead in the race.
According to industry executives, aviation premiums have increased following arise in mishaps, pushing up the bill for insurers. For instance, in 2013 when the market had softened, Air India paid a premium of $23 million. This was lower by over $1 million than the premium in 2010 when an Air India Express jet crashed in Mangalore killing 158 people.
General insurers led by Reliance General that had provided cover to Air India in 2010 had to pay Rs 350-400 crore in compensation claims. Most of the claim money came from international reinsurers who dictate rates depending on the state of the market.
Air India's current insurance policy, issued by New India Assurance, includes a $9.5-billion hull cover and a combined single liability of $1.5 billion.
Hull all-risk insurance covers any damage to the body of the aircraft caused by an accident, while war risk, part of hull cover, insures against war, invasion, insurrection, rebellion and hijacking. In addition, the insurance covers liability toward passengers and covers legal protection against suits.
A series of aviation disasters this year—the disappearance of a Malaysian Airlines jetliner in March, the crash of a Malaysian Airlines aircraft in Ukraine in July and that of an Air Algeria plane in Mali in the same month—have turned aviation insurers wary.

Hurricanes  Blizzard blow away CobrasTweet
0
Hobart Hurricanes 186 for 4 (Blizzard 78*, Dunk 54, Engelbrecht 3-20) beat Cape Cobras 184 for 6 (Levi 42, Philander 32*) by six wickets
Scorecard and ball-by-ball details
Blizzard: 78 off 48 balls.The romance of T20 cricket is that one ball can change the game. Cobras were reminded of it in gruesome fashion in the 18th over. Their lead bowler Vernon Philander had routed Hobart Hurricanes' final hope when he had Aiden Blizzard caught on the long-on boundary, and it did not augur well for the chase that a new batsman had to come in with an equation of 38 off 17 balls. Blizzard was walking off the field when he was asked to wait; the umpires wanted to double-check the legality of the ball. The replay gutted Cobras - Philander had overstepped.
Blizzard had reached his fifty off the previous delivery, and he feasted on the free-hit - that monstrous six over square leg was part of a 24-run over. A match that had slowly been tipping into the Cobras' hands was wrested away and Hurricanes hurtled to victory with one over to spare.
Philander was completely thrown. He dished out length balls and worse full tosses to be carted for two fours and two sixes in seven deliveries. Philander had caused confusion among the Hurricanes' bowlers when Cobras batted, and had been a vital cog in a seventh-wicket partnership that razed 52 runs in four overs and inflated the target to 185. Memories of his 32 off 14 evaporated, however, as Blizzard reaped his luck to take 26 runs off eight balls to finish unbeaten on 78 off 48.
Both teams were pleased with the pitch at the start of the game. Hurricanes captain Tim Paine said it looked "terrific"; his Cobras counterpart Justin Ontong foresaw some turn and loaded his side with an extra spinner. Dane Piedt's impact was minimal though as he injured his right arm but the other change, Sybrand Engelbrecht, thrived. The slower he bowled, the more difficult it got for Hurricanes. By the end of Engelbrecht's spell - 4-0-20-3 - the equation was 60 off 30 balls. Charl Langeveldt , who reversed his retirement for this tournament, compounded that with a terrific 17th over that yielded only six runs - one of which was a tight wide call.
Blizzard was saddled with a required rate that was inching to 15. He had used pure power to fuel his innings and the ploy hadn't been as effective when the bowlers opted to change their pace. His tally against spin was 29 off 27. But the situation empowered him to continue and Cobras helped him by feeding him pace and worse, at the exact length a batsman would like. His innings overshadowed another half-century at the top of the order. Ben Dunk had accumulated 41 of the 51-run opening stand.
At that stage, the chase looked perfectly on course. Cobras' 62 runs in their Powerplay was the best in this CLT20. Hurricanes missed that by only three runs. Cobras edged ahead during a tight middle-overs period in the Hurricanes' innings - only 47 runs came between the ninth and the 15th and there were three wickets as well.
But in the end they were disconsolate and in disbelief. They were still without points despite a blitz from Richard Levi , who offset the early dismissal of Hashim Amla with a typically muscular 42 off 30. The Hurricanes' bowlers took their time recognising the impact of changing their pace. They had tested the pitch with Xavier Doherty in the third over. In the fifth, he beat Levi's outside edge but the batsman hit back with two successive fours.
Eventually they caught on with Ben Laughlin showing off different variations of his slower ball to pick up 2 for 31. Levi's dismissal in the 10th over helped, but just as the innings seemed to be meandering, Robin Peterson 's unorthodoxy and Philander peppering the straight boundary revived them. However, Philander's luck ran out when it was time to bowl.

RBI cautions banks on misuse of Jan Dhan Yojana schemeRBI cautions banks on misuse of Jan Dhan Yojana scheme
PTI
Tweet
Kolkata, Sept 19:  
The Reserve Bank today warned the banks to be more careful while opening accounts under the Jan Dhan Yojana, saying that a single individual could open multiple accounts in the lure of Rs 1 lakh insurance cover.
“There are some caveats when the banks are implementing the financial inclusion scheme under the recently launched Jan Dhan programme,” RBI Executive Director P Vijay Bhaskar said at a CII seminar here today.
He said people could open accounts in different banks using different identity documents like PAN card, Aadhar among others in the lure of getting insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh from all the banks.
The banks should have a single information sharing system by which this possible misuse could be stopped.
Another possible threat was ‘smurfing’, the RBI official said.
In this case, hawala operators would split the whole amount into several small units beyond the threshold using several bank accounts and send money overseas.
The last was ‘money mules’ by which an individual would operate through another person’s bank account.
Talking about the north—eastern region, he said the SLBCs and the SLCCs should take steps to improve the credit—deposit ratio of the region as the CD ratio was much lower than the national average.
Earlier this week, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had cautioned banks on the risks involved in just hunting for numbers with regards to Jan Dhan scheme, asking them not to compromise on core objectives of the programme.
“When we roll out the scheme, we have to make sure it does not go off the track. The target is universality, not just speed and numbers,” Rajan had said.

Are We Building Too Many Single-Family Homes4674
4.2%
Note: total housing units and total households include mobile homes, boats, RV's, vans, etc. and their occupants.
Since the bubble, including in the most recent year from 2012 to 2013, the largest increase of any household type was for single-family rentals. In contrast, the number of single-family homes occupied by owners declined in absolute terms, not just as a share of households, both in the past year and since the bubble.
Strikingly, household formation -- the year-to-year change in total households -- was a meager 321,000 between 2012 and 2013. That's way below the 1.2 million household formation rate we'd expect given the growth in the adult population. (A separate estimate of household formation from other Census data released this week was similarly low.) Low household formation means less demand for new construction.
Multi-Unit Vacancies Down, But Single-Family Vacancies Up
The vacancy rates help us see whether construction is falling behind, keeping up with, or running too far ahead of household formation. For any housing type, the vacancy rate equals the percentage of units that are unoccupied. Unlike the "renter vacancy rate" and "homeowner vacancy rate" reported by the Census Bureau, our vacancy measure for each type -- single-family and multi-unit -- includes vacant homes held off the market, which is essential for understanding today's housing market. If you ignore vacant homes held off the market, it looks like there's a shortage of homes -- but in fact there's only an inventory shortage, not a national housing shortage . (See note.)
The multi-unit vacancy rate peaked at 17.2% in 2010 and has dropped steadily since then to 15.1% in 2013. Multi-unit buildings are leading the construction recovery , but demand for apartment rentals has been so strong that the multi-unit housing stock is filling up. Thus, the multi-unit vacancy rate has fallen, returning in 2013 almost to its 2005 level. That rate might start to level off as apartment buildings broke ground in 2013 reach completion in 2014 and add to the housing supply.
The single-family market tells a very different story. Even though single-family construction remains depressed compared with historical norms, the single-family vacancy rate is still high. It was 10.7% in 2013, ticking up from 10.6% in 2012, and close to its peak of 11.0% in 2011. That compares with 7.4% in the pre-bubble days of 2000.
For the single-family vacancy rate to move back down to bubble or pre-bubble levels, the growth in households occupying single-family homes needs to exceed the growth in the single-family housing stock. In other words, to get back to normal, we gotta fill up homes faster than we build them. That didn't happen in 2013. Even though relatively few single-family homes were built, even fewer were filled, despite the increase in single-family rentals.
It's worth noting that it matters where the vacant homes are. A high vacancy rate might not imply less need for construction provided that the vacancy rate is low in areas with strong population growth and housing demand. But that's in theory. In fact, it turns out that it isn't only economically struggling areas that have stubbornly high single-family vacancy rates. Many faster growing metros overbuilt during the bubble still have lots of vacant homes.
Wrapping up: Even though single-family construction is low by historical standards, it may still be running ahead of demand. (Note: corrected from original, which said "not running ahead.") If anything, we built slightly more single-family homes in 2013 than we filled. And on the flip side, apartments and condos are being snapped up, even though multi-unit construction has been chugging ahead of normal levels. For the housing market to get back in balance, multi-unit must continue to lead the construction recovery.
Notes: this post is based on American Community Survey tables B25024 and B25032 via FactFinder , 2005-2013.
The vacancy rates for single-family and multi-unit homes include seasonally vacant homes because, unfortunately ,the ACS does not break out vacancy type by "units in structure" (that is, single-family or multi-unit). However, the Quarterly Homeownership and Vacancy Survey (HVS) confirms that the share of vacant homes that are seasonally unoccupied remained relatively constant over this period.
Vacancy by "units in structure" is available in the ACS and in the 2000 Decennial Census, but not in the 2010 Decennial Census. So there's no way to compare Decennial and ACS estimates for these measures for the same year.
The "renter vacancy rate" and "homeowner vacancy rate," defined here , are used in many Census reports; however, they omit the high (40%) and growing share of vacant units held off the market. The HVS reports renter vacancy rate and homeowner vacancy rate by "units in structure," but excludes vacant homes held off the market.

What s Really Wrong With Speculationreddit
The word "speculator" has often been conflated with "entrepreneur," and both of them tarred with the brush of "con men."
However, there is a good connotation for entrepreneurs. They are viewed as risk-takes who create new products and businesses. Speculators are seen as risk-takers solely out to make money.
But is speculation really a bad thing? How do economists view speculators? Here's how one economist sees them.
Perry Mehrling's Money and Banking Class
Perry Mehrling , author of several books, the latest of which is The New Lombard Street, is professor of economics at Barnard College in Manhattan. Mehrling has been offering a free online course on money and banking .
His goal is to teach anyone at Barnard or elsewhere in the world how to read and understand the London Financial Times newspaper in its entirety.
This class is not like any other economics course you'll find. Mehrling crosses a divide that at my alma mater, The University of Wisconsin in Madison, was physical as well as curricular. On one side of the street was the economics building. On the other side was the department of finance. Never did students or faculty of either department cross that street.
But now there is Mehrling. His course seamlessly combines economics and finance. He offers video lectures, weekly discussions, quizzes, readings, and exams. You feel like you are back in college even if you're sitting at home, miles away from New York City.
Mehrling's underlying premise is that there is a "hierarchy of money" (gold, national currencies, bank deposits, and at the bottom -- securities, loans, and credit).
Different kinds of money and the relationships among them define each of our financial institutions.
For example here's how their balance sheets distinguish banks from shadow banks:
Mehrling shows the plus and minus action on each side of their balance sheets as the different parties interact with each other. Usually their transactions all cancel each other out (i.e., they balance) -- but not always.
For example, middlemen ("dealers") in foreign-exchange transactions make money on the interest rates and fees they charge while hedging against their own risk if a currency rate changes drastically. In this way currency exchange dealers help keep international business flowing.
But speculative dealers who hedge the currency dealer's bets take on the full risk - when they lose, speculative dealers have to eat their liabilities. They can't hedge their bets and pass on the risk they take - the buck stops with them. This is why they are called  "naked" speculators.
However, without naked speculators, the buck and every other country's currency wouldn't get exchanged. Matched-book dealers, those with balanced balance sheets, couldn't risk exchanging currencies. International trade could grind to a halt.
What's wrong with speculators?
As I understood Mehlring's lecture, AIG acted like a naked speculative dealer when it sold a 10 billion dollar CDS (credit default swap) to Goldman Sachs. That's because AIG carried no offsetting assets to hedge against this liability.
AIG was convinced this transaction with Goldman bore no risk to itself -- even as it guaranteed Goldman that it would pay the money in full if AIG's credit rating was lowered. And that is exactly what happened. Moody's lowered AIG's rating.
At the kick-off of the 2008 financial crisis AIG had to pay $10 billion to Goldman that it didn't really have. AIG's balance sheet didn't balance, and the Fed chose to bail out this deeply-indebted company. That was the start of massive bailouts by the Treasury Department .
In what sounds like a devil's bargain, Merhling suggests the way to take taxpayers off the hook for footing the bill for private banking is for the Fed to become a derivatives dealer itself and take the other side of the naked bets made by private derivatives speculators. This means the government would  become a "lender of last resort" for private dealers.
To deter private dealers from needing government loans to pay their bills on time, dealers, particularly naked speculative dealers, would be required to have adequate capital flows to fully absorb the losses they might incur.
Apparently, naked speculators are necessary to grease the wheels of business in a hybrid (private and public) monetary system like ours. But this means taxpayers remain at risk of paying dearly again if speculative dealers can't pay what they owe on time. Perhaps it's time to give Perry Mehrling's ideas some thought.

PM to unveil measures promising to ease doing biz in IndiaPM Modi to unveil government measures promising to ease doing business in India

(Prime minister Modi to unveil…)
New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to unveil measures highlighting his government's initiatives to make it easier to do business in India in his first major interaction with industry captains after assuming office. This effort forms an integral part of Modi's Make In India pitch aimed at altering the negative narrative of uncertainty and red-tapism that haunts the country's investment climate.
Among the big-ticket measures Modi is expected to flag at the September 25 event are the rationalisation of restrictive labour, environmental and foreign direct investment (FDI) norms that have deterred investment and job creation in recent years, besides the setting up of a fully functional single-window system for starting a business that would allow budding entrepreneurs to get more than 100 central and state government clearances online.
Ahead of Modi's public pitch to restore the faith of local and global investors in India's market opportunities, the environment ministry has decided to roll back what's said to be one of the biggest hurdles to fresh industrial investment in the last few years that required any factory or assembly line built on 20,000 square metres or more to secure environmental clearance for construction. India Inc had red-flagged this at meetings steered by the Prime Minister's Office, which is in mission mode as it looks to improve investment climate, having tasked different departments with specific action points.
Environment, forest & climate change minister Prakash Javadekar has approved a draft notification that explicitly keeps building of factories and industrial production facilities out of the ambit of 2006 environment impact assessment norms. This is likely to be notified by early November, officials said. Industry had told the PMO that the 20,000 sq m norm was meant to cover large township and housing construction projects, not the building of factories, but the previous UPA government had misinterpreted the clause in the last few years, introducing a delay of at least 24 months in building or commissioning any investment project planned over five acres or more.
"We have invited a large number of industry leaders across sectors, big, small and medium to the Make In India campaign launch by the PM at Vigyan Bhawan," said a senior government official. "The PM would make some important announcements, around the theme of ease of doing business," he said. India is ranked 134th out of 189 countries on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index.
Representatives of several global businesses and business groups and economic or commercial counsellors of several foreign governments will also attend the event.
Indian embassies across the world are expected to play a proactive role in propagating the Make In India mission, while the external affairs and industry ministries have been asked to work closely with states in organising road shows for global investors and hand-holding them through the process of setting up shop in the country.
Aimed at introducing transparency and efficiency in the myriad clearances required for business, the new single-window system involves digitizing more than 100 central and state-level approvals ranging from registering a boiler or getting a fire department clearance to getting a PAN and other tax identification numbers. The government is striving to make this operational by March 2015.
"The environment ministry is examining a recommendation to do away with the existing categories of projects into categories A and B (which determines if a project needs a green clearance from the Centre or state) and relax the norms that require an environmental impact assessment and public hearings even for expansion projects," said a senior government official aware of the development.
The ministry is also looking at relaxing conditions related to the distance of the project from state boundaries and critically polluted areas, he said, adding that these changes were recommended by a panel led by the director of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI).
The panel was appointed by former environment minister in the UPA government Jayanthi Natarajan, who allegedly delayed projects worth lakhs of crores by withholding green clearances, prompting Modi to coin the term 'Jayanthi tax' during the Lok Sabha poll campaign. Natarajan had kept the constitution of the committee and its terms of reference out of the public domain, although it submitted its report to her successor Veerappa Moily this May. Natarajan had rejected Modi's characterisation.

Govt boosts confidence: NRIs make bulk purchases anticipating realty revivalAssocham
(Property markets in Bangalore, Ahmedabad and…)
MUMBAI | KOLKATA: Vinisha Khiara and her husband Gautam, hoteliers in the UAE, already own an apartment in their hometown Mumbai and are keen to invest in properties in India that would fetch them handsome return on investment (RoI) five years from now.
The enterprising couple, after some good research and bargaining, recently picked up three apartments in Bangalore. "Bulk investment offered us a good bargain along with one-time registration process and will also help in easy monitoring of properties going forward," says Vinisha. NRIs who have so far shown interest in buying properties in overseas markets, are now keen to invest in Indian real estate. They are making bulk purchases, getting decent discounts, and expecting good returns in anticipation of a revival in the market.
Property markets in Bangalore, Ahmedabad and outskirts of Mumbai, including Ambernath and Navi Mumbai , are generating good interest among buyers in the UAE, Singapore, the US and Canada .
Bulk buying is clearly helping both sides here as NRIs are getting discounts while developers, the much-needed liquidity. "For the buyer, a bulk purchase offers better discounts along with payment flexibility. Bulk buying or group purchase is always a welcome proposition for developers. Among the main reasons for that is the reduction in the cost of acquisition. Bulk buying helps increase turnover. More importantly, it helps timely execution of projects as cash flows are unhindered," says Jackbastian Nazareth, Group CEO at Puravankara Projects. "A depreciating rupee has also made properties in India cheaper for NRIs," he adds.
According to a recent Assocham survey, Indian property developers are anticipating a 35% rise in inquiries from NRIbased buyers against last year's about 18%.
"NRIs feel confident about the new government in India and are waiting for an investmentfriendly market in various fields," the study added. Sensing an opportunity of rising interest among NRIs to invest in Indian real estate, some developers have also set up exclusive sales offices in these regions.
"To tap the growing business opportunities from NRIs, we started an office in Dubai earlier this year. Given that our sales from the Dubai market alone have almost doubled, we are now looking at setting up offices in Singapore and Hong Kong in the next three months," says Gaurav Gupta, director of Omkar Realtors & Developers. The company has received 30 bookings from West Asia, mainly from Dubai in August alone.
With better sentiments, developers in markets like Bangalore, which is being seen as a most affordable one, have already started witnessing better sales from this segment. "Definitely yes, the interest from the NRI community is rising. Bookings by NRIs so far this year have already surpassed last year's number. Out of our total 82 bookings since April, around 25% have been from NRIs against 20% of last year's total sales," says Satish Shetty, head — Bangalore, Mittal Universal.
While there are NRIs who are buying properties in their respective hometowns due to emotional reasons, investors taking decisions based only on pure returns are also shifting their focus to India.
"With euphoria around the newly-elected Modi government , even hardcore NRI investors, who were so far investing in Central London and Manhattan, have started looking at Indian property markets," Gupta says. Despite the rupee's weakness against the US dollar , 2013 proved to be a lacklustre year for the realty sector, given that investor sentiment remained weak. However, post elections, the mood has turned optimistic, especially due to some announcements made by the government so far.
"This year (2014) has been significantly better and we are now close to achieving sales of 100,000 sq ft by December," says Shabeer Sait, executive head of operations at Irshads Property Matters that has major client base from overseas markets, mainly the UAE.
"With the announcement of 100 smart cities, hassle-free airports across tier-II cities to improve connectivity, etc., measures like these clearly show the government's intent on infrastructure push."
Among NRI investors, who are mostly the high-net worth types, professionals and industrialists, mid-segment projects are their favorites, while premium and high-end projects are being considered mostly for end-use, brokers say.

Colleges Dont Need More Tests or More "Sheep"reddit
You've probably heard the buzz around William Deresiewicz's polemic against the "miseducation of the American elite." In the most widely read article in the history of The New Republic, Deresiewicz lambasted Ivy League schools (and others) for attracting students who will do almost anything to build a résumé that will get them through the admissions filter, and then they wind up without a clue about how to pursue an education in college or how they might lead a meaningful life. Our most highly selective schools, he argues, have become "inimical to learning," training people who aspire to be both technocrats and aristocrats. They may talk about checking their privilege in undergraduate humanities courses, but they have been well trained to pursue paths only for the sake of prestige, power, and money. As one of Deresiewicz's student sources put it: "It's hard to build your soul when everyone around you is trying to sell theirs."
Deresiewicz offers a complaint about "those young people today" that many have dismissed as a familiar rant about youth culture by someone no longer part of it. The author evokes Allan Bloom, who provided a similar, if more deeply sourced, critique of education in The Closing of the American Mind (1987). Deresiewicz is surely right to complain about the rat race among ambitious high school students eager to do whatever it takes to get into a school with the most social prestige, without having to pay attention to how they want to learn or to what kind of learning context might be right for them. His comments on how bright and hardworking students enter the most selective schools with a wide variety of dreams about what they want to do after graduation, only to become more and more homogeneous by the time they graduate, are chilling. Look down the rows on graduation day at the most elite universities and colleges, Deresiewicz emphasizes, and two of three seniors are likely to aspire to being bankers or consultants. They just don't know what else to do, as they've been trained always to go for the biggest prize. They've been taught that what matters can be measured; money is easy to measure.
Many students have written to Deresiewicz with tales of similar high-achievement/low-meaning experiences. His work has certainly struck an important chord in a culture that seems bent on making education only a job-training program -- even for the most accomplished students. But there have also been biting critiques of his penchant for cherry-picking his facts, preaching to the elite's choir, and falling into embarrassing clichés. ("Have I mentioned that it isn't easy? It's not easy. It's never easy. Life is tragic, which means, among other things, that you can't have it all.") The New Republic has just published a stinging rejoinder from Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, who agrees that elite universities are paying attention to the wrong things in their holistic admissions processes. Pinker claims that less than 10 percent of the Harvard entering class is chosen just for academic aptitude, and he finds that scandalous. But he will have none of Deresiewicz's talk of a well-rounded, meaningful life. Pinker wants students who excel when tested; he wants students who can perform in the classroom. Not quite saying what academic aptitude is, he is sure Harvard should emphasize it to create a "true meritocracy." Many perversities would be eliminated, he insists, if we had more faith in standardized tests. Sure, they correlate with wealth, he opines, but perhaps aptitude does, as well. If we just focused on academic aptitude, he suggests, the professors would be well-served. Would the students? Would the culture that supports the university?
William Deresiewicz called his recent book Excellent Sheep because he thinks we have created a system in which young people are encouraged to conform, not to think. By getting students to become better test takers and résumé builders, he argues, we create people less capable of asking themselves questions that challenge the status quo -- we create people incapable of thinking against the grain. Pinker seems to think that really smart people will think against the grain because they will pursue information and argument wherever it might take them. Worry about academic aptitude, he suggests, and the soul will take care of itself. Columnist David Brooks sees the debate between Deresiewicz and Pinker at the heart of tensions over the role of college education today.
Deresiewicz mentions Wesleyan (where I am university president) and other liberal arts colleges as places in which very capable and creative students escape the herd mentality characteristic of the most elite institutions. Teaching thousands of students over the last few years at Wesleyan and other schools that emphasize liberal learning, I certainly see young people eager to question their own and other people's assumptions. At the best residential colleges and universities, I also see faculty and staff willing to engage in the "education of the whole person" and not just training for a specific task. There are herds everywhere, and I'm sure you can find them at some very fine schools, but in my work at and visits to liberal arts colleges, I haven't seen many sheep. I don't see many folks who have already made up their mind about what the rest of their lives will look like. Instead, I see staff members discovering new talents and finding ways to share them with others. I find faculty learning about their specific, specialized research areas, but also about the wider society and natural world. And I discover students with whom I can learn and who are eager to find meaning in their lives as well as skills with which to live.
Of course, even a university president must recognize that there are plenty of problems in American higher education. But we should beware of the facile tradition of criticizing colleges, professors, and the young (or just mocking them). This tradition goes back to the founding of our country, as I've recently shown in Beyond the University: Why Liberal Education Matters . Some, like Deresiewicz, have attacked student culture for not paying attention to what older folks know about "a meaningful life." Others, like both he and Pinker, have complained about the process of selection -- how could it be fair, inclusive, and still not offend? Taking potshots at admissions offices is so easy when you don't have to offer any ideas about putting together diverse cohorts of young people who can learn from each other.
Our colleges and universities aspire to help students to find what John Dewey called "the large and human significance" in their lives and work. This requires not just teaching to the test and not just parroting critiques. It requires learning to think with contexts and concepts, deploying cooperation and creativity. American higher education has much room for improvement, but our goal has served this country well: to help students develop the capacities and skills to reshape themselves and the world around them by learning to think for themselves and continually reinvent what they do.

The Big Chill Facing Frances JewsFrance's Jews have had enough.
Enough of public transportation systems on which it has become dangerous to wear a yarmulke.
Enough of public schools in which Jewish students are taunted as they leave class.
Enough of the France of the practitioners of the neo-Nazi salute known as the quenelle, whose meetings are little more than calls to hate Jews.
Enough of the France of the Islamofascists who, as in era of the Dreyfus affair and the bands of the Marquis de Morès, creep ever further into the realm of the shameful by attacking synagogues and Jewish businesses.
Enough of the demonstrations in which "solidarity with Gaza" is, for too many, no more than a pretext for heaping scorn on all things Jewish.
Enough media reports about the neighborhoods in which Mohamed Merah and Mehdi Nemmouche, the recent killers of Jews in Toulouse and Brussels, are looked upon as heroes.
French Jews certainly have had enough of all this.
Many of them suddenly are wondering whether they are still welcome in the country of the Enlightenment and of Jewish emancipation. Are we still at home, they ask themselves, in this strange country where the vilest anti-Zionism, the stubbornest Holocaust denial, and the murkiest competition for victimhood are combining to produce a new and potentially devastating form of anti-Semitism?
And more and more of them are responding in the negative, pulling up stakes, and leaving for Israel.
Need I say that I understand their growing anxiety?
I, too, feel vulnerable enough to pose the same awful question, one that only yesterday was almost inconceivable, one that I never would have imagined could return in my lifetime with such brutal banality.
And this "inaudible hissing in our common ear" of which philosopher Emmanuel Levinas wrote in an essay on the climate of the 1930s, an essay that I have never been able to read without a shiver of retrospective fear, this "icy wind" that moves through the "still decent" rooms of Jewish residences in the crosshairs of the criminal horde, the fetid breath that "snuffs out lights, rends garments, and carries the howls and shrieks" of unthinking, pitiless mobs -- it is true that I hear and feel them, and the anger they kindle in me is no longer behind me: It is right in front of me.
Nevertheless.
I do not think it is right to leave.
I understand such a decision when it is made for noble reasons of heart and mind and with the will to help strengthen Israeli society.
But I do not think that we should let ourselves be intimidated.
I do not think that we should despair to the point of folding our tents and abandoning the field.
I hold that view for three reasons.
First, France's Jews are not as isolated as they think. From the banning of Dieudonné's anti-Semitic rallies by Justice Minister Manuel Valls to the courageous barring by big-city mayors of both parties of equally anti-Semitic demonstrations that claimed Gaza as their pretext, it must be said that France's public authorities so far have not shrunk from their duty and have been scrupulously vigilant.
Second, France's Jews are not as weak as they think. Like the rest of the population, of course, they have their share of unemployment, job insecurity, and poverty. They have their seniors, who I dare say are doubly weak and vulnerable and who, without the support of exemplary charitable organizations, would have fallen by the wayside long ago. But otherwise, what a collection of strong voices! What a group of responsible people who, having learned the lessons of the older generation, those who were called "French Israelites" and who watched the worst arrive without reacting, no longer let anything slip! And finally there is that miraculous segment of French society, a segment that is still a majority, a segment whose reflexes even more than its conscious thought I fervently believe have been sharpened by history: This time that part of French society will not be taken by surprise when and if the gathering pogromist mob appears.
And then there is a third reason, perhaps the most important reason, for France's Jews not to give up. This is their country. This republic is their work. From Bernard Lazare to Pierre Mendès France, along with René Cassin, Romain Gary, and so many others, Jews are well represented among the builders of a French republic that remains one of the places in the world where the values of humanism and universalism are most alive. Give up? Yield to the red-brown totalitarians and their twins in Marine Le Pen's vague bleu Marine? Abandon this France that has given us so much and to which we have given in equal measure, a democratic France that will be, after its Jews, the next target of the thugs? Not on your life. By temperament and on principle, I cannot see myself turning my back on a political, moral, and spiritual battle that in my heart of hearts I believe will be won by the defenders of the republic.
We must stand our ground.
We must fight.
We must, as the great French actor Jacques Weber bellows from the Paris stage where he is performing my play on Europe's crisis of courage, "be just strong enough to be sure of always being the stronger" in a contest.
Strengthened by that strength, we must stare down the mob, yielding nothing, and, in yielding nothing, defend the principles of coexistence on which France was founded, principles that are so essential to the spirit of Judaism.
Did not the sage say that the first attacked are also the first defenders? Well, then, to the extent that French Jews are on the front line against the brewing barbarism they are its best sentinels. As for those barbarians, they shall not pass.

Its About More Than Footballreddit
When Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice was suspended for only two games for beating his fiancée (now wife), it became a dramatic public example of the lack of accountability for professional athletes. Only when a video came out showing Rice punching his fiancée so hard it knocked her unconscious, and then dragging her limp body from the casino elevator, did the NFL take further action. As new incidents of domestic violence and child abuse come out, many are calling for Commissioner Roger Goodell to resign or lose his job.
But this epidemic is about so much more than Goodell, whose lack of leadership is typical in professional sports. It's about more than one team, one league, or sports in general.
Studies show that one in four American women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime. And when you add rape and stalking, we're talking about one in every three women. Athletes -- at the professional and college levels -- have been engaging in these violent crimes against women for a long time and regularly get away with it -- we all know that. The National Football League, in particular, has taken little or no action against violence against women by its players.
This sends a very clear message to children in this country, boys in particular, who aspire to be athletes, or those who simply see these athletes as role models. The time has come to flip that message and make it one of zero tolerance.
Any professional athlete who assaults a woman should be immediately suspended -- no sports, no contract, no money, and banished from the team and its games. And we should impose similar rules for college and high school football and every other sport. The message of zero tolerance for violence against women -- with a focus on athletes -- must be made absolutely clear. By watching what happens to the professional athletes they often look up to, younger athletes will learn that such behavior is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated anymore. They must learn by watching.
As Christians, we believe in grace, mercy, forgiveness, and second chances. We believe in repentance and redemption. And men who assault women should be called to repentance by the faith community and helped to find redemption for their sins by changing their attitudes, behavior, and lives -- and by offering community service that undermines violence against women. However, repentance and redemption do not come in lieu of punishment for their actions.
Women and men are created in the image of God with equal value. People of faith must proclaim this message -- to NFL Commissioner Goodell and all those in positions of power, including in our own churches. Violence against women -- domestic violence in any form -- is unacceptable.
Zero tolerance of violence against women must be established and enforced and without hesitation -- at every level of athletics and in every place that hallows power and money over justice, commerce over ethics, and institutional defense over decency.
We, as people of faith, need to send the message.

VIDÉO. Sortie de l'iPhone 6: Il l'achète en premier et le fait tomber en sortant de l'Apple Store

TECHNO - Il a attendu des heures devant un Apple Store pour être le premier à acheter l'iPhone 6 à  sa sortie ce vendredi 19 septembre... tout ça pour le faire tomber quelques minutes plus tard.
Interrogé par une chaîne de télévision à la sortie de l'Apple Store de Perth (Australie), le jeune Jack s'apprêtait à commenter son iPhone 6 flambant neuf devant la caméra quand il a maladroitement ouvert la boîte du smartphone et laissé tomber l'objet.
Hué par la foule, passablement gêné, le jeune homme s'est empressé de ramasser le téléphone et de regarder si l'écran n'avait pas pris un choc. "Le pauvre", a compati la journaliste sans pouvoir s'empêcher de sourire.
Cette séquence irrésistible (surtout pour les détracteurs des fans d'Apple), a rapidement été mise sur YouTube par différents téléspectateurs ce vendredi 19 septembre.
Une autre personne a laissé tomber son iPhone 6 mais c'est totalement voulu: c'est pour un crash test. Verdict?

IPHONE 6 - Le grand jour de l'iPhone 6 c'est ce vendredi 19 septembre. Les deux versions , iPhone 6 et iPhone 6 Plus sont prêtes à envahir les boutiques et les files d'attente géantes à se former.
LIRE AUSSI : Les files d'attente pour acheter l'iPhone 6 devant les Apple Store.
Si l'on connaît les prix de tous les opérateurs qui propose les smartphones dès leur sortie, il est est néanmoins difficile de s'y retrouver dans le maquis des tarifs. Que ce soit chez Orange, SFR, Bouygues, Free et les autres, chacun jonglent avec le type d'iPhone choisi, sa capacité et bien sûr du forfait que vous choisirez. Et ça peut s'avérer très compliqué: en tout il faut éplucher des dizaines de tarifications, sans parler de la Fnac qui propose la bête en location.

» Revivez le keynote de présentation d'Apple
Afin de rendre ces tarifs plus comparables, Le HuffPost a cumulé le prix du smartphone et celui de l'abonnement durant deux ans (certains opérateurs exigeant cet engagement pour bénéficier d'un tarif plus avantageux sur le mobile). Ce qui permet en un coup d'oeil de voir lequel est le plus avantageux au global.
Pour rappel, voici le prix du mobile "nu" chez Apple:
iPhone 6 :
64 Go : 919€
128 Go : 1019€
Attention, toutefois, les différences de qualité de forfait n'entrent pas ici en ligne de compte (SMS illimités, appels gratuits vers l'étranger, nombre Go de téléchargement offert, qualité du réseau etc.). Pas plus que les obligations en termes d'engagements (12 mois, 24 mois...). Le tableau ci-dessous restitue donc une échelle des prix mais pas un rapport qualité-prix.
NOTA BENE :Les prix de l'iPhone 6 et de l'iPhone 6 Plus ne sont toujours pas disponibles chez Virgin Mobile. Bouygues n'a pas non plus précisé le prix de l'iPhone 6 Plus en fonction du forfait. Les tableaux seront mis à jour dès que les tarifs de cet opérateur auront été publiés
Sans surprise, Free et Sosh, la marque low cost d'Orange, sont les mieux-disant avec un total forfait 24 mois + prix du mobile de 479,76 euros. Plus étonnant, Bouygues, réputé pour être bon marché avant l'arrivée de Free en 2012, se retrouve tout en haut du classement (ou en bas, c'est selon), avec un total de 1079,76€. Même Orange est légèrement meilleur marché (1031,76€).
Comme toujours, il ne faut donc pas se fier aux prix alléchants proposés sur le mobile: l'iPhone 6 est à 679€ chez Free, soit 110€ de plus que chez Orange ou SFR mais revient au global moins cher.
Sur l'iPhone plus, la hiérarchie est identique:
Le cas particulier de la Fnac
Si la Fnac ne propose pas de forfaits, elle permet cependant de louer les petits derniers de chez Apple à ceux qui seraient déjà engagés auprès d'un opérateur mais qui ne voudraient pas débourser le prix du smartphone vendu "nu" pour y avoir accès.
Depuis le 12 septembre, il est possible de pré-commander un modèle qui vous sera donc prêté pour 29,90 euros/mois pour l’iPhone 6 ou 33,90 euros/mois pour l’iPhone 6 Plus pendant 24 mois.
Une fois l'échéance du "Pass location" arrivée, vous pourrez alors décider d'acheter définitivement votre smartphone ou de le rendre.
Le rappel des prix
SFR
iPhone 6 :
16Go : de 179,99€ (avec un forfait à 84,99€/mois) à 569,99€ (avec un forfait bloqué à 9,99€/mois)
64 Go: de 279,99€ (avec un forfait à 84,99€/mois) à 669,99€ (avec un forfait bloqué à 9,99€/mois)

12 strotypes sur les Espagnol(e)s que vous pouvez oublier12 stéréotypes sur les Espagnols que vous pouvez oublier
Le HuffPost
E-mail
Commenter
INTERNATIONAL - Que savez-vous vraiment sur les Espagnols? Si vous posez la question à un étranger, sa réponse comportera probablement une part de vérité, mais surtout beaucoup d’idées reçues. C’était en tout cas la recette de l'article bourré de clichés paru récemment dans le New York Times : "L’Espagne, pays des dîners à dix heures du soir, se demande s’il ne faudrait pas remettre les pendules à l’heure".
Les films étrangers et les séries télé ne font que renforcer ces clichés. Dans Night and Day, Séville est envahie de taureaux et dans Mon beau-père et nous, Dustin Hoffman va en Espagne pour apprendre … le flamenco.
Une journaliste du HuffPost Espagne a estimé qu'il était largement temps d’en finir avec les mythes sur l’Espagne.
1. On sait tous danser le flamenco
En fait, non. C’est une danse du sud de l’Espagne, et même les habitants du coin ne la connaissent pas tous. En plus, le flamenco n’est pas la seule danse du pays, loin de là. Parmi les autres spécialités régionales, citons le chotis madrilène, la muñeira galicienne, la jota aragonaise, et la sardana catalane, entre autres.
2. On adore tous la corrida
En fait, la corrida prête à controverse en Espagne. On trouve des associations anti-corrida dans tout le pays, et la tauromachie est interdite dans certaines régions, notamment en Catalogne et aux Canaries.
3. On est paresseux et on fait régulièrement la sieste
Personne ne peut nier qu’on a effectivement inventé la sieste et qu’on en est assez fiers, mais ça ne veut pas dire pour autant qu’on en fait une tous les jours (hélas !). A l’heure où ils sont censés se reposer, la majorité des Espagnols travaillent. Les seuls qui peuvent se permettre de faire des siestes sont les retraités et les enfants qui ne sont pas encore en primaire.
4. On mange de la paella à tous les repas
Absolument pas. C’est un plat très populaire à Valence, mais chaque région a sa spécialité culinaire. S’il fallait désigner un plat commun à toute l’Espagne, ce serait l’omelette espagnole (œufs, pommes de terre, oignons).
5. On se torche constamment à la sangria
A vrai dire, on préfère le vin ou la bière. La sangria est surtout prisée des étrangers. Les Espagnols n’en boivent que l’été.
6. On mange des tacos
Flash de dernière minute: on n’est pas au Mexique. On parle peut-être la même langue mais ça ne veut pas dire qu’on mange les mêmes choses ou qu’on joue de la ranchera. Contrairement à ce que laissait entendre How I Met Your Mother et Modern Family, il n’y a pas de mariachis en Espagne.
7. On a tous la peau mate, les yeux marrons et les cheveux bruns
Tous les Espagnols ne ressemblent pas à Pénélope Cruz ou Antonio Banderas (même si ça nous flatte que vous le pensiez). Il nous arrive aussi d’avoir les cheveux blonds et les yeux verts.
Il y en a même qui n’arrivent pas à bronzer. Elsa Pataky est espagnole mais elle ne ressemble pas du tout à Pénélope. Le joueur de foot Gerard Pique (le copain de Shakira) n’a pas non plus le profil type.
8. On est très croyants et on va souvent à la messe
Il faut reconnaître que le discours de Pedro Almodóvar aux Oscars pour Parle avec elle était assez connoté. Et que l’Espagne regorge d’églises, du nord au sud. Mais c’est un pays séculaire qui garantit la liberté de penser, et nous ne sommes que 13,2% à aller régulièrement à la messe .
9. On habite tous à Madrid ou à Barcelone
Il y a 47 millions d’habitants en Espagne, d’après les chiffres de l’institut national espagnol (INE), dont 4,8 millions seulement dans ces deux villes, soit 10% à peine de la population. Le reste vit dans les autres villes du pays, et notamment à Valence, Saragosse, Séville et Malaga, pour ne citer que les plus importantes.
10. On passe notre temps à faire la fête
Bon, d’accord, ça, c’est assez vrai. En Espagne, on n’a pas besoin de raisons pour faire la fête. Notre calendrier est plein de festivités, dont certaines très connues, comme la Tomatina , et d’autres dont vous n’avez jamais entendu parler. Mais ça ne veut pas dire qu’on y participe systématiquement. On n’en aurait ni le temps ni l’énergie.
11. Il fait trèèèèèès chaud
C’est vrai aussi qu’on a du beau temps, mais pas toute l’année, ni partout. Dans le Sud, il fait chaud quasiment du début du printemps jusqu’au milieu du mois d’octobre. Au Nord, c’est différent. En Galice, dans la principauté des Asturies, ou en Cantabrie, les jours de pluie sont fréquents en été, tandis que Madrid et la Castille-et-León connaissent des hivers enneigés et glacés.
12. Notre seul athlète, c’est Rafael Nadal
On est fiers de lui, de ses victoires dans des tournois du Grand Chelems et de sa notoriété internationale qui rejaillit sur l’Espagne, mais il n’est pas notre seul athlète mondialement connu. Je pense notamment aux frères Gasol (basket), à Marc Márquez (moto) et à Fernando Alonso (Formule 1), et même à la nageuse Mireia Belmonte.

Elle prend la mme photo avec ses parents depuis 22 ansPhotos de famille: 22 ans qu'elle reproduit la même image avec ses parents
Le HuffPost
E-mail
Commenter
INSOLITE - Reddit vous donne la bonne raison du jour pour appeler vos parents. Une utilisatrice du réseau social a partagé plusieurs photos d'elle avec son père et sa mère, toujours dans la même pose, alors qu'elle avait 5, 9, 22 et 27 ans.
Sur la première photo, on voit les deux parents se pencher pour embrasser chacun une joue de la fillette rigolarde, en t-shirt vert et violet à l'effigie de Simplet . 22 ans plus tard, c'est une jeune femme radieuse dans sa robe de mariée que ses parents enlacent.
Ce n'est pas la première fois que des internautes s'amusent à recréer des photos à l'identique. En 2013 deux frères recréent les photos de leurs vacances en Roumanie vingt ans plus tard, pour l'anniversaire de leur mère. La photographe Irina Werning va plus loin en reproduisant des photos vieilles de plusieurs décennies jusque dans les moindres détails, du décor en passant par la pose et jusque dans les vêtements.
Une tendance qui finit par blaser les internautes? Si les photos de Kathryn Bigelow ont été vues plus de 770.000 fois, certains laissent des commentaires pour le moins...laconiques. "Je suis déçue que vous ne portiez pas tous les même vêtements sur chacune des photos", note un internaute. "Imgur m'a vraiment rendu tordu", ironise un autre, "j'étais sûr à 99 % que l'un des deux parents seraient absents de la dernière photo". Internet, le lieu où le ridiculement mignon côtoie le plus parfait cynisme.

Les cossais disent "non"  l indpendanceRéférendum en Écosse: les Écossais disent "non" à l'indépendance
Le HuffPost/AFP
E-mail
Commenter
INTERNATIONAL - Le dépouillement total des 32 circonscriptions écossaises a donné vendredi 19 septembre la victoire du non à 55,3% au référendum sur l'indépendance, avec plus de deux millions d'opposants, loin devant le camp du oui à 44,70%, selon les chiffres officiels. Pour remporter le référendum, l'un des deux camps devait obtenir plus de 1.852.828 votes. Le camp du non en compte 2.001.926 contre 1.617.989 pour le oui, tandis que le taux de participation s'établit au niveau record de 84,6%.
Un peu avant l'annonce de ces résultats, la n°2 du camp du oui a admis la défaite probable des partisans de l'indépendance. "Il semble que nous n'allons pas obtenir le oui que nous espérions", a déclaré vendredi matin sur la BBC la vice-Premier ministre écossaise et numéro 2 du parti national écossais, Nicola Sturgeon. Il y a "une réelle déception face au fait que nous avons échoué de justesse à obtenir un vote oui" victorieux au référendum, a-t-elle ajouté.
Le patron du camp du oui, Alex Salmond, qui a quitté dans la nuit Aberdeen pour se rendre en jet privé à Edimbourg, a quant à lui simplement twitté: "Bien joué Glasgow (..) et aux Ecossais pour leur soutien incroyable". "L'Ecosse a décidé, à la majorité, de ne pas devenir, à ce stade, un pays indépendant", a-t-il ensuite dit lors d'une déclaration publique à Édimbourg. "J'accepte le verdict des urnes et j'appelle tous les Ecossais à faire de même et à accepter la décision du peuple", a ajouté, ému, cet homme pour qui le référendum d'indépendance représentait le combat de toute une vie et qui a mené une campagne passionnée ces derniers mois.
Cameron promet de nouveaux pouvoirs
Le Premier ministre britannique a également communiqué via Twitter en écrivant : "J'ai parlé à Alistair Darling (le chef de la campagne du non: NDLR) et je l'ai félicité pour une campagne bien menée". Il a ensuite pris la parole publiquement pour appeler le Royaume-Uni à se "rassembler". "Il est temps pour notre Royaume-Uni de se rassembler et d'aller de l'avant", a déclaré David Cameron lors d'une déclaration au 10, Downing Street à Londres, estimant que la question de l'indépendance de l'Ecosse était désormais réglée pour "une génération".
Il a également annoncé l'octroi de nouveaux pouvoirs aux quatre nations constitutives du Royaume-Uni: Ecosse, Pays de Galles, Irlande du Nord et Angleterre. "Au moment où les Ecossais vont avoir davantage de pouvoirs sur la gestion de leurs affaires, ceci va également s'étendre aux habitants d'Angleterre, du Pays de Galles et d'Irlande du Nord qui doivent avoir aussi davantage leur mot à dire sur les leurs".
I've spoken to Alistair Darling - and congratulated him on an well-fought campaign. #indyref

Le rejet de l'indépendance anticipé par la Bourse
Seuls les 4,2 millions d'électeurs résidents en Ecosse étaient habilités à voter. Les 95,8% de Britanniques restants, Anglais, Gallois et nord-Irlandais, ont assisté en spectateurs au scrutin déterminant pour le sort du Royaume-Uni. Un sondage YouGov auprès de 1828 personnes ayant déposé leur bulletin dans l'urne a également donné le non vainqueur à 54% contre 46% pour le oui.
La Bourse de Londres avait anticipé dans l'après-midi de jeudi un rejet de l'indépendance. "Les investisseurs sont convaincus que les Ecossais vont rester dans l'Union", avait ainsi commenté Fawad Razaqzada, analyste chez Forex.com, tandis que la livre sterling atteignait son plus haut niveau en deux ans face à l'euro.
Les chroniqueurs royaux s'attendaient à un commentaire de la reine dans l'après-midi depuis son château écossais de Balmoral, dans l'extrême nord-est de l'Ecosse.
La bataille des réseaux sociaux
L'Ecosse a changé une dizaine de fois de statut en 1400 ans d'histoire mouvementée et la perspective d'un retour à l'indépendance, 307 ans après l'Acte d'Union qui a rattaché le pays des Scots à ses voisins du sud, a suscité un immense intérêt. Il a encore fait rage jeudi sur les réseaux sociaux, alimentés par le tennisman écossais Andy Murray poussant au oui, et par l'auteur d'Harry Potter, J.K Rowling, qui confiait: "Ma tête dit non et mon cœur le crie".
Huge day for Scotland today! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets do this!
— Andy Murray (@andy_murray) 18 Septembre 2014
Big day in Scotland tomorrow #indyref . My head says no and my heart shouts it - but whatever happens, I hope we're all friends by Saturday.

APPLE - "Bientôt la fin des cartes bancaires physiques", "révolution du e-commerce", "comment Apple Pay pourrait accélérer la mort du portefeuille". Alors que l'iPhone 6 et l'iPhone 6 Plus sont disponibles à la vente ce vendredi 19 septembre, les observateurs ne tarissent pas d'éloges sur la principale innovation de l'iPhone 6, à savoir la puce NFC qui permet le paiement sans contact depuis son smartphone. Mais Apple n'a pas prévu de lancer son système hors des Etats-Unis, même si l'on sait qu'il finira un jour par arriver.
Il n'est donc pas évident de se jeter sur la nouvelle génération d'iPhone si c'est cette fonctionnalité qui vous attire le plus. Des accords bancaires sont nécessaires et la technologie doit également passer la porte des commerçants, ce qui n'est pas encore gagné à court terme.

» Apple Watch: ce qu'on ne sait toujours pas
Apple part donc de loin, mais devrait être davantage préparé pour proposer ce service en Europe d'ici l'année prochaine. D'ailleurs, c'est certainement l'iPhone 6S (sortie en 2015) qui devrait être le véritable ambassadeur du paiement sans contact dans nos contrées. Un cas qui n'est pas sans rappeler d'autres lancements, pour lesquels l'étranger n'a pas toujours été favorisé.
Apple Pay, une approche commerciale et sécuritaire tournée vers les Etats-Unis (2014)
En France, environ 20% des 1,8 million de commerçants sont équipés en terminaux de paiement sans contact. Selon Le Journal du Dimanche, le cap des 30% devrait même être atteint d'ici la fin de l'année. Mais les consommateurs sont encore loins d'être coutumiers de la pratique. Le paiement sans contact représente seulement 1% du montant des transactions totales. De quoi pousser Apple à ralentir la cadence ? Il n'y a en tous cas pas de problème "matériel", car Visa a déclaré que tous les terminaux NFC européens (1,5 million) sont déjà compatibles.
Apple Pay restera dans un premier temps cantonné aux Etats-Unis, où 200.000 commerces ont rejoint le programme (McDonald's et Starbucks notamment). Apple a passé directement des accords avec American Express, Visa et MasterCard. En échange, le groupe se verra reverser une partie des commissions versées aux banques émettrices de cartes bancaires: autour de 0,2% du montant de chaque transaction réglée via Apple Pay, ce qui laisse encore aux banques américaines entre 0,3% et 0,8% des commissions selon le mode de paiement (débit ou crédit).
Mais en France, aucune banque n'est encore entrée en discussion avec Apple. Et l'argument de la sécurité du procédé est moins évident chez nous: la France est en avance sur la sécurisation des cartes magnétiques, tandis que les Etats-Unis ont subi un grand scandale récemment. En France, la fraude n’excède pas 0,045% du montant des transactions par cartes, soit 30% de moins qu’aux Etats-Unis.
Nos commissions interbancaires sont aussi parmi les moins onéreuses au monde (0,28%). Cela pourrait donc coûter plus cher à un commerçant utilisant Apple Pay. Un peu de la même manière que certains refusent la carte bleue avant un certain montant. On annonce une vague disponibilité française de l'Apple Pay en 2015. À suivre...
Passbook vaguement utilisé par nos entreprises (2012)
Bien que présenté il y a 2 ans, le portefeuille numérique Passbook a encore bien du mal à s'imposer chez nous. En clair, l'application permet de regrouper en un seul endroit vos cartes de fidélité, vos billets d'avion, de cinéma, de spectacles etc... Mais au lancement, aucune entreprise française prenait en compte cette nouvelle application alors que tout était prêt aux Etats-Unis.
Air France a mis près d'un an avant d'arriver sur la plate-forme, comme les cinémas Gaumont Pathé. La SNCF s a de son côté patienté 6 mois. Ailleurs, McDo, Leclerc, Auchan, Casino et Monoprix se sont lancés mais n'ont pas été massivement suivis. Outre-Atlantique, l'application explose et de très nombreuses entreprises ont adopté Passbook.
Vraiment dommage car ce logiciel est très bien pensé.
La 4G de l'iPhone 5 (2012)
Surprise lors de la présentation de l'iPhone 5 (2012), Apple annonce un terminal compatible 4G... sauf en Europe (hors Allemagne et Royaume-Uni). La France a été contrainte de commercialiser le smartphone sur les réseaux 3G et 3G+ existants, à un moment où tous les concurrents se montraient compatibles.
La raison est simple: Apple n’a pas choisi de rendre son nouveau smartphone compatible avec les principales bandes fréquences harmonisées et allouées en Europe pour les réseaux 4G: 2,6 GHz et 800 MHz. Apple a choisi la 1800 Mhz, utilisée aux Etats-Unis.
Il a fallu attendre l'année suivante pour que Bouygues Telecom propose enfin une offre 4G. L’opérateur a en effet été autorisé par l’Arcep à convertir en 4G ses fréquences 1800 Mhz utilisées pour la 2G. Les possesseurs d’iPhone 5 désireux d’accéder au très haut débit mobile ont donc pu souscrire un abonnement auprès de Bouygues. Et seulement lui, il fallut attendre l'iPhone 5C/5S pour pleinement utiliser la 4G chez tous les opérateurs.
Siri et le français (2011)
Nouveauté phare de l'année 2011, l'assistant vocal Siri rencontre pas mal de difficultés dans la langue de Molière. Si dans celle de Shakespeare il n'y a pas de problèmes, le français est encore mal utilisé. Si vous lui demandez "quel est le meilleur téléphone ?", Siri peut répondre "il n'y a personne dans vos contacts qui corresponde à ce nom". Si ce genre d'erreur était vraiment récurrent au début, c'est moins le cas maintenant mais le résultat reste infiniment meilleur en anglais.

TELEVISION - Ce fut l'un des moments forts de l'émission Des paroles et des actes diffusée jeudi soir sur France 2. Invité pour commenter la conférence de presse de François Hollande , François Bayrou s'est mué en acteur de théâtre pour dénoncer les rigidités du marché du travail. Le patron du Modem est venu sur le plateau avec sa sacoche dans laquelle figurait deux petites surprises.
La première était un livret de quelques centaines de pages contenant le Code du travail suisse, "là où il y a 4% de chômage". La seconde était l'énorme pavé de 3000 pages que représente le Code du travail français . Cela représente, selon lui, des freins à l'embauche. C'est pour cette raison que le maire de Pau l'a théâtralement jeté sur la table devant; une manière de signifier qu'il était temps de le réformer.
Invité quelques instants plus tard sur le même plateau, le philosophe Michel Onfray a évoqué "un geste obscène". "C'est un code qui protège les travailleurs", a-t-il précisé, sous-entendant que le code suisse était très libéral. Alors qui dit vrai? La réponse dans notre séquence "Ce qu'il ne fallait pas rater" .

Markets may see volatile trading this week: ExpertsBSE
(Besides, investment trend…)
NEW DELHI: Stock markets may see volatile trading this week amid expiry of derivatives contract on Thursday, experts said.
Besides, investment trend by overseas investors , global cues, movement of rupee against the dollar and crude oil price would continue to influence trading at the bourses.
"In near-term, market movement will depend upon the monetary policy review on September 30, where it is expected that the RBI will continue to exhibit status-quo stance on interest rates," said Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.
Marketmen said in absence of any domestic triggers, participants would look at FII ( Foreign institutional investors ) investment and rupee movement against the US dollar.
"With the initial jitters around the US rate increase subsiding, markets are expected to rally ahead due to renewed optimism in the economy," said Aman Chowdhury, CEO & CO-Founder, Cians Analytics.
The US Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen in the policy setting meeting promised to keep the interest rates near zero for a "considerable time after its bonds buying programme comes to an end in October, giving immediate relief to the emerging markets, including India, as fears of immediate capital outflows subsided.
Analysts said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US tour from this week will also be closely watched by investors back home.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be at the White House on September 29-30 for talks with US President Barack Obama.

Nifty Sets Sight at 8200; Derivatives Expiry to See Heightened VolatilityThe Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
The week ahead should see higher than normal volatility as the markets head into a derivative contract expiry week.
Most traders were caught flat-footed last week as the Nifty saw huge gyrations and saw an intra-day move of almost 200 points on Thursday. This was on the back of uncertainty on the Federal Reserve policy on Wednesday and also a weaker than expected performance of the BJP in the Assembly elections.
Most participants were confused as the sharp rally on Thursday was the best in almost 100 days and was more 'short covering' as bears scrambled for cover as the event uncertainty of the Federal Reserve got over.
The Nifty ended the week almost flat, gaining 0.20 per cent, while the outperformer was the CNX IT which ended up 2.43 per cent, while the underperformer was the CNX METAL which ended down 2.66 per cent.
Market breadth also lagged as few large cap heavyweights propped up the Nifty with outperformance coming from Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Maruti Suzuki India, Hero MotoCorp and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).
Globally, the US markets also rallied after the Federal Reserve indicated continuance of the low interest regime for an extended period and the Dow Jones ended the week at another high. Oil prices were very range-bound with Brent crude closing near $ 98 per barrel.
Gold prices saw extended weakness with local Indian spot prices closing below Rs 27,000. Silver process also crashed and closed at a 4-year low.
Optimism over India's strong trade ties with China, and commitment of investments worth $20 billion in the country over the next five years along with short-covering by traders aided the recovery. With major events out of the way, the coming week will see change in portfolios. Trend in investment activity of FIIs (foreign institutional investors) and movement in global markets will determine the near-term trend on the domestic bourses.
This week's recovery following a sharp corrective phase has proved that 7850-7900 is likely to act as a strong base for the index. As long as Nifty sustains above the same, positive bias will prevail. At lower levels, pockets of strength emerged both from defensives as well as cyclical. The Bank Nifty sustaining above the earlier breakout point of 15,700 is another positive. We believe, the next leg of up-move is likely to be led by banks.
The top 3 gainers on the Nifty were Dr Reddy's, up 8.9 per cent, Hero, up 7 per cent, and TCS, up 4.1 per cent, while the top 3 losers were Jindal Steel, down 10.8 per cent, ONGC, down 5.8 per cent, and BPCL, 3.8 per cent.
With 8200 on the Nifty within reach brace yourself for a volatile week as discomfort on the index rally has seen most participants on the side line and as the cry for a sharp correction gets louder expect the rally to continue albeit at a slower pace.

India drops Israeli LAHAT  will develop own missile for Arjun Mk-2India drops Israeli missile for Arjun Tank
Rahul Singh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 21, 2014
First Published: 19:31 IST(21/9/2014) | Last Updated: 07:36 IST(22/9/2014)
Comments
The homemade Arjun Mk-2 tank has suffered a major setback, with a critical Israeli anti-tank missile to be fitted on it failing to meet the army’s requirements.
The development comes at a time when the defence ministry has set the ball rolling for buying 118 Arjun Mk-2 tanks at a cost of more than Rs. 6,600 crore.
 The tank developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is an upgraded version of the Mk-1 variant, 119 of which have been inducted in the army.
One of the most significant upgrades proposed in the new tank is its missile-firing capability. 
However, the failure of the laser homing anti-tank (LAHAT) missile, manufactured by the Israeli Aerospace Industries, will seriously hinder the ongoing project as the DRDO will now have to work on an indigenous missile that can be fired from the tank.
In an exclusive interview to HT, DRDO chief Avinash Chander said, “The LAHAT missile doesn’t figure in our plans anymore. We are dropping it. We have been working on a tube-launched anti-tank missile, which hopefully can be configured for the tank’s cannon.”
The Mk-2 variant is supposed to have nearly 80 improved features over the previous version, including more than 15 major technology upgrades.  
Chander said the LAHAT missile did not meet the army’s requirements of engaging targets at ranges of less than 1,200 metres. It has an effective range of 6,000 metres.
The major improvements on the new tank include better firepower, integrated explosive reactive armor, advanced laser warning and countermeasure system, a mine plough, a remotely-operable anti-aircraft weapon, advanced land navigation system and enhanced night vision capabilities.
However, the army may not be able to fully exploit the tank, powered by a German engine, as it is too heavy at 67 tonnes.
The Mk-2 may be hailed as an Indian-made tank but it represents barely 36-38% indigenisation, compared to 60% on the Mk-1. “The indigenous quotient has fallen because the major improvements over Mk-1 required imports,” the DRDO chief said.   
The army raised its maiden armoured regiment equipped with Arjun Mk-1 tanks in May 2009, more than 35 years after the project was conceived. The Arjun was earlier plagued with problems concerning its fire control system, suspension and poor mobility.
Currently, Russian T-90s and T-72s are the mainstay of India’s tank fleet.

Overseas Investor Inflows in Debt Market Cross Rs 1 Lakh Crore in 2014 so far
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 21, 2014 21:45 (IST)
The Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
New Delhi: Foreign investors have pumped in over a staggering Rs 1 lakh crore into the Indian debt market since the beginning of the year primarily on account of government's reform agenda.
As per the latest data, foreign investors have purchased debt securities worth Rs 2,82,194 crore in this year so far, while they offloaded bonds to the tune of Rs 1,64,820 crore during the same period, resulting into a net inflow of Rs 1,17,374 crore ($19.45 billion).
These huge inflows included a net investment of Rs 14,900 crore in this month so far.
According to market experts, improved fundamentals of the Indian economy, a decisive mandate to the BJP-led NDA at the Centre, various reform measures announced by the government and high interest rate have caught the fancy of overseas investors (foreign institutional investors, sub-accounts and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).
The inflow is also significantly higher in debt compared to equities, which till date have attracted Rs 85,330 crore ($14.2 billion).
Most of the inflow into Indian debt has gone into government securities.
Since May 16 when the election results were announced, overseas investors have poured in close to Rs 86,000 crore in the Indian debt market, as the verdict met foreign investors' expectations in the Lok Sabha polls.
In 2013, foreign investors had pulled out a net amount of Rs 50,848 crore from the country's bond market.
Strong inflows in the recent months have taken the cumulative net investments of foreign investors into Indian debt market to Rs 2.22 lakh crore, while their investments in dollar terms are $44 billion.
This is based on the data since November 1992 when overseas investors began investing into Indian markets.

An engineer by training, Steven Mollenkopf climbed to become the CEO of Qualcomm—one of the world’s largest producers of microchips for mobile devices. As such, you might think he’d be a big proponent of carefully sketched-out career planning. You’d be wrong. Here’s his advice for new college graduates, from a Q&A style interview in today’s  New York Times :
What advice do you give new college grads?
Don’t have a plan, because you can underestimate what your abilities are, and you might limit yourself in some cases with a plan. I also think luck is very important. Be sure that you allow for luck to occur, and when it happens, run toward the fire, not run away from it. The people who are really good, and the people you want on your team, are the ones who see an opportunity and they get excited about it versus shrinking away.
You’ve also got to just trust in your own ability. You can fix everything, basically, so don’t be afraid to make mistakes.

Jobless rates up in 24 states; hiring up in 35

WASHINGTON (AP) — Unemployment rates rose in nearly half of U.S. states in August, even as employers in two-thirds of the states added jobs.
The Labor Department says unemployment increased in 24 states, fell in 15 and was unchanged in 11. Hiring picked up in 35 states, while it fell in 15.
Unemployment rates can rise even when hiring increases if more people start looking for work and don't immediately find jobs. The state figures suggest hiring was broad-based across most regions of the country last month, even as nationwide job gains in August were the weakest this year.
Georgia's unemployment rate jumped to 8.1 percent from 7.7 percent in July to the highest among all the states. It was followed by Mississippi at 7.9 percent. That's the first time Georgia has had the highest rate since the Great Recession ended. Previously, Nevada, Michigan and Rhode Island have had the highest.
Georgia's rate rose even as its employers added the fourth-most jobs in the nation last month, gaining 15,800. The hiring and unemployment data can conflict because they come from two separate surveys. One is of households and the other survey covers businesses.
The national unemployment rate dipped to 6.1 percent in August, from 6.2 percent the previous month. Employers added 142,000 jobs, below an average of 212,000 in the previous 12 months.
North Dakota had the lowest rate in the nation, as it has for many years, at 2.8 percent. The state is benefiting from an oil and gas drilling boom. It was followed by three states with 3.6 percent unemployment: Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah.
The biggest job gains were in Texas, which added 46,600 jobs, followed by California, with 27,700 and Michigan, with 17,900.
The Midwest had the lowest unemployment rate among the nation's four regions, at 5.8 percent. The unemployment rate in the Northeast was 6.2 percent, followed by 6.3 percent in the South and 6.6 percent in the West.

(This deal is the second in…)
MUMBAI: Kotak Mahindra Capital Management has acquired the domestic schemes of Pine-Bridge Mutual Fund . The deal will add about Rs 660 crore to Kotak's assets under management (AUM) of roughly Rs 37,000 crore as on August 31. The total assets managed by the domestic mutual fund industry were about Rs 10,00,000 crore as on March 31. Kotak did not disclose the size of the deal, but mutual fund industry officials speculate the acquisition cost could be minuscule.
This deal is the second in India's mutual fund industry so far in 2014. PineBridge is the third global financial services firm to exit the local asset management industry since December 2013. In May, Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund acquired the schemes of ING Investment Management, a joint venture between Dutch financial services group ING, realtor Rajan Raheja and Kirti Equities. Late in December 2013, Morgan Stanley had announced the sale of the schemes of its Indian asset management company to HDFC Mutual Fund .
Several foreign financial services firms are looking to exit the domestic mutual fund industry as most of them are reeling under losses and have been unable to scale up the domestic business. Industry officials said the recent step by Sebi to increase networth requirement to Rs 50 crore from .`10 crore could also force some more smaller fund houses to wind up operations.

Por primera vez en la historia del reality show Gran Hermano , una presentadora convivirá con los concursantes. Esto es algo inédito tanto en España como en los 80 países en los que se realizan ediciones de este programa. Mercedes Milá entró en la noche de este jueves en la casa de Guadalix de la Sierra de Gran Hermano 15, de Telecinco, junto a una gallina de nombre Falacia que le había acompañado en la grabación de varias promociones.
Ahora es cuando Mercedes les da la sorpresa, ya os dijimos que nadie entra en solitario #gala1gh15
— Gran Hermano (@ghoficial) septiembre 18, 2014
Mientras Milá, de 63 años, entraba en la casa, recibida con aplausos por los concursantes, el plató quedaba en solitario. Su papel como conductora del programa lo desempeñará el director de la casa, 'El Súper'. Es el hombre del que sólo conocemos la voz al que se dirigen los concursantes en el confesionario. Junto a él, el cómico Florentino Fernández hará el papel de 'Súper' maligno .

En total hay 17 concursantes y una cabra . Los participantes viven la experiencia acompañados, algunos por familiares y amigos y otros han sido emparejados por los organizadores del programa, como es el caso de Shaima, una ceutí musulmana y Paco, un taxista madrileño.
Aún quedan por conocer muchos detalles de cómo será la mecánica de esta edición del concurso. Este domingo habrá una segunda gala de la presentación de la temporada en la que se despejarán las dudas.

(The outlook for the Indian…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex staged a smart rally towards the end of the week to record sixth straight week of rise. However, US Fed uncertainty capped gains and both Sensex and Nifty registered marginal gains for the week ended September 19.
The S&P BSE Sensex closed 0.1 per cent higher, while Nifty ended 0.2 per cent up. The Midcap index closed 1.4 per cent higher while the BSE Small-cap index ended 0.2 per cent up.

The market may remain volatile as traders roll over positions in the futures & options (F&O) segment from the near month September 2014 series to October 2014 series on Thursday, 25 September.
"Trend in investment by FPIs, trend in global markets, movement of rupee against the dollar & crude oil price movement will dictate near trend on the domestic bourses," said Rohit Gadia, Founder & CEO, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.

LONDON (Reuters) - Jamie Donaldson finalised his preparations for next weekend's Ryder Cup with an excellent final round of 67 to finish two shots off the lead at the Wales Open at Celtic Manor on Sunday but European team mates Lee Westwood and Thomas Bjorn struggled.
Welshman Donaldson, who will make his Ryder Cup debut against the United States at Gleneagles, bogeyed the second hole of the day before he birdied three of the next four holes to kickstart his round.
Three further birdies followed in a composed back nine and the 38-year-old looks in fine fettle ahead of the Scotland showdown.
Former world number one Westwood, who was a wildcard selection in Paul McGinley's European team, started the final round three-under-par but bogeyed six of his opening 11 holes as he carded a five-over-par 76.
Meanwhile Denmark's Bjorn had a similarly poor round as he shot a three-over-par 74 to finish one-over-par for the tournament, 15 shots behind Dutch tournament winner Joost Luiten.

Investing.com - Investing.com - Crude oil fell in ASia on Monday to start the week though investors are primed to react to potential supply issues in geopolitical hotspots and the prospect of upbeat data sets in the U.S. this week.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in November traded at $91.57 a barrel, down 0.15%.
Last week, West Texas Intermediate oil futures declined on Friday, as concerns about weak demand and a broadly stronger U.S. dollar weighed.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said September 17 that U.S. crude oil inventories increased by 3.7 million barrels last week, the first weekly gain in five weeks.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 362.3 million barrels, the highest level for this time of year since 2012.
A stronger dollar also kept pressure on oil and other dollar-denominated commodities. The greenback rose to its highest level in more than six years against the yen USD/JPY, while the euro EUR/USD slid to fresh 14-month lows after the Federal Reserve brought forward its outlook for rising interest rates.
For the end of 2015, the median forecast was 1.375% Oil prices typically weaken when the U.S. currency strengthens as the dollar-priced commodity becomes more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery tacked on 69 cents, or 0.71%, on Friday to settle at $98.39 a barrel by close of trade.
For the week, the November Brent contract gained $1.28, or 1.3%, amid reports that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could trim its 2015 output target by 500,000 barrels per day at its November meeting in light of weakening global demand.
London-traded Brent prices have slid in recent weeks on concerns that global supply remains ample while demand remains weak.
In the week ahead, investors will be awaiting Tuesday's data on euro zone private sector activity, amid concerns that the recovery in the region is losing momentum. Preliminary data on manufacturing activity in China will also be closely watched.
The week will also bring a fresh look at the U.S. housing sector, with reports on both new and existing home sales, as well as Thursday's data on durable goods orders and initial jobless claims.

THE VALIANT: Lemire  Kindt & Rivera thrilled to team on the coolest thing that we couldComing in December: “The Valiant.” (courtesy of Valiant Comics)
THE VALIANT COMICS universe might be experiencing its Big Bang moment.
Not that Valiant’s 21st-century modernization of ’90s classics and successful 2012 relaunch doesn’t qualify as a universe-building moment. But with this summer’s announcement that writer Jeff Lemire (DC Comics/Vertigo) is teaming with Matt Kindt (Unity, Rai) and artist Paolo Rivera (Daredevil) on a four-issue miniseries set to debut in December called The Valiant, one might sense that Valiant is attempting to take things to another level.
Possibly the biggest news to come from the announcement, outside of Lemire teaming with longtime friend Kindt on writing duties — with Rivera doing interior artwork for Valiant — was that Lemire is no longer being exclusive to DC Comics/Vertigo. Lemire’s reimagining of Green Arrow has been one of the highlights of DC’s New 52 era, and his creator-owned works “Sweet Tooth” (on which he briefly collaborated with Kindt) and “Trillium” for Vertigo have been well-received.
“After four years of DC Comics, I had to decide if I was going to stay exclusive or not,” Lemire told The Post’s Comic Riffs. “It just seemed to be a lot of opportunities for me at this point in my career. [Now] seemed like a good time to spread out and work with some new people and try some new things.”
Lemire says that The Valiant — featuring Bloodshot, the Eternal Warrior, Geomancer and almost everyone who is anyone in the Valiant universe — wasn’t intended to have such a universal impact on Valiant as a whole, but that the story naturally continued to grow after continued conversations with Kindt.
“When Matt and I first talked about doing something together at Valiant, it wasn’t with this idea of doing a big event — it was more … like it would just be a fun, little project,” Lemire told Comic Riffs. “Our ideas sort of expanded and grew and became something bigger. It wasn’t [Valiant] coming to us asking us to write this sort of universalized thing — it was more something that grew out of us coming up with the coolest thing that we could.”
With more than two years of new titles, both writers realize that some readers might be hesitant to give The Valiant a try if they are not caught up on other Valiant titles. But Kindt and Lemire say that the forthcoming miniseries will be as friendly to new readers as possible.
“If you’ve heard about Valiant and you’re curious, you can pick this up and you’re going to get a good story — and you’re going to get a taste of everybody in the universe in addition to that story,” Kindt said. “It’s a tricky thing to write something that is accessible to the [brand-new] reader … and also something that satisfies people who have been following Valiant forever, but I think we did a good job.”
Lemire echoed that idea. “Me being new to the [Valiant] universe, I was very conscious of trying to understand the core concepts of each character and then relaying that to a new reader,” he said. “Matt and I were also very conscious of creating a story that is satisfying for long-term readers. The priority, outside from telling a great story, was to make something that was a perfect entry point for people who had maybe been curious about Valiant, but hadn’t picked anything up yet.”
When Lemire and Kindt were talking with Valiant Executive Editor Warren Simons about art duties on The Valiant, Rivera’s name shot to the top of their wish-list.
“Paolo kind of became the dream artist for the project. I never thought we could actually get him,” Lemire said. “In my mind, Paolo is one of the top cartoonists working in comics today. His storytelling skills are impeccable. The first issue is so gorgeous to look at; he just brings so much life and emotion to these characters. It’s pretty amazing.”
Kindt was so impressed with Rivera’s initial layout art that he was convinced it was the final product. “I thought that was the finished art,” Kindt said. “I said, ‘Let’s publish this.’ ”
Simons had been trying to persuade Rivera to sign with Valiant since their relaunch. “I knew Warren back when he used to work at Marvel,” Rivera told Comic Riffs. “In 2012, that’s when I came off of Daredevil. Me and my dad went to Baltimore Comic Con [that year and Simons] tried to convince me to come to Valiant. I’ve done covers for them [before], but this will be the first interior work I’ve done for them.”
“I always change a little bit [visually] from book to book,” Rivera noted. For The Valiant, “especially with the opening sequence with the Eternal Warrior, it’s sort of…not sorcery, but it’s a very different tone than what I’m used to [drawing.]”
Neither Lemire or Kindt (who will continue writing Unity and Rai ) were ready to talk about future projects after The Valiant, but both hinted at major announcements.
“For me, doing ‘The Valiant’ was sort of an entry point into this universe — and I plan on sticking around,” Lemire said.

Pre-market: Nifty seen opening lower; may retest 8100 levelsSave precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open lower on Monday following muted trend seen in other Asian markets. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to retest its crucial psychological level of 8100 in trade today.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 54 points higher at 8070 indicating negative opening on the domestic market.
The 50-share Nifty index staged a smart rally towards the end of the week to record sixth straight week of rise. However, US Fed uncertainty capped gains and both Sensex and Nifty registered marginal gains for the week ended September 19.
Nifty moved past the resistance of 8130 in intraday trade but was unable to close above it. Initial support for the index is placed at 8030.
If Nifty manages to stay above 8030 and clears the resistance of 8130 then there is a possibility of a retest of 8180 and possibly 8229, GEPL Capital said in a report.
"But a move below 8030 can bring it down till 8000 and lower. An important support for short term is now placed at 7920; however, the medium term support and trend reversal level remains at 7820 for Nifty," added the report.
On Friday, US stocks closed flat after Alibaba's strong debut was offset by falling technology shares as Oracle and Yahoo stumbled, but the Dow managed to edge higher to set a record for a second straight session.
"Alibaba took the spotlight after its initial public offering priced at $68 a share and rose as high as $99.70 before ending the session up 38 percent to $93.89, Reuters reported.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 13.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to 17,279.74, the S&P 500 lost 0.96 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,010.40, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 13.64 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 4,579.79.
Asian shares were trading lower. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was trading 0.74 per cent lower at 16,247 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 1.05 per cent lower at 24,040.
South Korea's Kospi index was trading 0.67 per cent lower at 2,040 and China's Shanghai index was trading 0.74 per cent lower at 2,312.

KKR and Co. eyes $230 million share sale in Bharti InfratelKohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. eyes $230 million share sale in Bharti Infratel

(KKR owns 4.5 crore shares,…)
MUMBAI|NEW DELHI: American private equity fund Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. (KKR) is set to launch a share sale that could raise about $230 million as it exits Bharti Infratel six years after investing, taking advantage of a sharp rebound in the valuations of the telecom tower company.
"It will be via block trades on the stock exchanges. KKR has already called for pitches from investment banks such as Morgan Stanley, UBS and Citigroup," a person with direct knowledge of the development said. "The intention is to launch it (the share sale) this week, but depends on a lot of variables, so it's not set in stone."
Bharti Infratel is run by India's largest phone company by revenue, Bharti Airtel. KKR and Bharti Infratel declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, UBS and Citigroup didn't respond to calls.
KKR owns 4.5 crore shares, or 2.38%, of Bharti Infratel, which has more than 36,000 telecom towers of its own. In addition, Bharti Infratel has a 42% holding in Indus Towers , the country's largest telecom tower company that's owned jointly by Vodafone India , Idea and Bharti Airtel.
At Friday's closing price of Rs309.75 on the BSE , the sale could fetch KKR about Rs1,393.9 crore ($232 million). This compares with its investment at Rs220 a unit totalling Rs990 crore ($250 million at 2008 rupee levels, but $165 million at current levels), meaning KKR would be getting less than it paid six years ago, thanks to the sharp rupee depreciation against the dollar in the interim.
"KKR has not made much money during the tenure. But since its investment tenure is coming to an end, it wanted to exit at least close to cost," said a banker in the know. "It has got an opportunity as the Bharti Infratel stock has risen sharply in recent times."
Since its IPO price of Rs220 in December 2012, Bharti Infratel's stock plunged to an all-time low of Rs148 in June 2013, mirroring the troubles in the telecom industry, and consequently the tower companies.
But an upswing in the fortunes of the sector amid call rate increases, less competition and a relatively clearer regulatory environment, meant a turnaround in the fortunes of the tower sector as well, including the financials of Bharti Infratel.
The company's stock has surged almost 83% in the year to date, and hit its all-time intraday high ofRs321.55 on Thursday. The broader stock market has also been buoyant in the past year or so, touching alltime records.
Many private equity funds are looking to sell stakes in mobile and tower companies as higher valuations are increasing pressure on them to exit to return money to limited partners, their investors.
On September 4, American private equity fund Providence Equity Partners sold a fourth of its holding in India's third-largest mobile telephony company Idea Cellular for approximately Rs1,414 crore in block trades in the stock market. It offloaded a 2.4% stake in the telecom operator by selling 8.5 crore shares acquired through investment arm P5 Asia Investment (Mauritius). At the end of the June quarter, Providence Equity Partners had a 9.31% stake in Idea Cellular.

The Dow Friday notched its third straight record high in mixed Wall Street trade on Friday as shares of Chinese online retail giant Alibaba soared following a record initial public offering.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.08 per cent to close at 17,279.74.
In Tokyo morning trading Monday, SoftBank, which has about a one-third equity stake in Alibaba, was down 2.0 per cent at 8,565.0 yen after the recent rises.
The Japanese Internet and mobile service company said Saturday it was likely to report $4.6 billion in investment gain following Alibaba's record stock offering.

Oracle founder Larry Ellison resigns after 37 years as CEOOracle Corp Chief Executive Larry Ellison introduces the Oracle Database In-Memory during a launch event at the company's headquarters in Redwood Shores, California June 10, 2014. REUTERS/Noah Berger/Files
By Noel Randewich and Bill Rigby
SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Larry Ellison, co-founder and leader of Oracle Corp for 37 years, stepped aside as chief executive officer on Thursday, to be replaced by co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, raising questions about a job-sharing arrangement that has had a fraught record elsewhere.
Ellison and the two new co-CEOs each stressed that nothing would change under the new management structure, with Ellison staying on as executive chairman and chief technology officer.
But Oracle shares fell 2 percent to $40.70 in after-hours trading after it reported the management shake-up and that profit had fallen below Wall Street's average forecast, hurt by weak hardware sales.
The move immediately attracted criticism from management experts.
"In almost all cases, these co-CEO configurations are a jerry-rigged solution to a political problem," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale School of Management.
The move comes earlier than expected by many investors, and appears designed to address concerns about the company's direction under Ellison, 70, who co-founded the database company that became Oracle in 1977 and has been Oracle's only CEO.
"While there was some speculation Larry could step down, the timing is a bit of a head scratcher and the Street will have many questions," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "Investors have a mixed view of Safra and especially Hurd as co-CEOs given the missteps we have seen from the company over the past few years."
On a conference call with analysts, Ellison said: "I'm going to continue doing what I've been doing over the last several years. They're going to continue what they've been doing over the last several years," referring to Hurd, 57, and Catz, 52. "Mark and Safra have done a spectacular job and I think they deserve the recognition of their new titles."
Catz and Hurd echoed that mantra on the call.
"I want to make sure we are very, very clear. There will actually be no changes," said Catz. "No changes whatsoever."
For his part, Hurd stressed that Oracle was not hierarchical. "We're pretty flat in terms of the way we run the place, and we want to keep it that way," he told the conference call.
The creation of two CEO roles, which has largely been unsuccessful when tried at other companies, raises questions of how Catz and Hurd, both strong personalities, will work together at the top.
"Co-CEO structures are typically not ideal," said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones. "They’re both very independent thinkers who have strong wills. At times they won’t agree. But they have worked closely together, and with Ellison. We don’t see the day-to-day changing."
The two have very different histories. Catz, trained in finance and law, was a Wall Street banker from 1986 until she joined Oracle in 1999, and has been a central figure in Oracle's many acquisitions.
Sales-oriented Hurd spent 25 years at computer and ATM pioneer NCR Corp before joining Hewlett-Packard, where he was CEO from 2005 until 2010, when he resigned in the wake of sexual harassment claims by a female contractor. HP concluded that its harassment policy had not been violated but that Hurd had made inaccurate expense claims concealing entertainment for the contractor. He was courted by Ellison and joined Oracle later that year.
STEPPING BACK, BUT STILL PRESENT
Under the new arrangement, manufacturing, finance and legal functions at Oracle will continue to report to Catz, while sales and service units will continue to report to Hurd. Software and hardware engineering will continue to report to Ellison.
The major difference is that Catz and Hurd will now report to Oracle's board, rather than to Ellison himself, although Ellison is now executive chairman of that board.
Ellison will keep working full time, Oracle said in a statement. His step back from the top job mirrors Bill Gates at Microsoft, who stepped down as chairman of the software giant earlier this year but remains a board member and adviser to new CEO Satya Nadella.
Ellison has recently been edging back from his role as the face of Oracle. Last year, he skipped a quarterly conference call to be out on the water to watch his Oracle Team USA compete in sailing's America’s Cup, and he also skipped his widely followed keynote speech at Oracle's OpenWorld conference as the regatta got down to its nail-biting final races.
But he promised to appear on the company's quarterly earnings calls with analysts. "You'll have to wait a little while longer before you get me off the calls," he told analysts on Thursday. "I apologize to everyone for that."
Marc Benioff, CEO of Oracle competitor Salesforce.com, commented on Twitter that Ellison will remain in power.
"There always has been, & always will be, one CEO at Oracle," Benioff tweeted in reaction to the news.
RAGS TO RICHES
Raised in a rough Chicago neighborhood, Ellison built Oracle into one of Silicon Valley's most successful technology companies, whose databases have become the technology backbones of the world's largest corporations.
Ellison took the company public in 1986, the same year as Microsoft, with revenue of $55 million. This fiscal year revenues are expected to top $40 billion.
Through dozens of acquisitions, Ellison widened Oracle's portfolio of business software to include tools for customer service, human resources and business intelligence, investing tens of billions of dollars to acquire PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and other tech companies.
But in recent years, Ellison has stumbled. Investors widely criticized his $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010 after sales of Sun servers and other equipment fell after the deal.
Ellison famously mocked cloud computing as "complete gibberish" in a 2008 tirade after a Wall Street analyst asked him to comment on the new phenomenon, a broad term referring to the delivery of computer services via the Internet from remote data centers.
Since his remarks, cloud computing has become a driving force in enterprise software and Oracle is struggling to build out its own cloud offerings to catch up with smaller rivals.
Ellison, who battled big rivals IBM and SAP for most of his tenure, appeared to change his tune this year, when he called Amazon.com and Salesforce.com the company's most immediate threat.

India gets its first transgender TV news anchorIndia gets its first transgender TV news anchor
Reuters –  Fri 19 Sep, 2014

NEW DELHI: An Indian television news station has recruited the country's first transgender news anchor, five months after a court ruled that transgender people be recognised as a legal third gender, a newspaper reported on Friday.
Padmini Prakash, 31, who works at Lotus News in Tamil Nadu, told the Times of India that she had faced a lot of discrimination throughout her life, including being disowned by her family.
She worked as a dancer and then acted in Tamil soap operas before joining the news channel.
Prakash said it was daunting to take such a high profile role.
"I was very worried because I also had to focus on my diction and maintain a steady narrative pace to ensure that there was clarity and viewers could understand me," said Prakash.
Campaigners say there are hundreds of thousands of transgender people in India but because they were not legally recognised, they have been ostracised, faced discrimination, abuse and often forced into prostitution.
In April, India's Supreme court recognised transgender as a legal third gender and, in a landmark judgment lauded by human rights groups, called on the government to ensure their equal treatment.
India was not the first country to give legal recognition to the transgender community. Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh have also legally recognised a third gender.
Prakash became so popular with viewers after joining the station last month that she was quickly promoted to become the face of the Coimbatore-based Lotus News Channel's daily 7 p.m. special bulletin.
"We are very supportive of Padmini .... after initial trials, we were convinced that she had the potential to be an excellent news anchor," Lotus News Channel Chairman G.K.S. Selvakumar told the newspaper.

Go ahead  take it: The 21-day desk-free challengeView Photo
The 21-Day Desk-Free Challenge
A decade ago I never would have imagined a day in my business life when I would not have needed a fax machine. In the real estate world, it's all about contracts and paperwork and transacting business with people in hundreds of different communities. But now technology has replaced my fax machine along with my typewriter and my watch.
Five months ago I looked around my office and wondered, "What else will become obsolete?" Perhaps by getting ahead of the curve I could eliminate things in my business that were holding me back from building a more efficient empire. As I looked around my office one day, the one noticeable item that seemed pretty obsolete was my desk. I opened the drawers to see what was inside.
There were files from old conferences that I had attended. There were old boxes of business cards. Basically my desk was full of old files, memos and correspondence. My desk had become a receptacle for stuff that should have been thrown away but for seem reason I hadn't do so. Five months ago, I challenged myself to living without a desk.  
It's been said that it takes 21 days to create a habit. So right off the bat, I decided to not visit my office for 21 days. I own a large real estate business with sales offices throughout Massachusetts. Instead of going every day to my personal office (where my desk is) as I usually did, I chose to start living out of my briefcase and visiting all my sales offices.
It started off as a 21-day challenge, but it wasn't hard at all. Now five months have gone by and I can count on one hand the number of times I have visited that old desk of mine. I work from conference rooms, coffee shop corners and reception areas. When I need to make a private call, it's not so hard to find a little spot somewhere to do so. Living desk-free has been a game changer.
Here are the five lessons learned from living without a desk:
Related:  7 Steps to Turbocharge Your Startup Without Losing Your Best Talent
1. Building relationships.
Working without a desk has enabled me to form more and better relationships with my 250 real estate agents. They don't have to come out to headquarters and find me behind my desk because I run into them at their offices when I spend a couple hours or entire days working from a conference room. Now instead of getting to know only a handful of people in my company, I've really gotten to know hundreds of my people. My relationships have deepened because I'm unchained from my desk.
2. Embracing technology.
Life without a desk has forced me to embrace technology. My old brown desk used to be filled with yellow sticky notes of stuff to do. Those sticky notes have been replaced with cool technologies like Evernote that organize my lists, remind me to do stuff and give me a historical record of what I completed and when.

3. Feeling liberated.
I've come to feel like a desk is nothing more than a glorified trash receptical. I no longer store stuff I don't need because I have nowhere to put it. I take notes on my iPad at conferences. I scan business cards into my phone. And all the other stuff gets thrown away or better yet I choose to not even take stuff when I attend events because I know that it will just end up in the trash. Everything I need is kept in organized notes on my iPad.
4. Questioning the status quo.
Ever since I stopped using my desk I find myself looking for more opportunities to improve my efficiency. Do I really need the laptop anymore? Maybe the laptop is just a crutch like my old desk used to be. Leaving that old desk behind taught me to question everything that I use in my life. I've come to realize that there are many things that we use daily only because that's the way it's always been and not because it's smart or efficient.
5. Cutting costs.
By embracing the desk-free challenge, I've saved costs. I no longer need the desk or the space around it. What would my company look like if I could teach others the value of living desk-free? There's a price for space and what I've learned through the desk-free challenge is that the real cost for my business was my sitting behind a desk. My business and life have changed for the better all because I questioned, "Do I really need this desk?"

National Payment Corp Scrambles to Issue RuPay CardsKisan Vikas Patra Vs Bank FD: What You Should Know
Mumbai: Although close to 4 crore bank accounts have been opened under the Jan Dhan Yojana so far, there is a huge backlog in the issuance of the Rupay cards by the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), the sole issuer of ATM cards for these new accounts.
Over the weekend, Financial Services Secretary G S Sandhu had said that banks had opened 4 crore accounts so far and mobilised about Rs 3,700 crore as deposits in these accounts.
"Although the number of accounts opened are very high, about 20 lakh (RuPay) cards have been issued so far," National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) managing director and chief executive A P Hota told PTI.
There is a lag in production of cards which usually requires three weeks to get cleared, according to Mr Hota.
"Personalisation (of cards) takes time because the name has to be embossed on the card. This is such a big order coming all of a sudden. Nobody expected that in one go so many accounts will be opened," he said.
However, he said the backlogs are likely to be cleared in next three weeks.
The scheme was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 28 with an aim to boost financial inclusion.
Under the Jan Dhan scheme, account holders will get an overdraft facility of Rs 5,000. They would also be provided with RuPay debit cards and Rs 1 lakh accident insurance cover.
The government has envisaged to provide bank accounts to 7.5 crore people by January 26.

CAIRO (AP) — Targeted killings in Libya over two days left 10 rights activists, journalists, and members of the security forces dead in the country's east, local security officials said Saturday.
Among the slain Thursday and Friday were two activist bloggers, and four current and former military and police officers. The officials said three other people who were targeted survived assassination attempts in the eastern city of Benghazi.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.
The identity of the assailants was not immediately known. Islamic radical militias, however, have been blamed for frequent killings of secular activists, judges, moderate clerics, policemen and soldiers in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city.
Libya is witnessing the worst bout of violence since the 2011 ouster of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Seat sharing row: Sena says take it or leave it  BJP leaves decision to ModiComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party in Maharashtra on Monday rejected ally Shiv Sena's 'final' offer of 119 seats, thus worsening the crisis in the saffron alliance.
BJP president Amit Shah called up Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and urged him not to break the 25-year old alliance, TV reports said. Shah also requested the Sena to rethink on seat sharing for the 288-member assembly polls.
This comes amid indications that the BJP  is readying a Plan B with state leaders telling Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they would rather go it alone than accept this.
Modi is now expected to attempt a reconciliation. In New Delhi, the BJP’s top brass took stock of the seat sharing talks, but kept its cards close to its chest.
After a meeting of its parliamentary board, Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah had a separate 10-minute-long meeting. The party remain tight-lipped about it.
The Sena has given the BJP a breather saying it would wait till Monday. The last date for filing nominations is September 27.
“Modi may not immediately sanction an extreme step and could try and convince the Sena chief,” said a BJP leader close to the developments.
For over a fortnight, the saffron combine has been squabbling over the formula for sharing the 288 assembly seats going to polls on October 15.
Earlier in the day, Thackeray speaking at his party’s national executive meeting in Mumbai, told a cheering crowd of Sainiks to prepare to go solo if the talks did not fructify.
In what his partymen saw as his best-ever public speech, Thackeray said his formula  -- of 151 seats for the Sena, 119 for the BJP and 18 for smaller allies --  was his last-ditch effort to save the alliance.
HT Analysis: Uddhav wary of BJP’s Maha ambitions
The BJP responded within the hour. “We fought 119 seats in 2009, even now they are offering us 119. How is this justified,” asked senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse. Talking in New Delhi, he said the two parties should reshuffle the 59 seats the Sena has not won in the past three elections and 19 the BJP had not won and then arrive at a figure.
“Also, these talks cannot take place through television. We need to sit face-to-face,” Khadse added, saying the BJP was still open to talks, putting the ball back into the Sena’s court. BJP insiders said the party had readied a list of 130 candidates and was waiting for word from the top leaders to release it.
In his speech, Thackeray criticised the present batch of BJP leaders reminding them of how the alliance, formed by LK Advani, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and Pramod Mahajan with the late Bal Thackeray, came together not for power but for Hindutva.
“We had differences of opinion with Mahajan and [Gopinath] Munde too. But our relationship never got strained like it has happened now. We both knew how much to stretch,” he said. He reminded Modi that the Shiv Sena stood by him during the riots in Gujarat.
He also warned the BJP against creating hurdles when a golden opportunity to win the state elections has arisen, just as they kept to the alliance dharma during the Lok Sabha polls.
The Sena chief did not hide his chief ministerial ambitions either. “If you are looking down on the Shiv Sena, then our sainiks are ready to fight back. Get ready to face consequences…. I promise to capture power in Maharashtra at any cost,” Thackeray said.
The state BJP  is bent on teaching the Sena a lesson, but the party’s central leadership thinks a break-up could mar the BJP’s credibility among other allies.
“Any decision needs to be taken with some solid foresight. No doubt that the Sena has us in a catch-22 position, but then we need to find a solution that will go a long away,” said a BJP leader.
While a decision to split has not yet been finalised, the break-up of this long-time friendship is sure to change the political map of Maharashtra for years to come.

Google in talks with Airtel to usher in carr...Google in talks with Airtel to usher in carrier billing

(If they join hands, then…)
BANGALORE: Internet giant Google is in talks with Airtel to allow customers of the country's largest mobile operator to pay for digital items such as e-books, paid apps and in-app purchases through their service provider.
In a country where millions of smartphone users do not use credit cards, such a tie-up can significantly boost Google's digital goods business, and app developers and content creators will end up earning more.
Two people aware of the talks said Google and Airtel are currently trying to come to an agreement on revenue sharing.
If they join hands, then Google can sell its apps and digital content to Airtel subscribers without having to collect banking details. Airtel has nearly 40 million data subscribers in India, of which 12.5 million are on 3G.
At present, Indian mobile users can pay for their purchases from Google's apps store Google Play through credit cards, debit cards or gift cards.
Experts say 'carrier billing', or the practice of allowing customers to charge their digital purchases directly to their phone bills, has huge potential to boost digital goods business in a place where very few people use credit cards, and many of those who do are not comfortable making digital payments.
"There's only 2% credit card penetration and that way the app economy doesn't make sense. Operator billing is incredibly seamless and has a much wider reach," said Vishal Anand , chief product officer at Newshunt, a news reading application provider that has tied up with mobile operators for carrier billing. Nearly 3.5 million e-books were downloaded on the app in less than five months and a large portion of it was paid for through carrier billing.
Google and Airtel are expected to announce a deal once they agree on revenue sharing and receive regulatory clearance. "Google was asking for as much as 90% of the revenues," one of them said.
Operators have been traditionally taking over 50% of the revenues. However, over the years, operators have been under pressure to pay out more to publishers and developers.
Recently, Vodafone made changes to its revenue sharing policy and said it will share revenues on a 70:30 basis in favour of the content creator.
"Earlier, operators did not realise the potential of such services and did not know how to have interactions with developers. But they have been hiring people with developer relations experience and that's a positive sign," said Sundar Lakshmanan, the co-founder of Ideophone Labs, which has worked with operators for some of its apps.
"If Airtel and Google team up, it can play a significant role in solving the payments problem," he said.
Microsoft has also announced its intention to launch a carrier billing solution for its Windows phone app store in India. The company, which has announced carrier billing deals with telecom operators in other markets such as the Middle East, has not announced any time frame for the India launch.
Google's digital goods and apps business is expected to bring in over $5 billion in revenues by 2017 worldwide.
Currently, it offers carrier billing option to customers in 26 countries, including the US, UK and Singapore. In June, it tied up with UAE-based telco Etisalat to offer carrier billing in the region.
In September last year, Estoniabased mobile payments company Fortumo tied up with Indian carriers, including Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and Tata DoCoMo, for carrier billing. It requires developers to integrate Fortumo to their application to enable carrier billing for in-app purchases.
Bangalore-based Ver Se (the makers of Newshunt), US-based Boku, Bango and venture-backed MoPay also offer carrier billing solutions in the country. In India, mobile operators are required to take a second consent from the user before selling any value-added service to the consumer.

Diesel subsidy phases out; petrol cars in hu...Long waiting periods for petrol cars as government phases out diesel subsidy

While production constraints and logistical problems may be the reasons for the long waiting periods, new trends also indicate changing consumer preference — now back to petrol cars as the government has phased out diesel subsidy.

Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: If you are planning to buy a petrol-driven car this Diwali, it may be too late to book one now. Some of the top-selling petrol car models have waiting periods running into months, more so for gearless models or one of the high-end versions. Booking now for a Diwali delivery may be almost impossible on such models.
While production constraints and logistical problems may be the reasons for the long waiting periods, new trends also indicate changing consumer preference — now back to petrol cars as the government has phased out diesel subsidy.
As the price difference between diesel and petrol has narrowed, lower cost of acquisition has started attracting buyers back to petrol cars. Even in a falling automobile market in the past two years, the huge price difference between the fuels had kept demand for diesel-powered cars much stronger, forcing automakers to rework their production strategies to focus on vehicles running on the heavier fuel.
As recently as six months ago, of every 10 car buyers, seven preferred diesel, according to Honda Cars India , the market leader in the mid-size sedan segment. But now, half of its customers want petrol cars, said Jnaneswar Sen, senior vicepresident of sales and marketing at the local Honda Motor unit.
Same is the case at the local unit of Korean car major Hyundai Motor. "Diesel vehicles are still seeing positive traction, but the growth will be led by new models and petrol-driven cars," said Rakesh Srivastava, senior vice-president of marketing and sales at Hyundai India.
If you want to buy a petrol-powered EcoSport, Ford Motor's topselling product in India, you may have to wait for about a month. And, if you want an automatic-transmission variant of the compact SUV, it may take two-three months to get the delivery, said Ford dealers ET spoke to.
But a diesel EcoSport may be in your garage without any waiting, depending on your region and choice of colour. That indicates a big change in customer preference. After Ford launched the SUV in 2013, the demand for the diesel variant was so high that the company had to slow down production of petrol EcoSport to meet diesel orders.
Automated manual transmission (AMT) — a clutch-less technology that combines the fuel efficiency of manual-transmission with the convenience of automatic cars — is becoming another demand driver. The waiting period on the AMT version of Maruti Suzuki's Celerio hatchback is more than 10 weeks, while its manual transmission variants are available for almost immediate delivery. No other vehicle from the nation's top car maker by volume has a waiting period, a company executive said.
For Honda City, the top-selling mid-size sedan, the waiting period is more than three months. This is also because the manufacturer recently halted production of the car because of a shift in its production units. Honda's recently launched multi-purpose vehicle Mobilio has a waiting period ranging between two and three months. The high-end variants of Honda's City and Amaze have longer waiting period. The City VX automatic may take four months to become yours, irrespective of the fuel option you prefer.
"Increasing traffic congestion and demand for smart features have given an impetus to sales of higher and automatic variants of vehicles," said Abdul Majeed, partner, automotive practices, at PwC.
At Hyundai Motor India , three cars have long waiting periods. The newly-launched premium hatchback i20 Elite has a waiting period of two to three months. While the i10 Grand diesel is immediately available, the petrol variant has a waiting period of up to one month. According to the company, compact sedan Xcent has a longer waiting period for petrol variant than diesel, ranging from four to five weeks.
Nissan has a waiting period on only one product, the Terrano SUV — it is around two weeks. Tata Motors' recently-launched hatchback Zest has over 10,000 bookings and the car fitted with the new Revotron engine has a waiting period of about four weeks. Delivery of the AMT diesel variant of the Zest may happen only after about three months.

NRIs make bulk purchases anticipating realty...Assocham
(Property markets in Bangalore, Ahmedabad and…)
MUMBAI | KOLKATA: Vinisha Khiara and her husband Gautam, hoteliers in the UAE, already own an apartment in their hometown Mumbai and are keen to invest in properties in India that would fetch them handsome return on investment (RoI) five years from now.
The enterprising couple, after some good research and bargaining, recently picked up three apartments in Bangalore. "Bulk investment offered us a good bargain along with one-time registration process and will also help in easy monitoring of properties going forward," says Vinisha. NRIs who have so far shown interest in buying properties in overseas markets, are now keen to invest in Indian real estate. They are making bulk purchases, getting decent discounts, and expecting good returns in anticipation of a revival in the market.
Property markets in Bangalore, Ahmedabad and outskirts of Mumbai, including Ambernath and Navi Mumbai , are generating good interest among buyers in the UAE, Singapore, the US and Canada .
Bulk buying is clearly helping both sides here as NRIs are getting discounts while developers, the much-needed liquidity. "For the buyer, a bulk purchase offers better discounts along with payment flexibility. Bulk buying or group purchase is always a welcome proposition for developers. Among the main reasons for that is the reduction in the cost of acquisition. Bulk buying helps increase turnover. More importantly, it helps timely execution of projects as cash flows are unhindered," says Jackbastian Nazareth, Group CEO at Puravankara Projects. "A depreciating rupee has also made properties in India cheaper for NRIs," he adds.
According to a recent Assocham survey, Indian property developers are anticipating a 35% rise in inquiries from NRIbased buyers against last year's about 18%.
"NRIs feel confident about the new government in India and are waiting for an investmentfriendly market in various fields," the study added. Sensing an opportunity of rising interest among NRIs to invest in Indian real estate, some developers have also set up exclusive sales offices in these regions.
"To tap the growing business opportunities from NRIs, we started an office in Dubai earlier this year. Given that our sales from the Dubai market alone have almost doubled, we are now looking at setting up offices in Singapore and Hong Kong in the next three months," says Gaurav Gupta, director of Omkar Realtors & Developers. The company has received 30 bookings from West Asia, mainly from Dubai in August alone.
With better sentiments, developers in markets like Bangalore, which is being seen as a most affordable one, have already started witnessing better sales from this segment. "Definitely yes, the interest from the NRI community is rising. Bookings by NRIs so far this year have already surpassed last year's number. Out of our total 82 bookings since April, around 25% have been from NRIs against 20% of last year's total sales," says Satish Shetty, head — Bangalore, Mittal Universal.
While there are NRIs who are buying properties in their respective hometowns due to emotional reasons, investors taking decisions based only on pure returns are also shifting their focus to India.
"With euphoria around the newly-elected Modi government , even hardcore NRI investors, who were so far investing in Central London and Manhattan, have started looking at Indian property markets," Gupta says. Despite the rupee's weakness against the US dollar , 2013 proved to be a lacklustre year for the realty sector, given that investor sentiment remained weak. However, post elections, the mood has turned optimistic, especially due to some announcements made by the government so far.
"This year (2014) has been significantly better and we are now close to achieving sales of 100,000 sq ft by December," says Shabeer Sait, executive head of operations at Irshads Property Matters that has major client base from overseas markets, mainly the UAE.
"With the announcement of 100 smart cities, hassle-free airports across tier-II cities to improve connectivity, etc., measures like these clearly show the government's intent on infrastructure push."
Among NRI investors, who are mostly the high-net worth types, professionals and industrialists, mid-segment projects are their favorites, while premium and high-end projects are being considered mostly for end-use, brokers say.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft is planning to go Indian big time, offering Bollywood movies and music on its latest Xbox One platform as well as EMI schemes to aggressively market the gaming console, which will be launched on an 'online exclusive' model in the country this week. While equated monthly installments (EMI) would be a global first along with online-only sales model for the software major, providing content such as local movies and music is a model Microsoft intends to replicate from developed markets. The company will tie up with local content aggregators to provide Bollywood movies and music, said Chakrapani Gollapali , country general manager for consumer channels group at Microsoft India .
It will follow the 'freemium' model where some content will be free of charge but consumers will have to pay for proprietary features, functionality or virtual goods.
On the EMI scheme, Gollapali said that at the Rs25,000-30,000 price point mark in India, a sizeable section of customers wants financing to be made available.
Microsoft is launching the Xbox One in India only on Amazon , pre-orders for which began in mid-August, taking a cue from companies such as USbased Motorola and China's Xiaomi, which sell their smartphones exclusively through websites.
The standalone Xbox will be available for Rs39,990, while the model with Kinect, an interface that allows the use of gestures to play games, will cost Rs45,990. Microsoft did not share the number of pre-orders so far, saying that 70% of them from India were for the Kinect variant. The software giant pegs the Indian market on a par with Spain or Italy in terms of gaming spending, with the potential of reaching the size of Germany and breaking into the top 15-20 countries by 2016-17.
"Gaming and entertainment industry (in India) is close to $11 billion, of which gaming is $1 billion, making it a fascinating launch market for Xbox One," said Gollapali. The estimate includes gaming on smartphones. According to estimates from international games-market research firm NewZoo, which tracks and ranks countries based on gaming revenue, India is still on the fringe of the top 20 with about $307 million revenue in 2014.
The US leads with $20 billion in gaming revenue, followed by China and Japan, with about $17 billion and $12 billion revenues, respectively. European markets, including Germany, Italy and Spain stack up in the top 10 with revenue between $1 billion and $3 billion. Xbox One has sold 5 million units largely in the US and European markets since its launch in January this year.

Tens of thousands of activists walked through Manhattan on Sunday, warning that climate change is destroying the Earth in stride with demonstrators around the world who urged policymakers to take quick action.
Starting along Central Park West, most came on foot, others with bicycles and walkers, and some even in wheelchairs. Many wore costumes and marched to drumbeats. One woman played the accordion.
But their message was not entertaining.
“We’re going to lose our planet in the next generation if things continue this way,” said Bert Garskof, 81, as a family member pushed his wheelchair through Times Square.
Organizers said more than 100,000 marched in New York, including actors Mark Ruffalo and Evangeline Lilly. They were joined in midtown Manhattan by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, former Vice President Al Gore and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.
On Tuesday, more than 120 world leaders will convene for the United Nations Climate Summit aimed at galvanizing political will for a new global climate treaty by the end of 2015.
“I am overwhelmed by such a strong power, energy and voice of people,” Mr. Ban told reporters. “I hope this voice will be truly reflected to the leaders when they meet on September 23rd. Climate change is (a) defining issue of our time and there is no time to lose. If we do not take action now, we will have to pay much more.
Mr. De Blasio said, “My sense is the energy you see on the streets, the numbers that have amassed here and in other cities around the world, show that something bigger is going on, and this U.N. summit will be one of the ones where we look back and say it was a difference maker,” Mr. de Blasio said.
The New York march was one of a series of events held around the world to raise awareness about climate change.
In London, organizers said 40,000 marchers participated, while a small gathering in Cairo featured a huge art piece representing wind and solar energy. In Rio de Janeiro, marchers with green hearts painted on their faces rallied at Ipanema Beach.
Celebrities in London including actress Emma Thompson and musician Peter Gabriel joined thousands of people crossing the capital’s centre, chanting- “What do we want? Clean energy. When do we want it? Now.”
“This is important for every single person on the planet, which is why it has to be the greatest grassroots movement of all time,” Ms. Thompson said. “This is the battle of our lives. We’re fighting for our children.”
In New York, a contingent came from Moore, Oklahoma, where a massive tornado killed 24 people last year, as did hundreds of people affected by Superstorm Sandy, which the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the British meteorological office said was made more likely by climate change.
In Australia, the largest rally was in Melbourne, where an estimated 10,000 people took to the streets with banners and placards calling on their government to do more to combat global warming.
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was a particular target of the protesters in major Australian cities. Mr. Abbott’s centre-right coalition has removed a carbon tax and has restricted funding for climate change bodies since coming to power last year.

CHEQUE BOUNCING: NEW PRECEDENTTweet
Published on Mon, Sep 22,2014 | 07:39, Updated at Mon, Sep 22 at 15:54Source : CNBC-TV18 |   Watch Video :
40 lakh cases in India have to do with bounced cheques – making it one of the most litigious matters in the country. Which is why in April this year the Supreme Court laid down specific guidelines for all magisterial courts to speedily dispose of cheque bouncing cases. But that good work may soon be undone. Another Supreme Court decision has overturned the existing precedent on where a cheque bounce case can be filed. In doing so, has the apex court swung the pendulum in favor of the defaulting party? Payaswini Upadhyay finds out.
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act makes cheque bouncing a criminal offence with imprisonment up to two years or fine which may extend to twice the cheque amount or both.
Until recently, the existent precedent on Section 138 was the SC’s landmark judgment by a 2 judge bench in the case of Bhaskaran. In 1999, this judgment laid down that the following 5 acts linked together will qualify as an offence under Section 138; namely
1.    Drawing of the cheque
2.    Presentation of the cheque to the bank
3.    Returning the cheque unpaid by the drawee bank
4.    Giving notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque demanding payment of the cheque amount
5.    Failure of the drawer to make payment within 15 days of the receipt of the notice.
The judgment laid down that any court within whose jurisdiction any of these 5 acts are committed will have the jurisdiction to hear the case.
Tushad Cooper
Advocate, Bombay HC
“The impact of Bhaskaran was that it gave a great fillip to complainants who were holding cheques which had bounced owing to litigants dishonestly handing over such cheques and in my view, it was fully in conformity with the intent of the legislature which was brought in 1998-89 to encourage the use of cheques in commercial transactions.”   
Aman Lekhi
Senior Advocate, Supreme Court
“Bhaskaran’s case did require reconsideration because it was too open-winded to actually work as a precedent and facilitate effective prosecution under Section 138 because of the sheer number of options it gave to a person instituting the proceedings. It did not appropriately consider the options of the CrPC in so far as the place for institutional proceedings are concerned and in my opinion, rather incorrectly, telescoped into the criminal law aspects of civil law and parts of cause of action. So there was a need and occasion to reconsider Bhaskaran.”
Recently, in the Dashrath Rathod case, a 3 judge bench of Supreme Court had another opportunity to decide which court will have the jurisdiction to hear a dishonor of cheque case. The bench noted that the precedent that Bhaskaran set led to manipulative abuse of territorial jurisdiction.
And so, the 3 judge bench overturned the Bhaskaran precedent.
The Supreme Court relied on Section 178 of the Criminal Procedure Code to say that territorial jurisdiction in criminal matters lies solely at the location where the offence is committed. It noted that an offence under Section 138 will take place if the drawee bank returns the cheque unpaid and the court where this bank is located and the cheque is dishonored will have the jurisdiction to hear the case.  
Aman Lekhi
Senior Advocate, Supreme Court
“The SC notices that the purpose of this enactment i.e. Section 138 was to give efficacy to cheques because the mischief that was sought to be addressed was the practice of issuing cheques without any responsibility and the payee was not getting the money. Now that was the objective. Now when you interpret the statute, you have to interpret it keeping the objective in mind so that you don’t frustrate the purpose. The peculiar remedy which the SC has given requires the payee to follow the drawer and institute proceedings where the drawer’s bank is situated which renders the proceedings onerous.”
Tushad Cooper
Advocate, Bombay HC
“In this case, cheques will be issued by a debtor from a remote jurisdiction and thereafter compel the complainant or the creditor to move to the remote jurisdiction in order to assert his right. The answer given the judgment is that it is always open to the complainant to take recourse to the regular Indian Penal Code for cheating if the person can establish that the cheque was given with a dishonest intent to cheat. But that according to me would not be fair. The intent of the legislature embodying Section 138 was precisely to give a complainant an additional remedy and not leave the complainant to the sole recourse of the IPC. By arguing that he has recourse under IPC and doesn’t deserve further remedy under the negotiable instruments act in my view would not be correct.”
The judgment impacts not just prospective but pending cases as well. The Supreme Court has said that in cases where evidence has been recorded, the same court can continue to hear the case. For others cases, including ones where the accused had not been given proper notice, the complaint would have to be heard by the court where the offence took place. Experts say that is a recipe for further confusion and prolonged litigation! Looks like the cheque dishonor case clogging that has the apex court worried is not clearing up anytime soon.

Mandolin Shrinivas passes awayCarnatic musician Mandolin U. Srinivas. (file photo)
September 19, 2014:  
Child prodigy-turned-master musician Mandolin U. Shrinivas (45) passed away on September 19, 2014 following a failed liver transplant.
Hailing from Palakol in Andhra Pradesh, Uppalapu Shrinivas, born on February 28, 1969, showed an uncanny interest in his father Sathyanarayana's mandolin at a very young age. He stormed the Carnatic music scene with his first public performance in 1978 and since then there was no looking back.
Known for having adapted a difficult electric western instrument to the Carnatic stage with awe-inspiring success, Shrinivas impressed pundits and lay listeners alike. He was the recipient of prestigious awards such as the Padma Shri and the Sangeet Natak Akademi award.
Apart from traditional Carnatic concerts, Shrinivas was a favourite with other well-known global artistes such as John McLaughlin, Michael Nyman and Michael Brook. His familiarity with crossover genres made him an automatic choice. He distinguished himself in collaborations with artistes of the calibre of Zakir Hussain, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Sivamani, Vikku Vinaykram and Dominique Piazza.
Shrinivas is survived by his father and brother Mandolin U. Rajesh.
Music historian V. Sriram reports:
It is not often that it is given to someone to introduce a new instrument into a traditional art such as Carnatic Music and yet be welcomed with open arms. The violin took over a century to become mainstream. Mandolin U Shrinivas was a sensation. His debut in Madras as a cherubic youngster in the 1980s was phenomenal. The first performance was at the Indian Fine Arts Society closely followed by one at the Sri Krishna Gana Sabha where even veterans such as Semmangudi praised him. He became a star and remained one, taking the mandolin to unforeseen heights.
And yet, in his dealings with people he was humility personified. That he should have passed away when the greatest of honours were yet to come his way only shows that we as music lovers are an unfortunate lot. Truly those whom the Gods love die young.

Deerfield drugmaker defies anti-inversion effort24
Republicans argue that a targeted attack on inversions would be counterproductive and the focus should be on the broader rewrite of the tax code. The retroactive part of the Democrats' plan is particularly controversial. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently produced a television ad attacking the idea, showing airplanes and automobiles traveling in reverse.
A bill submitted in the House by Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., would deny the tax benefit of inversions after May 8 to companies that merge with a foreign company, unless the foreign company's shareholders end up with more than 50 percent of the combined company. Under current law, that threshold is 20 percent. In the Horizon transaction, the Vidara shareholders got about 26 percent.
The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, estimates the Levin bill would preserve $19.5 billion in otherwise lost tax revenue over the next 10 years.
Theravance Inc., a South San Francisco, California-based drugmaker, got a Cayman Islands address for its research division when it spun the unit off as Theravance Biopharma Inc. in June. That transaction was made possible by a section of the tax code that wouldn't be affected by the Levin bill.
Horizon doesn't foresee paying significant taxes until 2016, Carey said, because of the impact of net operating losses the company has accumulated. Absent the Vidara transaction, the company's tax rate would have been in the high 30's once it started paying, Horizon said in March. With the Vidara transaction, it will be in the “low 20's or lower.”
Carey said he and Horizon's other top executives will remain in Deerfield, a Chicago suburb, while board and executive committee meetings will take place in Ireland. The combined company has more than 500 employees.
Vidara was founded in 2011 by Bala Venkataranam, a former pharmaceuticals executive who now runs a private investment firm in an Atlanta suburb. Most of Vidara's 24 employees are based near Atlanta or elsewhere in the United States, Carey said. Some “five to eight” of Vidara's employees are in Ireland, Carey said.
Separate from the legislative proposals, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is working on regulations to limit the tax advantages of inversions. He said this week he expected to take action “very very soon.”

Why I March: We Need To Leave The Oil In The Ground!reddit
My name is Patricia Gualinga. I am the international relations coordinator for the Kichwa First People of Sarayaku in the Ecuadorian Amazon. I have had the opportunity to travel around the world, in addition to helping my people and fighting alongside my siblings, parents, and entire community.
I'm traveling to New York for many events around the UN General Assembly, including the People's Climate March. These are spaces where the world's governments come together to discuss issues of transcendental importance for indigenous peoples. Though our governments need to assume their proper responsibilities, often in these meetings there is no progress. One major aspiration of my trip is that our participation helps encourage some advancement.
As women, we are mothers, sisters, wives, daughters and friends. We are very sensitive to feeling what happens around us. Women have a close relationship to the Earth because everything we are comes from the Earth's powers. I'm certain through our songs and dreams, we can ensure that our strength is felt by governments so that they make good decisions. This is important because they are currently making bad decisions that put humanity at risk.
Brothers and sisters, we're calling out to the world to join together for true change. Let's leave the oil beneath the ground. The Sarayaku indigenous people believe that instead of bringing 'development,' the oil industry is destructive for indigenous society, non-indigenous society, the planet, and nature. It disrupts our indigenous worldview and destroys our ecosystems. That's why we vociferously fight so that oil is not extracted from our territories.
If we continue preying on the Earth under the banner of the oil economy, we put at risk both our lives and that of the planet. Mother Earth is tired of so much abuse and ill-treatment. Now is the time to put on the brakes, to say, "this is the limit, we can't continue this way."
This isn't just the fight of indigenous peoples or Sarayaku. It's the fight of everyone, because the air we all breathe doesn't have borders. Water doesn't have borders. While we humans place political borders, the Earth is a unified entity. And the consequences of pollution are affecting everyone.
The Sarayaku people are launching our proposal for Kausak Sacha, or the Living Forest. This includes not just animals and biodiversity, but also the spirits that are in charge of protecting those ecosystems -- making sure the rivers don't dry up, that there is abundant biodiversity, that the forest regenerates. But these spirits don't have a representative voice in urban society, and they are disappearing little by little. Before they disappear completely, we want the living forests within indigenous territories to be globally recognized as untouchable, sacred, and protected patrimony of biodiversity. We're not talking about national parks, we're not talking about something where the Plan B allows for oil exploitation. We're talking about something that lasts in perpetuity, as an inheritance for future generations.
Let's join forces and change our way of seeing the world. True wealth is found within our Amazon that contributes oxygen and life. In the call to leave oil below the ground, let's start with those who are resisting and maintaining our worldview as indigenous peoples. We won't allow continued disregard from the oil industry, which aims only to generate economic profits. We can generate a much more lasting benefit -- the general good of building an alternative that favors all life.

Not a simple no from ScotlandUpdated: September 20, 2014 00:19 IST
Not a simple ‘no’ from Scotland
government
It would be prudent not to read Scotland’s ‘no’ to independence as a plain and simple ‘yes’ to continue with the status quo. The latest verdict is very unlike the ‘no’ vote in the 2011 nation-wide referendum, which may have almost indefinitely deferred the search for an alternative to the first-past-the-post mode of election of members of Parliament in Westminster. This result is more complex than the 55-45 per cent vote to stay in the union may point to: an outcome that is far more spectacular than any that pollsters had predicted. More than two out of every five Scots have voted to leave the United Kingdom, and so has their biggest city, Glasgow. Nobody understands what all of this means, better than the so-called Better Together campaign that was led by all the three mainstream parties at Westminster. In a desperate and last-ditch effort to save the union, all of them promised a great deal more of devolution of powers during the passionate debate prior to the referendum. The ruling Conservatives recognise that the time to redeem their pledge to voters begins now. The constitutional process that would eventually culminate in substantial transfer of powers, whatever the details, would take years. But Alex Salmond and his Scottish Nationalist Party can be expected to keep up the pressure in the run-up to the 2015 general elections. The future shape of Scotland will undoubtedly have implications for the rest of the regions, and indeed for the very nature of the union.
There is no denying also that the referendum carries a larger significance beyond the borders of the British Isles. Unmistakable — and probably uncharacteristic for an outsider — was the outspoken comment by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. He recently told Parliament that the Scottish referendum was a ‘torpedo’ against European integration, and warned potential breakaway states aspiring to European Union membership of a cold reception. There is a context to Mr. Rajoy’s cryptic comments, which contrast with the milder, if sympathetic, support from U.S. President Barack Obama for a united Britain. Madrid, which has long faced a secessionist movement in the Basque region, is now bracing itself for a non-binding independence plebiscite in the affluent Catalonia province on November 9. Clearly, the currents of globalisation of the recent decades — or closer regional integration as in the case of Europe — have, to a greater or lesser degree, reignited the embers of nationalism and still more narrowly-based identities. An effective political counter to this resurgence could only lie in an inclusive order that can embrace and accommodate diversity.

Shiv Sena-BJP tussle over seats only for CM s post: Narayan RaneCongress had "half a dozen" leaders who were capable of becoming the Chief Minister, Rane said
PTI | Mumbai | Posted: September 21, 2014 5:03 pm
Congress leader and Maharashtra Industries Minister Narayan Rane Sunday said the tug of war between Shiv Sena and BJP over seat-sharing was for the Chief Minister’s post, but neither party had a candidate for the top job in the state.
Talking to reporters at Aurangabad, Rane said, “All this (tussle between Sena and BJP) is for personal and selfish interests, when both parties do not have a single capable person to lead the state.”
Congress had “half a dozen” leaders who were capable of becoming the Chief Minister, he said, adding that the current logjam over seat-sharing between Congress and NCP was only about number of seats and not about the CM’s post.
Congress was ready to give 124 seats (out of the 288 seats of Maharashtra Assembly) to NCP, he said.
“The first list of Congress candidates would be released in two days. It is my personal view that the Congress-NCP alliance should continue, in the interest of the state as well as both the parties,” he said.
Earlier, Rane, who is the campaign committee chief of the state Congress for the next month’s Assembly elections, and Ashok Chavan, who is the co-ordination committee head, addressed a meeting of party workers from Marathwada region. Rane said during the campaign, Congress will highlight the “double-speak” of BJP and NDA government’s failure to check price rise.
“The Modi wave has now receded, as was shown in the by-elections. A wave is never permanent and whatever little is left of the wave, it won’t benefit the Sena-BJP in Maharashtra,” he claimed.

NSG writes to SPG to enhance VVIP security skillsThe counter-terror force which is securing 15 VVIPs at present has asked SPG, which protects the Prime Minister and his immediate family, to "audit" its functioning and give its commandos some tips.
PTI | Posted: September 21, 2014 5:56 pm | Updated: September 21, 2014 5:58 pm
NSG commandos, who guard some of the most high-risk VVIPs in the country, are set to sharpen their skills in this domain with the elite force asking the Special Protection Group to audit its performance and share expertise in better securing its protectees.
The counter-terror force which is securing 15 VVIPs at present has asked SPG, which protects the Prime Minister and his immediate family, to “audit” its functioning and give its commandos some tips to operate in a smarter and swifter manner.
This is the first time the force is getting an assessment done of its VVIP security duties, and, officials said, the idea was mooted by NSG chief Jayanto N Choudhury after he took over the reins of the ‘black cats’ few months ago.
“SPG which secures the Prime Minister and his family works under an Act of the Union. They perform their duty of ensuring proximate security to the VVIPs with utmost swiftness.
“It was felt necessary that NSG needs to learn more and hence, it has written to SPG to assess its functioning in the VVIP security domain,” the officials said.
The ‘black cats’ of the force, at present, guard 15 ‘Z+’ category VVIPs which includes Home Minister Rajnath Singh, BJP patriarch L K Advani, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, her Uttar Pradesh counterpart Akhilesh Yadav, besides Chief Ministers Raman Singh (Chhattisgarh), Parkash Singh Badal (Punjab), Tarun Gogoi (Assam), BSP chief Mayawati, NC President Farooq Abdullah, DMK chief K Karunanidhi and S P chief Mulayam Singh Yadav among others.
The officials said NSG wants to bring its security drills and protocols on par with what is rendered by SPG so that there is a “fool proof” security for its protectees.
“This is a rare collaboration between the two special security units of the country. Under this exchange, which is expected to happen soon, both the forces stand to gain,” they said.
They said after the government recently made it clear that no more VVIPs would put under NSG cover, the force is aiming to render the “topmost” level of security to these leaders who move across the country for their public engagements.
“May be some more drills will be added to NSG operating procedures post this interaction,” the officials said.
They said as SPG functions under an Act, it has better resources and manpower to render its duties and this is what NSG would want to add as its role differs from that of SPG.
‘Black cat’ commandos only secure a VVIP during travel and not when he or she is at a location.

Love Commandos  counters the concept of Love JihadPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 21, 2014 12:07 pm
At a time when the country is being exposed to an oxymoronic term ‘love jihad’, countering such a concept is an organisation with an equally paradoxical name called ‘Love Commandos’.
With a vision of uniting love birds who have attained the legal age of marriage, Love Commandos claimed to have united over 30,000 couple in a short spell of four years.
“We want lovers to unite no matter which caste, community, religion or place they come from. There should be a society where love prevails over everything,” says Chairman of Love Commandos, Sanjoy Sachdev.
The voluntary organisation, which mainly operates in Delhi from its office in Paharganj area, claims to provide protection to couples and guards them from the wrath of their angry parents, families or police, helps them fight harassment and give them shelter so they can marry freely.
“Our organisation started on July 2010 after we helped a couple in Delhi to unite after the boy was falsely charged by the girl’s family and had registered a police case against him,” says Sachdev.
Its feisty, relentless fight for the cause of love continues unabated despite paucity of funds as one of its shelter homes operates as the group’s makeshift office.
It prefers to exist in perpetual liminality thinking too much visibility might lead to exposure of the eloped lovers.
“There are police cases lodged against many people whom we are helping and there are several groups who do not want us to continue with our activity,” claims Sachdev, adding the circumstances often compels the organisation to constantly keep shifting their shelter homes.
The organisation has two helpline numbers that ring simultaneously in twelve cities across the country and on receiving a valid call for help the commandos swing into action.
Even though they only have seven permanent shelter homes across Delhi and NCR, the group sets up temporary shelter homes in other parts of the country whenever the need arises.
“If a couple needs assistance at place other than Delhi or NCR, we set up a shelter home nearby that area till the time we rehabilitate them,” says Sachdev.
Although the organisation was functioning under severe financial crush, it has refrained from asking any help from the government, he says.
“It is becoming very difficult to operate with the soaring price of food, water, electricity, etc. We receive donations from people. Even legendary tennis player Bjorn Borg had donated to us twice.”
He also alleges hostilities by police against the love birds accusing them of filing cases coming under pressure from their parties involved. “In some cases, families lodged FIR of kidnapping and rape against the boys even when the decision to marry or elope was a consensual one. The police often do not crosscheck.”
The cause of prejudice against love marriage in India is due to the deep-cited problems of caste and religion, says Rajwant Kaur, a Ph.D Scholar in Sociology department in JNU.
“Indian society is mainly divided on the basis of caste and religion which is why parents do not allow love marriages, says Kaur.
Apart from that the problem of continued…

BJP may go alone in Maharashtra polls, ties with Shiv Sena in trouble

New Delhi: There seems to be no end to the seat sharing tussle between Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). BJP's Parliamentary Board met late on Sunday for a  brainstorming session on the way forward in the Maharashtra polls.
According to sources, the BJP is ready to fight the Maharashtra polls alone but they want to wait to salvage the alliance with Shiv Sena. In a last ditch effort, Shiv Sena offered 119 seats to BJP and 18 to other allies keeping 151 for itself out of 288. The BJP is unhappy with the proposal as the contested on 119 seats in 2009 Assembly elections too.
Hoping for a fresh round of talks with the Sena leadership, BJP Maharashtra leaders are expected to go to Mumbai on Monday morning. Both in Delhi and Mumbai, BJP and Sena shortlisted candidates for the polls but refrained from announcing the list.
As a reminder to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uddhav said that it was Sena's Bal Thackeray who backed him after the Godhra riots.

"It was decided that efforts should be made to ensure that there is a respectable and mature understanding on seat- sharing and the alliance is kept intact. BJP wants to go to the polls along with Sena and other alliance partners," BJP incharge for Maharashtra Rajiv Pratap Rudy said after the marathon meeting of the party's Central Election Committee (CEC).
The CEC is understood to have shortlisted 120 candidates out of a list of over 180 candidates that were discussed. This was followed by an informal meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Board to discuss the strategy in the wake of Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray pegging seats for BJP at 119.
Both the meetings, which went on for over three hours, were attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah, who spent some time together separately, and other leaders.
Shah is believed to have spoken to Thackeray in the midst of the BJP meets, but there was no official word on it. Some BJP leaders made it clear that the party was ready to fight the polls on its own if Sena is unrelenting. BJP said there was "nothing new" in Sena's final offer and hoped seat-sharing issue can be mutually settled.
Though there is pressure from the cadres from the state to go it alone in the polls, the BJP said that it wants to continue with the alliance.
The BJP also reminded Sena that while the former has always sacrificed for the latter, the party has never returned the favour. "BJP-Shiv Sena alliance is very old. Seat sharing needs to be such that Congress is defeated. Such issues need to be discussed face to face," BJP leader Vinod Tawde said.
"We can give BJP 119 seats to the BJP and 18 to other smaller parties. BJP's OP Mathur was trying to negotiate on seats. I reminded them they are not givers but takers on this land. We are making a last attempt to save the alliance. Regardless of whether alliance stays or not, we will fight everywhere. Victory will be ours," Thackeray had said.
As a reminder to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uddhav said that it was Sena's Bal Thackeray who backed him after the Godhra riots.
Making an emotional pitch, Thackeray said, "The BJP-Sena alliance is not about seats. It is about the Hindutva ideology. BJP and Sena have been united over that ideology. There was a time when people wanted to remove Narendra Modi. LK Advani had consulted Balasaheb. It was Balasaheb who said that if you remove Modi, Gujarat will be finished."

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Indian Muslims will live for India, die for India" remark has evoked reactions from political leaders across the party lines.
Reacting to Modi's remark, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, "A lot of what Modi says is idealist, I wish he would say the same to Adityanath, Sadhvi Pargya as a lot of what they say is hypocritical."
On al Qaeda head Al Zawahiri's video message directed towards India and warning about creating a similar outfit in the country to "free Muslims from the oppression they face", PM Modi had said that the terror outfit is delusional if its leaders think that Indian Muslims will dance to their tune.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Indian Muslims will live for India, die for India" remark has evoked reactions from political leaders across the party lines.
"Indian Muslims will live for India, they will die for India. They will not want anything bad for India," he said in the world exclusive interview on CNN.

Kolkata: The West Bengal government on Sunday decided to form a panel to investigate the recent case of alleged harassment of girl student in Jadavpur University, which has rocked the campus with students demanding the Vice Chancellor's resignation.
Announcing this, state Higher Education Minister Partha Chatterjee, who went to the girl's residence on Sunday, said the inquiry committee was being formed under the directive of the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
"Members of the probe panel would be requested to submit report within 72 hours as desired by the CM," he said. Chatterjee said that the committee would be formed by the department of education with three or four members, names of whom would be made public on Monday.
The girl, who lodged complaint of sexual harassment, can appear before the committee and give her views.

The girl, who lodged complaint of sexual harassment, can appear before the committee and give her views.
Even though Jadavpur University had formed a probe panel to investigate into the case, students gheraoed the VC, registrar and other members of the executive council on the intervening night of September 16 and September 17 demanding a fresh probe panel to investigate the alleged sexual harassment of the girl inside the campus on August 28.
After Chatterjee visited the girl's residence, her father said that the minister had assured him that they would get 'justice'.
"The minister told me that we will get justice. We repose faith in what he said," the father told newspersons outside their Salt Lake residence.
The minister then went to meet the Governor at Raj Bhavan and stayed there for nearly one hour and 20 minutes.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW: O Destinyits beauty lies in the eye of the consolerComments
By Christopher Byrd September 21
EDITOR’S NOTE: Starting today, Style will occasionally offer video-game reviews. Here is the first one, from freelance contributor Christopher Byrd, for the new game DESTINY.

DESTINY
Reviewed by Christopher Byrd
Over the summer, I was one of the millions of players who explored the russet-colored landscape of Old Russia, with its scrap-metal fields and weather-worn industrial structures reclaimed by nature. Like my console-owning comrades the world over, I was as much a digital tourist as an unpaid minion, since the purpose of the alpha test in June, and the beta test in July, was to help the professionals at Bungie Inc. stress-test the network code for Destiny, their new sci-fi shooter. (Destiny is the studio’s first major game since Halo Reach. Bungie sold the rights of the Halo franchise to Microsoft.)
Although such tests are not uncommon for games built for the PC, they represent an emerging trend in console-game development. Anyone who remembers the disastrous rollout of last year’s Grand Theft Auto Online — which was initially plagued with server issues that made it difficult to initiate an extended-play session, let alone sustain one — will know why companies whose fortunes rest on providing an inviting online experience can benefit from allowing the public to sample their game ahead of its official release.
Of course, the oft-cited risk of such a ploy is that customers who might have been intrigued by a game’s potential while in development might be turned off by the actual experience. I was a part of this contingent — so much so that I canceled my pre-order of Destiny, which had been my key to the beta. (The alpha was open to PlayStation 4 owners who registered at bungie.net.) My reasons were not based on any technical hiccups—in my experience, everything worked just fine–but on how the game ruffled my sensibilities as a writer, a sense that didn’t come as unexpected.
My doubts about Destiny first emerged after I watched interviews with Bungie’s developers, who—though they were as enthusiastic and bright-eyed about the project—seemed unable to articulate what would set it apart from other shooters. That Destiny would knit the divide between cooperative and competitive play by allowing players to move easily between the game’s story mode—which can be tackled with other players—and its suite of player-vs.-player options seemed a rather minor selling point to me, since such other types of games as Demon’s Souls and GTA V had already done similar things.
Fans celebrated at a party in London for the launch of the new video game, Destiny, which has reportedly set an industry record for the most expensive video game ever made. (Reuters)
Even with my low expectations, I was caught unawares by the desultory writing on display in the alpha. The Golden Globe-winning “Game of Thrones” actor Peter Dinklage, who voices the player’s A.I. companion known as a Ghost, briefly became a target of online jesting after players seized upon a particularly bad line spoken by his character—“That wizard came from the moon!”—and elevated it to meme status before it was cut from the beta. (Give Bungie props: It took the mockery in stride and immortalized the line on a T-shirt, the proceeds of which went to charity.)
If all this talk about narrative quality seems somewhat recherché for a discussion about an entertainment product that has game-play mechanics consisting of shooting critters with different weapons across various environmental backdrops, I would say: Consider how numerous first-person shooters over the past decade (BioShock, Spec Ops: The Line, Wolfenstein: The New Order, etc.) have attended to their players’ intellects, as well their trigger fingers. You will learn more in the first five minutes about the psychological makeup of your protagonist and what everyday life is like for the survivors of a cataclysmic event playing Metro 2033 or Metro: Last Light, which are set in post-apocalyptic Moscow, than you ever would stomping around Old Russia in Destiny, or any of its other interplanetary precincts. And if you’re in a less serious mood, odds are better that you’ll laugh more playing a game like Borderlands 2, which knowingly jokes around with video conventions, than you ever would playing Destiny — a game whose RPG-like mechanics bear a close resemblance to it.
So Destiny (which grossed more than $325 million worldwide in its first five days) is a humorless, emotionally un-inflective, cliché-ridden space opera that I probably wouldn’t have played unless someone paid me to, but guess what? My appreciation for the game grew over the dozens of hours I played it. Perhaps the fault lay not in its stars, but in me.
The opening cut-scene of Destiny sums up what the game is about: A space pod lands on Mars and a group of astronauts emerges. The astronauts scale a rocky incline that overlooks an expansive vista, above which hovers a huge, celestial entity. A mellifluous, male voice-over informs us that the being in question is known as the Traveler, and that its discovery ushered in a golden age for humanity in which human life-spans increased, and a technological renaissance facilitated voyage to deeper parts of the galaxy.
This epoch ended after a force known as the Darkness found the Traveler, which it had been hunting for time immemorial. The period that followed was known as the Collapse. The survivors of this calamity and their descendants later took refuge at the City—the only place on Earth where a much-weakened Traveler could shroud humanity from the Darkness. From there, the game cuts to Old Russia, where we see a floating robot—a Ghost voiced by Dinklage—searching for someone who turns out to be you. Without going into too much detail, he tells you that your character has been dead for a long time and though you might have questions, for now they are best set aside. The important thing to know is that you are a Guardian, and that you have been resurrected to help heal the Traveler and repel the Darkness.
The game allows players to choose from among three races — human; Awoken, a pale, vampire-like people; and Exo, a species of sentient robots—and three classes that loosely align with the classic RPG trinity of knight, thief and mage. In Destiny, that breaks down to strongly armored Titans, nimble Hunters and spell-casting Warlocks. (I chose Warlocks.) From there, the player is tasked with conducting basic reconnaissance missions around Old Russia that soon lead to the discovery of a spaceship. Blasting the aliens that impede you earns experience points, which are used to level up your character and unlock different abilities. Once you have achieved Level 5 (which should take no more than two hours), you gain access to the Crucible, Destiny’s player-vs.-player hub, where you can engage in 3-vs.-3, or 6-vs.-6 team battles, as well as 6-vs.-6 battles in which players try to seize and hold on to specific areas of playfield, and every-person-for-themselves skirmishes.
Once you hit Level 20, you gain access to the Heroic modifier, which allows you to revisit previous areas and significantly ramp up the challenge, as well as to the Strike Playlists, which allow players to challenge difficult foes. Upon achieving Level 26, you gain access to the game’s Raids, which allow teams of up to 6 players to challenge the game’s most difficult foes in matches that can take up to 10 hours.
For anyone who’s spent time with Halo, Destiny’s shooting mechanics will feel second nature. Perforating enemies to weaken their shields, then finishing them off with a melee attack, is as fluid as it ever was in Bungie’s old franchise. Ditto, zipping around the map on a Sparrow—a shameless ripoff of the Star Wars speeder biker, which also calls to mind the vehicles in Halo known as Ghosts. One feature that Halo veterans who are particularly keen on multi-player may miss is the ability to customize matches—i.e., choose what weapons and vehicles are available for use—as well as the Forge feature, introduced in Halo 4, that allows players to customize the map. That said, Bungie has promised a steady rollout of updates, and I would be shocked if more options for customization were not offered.
Like other reviewers, I sped through the game’s story mode with an eye trained on my deadline. Because I haven’t been particularly drawn to competitive multi-player since the days of Halo 2, I spent a fair amount of time replaying the story missions to build up my character. In gaming lingo, this is known as “grinding.” It’s usually considered a chore, though before I hit Level 20 in Destiny, I never experienced it as such. Why?
Well, it all goes back to those astronauts in the game’s intro. After I completed the story missions, I revisited the Moon, Venus and Mars, where I skirted past alien patrols to gaze, unbothered, upon strange symbols scratched into walls, wiry-looking structures of unknown purpose, pools of iridescent liquids pockmarking the ground, and the like. I experienced a small epiphany inside of a structure on Mars when I noticed a wall that shimmered like a piece of corrugated metal. When I approached it from an angle, I saw that it was actually a window that looked out onto several buildings. I paused and considered how many hours must have gone into producing this little effect, which could easily be brushed over in the rush to complete an objective. Then I considered how in a different context—say, with Mario Kart 8 or the widely praised throwback Shovel Knight—writers of my ilk might lavish praise upon a game’s atmosphere because we know it’s not trying to tell us a grand story, but rather to evoke something else, like glee.
Destiny is a game about traversing beautiful places that offers up humble compensation for the fact that we will likely not travel to distant planets in our lifetimes. There is something of import in that most simple of ideas.

NASA s MAVEN enters Mars orbitNASA's MAVEN enters Mars orbit
By AFP | 22 Sep, 2014, 08.37AM IST
Next, MAVEN will enter a six-week phase for tests. Then, it begins a one-year mission of studying the gases in Mars's upper atmosphere and how it interacts with the sun and solar wind.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: NASA's MAVEN spacecraft began orbiting Mars on Sunday, on a mission to study how the Red Planet's climate changed over time from warm and wet to cold and dry.
"Based on observed navigation data, congratulations. MAVEN is now in orbit," said Dave Folta of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.
The unmanned orbiter has traveled more than 10 months and 442 million miles (711 million kilometers) to reach Mars for a first-of-its kind study of the planet's upper atmosphere.
The data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft aims to help scientists understand what happened to the water on Mars and the carbon dioxide in its atmosphere several billion years ago.
How Mars lost its atmosphere is one of science's biggest mysteries. The answers could shed light on the planet's potential to support life -- even if that was just microbial life -- long ago.
MAVEN's findings are also expected to help add to knowledge of how humans could survive on a future visit to the Red Planet, perhaps as early as 2030.
"Mars is a cool place, but there is not much atmosphere," said John Clarke, of the MAVEN science team.
"It is very cold, it is well below zero. The atmosphere is about half a per centof what we are breathing," he added.
"But we know that Mars could change and it was probably different in the past. There is a lot of evidence of flowing water on the surface from Mars's ancient history."
Next, MAVEN will enter a six-week phase for tests. Then, it begins a one-year mission of studying the gases in Mars's upper atmosphere and how it interacts with the sun and solar wind.
Much of MAVEN's year-long mission will be spent circling the planet 3,730 miles above the surface.
However, it will execute five deep dips to a distance of just 78 miles above the Martian landscape to get readings of the atmosphere at various levels.
NASA has sent several rovers and probes to Mars in recent years. The US space agency's latest robotic vehicle, Curiosity, is exploring Gale Crater and Mount Sharp, looking for interesting rocks and returning data on whether the Martian environment shows evidence of a past ability to support life.
Later this week, an Indian spacecraft, the Mars Orbiter Mission, will be on course to reach Mars.
The unmanned MOM probe is set to enter Mars's orbit in the next few years after 10 months in space, marking India's first mission to the planet to search for evidence of life.

Mangalyaan: Crucial wake-up call today  ahead of entry into Mars orbitComments
With  less than 48 hours left before the spacecraft enters Mars’ orbit, scientists of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) have successfully test-fired its liquid engine.
Before the test-firing, Annadurai, programme director at Isro, told Hindustan Times: “The test firing is like a trial. The dormant engine has to be brought back to life. It is a challenge but if one is prepared well for the exam, the confidence for success is higher.”
The nail-biting prelim was carried out at 2:30pm when the craft’s 440 Newton Liquid Apogee Motor engine, which has been idle for 300 days, was fired up for four seconds. The fourth and final trajectory corrections were also made.
“The engine will be fired for nearly 4 seconds and almost half a kg of fuel will be needed for this operation,” says Koteshwar Rao, scientific secretary, Isro before the test-firing
On September 24 it will be put in action along with eight thrusters to slow down Mangalyaan so it can be injected into a safe orbit around the Red Planet.
Isro launched the Mangalyaan on November 5 to find evidence of life on Mars. If the spacecraft makes it, India will be the fourth after US, Russia and Europe to reach the Red planet. Once in orbit, the craft’s five payloads will take pictures and collect data for the next six months.
Probes to Mars have a high failure rate. Of the 51 missions so far, only 21 have succeeded. A similar mission by China failed in 2011.

Renault EOLAB claims 100kmpl fuel economyPhotos
Renault EOLAB claims 1.0L/100km fuel economy
The Renault EOLAB concept, which will debut at the Paris motor show, is claimed to consume just 1 litre of petrol per 100km, equivalent to 22g of CO2/km. For Renault, the purpose of EOLAB is to remain true to the company’s DNA by ensuring that ultra-low fuel consumption becomes a reality for as many people as possible. Renault says EOLAB is much more than just a styling exercise or a mere shop window. Conceived around a B-segment platform, the prototype incorporates around 100 new, realistic technological developments that are designed to be introduced gradually on upcoming Renault vehicles. The EOLAB prototype’s exceptional fuel economy – namely 1 litre/100km – is the fruit of work on three main fronts: refined aerodynamics, weight saving and Z.E. Hybrid technology (petrol/electricity)

Gold  silver prices dip on poor demandGold prices dip on poor buying amid global bearishness
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 19, 2014  | 20:46 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
Gold continued its downward trend for the fourth-straight session at the domestic bullion market on Friday due to lack of demand from retail consumers amid uncertainty surrounding aftermath of the US Federal Reserve policy outcome .
Standard gold of 99.5 per cent purity fell by Rs 50 to conclude at Rs 26,525 per 10 grams compared to Thursday's Rs 26,575 .
Pure gold of 99.9 per cent purity also shed by a similar margin to settle at Rs 26,675 per 10 grams from Rs 26,725.
Similarly, silver also dropped sharply owing to consistent speculative unwinding coupled with lacklustre industrial demand.
Silver of .999 fineness slumped by Rs 190 to finish at Rs 41,320 per kg against Rs 41,510 yesterday.
On the global front, the precious metal plunged further sharply, touching its lowest level in nine months on the back of heavy funds unwinding following robust US macroeconomic data as well as falling jobless claims data amid a strong dollar.
The data came a day after the US Fed slashed its monthly bond-buying programme by another US $10 billion and kept interest rates near zero for a considerable time, dampening the metal's safe-haven appeal.
Spot gold was trading lower at US $1,222.80 an ounce in early European trade.

Talking trade and peace with ChinaUpdated: September 20, 2014 00:43 IST
Talking trade and peace with China
Srinath Raghavan
India-China
From India’s standpoint, attracting Chinese investment is imperative for reviving growth. Besides, its deepening ties with Japan, Australia and Vietnam have opened up more room for manoeuvre in Asia
Xi Jinping’s visit was billed as the third by a Chinese President. This may be right in a technical sense; not so from a historical perspective. Mr. Xi is actually the fourth Chinese President to visit India. The first was Chiang Kai-Shek, President of the Republic of China.
Read: Chinese President Xi Jinping in India
Chiang visited India in early 1942 — soon after Japan entered the Second World War. As the Tokyo typhoon swept Southeast Asia, India became vital for China’s survival. Chiang travelled to India seeking to persuade the Indian National Congress to fully support the British war effort. His long meetings with Nehru and with Gandhi did not yield much. And Chiang returned with little more than the spinning wheel that Gandhi had gifted to his wife.
India’s strategic role
Yet the visits by Presidents Chiang and Mr. Xi have more in common than the Gandhian spinning wheel. For one thing, they underscore India’s importance in any Asian security architecture. In the 1940s, when the hegemon in Asia — Britain — was knocked off its perch by a rising power, India played a pivotal strategic role in stopping Japan in its tracks. Today the situation is very different. Yet, as China’s swaggering rise rattles its neighbours, India is seen as a key player in ensuring a balanced regional order.
Further, both the visits point to the strategic quadrangle of China, Japan, India and the United States. In 1942, China sought American assistance in enabling India to hold Japan at bay. Now it is India and Japan that are working together against any unilateral Chinese attempt to rewrite the rules of the game in Asia. And the Americans are keenly backing their moves.
These wider considerations clearly underpin Mr. Xi’s desire to woo India. At any rate, his visit may turn out to be rather more successful than the maiden foray by Chiang. From China’s standpoint, India now appears an attractive destination for investment. Prime Minister Modi has given unprecedented political salience to infrastructure and industry. So, the Chinese are well placed to play to their strengths. From India’s standpoint, attracting Chinese investment is imperative for reviving growth. Besides, its deepening ties with Japan, Australia and Vietnam have opened up more room for manoeuvre in Asia.
In commerce, testing the waters
Yet, for a range of reasons, it may be prudent to temper expectations. First, China is not rushing to open its coffers to India. Prior to the visit, Chinese officials had claimed that Mr. Xi would commit to invest at least $100 billion. But the five-year plan inked by the two sides envisages $20 billion of Chinese investment. Clearly, Beijing is waiting to see if New Delhi can walk the talk. This is not surprising. Outside of Gujarat, China’s experience with big ticket investments has not been encouraging. This is precisely why the Prime Minister received Mr. Xi in Ahmedabad . Moreover, China — unlike Japan — does not have long experience of working in India.
Read: Key aspects of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India
Nevertheless, China’s inclination to test the waters implies that India’s trade deficit may not be adequately offset by capital inflows. To be sure, the Chinese have also agreed to improve market access for Indian firms. But it remains to be seen whether they will deliver on this. The economic imbalance between India and China, then, may not be set right anytime soon.
Second, Mr. Modi appears lukewarm to Mr. Xi’s ambitious plans for building multiple “ silk roads. ” Although India has finally agreed to consider the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) Corridor, it is unlikely to move with alacrity. India’s own backward linkages from the Northeast leave much to be desired. In such a situation, going ahead with a corridor — connecting the Northeast with these countries — will be seen as working mainly to China’s advantage. Nor does the proposed “maritime silk road” connecting China’s coastline with various hubs in the Indian Ocean have much traction in New Delhi.
Placing these proposals in the ice pail is not good idea, however. India must realise that these routes will come up irrespective of its participation. Countries across the region are drooling at the prospect of big infrastructure and cheap Chinese finance. Sri Lanka and the Maldives have lapped up Mr. Xi’s plans for a “maritime silk road.” India, too, could benefit much from joining these ventures. For instance, the upgradation of our coastal infrastructure would considerably aid our emergence as a serious maritime — not just naval — power. Concerns about Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean can be overdone. In the past three years, New Delhi has put in place practical arrangements for maritime security with Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Seychelles and Mauritius.
Border ‘incursions’ and claims
Finally, there is the disputed boundary which cast a shadow on the summit. The Prime Minister rightly observed that peace and stability along the borders was crucial to realising the enormous economic potential of Sino-Indian relations. But his call for the resumption of talks on clarifying the Line of Actual Control (LAC) was off-beam. This can hardly help prevent “incursions”.
The LAC is supposed to divide the areas that are under Indian and Chinese control since the end of the 1962 war. The line, however, was not mutually agreed upon by the two sides. This was because the war ended with a unilateral ceasefire and the subsequent withdrawal by China. In the Ladakh sector, the question of where exactly Chinese forces stood after the war remains contested. The areas where Chinese “incursions” occur are claimed by both sides as lying on their side of the LAC. In the Arunachal Pradesh sector, the Chinese treat the McMahon Line as the LAC. But they challenge India’s claim that the Line should follow the watershed or the highest line of mountains. They point out that the coordinates of the McMahon Line — as set out in the Simla Conference of 1914 — depart at places from the watershed. These “grey areas” south of the watershed are the places where Chinese “incursions” occur in this sector.
Given these differing notions of the LAC, any exercise in clarification is unlikely to succeed. We can only agree to disagree. The good thing is that we know the areas of disagreement. What’s more, both sides will continue to intrude into these areas. At one level, this is tactical jockeying. Chumar, for instance, is the only place along the LAC in Ladakh which the Chinese cannot directly access. Hence, the spurt in Chinese probing near Chumar. Demchok is one of two “mutually agreed disputed areas,” but that does not stop India from going ahead with its activities. At another level, “incursions” are essential for both sides to keep alive their territorial claims.
Towards settlement
Indeed, the only way to put an end to “incursions ” is to settle the boundary dispute. It is worth recalling that under Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee, India had initially insisted on talks to clarify the LAC. By 2003, however, the government came round to the sensible view that these would not help and that it was essential to kick-start negotiations on the boundary by appointing special representatives. The subsequent agreement of 2005 provides an ideal basis for settlement by mutual concessions. It acknowledges India’s concerns over places like Tawang by tacitly agreeing that settled areas are not up for bargaining. It takes China’s demands into account by suggesting that the watershed principle may not be ironclad.
All along, a settlement has proved elusive owing to political concerns. Governments in both India and China have baulked at the prospect of selling a deal to their domestic audiences. Having insistently laid claims to Arunachal Pradesh, Beijing is concerned about dropping them for good. Indian governments, for their part, have paled at the thought of pushing through a constitutional amendment — one that will require two-thirds majority in both Houses as well as ratification by 50 per cent of the State legislatures. The problem is not just of numbers. Even governments with commanding majorities such as those led by Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi have hesitated to grasp the nettle — owing mainly to opposition from within their own party and concerns about adverse political fall out.
In the run-up to the summit, Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi were projected as powerful and decisive leaders. As such, they should be ideally placed to take a serious crack at resolving the boundary dispute. Mr. Modi is supposedly free of the baggage that weighed on the Congress party. He is certainly capable of making a persuasive public case for a settlement. Instead of going down the rabbit-hole of LAC clarification, the government should move boldly to settle the boundary dispute with China.

Yahoo rakes in another jackpot from Alibaba IPOYahoo rakes in another jackpot from Alibaba IPO

Yahoo is making amends for years of blundering with one smart move: an early investment in China's Alibaba Group that has turned into a multibillion-dollar boon.
The latest windfall will be delivered with Alibaba's record-setting IPO completed late on Friday, which is expected raise up to $25 billion for the e-commerce company and its early backers.
Alibaba's shares began trading for the first time on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Yahoo is in line to make anywhere from $8.3 billion to $9.5 billion from the initial public offering, depending on whether investment bankers exercise their right to buy additional stock in the deal.
The payoff supplements the $7.6 billion jackpot that Yahoo collected two years ago after selling another chunk of its Alibaba holdings and reworked a licensing agreement with the Chinese company.
Even if Yahoo ends up selling its maximum allotment of 140 million shares in the IPO, the Sunnyvale, California, company will still retain a roughly 16 percent stake in Alibaba Group Ltd.
Not a bad return, considering Yahoo acquired its Alibaba stake for $1 billion in 2005 in a deal engineered by company co-founder Jerry Yang and former CEO Terry Semel.
The Alibaba investment has helped ease the pain of Yahoo's struggles in Internet advertising, the heart of its business. Yahoo's annual revenue has slipped from a peak of $7.2 billion to projected $4.5 billion this year, a decline of nearly 40 per cent.

World united in fight against ISIL: Barack ObamaPress Trust of India | Washington | Posted: September 20, 2014 4:04 pm
As he continues to galvanise the world for a broad coalition against the Islamic State , US President Barack Obama on Saturday said the international community is united in its fight against the dreaded terror group, which has gained control over large parts of Syria and Iraq.
“This is not America’s fight alone. I won’t commit our troops to fighting another ground war in Iraq, or in Syria.  It’s more effective to use our capabilities to help partners on the ground secure their own country’s futures,” Obama said in his weekly address to the nation.
He said, “We will use our air power. We will train and equip our partners. We will advise and we will assist.”
Over 40 countries have offered to help the broad campaign against the Islamic State or ISIL so far – from training and equipment, to humanitarian relief, to flying combat missions.
“We will lead a broad coalition of nations who have a stake in this fight. This isn’t America vs ISIL. This is the people of that region vs ISIL. It’s the world vs ISIL,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for the group.
“This week, at the United Nations, I’ll continue to rally the world against this threat,” he added.
Obama is scheduled to address the annual session of the UN General Assembly in New York next week.
Over the past week, the US has continued to lead its friends and allies in the strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL, he said.
“As I’ve said before, our intelligence community has not yet detected specific plots from these terrorists against America. But its leaders have threatened America and our allies. And if left unchecked, they could pose a growing threat to the United States,” Obama said.
“So, last month, I gave the order for our military to begin taking targeted action against ISIL. Since then, American pilots have flown more than 170 airstrikes against these terrorists in Iraq. France has now joined us in these airstrikes,” he said.
Obama said the US will not hesitate to take action against these terrorists in Iraq or in Syria.
In his address, Obama also thanked the Congress for approving his request to train and arm Syrian rebels.
“A majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans in both the House and the Senate have now approved a first, key part of our strategy by wide margins. They’ve given our troops the authority they need to train Syrian opposition fighters so that they can fight ISIL in Syria,” he said.
This week, at the United Nations, I'll continue to rally the world against this threat, said Barack Obama.

Uddhavs final offer: 151 for Sena  119 for BJPShiv Sena party president Uddhav Thackeray at the party workers meeting in Mumbai on September 21, 2014. Photo: Vivek Bendre
Mumbai, Sept 21:  
Shiv Sena today made it clear that it won’t make any more concession for BJP, offering to cede it only 119 out of the total 288 seats in Maharashtra Assembly for the next month’s polls, and said this was “the final attempt” to break the logjam over seat-sharing.
Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also reminded Prime Minister Narendra Modi that late Sena supremo Bal Thackeray had backed him in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots.
“Today I am making a final attempt to ensure that the Mahayuti (grand alliance of opposition parties) stays intact.
Sena had initially asked for 160 seats. But now we are ready to part with nine seats. Shiv Sena will fight on 151 seats, leaving 119 seats for BJP. The remaining 18 seats will be given to our allies,” he said.
“I cannot go any further,” said Thackeray, who addressed his party workers this morning after a meeting of the party’s state executive.
“Maharashtra will be the number one state in the country if Sena comes to power. I want power and I will take it at any cost. But this power is to give Maharashtra something and not to take away, like other parties do,” he said.
“Everyone knows how terrible the situation was when the Godhra riots took place. Everyone was saying that Modi should be immediately removed from the Gujarat CM’s post. At that time, it was only Balasaheb who told LK Advani that Modi should stay on as he pursues the Hindutva ideology,” he said.
Thackeray said that state BJP chief Devendra Fadanvis met him last night and proposed that Sena should contest 140 seats while BJP should get 130 (the rest going to smaller allies of Mahayuti). However, he couldn’t accept this as it would frustrate the aspirations of many Sena candidates, he said.
Reacting to senior state BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar’s allegation that the Sena did not support BJP in the last two Presidential elections, Thackeray said he was “proud” of the decisions then.
“BJP said we did not support them during the Presidential election by backing Pratibha Patil. But we backed her as she would be the first President from Maharashtra. We also backed Pranab Mukherjee as PA Sangma was not from NDA. He was originally an NCP leader,” he said.
It is now Shiv Sena's turn
Just as Sena did not play a spoilsport in BJP’s “Mission 272’ in the Lok Sabha polls, BJP should now respect Sena’s 'Mission 150’ for the Maharashtra polls, he said.
“There are Shiv Sena workers in UP, Rajasthan and MP as well. They all wanted to fight elections saying they have been with Sena for long and thus deserve a chance. But we didn’t let them contest (against BJP/NDA candidates). Now it is Shiv Sena’s turn. It is our mission to send at least 150 MLAs to the Vidhan Sabha. BJP should consider this,” he said.
“I feel from the bottom of my heart that the alliance should stay as this alliance is not for the Chief Minister’s post but for Hindutva. But whatever happens will be my destiny. We are ready to contest all the seats,” the Sena chief said.

Dalits dragged by horses  hit with pistol butt in Bihars wild westComments
Three persons, including two Dalit workers of the ruling Janata Dal (United), were allegedly tied to horses and dragged for quite a distance before being tied to a pole and hit with a pistol butt and sticks, over a political dispute.
The gruesome incident took place near Khairpur village under Kharik police station in Naugacchia police district in south eastern Bihar, late afternoon on Saturday.
The victims – identified as Kharik block JD (U) dalit cell chief Bablu Das, his dalit associate Niraj Das and party worker Kapildev Mandal, were rushed to the Kharik primary health centre in a fairly serious condition.
“Bablu Das has a fracture in his arm while Mandal has a badly swollen face from the beating,” said JD (U) local (Gopalpur) MLA Narendra Kumar Neeraj alias Gopal Mandal, who informed the police about the incident.
Official sources said the main assailant had been identified as Ajay Yadav, a man known for his strong arm ways and stated to be a close relation of a local mukhia, Vimla Devi.
Sources said late Saturday, Yadav fired at the three men in the Naugacchia riverene area, known for high incidence of criminal activity, as they headed for their native Khairpur on a motorcycle.

When they fell down from the motorbike, Yadav and his associates allegedly tied Bablu and Niraj behind a horse with a rope and Mandal to another horse. Then, the three were allegedly dragged to Vimla Devi’s residence.
There, they were tied to a pole and hit repeatedly with a pistol butt, said sources privy to the incident.
Reached for his comment Sunday afternoon, Naugacchia SP Shekhar Kumar confirmed the incident. “The main accused, Ajay Yadav, has already been arrested and sent to jail,” he said.
The SP described the incident as a “clash” and said it was the outcome of a political dispute between the mukhia, Vimla Devi, and a local municipal ward member with whom the three injured persons were associated.
“While the injured persons had instituted an SC-ST act case against Yadav and his associates, the other side had lodged an arms act case against the JD (U) activists, alleging they were carrying illegal arms,” the SP told HT.
He denied that the injured persons had been tied behind horses and dragged on the ground for any distance.
However, JD (U) MLA Neeraj, who is also a whip of the ruling party in the Bihar assembly, insisted there was absolutely no doubt that that the victims were dragged after being tied behind horses.
“The Ganga diara (riverine area) of Naugacchia is the wild west of Bihar, where it is common for horse riding criminals to enforce their diktats in the most inhuman fashion,” he said.
Neeraj said while a political dispute may have been one of the causes behind the incident, it could not have been the sole one.
“Earlier, too, the accused had done similar, unspeakable things to terrorise the weaker sections of the society,” he claimed.

No plans to tie-up with pvt cos for retail expansion: BPCL
Rival Hindustan Petroleum, which is the second largest OMC player, recently said it would be keen to tie up with private players like RIL or Essar for sharing their idle retail infrastructure.

Country's third largest oil marketeer Bharat Petroleum Corporation ( BPCL ) has ruled out tying up with private players, saying the PSU has enough capabilities for expanding its retail presence on its own.
Rival Hindustan Petroleum, which is the second largest OMC player, recently said it would be keen to tie up with private players like RIL or Essar for sharing their idle retail infrastructure.
"We have no plans to engage with private players to share their retail infrastructure for marketing as we are hopeful of taking on competition on our own. We don't see any brand synergy in doing so and also we have enough capabilities to invest more in retail expansion," BPCL chairman and managing director S Varadarajan told reporters here over the weekend after the AGM.
The chairman said BPCL had opened more than 900 outlets last fiscal, taking the company's total retail network to over 12,500, the company will open more outlets, but did not specify a number.
It can be noted that private players like Reliance and Essar Oil with thousands of outlets have shut down marketing following the government refusal to free diesel prices after the 2006 oil spike. But with diesel being sold at market price now, they are likely to re-enter marketing now.
HPCL chairman and managing director Nishi Vasudeva had earlier this month said her company would like to tie-up with private players for convenience and to save on capital expenditure, but added nothing had been finalised yet.
Currently, oil firms are selling diesel at 35 paise above market rate as the government has not allowed them officially to cut prices. There have been reports that it may formally announce diesel deregulation post-October 15 assembly elections. .
BPCL stock price
On November 21, 2014, Bharat Petroleum Corporation closed at Rs 723.80, up Rs 5.15, or 0.72 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 777.15 and the 52-week low was Rs 315.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 64.44 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 11.23. The latest book value of the company is Rs 269.11 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 2.69.

Surge in stocks with low returns on equity: Tread with cautionSurge in stocks with low returns on equity: Tread with caution
Sheetal Aggarwal | Mumbai Sep 22, 2014 12:15 AM IST
The S&P BSE Sensex has risen 28 per cent in 2014 so far. A stable and reforms-oriented government at the Centre, heightened expectations of economic pick-up, a rise in cement demand and automobile volumes and strong foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows are some reasons for the rally.
Interestingly, stocks with low (below 15 per cent) returns on equity (RoE) have also seen a sharp rally, giving returns of up to 440 per cent. In the BSE 500 universe, 61 stocks have risen by 100 per cent and above on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. Of these, about 40 companies had below 15 per cent returns and of these, 26 companies had below 10 per cent RoEs, show their latest annual financial results. Return on equity or net worth (RoE or RoNW) is the net profit of a company divided by the shareholders' funds, and reflects the rate of return earned on the latter. Experts say the cut-off of 15 per cent RoE is reasonable, as banks charge borrowers an interest rate of 11-12 per cent, and companies should be able to earn reasonably more than the lending rate.
Among companies that have gained the most on the bourses are CCL International, Mahindra CIE, JK Lakshmi, HCL Info, Gati and HSIL, SRF and Amtek Auto. While the gains in some of these stocks are backed by fundamental reasons, others have raced much ahead of their fundamentals, experts believe. Thus, a deeper look at this trend and the prospects of these companies can provide interesting investment ideas, as well as profit-booking ones.
Cyclicality could be a key driver of the rally in some of these stocks. Gaurav Dua, head of research, Sharekhan, says: "Quite a few of these companies have shown healthy RoEs of 20-plus per cent in better times. Therefore, a large part of the rally is built on the expectation of an economic revival-driven improvement in demand, leading to a boost in earnings consequently in RoE in the coming years." He adds that weaker companies facing structural issues have also witnessed an unwarranted run-up, and might see some correction.
So, how does one assess these stocks? One strong indicator of prospects are the earnings. From Bloomberg data, companies such as BEML, Motilal Oswal Securities (MOSL) and Shashun Pharma are likely to deliver a compound annual growth rate in earnings (CAGR) of over 100 per cent over FY14-16. BEML is seen as benefiting from a macroeconomic recovery and revival in the defence, railways and construction sectors. MOSL should gain from a boom in capital markets. But, in the case of BEML and Sadbhav Engineering, the price to earnings (PE) valuation of 50 times and 34 times, respectively, based on FY16 earnings estimates, are much higher than those of the broader markets, suggesting these are already factoring into medium-term gains. Based on estimated FY16 earnings (Bloomberg), while the Sensex PE is 14.5, that of the S&P BSE Mid-Cap index is about 14. Many of these companies fall in the mid-cap category.
Among other companies, the Street is factoring in a 322 per cent compound annual growth in earnings per share (EPS) during FY14-16 for Ashok Leyland, which is quoting at an FY16 PE of 20 times. Dalmia Bharat and Prism Cement are likely to report a turnaround, with a net profit from FY15 onwards as against a loss in FY14, on the back of improving cement demand. The PE for all these is around 16, indicating fair valuation for now. Others such as Mahindra CIE could gain from revival in automobile demand. These companies will benefit from macroeconomic growth picking up and easier fund raising via the debt and equity markets. Consequently, experts believe, the RoE could improve materially for some of these companies. And, valuations are not significantly high.
Premal Madhavji, head of Equities at Espirito Santo Securities, says: "Among the low historical RoE stocks that have delivered huge YTD returns, we believe Mahindra CIE Auto, Prism Cements, MOSL, JK Cements and Ceat could deliver higher earnings and RoE this year, so the outperformance might be justified, while the rally in some others could fizzle out."
Dua adds: "We see value in JK Lakshmi, Amtek Auto, HSIL and SRF, where there is a scope for decent growth in earnings (20-25 per cent CAGR) over the next three years, with improvement in RoEs."
Among stocks likely to lag on earnings growth are Bharat Electronics (10 per cent EPS compounded annual growth over FY14-16), Cox and Kings (-0.4 per cent), Sintex (11.1 per cent) and Tata Sponge (13.6 per cent). Part of this is reflecting in valuations that are lower than those of the broader markets. Stocks such as CCL International, Gati, Advanta and Asahi have also rallied significantly but do not have Bloomberg earnings estimates as these are not tracked by a majority of analysts.
Similarly with stocks such as Advanta, PS IT Infra, MTNL, Asahi Glass, HCC and Timken India, besides Risa International (up 99 per cent YTD). The risk with some of these counters is that they are thinly traded on the exchanges, Risa International being an example. Likewise, PS IT Infra is one counter that has been locked in the upper circuit (only buyers) for most days - the few days it wasn't - the stock saw only sellers.
In MTNL's case, too, the fundamentals are far from exciting, and the stock is largely up on the buzz of a possible merger with BSNL. Investors should, thus, be cautious with such stocks.

India  US work on WTO deal ahead of Modi-Obama meetComments
India and the US are working on a compromise formula on food subsidies to remove a major irritant in the stalled World Trade Organization (WTO) deal ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with President Barack Obama in Washington later this month.
Logo of the World Trade Organization (WTO), that deals with the global rules of trade between nations.
Top government sources told HT that India and US were working to revise the terms of the so-called trade facilitation agreement (TFA) for easier, faster and cheaper trade by making systems transparent and cutting red tape ahead of the Modi-Obama summit.
Once the two sides agree on broad contours, it should pave the way for a new agreement at the WTO.
This and many more big tickets announcements are expected when Modi visits the White House on September 29-30 after meeting other world leaders on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York.
Read: US nudge on WTO position continues
India has made it clear that state-funded welfare schemes for the poor were non-negotiable even taking the blame for blocking the TFA in July as it did not come bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies.
The TFA would have hit India’s food security programme and food grain procurement through the minimum support prices (MSP).
As part of a revised proposal, India and the US are learnt to be discussing the finer nuances of an indefinite “peace clause” on food security until a permanent solution is found, the sources said.
A “peace clause” gives legal security to member countries and protects them from being challenged under other WTO agreements.
Developed nations have shown support for a “peace clause” that would agree to developing countries’ demands on food security for a period of four years.
India, however, is pushing for a guarantee for further exemption until a permanent solution is negotiated and a way found to allow countries the right to provide higher subsidies to their poor beyond these four years.
When US secretary of state John Kerry visited India in July, the PM conveyed to Washington that the WTO deadlock should not come in the way of a much larger relationship, officials said.
 Besides, sources said, Obama was keen on a “productive summit” with Modi, with the White House also pushing hard for the thorny WTO issue to be sorted out before the two leaders meet.
In July, India withstood mounting pressure from the developed countries, including the US, which had blamed New Delhi’s “rigid stand” for the collapse of the talks, putting the WTO’s future in “uncertain ground.”
India is of the view that without a permanent solution, its food subsidies and public stockholding programmes such as buffer stocks will be hampered.

Existing rules cap the value of food subsidies at 10% of the value of production. But, the subsidy is calculated against three-decade-old prices which have since risen many fold. It means that many countries will find it difficult to stay within the WTO limits, potentially attracting strong penalties.

Mars mission: Ahead of D-day  a wake-up callComments
With  less than 48 hours left before the spacecraft enters Mars’ orbit, scientists of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) have successfully test-fired its liquid engine.
Before the test-firing, Annadurai, programme director at Isro, told Hindustan Times: “The test firing is like a trial. The dormant engine has to be brought back to life. It is a challenge but if one is prepared well for the exam, the confidence for success is higher.”
The nail-biting prelim was carried out at 2:30pm when the craft’s 440 Newton Liquid Apogee Motor engine, which has been idle for 300 days, was fired up for four seconds. The fourth and final trajectory corrections were also made.
“The engine will be fired for nearly 4 seconds and almost half a kg of fuel will be needed for this operation,” says Koteshwar Rao, scientific secretary, Isro before the test-firing
On September 24 it will be put in action along with eight thrusters to slow down Mangalyaan so it can be injected into a safe orbit around the Red Planet.
Isro launched the Mangalyaan on November 5 to find evidence of life on Mars. If the spacecraft makes it, India will be the fourth after US, Russia and Europe to reach the Red planet. Once in orbit, the craft’s five payloads will take pictures and collect data for the next six months.
Probes to Mars have a high failure rate. Of the 51 missions so far, only 21 have succeeded. A similar mission by China failed in 2011.

Situation along LAC tense but under controlSituation along LAC tense but under control

The situation along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh remained tense but under control, a government official said on Sunday.
The military standoff involving India and China in Chumar area entered its 11th day, with soldiers from both armies refusing to back off from the positions held by them. More than 1,000 Indian and Chinese soldiers are involved in the border faceoff.
The soldiers have pitched tents at their respective locations to beat sub-zero temperatures.
“The temperature along the LAC is not rising but both armies are staying put. We are working through diplomatic channels to end the stalemate,” he said.
Two flag meetings between Indian and Chinese commanders last week failed to end the border impasse. The Indian Army, which is prepared for a long haul, is in no mood to make a third attempt anytime soon to defuse the crisis.
Chumar has been a flashpoint in the border feud with China, with the neighbouring army frequently violating the LAC despite New Delhi and Beijing inking a new pact in October last year to ensure peace and stability along the disputed border.
Indian and Chinese civilians have also locked horns at Charding-Ninglung Nullah track junction in Demchok, further east of Chumar.

Spirit Airlines goes yellow  raises bag fees for holiday travelSpirit Airlines goes yellow, raises bag fees for holiday travel
Ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines is changing its colors — but not its stripes.
Following the lead of Southwest and Frontier airlines, Florida-based Spirit announced a new, very yellow livery for its fleet of 61 planes.
------------
FOR THE RECORD
Sept. 22, 9:57 a.m.: An earlier version of this post stated that Spirit Airlines has a fleet of 35 planes. It has 61 planes.
------------
Passenger fees and other extra charges generated $27.1 billion for airlines around the world in 2012, with major carriers like United, Delta and American airlines leading the revenue race. ( Hugo Martín )
With less fanfare, the ultra low-fare carrier known for imposing a long menu of passenger fees recently notified passengers that it is raising bag fees by $2 for flights during the upcoming holidays. The higher fees are for flights booked after Aug. 19 for trips between Dec. 18 and Jan. 5.
The airline explained on its website that the fee hike is intended to “encourage customers to pack a bit lighter” to make room for more bags during the crowded holiday season.

As for the new livery, Spirit is painting seven of its planes bright yellow with black lettering, with the rest of the fleet getting painted as planes are replaced or undergo regular repainting. The entire fleet should be painted within three years.
The new livery announcement comes after Dallas-based Southwest Airlines and Denver-based Frontier Airlines unveiled their new exterior designs. Southwest will keep the familiar blue, gold and red colors but will move the name of the airline from the tail to the fuselage. Frontier will add green lettering but retain its trademark animal portraits on the tail.

Need more transparency and expediency in productapproval"Surrenders have been a concern area for the industry. People have been coming and saying that they want their money back even though the value was low".
Written by Sandeep Singh | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 3:55 am
The rise in equity markets and investor sentiments may have benefited the insurance sector but the industry still has not witnessed clear signs of growth coming back. While the industry has been under stress for the last four years, Rajesh Sud, CEO & MD of Max Life Insurance, told Sandeep Singh that time taken on product approval still remains at elevated levels and the responsibility lies with both the product manufacturers and the regulator. Excerpts:
It seems the industry is lagging in action. What is holding the sector from coming out of the downturn?
It is tougher as of now and that’s a fact and reality. While part of it is a result of economic slowdown, partly it is a result of change in products and regulation. I think a lot has happened and some new things have been tried such as around insurance marketing firms, focus on common service centre (CSC) pilots, multiple meetings have happened and products have been defined to leverage the CSC network and also get the financial inclusion agenda progressing.
There is a focus on e-depositories. While several things have been done, have they translated in growth, the answer would be, no. The industry has shrunk by 3 per cent. All these steps would come good in the long run but till then there will be a phase of transition that the industry will go through.
What do you think is needed from the government and regulator that may set things rolling?
The big thing that will push things forward is the Insurance Amendment Bill which will bring in a lot of structural changes and give rule making powers to the regulator. At IRDA’s level there are few things that the industry is in dialogue — one is to look at the product approval process and see how there can be more transparency and expediency.
Both the regulator and the industry have to work together on this. There is a feeling that the industry can be a little bit more deliberate on the number of products filed, how are they different from each other and on adhering to the spirit of regulation.
Almost two years back, the finance ministry had done an exercise asking IRDA, the average time taken to approve products and it stood at around 344 days for health and 105 days for life. How is it now?
Going by our experience, I would think that the time taken is still around that. There is a need to improve turnaround time but it is a shared responsibility where the industry has to also file smarter and more accurate versions of the product and the regulatory process has continued…

Can any Indian firm replicate success of Ali...Alibaba
(While India ticks all the…)
NEW DELHI/BANGALORE: When an online commerce company set up by a former English teacher in China makes a stunning debut on the US bourses, questions are bound to arise as to whether an Indian player can replicate the success.
While success in entrepreneurship is largely due to individual brilliance — as is evident from Alibaba's and its founder Jack Ma's spectacular IPO last week — other factors, including investment climate and government regulations, do play a key part.
Hangzhou, China-based Alibaba's shares soared almost 40% in its first day of trading on New York Stock Exchange as investors fought over a piece of what is expected to be the largest IPO in history
While India ticks all the right boxes when it comes to demand and potential for growth, the jury is out if an Indian ecommerce player would be able to do what Alibaba did within the next few years.
Industry pundits point out that India's ecommerce sector is at a stage where China was in 2007, but a combination of factors — such as low Internet penetration, supply chain and logistics hurdles and an archaic regulatory regime — act as barriers. "One cannot have this scale if you don't think of going global.
I don't see any company in India working toward that right now," said Rachna Nath, leader of retail and consumer at PricewaterhouseCoopers India. "That is the need of the hour."
 
According to a recent report by investment bank Avendus Capital, India's online commerce sector, currently valued at $3.1 billion (Rs 18,800 crore), is expected to gross about $5 billion (Rs 30,500 crore) by end of the current year, and is projected to hit over $11.8 billion (Rs 71,800 crore) in sales by end of 2015.
Impressive, but still tiny compared with the $542 billion (Rs 33 lakh crore) that China's ecommerce, which contributes more than 3% to the country's GDP, is expected to touch by 2015. "It's unfair to expect that we will produce a company the size of Alibaba right away, given the difference in basic denominators, such as GDP and retail market size of the two countries," said Kunal Bahl, co-founder and chief executive of Snapdeal.
According to Bahl, the strategy is to build an ecommerce company for the Indian market, and not to ape existing business models. "If you went to China in 2007-08, you would be asking the same questions of them, as you're asking about India's ecommerce sector now," said Bahl.
"It's not common to see billion- dollar businesses growing 300- 400% year-on-year. It's an unusual thing. I don't think there's any other industry in India growing at that kind of pace."
Regulatory roadblocks, however, continue to be a cause for concern, with Amazon India's recent tax issues with the Karnataka government highlighting the dissonance between prevailing tax norms and the demands of growth.
"The Centre needs to address a whole gamut of tax-related issues for retail industry, not just ecommerce. Otherwise, the ecommerce firms will be at the mercy of local tax officials in different states," said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail advisory firm Technopak.
High cost of customer acquisition incurred by India's ecommerce companies, adding to already-significant burn rates, is also a cause for concern. The average aggregate cost of acquiring users is estimated at between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.
"Establishing 'stickiness' is going to be an issue. There will always be margin pressure to keep prices low, given that customers tend to switch easily," said Ajay Relan, founder and managing partner of private equity firm CX Partners.
On a per-dollar basis, private equity investors earn more from their investments in China than in India.
Barriers notwithstanding, bigger ecommerce ventures in the country such as Bangalore-based Flipkart and Delhi-based Snapdeal, are building up technology platforms investing in infrastructure. "Reach is still limited. What is really desirable is the ability to deliver, manage logistics," said PwC's Nath.
In May, Snapdeal launched 40 fulfilment centres or warehouses across 15 cities, and said it plans on launching more over the next few months. Rival Flipkart runs about six such warehouses.
Both companies have crossed gross merchandise value (GMV), or value of goods sold on their website, of $1 billion (Rs 6,000 crore) in the past few months. This, however, pales in comparison to Alibaba, which reported GMV of $248 billion (Rs 15 lakh crore) for the previous fiscal, according to its draft red herring prospectus.
With the desktop revolution bypassing India, Snapdeal and Flipkart, along with their peers, are focusing on the mobile platform to drive deeper penetration in the country. India currently has a mobile subscriber base of over 900 million, one of the largest in the world.
"3G prices have been coming down and the growth of smartphones makes it very clear there will be a tsunami of new users going forward," pointed out Bahl.
Both Flipkart and Snapdeal see more than 50% of their overall orders coming from mobile. It's a strategy that has been accepted by global private equity and strategic investors, as they continue to pour money into the space. While Flipkart raised a massive $1 billion in financing in July, Snapdeal is also believed to have closed its latest funding round led by Alibaba and Japanese investor SoftBank.
Amazon chief Jeff Bezos has also committed $2 billion (Rs 12,000 crore) towards the e-tailer's Indian unit. "For Amazon, due to regulations in China, India is the only emerging market still open and it will never let go of that opportunity," said Rahul Khanna, MD at Canaan Partners, which has companies such as Naaptol and BharatMatrimony in its portfolio. "An Alibaba or not, we will see at least $5 billion companies from India in next 10 years."

Infosys transformation may take 2 years: Analysts | Co gets its magic backChief Executive Officer and Managing Director
(With Vishal Sikka at…)
BANGALORE: Infosys' two-year transformational process may take at least another two years as the company aims to scale itself to offer high-value services, according to experts who got a chance to interact for the first time with Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Vishal Sikka at an event in Berlin last week.
Even so, analysts who were at the customer event believe that if successful, the country's secondlargest software exporter could see improved margins with a new approach of trying to balance "to-do-same-for-less" contracts with "co-innovate-withthe-customer" type of deals. "Vishal presented a plan to reposition Infosys as a co-innovator for new business logic jointly with the customers," said Stefan Ried, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research .
"Some is packaged in Edge application (products, platforms and solutions or EdgeVerve) or Finacle (core banking product), others are less packaged and customer-specific," said Ried. "Infosys is in a transformational process since the last two years, which may take another two to three years."
The company "will take probably couple of years to be where" it aims to be, Infosys Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao said at a CLSA conference on September 15.
"Today, when we look at our business, a big part of our business is getting commoditised," said Rao, adding that customers don't see much difference between offerings of leading IT outsourcers.
"So one of the areas we are looking at is how to start looking at some of the delivery service offerings, how to bring in element of differentiation, how to introduce automation and how to be more productive so that we can be more competitive," he said.
For the past few years, Infosys has been lagging behind some of its peers, including the country's leading IT firm, Tata Consultancy Services. When founder NR Narayana Murthy was asked to return to steer the company last June, he outlined a three-pronged strategy to help Infosys.
With Sikka at the helm now, the company is seeking to "transform" itself to be able to deliver innovative solutions. Sikka was a member of the Executive Board of SAP AG before joining Infosys in August.
"Somebody who is just outsourcing infrastructure could ybe replaced after the contract is expired but somebody who helps you architect your company's business logic stay for decades, just like SAP does," said Ried. To offer such solutions, Sikka is looking at ways to reduce costs and help free up budgets for innovation, according to Philip Carnelley, research director, European Software Group at IDC .

Nifty seen opening lower; may retest 8100 levelsSave precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open lower on Monday following muted trend seen in other Asian markets. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to retest its crucial psychological level of 8100 in trade today.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 54 points higher at 8070 indicating negative opening on the domestic market.
The 50-share Nifty index staged a smart rally towards the end of the week to record sixth straight week of rise. However, US Fed uncertainty capped gains and both Sensex and Nifty registered marginal gains for the week ended September 19.
Nifty moved past the resistance of 8130 in intraday trade but was unable to close above it. Initial support for the index is placed at 8030.
If Nifty manages to stay above 8030 and clears the resistance of 8130 then there is a possibility of a retest of 8180 and possibly 8229, GEPL Capital said in a report.
"But a move below 8030 can bring it down till 8000 and lower. An important support for short term is now placed at 7920; however, the medium term support and trend reversal level remains at 7820 for Nifty," added the report.
On Friday, US stocks closed flat after Alibaba's strong debut was offset by falling technology shares as Oracle and Yahoo stumbled, but the Dow managed to edge higher to set a record for a second straight session.
"Alibaba took the spotlight after its initial public offering priced at $68 a share and rose as high as $99.70 before ending the session up 38 percent to $93.89, Reuters reported.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 13.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to 17,279.74, the S&P 500 lost 0.96 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,010.40, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 13.64 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 4,579.79.
Asian shares were trading lower. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was trading 0.74 per cent lower at 16,247 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 1.05 per cent lower at 24,040.
South Korea's Kospi index was trading 0.67 per cent lower at 2,040 and China's Shanghai index was trading 0.74 per cent lower at 2,312.

Asian Shares Slip, Dollar Pulls Away From Highs
Reuters | Updated On: September 22, 2014 08:05 (IST)
The Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
Tokyo: Asian shares skidded on Monday as investors awaited data this week that could provide more evidence of a slowdown in China, while the dollar gave back a little of its recent gains.
China's flash manufacturing PMI reading on Tuesday could come in below the 50 level, indicating that manufacturing activity is contracting.
"The psychological effect of a below-50 reading will be significant and consistent with the slew of softer Chinese data over recent weeks." Mitul Kotecha, head of FX strategy Asia-Pacific for Barclays in Singapore, said in a note to clients.
China will not dramatically alter its economic policy because of any one economic indicator, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said on Sunday, in remarks at a meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the Group of 20 nations who met in the Australian city of Cairns. His remarks came days after many economists lowered growth forecasts having seen the latest set of weak data.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.8 per cent. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.7 per cent, after it marked its highest closing level since 2007 on Friday, and gained 2.3 per cent for the week.
Alibaba Group, in one of the biggest IPOs ever, ended up 38 per cent at $93.89 on massive volume on Friday. Because the Chinese online retailer's stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is not an S&P 500 component, its gains were not reflected in major indexes and it did little to help an otherwise lacklustre day on Wall Street.
The G20 leaders said they were close to adding an extra $2 trillion to the global economy and creating millions of new jobs, but Europe's extended stagnation remained a major stumbling block.
The dollar gave up 0.2 per cent against a basket of major currencies to 84.600, after the index posted its 10th consecutive week of gains on expectations that US interest rates would rise more quickly than had been expected.
The Federal Reserve should start raising US interest rates in the spring, earlier than many investors currently expect, and should do so both slowly and gradually, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said in an interview on Fox Business Network on Friday.
But the outlook for US monetary policy remains murky. The Fed issued a policy statement at the close of last week's two-day meeting that suggested the first rate hike wasn't due until around the middle of next year.
The greenback eased about 0.2 per cent against its Japanese counterpart to 108.85 yen, moving away from a six-year high of 109.46 yen scaled on Friday.
The euro edged up 0.2 per cent on the day to $1.2854, after earlier drifting down to touch a fresh 14-month low against the dollar of $1.2826.
Sterling added 0.4 per cent to $1.6351 after it soared on Friday following Scotland's vote to reject independence.
Spot gold shed 0.2 per cent to $1,212.56. Last week, gold posted a 1 per cent drop for its third consecutive weekly fall.
Brent crude dropped 0.5 per cent to $97.91 a barrel, while US crude for October delivery, which expires later on Monday, fell about 0.3 per cent to $92.13.

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol Thirumavalavan on Sunday demanded that a Lokayukta be constituted in Tamil Nadu to curb corruption.
He was here to take part in the 136th birth anniversary of Thanthai Periyar organised by the Vellore Thamizh Sangam. Answering a question on the Aavin milk adulteration racket, he told journalists that there was corruption in several government departments. “To check it, a Lokayukta should be formed in Tamil Nadu.”
Mr. Thirumavalavan said the Narendra Modi government was against Eelam Tamils. “Prior to the Lok Sabha elections, it seemed a Modi government would help the Tamils get freedom. Now, it follows the policy of the Congress” that headed the ruling coalition at the Centre.
Protest in Chennai
He said the VCK would stage a protest in Chennai on September 23 against Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse addressing the U.N. General Assembly.

In an $80 million deal, the pharmaceutical major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries will acquire worldwide rights to US-based Merck & Co Inc's tildrakizumab, an investigational therapeutic antibody candidate, the company said.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, Sun Pharma said both the companies through their respective subsidiaries announced an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for tildrakizumab.
The drug is currently being evaluated in phase-3 registration trials for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, a skin ailment.
"Under terms of the agreement, Sun Pharma will acquire worldwide rights to tildrakizumab for use in all human indications from Merck in exchange for an upfront payment of $80 million," the statement said.
Merck will continue all clinical development and regulatory activities, which will be funded by Sun Pharma.
As per the deal upon product approval, Sun Pharma will be responsible for regulatory activities, including subsequent submissions, pharmacovigilance, post approval studies, manufacturing and commercialization of the approved product.
Merck is eligible to receive undisclosed payments associated with regulatory (including product approval) and sales milestones, as well as tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digit through teen percentage rates on sales.
"Sun Pharma is very pleased to enter into this collaboration with Merck, a recognized leader in the field of inflammatory/immunology therapies, for this late-stage candidate for chronic plaque psoriasis," Kirti Ganorkar, senior vice president for business development at Sun Pharma, was quoted as saying in the statement.
"This collaboration is a part of our strategy towards building our pipeline of innovative dermatology products in a market with strong growth potential," he added.
Following this, Sun Pharma shares gained 2 per cent on Thursday. Traders said it was the first time that an Indian company has taken global rights for a novel drug.
The traders also added that the deal will strengthen Sun's presence in the U.S. skin market and also boost revenue potential.

Gold prices recovered by Rs. 50 to Rs. 27,450 per ten gram in the national capital on Thursday on scattered buying by jewellers, tracking a firming trend overseas. However, silver remained under selling pressure and fell further by Rs. 490 to Rs. 41,000 per kg.
Traders attributed the recovery in gold prices to a better trend in global markets. Gold in London, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, added 0.2 per cent to $1,225.54 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity rose by Rs. 50 each to Rs. 27,450 and Rs. 27,250 per ten gram respectively. It had lost Rs. 60 on Wednesday. Sovereign, however, remained flat at Rs. 24,400 per piece of eight gram in restricted buying from retailers.

Markets on Thursday rose the most in over 3 months with Sensex jumping 481 points to 27,112.21 and Nifty soaring over 139 points to 8,114.75 as FIIs pumped funds on Fed’s pledge to retain rates at low levels for a considerable time and rising optimism over India’s trade ties with China.
With Dow Jones surging to record overnight, most Asian and European markets rose after the U.S. central bank stuck to a plan to begin raising near-zero interest rates only in 2015.
The 30-share BSE Sensex after opening in the negative zone rebounded to close above the key 27,000-mark for the first time since September 12. It ended at 27,112.21, gaining 480.92 points, or 1.81 per cent. This is its biggest single session gain in over 3 months since June 2 (467.51 points).
The gauge had gained over 138 points on Wednesday.
The Fed policy announcement on Wednesday night allayed fears of capital outflows. “With US rate rise possibilities becoming a more distant reality, emerging economies including India can expect to keep their hot monies ‘hot’ for some more time,” said Debopam Chaudhuri, Chief Economist, ZyFin Research.
Domestic investors also cheered stronger trade ties with China with the country committing investments worth $20 billion in India over the next five years.

The BSE Sensex reclaimed the 27,000-mark after a week by surging over 398 points at midsession on widespread buying by funds and retail investors amid optimism over trade ties with China and rise in foreign capital inflows.
The 30-share Sensex after opening in the negative zone rebounded to regain the psychological 27,000-mark for the first time since September 11 to trade 398.11 points, or 1.49 per cent, higher at 27,029.40.
The gauge had gained over 138 points in Wednesday’s trade.

Brokers said sentiments bolstered on optimism that trade ties with China would attract foreign inflows and revive country’s economic growth, triggering a flurry of buying by participants, helping the Sensex to regain 27,000-mark.
Meanwhile, China plans to invest around $500 billion overseas in the next five years, a large share of which is expected to find India’s way.
Stocks of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries rose 2.31 per cent after the company entered into a licensing agreement with Merck & Co for using investigational therapeutic antibody candidate, tildrakizumab, for treatment of plaque proriasis.

RBI needs to raise policy rates to bring down inflationRBI needs to raise policy rates to bring down inflation, says IMF

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs to further increase policy rates to bring down inflation on a sustained basis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Thursday.
In a note released ahead of the G20 meeting of Finance Ministers and central bank governors at Cairns in Australia, IMF said the government needed to take more steps to reduce stubbornly high inflation and the large fiscal deficit.
"Sustainably lowering inflation will also require further increases in the policy rate and a simpler monetary framework with clear objectives and operational autonomy for the RBI," said the IMF note.
Responding to the demand of industry to cut rate in view of declining inflation, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had recently said, "There is no point in cutting interest rates to see inflation picking up again."
The central bank is scheduled to announce its bi-monthly monetary policy on September 30.
The wholesale price (WPI-based) inflation dropped to a five-year low of 3.74 per cent in August, while the retail inflation was still at an elevated level of 7.8 per cent.
The IMF said removing supply bottlenecks would lead to more sustainable growth. It also called for increasing public spending on infrastructure to ease supply bottlenecks and support economic development.
While lauding the new government's emphasis on fiscal consolidation, it said "the quality and durability of the consolidation remain a cause of concern."
The government proposes to bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in current year from 4.5 per cent last fiscal.
The government had put in place a fiscal consolidation roadmap as per which the fiscal deficit has to be brought down to three per cent of the GDP by 2016-17.
Outlining the policy priorities before the G20, IMF said the group of 20 developing and developed nations should take steps to boost growth.
"Decisive structural reforms are needed across G20 economies to boost potential output and help ensure that growth is more sustainable," IMF said.
The 188-nation IMF said looking forward the global recovery should regain strength but downside risks have risen.
India will be represented by Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan at the G20 meet.

Mkts consolidate gains  mood remains upbeatShoaib Zaman      Follow @shobzm    Last Updated: September 19, 2014  | 20:11 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The equity markets continued to be in the consolidation mode as the benchmark index Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensex closed the week at 27,090, up 44.32 points from previous week.
Dipen Shah, head, private client group research, Kotak Securities believes that this is not a bad sign for investors. "Markets have sustained at near all-time highs, which reflects the strength of the market. There was relief on the US Fed not giving any indications of an early increase in interest rates. On the other hand, the moderation on WPI also improved sentiments a bit."
Among the A-group companies, the top gainers were Castrol India (13.88%), Hero MotoCorp (9.76%), Bharti Infratel (9.56%), Oracle Financial Services (9.43%) and Crisil (8.61%).
Among the top losers were Suzlon Energy (14.29%), Jindal Steel & Power (12.12%), Jaypee Infratech (10.47%),  Ramco Cements (9.70%) and ONGC (9.44%).
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold shares worth Rs 9.57 crore, while the domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares worth Rs 84.45 crore as on 18 September.
Major triggers for the market this week were industrial production and inflation data. The wholesale inflation in August rose 3.74% from a year earlier, much lower than July's 5.19%. On the other hand, the consumer price index marginally eased to 7.8% in August from 7.96% in the previous month on the back of decline in the vegetable prices.
However, the industrial production data fell to a four-month low, hurt by lower demand for the consumer durables and weak manufacturing data. The factory output data showed a growth of 0.5% in July as compared to a growth of 2.6% in the same period last year.
The markets, which had reacted negatively to the proposed US Fed plans of raising interest rates, were relieved to see that the Federal Reserve kept its record low interest rates for some more time. The US central bank hinted that it would reduce its purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities to $15 billion in October down from $85 billion a month last year.
Alex Mathews, head, research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services, says, "In the coming weeks, the US market data like existing home sales, market manufacturing PMI flash, new home sales, initial and jobless claims will be in focus. Also the GDP growth rate and consumer sentiment data will be watched."
"The Nifty can move up towards 8210-8275 in the short term. Nifty has support at 8040 and 7925," Mathew added.

Bank unions extend a cautious welcome to Jan Dhan YojanaBank unions extend a cautious welcome to Jan Dhan Yojana
Vinson Kurian 
Tweet
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, Sept. 19:  
The United Forum of Bank Unions (UBFU) has extended a cautious welcome to the Jan Dhan Yojana that aims to extend banking facilities to the unbanked people.
Its views were conveyed to the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) during the latest round of bipartite talks for wage settlement.
FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTS
But the UBFU expressed the fear that ‘compromises’ on KYC norms might lead to opening of fraudulent accounts for which employees should not be held accountable.
It also conveyed to the IBA that the pressure due to targets stipulated for opening of accounts were affecting delivery regular services to customers in significant manner.
Due to the stipulation on timings for opening of accounts from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., employees had to stay back beyond their working hours. The UFBU demanded that these matters needed to be duly addressed.
On the wages issue, the IBA insisted that the unions review their demand of a 25 per cent increase in payslip components since it was ‘beyond the paying capacity of banks.’
FLEXIBILITY ASSURED
To this, the UBFU responded by saying that the IBA may ‘substantially increase’ its offer of 11 per cent increase in the payslip components.
It also demanded that issues such as regulated working hours, five-day banking, and improvements in pension-related matters should simultaneously be discussed in a time-bound manner.
Also, negotiations need to be held at frequent intervals for an expeditious settlement of issues.
The UBFU extended a promise that it would be flexible in its demands depending on the response of IBA on all these matters.
IBA assured to schedule the next round of meeting within one week for comprehensive discussion on all the issues.
CLARIFICATIONS SOUGHT
The UFBU thanked the IBA for securing Government clearance for the resumption of the compassionate appointment scheme.
But it sought clarifications on issues like eligibility, applicability with regard to death cases prior to August 8, 2014, which the IBA assured to obtain from the Government and advise the unions thereafter.
Another round of bipartite talks between Indian Bank’s Association and the United Forum of Bank Unions was held in the afternoon yesterday preceded by a meeting of UFBU in the morning.
Rajeev Rishi was introduced as the new Chairman of the IBA negotiating team. He replaced TM Bhasin, who has been elevated as Chairman of IBA.

SBI associate banks to raise Rs 33 000 cr capital in next 5 yrsSBI associate banks to raise Rs 33,000 cr capital in next 5 yrs
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Sep 21, 2014 11:45 AM IST
Five associates of State Bank of India (SBI) would raise about Rs 33,000 crore capital to meet global risk norms -- Basel III -- in the next five years.
"It has been estimated that Rs 32,831 crore total capital is required under the Basel III capital adequacy framework for all SBI subsidiary banks between 2014-15 and 2018-19," a senior SBI official told PTI.
Part of the fund would be raised by the market while remaining would be provided by the parent SBI, the official added.
The country's largest lender has five associate banks -- State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Hyderabad.
Among these, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Travancore are listed entities.
Two of the subsidiaries have already taken board approval for raising funds through rights issue.
State Bank of Mysore (SBM) plans to raise Rs 425 crore through a rights issue as it has received in-principle approval from the board.
SBI holds 90 per cent stake in the bank, while the balance 10 per cent is with the public.
Similarly, board of State Bank of Travancore has also approved the rights issue of the bank for up to Rs 485 crore. SBI holds 79 per cent stake in the bank.
In order to maintain existing shareholding, SBI would have to subscribe rights issue proportionately. However, in case of preferential allotment, the fund would flow from the parent.
The unlisted subsidiaries like State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Hyderabad would get funds from the parent entity.
Besides, additional capital would be required needed for merger of associates banks.
"It is a question of scalability and viability. Additional capital would be needed in that case and so we have to see when the merger happens whether that much of funds is available that time," SBI managing director and group executive (national banking) B Sriram had said last month.
SBI first merged its associate State Bank of Saurashtra with itself in 2008. Two years later in 2010, State Bank of Indore was merged with SBI.

Afghan presidential candidates Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah to sign power dealAshraf Ghani Ahmadzai (Left) and Abdullah Abdullah (Right) were to sign the national unity government deal at the presidential palace at noon local time.
Associated Press | Kabul,afghanistan | Posted: September 21, 2014 1:02 pm | Updated: September 21, 2014 1:03 pm
Afghanistan’s two presidential candidates were set to a sign a power-sharing deal on national TV on Sunday, three months after a disputed runoff that threatened to plunge the country into turmoil and complicate the withdrawal of U.S. and foreign troops.
Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and Abdullah Abdullah were to sign the national unity government deal at the presidential palace at noon local time (0730 GMT), said the spokesman for President Hamid Karzai. The deal, agreed to in talks that began late Saturday, follows weeks of negotiations on a power-sharing arrangement following accusations of fraud in the June runoff vote.
The deal would be a victory for U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who first got the candidates to agree in principle to share power during a July visit to Afghanistan. Kerry returned to Kabul in August and has spent hours with the candidates in repeated phone calls in an effort to seal the deal.
As talks dragged out, Abdullah’s mostly northern supporters threatened to form a parallel government or react violently to any outright victory by Ghani Adhmadzai, a former finance minister and World Bank official whose power base is in the country’s south and east. For his part, Ghani Ahmadzai said he always maintained that ethnic politics in Afghanistan demand some sort of power sharing deal and not a winner-takes-all government.
The deal will see Ghani Ahmadzai replace Hamid Karzai as president. Abdullah will hold the newly created post of chief executive, akin to a prime minister.
Abdullah believes he won the first round of the election back in April by a margin of more than 50 percent, which would have precluded a runoff. But the official results showed him winning about 45 percent of that vote in a crowded presidential field of 10, not quite enough for an outright victory.
He also believes he won a June runoff with Ghani Ahmadzai. But official totals _ which the election commission said it would release on Sunday _ show Ghani Ahmadzai with about 55 percent of the vote.
A power-sharing deal was almost sealed about a week ago, but Abdullah then demanded that no vote totals from the runoff be released.
U.N. and Afghan election officials spent weeks auditing the runoff results after allegations of fraud, a common occurrence over Afghanistan’s last two presidential elections. But Ghani Ahmadzai’s runoff vote total only dropped by about 1 percent after the audit. Abdullah’s side maintained the fraud was so sophisticated it was undetectable.
In the end, high-stakes negotiations — and not a precise vote tally — appear to have settled the country’s power structure.
The U.S. has been pushing for a resolution so the next president can sign a security agreement that would continued…

ISRO geared up for a crucial manoeuvre of Mars Orbiter Mission on Monday0
0
Bangalore: Ahead of India's Mars orbiter's scheduled rendezvous with the red planet on September 24, the Indian Space Research Organisation is all set for the crucial fourth trajectory correction manoeuvre and test fire of the main liquid engine on the spacecraft on Monday.
The 440 Newton Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) engine now in an idle mode on the Mars Orbiter Mission for 300 days will be fired for about four seconds which, if successful, will boost the confidence level of ISRO about the success of insertion of the spacecraft into the Martian orbit.
"We are all set for the fourth trajectory correction manoeuvre and test fire of the main liquid engine, commands have already been loaded into the spacecraft for this event and has also been verified," a top ranking ISRO official said.
ISRO official said the event is crucial as the engine stored in the orbit for about 300 days without operation will be restarted for testing.
#isro #mars orbiter mission #mars mission #mars
He said the event is crucial as the engine stored in the orbit for about 300 days without operation will be restarted for testing.
"This test firing of the LAM engine is like a trial, which is going to be fired for a longer duration on September 24 for Mars Orbit Insertion," he said. The engine will be test fired for 3.968 seconds with fuel consumption of about 0.567 kg and with a decremental velocity of 2.142 meters/second.
The Mars Orbiter Mission, India's first interplanetary mission launched on November 5, 2013 by India's workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from the spaceport of Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh, will enter into Sphere of Influence of Mars on Monday.
On a 666 million km journey, the spacecraft escaped the earth gravity pull on December 1, 2013.
In case of any problem in Monday's manoeuvre, ISRO said it is ready with Plan B where in eight thrusters alone will be firing for a longer duration, probably consuming more fuel, and try to get in orbit around Mars.
In a critical act in the final moments on September 24, the orbiter has to be slowed down from 22.1 km per second to 4.4 km per second in relation to the red planet to be captured by the Martian orbit for the mission to be declared a success.
The engine would be fired for 24 minutes on that day to reduce its velocity and insert it into the Martian orbit.
If the Rs 450 crore MOM mission turns out to be a success, ISRO would be the fourth space agency in the world to have sent a mission to Mars. European Space Agency (ESA) of European consortium, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the US and Roscosmos of Russia are the only three agencies which have so far sent their missions to the red planet.
Only 21 of the total of 51 missions sent to Mars by various countries have been successful
If the final moments on September 24 are a success, India would be the first Asian country to go to Mars and also the first to succeed in the maiden attempt.
ISRO would utilise four ground stations for the operation --- Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) at Byalalu near Bangalore, Goldstone in USA, Madrid in Spain and Canberra in Australia.

10 ways twitter can help (or hurt) your businessPrint
>
The value of using social media for business has long puzzled marketers and entrepreneurs alike. Most companies now agree that engaging with customers on social media helps boost brands and may result in higher sales. But it remains tough to definitively prove return on investment through usage and measurement.
Twitter has been a particularly difficult sell in the ROI department. Twitter itself blogged that small and medium-sized businesses ask the social media site daily for "proof that their efforts on Twitter can lead to real business results." As a result, Twitter and Market Probe International fielded a study of 500 adults who follow small and medium-sized businesses on Twitter. Here's what they discovered:
-- 72 percent of followers are more likely to buy something from a business they follow.
-- 86 percent of followers are more likely to visit a business if a friend recommends it.
-- 85 percent of followers feel more connected with businesses after following them.
With Twitter tools steadily gaining traction in sales, marketing and prospecting for businesses of all sizes, it's important to understand how to get the most value out of your tweets -- and how to avoid social faux pas . As Gary Vaynerchuk, co-founder and CEO of VaynerMedia has said it: "There is no ROI in anything if you don't know how to use it."
Here are 10 ways Twitter can support or sink your enterprise:
1. Position yourself as a thought leader. Regardless of the market, businesses can use Twitter's platform to position themselves as industry experts. Alfred Poor, owner of The Center for Small Business says: "Share information that will be interesting and useful to your target market. Engage others in discussion about their tweets that are relevant to your topics."
2. Create a clear and consistent brand. Technologies like Twitter can distract businesses from creating a clear brand proposition, according to Tom Doctoroff, Asia Pacific CEO for J. Walter Thompson and author of the upcoming book, "Twitter Is Not a Strategy: Rediscovering the Art of Brand Marketing." Doctoroff emphasizes that new forms of technological engagement like Twitter are not, in and of themselves, creative ideas. "Twitter will fail to inspire purchases and brand loyalty unless coupled with the craft of brand building," he says.
3. Remember the 80/20 rule. You may have joined Twitter because you have content to share that promotes your business. Unfortunately, if you use the tool only for that purpose, you're likely to be tweeting in a vacuum. April Wilson, president of Digital Analytics 101, suggests remembering that it's about relationship-building -- not selling: "Eighty percent of your content should be about things that your target audience is interested in or wants, likes or needs to know. Twenty percent should be about sending them to or promoting your products and services."
4. Follow before engaging. It can be tempting to jump right in and attempt to strike up a connection with a business prospect on Twitter. But Eric Fischgrund, founder of marketing and PR firm FischTank, suggests becoming that person's follower first. He says: "This way, you have a better perspective of how they use Twitter to accomplish their own goals, which can help you learn more about possible synergies between your business and their own."
5. Add value to others. Social media creates an attention economy, so you need to stand out among the endless streams of content flowing past. The best way to make an impression with your professional network is to add value, says Lisa Colton, chief learning officer of See3 Communications. She says: "Respond when other people ask questions, retweet posts from people with whom you want to develop relationships and post content that's going to be valuable to others. Once you have attention by adding value, you can activate the network -- whether that's answering a question for you, retweeting your content or promoting your brand."
6. Share your personality (with discretion). Many social media experts believe blending professional and personal insights results in the best use of Twitter. "People will follow you for business purposes based on the value you provide them as a source of professional information and insight, but when it comes to doing business with you, they want to know what kind of person you are as well," says David Erickson, vice president of online marketing for Karwoski & Courage. " Sharing your personality and what you're like outside of your professional persona helps engender that trust."
However, Erickson and others recommend being smart about personal sharing. "Bring the personality without being personal," says Carin Warner, founder and president of Warner Communications. "If you are the owner of your company, for instance, avoid posting personal tweets that are irrelevant to your business, its goals or its mission."
7. Understand what's best to retweet. Any content you retweet should be relevant to the audience you're trying to connect with on Twitter. Aliza Sherman, co-author of "Social Media Engagement for Dummies," suggests retweeting with care. She says: "Make sure the tweets are in line with your own brand, since they show up publicly and can be perceived as endorsements."
8. Be careful what you "favorite." In addition to posting your own tweets or retweeting someone else's, you can use Twitter's "favorites" tool to help gain the attention of professionals with whom you want to connect. However, social media strategist Constance Aguilar suggests that businesses steer clear of favoriting political or controversial tweets, since favorites can be viewed by the public. She says: "Favorite tweets from journalists, publications and organizations that are positively associated with your industry."
9. Use direct messages sparingly. Direct messages have fallen out of favor with many who use Twitter for business . "Direct messages, while seemingly a shortcut to making a connection, tend to be a black hole of communication," says digital lifestyle expert David Ryan Polgar. Elizabeth Horodnyk, marketing communications coordinator at Eclipse Automation, agrees that DMs are usually frowned upon as they can be considered spam if the receiver is not very familiar with you. She says: "They should only be used if you already have a good relationship established or are asked to DM them."
10. Take the conversation offline. Twitter is the medium for connection, but once you have a forum to deliver a message that's more than 140 characters, it's time to connect outside social media. "Make the connection on Twitter, but take it to email or phone -- or better yet, in-person -- to really forge a strong relationship," says Jenna Saper, account executive at Affect Inc. According to Jennifer Ridgley, PR supervisor at Planit, once you and an influencer have made a meaningful connection, a DM can then come in handy: "Use public tweets to start the connection and DMs to follow up on that initial connection to discuss any opportunities."

Real Madrid romp to 8-2 win  Arsenal bounce backView Photo
Marseille's French forward Andre-Pierre Gignac, right, celebrates after scoring …
Real Madrid's early season woes disappeared with an emphatic 8-2 win over Deportivo La Coruna in the Spanish League on Saturday.
A goalless draw with Hamburg SV highlighted that Bayern has yet to find its best form this season, while Arsenal rebounded with a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa in England following a trio of domestic draws and a Champions League loss.
In Italy, Juventus went three points clear at the top after Carlos Tevez scored the winner at San Siro in a 1-0 win over AC Milan.
Here is a roundup of the action in Europe's top leagues:
___
SPAIN
Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat trick, Gareth Bale and Javier Hernandez added braces and Real Madrid rolled past Deportivo La Coruna 8-2 to end its two-game losing skid.
After Madrid romped, defending champion Atletico Madrid slipped to a 2-2 draw with Celta Vigo, while Granada rose into a provisional share of second place with Atletico after a 1-0 win at Athletic Bilbao.
Atletico and Granada are one point behind Barcelona before the leader visits Levante on Sunday.
Ronaldo scored his first two goals on either side of James Rodriguez's superb long strike to decide the match before halftime, and send Madrid on its way to its biggest away goal total in league play.
Rodriguez then helped the Ballon d'Or holder score his eighth goal in as many matches across all competitions.
ENGLAND
Mesut Ozil answered his critics to lift Arsenal out of its slump, while Liverpool fell to a second successive Premier League loss.
Ozil, Arsenal's record $70 million signing, ended an eight-match scoring drought stretching back into last season, and also set up Danny Welbeck's first goal for the club in a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa. Defender Aly Cissokho turned a shot into his own net as Arsenal scored three goals in 192 seconds.
West Ham inflicted Liverpool's third loss in five rounds, beating last season's runner-up 3-1.
ITALY
Carlos Tevez scored his fourth goal in three matches and Juventus won 1-0 at AC Milan in the first high-profile matchup of the season.
In the 71st minute at the San Siro, Paul Pogba set up Tevez with only the goalkeeper to beat and the Argentine forward expertly chipped it in over Christian Abbiati.
The victory gave Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri a measure of revenge against the club that fired him in January.
With three wins from three matches, Juventus moved three points clear of Milan and Roma, which hosts Cagliari on Sunday.
GERMANY
Hamburger SV held Bayern Munich to 0-0 in Josef Zinnbauer's debut as coach, while Julian Draxler scored and got sent off on his 21st birthday for nine-man Schalke.
Schalke drew 2-2 with Eintracht Frankfurt, which also had a player sent off.
Also, promoted Paderborn was provisionally top of the table after defeating Hannover 2-0. Elias Kachunga broke the deadlock in the 71st, then Moritz Stoppelkamp sealed the result deep in injury time with an audacious goal from 83 meters for a Bundesliga record.
Mainz defeated Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in the late game, costing the visitors the chance to go top.
FRANCE
Marseille striker Andre-Pierre Gignac scored twice in a 3-0 win over Rennes that provisionally lifted his club to the top of the French league.
Gignac, now the league's top scorer with six goals, opened with a spectacular scissors-kick before doubling his team's lead with a well-taken shot from the edge of the box.
Substitute Romain Alessandrini sealed Marseille's win in added time with a superb free kick.
Marseille's fourth straight league win put it level with Bordeaux but with a better goal difference after six rounds. Third-place Lille can overtake Marseille with a win against Montpellier on Sunday.

Microsoft delays the launch of its Xbox One console in China

Beijing: Microsoft has delayed the launch of its Xbox One game console in China, which had been set for release on Tuesday, but the world's biggest software company said it would be released by the end of the year.
Microsoft did not give a reason for the delay in a statement on Sunday.
The delay is the latest in a series of setbacks for Microsoft in China, where it is under investigation for suspected anti-trust violations related to the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office.
Microsoft's Xbox One game console, which had been set for release in China on September 23, will now be released by the end of the year.
#microsoft #xbox one #game consoles
The Chinese government lifted a 2000 ban on gaming consoles earlier this year. Microsoft had reached a deal with Chinese internet TV set-top box maker BesTV New Media Co Ltd to form a joint venture to manufacture the consoles in Shanghai's Free Trade Zone a year ago.
The Xbox One console will cost 3,699 yuan without the Kinect motion detection system and 4,299 yuan with Kinect, Microsoft said in July.
China is the world's third-biggest gaming market, where revenues grew by more than a third from 2012 to nearly $14 billion last year.
However, piracy and the dominance of PC and mobile gaming may leave little room for legitimate console and game sales.
In May, Sony Corp said it would set up a joint venture with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group to bring the PlayStation games console to China.

Heres why buying a diesel car doesnt make senseWhy buying a diesel car makes no sense any more
Simplus Information Services –  Tue 16 Sep, 2014 10:38 AM IST
There are many in India who preferred to buy diesel cars to save on fuel costs. Traditionally, diesel prices were always lower than petrol. However, it no longer makes sense to do so.
Here are 5 pointers that explain the development:
1. Price correction: International oil prices are down 14% since June 2014. It no longer makes sense to buy a diesel car. The difference in the price of diesel and petrol is narrowing rapidly.  At the same time, the Indian government has raised prices of diesel sold to us. As a result, petrol prices are falling and diesel prices are rising. The gap between a litre of petrol and diesel is less than 10 rupees now.
2. Recovery much longer: In 2011-12, when the price difference between petrol and diesel was the highest, it took only two and a half years to recover the high price or the premium you pay for a diesel car. However, today, it would take nearly 6 years for you to recover the money, according to CRISIL, the credit rating agency. This takes into account commute of 10,000 km annually.
3. Comparison: CRISIL compared Maruti Swift, Dzire, Honda Mobilo and Skoda Superb models for the difference in performance of diesel and petrol variants. The price difference between petrol and diesel variants of these cars ranges from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 3 lakh for Skoda Superb. While it would take over 5 years for Maruti Swift diesel version to recover the difference, it would take more than 9 years for Skoda Diesel variant to recover the premium paid.
4. Diesel car prices may fall: CRISIL expects manufacturers to slowly cut prices of diesel vehicles considering converging fuel prices. Every third small or medium sized car is a diesel car. However, diesel cars account for three-fourth or 75% of the utility vehicles sold, according to CRISIL. A section of analysts believe prices of diesel cars in the second-hand market would fall too. This means if you own a diesel car, the resale value of that car would drop too.
5. Commercial vehicles: The impact would be limited on commercial vehicles. They clock longer distances and usage of fuel is very high. Even a small difference would continue to benefit trucks and commercial vehicle users.

Leo Coffee gives global majors a stiff fight
R. Ravikumar
Has 40 outlets and 200 shop-in-shop counters
Chennai, September 21:  
As we enter the conference room on the first floor of the 150-year-old building, Venu Srinivasan, the young scion of Leo Coffee, is busy on the computer , he looks up with a satisfied grin.
“Please come. I just had to cross check some details about our consignment to California,” he says.
Leo Coffee, a nearly half-century-old filter coffee brand based in Chennai, still gives a stiff fight to the instant coffee and other filter-coffee brands from big domestic and international companies.
Growing exports
“Not just in the domestic market, we also export to countries such as the US, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and West Asian countries.”
Leo exports at least a tonne of roasted coffee beans and powder every month to the US alone. “Genuine coffee drinkers prefer filter coffee to instant ones and now “drinking filter coffee is fashionable,” says Srinivasan.
While refusing to give out details of the size of the business, he says Leo at present has 40 company-owned outlets and 200 shop-in-shop counters in supermarkets and department stores across the city.
It has also established the brand’s presence in e-commerce portals, including Amazon, Snapdeal, eBay and Shopclues.
“We are aggressive on e-commerce. We take technology very seriously. Right now, the volume we sell through these portals may be negligible, but it’s very promising.”
He says all these home-grown and international café chains are not a threat to traditional coffee brands such as Leo.
“They in fact complement. All these chains are focusing only on the out-of-home segment, but our aim is to be in every kitchen.” Leo also sells coffee filters.
Thanks to innovation, coffee brewing is not a 20-minute affair any more. Just three minutes, the decoction is ready in the ‘coffee percolator’.
Brand Mylapore Mocha
Besides, Leo has also entered into the café space under the brand Mylapore Mocha.
“We want to mark our presence in that space too.” As of now, it has half-a-dozen outlets. These outlets are not very elaborate like other Café chains. “We wanted them to be small joints where people can just enjoy a cuppa,” he says.
Besides filter coffee, Mylapore Mocha also serves various other beverages such as tea, iced tea, hot chocolate and badam milk. With Mocha, Leo targets all malls and even high streets.
Ask him how much coffee Leo sells every year. He says with a smile, “All I can tell you is at least a million cups of Leo coffee are being consumed every day.”

JSW Cement plans 4.3 mt plant in Karnataka
R Yegya Narayanan
Hopes demand to pick with construction activities in AP, Telangana
Coimbatore, September 21:  
JSW Cement Ltd is considering setting up a 4.3-million-tonne (mt) cement plant in Gulbarga, Karnataka.
The company is optimistic about demand revival in the South, as the economic activity picks up in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, said SS Sandhu, Associate Vice-President, JSW Cement, Secunderabad.
At present, JSW Cement has a capacity to produce 6.4 mt of cement with plants in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. Explaining the advantages of building a new plant in Karnataka, Sandhu said the company already has land in Gulbarga and the region is limestone-rich. Another advantage is that supplies could be made from Gulbarga to cement markets in Maharashtra and Gujarat.
Since the group company, JSW Steel, produces slag (a by-product of steel production), JSW Cement could manufacture slag cement, though limestone would be a critical raw material.
Asked about the economic slowdown, Sandhu conceded that there was “negative growth” in construction the South. But “stability” has come back. A lot ofprojects are expected to come up in the near future in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The new Andhra capital planned in Vijayawada would also spur building activity, he added. The company expects a pick-up in demand will drive up capacity utilisation to 75 per cent by the end of the current fiscal from 55-60 per cent now.
JSW Cement has a cement plant in Kurnool, Andhra Prdesh, with 4.8 mt capacity and a smaller plant with 0.6 mt capacity in Bellary, Karnataka. Besides, it had recently taken over a 1-mt capacity plant in Dolvi, Maharashtra, taking the group’s cumulative capacity to 6.4 mt. In view of the shortage of river sand, slag sand is being increasingly used as an alternative to make cements, he added. However, the share of retail sales of slag sand is less as it’s mostly used by cement makers.

Maharashtra: CM Chavan snubs NCP over  ultimatum   says is firm in saddle14
0
Mumbai: Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan on Sunday snubbed NCP over an "ultimatum" given by party leader Praful Patel on its demand to contest 144 seats in October 15 Assembly elections, saying that such discussions are not held through press conferences.
"Such discussions are not held through press conferences. Talks are on between the two parties," Chavan told reporters on the sidelines of a function in Navi Mumbai near. Addressing a press conference here yesterday, Patel told Congress to revert on the issue of seat-sharing and said that his party will "wait a day longer".
Against the backdrop of stalemate in the Congress-NCP camp over the seat-sharing formula, Chavan said Congress will declare its first list of candidates on Monday.
"Such discussions are not held through press conferences. Talks are on between the two parties," Prithviraj Chavan said.
#maharashtra #maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #praful patel #ncp
"A first list of the candidates would be declared tomorrow. None of the alliances have taken shape as of yet and list of candidates has also to be declared. Only a few days are left now," Chavan said.
Taking a swipe at his detractors, Chavan said, "Congress is facing the election under my leadership as the Congress high command has reposed faith in me." He was addressing a meeting of residents from Karad in Satara district in western Maharashtra living in Navi Mumbai, this evening. Karad is the hometown of the chief minister.
"I have sought ticket for Karad South Assembly constituency. I have conveyed to the high command that I would like to contest from my home constituency of Karad South. I have done a lot of work in the area and brought funds for the development in last three years," he said.
Amid reports that Chavan is searching for a safe seat, the sitting Congress MLA from Karad South, Vilaskaka Patil Undalkar has declared that he would contest as Independent if he is not renominated.
Pitching for his candidature from the seat, Chavan said, "I began my political career with the blessings of people of Karad and sought their help in the next phase of my political career."
"I have focused on developmental works and people-oriented schemes rather than personal matters. The transparency came after I took over. I resolved issues of people of Mumbai, Thane and even Navi Mumbai. Demands were heard of the people like mill workers who built Mumbai," the chief minister said.
Over 1000 people, hailing from Karad but currently settled in areas of Navi Mumbai, Thane and Mumbai, attended the function held at Shetkari Samaj Hall in Koparkhairane. "Karad is my hometown and I am deeply touched and motivated by the support my people have given me. With your help, we will be back in power on October 19," Chavan said.
Appealing to people to bring Congress back to power for "overall development" of the state and particularly of Karad and Satara district, Chavan said that the repeat of verdict of the Lok Sabha elections will prove "dangerous" for state. "I was asked to contest from various other constituencies but my native of Karad is close to my heart. While presenting the list of candidates to the Congress high command and scrutiny committee in Delhi I have expressed my keenness to fight the election from Karad and I am sure you people will help me win with huge margin to serve the state again," Chavan said.

Consolidated statements: Govt might give firms one more yearConsolidated statements: Govt might give firms one more year
Deepak Patel | New Delhi Sep 22, 2014 12:50 AM IST
The Union ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) is considering deferring a requirement for companies to come out with consolidated financial statements by a year, to 2015-16, after India Inc pushed for it.
The relief would be for unlisted companies. Listed ones already have to prepare consolidated statements once a year.
The requirement for such a financial statement for all companies arose due to provisions under section 129 of the new Companies Act, enacted last year. The section says every parent company, along with its standalone financial statements, has to prepare consolidated statements of itself and its subsidiaries, whether or not these are listed. The Act defines the word "subsidiary" broadly, to include associate companies and joint ventures.
"Traditionally in India, the primary financial statements of a company are its standalone financial statements. For, declaration of dividend is based on the standalone profits of the company and not on the consolidated profits of the group," said N Venkatram, managing partner, audit, Deloitte Haskins and Sells.
Therefore, the preparation, audit and adoption of consolidated financial statements were not covered under the earlier Companies Act, 1956. However, listed companies were required to present consolidated financial statements on at least an annual basis, under clause 41 of the Listing Agreement prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
Companies had asked for more time to comply with the new requirement for consolidation of statements. For this, the parent and subsidiary companies should necessarily follow the same accounting policies. If, due to regulatory or other requirements, the accounting policies of the two companies are different, it becomes difficult to consolidate their statements.
"Providing more time to implement the regulations would assist the industry to align the accounting policies of the holding and subsidiary companies," said Vijaya Sampath, senior partner, Lakshmikumaran and Sridharan Attorneys.
The new law also provides that if there are step-down subsidiaries, each subsidiary will also have to come out with a consolidated financial statement of its step-down entity. An exemption may be given if the step-down subsidiaries are wholly owned. "The government is also thinking to exempt wholly-owned subsidiaries from this rule," a senior MCA official, who did not wish to be named, told Business Standard.
In India, there are groups which have many step-down subsidiaries.
There are those who don't agree with the new provision for consolidated financial statements under the new Companies Act for a closely held group.
"Reporting of consolidated financial statement is for better understanding of the financial position of the group as a whole. If the group is closely held among family members, requiring compliance...(consolidated statement) for the (whole) group would not serve any purpose," said Sampath.
Business has also been apprehensive on the significant resource allocation needed.
For unlisted companies, "the share of net worth attributable to the minority shareholders would need to be determined and any unrealised intra-group profit between the company and its subsidiary/associate will need to be identified for elimination. These could involve significant efforts," said Venkatram.

Mars orbiter mission enters last legMars orbiter mission enters last leg
T E Narasimhan | Chennai Sep 22, 2014 12:50 AM IST
India is awaiting the dawn of September 24 with fingers crossed. The day will be engraved in golden letters if the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is able to put its satellite into the Mars orbit. As the clock ticks, excitement has enveloped the country with ordinary Indians and the scientific community wishing for a breakthrough.
With 48 hours left for the insertion, India will be the first country to enter the Mars orbit on a maiden mission if it succeeds. India will also be the first Asian country and Isro the fourth space agency to send a satellite to the red planet. European, US and Russian probes have managed to orbit or land on the planet, but after several attempts.
 
Isro scientists are confident the mission will succeed. A successful Mars mission will also boost the standing of Isro's launch vehicles, the PSLV and GSLV, and payloads for other countries to use at lower cost. India's $74 million Mars orbiter mission Mangalyaan costs roughly a 10th of Nasa's mission Maven.
At Isro's Bangalore ground station, officials have been busy for the past couple of days taking readings and conducting procedures. On September 17, command uplinks were uploaded and two days later Isro powered on major sensors and electrical subsystems required for inserting the spacecraft into orbit.
On Monday, Isro scientists will run a test of a main engine and make a small course correction. This is crucial because the engine has been idle for nearly 10 months.
"If you get tense, you tend to make mistakes. So far, things are going fine," said Isro Chairman K Radhakrishnan. The engine will be fired for four seconds and almost half a kg of fuel will be needed for this operation.
If there is a problem in test firing, Isro will use eight small thrusters for altitude control and orientation, which may not offer the original target but will salvage the mission.
On November 5, 2013, Isro's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle C25 took off from the Sriharikota space station, near Chennai, with five scientific payloads to observe the Martian surface.
NOT JUST A WEDNESDAY
4.17 am: Operations to insert the spacecraft into Mars’ orbit will start. The three antennas of the spacecraft will be activated
6.56 am: The craft will be rotated towards Mars. The craft’s insertion into Mars orbit will be from the dark side
7.12 am: The craft will enter eclipse
7.17 am: The liquid engine burn will start. The total burn duration is expected to be 24.14 minutes, consuming 249.5 kg of liquid propellant
7.21 am: The Mars occult will begin. Mars will be between Earth and the spacecraft, and the radio link with the ground station will be lost
7.22 am: Telemetry will switch off. The craft will execute all operations on its own
7.37 am: The eclipse will end, the Mars occult will continue
7.41 am: The liquid engine burn will end
7.42-8.04 am: A reverse manoeuvre will reorient the spacecraft’s antenna towards Earth
7.45 am: The Mars occult will end and 2 minutes later telemetry will resume. Scientists will get information about the burn performance
8.15 am: First information about the mission will be available from Australia. After an hour, India will be able to get data on its own
An objective of the mission is to develop technologies for design, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission. The technological objectives include design and realisation of a Mars orbiter with a capability to survive and perform Earth-bound manoeuvres, test a cruise phase of 300 days, Mars orbit insertion, and on-orbit phase around Mars, deep space communication, and navigation, among other things. The scientific objectives of the mission are exploration of Mars surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere.
The launch was followed by six Earth-bound manoeuvres between November 7 and November 16, 2013, to bring the spacecraft closer to exit the sphere of influence of Earth. The trans-Mars injection was carried out on December 1, 2013, and the spacecraft left the sphere of influence of Earth on December 4, 2013. After that, there was no coming back, whether the mission would succeed or fail.
From Earth's orbit, the spacecraft was moved in a heliocentric path to a destination around 224 million km away, where the craft meets Mars.
Events that will happen 224 million km away from Earth on September 24 will be watched and controlled by Isro's ground stations the Indian Deep Space Network in Bangalore, Goldstone in the US, Madrid, Spain and Canberra, Australia.
Once inserted in orbit, the spacecraft will complete one rotation around Mars in 3.2 Earth days taking pictures and sending data back to Isro for around 6-10 months. The life of the mission will depend on the quantity of fuel left in the craft.

Indigenously built spacecraft will soon attempt to enter Mars orbit; government mulls Ministry of Planetary Affairs

(Indigenously built spacecraft…)
NEW DELHI: How about a 'Ministry of Planetary Affairs' manned by officers from the 'Solar Family Exploration Service' and departments handling missions to Moon, Mars, Venus and Saturn? This is what a rather imaginative Modi government had come up with to explain a new cadre review policy while an indigenously built Indian spacecraft will soon attempt to enter the orbit around Mars, the Red Planet, after a gruelling 680-million-km journey.
Many ministries have been left foxed as well as amused by a 'Model Cadre Review Proposal' circulated to them last week by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), whose charge is with PM Modi himself.
The draft has been made by the DoPT to facilitate the various cadres for the exercise and a 10-page long proforma has been sent across on September 12 on how to prepare the note for the Committee of Secretaries for the cadre review. DoPT has circulated the proposal marked 'Secret' for a non-existing and imagined 'Ministry of Planetary Affairs'.
The note cites a template to say the proposal under consideration is for the review of cadre of the 'Solar Family Exploration Service', calling it a Organised Group 'A' Service under the Ministry of Planetary Affairs. "The officers of this service are responsible for managing the material supply chains to provide procurement and logistic support for solar missions of Government of India ," the note says.
"Apart from postings in the main ministry, i.e., the Ministry of Planetary Affairs , the officers of the Solar Exploration Service are also posted in the field formations and some other important ministries/departments like PMO, Ministry of Science and Technology and Organisations like ISRO. The field offices are situated at Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata," the DoPT note mentions.

Pressure on Switzerland on sharing bank account information

(The OECD’s Global Forum…)
CAIRNS: Pressure is building up on Switzerland to accede to India's request for information on its citizens who held accounts in HSBC's Geneva branch.
The OECD's Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information has taken up India's case and begun discussions on information sharing in cases of stolen data.
India has been trying to get Switzerland to share information on Indian bank account holders in HSBC Geneva on the basis of a detailed listed handed to it by the French government . Switzerland has so far denied this information, saying the demand was based on stolen data.
"The issue of information sharing on stolen data is being discussed at the global forum," said an official with a multilateral organisation privy to the development, giving a clear indication to the escalation of the issue at world level. This is expected to give a boost to Delhi's efforts to elicit information from Switzerland.
India has made several requests seeking information about its nationals holding bank accounts in Swiss Banks following amendments to the Double Taxation Avoidance Convention (DTAC) with Switzerland on October 7, 2011. The Swiss government has not provided the information sought, citing restrictions imposed by its domestic laws Delhi had time and again threatened to escalate the issue at global forums.
There was even a sharp exchange of letters between the Swiss finance minister and the then Indian finance minister P Chidambaram. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has also raised the issue.
India has received data about its citizen having accounts in HSBC Geneva from France under the bilateral tax treaty.
It has been widely reported that France had received that list after data was stolen by a disgruntled HSBC employee in 2011 and those names eventually found their way to tax authorities across the world, including India. The Swiss National Bank has reported on its website that deposits by Indians rose to about.`14,100 crore at the end of 2013 from about Rs8,547 crore a year ago.

Modi govt plans to set up new IITs with fore...Modi government plans to set up new IITs with foreign help

(The consortium of US institutions…)
NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi-led NDA government plans to establish five new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) announced in this year's budget with the assistance of foreign countries, just as the Congress did in the 1950s and '60s under then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's initiative.
The proposed IIT in Goa will come up in collaboration with well-known institutions in the United States, an official familiar with the matter said, adding that human resource development minister Smriti Irani will accompany Prime Minister Modi to America later this month to sign a joint declaration for this purpose.
The partner countries for the rest of the proposed premier engineering schools in J&K, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala will also be identified soon, the official added on condition of anonymity.
The IITs in Mumbai (then Bombay ), Chennai (then Madras ), Kanpur and Delhi were established in collaboration with the erstwhile USSR, then West Germany, USA and the UK respectively.
IIT Kanpur, for instance, had received technical assistance from a consortium of nine leading US institutions including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University and University of California at Berkley.
According to officials, the consortium of US institutions to help the proposed IIT in Goa will only be finalised once the two countries sign a joint declaration of intent. "The details of how many and which institutions will help IIT Goa and in what capacity will be worked out by the joint work group, which will be set up after India and the US sign the joint declaration," the official said. There are 13 IITs at present, with as many as eight set up between 2008 and 2011 under the mentorship of the existing institutes during the second term of the Congress-led UPA government.
Most of the newer IITs continue to function out of makeshift campuses and face difficulty attracting faculty of the desired calibre.
Despite such issues, the Modi government announced another five new IITs in its maiden budget for 2014-15 soon after taking charge in May. The finance ministry has allocated an initial sum of 500 crore for these institutes this year.
Responding to concerns regarding the proposed IITs against the backdrop of the wobbly infrastructure provided for the ones set up over the past few years, Irani had told ET in an interview earlier this month that she wasn't there to "fix the blame for the past but chart a course for the future".

KKR eyes $230 million share sale in Bharti InfratelKohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. eyes $230 million share sale in Bharti Infratel

Bharti Infratel
(KKR owns 4.5 crore shares,…)
MUMBAI|NEW DELHI: American private equity fund Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. (KKR) is set to launch a share sale that could raise about $230 million as it exits Bharti Infratel six years after investing, taking advantage of a sharp rebound in the valuations of the telecom tower company.
"It will be via block trades on the stock exchanges. KKR has already called for pitches from investment banks such as Morgan Stanley, UBS and Citigroup," a person with direct knowledge of the development said. "The intention is to launch it (the share sale) this week, but depends on a lot of variables, so it's not set in stone."
Bharti Infratel is run by India's largest phone company by revenue, Bharti Airtel. KKR and Bharti Infratel declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, UBS and Citigroup didn't respond to calls.
KKR owns 4.5 crore shares, or 2.38%, of Bharti Infratel, which has more than 36,000 telecom towers of its own. In addition, Bharti Infratel has a 42% holding in Indus Towers , the country's largest telecom tower company that's owned jointly by Vodafone India , Idea and Bharti Airtel.
At Friday's closing price of Rs309.75 on the BSE , the sale could fetch KKR about Rs1,393.9 crore ($232 million). This compares with its investment at Rs220 a unit totalling Rs990 crore ($250 million at 2008 rupee levels, but $165 million at current levels), meaning KKR would be getting less than it paid six years ago, thanks to the sharp rupee depreciation against the dollar in the interim.
"KKR has not made much money during the tenure. But since its investment tenure is coming to an end, it wanted to exit at least close to cost," said a banker in the know. "It has got an opportunity as the Bharti Infratel stock has risen sharply in recent times."
Since its IPO price of Rs220 in December 2012, Bharti Infratel's stock plunged to an all-time low of Rs148 in June 2013, mirroring the troubles in the telecom industry, and consequently the tower companies.
But an upswing in the fortunes of the sector amid call rate increases, less competition and a relatively clearer regulatory environment, meant a turnaround in the fortunes of the tower sector as well, including the financials of Bharti Infratel.
The company's stock has surged almost 83% in the year to date, and hit its all-time intraday high ofRs321.55 on Thursday. The broader stock market has also been buoyant in the past year or so, touching alltime records.
Many private equity funds are looking to sell stakes in mobile and tower companies as higher valuations are increasing pressure on them to exit to return money to limited partners, their investors.
On September 4, American private equity fund Providence Equity Partners sold a fourth of its holding in India's third-largest mobile telephony company Idea Cellular for approximately Rs1,414 crore in block trades in the stock market. It offloaded a 2.4% stake in the telecom operator by selling 8.5 crore shares acquired through investment arm P5 Asia Investment (Mauritius). At the end of the June quarter, Providence Equity Partners had a 9.31% stake in Idea Cellular.

MUMBAI: Maruti Suzuki is working on a low-cost hybrid technology to make its cheap-to-own cars even more frugal.
Maruti is aiming to make hybrids affordable and wants to offer the technology on cars right from the Alto, the cheapest in its product portfolio, to the Swift premium hatchback over the next three to four years, said people with knowledge of the carmaker's plans. In the process, it is taking the 'Kitna Deti Hai' (how many miles does it give) slogan to the next level. These people said Maruti's hybrid solution could deliver 20-30% more fuel economy.
"It is no more a concept. The real work is under way and the hybrid technology development is at an advanced stage," said one of the people. "A large part of the development is happening in Japan and key inputs from Indian R&D engineers are also being absorbed. The idea is to offer a technology to the mass with not a major price difference over existing petrol cars."
Hybrid vehicles usually have a non-conventional propulsion system, such as an electric motor, in addition to the engine that runs on conventional fuel. They also often include mechanisms to capture energy, such as while braking, to recharge the battery. While hybrid vehicles offer better fuel efficiency and are more environment friendly, heftier price compared with those running on conventional fuels has been the biggest hurdle for their wider adoption globally.
Maruti chairman RC Bhargava told ET in a recent interaction that Suzuki, the Japanese parent of India's No. 1 car maker by sales, has already started working on the hybrids. Maruti has communicated the need for a suitable hybrid car for India as well, he said. "We need a hybrid system suitable for small cars which is low cost. The systems available today are expensive. I do think the development of low-cost hybrid is necessary, quite like the AMT we came out with," Bhargava said.
Maruti was the first to introduce an AMT, or automated manual transmission, version in India with its Celerio. This clutch-less technology, which combines the fuel efficiency of manual transmission with the convenience of automatic cars without any major spike in the price of the hatchback, has been a major attraction for buyers.
"Nobody else does the AMT at that scale, but the Indian customers require that AMT in small cars. People can't afford to get an automatic at Rs 1 lakh premium," Bhargava said. "And, we need the same thing in hybrids."
Experts say if Maruti cracks the hybrid formula, it will be able to take the fuel efficiency of petrol cars beyond 25 kilometres per litre. By offering AMT at an affordable price, Maruti has already turbocharged the adoption of clutch-less cars in India, they say. One of the biggest advantages for Maruti is the sales volume it generates, which allows it to spread cost wide and keep prices low.
"The success of hybrid depends on affordability as the Indian consumer is highly value and cost-conscious," said Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst, forecasting, at IHS Automotive. "Maruti can penetrate the cost levels in India given the volume of its products."
Maruti is not the only car manufacturer in India trying to adopt the technology. The country's largest utility vehicle maker, Mahindra & Mahindra, is working on a hybrid version of the XUV 500, which will be the world's first diesel hybrid with a manual transmission. The project is codenamed W202 and the technology is expected to be ready for rollout in two years. Mahindra also makes electric cars through its Mahindra Reva unit, but such vehicles haven't seen much traction in India.
According to Maruti's Bhargava, pure electric cars may not sell in large volumes in India and, hence, his company won't commit significant investment to electric vehicles.
While Maruti's parent Suzuki has already developed a hybrid version of the Swift hatchback, it is not based on the low-cost solution that is under works and may take at least another couple of years to be ready.
Meanwhile, the central government, too, may chip in by offering subsidy support to hybrid vehicles under the National Mission for Electric Mobility. The mission document was approved by the National Council for Electric Mobility in 2012 and the industry is waiting for the new government to roll out the policy.
The mission statement sets the vision, lays the targets and provides the joint government-industry vision for realising the potential that exists for a full range of efficient and environmentally friendly electric vehicle (including hybrids) technologies by 2020. According to the projection, a saving of minimum 0.4 million tonnes of liquid fuel is expected with sales of 1.4-million units of electric and hybrid fourwheelers in 2020.
The huge import bill on crude oil is always a worry for India and to limit it, the automotive industry needs to start looking for viable alternatives, Vangaal said. On the government policy, he said its implementation remains a tough challenge. Government incentives at all levels from supply side to demand side and infrastructure to R&D will play a significant role in shaping the HEV (hybrid & electric vehicles) market in India, he said.

Siemens in agreed $7.6 billion deal to buy Dresser-RandSiemens in agreed $7.6 billion deal to buy Dresser-Rand
Sensex sheds 167 points in early tradeSensex up 116 points; consumer durables, FMCG stocks steal the show
Our Bureau/Agencies
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the green amid weak European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex rose 116.32 points or 0.43 per cent at 27,206.74 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty gained 24.85 points or 0.31 per cent at 8,146.30.
Rajesh Agarwal, Head-Research, Eastern Financiers, in a report said: "Going forward, the Sensex earnings multiple at 17 times FY15 earnings looks a bit stretched, and investors would be better off being cautious as the near term upside looks a little difficult. Some reforms have taken place but the quantum of impact on the bottom-line of corporates needs to be seen. Hot money, lower crude prices, monsoon not turning out to be as bad as was earlier expected, are some of the factors that are driving the markets. While we believe that markets could witness correction in short-term, earnings expansion, government initiatives towards infrastructure and strengthening economic data, provide comfort on the medium-term. We strongly believe that the Government’s pro-growth approach will aid the revival in the economy and would in turn boost equity markets."
Among BSE sectoral indices, consumer durables, FMCG, auto and oil & gas indices were the star-performers and were up 3.12 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.88 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, metal index fell the most by 1.22 per cent, followed by healthcare 0.89 per cent and India infrastructure 0.87 per cent.
Tata Motors, ONGC, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and SBIN were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Cipla, BHEL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Infosys.
Concerns over a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday, while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners' shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 per cent, also took its toll.
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the weekend said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 347.48 at 10:02 a.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.6 per cent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts slid 0.5 per cent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.8 per cent.

Stock market to remain range-bound ahead of F&0 expiryMarket to remain range-bound ahead of F&O expiry

Last week the US Federal Reserve indicated that it would keep interest rates low for a considerable period even after ending quantitative easing (QE). This would be a big positive for markets like India . It would mean that the flow of dollars will continue into growth markets.
Since the Lehman crisis the US economy has shown plenty of signs of recovery. However, this growth was purely driven on credit and therefore it has to be seen how the US economy performs after the ending of QE. Even if the US is able to stand on its feet - which the  market largely expects - the Federal Reserve will not increase rates anytime soon. It is unlikely that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be in a hurry to cut rates. It will be interesting to see RBI's next move in its monetary policy on September 30.
A rate hike in the US will be bad news for emerging markets. It will see an outflow of money from global markets including India to the US. The market has discounted the US increasing rates by July 2015. The fact that the US is not likely to hike rates in the near future  is the only trigger for  and the precise reason why the Indian market is trading in the positive zone.
This has also seen fund managers expecting the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex to climb higher. In the seventh Business Today-Morningstar asset allocation survey, 80 per cent see the Sensex hovering between 28,000 and 30,000 in the next six months, while no one expects it to fall - if at all it does - below 26,000 points.
In 2008, the Indian market had seen participation from all sources - foreign institutional investors (FIIs), mutual funds, insurance, retail and private equity. This time round it is just the FIIs.
In the last few months, mutual funds have started seeing some positive flows but it is more of high net worth individuals (HNIs) money, while participation from insurance is absent, retail is on the sidelines and private equity funds are finding ways to exit. Until there is greater participation from all segments, the Indian market is still on shaky ground.
With no near-term trigger this market will continue to remain rangebound. Any surprise from the second quarter results from India Inc could act as a trigger for the market. Advance tax numbers of some blue chip companies gives some hope that the September 2014 quarterly results could be positive.
Meanwhile, this week the Indian market is expected to take cues from global events. The market is also expected to remain range-bound ahead of the F&O expiry on Thursday. Last week, the market moved higher with most of the players covering their short positions which helped the BSE Sensex end above 27,000. This week the market will also keep an eye on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit and his meeting with President Barack Obama.

Yemen government signs peace deal withShiitesSmokes rises from near the Yemeni Government TV building, background, during clashes between Sunni militiamen and Hawthi Shiite rebels in Sanaa, Yemen, Saturday, Sept. 20, 2014. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Sanaa | Posted: September 22, 2014 9:42 am
Yemeni government officials and Shiite rebels signed a peace agreement on Sunday following days of violence that left more than 140 people dead and sent thousands fleeing their homes, state media said, although major rebel advances earlier in the day deepened a sense of uncertainty in the country.
The agreement calls for an immediate cease-fire and the formation of a technocratic government within a month after consultations with all political parties, a U.N. envoy said later at a joint news conference with President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi in the capital, Sanaa.
“The head of the government may not belong to any political group,” Jamal Benomer said, reading from the document, which, he added, also calls for security forces to be restructured based on consultations with the political parties.
Just hours earlier, state media reported that the country’s prime minister had resigned, but the president’s office denied it had received any such request.
The conflicting information came as the rebels, called Hawthis, seized numerous strategically important installations in Sanaa, including the Defense Ministry, the Central Bank, a key military base and Iman University, military and security officials said. An official at the Defense Ministry later said that the situation there was “normal and stable” and that the building had not been attacked.
The Hawthis have in recent months routed their Islamist foes in a series of battles north of Sanaa, and in recent days consolidated and expanded their grip on areas just to the north of the capital.
Their foes have traditionally been Sunni Islamist militias allied with the government or the fundamentalist Islah party. The Hawthis have been pressing for a change of government and what they see as a fair share of power.
In many cases, officials said the rebels handed over installations they captured to the military police or to popular committees comprising Hawthis and local residents to protect them against looting.
However, they dealt harshly with personnel and installations associated with their foes in years of war, such as the university, which was seen as a bastion of Sunni hard-liners and a recruitment hub for militants.
On Sunday afternoon, the official SABA news agency announced the resignation of Mohammed Salem Bassindwa but gave no details. A subsequent report by the agency quoted the president’s office as saying it had not received any such request.
Bassindwa took office shortly after former President Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced to step down. He has been in office since February 2012 and has been sharply criticized for his inability to deal with the country’s pressing problems.
The military base captured by the Hawthis is the headquarters of the army’s 1st Armored Division, an elite outfit led continued…

Can any Indian co replicate Alibaba success | Alibabas m-cap=TCS+ONGC+RIL+ITCAlibaba
(While India ticks all the…)
NEW DELHI/BANGALORE: When an online commerce company set up by a former English teacher in China makes a stunning debut on the US bourses, questions are bound to arise as to whether an Indian player can replicate the success.
While success in entrepreneurship is largely due to individual brilliance — as is evident from Alibaba's and its founder Jack Ma's spectacular IPO last week — other factors, including investment climate and government regulations, do play a key part.
Hangzhou, China-based Alibaba's shares soared almost 40% in its first day of trading on New York Stock Exchange as investors fought over a piece of what is expected to be the largest IPO in history
While India ticks all the right boxes when it comes to demand and potential for growth, the jury is out if an Indian ecommerce player would be able to do what Alibaba did within the next few years.
Industry pundits point out that India's ecommerce sector is at a stage where China was in 2007, but a combination of factors — such as low Internet penetration, supply chain and logistics hurdles and an archaic regulatory regime — act as barriers. "One cannot have this scale if you don't think of going global.
I don't see any company in India working toward that right now," said Rachna Nath, leader of retail and consumer at PricewaterhouseCoopers India. "That is the need of the hour."
 
According to a recent report by investment bank Avendus Capital, India's online commerce sector, currently valued at $3.1 billion (Rs 18,800 crore), is expected to gross about $5 billion (Rs 30,500 crore) by end of the current year, and is projected to hit over $11.8 billion (Rs 71,800 crore) in sales by end of 2015.
Impressive, but still tiny compared with the $542 billion (Rs 33 lakh crore) that China's ecommerce, which contributes more than 3% to the country's GDP, is expected to touch by 2015. "It's unfair to expect that we will produce a company the size of Alibaba right away, given the difference in basic denominators, such as GDP and retail market size of the two countries," said Kunal Bahl, co-founder and chief executive of Snapdeal.
According to Bahl, the strategy is to build an ecommerce company for the Indian market, and not to ape existing business models. "If you went to China in 2007-08, you would be asking the same questions of them, as you're asking about India's ecommerce sector now," said Bahl.
"It's not common to see billion- dollar businesses growing 300- 400% year-on-year. It's an unusual thing. I don't think there's any other industry in India growing at that kind of pace."
Regulatory roadblocks, however, continue to be a cause for concern, with Amazon India's recent tax issues with the Karnataka government highlighting the dissonance between prevailing tax norms and the demands of growth.
"The Centre needs to address a whole gamut of tax-related issues for retail industry, not just ecommerce. Otherwise, the ecommerce firms will be at the mercy of local tax officials in different states," said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail advisory firm Technopak.
High cost of customer acquisition incurred by India's ecommerce companies, adding to already-significant burn rates, is also a cause for concern. The average aggregate cost of acquiring users is estimated at between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.
"Establishing 'stickiness' is going to be an issue. There will always be margin pressure to keep prices low, given that customers tend to switch easily," said Ajay Relan, founder and managing partner of private equity firm CX Partners.
On a per-dollar basis, private equity investors earn more from their investments in China than in India.
Barriers notwithstanding, bigger ecommerce ventures in the country such as Bangalore-based Flipkart and Delhi-based Snapdeal, are building up technology platforms investing in infrastructure. "Reach is still limited. What is really desirable is the ability to deliver, manage logistics," said PwC's Nath.
In May, Snapdeal launched 40 fulfilment centres or warehouses across 15 cities, and said it plans on launching more over the next few months. Rival Flipkart runs about six such warehouses.
Both companies have crossed gross merchandise value (GMV), or value of goods sold on their website, of $1 billion (Rs 6,000 crore) in the past few months. This, however, pales in comparison to Alibaba, which reported GMV of $248 billion (Rs 15 lakh crore) for the previous fiscal, according to its draft red herring prospectus.
With the desktop revolution bypassing India, Snapdeal and Flipkart, along with their peers, are focusing on the mobile platform to drive deeper penetration in the country. India currently has a mobile subscriber base of over 900 million, one of the largest in the world.
"3G prices have been coming down and the growth of smartphones makes it very clear there will be a tsunami of new users going forward," pointed out Bahl.
Both Flipkart and Snapdeal see more than 50% of their overall orders coming from mobile. It's a strategy that has been accepted by global private equity and strategic investors, as they continue to pour money into the space. While Flipkart raised a massive $1 billion in financing in July, Snapdeal is also believed to have closed its latest funding round led by Alibaba and Japanese investor SoftBank.
Amazon chief Jeff Bezos has also committed $2 billion (Rs 12,000 crore) towards the e-tailer's Indian unit. "For Amazon, due to regulations in China, India is the only emerging market still open and it will never let go of that opportunity," said Rahul Khanna, MD at Canaan Partners, which has companies such as Naaptol and BharatMatrimony in its portfolio. "An Alibaba or not, we will see at least $5 billion companies from India in next 10 years."

MUMBAI: The S&P BSE Sensex slipped as much as 172 points in trade on Monday, led by losses in capital goods, metals and banks following weakness in the global markets.
"After taking a breather last week, the indices may continue to remain subdued at start this week," said IIFL report.

"The Nifty has given a sharp pull back rally of almost 8.49 percent. Now it is likely to face a stiff resistance in 8,150-8,220 band. If Nifty breaches this level, it may further go up to 8,350 in the extreme short term. However, a breach of 7,900 is likely to take Nifty lower to 7,800 and then 7,650 in the near future. We recommend holding long positions with stop loss of 7,900," said Microsec report.
"For the coming week, first support of Nifty is at 8,010 and the resistance is 8,150. If Nifty breaks 8,010, it may further go down to 7,950 and then 7,900. However, if Nifty is able to sustain above 8,150, the level of 8,190-8,220 would become the next target," the report added.

Overseas Investor Inflows in Debt Market Cross Rs 1 Lakh Crore in 2014 so far
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 21, 2014 21:45 (IST)
The Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
New Delhi: Foreign investors have pumped in over a staggering Rs 1 lakh crore into the Indian debt market since the beginning of the year primarily on account of government's reform agenda.
As per the latest data, foreign investors have purchased debt securities worth Rs 2,82,194 crore in this year so far, while they offloaded bonds to the tune of Rs 1,64,820 crore during the same period, resulting into a net inflow of Rs 1,17,374 crore ($19.45 billion).
These huge inflows included a net investment of Rs 14,900 crore in this month so far.
According to market experts, improved fundamentals of the Indian economy, a decisive mandate to the BJP-led NDA at the Centre, various reform measures announced by the government and high interest rate have caught the fancy of overseas investors (foreign institutional investors, sub-accounts and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).
The inflow is also significantly higher in debt compared to equities, which till date have attracted Rs 85,330 crore ($14.2 billion).
Most of the inflow into Indian debt has gone into government securities.
Since May 16 when the election results were announced, overseas investors have poured in close to Rs 86,000 crore in the Indian debt market, as the verdict met foreign investors' expectations in the Lok Sabha polls.
In 2013, foreign investors had pulled out a net amount of Rs 50,848 crore from the country's bond market.
Strong inflows in the recent months have taken the cumulative net investments of foreign investors into Indian debt market to Rs 2.22 lakh crore, while their investments in dollar terms are $44 billion.
This is based on the data since November 1992 when overseas investors began investing into Indian markets.

Chinese authorities have arrested six employees of a Shanghai food supplier to McDonald’s and other major restaurant chains in China after revelations of meat safety violations, the supplier said Friday. ( Robert Channick )
 Most Shanghai Husi workers had been on paid leave since July 21, when issues such as mixing expired meat and picking up products off the floor were exposed on Chinese television. The plant had been a major provider to McDonald's locations in Asia and to other major fast-food chains. 
 "It was our expectation that they could resume their work as soon as possible," OSI Group said in a statement. "Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond our control, this will not be the case."
OSI's meat producing plant in Shanghai was shut down in July over the safety allegations. Chinese police arrested six OSI employees this month in connection with the issue, which earlier prompted Oak Brook-based McDonald's to end supply contracts with OSI in China.

OSI Group on Sept. 2 handed control of a plant in Guangzhou, a city near Hong Kong in southeastern China, indefinitely to a subsidiary of competitor Golden State Foods Corp.
The food safety issue has been a blow to both OSI Group and McDonald’s, which saw its Asia sales fall sharply in July. OSI Group, through its subsidiaries, supplies products to McDonald’s, Yum Brands Inc.'s KFC and other major restaurant chains in China.
OSI Group established its first food processing plant in China in 1991 and began supplying products to McDonald’s the following year. The Shanghai plant opened in 1996.
The scandal, which spread as far as Hong Kong and Japan, sparked a Chinese probe into the firm and dragged down China sales at Yum and McDonald's, which have both since cut or suspended ties with OSI.
"Over the past two months, Shanghai Husi has experienced significant financial and customer losses and the authorities' investigations are still ongoing. It is very unlikely that production will be resumed soon," OSI said in the statement.
It added that a small of number of Shanghai Husi staff would be kept on to assist with the ongoing investigation.
"As such, Shanghai Husi cannot be fully shut down at this stage," the firm added.

Deficit rains likely to hit kharif foodgrain output by 7%Kharif foodgrain output likely to fall by 7% on deficit rains
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 19, 2014  | 20:16 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The country's foodgrain production is projected to drop by 7 per cent to 120.27 million tonnes (MT) in the kharif season of this year due to poor monsoon rains .
Foodgrain output was 129.24 MT in the kharif (summer) season of the 2013-14 crop year (July-June).
On account of 12 per cent deficit in rains so far, total area covered under kharif crops is lower by 3 per cent from the previous year.
Foodgrain output is estimated to fall by about 9 MT due to likely drop in rice production by 3.7 MT, coarse cereals by 4.5 MT and pulses by nearly a million tonne.
Releasing the first production estimate for kharif crop, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said, "...Coverage in sowing position is as per average of last five years and is only 3 per cent lower than the situation of last year. With improved rainfall, it is estimated that kharif foodgrain production will be approximately 120 million tonnes."
On farm growth projection for the current fiscal, he said the government would try to achieve the previous year's level despite adverse weather situation that has resulted in drought and floods in some parts of the country.
Singh said this is the initial and conservative kharif forecast, and production could rise in later estimates as observed in the past years.
As per the latest estimate, rice production is estimated to decline to 88.02 MT in the kharif season of 2014-15 crop year from 91.69 MT in the year-ago.
Similarly, production of coarse cereals is projected to drop to 27.05 MT from 31.53 MT, while pulses output would be lower at 5.2 MT from 6.02 MT.
On reasons for likely fall in kharif output, Agriculture Secretary Ashish Bahuguna said, "There was delayed monsoon rains which led to late sowing. This will of course have impact on crop productivity."
Due to lower area coverage and productivity, production of most of the crops is expected to be lower than their record production levels achieved last year, an official statement said.
The Agriculture Ministry has pegged oilseeds production at 19.66 million tonnes for the kharif season this year, as against 22.4 MT a year-ago.
Sugarcane output is projected to decline by 7.23 MT to 344.79 MT, while cotton output is estimated to fall by nearly 2 million bales to 34.62 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the review period.
"When I took over the ministry, there were fears of drought affecting the sowing acreage drastically. However, the improved rainfall and several measures including diesel and seed subsidy helped to reduce impact," the minister said.
State governments have been asked to gear up for rabi (winter) sowing and compensate the kharif production losses, the minister said at a press conference called to share his ministry's achievements in the first 100 days.
Singh announced that the government would launch a new scheme on crop insurance during this fiscal, while a separate programme on organic farming would be unveiled in the next 2 months.
On depleting onion stock and possible price rise in the commodity in October, the minister assured that the government would keep a check on prices of fruits and veggies.
when asked about rising number of farmers' suicides, Singh said it was because of the wrong policies of the previous government. "This is quite unfortunate. We will make efforts to boost farmers' income and agriculture growth."
On subsidies being given to poor people and farmers, Singh said, "About 70 per cent of people who are dependent on agriculture are also consumers. We are not giving subsidy directly to them. It is unfortunate that we give it to big companies. We are working on this.
It will be our effort that subsidy goes directly into the bank account of farmers and consumers. Perhaps, the government may start giving subsidy to account holders under the Jan Dhan Yojana."
On the issue of corruption in implementation of farm schemes, he said, "This is rampant in those states which are not doing well in agriculture. Agriculture is a state subject.
I wish states, which are not performing well, put in place a system to check corruption and walk the path of growth."
The minister assured that financial assistance would be provided to Haryana and Uttar Pradesh which have declared drought.
He also said that the government would make efforts to set up a central agri-university in Pusa in Bihar.

Kurdish fighters head to Syria to face militantsTurkish soldiers stand as Syrian refugees amass at the border in Suruc, Turkey, Saturday, Sept. 20, 2014. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Beirut | Posted: September 21, 2014 10:10 am
Hundreds of Kurdish fighters raced from Turkey and Iraq into neighboring Syria on Saturday to defend a Kurdish area under attack by Islamic State militants. As the fighting raged, more than 60,000 mostly Kurdish refugees streamed across the dusty and barren border into Turkey, some hobbling on crutches as others lugged bulging sacks of belongings on their backs.
The large-scale displacement of so many and the movement of the Kurdish fighters into Syria reflected the ferocity of the fighting in the northern Kobani area, which borders Turkey. Militants of the extremist Islamic State group have been barreling through the area for the past three days, prompting Kurdish leaders to plead for international help.
Civilians seeking safety began massing on the Turkish border on Thursday. Turkey did not let them in at first, saying it would provide them with aid on the Syrian side of the border instead. By Friday, it had changed its mind and started to let in several thousand.
The numbers grew quickly as more entry points opened, and by late Saturday afternoon, more than 60,000 had poured across the frontier, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said.
Even by the standards of Syria’s bitter war, it was unusual for so many refugees to flee in such a short time. Their numbers add to the 2.8 million Syrians who have become refugees in the past three years, and another 6.4 million who have been displaced within their own country — nearly half of Syria’s pre-war population of 23 million.
Many of those who came across Saturday cradled young children or carried them on their shoulders. Kurtulmus said some refugees were staying with relatives, while others took shelter in schools or tents.
“Kobani is facing the fiercest and most barbaric attack in its history,” said official Mohammed Saleh Muslim, head of Syria’s powerful Kurdish Democratic Union. The groups’ members dominate the Syrian Kurdish group known as the YPK, which is fighting the Islamic State militants.
“Kobani calls on all those who defend humane and democratic values … to stand by Kobani and support it immediately. The coming hours are decisive,” he said.
On Friday, the president of Iraq’s largely autonomous Kurdish region, Masoud Barzani, warned that the militant group’s attacks on the Kobani area “threaten the whole entirety of the Kurdish nation.”
The battle over Kobani is part of a long-running fight between the Islamic State group and Syria’s Kurds that has raged across a band of Syrian territory stretching along the Turkish border from the north to the far northeast, where large numbers of Kurds live. The clashes are one aspect of Syria’s broader civil war — a multilayered conflict that the U.N. says has killed more than 190,000,
The YPK is viewed with suspicion by many Syrian rebels and continued…

How are Kashmiris dealing with the natural calamityDal lake
(Everything is political…)
SRINAGAR: Great calamities bring searing images in their wake; scenes one intuitively realizes one will never forget. Kashmir had already had its share of death and destruction, enough to last its residents two lifetimes. A quarter of a century of brutal turmoil has mangled lives and bodies, rendered Kashmiris into a complex mass of severe trauma, resilience and resistance. Sometimes, there is the feeling that souls here have been so forged in blood-red pain that they have broken through normal psychological limits, and no longer suffer suffering like other humans do.
Death, violent death, is at home in Kashmir. And people used to it somehow just aren't affected the same way it can affect other people. How else do you try to describe a state of being where streets and lanes you have walked, cycled through, played in as a green teenager, now resembling a post-apocalyptic, flooded, landscape leaving you somehow dry? It hurts, it's like a probing cold instrument running along the seams of old wounds, but somehow you're not in tears.
The searing images are there:
in what you yourself see, in what your friends and colleagues and people you don't know tell you about what they have seen. For some it is that sight of debris and carcasses floating in their homes, for others the story of how someone was begging to be rescued, how babies were crying with hunger and thirst, how desperate people held up their children from first- or second-floor windows in inundated homes hoping against hope that that the stray rescue boat would pay attention. Or an unrecognizable body floating slowly by. Or how people who lost their homes had a distant look in their eyes.
But sometimes there are other images, even if they are somehow, well, quieter. It can be the sight of that bloated rat or, rather, the touch of a slithery, dead thing against your foot as you walk in cold flood water in your slippers across a badly affected area, and look down to see it. Or it can be the sight of scores of people standing on a bridge of your childhood, in an area where you were born and spent the first 12-odd years of your life, hauling, with ropes, a barge right across the furious current of a still-swollen Jhelum, with four people in the barge unwinding a thick electric cable to the other side. The sagging cable across the river had been swept away by the surging water which rose almost till the railings of the bridge, and here were people not waiting for an absent government to fix it.
Or it could be the sight of a paisley — that delicate curvature of embroidery every Kashmiri feels an affinity with — on what must have been a lovely jamavar shawl, dripping crimson tears while hanging out to dry after being hauled out of a flooded handicraft shop.
You could call the first one an image of the real threat of disease that is now, two weeks after the waters first rose, raising its menacing hood over the already beleaguered people. The second, a picture of the sort of incredible self-help people have displayed. And the third, an image of pure sorrow, of the latest tragedy of Kashmir, a tragedy that many feel will change the face of the land they love for a long, long time to come.
****
For Kashmiris living away, it was a different sort of terror when news first started filtering out of the flood back home. Already, more than two weeks earlier, there was the emerging sense that this would be one of the 'big ones', and later it was confirmed that this was the worst flood in over a century. Now, imagine a situation where you hear of such a deluge, and you simply don't know, even as day upon long day begins to pass, whether your family is alright, or dead, or what has happened to your friends.
Bunches of Kashmiris began to gather in Delhi and elsewhere, each hungry for the smallest scrap of information — almost all communication links were utterly dead — and the odd, rare phone call someone had got, the 'news' communicated over social media or texts was the sole source which people began to pore over, sift and examine. Some mobilization began; efforts to form volunteer groups to try and send aid back home. In some days it was clear that most of Srinagar was under water and even as people prepared to either head back home or organize relief efforts from outside, there was that other source of bile-inducing anger: much of the Indian media.
Everything is political in Kashmir. Even a flood. And even people stressing that this is not the time for politics know that. And much of the Indian media, which has habitually been the greatest source of disinformation and rank propaganda on Kashmir, seemed to go into an insane overdrive. What do you call a 'reporter' (and the TV channel he or she works for), shoving a mike into the face of the harrowed, exhausted person rescued by the army and asking, "Are you grateful to the Indian army now?" Even propaganda has a code. Here, there seemed to be none.

Jammu and Kashmir floods: Health services limping back to normalHealth services
(Clean up operations at hospitals…)
SRINAGAR: After the recent floods and unprecedented waterlogging, Health Services in Kashmir Valley are returning to normal with district hospitals catering to patient rush, especially from rural areas. The Health and Medical Education Department has set up 58 mobile health clinics in Srinagar city as water has been drained out from G B Pant Hospital, L D Hospital and SMHS Hospital, an official spokesman said.
Clean up operations at hospitals have begun and once electricity and water connectivity is restored they will start operating, he said.
Four mobile hospitals have been pressed into service to reach out to people in need, the spokesman said.
Quoting reports from other parts of Kashmir, he said all the district hospitals are running normally and catering to patient rush from rural areas.
Health and Medical Education Minister Taj Mohiuddin , who is monitoring the health services, directed the department to start anti-measles vaccination in flood-affected areas on a war-footing.
The Minister, who is in constant touch with the Health authorities in Delhi, said at present, six lakh anti-measles vaccines are ready and more are on their way to Srinagar.
He directed Health authorities to press more vaccination teams into service in the camps where people from flood-hit areas have been housed.
The SMHS Hospital has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 100 crore to its machinery and diagnostic equipment due to waterlogging and floods, the spokesman said.

Floods caused Rs 1K-crore loss to apple crop in KashmirApples
(The floods have caused a…)
JAMMU: The floods have caused a loss of Rs 1,000 crore to the apple crop in Kashmir, threatening a collapse of the horticulture industry in the state, says a report.
"Floods have washed out Kashmir apple's crop worth Rs 1,000 crore leaving a devastating impact on growers and the collateral damage for the consumers in rest of the country, who should be prepared to pay high prices in the coming festival and rest of the winter season, an Assocham report said after an assessment of the crop loss.
The worst-hit districts of Baramulla, Kupwara and Sopore are the largest producers of apple and extensive damage has been reported there, the report said.
"Horticultural production of the state contributes about 50 per cent of the Rs 2,000 crore agricultural production of the state involving 30 lakh people. Apple production accounts for 86 per cent by value of the state's horticultural output," it added.
"Apple is the mainstay of Kashmir's economy with a turnover of Rs 1,200 crore a year and its production in the state has reached about 1.6 million metric tonnes annually," the Assocham report pointed out.
The sector also employs nearly 30,00,000 people directly and indirectly, it said, adding apple accounts for a lion's share of total fruits produced and contributes about 10 per cent to state domestic product (SDP).
" Kashmir apples , known for their taste and juice, have already lost a huge market share to those grown in other north Indian states due to the low prices of the latter variety," D S Rawat, Secretary General of Assocham, said.
"Kashmir apples are favourite not only in the domestic market but also abroad. With the supply line closed from Kashmir, the price of apple has already started shooting up and the ensuing Navratra season will see further jump by 40-45 per cent. As the supply from rest of the country will not be able to make up for the loss, dependence on imports will also increase," said Rawat.
The wholesale market organisers in Delhi are projecting more than 60 per cent fall in the quantity of apples from Kashmir in the entire season, it said.
Rawat said, "The devastating floods in Jammu and Kashmir have damaged the best varieties of Kashmiri apples that were to hit markets by September-end."
Most families in Sopore in north Kashmir and Shopian in the south are involved in the cultivation of the fruit that flourishes in the hilly environment. Orchards in Kashmir Valley once known as the fruit bowl of India are full of fragrant apples but growers fear the disastrous year of business, the Assocham report said.
The horticulture industry in Kashmir earns over Rs 1,200 crore yearly, a major share of which comes from the apple crop. It also generates Rs 500-600 crore for the state exchequer annually, the report added.
Kashmiri apple varieties like the red, glistening 'firdous' and 'amri' have over the years become hugely popular world over, it said, adding India is the world's 11th largest apple producer.
Though apple is the major fruit grown in Kashmir, especially in Sopore in north and Shopian in the south, other fruits like cherry, peach, apricots and pears are also grown on a large scale, it said.
Kashmir's apple and pear varieties are considered best in the world. While the fruit production in the Valley is around 15 to 17 lakh metric tonnes annually, the growers say Kashmir has a capability to produce 25-30 lakh MT every year.

TiEcon Delhi 2014 aims to attract happening startups(For those tracking entrepreneurial…)
By Jyoti Pande Lavakare
For those tracking entrepreneurial activity for years, the most natural places to network and get a pulse of the industry are the TiEcons — possibly the largest professional conferences for entrepreneurs in the world, organized as region-specific and sector-specific events, crowned by one annual general event in the larger cities.
However, over the years, the conferences organised by The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE), a not-for-profit global network of entrepreneurs and professionals, had become a little boring — the same speakers, the same topics, the same poster boys, and mostly even the same locations. And really, how many times can one listen to yet another talk on funding, mentoring, pitching, revenue models and term sheets?
So when the emails for TiEcon Delhi 2014, an annual event scheduled this year for October 17-18 began popping into my inbox beginning last week, I glanced over them cursorily, expecting to see the same old names and similar-themed sessions. But to my pleasant surprise, not only were the speakers different — new, lesser-known names — but the themes were young and fresh. "The sessions are value-driven, not name-driven this time," said Upasana Sharma, director, TiE Delhi-NCR. Called "Abki Baar Disruption", the TiEcon Delhi is tagging some of the most happening entrepreneurial themes and startups.
Just one of the latter is an app called Handshake that entrepreneur Subinder Khurana will launch at TiEcon 2014, which promises to revolutionize the concept of networking.
App-solutely Brilliant
Once delegates register, they will get to download the free app that acts as a virtual handshake and will alert you to the immediate presence of people you're most likely to want to meet. This novel way of networking — using technology to advantage — will allow delegates to discover contacts present in their vicinity, within a radius of 100 metres, making networking more efficient and effective.
In addition to facilitating discovery, the app also provides a context to both parties. Says Khurana, who has a team of developers and business analysts working on implementing this: "Networking is the major reason for most people to attend events. The problem we are solving is: discover who is around, and get more context before you meet them." In addition, Handshake will seamlessly transfer business cards, without stripping them of their brand information. The app is almost ready and in the final stage of development and testing. It will be launched at the conference in a win-win formula where Khurana gets to test the beta version among an ideal audience and the entrepreneurs get to network in the most efficient manner possible.
"The app does not rely on GPS — though we will use GPS if available [global positioning system is a satellite-based navigation system]. Rather, it uses a proprietary discovery mechanism to find contacts currently present in the same building," says Khurana. It basically mines social networking sites like Linked-In, Facebook, Google Plus, aggregating data and adding location filters using a proprietary technique.
Once he is able to gauge the app's success, Khurana will spin off a new company under the same umbrella parent whose revenue model will be based on the app's in-app purchases. "Handshake will always be free to individual users. We will launch a premium (paid) version of it, with enhanced functionality later," Khurana says. Of course, the premium version will have higher functionality, such as enhanced branding support, analytics and reporting, and a corporate version, but then one has to pay for that. The possibilities of such an app are immense. Imagine you're at an airport, mandatorily ahead of time. The unproductive time between check in and take-off can now be productively utilized, if your app alerts you that the bored-looking gent sitting next to you waiting for his flight runs a venture capital fund or has the exact skills your company needs. And you don't need to approach him cold. The app will provide you with all the context publicly available on him before you even turn around and introduce yourself. If that isn't agile and innovative, (and a little spooky), then I don't know what is!
  Setting the Stage
Meantime, the event itself will resort to innovative plans — like that of a young founder getting a chance to be mentored on the move, literally. "Mentoring in Motion" gives young delegates the opportunity to pick up a charter member (i.e. a founding member) and accompany him to the TiEcon in a pre-booked cab, giving them the chance to make pitches and discuss ideas en route. By using unproductive commute time to the conference venue, this is mutually beneficial for both mentors and mentee.

Only one in five start-ups gives good return: Expertse-commerce
(Experts believe, with all…)
NEW DELHI: India has witnessed a boom in the e-commerce/start-up sector in last five years but only one out of five start-ups gives good returns, while three do not give any return or simply fold up, say experts.
Moreover, as the focus has now shifted to developing and encouraging more start-ups, there is a definite chance that many start-ups and .coms would find it difficult to flourish amid tough competition from already established ones.
"The excitement around e-commerce is real but the valuations may be a bubble," The Chennai Angels member Kayar Raghavan said, adding that, "one out of five startups gives good returns while three do not give any return or simply fold up."
Experts believe, with all these major players who are already operational and making profits smaller set ups find it tough to gain second round of funding or hard to continue further after the funding. Between 2012-2014 alone there have been many start-ups shutting shop.
"Exits" for initial investors are difficult to come by not just in India, but across the world.
Sometimes, earlier investors get to exit partially or fully at subsequent fund raising rounds. Another form of exit happens through consolidation/M&A. IPO is the other preferred route.
Raghavan noted that investors to the startups get few exits but when one does indeed get an exit through whatever means (secondary or M&A), that is highly likely to be only profitable.
"Redbus, Snapdeal, Myntra, Flipkart, Mu Sigma, JustDial, LetsBuy, makeMyTrip, Chakpak, Rediff, etc, are examples although a couple of these may have made money for only early investors," he added.
Another member of The Chennai Angels Mithun Sacheti said "exits are not always profitable. Exit in itself means a return on capital, which would be positive or negative. But it is better than having no option to exit and being a part of a living dead company".

Russian tycoon Yuri Milner eyes Indian startupsRussian tycoon Yuri Milner eyes Indian startups
By Samidha Sharma, TNN | 19 Sep, 2014, 12.54PM IST
Milner is expected to make investments of about $5 million each in Olacabs and Mumbai-based startup Housing.com, in his personal capacity.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI: Russian tycoon and one of the biggest tech investors in Silicon Valley, Yuri Milner has set his eyes on Indian startups at a time when top dollars are flowing into new-age, domestic internet and mobile firms from the most high profile global investors. Milner is expected to make investments of about $5 million each in Olacabs and Mumbai-based startup Housing.com , in his personal capacity, multiple sources close to the development told TOI who did not want to be identified as the deals were yet to close.
DST Global, Milner's investment company, is a significant shareholder in Bangalore-based e-commerce biggie Flipkart, however, if the two transactions go through they would be the 52-year old's first personal investments in India. Milner in his personal capacity has made more than 50 investments across largely US startups, as per data compiled by CrunchBase, most of which are in the seed-to-early stages . Few of his recent personal investments were made in Xapo, education startup Coursera, Twist Bioscience among many others.
When contacted by TOI, Bhavish Agarwal, co-founder & CEO of taxi-startup Olacabs and Advitiya Sharma, co-founder, Housing.com, did not offer any comments on the fund-raise. An email sent to DST Global remained unanswered till going to press.
Interestingly, both Ola and Housing have been founded by IIT-Bombay graduates starting up in Mumbai's Powai neighbourhood, a fertile ground for many startups which mushroom out of the IIT-B campus.
Milner's investment is expected to be through the primary route but the transaction with Ola and Housing may involve some secondary sale of shares as well by existing investors, sources said.
Known as being the most successful social media investor in the Valley with Facebook and Twitter being a part of DST Global's portfolio, Milner is scouting opportunities in the India market which has seen heightened investor action across consumer tech companies with the likes of Flipkart raising a billion dollars at a $7 billion valuation last month.
Buoyed by increased smartphone penetration the 200 million strong internet user base in India is the next big opportunity for investors after China. In China, DST is an investor in Alibaba,which is in the midst of floating its shares on the US bourses valuing the Jack Maled e-commerce giant at over $150 billion, and also in JD.com. German startup incubator Rocket Internet, which too is going public also counts Milner's fund as one of its investors.
Milner built one of the largest internet companies in Russia the Mail.ru group, took it public and then started making investments in Silicon Valley tech firms with its $200 million bet on Facebook in 2009.
Having come to the Valley as a relative unknown, Milner bulked up the DST portfolio by sinking in millions of dollars behind fast-growing internet firms and is today one of the most sought after investors globally. Over the past few years, DST started ploughing big money into Chinese internet companies as Asia became an important investment destination for the multi-billion dollar fund.Earlier this year, it led a $210 million financing round in India's largest e-commerce company signalling the Russian investor's interest in domestic tech firms.
DST Global, boasts of one of the most stellar portfolios in the Silicon Valley with investments in 17 (six have gone for an IPO) companies including the likes of Airbnb, Spotify, Zynga, ZocDoc, GroupOn among others. DST, focuses on making investments in late-stage, high-growth, private companies largely in the internet space. The investment firm is famous in the Valley for introducing a model wherein it provides liquidity to founders, employees and early investors through a mix transaction of primary and secondary sale—known as DST type deals.

Nearing Growth Goal  but More Needed From Europe: G20You are here: Home Economy
G20 Says Nearing Growth Goal, but More Needed From Europe
Reuters | Updated On: September 21, 2014 14:50 (IST)
Commercial Mining of Coal to be Allowed After Auction: Finance Minister
Cairns, Australia: The Group of 20 nations says they are tantalisingly close to adding an extra $2 trillion to the global economy and creating millions of new jobs, but Europe's extended stagnation remains a major stumbling block.
The finance ministers and central bank chiefs gathered in the Australian city of Cairns claimed progress on fireproofing the world's financial system and on closing tax loopholes exploited by giant multinationals.
They also dealt with the thorny problem of whether to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the G20 leaders' summit in November given events in Ukraine, with the consensus being to maintain diplomatic pressure but leave the door open for his attendance.
"We are determined to lift growth, and countries are willing to use all our macroeconomic levers - monetary, fiscal and structural policies - to meet this challenge," said Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey, who hosted the event.
Almost 1,000 measures had been proposed that would boost global growth by 1.8 per cent by 2018, nearing the ambitious goal of 2 percentage points adopted back in February.
A common concern was the risk of Europe's economic malaise pulling others down. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew cited "philosophical" differences with some of his counterparts in Europe, especially on the need for near-term stimulus.
"The concern that I have is that if the efforts to boost demand are deferred for too long, there's a risk that the headwinds get stronger and what Europe needs is some more tailwinds in the economy," Mr Lew said.
That was not an argument that found favour with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble who emphasised the need for structural reforms and strict budget controls.
The proposals to lift global growth will now go for formal approval at the summit of G20 leaders in Brisbane in November.
Chief among them was a global initiative aimed at increasing private investment in infrastructure, a particular hobby horse of the Australians who head the G20 this year.
China gets a pass
While Europe's failings were front and centre, there was surprisingly little said about China's slowdown, at least publicly. That struck some as odd given the Asian giant was just behind the United States in the size of its economy.
"Our basic point on the aspirational growth target is that with China slowing down in a structural sense... it will be exceedingly difficult to hit that (2 percent) number, given China's massive arithmetic impact," said Huw McKay, a senior international economist at Westpac.
China's finance chief, Lou Jiwei, noted that stimulus measures also brought problems such as excess capacity, environmental pollution and growing local government debt, just the latest sign that any policy easing there would be limited.
The risks that super-loose monetary policy could inflate asset bubbles was also much discussed by the G20, along with the need for the Federal Reserve to avoid spooking markets as it winds down its quantitative easing campaign.
The US central bank is widely expected to end its asset-buying program in October and to start raising interest rates next year, a marked contrast to the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan where even more easing might be needed.
Bank buffers
Regulators are looking at increasing the size of the capital buffer that the world's top banks need to hold to reduce the risk of a repeat of the global financial crisis.
European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said a buffer of about 16 per cent of risk-weighted assets was realistic but had not been finalised. A figure would be announced at the leaders' summit, he said.
Also on the drawing board were plans to stem the loss of revenue from multinationals shifting their profits to low-tax countries, potentially reclaiming billions of dollars.
Taxation arrangements of global companies such as Google Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have become a hot political topic following media and parliamentary investigations into how many companies reduce their bills.
"We have endorsed far-reaching initiatives to identify and catch tax cheats through the automatic exchange of information using a Common Reporting Standard," Australia's Mr Hockey said.
"We encourage others to match this commitment so that there are no places to hide."

Why it matters if stores smell deliciousMixing up a sale?(Reuters/Eric Gaillard)

Smell can add ambience to your retail experience, but can the right scent really get you to stay longer and purchase more?
Consumer researchers say the answer is a pretty overwhelming affirmative. Researchers have found that smell effects consumer  thoughts and spending behavior , product judgements  (pdf), judgements on store environments and intentions on visiting stores .
More recently, a  study published in January  (pdf) in the International Journal of Marketing Studies surveyed 400 customers and examined the effect of the presence and absence of an ambient scent on customers. Researchers reaffirmed that customers “felt greater pleasure and stimulation, expressed intention to revisit the store and spent more in a scented environment than in an unscented one.”
“Smell is one of the most unique of human senses,” said Jennifer Dublino, vice president of development at ScentWorld Events, the scent marketing industry’s US-based trade group. “Scent enters the limbic system [of the brain] and bypasses all of the cognitive and logical thought processes and goes directly to the emotional and memory areas of the brain. There’s an instant effect on the customer.”
According to Dublino, the global scent marketing industry is growing at a rate of 15% per year. Asia is the fastest-growing market, with Latin America and the Middle East following closely behind.
So how do you actually use scents to sell?
“We look for inspiration in everything from the customer’s overall corporate objectives right down to store material or the types of employee interaction with their consumers,” wrote Ed Burke, director of marketing and communications for ScentAir, a major US-based scent marketing company, in an e-mail to Quartz.
When a brand approaches ScentAir, Ed Burke, the company’s director of marketing and communications explains, the company’s fragrance development team tests different ingredients to arrive at a scent that most adequately suits that brand’s image. Scents are broken up into “families” ranging from aromatic to woody and attributes range from clean to warm. The best scents for a retailer may vary based on the image that store is trying to portray, Burke explains. ScentAir has 80,000 client locations in 109 countries—major customers include United Colors of Benetton and Hugo Boss.
In fact, scent has been found to be  such an effectively subtle means of boosting sales, a new question has emerged: Is it ethical?
“Scent affects mood and scent affects emotion,” says Kevin Bradford, a marketing professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business told Canada’s Globe & Mail recently . “It works without you having the opportunity to filter it. To me, that is extremely unethical.”

Airlines want new route guidelines changedAirlines want new route guidelines changed

New Delhi, September 21:  
The Government’s plans of revising the guidelines that domestic airlines have to follow to operate in India have run into rough weather as a number of airlines have written to the Ministry of Civil Aviation expressing concerns about the proposed guidelines.
The new guidelines have made changes to the existing route dispersal guidelines by designating 30 routes as trunk routes instead of the earlier 12. These include those between Chennai-Hyderabad, Bengaluru-Pune and Delhi-Patna. From now all other routes will be designated regional routes.
In its submission, SpiceJet has requested “withholding” the implementation of the revised policy till all stakeholders come to a consensus. This, the airline points out, will ensure minimal operational impact and passenger inconvenience. SpiceJet’s presentation adds that the airline’s current schedule has evolved over time and entails many important aspects including crew resourcing, slot historicity and engineering requirements. The airline further says that the changed guidelines will mean that it will have to amend its schedule drastically to even meet the first set of changes, which start from March 2015Vistara — the full service airline project to be launched by Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, has “humbly suggested” that new airlines be exempted from these requirements for an initial period of five years. “The new airline would be much better placed to contribute to regional connectivity in the country once it has fully established itself” and started international operations, the airline says. At the moment the Government’s policy stipulates that an airline which has flown in domestic skies for five years and has a fleet of at least 20 aircraft is permitted to start international operations.
GoAir has suggested that the number of trunk routes be limited to flights between metro cities and that the requirement of regional route capacity deployment should be capped at 50 per cent of operations on trunk routes. Jet Airways has also expressed a similar opinion, pointing out that the policy requirement to deploy 100 per cent of trunk route capacity on regional routes could result in overcapacity.

Asian Shares Slip, Dollar Pulls Away From Highs
Reuters | Updated On: September 22, 2014 08:05 (IST)
The Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
Tokyo: Asian shares skidded on Monday as investors awaited data this week that could provide more evidence of a slowdown in China, while the dollar gave back a little of its recent gains.
China's flash manufacturing PMI reading on Tuesday could come in below the 50 level, indicating that manufacturing activity is contracting.
"The psychological effect of a below-50 reading will be significant and consistent with the slew of softer Chinese data over recent weeks." Mitul Kotecha, head of FX strategy Asia-Pacific for Barclays in Singapore, said in a note to clients.
China will not dramatically alter its economic policy because of any one economic indicator, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said on Sunday, in remarks at a meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the Group of 20 nations who met in the Australian city of Cairns. His remarks came days after many economists lowered growth forecasts having seen the latest set of weak data.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.8 per cent. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.7 per cent, after it marked its highest closing level since 2007 on Friday, and gained 2.3 per cent for the week.
Alibaba Group, in one of the biggest IPOs ever, ended up 38 per cent at $93.89 on massive volume on Friday. Because the Chinese online retailer's stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is not an S&P 500 component, its gains were not reflected in major indexes and it did little to help an otherwise lacklustre day on Wall Street.
The G20 leaders said they were close to adding an extra $2 trillion to the global economy and creating millions of new jobs, but Europe's extended stagnation remained a major stumbling block.
The dollar gave up 0.2 per cent against a basket of major currencies to 84.600, after the index posted its 10th consecutive week of gains on expectations that US interest rates would rise more quickly than had been expected.
The Federal Reserve should start raising US interest rates in the spring, earlier than many investors currently expect, and should do so both slowly and gradually, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said in an interview on Fox Business Network on Friday.
But the outlook for US monetary policy remains murky. The Fed issued a policy statement at the close of last week's two-day meeting that suggested the first rate hike wasn't due until around the middle of next year.
The greenback eased about 0.2 per cent against its Japanese counterpart to 108.85 yen, moving away from a six-year high of 109.46 yen scaled on Friday.
The euro edged up 0.2 per cent on the day to $1.2854, after earlier drifting down to touch a fresh 14-month low against the dollar of $1.2826.
Sterling added 0.4 per cent to $1.6351 after it soared on Friday following Scotland's vote to reject independence.
Spot gold shed 0.2 per cent to $1,212.56. Last week, gold posted a 1 per cent drop for its third consecutive weekly fall.
Brent crude dropped 0.5 per cent to $97.91 a barrel, while US crude for October delivery, which expires later on Monday, fell about 0.3 per cent to $92.13.

Climate change pressures spur fledgling trend to divest from fossil fuels
In the run-up to a United Nations summit this week aimed at combating climate change, a small but growing number of multimillion-dollar investors are demanding more aggressive steps to wean countries from fossil-fuel consumption.
The fledgling movement to divest shares tied to fossil fuels, which started at a handful of universities and foundations, has grown to 180 institutions and local governments and 654 individuals, with a total of $50 billion in assets, according to a report to be issued Monday afternoon by an activist group that works with investors.

“John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil, moved America out of whale oil and into petroleum,” said Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which currently has about 7% of its assets invested in fossil fuels. “We are quite convinced that if he were alive today, as an astute businessman looking out to the future, he would be moving out of fossil fuels and investing in clean, renewable energy.”
Separately, almost 350 global institutional investors representing more than $24 trillion in assets have called on governments to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions and phase out subsidies to fossil-fuel industries. The signatories to the carbon-price statement include the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or CalPERS, BlackRock and major investors from Europe, Asia and Australia.

The moves illustrate a potentially important shift in the position that many business interests have taken regarding climate change. Even while the subject remains controversial among political figures, with many Republican officials in the U.S. disputing the existence of man-made climate change, growing numbers of investors and corporations are trying to curtail fossil-fuel consumption and prepare for global warming’s damage.
“Investors are owners of large segments of the global economy as well as custodians of citizens’ savings around the world,” said Achim Steiner, U.N. undersecretary-general and executive director of the U.N. Environment Program. “Having such a critical mass of them demand a transition to the low-carbon and green economy is exactly the signal governments need in order to move to ambitious action quickly.”
The combustion of fossil fuels, such as oil, coal or natural gas, releases carbon dioxide, the main driver of a considerable rise in average global temperatures over the last 150 years. Scientists say the effects of climate change are already being felt in areas including agriculture and public health. To avoid widespread damage, governments must soon cut emissions sharply, most scientists say.
In January, 17 foundations with about $1.8 billion in assets had committed to divest, said Ellen Dorsey, executive director of the Wallace Global Fund and a founder of the group issuing the report, the Global Divest/Invest Coalition . Since then, another 50 foundations with billions more in assets have signed on, she said.
Worldwide, 30 municipalities have chosen to divest including Oakland, Santa Monica and Berkeley. Stanford University decided to shed investments in coal from its $18.7-billion endowment, although it retains other fossil-fuel investments.
The divestment effort is far from an easy sell, however. On Friday, the University of California Regents decided to continue holding fossil-fuel investments.
Harvard and Yale, which have the two largest university endowments in the country, also declined to divest. Still, Yale’s chief investment officer, David Swensen, wrote to money managers about the perils of investing in fossil fuels, asking them to assess “the direct costs of the consequences of climate change on the expected returns” from their investments. Investments “with relatively small greenhouse gas footprints will be advantaged” relative to ones with a larger impact on the climate, he wrote.

Hong Kong: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's initial public offering now ranks as the world's biggest in history at $25 billion, after the e-commerce giant and some of its shareholders sold additional shares.
Overwhelming demand saw the IPO initially raise $21.8 billion and then send Alibaba's stock surging 38 percent in its debut on Friday. That prompted underwriters to exercise an option to sell an additional 48 million shares, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said.
The IPO surpassed the previous global record set by Agricultural Bank of China Ltd in 2010 when the bank raised $22.1 billion.
Under the option, Alibaba agreed to sell 26.1 million additional shares and Yahoo Inc 18.3 million, netting the two companies an extra $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion respectively.
Alibaba's Jack Ma agreed to sell an extra 2.7 million shares and company co-founder Joe Tsai agreed to sell 902,782 additional shares, according to the prospectus.
The source declined to be identified as the details of the additional sale have yet to be made official. Alibaba declined to comment.
Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley acted as joint bookrunners of the IPO.
Rothschild was hired as Alibaba's independent financial advisor on the deal.

Australia to prohibit secret servicetorturePrint
Associated Press | Canberra | Posted: September 22, 2014 10:04 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 10:07 am
The Australian government has bent to public pressure by proposing a specific prohibition on secret service officers torturing suspected terrorists.
The government had planned to indemnify Australian Security Intelligence Organization officers against all criminal offenses committed in the course of their undercover work except for homicide, causing serious injury, sexual assault and serious damage to property.
Attorney General George Brandis announced on Monday that torture would be added to that list, after the opposition and other critics complained that ASIO officers should not be protected from legal liability for torturing suspects.
Because torture was against Australian law, no operation involving torture could ever be authorized, Brandis said.
“I’ve decided to add an explicit prohibition in relation to torture in so far as concerns special intelligence operations,” Brandis told reporters.
“I want to stress there is absolutely no necessary legal reason to do this. I am doing so because it is something that ASIO is perfectly happy to have expressed on the face of the legislation and so as to avoid this debate being diverted by an issue that is nothing but a red herring.”
ASIO’s Secretary General Duncan Lewis, who took over Australia’s top domestic spy agency last week, said torture was contrary to Australia’s international obligations.
“The Australian Security Intelligence Organization has never practised torture, it does not practise torture and it never will,” Lewis said. “And for that reason, I’m perfectly happy that this addition is placed into the proposed legislation.”
George Williams, a University of New South Wales legal expert, said the amendment to specifically prohibit torture was necessary to prevent intelligence officers from being able to torture with impunity. The amendment legislation will be introduced to Parliament on Wednesday.
Williams, whose university has been studying Australian counterterrorism laws for several years, said some of the laws went too far.
He said the United States and Britain both had a higher terrorism threats than Australia, but neither country had the equivalent of Australia’s preventative detention orders. Under such orders, suspected terrorists can be held for up to 14 days without charge. The suspects aren’t allowed to disclose their whereabouts, even to family.
The orders, which were introduced in 2005, were used for the first time last week when police arrested 16 people during counterterrorism raids in Sydney. One man was charged with conspiring with an Islamic State movement leader in Syria to kidnap and behead a randomly selected person in Sydney. He remains in custody. Another three men were held under preventative detention orders, but have since been released.
A sunset clause means the legislation that created the orders will expire in December 2015.
The government had planned to make that legislation permanent. But Brandis said that after consultation with Muslim leaders, he had decided to include another 10-year sunset clause that will extend the legislation to 2025.
Australia raised its terror warning to the second-highest level two weeks ago in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of the Islamic State group.
Because torture was against Australian law, no operation involving torture could ever be authorized,

NASAs Maven explorer arrives at Mars afteryearIn this artist concept provided by NASA, the MAVEN spacecraft arrived Mars on a mission to study its upper atmosphere.
Associated Press | Cape Canaveral | Posted: September 22, 2014 10:03 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 10:08 am
NASA’s Maven spacecraft arrived at Mars late Sunday after a 442 million-mile (711 million kilometer) journey that began nearly a year ago.
The robotic explorer fired its brakes and successfully slipped into orbit around the red planet, officials confirmed.
“This is such an incredible night,” said John Grunsfeld, NASA’s chief for science missions.
Now the real work begins for the $671 million mission, the first dedicated to studying Mars’ upper atmosphere.
In this 2013 file photo, technicians work on NASA’s Mars-bound spacecraft. The Maven spacecraft reached Mars after completing the 442 million mile journey from Earth. (Source: AP photo)
Flight controllers in Colorado will spend the next six weeks adjusting Maven’s altitude and checking its science instruments. Then Maven will start probing the upper atmosphere of Mars. The spacecraft will conduct its observations from orbit; it’s not meant to land.
Scientists believe the Martian atmosphere holds clues as to how Earth’s neighbor went from being warm and wet billions of years ago to cold and dry. That early wet world may have harbored microbial life, a tantalizing question yet to be answered.
NASA launched Maven last November from Cape Canaveral, the 10th U.S. mission sent to orbit the red planet. Three earlier ones failed, and until the official word came of success late Sunday night, the entire team was on edge.
“I don’t have any fingernails any more, but we’ve made it,” said Colleen Hartman, deputy director for science at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “It’s incredible.”

The spacecraft was clocking more than 10,000 mph (16,000 kph) when it hit the brakes for the so-called orbital insertion, a half-hour process. The world had to wait 12 minutes to learn the outcome, once it occurred, because of the lag in spacecraft signals given the 138 million miles (222 million kilometers) between the two planets on Sunday.
“Based on observed navigation data, congratulations, Maven is now in Mars orbit,” came the official announcement. Flight controllers applauded the news and shook hands; laughter filled the previously tense-filled room.
Maven joins three spacecraft already circling Mars, two American and one European. And the traffic jam isn’t over: India’s continued…

Rural jobs: Centre tells states to focus on 2 500 blocksPrint
Written by Ruhi Tewari | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:00 am
In a move that may be aimed at narrowing down the scope of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), the Centre has informally asked states to focus its implementation in the 2,500 blocks designated as backward under the Intensive Participatory Planning Exercise.
The Rural Development ministry, in July this year, prescribed the exercise to ensure “greater focus” on backward blocks. Blocks were identified based on the percentage of population below the poverty line as per Planning Commission estimates of 2013.
However, according to the Rural ministry officials, states have been informally told to focus only on these blocks, thus conveying the government’s message on limiting the focus of the Act. “No official communication has been sent but yes, states have been informally told to keep their focus only on the backward blocks. A general sense in the government is that there is wasteful expenditure on the scheme with too much being put into implementation in blocks where it is not needed,” a ministry official said.
The sources said senior officials were in fact conducting state-wise visits to hand-hold states through the exercise and ensure the focus remains on the 2,500 blocks. They also said that since limiting the scope of the Act formally would require an amendment to the Act, the government was trying to ensure a more streamlined implementation this way.
Focus on these blocks will mean more effort will be put in to generate demand in these areas, and planning of works here would be a priority. “While the idea is to ensure funds are better utilised, it does amount to diluting the scheme to an extent. Once focus is shifted to limited blocks, it will mean barely any effort will be made in the others, unless people themselves demand work,” another official said.

MUMBAI: Maruti Suzuki is working on a low-cost hybrid technology to make its cheap-to-own cars even more frugal.
Maruti is aiming to make hybrids affordable and wants to offer the technology on cars right from the Alto, the cheapest in its product portfolio, to the Swift premium hatchback over the next three to four years, said people with knowledge of the carmaker's plans. In the process, it is taking the 'Kitna Deti Hai' (how many miles does it give) slogan to the next level. These people said Maruti's hybrid solution could deliver 20-30% more fuel economy.
"It is no more a concept. The real work is under way and the hybrid technology development is at an advanced stage," said one of the people. "A large part of the development is happening in Japan and key inputs from Indian R&D engineers are also being absorbed. The idea is to offer a technology to the mass with not a major price difference over existing petrol cars."
Hybrid vehicles usually have a non-conventional propulsion system, such as an electric motor, in addition to the engine that runs on conventional fuel. They also often include mechanisms to capture energy, such as while braking, to recharge the battery. While hybrid vehicles offer better fuel efficiency and are more environment friendly, heftier price compared with those running on conventional fuels has been the biggest hurdle for their wider adoption globally.
Maruti chairman RC Bhargava told ET in a recent interaction that Suzuki, the Japanese parent of India's No. 1 car maker by sales, has already started working on the hybrids. Maruti has communicated the need for a suitable hybrid car for India as well, he said. "We need a hybrid system suitable for small cars which is low cost. The systems available today are expensive. I do think the development of low-cost hybrid is necessary, quite like the AMT we came out with," Bhargava said.
Maruti was the first to introduce an AMT, or automated manual transmission, version in India with its Celerio. This clutch-less technology, which combines the fuel efficiency of manual transmission with the convenience of automatic cars without any major spike in the price of the hatchback, has been a major attraction for buyers.
"Nobody else does the AMT at that scale, but the Indian customers require that AMT in small cars. People can't afford to get an automatic at Rs 1 lakh premium," Bhargava said. "And, we need the same thing in hybrids."
Experts say if Maruti cracks the hybrid formula, it will be able to take the fuel efficiency of petrol cars beyond 25 kilometres per litre. By offering AMT at an affordable price, Maruti has already turbocharged the adoption of clutch-less cars in India, they say. One of the biggest advantages for Maruti is the sales volume it generates, which allows it to spread cost wide and keep prices low.
"The success of hybrid depends on affordability as the Indian consumer is highly value and cost-conscious," said Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst, forecasting, at IHS Automotive. "Maruti can penetrate the cost levels in India given the volume of its products."
Maruti is not the only car manufacturer in India trying to adopt the technology. The country's largest utility vehicle maker, Mahindra & Mahindra, is working on a hybrid version of the XUV 500, which will be the world's first diesel hybrid with a manual transmission. The project is codenamed W202 and the technology is expected to be ready for rollout in two years. Mahindra also makes electric cars through its Mahindra Reva unit, but such vehicles haven't seen much traction in India.
According to Maruti's Bhargava, pure electric cars may not sell in large volumes in India and, hence, his company won't commit significant investment to electric vehicles.
While Maruti's parent Suzuki has already developed a hybrid version of the Swift hatchback, it is not based on the low-cost solution that is under works and may take at least another couple of years to be ready.
Meanwhile, the central government, too, may chip in by offering subsidy support to hybrid vehicles under the National Mission for Electric Mobility. The mission document was approved by the National Council for Electric Mobility in 2012 and the industry is waiting for the new government to roll out the policy.
The mission statement sets the vision, lays the targets and provides the joint government-industry vision for realising the potential that exists for a full range of efficient and environmentally friendly electric vehicle (including hybrids) technologies by 2020. According to the projection, a saving of minimum 0.4 million tonnes of liquid fuel is expected with sales of 1.4-million units of electric and hybrid fourwheelers in 2020.
The huge import bill on crude oil is always a worry for India and to limit it, the automotive industry needs to start looking for viable alternatives, Vangaal said. On the government policy, he said its implementation remains a tough challenge. Government incentives at all levels from supply side to demand side and infrastructure to R&D will play a significant role in shaping the HEV (hybrid & electric vehicles) market in India, he said.

Sterlite working on Google Fibre project cloneAirtel
(Under its build-to-demand…)
KOLKATA: Telecom engineers and fibre specialists at Vedanta Group company Sterlite Technologies are finalising the 'proof of concept' of a close variant of the 'Google Fibre' project to transform the urban home broadband experience in India's top 20 cities and, in turn, boost high-speed internet penetration.
But unlike the US search giant, which will directly take its ultrafast fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) drive across US cities, Sterlite will deliver super-fast fibre broadband connectivity at 20 to 50 Mbps speeds to urban homes through partner mobile operators.
"We will shortly showcase our FTTH broadband technology blueprint to Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices to line up the first wave of partnerships," Sterlite Technologies CEO Anand Agarwal told ET. The company is initially looking to hook up a million homes by 2016 across Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Chennai.
"Sterlite's faster home broadband model has parallels with the Google Fibre project as the network and services to end consumers would be similar, but company roles will be different as we plan to work with telcos as catalyst-cumsystem integrators to create a pan-India urban broadband network, unlike Google, which will directly serve US consumers as an internet service provider," said Agarwal.
Its plan to partner with telcos comes at a time when mobile operators are increasingly focusing on data revenues to fuel future growth.
"A faster fibre broadband option along the lines of a 'Google Fibre' can be handy for incumbents Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India or Idea Cellular, which are known to be cherry picking lucrative data customers in urban zones in anticipation of intense competition from Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio Infocomm, which is reckoned to launch its 4G voice and data services by March next year," a Mumbaibased sector analyst said, requesting anonymity.
At present, Google's ultra-fast fibre internet service is reportedly available in Kansas City and Provo, Utah, and will be expanded soon to Austin, Texas. According to international news reports, Google plans to take its faster home broadband service to some 34 US cities shortly.
Elaborating on Sterlite's fibre broadband model, Agarwal said the company would deliver last mile broadband connectivity to an urban home by plugging its FTTH network to the nearest point of interconnect (PoI) of a partner mobile operator, which could be an exchange or base station.
Agarwal, however, agreed that Sterlite's FTTH network expansion would hinge on telco demand for using its fibre-to-home technology. "We will ink revenue-sharing pacts with telco partners only after jointly assessing whether a particular urban neighbourhood is ready for fibre," he said.
Under its build-to-demand approach, the company will extend last mile fibre optic internet connectivity to individual homes and residential high rises only after "it is assured of adequate demand for faster broadband services at the consumer end".
Incidentally, Sterlite Technologies is a key optic fibre cable supplier for the Rs 21,000-crore national optic fibre network (NOFN) project that will be take high-speed internet to 2.5 lakh village blocks across the country. It has also secured contracts to supply such cables for a mega telecom network that BSNL is building for the armed forces.

India doesnt need to emulate any other country: ModiModi says India doesn't need to copy other countries on the road to development
Mail Today –  Mon 22 Sep, 2014
Print
NEW DELHI: India does not need to emulate the model of any other country on the path to economic development because democracy and the entrepreneurial spirit of its 1.25 billion people are capable of driving growth at a fast pace, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said.
“India does not need to become anything else. India must become only India. This is a country that once upon a time was called ‘the golden bird’. We have fallen from where we were before. But now we have the chance to rise again,” Modi said in an interview with CNN aired on Sunday.
“If you see the details of the last five or 10 centuries, you will see that India and China have grown at similar pace. Their contributions to global GDP have risen in parallel, and fallen in parallel. Today’s era once again belongs to Asia. India and China are both growing rapidly, together. That is why India needs to remain India,” he said, responding to a question about a perception among people that India will be the next China.
Modi made it clear that India would not compromise on its legacy of democracy to achieve faster economic growth.
Asked specifically if he envied the power wielded by the Chinese government, Modi replied that a person like him may not have become the Prime Minister if there was no democracy.
“If China is one example, then democratic countries provide another example. They have also grown fast. You can’t say that growth is not possible because of democracy. Democracy is our commitment. It is our great legacy, a legacy we simply cannot compromise,” he said.
“If there were no democracy then someone like me, Modi, a child born in a poor family, how would he sit here? This is the strength of democracy.”
Modi said he had a roadmap to channel the “unlimited talent” of Indians.
“I have no doubt about our capabilities. I have a lot of faith in the entrepreneurial nature of our 1.25 billion people. There is a lot of capability,” he said.
During the interview, his first since he became the PM, Modi indicated that he believed China would not allow its territorial disputes with countries like the Philippines and Vietnam to escalate.
“Look at how it (China) has focused on economic development. It’s hardly the sign of a country that wants to be isolated. It wants to stay connected. That is why we should have trust China’s understanding and have faith that it would accept global laws and will play its role in cooperating and moving forward,” he said.
Asked if he worried about China’s behaviour towards its neighbours, Modi replied: “India is different. It is a country of 1.25 billion people. We can’t run our country if we get worried about every small thing. At the same time, we can’t close our eyes to problems.”
Responding to a query on Russia’s annexation of the Crimea, he said India’s viewpoint is that “efforts need to be made to sit together and talk, and to resolve problems in an ongoing process”.
On the issue of discrimination and violence against women, Modi said the dignity of women is a “collective responsibility” on which there could be no compromise.
“We have to revive the family culture in which a woman is respected and considered equal, her dignity encouraged. The main thing here is girl child education. By doing so, the possibility of empowerment will increase,” he said.
Asked what he did in his spare time, Modi replied: “Look, I’m not the ‘not-working’ type. I derive pleasure from my work. Work gives me relaxation too. Every moment I am thinking of something new: making a new plan, new ways to work.”

Sensex down 112 points on weak Asian cuesSensex up 116 points; consumer durables, FMCG stocks steal the show
Our Bureau/Agencies
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the green amid weak European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex rose 116.32 points or 0.43 per cent at 27,206.74 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty gained 24.85 points or 0.31 per cent at 8,146.30.
Rajesh Agarwal, Head-Research, Eastern Financiers, in a report said: "Going forward, the Sensex earnings multiple at 17 times FY15 earnings looks a bit stretched, and investors would be better off being cautious as the near term upside looks a little difficult. Some reforms have taken place but the quantum of impact on the bottom-line of corporates needs to be seen. Hot money, lower crude prices, monsoon not turning out to be as bad as was earlier expected, are some of the factors that are driving the markets. While we believe that markets could witness correction in short-term, earnings expansion, government initiatives towards infrastructure and strengthening economic data, provide comfort on the medium-term. We strongly believe that the Government’s pro-growth approach will aid the revival in the economy and would in turn boost equity markets."
Among BSE sectoral indices, consumer durables, FMCG, auto and oil & gas indices were the star-performers and were up 3.12 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.88 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, metal index fell the most by 1.22 per cent, followed by healthcare 0.89 per cent and India infrastructure 0.87 per cent.
Tata Motors, ONGC, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and SBIN were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Cipla, BHEL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Infosys.
Concerns over a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday, while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners' shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 per cent, also took its toll.
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the weekend said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 347.48 at 10:02 a.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.6 per cent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts slid 0.5 per cent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.8 per cent.

After SBI  other banks may revise deposit ratesAfter SBI, other banks may revise rates on deposits
Mail Today Bureau     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 17, 2014  | 13:25 IST
(L-R) ICICI Bank Managing Director (MD) Chanda Kochhar, PNB CMD KR Kamath, SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya at a Ficci event in Mumbai on Sept 15
State Bank of India (SBI) cut its interest rate for medium-term deposits by 0.25 per cent on Tuesday setting the stage for other banks to follow the bellwether.
"In view of abundant liquidity coupled with slower-than-anticipated credit pick-up, State Bank of India has decided to cut rates of one-to-three-year deposits by 0.25 per cent to 8.75 per cent per annum from 9 per cent," the country's largest lender said in a statement. The reduced rate will come into effect from September 18.
Given that now the liquidity situation for banks has improved substantially over the last year and credit growth is still languishing, banks may finally start to cut rates on deposits.
Punjab National Bank chairman and managing director KR Kamath said, "Liquidity has been reasonably good for our bank for some time now and corporate credit has not picked up in a big way. There is no point paying for deposits which cannot be deployed in profitable lending activities."
While banks may have enough headroom to reduce deposit rates, most of them may wait until Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy announcement by the end of this month. Kamath added, "We will hold rates probably till the credit policy is announced and then take a call. For now, we are doing away with our bulk deposit rates for one year, which was marginally higher."
SBI has also increased interest rates for shorter tenor deposits of 180-210 days by 0.25 per cent to 7.25 per cent per annum. The bank said that with inflation trending down-consumer price inflation for August eased to 7.80 per cent-the rate adjustment will continue to ensure that the depositors are compensated adequately with a positive real rate on their deposits.
The public sector bank is reported to be having liquidity in excess of Rs 50,000 crore in its vaults creating a challenge in deploying funds, a senior SBI executive said.
RBI figures show that the banking system's year-on-year increase in credit stood at 10.94 per cent for the fortnight ended August 22, which is almost on par with the 10.61 per cent observed in 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The slow off-take in credit also appears to be reflected in the industrial growth rate slowing to a four-month low of 0.5 per cent in July.
However, there are some banks who believe that it may be too early to expect a widespread rate cut and that it would depend on each banks' asset liability situation.

Govt to import 1 lakh tonnes of rice on supply crunchGovt to import 1 lakh tonnes of rice on temporarily supply crunch
Mayank Bhardwaj     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 19, 2014  | 16:50 IST

The govt is preparing to import rice for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century to supply the grain to remote and hilly north - eastern region where rail freight is being disrupted due to a track overhaul.
The country, which is the world's top rice exporter, will import more than 1,00,000 tonnes of rice from neighbouring Myanmar over the next several months, likely spread out across 10,000-30,000 tonne tenders, government officials said.
The imported rice and grain from domestic stocks will be distributed to the northeast region through Bangladesh's Ashuganj port, the officials said.
The imports and the distribution arrangement underscore the extensive challenges India faces as it tries to become a regional agricultural powerhouse. But the quantities are too small to shake up the rice market.
The nation took the crown as the world's top rice exporter in 2012, with nearly 10 million tonnes of annual overseas sales since then. It last imported rice in the early 1990s.
It is undertaking the first major overhaul of the region's rail infrastructure since the British laid tracks there nearly 100 years ago. The broadening of the railway gauge will start in October and is likely to be completed in April 2015.
Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, and parts of Assam, which normally receive their grain supplies from the northern plains, look set to be impacted the most by the work, the officials said. Rice is the staple food of the region, with consumption estimated at 80,000 tonnes a month.
Bringing in the grain via Bangladesh, which is only a few hundred kilometers from the cut-off locations, is expected to be cost effective and less susceptible to delays than hauling it by truck across more than 1,000 km (621 miles) of mountain roads from traditional supply centers.
State-run Food Corporation of India (FCI), the main grains procurement agency, uses railway wagons to supply rice and other grains to the northeastern states. But in the absence of modern broad gauge railway tracks, supplies beyond Silchar in Assam frequently get delayed and disrupted.
POT-HOLED ROADS
Dependence on the region's road network is also tricky.
Road blockades are almost a regular feature in the militancy-hit region, where a long-running ethnic insurgency often leads to strikes and protests. The condition of the roads are also far from ideal.
"There are two highways - No 54 and No 40 - but the latter is in a bad shape because of pot-holes, leaving us with only one highway. For food supplies, it is always too risky to rely only on one highway," said a government official directly involved in organising grain supplies to the region.
For a dry run, the FCI has started moving grains in ships from the eastern Kolkata port to Karimganj in Assam state. It is also testing an alternative route - shipping grains in barges to the Ashuganj port in Bangladesh for supplies to Tripura state.
Earlier this month, state-run trader MMTC floated a tender to import 10,000 tonnes of rice for delivery in Mizoram . Separately, the State Trading Corp has floated a similar tender to import 25 per cent broken rice for delivery in Manipur.
"These are exploratory tenders. Let's see what sort of response we get but we do see the need to import more than 100,000 tonnes of rice from Myanmar before the normal rail route is ready in six months' time," said a second official.

Staying bullish stance in medium-to-long term, Arvind Sanger, managing partner at Geosphere Capital Management, says announcements post recent diplomatic visits and various investment commitments made by Japan and China are definite positives, but at the end of the day market lives on “not just big picture announcements but actual numbers.
“The September quarter earnings are around the corner. And they are going to be moderately better than the June quarter but not hugely so. And therefore I think the market needs to digest how much they have moved,” Sanger said.
Meanwhile, Timothy Moe of Goldman Sachs remained overweight on India with a Nifty target of 9,000 by September 2015.

Bourses may soon issue guidance note on disclosuresStock exchanges may soon issue guidance note on disclosures
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 20, 2014  | 12:25 IST
The major stock exchanges in the country are likely to issue a detailed guidance note for companies on disclosures with the focus on clause 36 of the listing agreement.
"We are voluntarily coming out with a detailed guidance note targeting companies' compliance officers for making proper disclosures which are price sensitive," BSE GM, listing compliance, Khushro A Bulsara said in Mumbai on Friday on the sidelines of Assocham-organised CFO conclave.
"This step will help the compliance officers for better understanding on requirements of disclosures under the regulations," he said.
It had been found that non-disclosure was not always intentional but because of lack of understanding of importance of the information, Bulsara said.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was also planning to streamline the disclosure rules under clause 36 properly and for that a discussion paper had also been circulated.
Bulsara said that since the last one year the quantum of compliance had jumped but the stringent rules were coming in the way of greater compliances by companies.
He said in the recent past, the SEBI had surveyed the bourses disclosure tracking system to ensure the stock exchanges' capability to chase the companies properly in case of non-disclosure.
Meanwhile, Deepak Narang, UBI ED, said on Friday that in most cases of defaults diversion of capital and use of debt as capital were the principal reasons for financial trouble.
"These created dual leverage. In a economic down swing, this led to defaults," the banker observed.

Cong wary as NCP delays seat-sharing response in MaharashtraCEC
(CEC  held deliberations…)
NEW DELHI: Congress's alliance with NCP in Maharashtra appears headed for trouble as the Sharad Pawar- led party is yet to give a "positive response" to the former's proposal for seat-sharing for the upcoming Assembly polls.
Maharashtra Congress chief Manikrao Thakre told reporters after a meeting of the party's Central Election Committee (CEC) here that they will have to prepare for all 288 seats in the state if a response from NCP does not come within a day or two.
He said Congress was racing against time to finalise nominations for the Oct. 15 polls and that time is of the essence for tying up the seat-sharing arrangement.
The CEC today held deliberations on the selection of candidates for the 174 seats in Maharashtra which the party had contested in the last Assembly polls.
Without going into the number of seats offered by Congress to NCP, Thakre said there has been no response so far to the proposal from NCP.
The talk is that Congress has offered 126 seats to NCP which, however, is pitching for as many as 144 seats.
"If NCP remains adamant on its demand for more seats, then we will have to go it alone," he said in a reply to a query.
In the last Assembly elections, Congress had contested 174 seats while NCP had put up 114 candidates.
The remarks came as the process for the filing of nominations for the Assembly polls began today with the issuance of the election notification.
Maharashtra, which has over 8.28 crore voters, has a single-phase poll to elect its 13th Assembly.
Sept. 27 is the deadline for filing nominations. After scrutiny of papers, the last date for withdrawal of nominations is Oct. 1. Counting of votes will take place on Oct. 19. The current Assembly's term expires on Nov. 8.

By-poll results reaffirm that BJP has to rely on PM Narendra Modi's charisma in future
ET Bureau Sep 21, 2014, 07.06AM IST
(Those who know Modi can vouch…)
BV Rao & Ajay Singh
In the age of sound bites and tweets, politics has often been summed up in smart sentences to make it easy to understand. Shorn of rigorous analysis, the tendency to oversimplify politics in media often leads to wrong conclusions.
Look at the manner in which analysts have been attributing the BJP's poor show in the assembly by-elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh, to its overdose of communal polarization. Isn't this a contradiction in terms after the NDA's victory in 73 of Uttar Pradesh's 80 Lok Sabha seats was attributed to the BJP's ability to create communal divide? It is a mystery that in three months what was strength for the BJP has been turned into its Achilles' heel.
Similarly, in Rajasthan where the BJP was badly mauled merely 100-odd days after it won nearly three-fourth seats in the assembly, the results are seen as a sign of Modi's honeymoon period getting over. Is that so? Then why does the Modi-led NDA still show greater popularity in opinion polls? In rushing to jump to hasty conclusions, it is ignored that people of the state did vote overwhelmingly for BJP when Modi was the face of the campaign — and they did not back BJP when he did not campaign.
Of course, there is little doubt that the BJP has serious reason to worry about the outcome of the by-elections. But it would be naive to ascribe the defeat to the loss of Modi magic. Far from it, the by-elections have once again reaffirmed the fact that the BJP has nothing but Modi's charisma to bank upon in future. And this is certainly not a healthy sign for a party which has acquired the principal role in Indian politics.
The Worry Lines
The result has exposed fault lines within the party's organizational structure which were papered over by Modi's powerful popular appeal during the Lok Sabha election campaign. In fact, Modi had captured people's imagination not only as an able administrator and decisive leader but also as an unconventional politician devoted totally to development and welfare of the country. In the post-Atal/Advani era of the BJP, he came across as a thinking politician capable of inventing new idioms cleverly camouflaged in development rhetoric with a concealed tinge of religiosity. In popular perception, he offered a hope to an India beset by political paralysis and timid leadership.
Contrast this image of Modi with the state leaders of UP, Rajasthan, Bihar and Gujarat. The leadership there is not only unimaginative and uninspiring but also faction-ridden. In Uttar Pradesh for instance, the idea to bring Yogi Adityanath to the forefront of the BJP's campaign was guided by the sole consideration of marginalizing Rajnath Singh. And the yogi who heads the prestigious Gorakhnath Peeth genuinely believes that incendiary speeches that stoke communal troubles are the best substitute for innovative politics.
By all indications, the BJP's state unit refused to grow beyond mandir-masjid politics of the 1990s though Modi's campaign in the Lok Sabha elections transcended well beyond this theme and touched a chord with the new generation. In the country's most populous state which is run by an ineffectual government headed by Akhilesh Yadav, the BJP offered no alternative but chaos. The result was obvious.
Those who voted for Modi to bring in a "change" refused to go along with the status quoist appeal. In Gujarat, it was the first test for Modi's successor, Anandiben Patel. His largerthan-life persona carried the day for BJP for 12 years and the moment he was out of scene, a thoroughly trounced Congress made a comeback. In other words, as Modi grew in strength over the years, the state party organization came to depend more and more on him, weakening itself in the process.
As a political party, the BJP needs to reflect on the collective failure of its leadership to be imaginative and innovative. In this context, Modi acquires the status of a leader who alone symbolizes the party. Bereft of him, the party would be a rudderless ship, drifting aimlessly in the turbulent Indian politics.
  Look at Bihar!
But this worry is quite small compared to a greater cause of concern that emanates from these by-elections, particularly from Bihar. This relates to consolidation of the index of opposition unity (IOU) against the BJP across the country, wherever two or more parties are fighting it. There is no doubt that the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh would have fared badly had Mayawati and the Congress also joined the fray and divided anti-BJP votes.
Similarly, in Bihar despite the incongruity of the Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad and the Congress alliance, the BJP was evidently numerically disadvantaged and substantially lost ground. Once again, the unity of social bases of the anti-BJP parties would hold an ominous portent for the Hindutva forces. If one looks at the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has focussed its strategy to consolidate on Modi's appeal and keep its adversaries in divided camps.

BJP increasingly becoming a major player in West Bengal(BJP has seen a steady rise…)
The stories of Antara Bhattacharjee and Nurul Huda have something of the fantastic in them.
Bhattacharjee has swung from the left to the right — a former Communist Party of Indian-Marxist (CPI [M]) member she has switched sides to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Huda, a Muslim from the industrial town of Rishra, on the outskirts of Kolkata, thinks that the BJP is a "secular party" and Modi "respects" the minorities.
What was unthinkable a few years back may soon become a reality — the BJP becoming a major player in Bengal politics. The numbers tell a story: the saffron surge that swamped north India during the parliamentary elections earlier this year had also created a political ripple in West Bengal. During the 2011 assembly elections in the state, the BJP's vote share was just 4.06%; this went up to 16.84% during this year's Lok Sabha polls.
The party that won one Lok Sabha seat in 2009 managed two this year, retaining Darjeeling and grabbing Asansol, an industrial hub that had been a Left bastion for decades. Better still are the results from the recent by-elections to the state assembly.
BJP won the Basirhat (South) assembly seat and secured second position in Kolkata's Chowringhee seat. The last time BJP won an assembly seat in the state was back in 1999. That the Left influence is on the wane is brought home strikingly by the fact that the CPI (M) candidate from Chowringhee Faiz Ahmed Khan lost his deposit — a clear sign that the BJP is slowly but surely becoming a significant player in West Bengal. However, Partha Chatterjee, Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and West Bengal higher education and parliamentary affairs minister rubbishes the claim that BJP is gaining in popularity.
"The party is organizationally weak. During the last parliamentary elections it could deploy agents in only 710 booths out of the total 71,000 in the state," he says. Moreover, he sneers, the party has to "invite" leaders from Delhi to campaign for their candidates as they don't have local leaders of stature. The ongoing CBI probe in the Saradha scam has dented Mamata Banerjee's image, especially with the arrest of Rajat Majumdar, former West Bengal police chief and TMC leader.
Saffron Surge
According to sources in the BJP's West Bengal state unit the party has seen a steady rise in membership numbers over the past decade. From 46,000 registered members in 2000, the BJP's membership number now stands at 6,35,202.
One reason for the growing popularity of the BJP in Bengal, and especially in the rural areas, is the perceived protection that the saffron party can provide against the terror launched by the ruling TMC workers against those who oppose them. The use of violence to cow down the opposition has been a political reality in West Bengal for decades. The Marxists did it when they ruled the state from 1977 to 2011. And after May 2011 when Mamata Banerjee became the chief minister her party cadres followed the political template.
  According to Biman Bose, CPI (M) politburo member and state party secretary, between May 14, 2011 and July 31 this year, 159 CPI (M) and Left party workers were killed in West Bengal. Altogether 9,341 CPI (M) workers were injured after they were attacked by the ruling party activists.
More than 49,000 CPI (M) workers have been forced out of their homes. CPI (M) leaders allege that some antisocials backed by the ruling party had extorted nearly Rs 30 crore from CPI (M) workers and their family members for allowing them to stay in their homes. Antara Bhattacharjee is one of the victims of TMC terror raj.
Back in May 2013, TMC workers allegedly ransacked the house of Bhattacharjee and beat up her 75-year-old uncle. Says Bhattacharjee, a former sabhadhipati of West Midnapore zilla parishad and CPI (M) activist: "Even with our political connections we were intimidated by the ruling party workers."
According to Bhattacharjee, goons allegedly backed by the TMC regularly threw crude bombs at her home in Raghunathchowk village in West Midnapore's Pingla block. "I am not an ordinary woman and was an active CPI (M) worker. I ran the zilla parishad for five years before my party lost to Trinamool in 2013. I used to enjoy the status of a minister of state while running the zilla parishad. If I had to undergo such a fierce attack, the plight of ordinary CPI (M) workers can easily be imagined," she says.
And then came her decision to join the BJP. "The CPI (M) leadership is incapable of protecting its workers in rural Bengal.
The BJP is running the government in Delhi and activists of different political parties who are facing attacks by the ruling party, will automatically seek shelter under the BJP's umbrella," says Bhattacharjee.
Putting up a Fight

View: Modi smart man  has done a great job on economyeconomy
(Kiyosaki is an American…)
BANGALORE: Robert Kiyosaki , American investor and celebrity author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' series of books, today said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a smart man but has a stupendous job to bring Indian economy on track as he could upset a lot of people with his innovative ideas.
"He (Modi) is a very smart man but he has got a tough job (to bring back the Indian economy on track). I mean I would never want to be in his job. So, I am glad I am not there ... I never know. His innovative ideas are going to upset a lot of people, because everytime you bring some change, people will come after you," he told PTI here.
Kiyosaki is an American investor, businessman, self-help author, motivational speaker, financial literacy activist and financial commentator. He has written over 15 books which have combined sales of over 26 million copies.
Kiyosaki, also the Founder of the Rich Dad Company and Cashflow Technologies Inc, said Modi should look at giving right kind of financial education to school children, instead of teachers who do not have any knowledge of money.
"He (Modi) got to look at financial education. What is being taught. The problem with school teachers, you know, they are no rich people. So if a poor person teaches financial education, he will confuse students," he said.
"So if I was Mr Modi I would be looking for real entrepreneurs who are real teachers. Who really know what they are talking about. Who practice what they teach every single day," he said.
Kiyosaki also operates various investments and external business ventures, most of which are concentrated in the publishing, retail, education, mining, energy, financial market, and real estate industries.
He said he would have a channel especially for the best teachers in entrepreneurship, finance and investing, who are not part of the major corporation, as every major corporation has an agenda.
"And I would stay away from the stock market because as you know it is rigged, big time," Kiyosaki said.
Asked about the mantra for becoming rich, Kiyosaki who has a networth of USD 80 million said he uses debt to become rich, not savings.
"It is Ying and Yang. The savings is Ying and Yang is debt. Ying cannot have savings without debt. So the poor people and the middleclass are using savings, and richer using debt. I use debt to get rich - in colloquial English it is called OPM - Other People's Money," he said.
Asked why people remain poor, Kiyosaki said, "because they work for money. The rich don't work for money. If you can understand that you can understand why those people are poor... I don't save money, I use debt".
Kiyosaki, who owns oil drilling operations and oil wells around the United States, said former US President John F Kennedy, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King were great leaders because they were spiritual.
"Kennedy, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King were great leaders because they were spiritual. Spiritual people inspires, a non-spiritual man intimidates," Kiyosaki said.
Moreover, Kiyosaki said he did not like Barack Obama, George Bush, Ronal Reagan and Jimmy Carter. "I don't like Obama's politics. He does not inspire people. I didnt like Bush either. I didn'r care for Ronald Reagan. I didn't care for Jimmy Carter. I didn't care for most of them," he said.

WASHINGTON: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to the US, two influential American Senators have said the US-India relationship remains one of the most important partnerships in the world and there is an opportunity to continue making progress that will benefit both the nations.
"As the world's two largest democracies, the US-India relationship remains one of the most important partnerships in the world. We warmly welcome Prime Minister Modi to the United States and are hopeful we can work together to grow our relationship and identify areas we can strengthen in the years to come," Senator John Cornyn said.
"As the co-founder and co-chair of the Senate India Caucus, I look forward to continuing to help the US-India partnership reach its full potential," Cornyn said in a joint statement issued along with Senator Mark Warner .
Both are co-chairs of the Senate India Caucus, the only country specific caucus in the US Senate .
"We have already seen progress in the relationship in the first 100 days of Prime Minister Modi's administration, and I believe there is an opportunity to continue making progress that will benefit both of our countries," said Senator Warner, who published a 'First 100-Days' plan that outlined 12 recommendations for action, seven of which have already been adopted by both governments.
"From energy, to defense, to counterterrorism, to trade, the United States and India have many overlapping national interests. As our trade relationship continues to grow, increasing export opportunities to India will create more jobs for Americans back here at home," Warner said.
Early this week, the two Senators introduced a resolution that designates September 30, 2014 as US-India Partnership Day. The resolution was unanimously passed by the Senate.
US-India Partnership Day coincides with Modi's visit to the White House , highlighting the bilateral commitment to furthering the relationship between the two countries.

Uddhav Thackeray s final offer: 151 for Sena  119 for BJPBJP
(Shiv Sena today made…)
MUMBAI: Beyond the alliance arithmetic, there seems to be little chemistry left between Shiv Sena and BJP leaders. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday while publicly making a "final offer" of just 119 seats to BJP chose the occasion to complain about lack of consultation during the distribution of portfolios and formation of the Central government four months ago.
Soon after Uddhav's speech, the state BJP leadership rejected the offer. Eknath Khadse and Vinod Tawde, the Oppositon leaders in the assembly and the legislative council, held a press conference in Delhi on Sunday to announce that the party has refused to accept this proposal. "There is no final offer when talks are going on," said Tawde, angry over Uddhav going public with the offer.
Earlier in the day, Uddhav also talked about his father Bal Thackeray's role in saving Narendra Modi at the hour of his worst crisis in 2002. Terming this political crisis the biggest test of his life, an emotionally charged Uddhav directed his ire at Modi seeking to draw him into the seat-sharing deadlock with references to past PMs, BJP old guard's relationship with the Thackerays and the medieval dominance of Delhi, which the Maratha empire resisted.
So far, Modi had kept himself out of the negotiations and this seemed to have irked Uddhav. "The BJP must not forget that when the whole world was out to oust Narendra Modi as Gujarat CM, it was my father who told LK Advani that Modi must stay. We have had a long association with the BJP. But the new leadership of the party seems to be taking us for granted. This is not acceptable to us," Uddhav told his party men at Bandra in Mumbai.
Speaking to cheering Shiv Sainiks, Uddhav said, "it is really unfortunate that instead of launching the campaign we are right now haggling over seat-sharing. The first proposal that came to us was of 135 seats each for Sena and BJP. They said they had decided the formula. But how could they do that without taking us along. Then they told me we are willing to give some more seats, I told them that they had no right to give. Those were our seats and we would decide whether to give them away. In LS polls, the BJP fought one more seat and we did not complain about the portfolios later. Now how can we accept everything that they decide".
The Rang Sharada auditorium had an electrifying atmosphere with Sainiks mobbing the state, chanting slogans. Uddhav reminded his party men that this was the place where Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray announced many major political decisions.
"I am doing this for the Shiv Sainiks. On every seat there are 15 to 20 aspirants. How can we give away our quota to others. I do not care if the alliance stays or not. We are from the land of Chhtrapati Shivaji who challenged the domination of Delhi," Uddhav said.
Taking a dig at PM Modi during his speech Uddhav said "Does anybody here remember the full name of PM Deve Gowda? Those occupying the PM's post must not forget their past. A tea vendor can become PM. We too have aspirations. Senior BJP leaders like Vajpayee and Advani used to be respectful to Balasaheb Thackeray but the new leadership of the BJP is taking Shiv Sena for granted."

Customised Android tablets make way to India at Rs 5,000 onwards

New Delhi: Challenging the one-size-fits-all approach of leading electronics manufacturers, a home-grown company has brought in a new concept of customised tablets for specific segments like children, women, seniors, professionals and gamers with prices starting at under Rs 5,000.
Besides being customised at the hardware and software levels, these tablets - under the brand name 'Pinig Tabs' and powered by Android operating system - would provide 'managed device' services to users through the product's lifecycle.
The company, Pinig Tech, has categorised its tablets as Executive Tab, Kids Tab, Woman Tab, Gaming Tab and Senior Tab for different user groups. The tablets would start at a price of under Rs 5,000 and can go up to Rs 12,800 depending on the configuration that a user requires.
Pinig Tech has categorised its tablets as Executive Tab, Kids Tab, Woman Tab, Gaming Tab and Senior Tab for different user groups.

"We are passionate about technology and want to make it easy to use for everybody. You shouldn't have to be tech-savvy to enjoy all the benefits of technology. While your 8-month old child can use the Kids Tab for learning numbers and rhymes, your 70-year old dad can use the Senior Tab to watch his grandchildren learn their first words," Pinig Tech's co-founder Piyush Nigam said.
These tablets would come with a range of apps selected on the basis of the needs of the target user, while ensuring compatibility with a particular device's configuration.
The company said that Pinig Tab would be a 'managed device', which means that it automatically upgrades chosen apps as and when a new version of the app is released.
The company has also lined up big plans for the upcoming festive season, while it is also in talks with leading e-commerce sites for exclusive associations.
Besides, Pinig aims to tap social media platforms and schools to promote these tabs.
Apart from discounts, Pinig would be offering festive packs that include branded tablet covers, earphones, 3G dongle and other accessories.
Rise of smartphones with large screen has eaten into the global tablet and 2-in-1 market with shipment growing just 3.9 per cent to 50.4 million units in the January-March quarter, research firm IDC said. Slow growth across commercial and consumer segments saw sales of players like Apple, Asus and Amazon also falling.
However, customised tablets are becoming popular in developed countries with many players offering products tailor-made for specific customer groups.
Mayank Saxena from the Online Marketing Team at Pinig Tech said customers can get life-time service on these tabs through its website pinig.com and also select different apps.
"Moreover, we are in the process of contacting schools for our Kids Tab," said Manjeet Singh from the Product Development Team. The Kids Tab is available in three age categories, ranging from toddlers to pre-teens.
"We have big plans for this year's festive season. We are in talks with leading e-commerce sites for exclusive associations for Diwali and beyond. With social media gaining popularity, we also plan to issue coupon codes for our tablets.
"Apart from discounts on the tablets, we would be offering festive packs that include accessories that a user may need.
"These become attractive gifting options, particularly because the range of offering has wide appeal across age groups, while representing an exciting alternative to traditional gifts," said Vikrant Sharma from the Business Development Team.

AIBOC asks banks to recover NPAs from corporate housesAIBOC asks banks to recover NPAs from corporate houses
Our Bureau
Tweet
Mangalore, September 21:  
The All-India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) has urged the banking industry to adopt stronger measures to recover NPAs (non-performing assets) from corporate houses.
Addressing the members of Corporation Bank Officers’ Organisation (CBOO) in Mangalore, Y Sudarshan, President of AIBOC, said some corporate houses were evading the recovery process through their influence in political circles.
The recent setback in the performance of some banks was due to the huge corporate loans that have become NPAs. He stressed the need for support from the government and the RBI in enforcing the security that are available for realisation of dues from corporate houses.
Wage revision
On the wage revision in banking industry, he said the rank and file in the banking sector have been waiting for the conclusion of 10th bipartite for last two years. The Indian Banks Association has not been able to come with a reasonable offer. The settlement would be elusive unless there is a reasonable, fair and equitable compensation revision for the officers’ fraternity, he said.
On the security of workforce, he said AIBOC has sought the intervention of the Centre for extending safety and security to those working in difficult centres. The recent incidents of kidnapping of some innocent people by militants in the North East have created a fear psychosis among the workforce, he said.
DN Prakash, President of CBOO, was present on the occasion.

Fast-forward Modi govt leaves bureaucracy huffing & puffingFast-forward Modi govt leaves bureaucracy huffing & puffing
Vrishti Beniwal | New Delhi Sep 22, 2014 12:57 AM IST
"I do not handle these issues; I cannot be doing their work every time," yells a bureaucrat, returning a file that landed on his table after being shuttled from one desk to another in his ministry. He had once in the past agreed to work on a similar issue to help a colleague but not any more. His equation with that colleague has not changed. What has is the government at the Centre, and with that, the work load.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to speed the government's decision-making process have begun to show - at least as strains on bureaucrats' brows. True, they are not scared of taking bona fide decisions any more. But many are finding it difficult to keep pace with Modi's working style - from long work hours to faster clearance of files, it is a telling tale in the corridors of power.
As the orders from the top now require ministries to move Cabinet notes faster, nodal ministries give little time for inter-ministerial consultation. So, deadline pressures affect the quality of notes as well. In fact, on receiving some below-standard ones, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth recently wrote to ministries to ensure these were free of defects.
"The nodal ministry sometimes asks for a file in two hours. How is one to analyse a proposal from every angle in such a small time? You have to look at it from various standpoints - financial implication, technical specifications, better ways of doing it," rues an official, struggling to explain his side of the story to this reporter, even as he juggles with incessant phone calls.
According to guidelines, government departments are required to send comments to their administrative ministries within 15 days of receiving a draft Cabinet note. This time is necessary, given that the note has to move from the under secretary to director, joint secretary, additional secretary and then the secretary, with each giving his or her comments.
"Besides routine files, I have cleared 48 Cabinet notes in the past three months. That would mean about two days for one note," says the official quoted above, stealing a glance at another proposal that has just landed on his table, again with a short clearance deadline.
As many ministers and senior bureaucrats try to impress the prime minister with their ability to move things quickly, they sometimes build pressure on others by dropping names. Lines like 'the PMO is asking for it' or 'the Cabinet secretary wants it early' are used whenever needed. "Since you cannot short-circuit the procedure, the quality is bound to suffer," says another official.
In many cases, say officials, the notes are for small proposals, of little consequence to the economy but helping some people prove themselves before their bosses. Some of the Cabinet notes are of more than 30 pages. What do over-burdened bureaucrats do in such a situation?
"In such a scenario, I will have no option but to scuttle the proposal, else there is one Mr Ranjit Sinha (CBI director) who might come after me. On some occasions I stood up and said it would take at least four days," says the first official.
The problem gets magnified as some departments are under-staffed and proper infrastructure is not in place. Most section officers and under secretaries share office space and peripherals like printers. Even the officers of the director rank are often seen haggling with their administrative departments to provide them with a car for an official meeting outside.
"Saying it is one thing and doing is another. You need to put an enabling ecosystem and take concrete actions," suggests a director with a key economic ministry.
However, not everyone is complaining. Some bureaucrats, particularly those higher in ranks, feel more empowered now. So, they are embracing the change.
"You have to keep three important things in mind - do it quickly, do not make mistakes, and make it presentable. The key lies in how you strike the right balance. These are the things we were taught in the Indian Administrative Service training academy. But these are being reiterated only now," says an official of the additional secretary rank. This official agrees that the new prime minister is focusing on bureaucratic reforms, but adds it might be a while before a section of the civil service catches up with the speed.
THE COST OF SPEED
Panting to keep pace: Bureaucrats are finding it difficult to keep pace with Modi's working style - long work hours, faster file clearance, among other things
 
Lack of consultation: As the orders from the top now require ministries to move Cabinet notes faster, nodal ministries are hardly giving any time for inter-ministerial consultation. Naturally, deadline pressures are affecting the quality of notes
 
What the guidelines say: Govt departments are required to send their comments to the ministries concerned within 15 days of receiving a draft Cabinet note. This is required as the note has to move from the under secretary to director, joint secretary, additional secretary and then secretary, with each giving his or her comments
 
Wasted labour?
Officials say in many cases the notes are for small proposals that are not going to have a great impact on the economy but help some people prove themselves before their bosses

Foreign investors lap up long-term govt bondseconomy
(Buoyed by the faith in the…)
Mumbai: Foreign institutional investors, or FIIs, have stepped up investments in long-term government bonds with maturities extending up to 28-30 years, marking a shift from their practice of betting mainly on Indian sovereign debt instruments maturing within five years and signalling restoration of global faith in the Indian economy .
FIIs have already exhausted nearly 65% of the $5-billion investment limit for long-term investors such as foreign central banks, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowment funds and insurance funds, data from the National Securities Depository (NSDL) shows.
About 44% of the limit was reached by July 24, when the government halved it from the $10 billion set earlier as it had remained largely unutilised. The balance $5 billion was added to the regular category where demand was very high among FIIs investing in Indian government securities with maturities of more than three years As of September 19, FIIs have utilised nearly 99% of the limit in the regular category.
Some foreign central banks from Southeast Asian and European countries have been seen increasing their investments in India, with lot sizes of Rs 200-500 crore each per day under the long-term category. The central bank of Norway, Norges Bank, is among the foreign investors that have been putting money into India of late, four people familiar with the matter told ET.
Norges Bank Investment Management is among the largest debt market investors across the world. It had forex reserves of 3,663 billion Norwegian Krone (NOK) (about Rs 3,506 crore) at the end of the quarter to June. An email sent to Norges did not elicit any response. A big Canada-based pension fund is also lapping up Indian government bonds with long-term maturities, ranging from five to 30 years. "Given the high differential between India and global rates, and the improved India macro, funds continue to invest in Indian debt," said Ananth Narayan, regional head of financial markets-South Asia at Standard Chartered Bank.
In the US, overnight rates are being quoted at 0-0.25%, while in India the prevailing rate is 8%, the repo rate at which banks borrow overnight funds from the Reserve Bank of India. The ten-year bond yield is trading at about 2.55%, compared with 8.50% for the ten-year benchmark India bond.
Among emerging economies, 600-800 basis points' spread or gap would be the most attractive for global investors, dealers said. A basis point is 0.01%. Long-term overseas investors have started investing more in India, said Badrish Kolhalli, fund manager-fixed income at HDFC Life Insurance. "Overseas investors are gaining confidence from the RBI and government's efforts to bring down inflation and fiscal deficit.
This has enhanced India's long-term outlook with a stable government at the Centre," he saidFiscal deficit or the excess government expenditure over revenues is targeted at 4.1% of gross domestic product in 2014-15 and the government looks committed to achieve it. Similarly, RBI aims to contain retail inflation at 6% by January 2016. "Inflation is coming down. This is consistent with our forecast.
Macro indicators are improving," RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said last week. The relatively stable rupee has also helped attract more flows into Indian debt markets.
"Given consensus expectation of only mild rupee depreciation, much of these debt investments are likely open, without any forex hedges," said Narayan. "On the regular FII/ FPI (foreign portfolio investors), where government limits are practically filled, we are seeing enquiries for corporate debt investments." Last month, foreign fund Franklin Templeton had bought bonds worth about Rs 16,000 crore in the largest single-day purchase of Indian government securities. "Those fund houses do not borrow money to invest. They do it out of their reserves and regular inflows. This is a case of carry trade, which is attractive compared to that of other countries like Japan or the US," said a senior executive from a primary dealership that actively trades in government bonds.

ET Wealth: Why you should by ULIPs 2.0Allianz
(While the low charges of…)
They were once the most bought financial product. Then Ulips became the most reviled investment, forcing a string of reformatory measures. Now these investment-cum-insurance plans have changed once again to become a low-cost investment option. In fact, some of the Ulips introduced in recent months are cheaper than the direct plans of mutual funds.
We won't be surprised if this evokes an angry response from readers. Ulip became a four-letter word due to the high charges levied by insurance companies and rampant mis-selling by distributors. In some cases, the charges were as high as 80% of the premium in the first year. Distributors lured gullible investors by not revealing the high charges and showcasing only the returns offered by the market-linked product.
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) clamped down in 2010, capping the annualised charges of Ulips at 2.25% for the first 10 years of holding. The charges were fixed at this rate because it was the average cost charged by competing products such as mutual funds. With no incentive left for distributors, Ulip sales plunged after the Irda guidelines came into effect. Though Ulips had become a very cost-effective investment, nobody was buying them because nobody was selling them.
In recent months, insurance companies have sweetened the deal for investors by reducing the charges even further. The Bajaj Allianz Future Gain plan does not levy premium allocation charges if the annual investment is Rs 2 lakh and above. The Edelweiss Tokio Wealth Accumulation Plan doesn't have policy administration charges. Some Ulips, such as Aviva i-Growth and ICICI Prudential Elite Life II, don't have lower charges but compensate long-term investors with 'loyalty additions'. "The plan works out cheaper because we return the money to the long-term investors," says Rishi Piparaiya, director, marketing & direct sales, Aviva Life Insurance.
But the Click2invest plan from HDFC Life is a game changer for the segment. The only charge it levies is an annual fund management fee of 1.35% of the corpus value. There is also a mortality charge but that is for the life cover offered to the policyholder. The low charges make the Click2invest plan cheaper than even the direct plan of a diversified equity fund. For instance, the direct plan of the largest equity scheme, HDFC Equity Fund, charges an expense ratio of 1.5% per year. "The Click2invest plan is costefficient and, therefore, comparable with the direct plans of mutual funds," says Sanjay Tripathy, senior EVP, marketing and product, HDFC Life (Click here for interview) .
Some readers may pooh-pooh the idea of saving a sliver on costs. After all, a 0.15% saving on costs makes a difference of only Rs 150 on an investment of Rs 1 lakh. While this may seem small, the difference in the cost can balloon into substantial savings in the long term (see graphic). As the graphic shows, the difference in the corpus value of various levels of returns is not very substantial in the initial years, but in 30 years, even a 0.5% difference in returns will widen the gap between 9.5% returns and 9% by Rs 15.4 lakh.
  Shed your aversion to Ulips
This transformation of Ulips from a costly bundled product to a low-cost option has led to a change of heart among financial planners as well. For long, they have advised clients to keep insurance and investment separate. "We used to advise against mixing insurance and investment because of the high costs of Ulips. A combination of mutual funds for investment and term plans for life insurance worked out to be cheaper," says S Sridharan, head of financial planning, FundsIndia.com. "However, low-cost products like this will be suitable for investors who want to combine insurance with investments," he adds.
He's not alone. With more low-cost Ulips on the anvil (at least two companies are awaiting Irda's approval for their low-cost Ulips), many financial planners are changing their tune. "The Click2invest plan from HDFC Life is a good product. We are recommending it to our clients," says Jaya Nagarmat from Investor Shoppe. Tanvir Alam, founder & CEO of Fincart goes a step further. "This Ulip will give the mutual fund industry a run for its money," he says.

As many as eight Indian women, led by ICICI Bank  chief Chanda Kochhar, have made it to the Fortune list of 25 most powerful women "shaping the new world order" in the Asia-Pacific region.
Ms Kochhar, placed highest among Indian women in the list, has been ranked second across the region, while three others - State Bank of India 's Arundhati Bhattacharya (4th), HPCL 's Nishi Vasudeva (5th) and Axis Bank 's Shikha Sharma (10th) - have also made it to the top 10.
The list is topped by Australian banking major Westpac's chief Gail Kelly.
Other Indians on the top 25 list include Biocon  chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw (19th), National Stock Exchange (NSE) CEO Chitra Ramkrishna (22nd), HSBC's Naina Lal Kidwai (23rd) and TAFE chairman and CEO Mallika Srinivasan (25th).
Releasing the latest rankings, the magazine said that women around the world are continuing to win the top jobs, so much so that more than a third of the women on this Asia-Pacific list are making their debut in the coveted list, including two from India.
The two Indian new entrants are Ms Bhattacharya and Ms Vasudeva.
"More and more businesswomen are taking tougher jobs and helming bigger firms. More than a third of the women on our Asia-Pacific list are making their MPW (most powerful women) debut," Fortune said.
Among Indians, SBI chairperson Adundhati Bhattacharya, ranked second after Ms Kochhar in the list, is the first woman to hold the three-year post at the country's largest bank and oversees a 208-year-old institution with $400 billion in assets and 218,000 employees dispersed among 16,000 branches across India.
On the other hand, Ms Vasudeva, 58, became the first woman to head an Indian oil company and is "and one of only four women to helm a Global Fortune 500 firm in the Asia-Pacific region".
Ms Ramakrishna is the only woman on the list heading a stock exchange.
Meanwhile, PepsiCo's India-born CEO, Indra Nooyi, has been ranked third among the world's most powerful business women by Fortune. She is only Indian-origin woman on this year's global list, which has been topped by IBM chairman and CEO Ginni Rometty and General Motors CEO Mary Barra.

Maharashtra polls: NCP to meet today as deadlock over seat sharing with Congress continues1

Mumbai: The Nationalist Congress Party's core committee will meet on Monday as its seat sharing deadlock with the Congress for the Maharashtra Assembly elections continues. The Congress has refused to toe NCP's ultimatum saying it can give only 124 seats to the NCP instead of the 144 demanded by the party.
The Congress and the NCP have both threatened to fight the elections alone. Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan had snubbed NCP over an "ultimatum" given by party leader Praful Patel on its demand to contest 144 seats in the October 15 Assembly elections, saying that such discussions are not held through press conferences.
"Such discussions are not held through press conferences. Talks are on between the two parties," Chavan told reporters on the sidelines of a function in Navi Mumbai near here. Addressing a press conference here yesterday, Patel told Congress to revert on the issue of seat-sharing and said that his party will "wait a day longer". Against the backdrop of stalemate in the Congress-NCP camp over the seat-sharing formula, Chavan said that Congress will declare its first list of candidates on Monday.
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #congress #nationalist congress party #ncp
"A first list of the candidates would be declared on Monday. None of the alliances have taken shape as of yet and list of candidates has also to be declared. Only a few days are left now," Chavan said. Taking a swipe at his detractors, Chavan said, "Congress is facing the election under my leadership as the Congress high command has reposed faith in me."

PNB opts for 5:1 stock split  fund raising; stock ralliesPNB opts for 5:1 stock split, fund raising; stock rallies
R Yegya Narayanan
Tweet
Coimbatore, Sept 22:  
The stock split fever seems to be catching up among the banks, both public and private, with Punjab National Bank (PNB) becoming the latest bank to go for a 5:1 stock split.
The bank has also decided to raise funds to meet Basel III guidelines and to meet its business needs through QIP/FPO/rights issue route.
In its filings with the stock exchanges, Punjab National Bank said that its board of directors had on September 19 gave in-principle approval to split the face value of its shares from Rs 10 into five shares of Rs 2 each (five shares for every one held).
PNB has become the sixth bank in recent months to go for a stock split to increase liquidity and to make the stock more affordable. Already, Axis Bank has split the face value of its shares from Rs 10 to Rs 2 and Jammu & Kashmir Bank had opted for a 10:1 split that has also been implemented.
Three other banks have announced 5:1 stock split in recent weeks - Corporation Bank, Canara Bank and ICICI Bank but the formalities for that are to be gone through and the record date is yet to be notified. PNB becomes the sixth bank to take recourse to stock split in recent weeks.
While the value of the stocks of Axis Bank and J&K Bank (pre-split) were high and ICICI Bank and PNB stocks are trading at high value, Corporation Bank and Canara Bank shares are trading at sub-Rs 400 levels even before the split.
PNB board also discussed the ways of raising capital to meet Basel-Ill guidelines and to finance its business requirements and opted to explore the possibility of raising capital through QIP/FPO/rights issue.
However, the exchange notification did not indicate any specific time-frame.
The shares of PNB are up by Rs 9.15 to Rs 986 on the BSE minutes after trading began.

("Trend in investment activity…)
MUMBAI: The S&P BSE Sensex slipped as much as 172 points in trade on Monday, led by losses in capital goods, metals and banks following weakness in the global markets.
"After taking a breather last week, the indices may continue to remain subdued at start this week," said IIFL report.
"Trend in investment activity of FIIs and movement in global markets will determine the near term trend on the domestic bourses. Global cues are also mostly lower. Despite the hyped listing of Alibaba, US indices fell on weakness in Oracle and Yahoo ," the report added.
At 09:17 a.m.; the 30-share index was at 26,939.51, down 150.91 points or 0.56 per cent. It touched a high of 27,010.22 and a low of 26,924.30 in early trade.
The Nifty was at 8,071.05, down 50.40 points or 0.62 per cent. It touched a high of 8,086.95 and a low of 8,069.35 in early trade.
"The Nifty has given a sharp pull back rally of almost 8.49 percent. Now it is likely to face a stiff resistance in 8,150-8,220 band. If Nifty breaches this level, it may further go up to 8,350 in the extreme short term. However, a breach of 7,900 is likely to take Nifty lower to 7,800 and then 7,650 in the near future. We recommend holding long positions with stop loss of 7,900," said Microsec report.
"For the coming week, first support of Nifty is at 8,010 and the resistance is 8,150. If Nifty breaks 8,010, it may further go down to 7,950 and then 7,900. However, if Nifty is able to sustain above 8,150, the level of 8,190-8,220 would become the next target," the report added.
The S&P BSE Midcap Index was down 0.36 per cent and the S&P BSE Smallcap Index slipped 0.05 per cent.
Among the sectoral indices, the S&P BSE Capital goods Index fell 1.06 per cent, the S&P BSE Metal Index fell 0.72 per cent and the S&P BSE Bankex was down 0.65 per cent.

NEW DELHI: Bharti Infratel Ltd slipped upto 5 per cent in trade on Monday, after the US private equity fund Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. (KKR) is set to launch a share sale that could raise about $230 million as it exits Bharti Infratel six years after investing, taking advantage of a sharp rebound in the valuations of the telecom tower company.

"The intention is to launch it (the share sale) this week, but depends on a lot of variables, so it's not set in stone."
Bharti Infratel is run by India's largest phone company by revenue, Bharti Airtel. KKR and Bharti Infratel declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, UBS and Citigroup didn't respond to calls.
KKR owns 4.5 crore shares , or 2.38%, of Bharti Infratel, which has more than 36,000 telecom towers of its own. In addition, Bharti Infratel has a 42% holding in Indus Towers , the country's largest telecom tower company that's owned jointly by Vodafone India , Idea and Bharti Airtel , said the ET report.
Since its IPO price of Rs220 in December 2012, Bharti Infratel's stock plunged to an all-time low of Rs148 in June 2013, mirroring the troubles in the telecom industry, and consequently the tower companies.

Maharashtra polls: Shiv Sena makes offer of 119 seats  BJP adamant on 130  alliance in trouble35

Mumbai: The deadlock between Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party over seat sharing for Maharashtra Assembly elections continues even as the former has made a new offer of 119 seats to the latter. But the BJP wants 130 seats and the party was even ready to fight the polls alone if no consensus is reached, said sources.
The 25-year-old alliance is now on the verge of collapse as both the parties have refused to bow down and have also warned of fighting polls alone.
Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said, "They should remember they are not givers but takers on this land. I will be saddened if the alliance breaks."
The 25-year-old alliance is now on the verge of collapse as both the parties have refused to bow down and have also warned of fighting polls alone.
Even a series of proposals from both sides could not manage to end the stalemate. On SUnday, Shiv Sena has given a final proposal, what they called a last ditch effort to pull a face saver.
Thackeray said, "We can give BJP 119 seats and 18 seats to the other parties."
But the BJP was not buying Sena's latest offer either. Sources told CNN-IBN that the party's Central Election Committee said they were ready to fight the polls alone, if need be.
BJP leader Eknath Khadse said, "We are not happy with the offer given to us by Shiv Sena. If we accept the proposal, we will be contesting lesser than last assembly elections."
The BJP has demanded around 130 seats and wanted Sena to contest on 140 seats. But Sena has made it clear that it would contest on at least 150 seats and has also communicated that the BJP could not widen its base at Sena's cost. The BJP insisted that they want Sena to discuss on 59 seats that it has never won.
As the BJP gets into a huddle to solve it's biggest crisis in Maharashtra, Thackeray has sent across two messages - Sena was not the one that was breaking the alliance and they were fully prepared to contest alone, if need be. As both the parties are in

Chinese authorities have arrested six employees of a Shanghai food supplier to McDonald’s and other major restaurant chains in China after revelations of meat safety violations, the supplier said Friday. ( Robert Channick )
 Most Shanghai Husi workers had been on paid leave since July 21, when issues such as mixing expired meat and picking up products off the floor were exposed on Chinese television. The plant had been a major provider to McDonald's locations in Asia and to other major fast-food chains. 
 "It was our expectation that they could resume their work as soon as possible," OSI Group said in a statement. "Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond our control, this will not be the case."
OSI's meat producing plant in Shanghai was shut down in July over the safety allegations. Chinese police arrested six OSI employees this month in connection with the issue, which earlier prompted Oak Brook-based McDonald's to end supply contracts with OSI in China.

OSI Group on Sept. 2 handed control of a plant in Guangzhou, a city near Hong Kong in southeastern China, indefinitely to a subsidiary of competitor Golden State Foods Corp.
The food safety issue has been a blow to both OSI Group and McDonald’s, which saw its Asia sales fall sharply in July. OSI Group, through its subsidiaries, supplies products to McDonald’s, Yum Brands Inc.'s KFC and other major restaurant chains in China.
OSI Group established its first food processing plant in China in 1991 and began supplying products to McDonald’s the following year. The Shanghai plant opened in 1996.
The scandal, which spread as far as Hong Kong and Japan, sparked a Chinese probe into the firm and dragged down China sales at Yum and McDonald's, which have both since cut or suspended ties with OSI.
"Over the past two months, Shanghai Husi has experienced significant financial and customer losses and the authorities' investigations are still ongoing. It is very unlikely that production will be resumed soon," OSI said in the statement.
It added that a small of number of Shanghai Husi staff would be kept on to assist with the ongoing investigation.
"As such, Shanghai Husi cannot be fully shut down at this stage," the firm added.

Telecom industry relieved over HC ruling on mobile towersTelecom industry relieved over Gujarat HC ruling on mobile towers
Aparajita Gupta     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 22, 2014  | 12:01 IST

The latest verdict of the Gujarat High Court that base stations for wireless data and mobile communications pose no threat to health if prescribed norms are followed will have far-reaching impact on erasing people's fears, say industry experts.
The 25-page order of a Gujarat High Court bench of Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice JB Pardiwala said authorities concerned must also educate people that they had no reason to fear for their health due to radio frequency emissions from these base stations in their vicinity.
The order came in the light of a civil appeal by some residents of an Ahmedabad neighbourhood wanting a direction to the authorities to disallow Reliance Jio Infocomm, which is seeking to extend pan-India 4G services, from using a mobile base station in their neighbourhood.
Reacting to the verdict, KS Parthasarathy, former secretary in the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, said the confusion has been created by some companies that are indulging in false propaganda "that mobile tower radiation is bad".
"In the majority of the cases, the radiation levels are within specified limits. It is so low it hardly has an impact. In India, the specified limit is one-tenth the global norms - 90 per cent of the countries follow the international limit," Parthasarathy told IANS.
He said some mischief-mongers were showing morphed and scary pictures of the ill-effects of mobile tower emissions. That's why the court verdict was a step in the right direction.
"This is a good decision," he said on the court wanting the authorities to propagate the correct scenario through various media.
The petitioners feared that since the base station in question was just outside the garden of their residential premises, they would be exposed to constant radiation, which could cause severe health hazards - a premise that was dismissed by the court.
The central government, another respondent, told the court that the fear was baseless. Similar suits were filed in the past and the court decisions have also been similar - but for cases where the norms were flouted.
The government said this was also the conclusion of the World Health Organisation (WHO), which was communicated through Fact Sheet No. 304 of May 2006 on electromagnetic fields and public health.
The court ruled: "Considering the very low exposure levels and the research-results collected to date, there is no convincing scientific evidence that weak RF signals from base stations and wireless networks cause adverse health effects."
In any case, the court said, there are now strict regulations for companies to follow.
"We are gratified that the Gujarat High Court has recognised the safety measures of the Government of India. It is one of the best in the world. Citizens can feel safe," said Rajan S. Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators' Association of India.
"The court has also recognized the need for the authorities to do more to make the public aware of safety measures and help remove their fears. Our association is actively working on this initiative," Mathews told IANS. "We believe addressing these concerns will be key to meeting the government's objective of broadband-on-demand for all citizens of India."

Agencies | Posted: September 22, 2014 10:22 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 4:39 pm
After slipping below 27K level in early trades, the benchmark Sensex today recovered smartly to end with a gain of over 116 points at 27,206.74 on good buying in bluechips including ITC, Tata Motors and ONGC even as global cues remained weak.
After a lower start at 27,008.12, the Sensex dipped below the 27,000-mark to touch a low of 26,918.93, down over 170 points. Buying after mid-session, however, lifted the BSE index to settle at 27,206.74, logging a gain of 116.32 points, or 0.43 per cent.
On Friday, the index had fallen 21.79 points, snapping two consecutive days of gain.
Besides ITC , Tata Motors and ONGC that gained in 3-4 per cent range, major Sensex gainers included Hindustan Unilever, SBI, Axis Bank, Hero MotoCorp, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto, GAIL, HDFC Ltd and TCS.
The 50-share NSE Nifty, after slipping below the 8100 mark to touch a low of 8,064.80, bounced back to close 24.85 points, or 0.31 per cent, higher at 8,146.30.
Both the key indices Sensex and Nifty, which were struggling to maintain 27,000 and 8,100-mark in early trades, managed to close above these levels.
“A fresh spell of buying in recent under-performers was a notable feature of today’s session,” said Deepak Pahwa, a Delhi-based broker.
Short covering ahead of monthly expiry on Thursday was also seen in select blue-chip stocks, traders said.
Small-cap index was up 0.51 per cent and Mid-cap rose by 0.20 per cent, indicating continued retail investor interest.
Buying activity also picked up momentum in non-Sensex stocks. Gitanjali Gems, PC Jewellers, Petronet LNG, Jaiprakash Associates and PPAP Automotive, among others, logged gains.
A weak closing in Asian stocks and a lower opening in Europe on reports that China dampened speculation on a potential, however, capped the gains on domestic bourses.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 6.53 crore last Friday as per provisional data.
Sectorally, the BSE Consumer Durables sector index gained the most by surging 3.12 per cent, followed by FMCG index 1.90 per cent. Auto index 1.10 per cent, Oil & Gas index 0.88 per cent, and Banking index 0.29 per cent.

Silver at 4-yr low  gold tests $1200 | Brent...Brent falls back below $98 on sluggish demand, ample supply

Save precious time tracking your investments
SINGAPORE: Brent crude fell below $98 a barrel on Monday, down for the third session in four, as sluggish demand and ample supplies outweighed a possible cut in oil output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
Comments from OPEC's secretary general last week that the group could cut output next year buoyed Brent on Friday, but investors' attention turned back to the gloomy economic outlook in Europe and China which has curbed oil demand.
A cut in Libya's oil production also had limited impact on prices.
November Brent was trading 57 cents lower at $97.82 a barrel by 0645 GMT after posting its first weekly rise in three last week.
US crude for October delivery fell 60 cents to $91.81 a barrel, ahead of the expiry of the contract at the end of Monday.
"When you look at the increase in supplies in the past year, you see very strong growth in the United States in particular from non-conventional sources and also in other non-OPEC producing areas ... supply growth is not being driven by OPEC," said Phin Ziebell, economist at the National Australia Bank (NAB).
OPEC members, some of whom require oil prices at above $100 to meet budgetary needs, will review the organization's oil output policy at its next meeting on Nov. 27.
Oil production in Libya on the other hand had fallen to 700,000 barrels per day, down nearly 20 per cent from 870,000 bpd a week ago as its El Sharara oilfeld and Zawiya refinery are still closed, said a spokesman for the state-run National Oil Corp (NOC) on Sunday.
But concerns over an extended stagnation in Europe that could pull the other economies down was highlighted at the G20 meeting in Australia on Sunday.
"We expect weak global demand for crude oil to have already been priced in based on the drop in prices we have seen in the past few months. We believe it is very unlikely that prices would increase," Phillip Futures said in a note dated Sept. 22.
Investors will look for cues on where demand from China, the world's second-largest economy , is heading from its flash manufacturing PMI reading due out on Tuesday. Earlier, the world's top energy consumer had reported that this month marked the slowest factory output growth in nearly six years, partly causing Brent to slump under $97, the lowest in more than two years.
"The overall story is of abundant supply and very slack demand being coupled with an increasing lack of nervousness about geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the Ukraine," Ziebell of NAB said.
In signs that western sanctions could impact Russian oil and gas production in the long run, Exxon Mobil said on Friday it would wind down drilling in Russia's Arctic in the face of US sanctions targeting Western cooperation with Moscow's oil sector.
French jets struck a suspected Islamic State target in Iraq for the first time on Friday, expanding a US-led military campaign against militants who have seized a third of the country and also control large parts of neighbouring Syria.
Fighting has also intensified in southern Libya as soldiers and police clashed in the last few days near the country's biggest oilfield El Sharara. The field was shut last week because of damage to a storage facility at the Zawiya refinery in the north, which it feeds.

At over $25 bn  Alibaba s IPO is biggest-eve...Alibaba IPO ranks as world's biggest after additional shares sold
By Reuters | 22 Sep, 2014, 08.41AM IST
The move comes after the stock surged 38 percent in its debut on Friday as investors jostled for a piece of the e-commerce company.

Save precious time tracking your investments
HONG KONG: Alibaba's initial public offering now ranks as the world's biggest at $25 billion, netting underwriters of the sale a more than $300 million windfall after the e-commerce giant and some shareholders parted with additional shares.
The fees are equivalent to 1.2 per cent of the total deal, with Alibaba paying $121.8 million in commissions. Selling shareholders are set to pay another $178.6 million, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.
Overwhelming demand saw the IPO initially raise $21.8 billion, and then sent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's stock surging 38 per cent in its debut on Friday. That prompted underwriters to exercise an option to sell an additional 48 million shares, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said.
That means the IPO has surpassed a previous global record set by Agricultural Bank of China Ltd in 2010, when the lender raised $22.1 billion.
According to its prospectus, Alibaba had agreed to sell 26.1 million additional shares under the option, and Yahoo Inc
an additional 18.3 million, netting the two companies an extra $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion respectively.
Alibaba's Jack Ma had agreed under the same option to sell an extra 2.7 million shares and company co-founder Joe Tsai agreed to 902,782 additional shares.
The source declined to be identified as the details of the additional sale have yet to be made official.
Alibaba declined to comment.
Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley acted as joint bookrunners of the IPO.
Rothschild was hired as Alibaba's independent financial advisor on the deal.

GST Implementation From April 2016  Feasible: Revenue SecretaryManufacturing Growth May Moderate in December Quarter: Industry Body
New Delhi: As negotiations with states on GST enter a critical stage, the Centre is looking forward to implementation of the new indirect tax regime from April 1, 2016.
"The deadline for actual implementation of GST from April 1, 2016, would be feasible. It all depend on how quickly we are able to reach consensus on critical issues," Revenue Secretary Shakti Kanta Das said at an event here.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime aims at subsuming most of the indirect taxes at the central as well as state level. The UPA government in 2011 introduced a Constitution Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha to pave the way for introduction of GST.
The GST which has been pending since 2006, is stuck at a crucial stage where states have proposed to keep products such as petroleum, tobacco and alcohol out of GST ambit and had demanded the exemption list be included in the Constitutional Amendment Bill.
As regards the compensation structure, the states have sought a five year compensation mechanism from the Centre and demanded the same be included in the Constitutional Amendment Bill.
"The discussions are at a very critical stage and we hope to make very good progress. We are quite optimistic we will be able to reach convergence in the coming weeks or months," Mr Das added.
He said there are 4-5 issues with the states that are outstanding and on each there have been discussions in recent weeks.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting to take stock of the proposed new indirect tax regime and decided to soon clear the pending CST compensation for revenue loss incurred by states.
"We hope and we are quite optimistic that we will be able to resolve (it) in the coming months, which will enable the government to introduce the constitutional amendments in Parliament," Mr Das said.

Prime Minister s US Visit: What awaits Narendra ModiPrime Minister's US Visit: What awaits Narendra Modi
Sep 21, 2014, 03.24PM IST
(A mishmash of euphoria,…)
By: Sujeet Rajan
NEW YORK: When it comes to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to the US later this month, there is diverse reaction — euphoria and indifference; cautious optimism of new economic fronts sprouting; as well as a heavy dose of scepticism.
Some wave it off as blase — a tedious deja vu of a diplomatic role play, with minimal results forthcoming. Others see it as an opportune moment to protest.
The euphoria is mostly among the Gujarati community, especially in the Tristate areas of New York City and New Jersey. The public reception for Modi at the Madison Square Garden (MSG) on September 28 is what they are waiting to savour, the lynchpin of his five-day visit — at least for these supporters.
The organizers were warned by the Prime Minister's Office not to make it an all-Gujarati show. So tickets were allocated to different Indian American organizations all over the country. An overwhelming response led to a lottery thrown in to determine 1,500 individual tickets.
Sellout Crowd
Seven hundred of the 20,000 total seats at the MSG have been sold to patron members, donors and advertisers, to cover the $1.5-million expense, out of which 20 seats are worth $50,000 each, said Bharat Barai, the organizer of the meet and a close confidant of Modi, in an interview to The Economic Times Magazine. "We have been fair, transparent and methodical in allocating tickets," said Barai.
Modi will be speaking on a rotating stage. By the time he's done with his speech, he would have made a 360° turn. Like at the United Nations, headphones and translations will be available for all invited dignitaries, apart from English sub-titles on giant screens. His speech will also stream live on the Fox Studios outdoor big screen at Times Square.
No community member will share the stage with Modi. Introductions to some 30-odd US Senators and Congressmen who have been invited, would be done by the emcees, former Miss America Nina Davuluri and newscaster Hari Sreenivasan. Billionaire Vivek Ranadive's daughter Anjali gets to sing the US national anthem, while playback singer Kavita Krishnamurthy will in all likelihood sing the Indian anthem.
Violin maestro L Shankar will perform, to become only the second Indian-origin musician to perform at the venue, after Ravi Shankar's iconic concert for Bangladesh in July, 1971.
Actress Preity Zinta will be in the audience. Some Bollywood stars had offered their services for the occasion, but were turned down, according to a source.
In New York, Modi is also expected to visit Ground Zero after his address to the UN General Assembly on September 27 and pay his respects at the 9/11 museum there, apart from attending an NGO-organized annual meet 'Global Citizens Festival' at the Central Park, where he is scheduled to give a 15-minute talk on eradicating poverty by 2030. Around 40,000 people attend the festival every year. Modi will also attend several private receptions, including two back-to-back ones at The Pierre hotel overlooking Central Park, organized by the US India Business Council, and the Indian embassy, after his show at the MSG on the 28th.
  The Tough Part
Things will change for Modi once he begins the tough part of his trip: Washington, DC. The rock star status Modi is likely to enjoy in New York is bound to come down by a few notches on Capitol Hill, as experts would look for only one thing — results from his meeting with President Barack Obama over two days, which includes a dinner on the 29th.
Many experts feel India needs to prove to the US that it's ready to take equal responsibility on global issues, not just seek avenues to boost ties on the economic front.
Christine Fair, assistant professor in the Center for Peace and Security Studies at Georgetown University's Edmund A Walsh School of Foreign Service, and the author of Fighting To The End - The Pakistan Army's Way of War, said in an interview to The Economic Times Magazine that the Obama administration, while being sceptical of further economic reforms in India, would "like to see the Indian government act like one, to be a global power". Fair added: "Different people are looking at different relationships [from the Obama-Modi meet]. I would like to see a discussion on what India can do on security issues, on more intelligence issues."
Fair pointed out that India has not been cooperative with the US on Russia, and has been hedging on Syria. "India has not been very imaginative with the US on these issues. India is offering a no value proposition on these issues, so I don't see anything significant coming from this visit," said Fair, adding that the US will look to India to cooperate on fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, monitoring the situation in Afghanistan, while India will seek help in curbing the designs of the al-Qaeda.
Remember 2002?

Asked if Swaraj would be accompanying Modi when he goes to the US, the Spokesperson said she will precede the Prime Minister and will stay back to attend a UN event to mark Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary as 'Day of Non-violence' on October 2.
The External Affairs Minister will join the Prime Minister's official delegation and will accompany him for rest of his engagements including in Washington when Modi will be meeting US President Barack Obama on September 30, he replied further.
The External Affairs Minister will also attend a meeting on Palestine in the UN.
Giving the details of Swaraj's programme, Akbaruddin said she will also attend meetings of foreign ministers of G-15, Commonwealth countries among other plurilaterals.

Save precious time tracking your investments
By Arvind Singhal
Prime minister Narendra Modi recently remarked in Japan that India now speaks in trillions rather than in billions. There is at least one $1 trillion matter that he must direct his party and his bureaucrats to apply their minds too (and keep rhetoric and dogma aside while they do so).
India's current consumer spending on merchandise (and hence the size of India's retail market) is about $550 billion. By 2020, it will touch or exceed $1 trillion. There are many drivers for this strong growth that go beyond the overall economic growth of the nation. A young population, convergence in lifestyle aspirations across urban and rural India, rise of dual (or multiple) income households especially in urban India are some of the more wellknown growth drivers. However, there is also a new growth driver and one that could completely transform what India will buy, from where it will buy, and how it will buy. And that new growth driver is e-commerce and for merchandise, it is e-tail.
A Ticking Bomb
What started no more than 10 years ago as a new and more efficient platform to sell books and music has now gone way beyond the traditional merchandise categories that are sold online. There are now housing launches (Tata), new car launches (Mahindra), jewellery including expensive solitaires, and healthcare (DNA testing), to list a few creative experiments. With rapid increase in penetration of smartphones and the new government's renewed thrust on making broadband reach far and wide through its "Digital India" project, e-networks are expected to be the new bank branches, schools and colleges, and shopping and entertainment centres.
In this backdrop, taxation jurisdiction and taxation applicability issues such as the one that is currently vexing both the Karnataka tax authorities and Amazon are poised to flare up in just about every state in India, and create frequent obstacles not only for private businesses such as Amazon and Flipkart and many others but also the government's own initiatives that endeavour a digital platform aided delivery of goods and services. To be fair to the tax authorities both at the state and the Centre, the spectacular rise of e-commerce in India has taken just about everyone by surprise (other than the diehard e-business evangelists/entrepreneurs and the Indian consumer). Unlike the traditional supply chains of distributing goods and services from producers to the consumers, the e-business models and e-biz supply chains can be very different.
The so-called market place model is perhaps no different in concept than the classified advertisement listings in print media and Yellow Pages earlier, and the managed inventory models make some of the e-tail businesses look more like warehousing and delivery businesses rather than classical retail businesses. With this blurring of lines about ownership of merchandise, the location of physical stocking, the place where actual transaction takes place, and the actual point of delivery can rightfully be any tax administration's nightmare; and especially in a federal structure such as the one that we have in India where sharing of tax revenues on each taxable activity between states and the central governments has always been a vexing matter in the best of circumstances.

Selling women’s wear online a different ball game, companies have learnt that hard way
Rasul Bailay, ET Bureau Sep 20, 2014, 04.00AM IST

(Sizes are an issue initially,…)
NEW DELHI: "Hi, your six body woes fixed," says the mailer from the ecommerce site. Regardless of how much you measure bust-wise or around the waist, or even if you have "wobbly arms", there's a dress just for you because "no body is perfect". Size really does matter, online retailers have come to realise.
While they've made deep inroads into selling electronics and books, ecommerce sites have figured out the hard way that selling women's wear online is a different ball game. Some brand owners actually don't think it will work because Indian women have body types that differ sharply from western ones, but others are working hard at solutions to crack the market. Adding to the difficulty is the lack of standardisation — one brand's size X differs from that of another.
A prominent American lingerie brand planning to enter India through ecommerce, avoiding the brick and mortar route, ran into this when it found that samples sent to India were inadequate. The company is now despatching bigger sizes to conduct fit tests before launching its products later this year. "The Indian body shape is different to the western body shape, so doing a fit test is extremely critical before you launch," says Nitin Chhabra, chief executive of ecommerce consultancy firm Ace Turtle, which is advising the US lingerie brand. "When we did the sample fit test, we found that the bra was not really fitting." He declined to identify the brand.
Biji Paul, a New Delhi homemaker, has actually stopped buying clothes online because they seldom fit her properly and she finds the returns process too tedious. She's sticking to traditional brick and mortar. On the other hand, Mansi Tiwari in Bhopal swears by online.
Sizes are an issue initially, especially when trying new brands, but reverse pickups are arranged in a day by online retailers. "Definitely, there's trial and error but exchanges happen easily." Besides, she points out, there's really no other option because Bhopal stores won't carry those brands or styles.
Clearly, there's huge market potential. Already, at the end of FY2014, fashion and lifestyle comprised 25% of India's $2.3 billion online retail business while electronics commanded a share of about 30%, according to retail consultancy Technopak Advisors. Fashion and lifestyle is expected to grow annually at 20-25% and the segment is expected to increase its share of India's overall online retail market to about 30% by 2019, by when the ecommerce total could be worth anywhere between $19 billion and $38 billion.
To be sure, the ability to drape different body shapes is part of what it means to be a successful global garment marketer--witness the Levi's Curve campaign, for instance. And, some experts are sceptical about whether this actually should constitute a hurdle at all.
"It is not a challenge and it was never a challenge. Human bodies in any part of the world are different. If someone says American bodies are uniform or British bodies are uniform, it completely misses the point because you have all types and shapes in every country anywhere in the world," says Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak Advisors.
"So, this was a myth being created earlier and it has been completely debunked by the success of brands like Zara, Mango and Forever 21." The solution, according to ecommerce site Fashionara.com, is to get as much detail as possible.
"We recognize that we are in the early stages of our venture so what we have done is that for every garment we sell on our site, we go deeper into measuring all those aspects including waist, chest, neck sizes, sleeve size," says Darpan Munjal, co-founder of Fashionara.com.
"You will see the chart we show on our site go into much depth than what a typical brand would carry on its label."Fashionara's customers have the option of ordering three different sizes to try at home and picking the one that fits. Almost 70% of consumers opt for this in the cities where the company offers this service, Munjal says.
Some companies that don't provide such facilities are grappling with higher return rates. Currently, almost a quarter of the orders on major e-commerce companies are returned and half of them comprise apparel sent back due to size issues, says Praveen Sinha, founder of Jabong.com.
  "Size is a challenge whether it is online or offline. Offline you can go for a trial," points out Ganesh Subramanian, chief operating officer of Myntra.com, which is being taken over by Flipkart, India's biggest online retailer.
Myntra is planning to introduce virtual measurement technology that will automatically convert the customer's known sizes.
"We are trying to provide a size comparison tool of brand A to brand B," says Subramanian. "It will ask what brand and which size fits you and ask what brand the consumer is looking at and it will recommend what size of that brand will fit the consumer."

It's a fast food favourite that got off to a slow start, but India is finally flipping on burgers. Over the last few months, five of the top burger chains in the world, including Burger King , Fatburger, Johnny Rockets and Wendy's, have announced their entry into the country.
"This is just the beginning," says Samir Chopra, group chairman of Cybiz Corp which is bringing American burger restaurant chain Carl's Jr to India. He attributes the growing popularity of burgers in the country to the fact that unlike pizza, a burger is a more convenient form of fast food. "When it comes to pizzas, a slice is finger food. But in most cases, you have to order a whole pizza. A burger can be quickly ordered and had on the go," he says, revealing that Carl's Jr will start operations this year with 100 outlets across Delhi, Gurgaon, Chandigarh, Ludhiana, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad, with plans to scale up to around 1,000 restaurants.
Wendy's, the third largest hamburger chain in the US, plans to make its India debut in the first quarter of 2015. Johnny Rockets — which positions itself as a 'better burger' chain with prices of approx Rs 300 a burger — has already opened in Delhi, and next up is Mumbai. Burger King, which created a stir in Japan last week with an all-black burger, comes to Mumbai and Delhi by the end of this year, and plans to open outlets in Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Surat by January 2015.
According to market research firm Crisil , the Indian fast food market is set to double in size from Rs 3,500 crore in 2012 to Rs 7,000 crore over the next two years. The total size of India's burger market is estimated to be around Rs 1,000 crore. The unorganized sector accounts for 40 per cent of sales while McDonald's controls 75 per cent of the market share in the organized sector. "There is room for everyone to grow," says Dhruv Kaul , chief marketing officer with KFC India , which introduced a paneer Zinger burger this year.
Interestingly, nearly 75 per cent of all burgers sold in the country are vegetarian. "Most Indians prefer vegetarian burgers and love spicy flavours. We have many more in the pipeline," says Kaul. Carl's Jr took three years to re-engineer their menu for India. "Sixty percent of the menu will be vegetarian," says Chopra. Fatburger, which launched in Gurgaon's Cyber Hub, is also focusing on veg options and Indian flavours such as Amritsari onion rings.

Profit-making PSUs want angel investments counted as CSRangel investments
(They have offered to bail…)
New Delhi: Profit-making state-run companies are willing to play angel investors in loss-making ones in a bid to turn them around, but they want their effort to be acknowledged and that they get the right incentives.
They have offered to bail out the loss-making companies if their revival efforts are counted towards the mandatory 2 per cent corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending.
"Companies are willing to come forward, but want such efforts to be part of their CSR activity," said a government official who is aware of the deliberations, but did not reveal the names of the companies. Under the Companies Law 2013, funds infusion to revive sick companies is not included as permissible CSR activity.
A senior official with a blue chip PSU emphasized that there has to be some incentive for nurturing a sick enterprise. "If there's no strategic advantage for us, which is the case with most sick companies, then including it in our CSR spend is most appropriate," he said.
UD Choubey, director-general of SCOPE, the apex body of central government-owned units, said all options should be explored. "It's important to revive these companies and the government should consider all viable options," he said.
According to government data, there were 61 sick public sector companies at end of March 2013. About 50 central public sector enterprises, including Air India, BSNL, MTNL and ITI, have been making losses for past three fiscals.
"We will take up this issue with the ministry of corporate affairs," said the above quoted government official, adding that such clause can also help rope in private players.
Earlier, the government had formed a committee under NTPC chairman Arup Roy Choudhury to look into the formation of a firm with mandate to revive or sell sick state-run enterprises

Alibaba s Big Debut: 10 Things to KnowRBL Bank Plans to Launch IPO in Three Quarters
New York: China's e-commerce giant Alibaba began trading its shares Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Here are ten things to know about Alibaba, and why its initial public offering made history:
The Biggest: Alibaba raised $21.8 billion in its debut, making it the biggest US-listed IPO in history after the IPO of credit card processing company Visa in 2008. If Alibaba's investment banks were to exercise their option to sell an additional 48 million shares, it could make Alibaba's IPO the biggest in the world, beating out the $22 billion IPO of Agricultural Bank of China in 2010. (Read: Largest IPOs in Stock Market History )
Don't forget Yahoo: It may have been a big day for Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma, but Yahoo's investors are feeling pretty good after Alibaba's IPO. Yahoo was an early investor in Alibaba, paying $1 billion for a stake in the company in 2005. Yahoo likely made $8.3 billion to $9.5 billion in Alibaba's IPO, and will still own a 16 per cent stake in the company worth $37.7 billion. (Read: Yahoo Rakes in Another Jackpot From Alibaba's IPO )
Alibaba eclipses Silicon Valley: Alibaba now has a market capitalization of roughly $219.8 billion, according to FactSet. That makes the company bigger than some of the US technology industry's most successful names, such as Facebook, eBay, and even Amazon.com.
All in one: Investors are interested in Alibaba because the company dominates many businesses in China that, here in the US, are run by individual companies. Alibaba owns the websites Tmall and Taobao, which are similar to Amazon.com and eBay, respectively. The company also earns money from transaction fees related to its various businesses through Alipay, which is like PayPal. That's just three of Alibaba's many subsidiaries.
Big profits: Unlike the US e-commerce giant Amazon, Alibaba has been consistently profitable. The company had $8.5 billion in sales in its latest fiscal year ending in March, with net income of $3.8 billion. The year prior, Alibaba had $5.4 billion in sales and $1.4 billion in profits. In comparison, Amazon sold $74.4 billion in goods in 2013, but made only $274 million in profits that year. In 2012, Amazon reported a net loss of $39 million. (Also Read: Alibaba: China's Giant Online Shopping 'Crocodile' )
Risks: If Alibaba does well for investors, it will be the exception to what has been the trend for Chinese companies. When Chinese companies have listed stocks on American markets, their shares have lost an average 1 per cent a year for the next three years, compared with an average 7 per cent annual gain for other US IPOs, according to research by Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida.
Second time around: This isn't Alibaba's first time going public. Alibaba took its online shopping portal Alibaba.com public in 2007 in Hong Kong. Alibaba.com was a publicly traded company only for a few years. Alibaba took Alibaba.com private in 2012.
Solid gold: Jack Ma, who started Alibaba in 1999 in his apartment in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, is now among the richest people in the world. Ma's ownership in the company is worth roughly $18.2 billion, based on Alibaba's closing share price Friday. That doesn't include the shares he sold in the IPO, which are worth another $867 million, and his other investments. Bloomberg put his entire net worth at $21.9 billion, making him the 34th richest person in the world.
Big win for NYSE: Alibaba chose to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the second A-list technology company to go public on the Big Board in less than a year. The NYSE handled Twitter's IPO last year. NYSE's competitor, the Nasdaq Stock Market, has struggled to win the business of big tech companies since Facebook's IPO in 2012, which was plagued with technical problems.
Life is like a box of...: Jack Ma biggest hero is the fictional character Forrest Gump. "I really like that guy," Ma said, in an interview with business channel CNBC on Friday. "Every time I'm frustrated, I watch the movie. (The movie tells) me that no matter whatever changed, you are you." (Read: Alibaba's Jack Ma Rides 'Forrest Gump' Story to Riches )

European Commission building among targets of militantsPress Trust of India | Berlin | Posted: September 21, 2014 3:16 pm
The European Commission, the high-profile building that houses several thousand officials of the 28-nation European Union, was among the targets of ISIS linked militants returning from Syria, according to media reports.
The Belgian authorities have arrested several people during a crackdown. Two arrested people were from The Hague, Dutch public broadcaster NOS reported. “They were planning an attack. One of the targets was the European Commission building. Individual commissioners were not particularly targeted. It would be more like the Jewish museum attack with the aim to kill as many people as possible,” NOS reported, citing an informed source.
Belgian police reportedly found guns and bulletproof vests during the crackdown. The arrests and seizure of arms resulted from simultaneous home raids in Brussels and The Hague. One raid was reportedly carried out in The Hague’s Schilderswijk district, where a demonstration in support of the Islamic State (ISIS) recently took place.
ISIS is an al-Qaeda splinter group and it has seized hundreds of square miles in Iraq and Syria. Al-Qaeda has distanced itself from the group, chiding it for its lack of teamwork in its aggressive, brutal expansion. ISIS has in its ranks hundreds of European fighters.
Belgian daily L’Echo said the arrests come as authorities are investigating extremism in the region. According to reports, about 400 Belgians were fighting in Syria alongside jihadists and some of them have returned home. “Our starting point is that among them, one out of nine aim(s) to carry out an attack,” L’Echo’s reported, citing an unnamed source.
“We are working full time on the problem of the returning militants,” Belga news agency cited a federal judicial spokesman as saying. “We work together with the security services and that led us to carry out several operations,” the spokesman said.

Ukraine says won t pull back troops without full ceasefirePrint

Agence-France Presse | Donetsk | Posted: September 21, 2014 7:44 pm
Ukraine insisted on Sunday it would not pull back its troops from the frontline until all sides cease fire under a peace plan aimed at ending five months of bloodshed in the east.
Kiev and pro-Russian rebels are supposed to pull back their forces and weaponry to create a 30-kilometre (20-mile) wide buffer zone in line with a reinforced truce deal agreed in Minsk yesterday.
But heavy gunfire erupted around the eastern insurgent stronghold of Donetsk today, just hours after NATO’s top military commander had said there was a ceasefire “in name only” on the ground.
National Security and Defence Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko said the first point agreed in the Belarussian capital referring to a mutual ceasefire had to be respected before the rest of the plan could be implemented.
“But the first point has not yet been fulfilled, so we cannot speak about the other points,” he said.
“If (Ukrainian forces) are withdrawn, it will be done simultaneously with the Russian troop withdrawal.”
The nine-point Minsk plan is meant to reinforce a truce forged on September 5 in a bid to stem fighting that has claimed nearly 3,000 lives since April and threatened Ukraine’s very survival.
A rebel who identified himself as a member of Donetsk People’s Republic’s military intelligence said Ukrainian forces were continuing to shoot on insurgent positions around the airport although the attacks had dropped off in intensity and firepower.
“But when they fire we respond, of course,” the man who gave his name as Denis told AFP. “Each side wants to show the other they are still there.”
NATO’s top commander General Philip Breedlove said yesterday the continued clashes had shown it was a ceasefire “in name only” and accused Russia of keeping soldiers on Ukrainian soil to bolster the insurgents.
The truce was “still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,” he said on the sidelines of a NATO meeting symbolically convened in the ex-Soviet satellite state of Lithuania.
But he added: “It is our sincere hope and desire that… the two combatants can come to agreement to again get to a ceasefire situation.”
Lysenko said two soldiers had been killed over the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll since the original truce was declared to 37 servicemen and civilians.
There is no information on casualties from the rebel side.

Hyderabad-based start-up Smarturhas developed a mobile application (app) built on augmented reality that allows users of Android phone users and iOS mobile devices to click a selfie with Indian spaceship Mangalyaan that is due to land on Mars next week.
The Smartur app will provide the mobile users a platform to experience and participate in India's most important space programme milestone - the historic arrival of Mangalyaan on Mars on September 24, according to a release on Sunday.
The Smartur app is an augmented reality app that has been developed using a 3D model and provides the user with an almost 'real' experience of seeing the object (in this case Mangalyaan) in their living environment, the release said.
The app allows the participants to click and upload/share innovative pictures that can look like Mangalyaan is lifting off from their hands or out of their car or any other idea that comes to their mind, it said.
A participant would be required to download the app for free on their mobile device and take a print out of the 'Marker' (a marker is a design that helps the model the Mangalyaan to be placed in reality). The combination of the app and marker would give users an actual feel of being right there with the Mangalyaan, it said.

Sebi Bars 13 Entities for Large-Scale Global Depository Receipts ManipulationSebi Bars Transgene Chief, 5 Officials From Capital Markets
Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has barred as many as 13 entities from the  market for five years in a matter relating to manipulation of global depository receipts (GDRs) issued by some Indian companies.
In a strongly-worded order, the capital market regulator said that the illegal activities undertaken by these 13 entities can "jeopardise and tarnish the image of the securities market as a transparent and efficient way of raising capital, shaking the very foundation of capital market in India".
A detailed probe by Sebi found that these entities actively traded in the shares of GDR-issuer companies and thereby facilitated the sub accounts of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in selling those shares in Indian markets.
In its 48-page order, Sebi has consequently barred Basmati Securities, Oudh Finance and Investment, Alka India, SV Enterprise/Sarfaraz Khan Pathan, Ashok Panchariya, Madanlal Girdharilal Bugualiya and Indra Varun Trade Impex from the capital markets for five years.
Others facing the prohibition include Delight Financial Advisors, Vinod Amrutlaal Naai, Newgen International, Excel Paints, Cherry Cosmetics and Edelweiss Estate. 
Taking a lenient view in Gujarat Enterprise case, Sebi however said the company did not trade in the shares of GDR issuer firms but it is alleged to have acted as layer between the 13 entities for transfer of funds.
Although, Sebi warned Gujarat Enterprise to "ensure that all its future dealings in the securities markets may be done strictly in accordance with law".
The regulator also said that SV Enterprise, Oudh Finance and Investment, Basmati Securities and Alka India have already undergone a debarment of three years.
The prohibition already gone by these firms following a Sebi's interim order in September 2011 "shall be reduced while computing the period of debarment being imposed vide this order".
The Sebi probe revealed that GDR issue was devised by Pancharia in connivance with the issuer firms - Asahi Infrastructure & Projects, K Sera Sera, IKF Technologies, Avon Corp, CAT Technologies and Maars Software International - through a fraudulent manner. All of them made at least one GDR issue during 2007-09.
The securities were subsequently offloaded to Indian investors through various entities connected to Panchariya. The 13 entities were connected to Panchariya and collectively referred as CP Group.
Through its interim order in September 2011, Sebi banned these issuer companies from issuing equity shares or any other instrument convertible into equities. 
"I am of the considered view that trades in the scrip of the issuer companies were carried out by the CP group alongwith sub accounts in an irregular and manipulative nature," Sebi whole-time member S Raman said in the final order dated September 19 this year.

September 21, 2014
A study published in Nature  this week provides evidence of a link between artificial sweeteners and diabetes, and the media is all over it. “ Artificial sweeteners may disrupt body’s blood sugar controls ,” wrote the New York Times; “ Diet soda may alter our gut microbes and raise the risk of diabetes ,” reported NPR.
As a science journalist myself, I considered writing something about the study, too. But the research, while noteworthy, didn’t strike me as particularly new or exciting. That’s partly due to the fact that I’ve read about  other studies  investigating the  potentially harmful effects  of artificial sweeteners. It’s also because of personal experience.
In 2008, I was a volunteer subject in a clinical trial investigating whether artificial sweeteners provoke metabolic responses similar to the effects of real sugar—the same big question posed by the study that came out this week—at the National Institutes of Health. Nine people with Type 1 diabetes (including me), 10 people with Type 2 diabetes, and 25 people without diabetes underwent an experiment in which we drank artificially-sweetened diet soda followed by a carbohydrate-rich shake one day, and on an alternate day we drank unsweetened seltzer with the shake instead. Our gut hormones and blood sugar levels were monitored closely on both days.
The study found  that ingesting acesulfame-K- and sucralose-sweetened diet soda in addition to carbohydrates, the same way someone might drink a diet coke while eating french fries and a burger for lunch, led to an increase in an insulin-regulating hormone in healthy subjects and those with Type 1 diabetes. It was almost as if our bodies thought we needed more insulin when we consumed diet soda with our food.
Scientists at NIH have continued to investigate the effects of sugar substitutes on blood glucose and the endocrine system. In  other studies , they’ve found that consumption of diet soda is associated with statistically significant increases in insulin production in some subjects and markedly higher blood sugar levels in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. Kristina Rother, one of the principal investigators on these studies, says the results support the hypothesis that artificial sweeteners induce insulin resistance—a condition associated with Type 2 diabetes and obesity.
 “Things don’t have to be shocking and new to get this shocking and new treatment.” 
Rother points to her colleague Susan Schiffman as one of the first to show that artificial sweeteners affect gut bacteria in rodents— research  (PDF) that created a stir when it was published  in 2008 . Years earlier, Schiffman had been quoted alongside David Katz, from Yale,  in a 2005 New York Times article  questioning the safety of Splenda.
There have been a lot of major news stories about the science behind artificially sweetened products. But I didn’t see a single one  this week  that acknowledged the ones written  earlier this year , or in 2008, or 2005.
More often than not, each individual story gives the impression that the latest science is either totally new or surprisingly compelling. “It seems to amplify every time,” Purdue University’s Susan Swithers told Quartz. “Things don’t have to be shocking and new to get this shocking and new treatment.” Swithers herself has been featured in news stories about artificial sweeteners and diabetes, including an NPR one  asking “Do diet drinks mess up metabolisms?” in 2013 .
Not many news outlets have the space, time or resources to contextualize, at length, each meaningful scientific study. But  there’s something wrong  with a cycle in which reporters constantly react to press releases from academic institutions or scientific journals by generating uniquely attention-grabbing stories based on each one.
Virginia Hughes, a contributing editor at Popular Science,  points to  the numerous articles that have been written about resveratrol (the oft-heralded compound in red wine) as an example: Each piece is accurate and fair, but in aggregate they’re a jumble of contradictions. And they don’t reference each other—there’s little acknowledgment, in each bit of reporting, that other reporting has occurred on other studies and that this jumble of contradictions exists. “Should we switch to a more explanatory, wiki-like model, so that a single study’s results are more fully contextualized?” Hughes wonders. “Should we be writing stories about batches of studies — maybe the last 10 studies of resveratrol, as opposed to the single newest one?” (To that, I say yes, please: This is the time and place for those card stacks and continuously-updated posts at Ezra Klein’s  Vox .)
And while a journalist may describe the details of the science correctly— “the researchers analyzed the blood-sugar levels and gut bacteria colonies of 381 participants” —his or her story, taken on its own, doesn’t give readers an accurate representation of how scientific research works. Science is slow; it takes baby steps, and what may look like the “first” piece of evidence about something is usually more like the tenth or twelfth. Former Washington Post reporter David Brown explained this eloquently in a 2008 speech at the University of Iowa ( you can read the full text here ):
We in the media live in a time of incredible competition for readers’ attention—from television, radio, magazines both real and online, the gigantic blogosphere, and sometimes even our own websites. At the same time, getting on Page 1 is almost all that counts. It has always been important.
Science stories, and especially medical stories, have a really good shot of getting out on Page 1. They are inherently interesting and they appeal to what might be termed, somewhat cynically, as the narcissism of the reader. But that often isn’t enough to get them on the front page. To get there, the story must emphasize novelty, potency, and certainty in a way that, as a general rule, rarely exists in a piece of scientific research.
The Nature paper is a well-done, illuminating bit of research, and it’s a great addition to the cumulative work of other scientists, including Swithers, Rother, and Schiffman. Downplaying the “cumulative” part of the story, though, does a disservice to readers—even well-informed ones. Nutrition expert Marion Nestle  recently blogged  about the Nature study and expressed some skepticism about the fact that the bulk of the research was done on mice. But larger trials have been done on humans and the NIH is about to start another human trial to see what happens when a bunch of healthy “non-users” of artificial sweeteners start eating sucralose. That’s information that most major media outlets failed to mention in their articles about this study.
Perhaps they just didn’t have the time.

Shiv Sena makes  final offer  of 119 seats  BJP leaves decision to ModiComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party in Maharashtra on Monday rejected ally Shiv Sena's 'final' offer of 119 seats, thus worsening the crisis in the saffron alliance.
BJP president Amit Shah called up Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and urged him not to break the 25-year old alliance, TV reports said. Shah also requested the Sena to rethink on seat sharing for the 288-member assembly polls.
This comes amid indications that the BJP  is readying a Plan B with state leaders telling Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they would rather go it alone than accept this.
Modi is now expected to attempt a reconciliation. In New Delhi, the BJP’s top brass took stock of the seat sharing talks, but kept its cards close to its chest.
After a meeting of its parliamentary board, Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah had a separate 10-minute-long meeting. The party remain tight-lipped about it.
The Sena has given the BJP a breather saying it would wait till Monday. The last date for filing nominations is September 27.
“Modi may not immediately sanction an extreme step and could try and convince the Sena chief,” said a BJP leader close to the developments.
For over a fortnight, the saffron combine has been squabbling over the formula for sharing the 288 assembly seats going to polls on October 15.
Earlier in the day, Thackeray speaking at his party’s national executive meeting in Mumbai, told a cheering crowd of Sainiks to prepare to go solo if the talks did not fructify.
In what his partymen saw as his best-ever public speech, Thackeray said his formula  -- of 151 seats for the Sena, 119 for the BJP and 18 for smaller allies --  was his last-ditch effort to save the alliance.
HT Analysis: Uddhav wary of BJP’s Maha ambitions
The BJP responded within the hour. “We fought 119 seats in 2009, even now they are offering us 119. How is this justified,” asked senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse. Talking in New Delhi, he said the two parties should reshuffle the 59 seats the Sena has not won in the past three elections and 19 the BJP had not won and then arrive at a figure.
“Also, these talks cannot take place through television. We need to sit face-to-face,” Khadse added, saying the BJP was still open to talks, putting the ball back into the Sena’s court. BJP insiders said the party had readied a list of 130 candidates and was waiting for word from the top leaders to release it.
In his speech, Thackeray criticised the present batch of BJP leaders reminding them of how the alliance, formed by LK Advani, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and Pramod Mahajan with the late Bal Thackeray, came together not for power but for Hindutva.
“We had differences of opinion with Mahajan and [Gopinath] Munde too. But our relationship never got strained like it has happened now. We both knew how much to stretch,” he said. He reminded Modi that the Shiv Sena stood by him during the riots in Gujarat.
He also warned the BJP against creating hurdles when a golden opportunity to win the state elections has arisen, just as they kept to the alliance dharma during the Lok Sabha polls.
The Sena chief did not hide his chief ministerial ambitions either. “If you are looking down on the Shiv Sena, then our sainiks are ready to fight back. Get ready to face consequences…. I promise to capture power in Maharashtra at any cost,” Thackeray said.
The state BJP  is bent on teaching the Sena a lesson, but the party’s central leadership thinks a break-up could mar the BJP’s credibility among other allies.
“Any decision needs to be taken with some solid foresight. No doubt that the Sena has us in a catch-22 position, but then we need to find a solution that will go a long away,” said a BJP leader.
While a decision to split has not yet been finalised, the break-up of this long-time friendship is sure to change the political map of Maharashtra for years to come.

3 months after LS polls  MP stays as Raje ministerPrint
Written by Liz Mathew | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:17 am
More than three months after he was elected to the Lok Sabha, BJP leader Sanwar Lal Jat has not given up his ministerial post in the Rajasthan state government. Despite protests from the opposition, Sanwar Lal has said he will not leave his post in Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje’s cabinet, citing a Constitutional provision to back his stand.
Sanwar Lal had vacated the Nasirabad Assembly constituency to contest the Lok Sabha polls from Ajmer. By-election for the seat was held on September 13, and Ramnarayan Gujjar of the Congress was elected MLA. Sanwar Lal, however, continues to hold the portfolios of Water Resources, Indira Gandhi Canal Project, Public Health Engineering, Ground Water, Command Area Development and Water Utilisation in the state government. He also attended the week-long special session of the Assembly, which was adjourned sine die on September 18.
“It is allowed in the Constitution. I am allowed to continue as minister for six months without being a member of the Assembly. I am not doing anything unconstitutional,” Sanwar Lal told The Indian Express, adding that many Congress leaders have done the same in the past.
The Congress, which has 24 legislators in the 200-member Assembly, has sought the intervention of President Pranab Mukherjee and the state Governor. It has also asked the speaker to disqualify him. “It is unconstitutional, illegal and unethical for him to continue as a minister. There was a by-election in his constituency and the Congress candidate won it,” said Sachin Pilot, president of the Congress unit in Rajasthan.
Subhash Kashyap, a constitutional expert, said, “The constitution provides a six-month gap for a minister to get elected to the house. So, in strict legal terms, he can use this provision as an excuse to continue as minister. However, it involves high constitutional impropriety.” Kashyap added that the Constitution does not speak about a situation in which an elected MP continues as a minister in the state because those who framed the Constitution did not envisage such a scenario. “To quote a former speaker, the Constitution was drafted by gentlemen for gentlemen,” he said.
BJP leaders, meanwhile, pointed out that in April 1999, when then Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government faced a crucial trust vote, Congress leader Giridhar Gamang, who had already taken over as the chief minister of Orissa, took part in the voting in which the government fell by one vote.
BJP sources said that Sanwar Lal’s decision is also a result of the party’s “inner issues”. They said that the differences between the CM and the party’s central leadership have delayed the process of the state cabinet expansion. “Once the cabinet reshuffle takes place, there will be a decision on Sanwar Lal too,” sources said.

Crude oil prices down ahead of Chinese manufacturing dataCrude oil prices down ahead of Chinese manufacturing data
PTI
Tweet
Singapore, Sept 22:  
Crude oil prices fell in Asia today as dealers await key Chinese manufacturing data for clues about demand in the world’s top energy consumer, analysts said.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery eased 31 cents to $92.10, while Brent crude for November fell 44 cents to $97.95 in late-morning trade.
China’s manufacturing PMI
Desmond Chua, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, said tomorrow’s release of HSBC’s flash September purchasing managers index (PMI) for the Chinese manufacturing sector comes “after a bout of economic reports came in below expectations’’.
He added that another weak reading “will underscore weakness in the Chinese economy’’.
Singapore’s United Overseas Bank (UOB) said the “market is expecting a further decline in the PMI to 50.0 from 50.2 in August after having retreated from 51.7 in July.”
The index tracks manufacturing activity in China’s factories and workshops and is a closely watched indicator of the health of the economy. A reading above 50 indicates growth.
US, euro zone PMI
UOB said investors will also be scrutinising US and euro zone PMI data to be released Tuesday.
They are also keeping tabs on Scotland. While voters on Friday rejected independence, the close strength of the campaign for a break from Westminster will usher in a major shake-up that will give the country more autonomy.
While there is no clear path for crude prices following the result, the vote has put into focus the future of large reserves in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland.

BSE Sensex dips below 27k-level  falls 166 pointsBSE Sensex rose modestly on Monday to notch its fourth consecutive session of gains.
Agencies | Posted: September 22, 2014 10:22 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 4:39 pm
After slipping below 27K level in early trades, the benchmark Sensex today recovered smartly to end with a gain of over 116 points at 27,206.74 on good buying in bluechips including ITC, Tata Motors and ONGC even as global cues remained weak.
After a lower start at 27,008.12, the Sensex dipped below the 27,000-mark to touch a low of 26,918.93, down over 170 points. Buying after mid-session, however, lifted the BSE index to settle at 27,206.74, logging a gain of 116.32 points, or 0.43 per cent.
On Friday, the index had fallen 21.79 points, snapping two consecutive days of gain.
Besides ITC , Tata Motors and ONGC that gained in 3-4 per cent range, major Sensex gainers included Hindustan Unilever, SBI, Axis Bank, Hero MotoCorp, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto, GAIL, HDFC Ltd and TCS.
The 50-share NSE Nifty, after slipping below the 8100 mark to touch a low of 8,064.80, bounced back to close 24.85 points, or 0.31 per cent, higher at 8,146.30.
Both the key indices Sensex and Nifty, which were struggling to maintain 27,000 and 8,100-mark in early trades, managed to close above these levels.
“A fresh spell of buying in recent under-performers was a notable feature of today’s session,” said Deepak Pahwa, a Delhi-based broker.
Short covering ahead of monthly expiry on Thursday was also seen in select blue-chip stocks, traders said.
Small-cap index was up 0.51 per cent and Mid-cap rose by 0.20 per cent, indicating continued retail investor interest.
Buying activity also picked up momentum in non-Sensex stocks. Gitanjali Gems, PC Jewellers, Petronet LNG, Jaiprakash Associates and PPAP Automotive, among others, logged gains.
A weak closing in Asian stocks and a lower opening in Europe on reports that China dampened speculation on a potential, however, capped the gains on domestic bourses.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 6.53 crore last Friday as per provisional data.
Sectorally, the BSE Consumer Durables sector index gained the most by surging 3.12 per cent, followed by FMCG index 1.90 per cent. Auto index 1.10 per cent, Oil & Gas index 0.88 per cent, and Banking index 0.29 per cent.

Rupee weakens to 60.85 in early tradeRupee trading flat at 60.83
Our Bureau/PTI
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The rupee was trading flat at 60.83 against the dollar at 4.15 p.m. local time.
After opening a tad weak at 60.85 against the previous close of 60.83 per dollar due to increased demand for the American currency from importers amid a weak opening in the domestic equity market, the domestic unit hovered in the range of 60.74 and 60.86 in the afternoon trade.
Forex dealers said besides the dollar’s gains against other currencies overseas, fresh demand from importers for the American unit had put pressure on the rupee.
“The RBI will likely maintain its Rs 58-62 per dollar “range of tolerance” for USD/INR until it is able to build up sufficient FX reserves – close to 10 months’ import cover – which looks unlikely over our forecast horizon,” said Indranil Sen Gupta in a report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Call rates and G-secs
The interbank call money rate, the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from one another, was trading higher at 8.09 per cent from Friday’s close of 7.75 per cent.
Prices of the 10-year benchmark 8.40 per cent government security, maturing in 2024, were also trading higher at Rs 99.74 from the previous close of Rs 99.62. Yield on the bond further softened to 8.43 per cent from 8.45 per cent.

2 killed  many injured in explosions in ChinasXinjiangPress Trust of India | Beijing | Posted: September 22, 2014 10:43 am
At least two persons were killed and several others injured in a series of explosions in China’s restive Muslim-dominated Xinjiang province.
Explosions hit at least three locations in Xinjiang’s Luntai County Sunday evening, the Tianshan news portal, run by the regional government, said in a short report Monday morning.
The report did not identify the explosions, which appeared to be coordinated attacks, as acts of terrorism, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.
“The local social order was normal,” the Tianshan said, indicating that there was no further unrest following the explosions.
An unspecified number of those wounded have been admitted to hospitals, the report said.
Investigations were ongoing, the Post said.
Photos in Weibo, akin Twitter in China, showed smoke billowing out in two locations with widespread damage to the vehicles.
More than half of the county’s 113,000 residents are ethnic Uygurs, according to local census information.
A series of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang shocked China this year, with the latest in early August when 37 civilians were killed and another 13 injured in Shache County of Kashgar Prefecture.
China blames the attacks on East Turkestan Islamic Movement, an al-Qaeda backed organisation active in Xinjiang province where the native Muslim Uygurs were restive over the increasing settlements of Hans from other provinces.
China is currently conducting a massive year long campaign to quell the spread of the ETIM influence in the province.

Sensex down 112 points on profit-taking ahead of September month F&O expirySensex up 116 points; consumer durables, FMCG stocks steal the show
Our Bureau/Agencies
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the green amid weak European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex rose 116.32 points or 0.43 per cent at 27,206.74 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty gained 24.85 points or 0.31 per cent at 8,146.30.
Rajesh Agarwal, Head-Research, Eastern Financiers, in a report said: "Going forward, the Sensex earnings multiple at 17 times FY15 earnings looks a bit stretched, and investors would be better off being cautious as the near term upside looks a little difficult. Some reforms have taken place but the quantum of impact on the bottom-line of corporates needs to be seen. Hot money, lower crude prices, monsoon not turning out to be as bad as was earlier expected, are some of the factors that are driving the markets. While we believe that markets could witness correction in short-term, earnings expansion, government initiatives towards infrastructure and strengthening economic data, provide comfort on the medium-term. We strongly believe that the Government’s pro-growth approach will aid the revival in the economy and would in turn boost equity markets."
Among BSE sectoral indices, consumer durables, FMCG, auto and oil & gas indices were the star-performers and were up 3.12 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.88 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, metal index fell the most by 1.22 per cent, followed by healthcare 0.89 per cent and India infrastructure 0.87 per cent.
Tata Motors, ONGC, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and SBIN were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Cipla, BHEL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Infosys.
Concerns over a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday, while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners' shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 per cent, also took its toll.
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the weekend said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 347.48 at 10:02 a.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.6 per cent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts slid 0.5 per cent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.8 per cent.

UN chief Ban Ki-moon and Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio joined thousands of people for a march through the city to shine the spotlight on the climate crisis with the UN Chief stressing that there is no ‘Plan B’ to halt advance of climate change as there is no ‘Planet B.’
About 400,000 people participated in one of the largest global calls for climate action at the People’s Climate March here yesterday that also saw participation by NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, former US Vice President Al Gore, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, US Senator Chuck Schumer and musician Sting.

Speaking to journalists after walking in the rally, Ban said the world needs to “galvanize our action” and harness the people’s “power to change.”
He said the international community should adopt measures to halt the advance of global climate change as there is no “Plan B” for action as there is no “Planet B.”
The rally, which came just two days before Climate Summit at the UN Headquarters, saw politicians, celebrities, activists and the general public march though the city to highlight global concerns about a lack of international action to stop the deleterious effects of climate change.
The summit is expected to draw more than 120 heads of State and Government to galvanize action on climate change.
The People’s Climate March is part of a worldwide campaign to persuade global leaders to act decisively on the issue.
Similar climate events were reported in 2,000 locations around the world.
The march is campaigning, among other issues for curbs on harmful carbon emissions which contribute to global warming.
At last count, 2,129,060 people around the world had also signed a petition calling for world leaders to take bold action at the UN Climate Summit on September 23. The petition was handed over to the UN chief on the march route.
Chanting slogans and playing music, marchers created a noisy carnival atmosphere as they filed through Manhattan.

IT skilling company TalentSprint to now train teachers

(“The country needs 40-50 lakh new…)
NEW DELHI: TalentSprint, an IT and banking professional skilldevelopment company, is foraying into training teachers, the first such firm to do so, seeking to bridge the demand-supply gap in the nation's schools.
"The country needs 40-50 lakh new teachers in the next 10 years, which is simply a function of our burgeoning demographic dividend. At TalentSprint, we strongly felt the need to contribute to this sector in terms of talent development. There is a massive demand-supply gap in both government and private schools," said Santanu Paul, CEO and managing director. TalentSprint has set a goal of training 1 lakh school teachers to enter the education sector.
The company is backed by the National Skill Development Corporation, an agency formed under a public-private partnership to facilitate skill development in the country, and Nexus Venture Partners.
The company will conduct 150-200 hour certificate programmes aimed at enhancing the digital and soft skills of aspiring teachers who have completed their B.Ed course. Students will also be offered preparation for the Central Teacher Eligibility Test, which needs to be cleared by those seeking to teach in CBSE schools. According to Paul, the B.Ed curriculum isn't adequate for the 2.5 lakh teachers that India produces every year.
"The B.Ed programme does not cover digital and IT modules and those who have finished B.Ed also have to apply for CTET for getting employed in CBSE schools. Students are getting more tech-savvy and there's a need to train aspiring teachers on this front," said Paul. TalentSprint's course will offer training on spreadsheets, software presentation, browsing and Internet access, and knowledge of online learning resources.
It will include communication, writing and counselling skills. Students will get a TalentSprint and NSDC certificate at the end of the course. The company, which will partner with private schools for internship opportunities, will also offer the programme to contract teachers looking for permanent jobs.

China allows Kailash Mansarovar yatra via Nathula pass in SikkimChina allows Kailash Mansarovar yatra via Nathula pass in Sikkim

New Delhi, September 18:  
Indians travelling on the annual Kailash Manasarovar yatra will soon have another route, thanks to China agreeing to allow the yatra through the Nathula pass in Sikkim. The new route will pass through the city of Shigatse, which is part of the Tibetan Autonomous Region.
This new route will be in addition to the Lipulekh pass in Uttarakhand through which the yatra currently takes place.
A Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministries of External Affairs of India and China signed here on Thursday allows for the opening of the new route for Indian pilgrims to the Tibet Autonomous Region in the People’s Republic of China.
Addressing the media after the signing of the MoU, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the new route offers many benefits. “It makes Kailash Mansarovar accessible by a motorable road, which is especially beneficial for older pilgrims. It offers a safer alternative in the rainy season, makes the pilgrimage shorter in duration and will enable a much higher number of pilgrims to go there,” Modi said. The agreement was among the 12 inked after delegation-level talks between India and China here on Thursday.
China will be guest of honour country at the New Delhi World Book Fair 2016 something.
Pact with ISRO
An MoU between the Indian Space Research Organisation and the China National Space Administration will allow India and China to encourage exchange and cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, including research and development of scientific experiment satellites, remote sensing satellites and communication satellites.
The two countries have also agreed to enhance cooperation in the railway sector, including studying the feasibility of cooperation in a high-speed train as part of the MoU between the Ministry of Railways and Government of China on strengthening cooperation in Railways.

DAAWAT- E-ISHQ: A potent recipeSpecial arrangement WITHOUT ANY FRILLS Daawat-e-Ishq is a simple film with a progressive approach
Special arrangement A scene from Daawat-e-Ishq
TOPICS
Hindi cinema
Bollywood might have closed dowry case files but the social evil continues to raise its ugly head. No community or class can say that it is free from the malevolent practice. With “Dulha Bikta Hai” becoming a normal practice among the paying public, mainstream filmmakers who usually look for the unusual also lost interest.
Director Habib Faisal, who has knack for documenting social churning, updates us with the forms the human greed has taken in the society in the times of Facebook and 498A. Yes, the section of Indian Penal Code which empowers women to strike back in dowry cases. But are some of them using the tool to service their self interest? These are some of the concerns that Habib puts across in a cute little film that impresses with its progressive approach without turning into a lesson in moral science.
DAAWAT- E-ISHQ
Cast: Aditya Roy Kapoor, Parineeti Chopra, Anupam Kher
Director: Habib Faisal
Full of spunk Gulrez (Parineeti Chopra) lives with her clerk father (Anupam Kher) in a downtown Muslim neighbourhood in Hyderabad. Fed up of the dowry business, Gulrez decides to dupe unsuspecting boys with 498A to fund her American dream. Her honest father hesitates but ultimately gives in. They shift to Lucknow with a new identity. Among the proposals there is Tariq Haider (Aditya Roy Kapoor), whose cocky attitude and culinary business makes him an ideal candidate. But then the aroma of love spreads without notice and we are in for a delectable ride.
If you get down to the nuts and bolts, the narrative is reverse of Faisal’s “Ishaqzaade”. There the boy fell in love with the girl he was expected to torment and here the girl loses her heart to the boy she is eager to dupe but the storytelling and performances make the journey worth taking.
Written with a lot of care, the nuances in the dialect and the moments in father-daughter relationship entice us to suspend disbelief. Honest performance by Kher and Chopra ensures that there is never a manufactured moment between the two as Habib shows us a Muslim family of today’s India without making a show of it as some kind of Muslim social baulking under the pressure of customs and values. Gulrez has plans to move out form the ghettos to Jubilee hills. There is no Eid in the film but yes there is Holi in its diverse hues. It is this liberal tone that fills you with hope. One had doubts about Aditya transforming into a Lucknow lad but he doesn’t disappoint. The only concern is that after a point you know where it is headed and the songs don’t help in taking you away from the hows and whys. It is the food that plays that supporting part. Habib has a knack for bringing food into his stories and here he turns it into cupid. The use of culinary props is novel and the interplay of kababs and biryani is appetising. Indulge!
Bottomline: A relevant social message delivered in an entertaining fashion.

Young Indian architect named leader of tomorrow by Time magazineYoung Indian architect named ‘leader of tomorrow’ by Time magazine
PTI
Tweet
New York, Sept 20:  
A 28-year-old Indian architect has been named ‘young leader of tomorrow’ by Time magazine for his pioneering work in designing affordable flood-proof houses for slum-dwellers.
Alok Shetty is among “leaders of tomorrow” who are “working hard to change their worlds today’’, Time said as it named six inspirational young persons in its first class of “next generation leaders’’.
Time said Shetty is “building hope in India” as an architect who is “finding simple solutions to complex problems’’.
Shetty, working with the Bangalore-based non-profit Parinaam Foundation, is designing homes for hundreds of slum-dwellers whose makeshift houses flood during the heavy rains and become breeding grounds for diseases like malaria.
He has been working in Bangalore’s LRDE slum, which lies next to one of the southern Indian city’s sprawling technology parks and is home to some 2,000 people.
Shetty, who studied Master’s in Architecture at Columbia University, “came at the problem with an approach he brings to all of his projects — marrying smart design with a commitment to sustainability’’.
He designs flood-proof houses, costing $300, out of discarded scaffolding, bamboo and wood. The houses are affordable and easy to set up as it takes only four hours to erect and dismantle them.
Shetty is seeking government subsidies to bring down the prices further for those who cannot afford the units.
“Shetty epitomises a growing breed of young leaders and entrepreneurs in India who are committed to finding solutions for a country undergoing rapid social and economic changes, some of which can leave India’s poorest straggling behind,” Time said.
Another venture by is a plan to boost access to healthcare and education in remote communities.
“In my travels, I saw vast stretches of rural India where infrastructure for healthcare and education was severely underdeveloped,” he says in the Time report.
“Building facilities in these areas is not impossible but it is time-consuming. Adaptive architecture...can be an extremely effective solution to help address our developmental problems,” he said, adding that “often the simplest solutions are the best solutions.”

1L  and counting: TCS is now top employer of womenSave precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI: In a landmark for India Inc, the number of female employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has crossed the one-lakh mark, making it the country's biggest employer of women in the private sector. Women now comprise one-third of the IT major's 3.06 lakh workforce. This makes TCS, also the most valued company in India, one of the top employers of women in the technology sector globally. The top slot is held by IBM , which has an estimated 1.3 lakh women out of a workforce of 4.31 lakh.
In terms of market cap, the next two players in the domestic IT market are Infosys (54,537 women employees) and Wipro (45,276) but the female workforce of TCS is more than the two combined. The IT and BPO sector collectively employs about 3.1 million, of which nearly one million are women, according to industry body Nasscom .
The Mumbai-headquartered IT giant's achievement has also given a boost to the $103-billion Tata Group's female employee strength, which now stands at more than 1.4 lakh. "We have a lot of female talent in India, especially in the technology space. It's great to see that the company has been able to attract them. From 10,000 to 1,00,000, that is a growth of about 10x in 10 years," N Chandrasekaran , CEO and MD, TCS, told TOI.
In India, across companies and sectors, the gender ratio is undeniably skewed towards male employees. However, India Inc has been stepping up efforts to bridge the gap by implementing progressive policies and creating innovative solutions to hire, retain and encourage women talent. "Diversity challenges homogeneity in thinking, which is a good thing. There is no doubt that we want to be a rich and diverse organization," said the TCS boss. There have been several research reports which indicate that women think differently than men, and bring more empathy and intuition to leadership.
Within TCS, a major chunk —over 40 per cent — of its women employees are either new recruits or at junior levels, while about 11 per cent are in the senior management.
Though the tech giant has improved its gender diversity, it sees significant attrition after women rise to the mid-management level. To check this trend, the company has introduced steps like extended maternity leave options, flexi-work hours and onsite child-care facilities. It also has re-orientation courses that help women integrate seamlessly into the workforce on their return from a career break. Besides, it has mentoring programmes to groom women candidates with high potential for leadership roles.
"While the one lakh figure may sound good, it is important for me to create a mechanism that ensures women continue to pursue careers. Because women diversity comes down as you go higher," said Chandrasekaran. Women are scarce at the company's leadership rank and non-existent at the board level. The government mandates at least one woman director in listed companies like TCS by March 31, 2015.
Besides attrition, women's safety is another matter of concern. "We are creating emergency technology applications. We have also informed our employees to not leave alone in case they are working till late as a precautionary measure,'' said Chandrasekaran, who has set an internal target of zero incident. TCS has launched a safety app which automatically sends distress messages along with location details to a set of pre-designated contacts and also calls up one of them.

Five ways you can go for a course shift mid-careerassistant VP diversity
(With better opportunities…)
With better opportunities and entrepreneurial avenues opening up, the number of people wanting to break away from their existing careers has also been on the incline. Shreya Roy talks to experts to find out how to take the leap of faith and make a mid-life career change.
1) Choose your Change of Role well
After the decision to break out of your current mould has been made, one needs to be careful while choosing the new profile & industry. Research will tell you that there are professions which are harder to break into due to certain specifications. "Conduct a wide-ranging inspection on what interests you & then align it to an industry that has fewer barriers to entry," says Srimathi Shivashankar , assistant VP, diversity & sustainability, HCL Technologies .
2) Be Ready for Questions
"When you make a mid-career change, people are keen to know the reasons for it. So, make sure you have a good reason to provide, which is clear, and honest. More money is often a contributor, but hardly ever a good reason in these situations," says Rituparna Chakraborty , co-founder & senior vice-president, TeamLease Services.
3) Be Realistic & Evaluate all Aspects
Logically evaluate your financial situation and other practicalities that you will have to account for before and after you make the huge change. "It is important for you to be certain that you are not viewing a certain career in a different light because of a bias. You can make sure of this by having conversations with people who are in the field you've chosen to transition into," says Shivashankar.
4) Work on Developing Required Skills
An important consideration could be that you may need to get new certifications or develop a newer skill depending on your new role. "Being mentored by a senior, being flexible and open to change and having a strong networking practice with your peers is crucial, as social networking sites these days also look for candidates who have been referred," adds Shivashankar.
5) Don't be hasty about your choices
One of the big questions when making a career change is when to quit and start over. Don't be hasty with this choice and evaluate whether or not you need to quit immediately, or if you will be better off served by working on your aspirations simultaneously. "This will depend on what you want. If it is entrepreneurship that you are going for, then there is really no good or bad time. But to move to a different organisation, the timing is something you need to think through carefully, before leaving what you are doing," says Chakraborty.

World watches Mars Orbiter Missions quest for methaneWorld watches India's Mars Orbiter Mission’s quest for methane
20 Sep, 2014, 09.20AM IST
MAVEN will reach the Martian orbit on September 21, while MOM will be inserted into the orbit three days later.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BANGALORE: Is it time to plan human colonies on Mars like former Isro chairman U R Rao had once said? The idea seems far-fetched with the Red Planet still largely unexplored, notwithstanding several probes by many countries.
Scientists worldwide are considering the idea, and that's why they're keenly watching two Mars-bound spacecraft: India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) and the US' Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission.
MAVEN will reach the Martian orbit on September 21, while MOM will be inserted into the orbit three days later. MAVEN's primary objective will be to explore Mars' upper atmosphere, ionosphere and interactions with the sun and solar wind.
The Indian mission will be watched more closely, given that it's looking for methane, which could be proof of life. Nasa's 'Curiosity' was unable to detect methane. A S Kiran Kumar, associate director, Isro Space Application Centre, which developed the Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) had told TOI that once inserted into the designated orbit, MSM would pick up the methane absorption wavelength and measure the magnitude of methane up to the surface of the planet. "This method is different from that employed by Curiosity," he had said.
The International Space Exploration Co-ordination Group (ISECG), of which India is a member, is also keenly watching the event. While India would have won the battle once MOM enters the Martian orbit, the larger challenge would be to find methane.
Nasa, which is planning a manned mission to Mars in the future, says: "The formation and evolution of Mars are comparable to Earth, helping us learn more about our own planet's history and future. Mars had conditions suitable for life in its past. Future exploration could uncover evidence of life, answering one of the fundamental mysteries of the cosmos: Does life exist beyond Earth?"
Being India's first Mars shot, there have been several challenges and Isro seems to have overcome most of them so far. There has also been some criticism of whether a poor country like India should fund such a project. But the mission has been a dream, as Isro chairman K Radhakrishnan had put it during the launch last November. And, dreams are not bound by costs or other factors.

RBI Chief Frowns on  Subsidising  Foreign Education LoansManufacturing Growth May Moderate in December Quarter: Industry Body
Mumbai: Calling for a re-think on easy credit, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan has said banks are actually subsidising student education loans for overseas studies under the priority sector lending (PSL) segment.
"We actually subsidise, in the priority sector, student loans to study abroad. Are students studying abroad the most needy in the country or is it the most important?" Mr Rajan said in an address to bankers at an industry summit here last week.
"This is something people have got used to. I am not saying it is bad, but it is something you should ask questions about. We have to keep asking ourselves: Why should some sectors get more easy credit than others?" Mr Rajan said.
Under priority sector lending norms, banks are mandated to lend up to 40 per cent of their overall credit to marginalized sectors like agriculture, housing, small businesses and education.
Banks lend to such identified sectors as per their base rates and the shortfalls of the targets have to go to the low-yielding Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF).
Most banks, especially in the private sector, and overseas lenders generally fail to meet these targets. Even some state-run banks fail to meet this target due to lower number of branches.
Under the present norm, a loan of under Rs 20 lakh taken by an individual for studying abroad qualifies as priority sector lending.
As on September 15, the outstanding education credit, including for loans to study within the country and abroad, stood at Rs 57,902 crore , according to data from the apex bank.

Australia to prohibit secret service torturePrint
Associated Press | Canberra | Posted: September 22, 2014 10:04 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 10:07 am
The Australian government has bent to public pressure by proposing a specific prohibition on secret service officers torturing suspected terrorists.
The government had planned to indemnify Australian Security Intelligence Organization officers against all criminal offenses committed in the course of their undercover work except for homicide, causing serious injury, sexual assault and serious damage to property.
Attorney General George Brandis announced on Monday that torture would be added to that list, after the opposition and other critics complained that ASIO officers should not be protected from legal liability for torturing suspects.
Because torture was against Australian law, no operation involving torture could ever be authorized, Brandis said.
“I’ve decided to add an explicit prohibition in relation to torture in so far as concerns special intelligence operations,” Brandis told reporters.
“I want to stress there is absolutely no necessary legal reason to do this. I am doing so because it is something that ASIO is perfectly happy to have expressed on the face of the legislation and so as to avoid this debate being diverted by an issue that is nothing but a red herring.”
ASIO’s Secretary General Duncan Lewis, who took over Australia’s top domestic spy agency last week, said torture was contrary to Australia’s international obligations.
“The Australian Security Intelligence Organization has never practised torture, it does not practise torture and it never will,” Lewis said. “And for that reason, I’m perfectly happy that this addition is placed into the proposed legislation.”
George Williams, a University of New South Wales legal expert, said the amendment to specifically prohibit torture was necessary to prevent intelligence officers from being able to torture with impunity. The amendment legislation will be introduced to Parliament on Wednesday.
Williams, whose university has been studying Australian counterterrorism laws for several years, said some of the laws went too far.
He said the United States and Britain both had a higher terrorism threats than Australia, but neither country had the equivalent of Australia’s preventative detention orders. Under such orders, suspected terrorists can be held for up to 14 days without charge. The suspects aren’t allowed to disclose their whereabouts, even to family.
The orders, which were introduced in 2005, were used for the first time last week when police arrested 16 people during counterterrorism raids in Sydney. One man was charged with conspiring with an Islamic State movement leader in Syria to kidnap and behead a randomly selected person in Sydney. He remains in custody. Another three men were held under preventative detention orders, but have since been released.
A sunset clause means the legislation that created the orders will expire in December 2015.
The government had planned to make that legislation permanent. But Brandis said that after consultation with Muslim leaders, he had decided to include another 10-year sunset clause that will extend the legislation to 2025.
Australia raised its terror warning to the second-highest level two weeks ago in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of the Islamic State group.
Because torture was against Australian law, no operation involving torture could ever be authorized,

Siemens to buy Dresser-Rand in a $7.6 bn deal
Germany's Siemens said its USD 83 per-share bid was unanimously supported by Dresser-Rand's board of directors. That compares with a Friday closing price of USD 79.91, which was up 27 percent over the past three months on takeover speculation.

Industrial conglomerate Siemens AG said on Monday it would buy US oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand Group Inc for USD 7.6 billion in a move that would significantly boost the German company's oil and gas business in North America.
Germany's Siemens said its USD 83 per-share bid was unanimously supported by Dresser-Rand's board of directors. That compares with a Friday closing price of USD 79.91, which was up 27 percent over the past three months on takeover speculation.
Within minutes of that statement, it also announced the sale of its 50 percent stake in BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeraete GmbH to joint venture partner Robert Bosch GmbH for 3 billion euros (USD 3.85 billion), ending their more than 45 year alliance in household appliances.
"As the premium brand in the global energy infrastructure markets, Dresser-Rand is a perfect fit for the Siemens portfolio. The combined activities will create a world-class provider for the growing oil and gas markets," Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said in a statement on Monday.
Reuters reported on Sunday that the companies were nearing a deal.
The German industrial conglomerate had long coveted Dresser-Rand, which would help it grow its oil and gas business at a time when a North American fracking boom is boosting demand for energy equipment.
But it shrank in the past from making a formal bid, balking at its high valuation. Dresser-Rand trades at 24.6 times 12 month forward earnings, a 60 percent premium to its peers in oil and gas equipment and services, according to Reuters data.
CEO Kaeser said in July the company planned to focus on restructuring rather than acquisitions for the moment, but would have the financial firepower for the right acquisition target. Cash reserves stood at 8.21 billion euros at the end of June.
Siemens is targeting more than 150 million euros in annual synergies by 2019 from the transaction, which complements Siemens's market position in turbo compressors, downstream and industrial applications as well as larger-sized steam turbines.
Siemens expects to close the Dresser-Rand deal by summer 2015, while it aims to wrap up the sale of its stake in household appliance venture BSH with Bosch in first half of 2015.
BSH will pay out 250 million euros to each of its owners Bosch and Siemens before the transaction is completed.
Siemens has trumped a competing offer for Dresser-Rand from Swiss pump maker Sulzer AG, which had proposed an all-stock merger, according to people familiar with the matter.
Sulzer's chairman is former Siemens CEO Peter Loescher, who Kaeser replaced in a boardroom coup last year.
But other rival bidders may be lurking. General Electric was considering whether to make a bid, the Financial Times cited people familiar with the matter as saying on Friday. (http://on.ft.com/1tzUwLM)
Any GE involvement would mean their archrivalry picking up steam again. Siemens lost out to GE in a fierce bidding tussle over Alstom's energy business in June.
The Dresser-Rand deal would eclipse Siemens acquisitions over recent year. Siemens bought Dade Behring for $7 billion under Kaeser's predecessor Loescher in 2007, in a deal that was widely criticised as overpriced.
Siemens filled another gap in its energy equipment portfolio earlier this year, buying small gas-turbine assets from Rolls-Royce for 950 million euros. CEO Kaeser indicated at the time that expansion in the United States was next on the agenda.

Apple iPhone 6  iPhone 6 Plus more durable than Samsung Galaxy S5: Tests31
1
New York: Apple's new and bigger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are more durable than last year's model and a leading Android phone, a study says.
Apple's iPhone 6, whose screen measures 4.7 inches, did the best across a variety of tests that measures how prone smartphones are to break due to everyday accidents, according to SquareTrade, a company that provides extended protection plans.
The iPhone Plus 6, whose screen measures 5.5 inches, wasn't far behind but lost points because it could slip out of a person's hand since some users may have a hard time gripping its large but slim form, SquareTrade says.
Apple's iPhone 6 did the best across a variety of tests that measures how prone smartphones are to break due to everyday accidents.
#apple #iphone 6 #iphone 6 plus #samsung galaxy s5
The iPhone 5s, which measures 4 inches and came out last year, fared better than Samsung's Galaxy S5, which measures 5.1 inches. The Samsung phone got poor marks on several tests including the slide test. The more a phone slides, the greater its chance of falling off the edge of a table.
Still, all four of the smartphones tested had a medium risk of breakage and had no drastic differences among them.
"The phones are getting more and more durable," says Ty Shay, chief marketing officer at SquareTrade. "Manufacturers are paying more attention."
SquareTrade examines the phones based on eight factors, including size, weight, grip and the quality of the front and back panels. The company measured how far the phones slide when pushed across a table on their backs and how well they withstand drops from 4 feet and being dunked in water for 10 seconds.
SquareTrade says it uses robots to do the testing to ensure consistency, and rates the phones on a 10-point durability scale, with 10 signifying the highest risk. Apple's iPhone 6 scored the best at 4; the iPhone 6 Plus scored a 5; the iPhone 5s a 6; and Samsung Galaxy S5 a 6.5.
Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus passed the slide test, but the iPhone 5s and Samsung Galaxy's S5 got poor marks in that area. The iPhone 6 Plus was the only one that didn't fare as well when dropped 4 feet by the robot. The glass screen survived, but the case separated from the glass. All four phones fared well in the water resistance test.
SquareTrade provided The Associated Press with the results ahead of Monday's announcement.
Aside from larger screens, the new Apple iPhones 6 and 6 Plus announced this month promises faster performance and offers a wireless chip for making credit card payments at stores by holding the phone near the payment terminal.
The phones start at $199 with a two-year service contact. The new iPhones initially were available this month in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK Availability is expanding to more than 20 additional countries.

2 killed  many injured in explosions in China s XinjiangPress Trust of India | Beijing | Posted: September 22, 2014 10:43 am
At least two persons were killed and several others injured in a series of explosions in China’s restive Muslim-dominated Xinjiang province.
Explosions hit at least three locations in Xinjiang’s Luntai County Sunday evening, the Tianshan news portal, run by the regional government, said in a short report Monday morning.
The report did not identify the explosions, which appeared to be coordinated attacks, as acts of terrorism, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.
“The local social order was normal,” the Tianshan said, indicating that there was no further unrest following the explosions.
An unspecified number of those wounded have been admitted to hospitals, the report said.
Investigations were ongoing, the Post said.
Photos in Weibo, akin Twitter in China, showed smoke billowing out in two locations with widespread damage to the vehicles.
More than half of the county’s 113,000 residents are ethnic Uygurs, according to local census information.
A series of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang shocked China this year, with the latest in early August when 37 civilians were killed and another 13 injured in Shache County of Kashgar Prefecture.
China blames the attacks on East Turkestan Islamic Movement, an al-Qaeda backed organisation active in Xinjiang province where the native Muslim Uygurs were restive over the increasing settlements of Hans from other provinces.
China is currently conducting a massive year long campaign to quell the spread of the ETIM influence in the province.

Maharashtra polls: Don t break alliance  BJP urges Shiv Sena as deadlock on seat sharing continues10

New Delhi: As allies Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena refuse to budge over seat sharing for Maharashtra Assembly elections attempts are on to save the alliance. BJP President Amit Shah on Monday called up Shiv Sena chhief Uddhav Thackeray and urged him not to break the 25-year-old alliance.
This comes a day after the Shiv Sena had made a final seat sharing offer to BJP under which the latter gets to contest 119 seats as opposed to its demand for 130 seats. The saffron brigade had rejected the offer and rumours were abuzz that the parties which share the 'Hindutva agenda' might just call it quits.
Sources in the BJP told CNN-IBN that the party was mulling to fight the crucial elections alone if Sena refused to give its demanded number of seats.
This comes a day after the Shiv Sena had made a final seat sharing offer to BJP under which the latter gets to contest 119 seats as opposed to its demand for 130 seats.
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #shiv sena #bjp #elections
To this, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said, "They (BJP) should remember they are not givers but takers on this land. I will be saddened if the alliance breaks."
The BJP has demanded around 130 seats and wanted Sena to contest on 140 seats. But Sena has made it clear that it would contest on at least 150 seats and has also communicated that the BJP could not widen its base at Sena's cost. The BJP insisted that they want Sena to discuss on 59 seats that it has never won.
As the BJP gets into a huddle to solve it's biggest crisis in Maharashtra, Thackeray has sent across two messages - Sena was not the one that was breaking the alliance and they were fully prepared to contest alone, if need be.

Seeing business, Gujaratis flock to learn Chinese languages

Ahmedabad: With Gujarat hoping to boost trade ties with China after President Xi Jinping's recent visit, more are more Gujaratis are thronging institutes imparting training in various foreign languages especially to learn Chinese with a view to explore business opportunities in the neighbouring country.
Several pacts were inked between the two countries when President Xi visited Gujarat during his three-day India tour. This included an agreement of sister city pact between Guangzhou in China and Gujarat's mega city Ahmedabad besides a deal on setting up of an industrial park in the state.
The people of Gujarat did not wait for such events to happen and had already started sensing business opportunities in the land of Mao Zedong earlier. But according to city-based teachers and students of Chinese language, the trend to learn Chinese recently got a big push after Xi's visit.

"There is an increasing trend amongst Gujaratis to learn Chinese languages. The trend emerged rapidly, during the last two years after China and Gujarat began new business relations due to initiatives taken by state's former Chief Minister and present Prime Minister Narendra Modi," a city-based teacher of Chinese languages, Lavanya Trivedi said.
Trivedi claims that business personnel, medical students and interior designers are front runners to learn Chinese so that they can establish themselves in the People's Republic of China.
"There are more than 60 students, who are learning the Chinese language Mandarin, in various city-based institutes. As per the current trend, businessmen, medicos and interior designers dominate the numbers," Trivedi said.
She said that Chinese interior designers are quite in demand in Gujarat which could be the reason why the interior designers from the state often deal with China.

Rajasthan: Police find minister s puppy first  get criticised for delay in gangrape probe27

Jaipur: A Rajasthan minister's missing pet dog has been traced, much to the relief of local police which was in the line of fire for launching a hunt for the pup at a time when it is yet to crack the shocking gangrape case in the city.
A missing complaint was filed with Sodala Police Station on Sunday when the five month-old puppy was not found in the bungalow of Health Minister Rajendra Rathore since Saturday and the police started a search.
A local man brought the animal to the residence of Rathore this morning and handed over to the staff, saying he had picked him from the road during a morning walk on Sunday.
A missing complaint was filed with Sodala Police Station on Sunday.

"The puppy had gone out of the house on Saturday and was picked by the old man. He inquired nearby but no one claimed ownership so he took the puppy with him and was thinking of leaving the puppy at an animal shelter, but he came to know about the owner (the minister) through newspapers and brought him to us this morning," a staffer at the minister's residence said.
The police, which was engaged in search of the dog named Charlie of Beagle breed, refused to comment on the matter. Congress targeted the police for failing to search the robbers who raped a woman and robbed her family in Vaishali Nagar on Friday and burglars who targeted a locked house on Saturday.
"Such big crimes happened in the state capital but the police was busy in searching the dog on Sunday. This is shameful," PCC Spokesperson Archana Sharma said.

New Android One smartphones may hit the Indian market by December

New Delhi: Enthused by the initial response to Google's Android One, handset makers Karbonn, Spice and Intex are gearing up for round two with a slew of smartphone launches beginning December this year. The first set of Android One devices were launched last week, priced Rs 6,299 onwards by Micromax, Karbonn and Spice.
Karbonn is expected to be among the first ones to launch newer Android One devices in the country. "Smartphone penetration in India still remains low and we believe there is still a huge scope...We will look at bringing in a device by December-end," Karbonn Mobiles Executive Director Shashin Devsare told PTI.
India is the first country where the US-based firm's Android One devices have been launched.
Handset makers Karbonn, Spice and Intex are gearing up for round two with a slew of smartphone launches beginning December this year.

Similarly, Spice is also looking at unveiling its second Android One smartphone in the January-March quarter of next year, its Chairman and Group CEO Dilip Modi said.
"Our intent is to offer consumers a wide variety of products packed with features across various price points. We already have one of the most affordable smartphones with Firefox and we will continue to bring affordable devices to the market," he added.
Google is rolling out the programme, which aims to bring affordable smartphone to the masses, across other markets like Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka will follow in the coming months.
It has also included new partners including Acer, Alcatal OneTouch, HTC, Asus and Lenovo, along with Indian brands like Xolo, Lava and Intex to bring in devices with various specifications across price points.
By associating with Google as part of the Android one ecosystem, Intex will offer customers an enhanced experience, something unique in terms of design, pricing and functionality, Intex Business Head (Mobile) Sanjay Kalirona said.
"We are actively working on bringing out the device to the market. It takes about 3-4 months for any final product to be made available in the market," Kalirona said but declined to comment on when the device would hit the market. However, sources said Intex could unveil its device by January next year.
Analysts feel Android One will lead a fiercer competition in the mid-range smartphone market with firms offering better experience at price points in the range of Rs 6,000-10,000. While the initial launch of the Android One handsets was done in partnership with eCommerce firms Snapdeal, Amazon and Flipkart, the handset makers would sell them through brick and mortar stores as well, which will further fuel competition.
According to research firm IDC, Micromax, Karbonn and Lava (top 5 vendors among total shipment as well as smartphone sales) together accounted for over 30 per cent of the market (in both cases).

Fraudulent schemes have some common features. If you come across any of these, stay on guard
SEBI’s recent investigations have shown us that Ponzi schemes could be lurking anywhere — NCDs, preference shares, livestock rearing, plantations and even harmless sounding time-shares. So, if you want to avoid being reeled into a Ponzi scheme, what should you watch out for?
Here are some features that should set the alarm bells ringing as they were common to many of the schemes pulled up by SEBI.
Not listed
Every illegal fund-raiser hauled up by SEBI has originated from an unlisted firm. Being unlisted allows the promoters of dubious schemes to offer sketchy financial information and bypass regulatory filings of a prospectus and financial results. So, be doubly suspicious if the issuer is unlisted.
Celebrity endorsements
They don’t have disclosures but they do have celebrities plugging for them. The Sahara group was the sponsor of the entire Indian cricket team until recently, Rose Valley (a CIS) sponsored Kolkata Knight Riders and the Pearls group was endorsed by Kings XI Punjab.
Sportspersons or celebrities are not financial advisors; so don’t go by their recommendations.
No paperwork
Forget an offer document. Most of the illegal fund-raisers claimed that they didn’t even have official brochures or product literature for their plans, they relied mainly on highly-paid field agents to hard-sell their schemes. Most of these schemes, when probed by SEBI, also said they didn’t maintain even basic documentation about the names and addresses of all their investors and their addresses.
So, if there’s no paperwork, there’s probably something fishy.
Cash payments
A demand for investments to be made in hard cash usually means the firm isn’t going to compile or share information with the taxman or regulators. Today, most regulated investments require you to not just pay through cheque or demand draft but also produce a PAN card to prove your ID. Incidentally, SEBI has specifically barred CIS, even if they are genuine, from accepting cash contributions from investors.
Assured returns
Paper certificates and verbal assurances of returns mean nothing, if the firm has no intention of honouring its promises. So, if a firm is guaranteeing a return, it is up to you to find out what backs that guarantee. Does the firm have the net worth or assets to fulfil the guarantee, if the investment flops?
If the returns touted by a scheme seem too good to be true, it usually spells Ponzi.

Apple to unveil new iPads  OS on October 21Apple to unveil new iPads, operating system on Oct 21: Report
Anya George Tharakan     Bangalore   Last Updated: September 18, 2014  | 11:35 IST
Apple Inc is set to launch two new iPads and release the next version of its Mac operating system at its next event on October 21.
A report by Daily Dot, citing sources familiar with the matter, said Apple plans to unveil the sixth generation of its iPad and the third edition of the iPad mini, as well as its operating system OS X Yosemite, which has undergone a complete visual overhaul.
Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment.
Bloomberg had earlier reported that the new iPad is expected to have a 9.7-inch screen while the new version of the iPad mini will have a 7.9-inch screen.
Another report by the agency has said the California-based company will launch its next generation of iPads around mid-October as Apple prepares for the holiday season by boosting its product lineup .
Apple has already unveiled its Apple Watch, two larger iPhones and a mobile payments service dubbed "Apple Pay" last week.
The Tim Cook-led company sold 13.3 million iPads in the quarter ended June, falling short of analysts' projections for more than 14 million.

Rupee logs 3rd day of gains on bullish equitiesForex update: Rupee ends 8 paise up, logs third day of gains on strong equities
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 18, 2014  | 18:43 IST

The rupee extending gains for third straight day to close eight paise higher at 60.84 against the Greenback following late dollar selling by exporters and bullish local stocks, extending gains for third straight day.
The domestic unit washed out all of its initial losses and came off from one-month intra-day low of 61.2050.
Fall in dollar value abroad against its major rivals also helped the rupee recovery from early losses. The dollar index, a gauge of six major global units, was down by 0.25 per cent on Thursday.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic currency resumed weak at 61.09 a dollar from previous close of 60.92 and dropped further to a one-month intra-day low of 61.2050 -level not seen since August 13, 2014 when it had touched a low of 61.30.
It later bounced back to a high of 60.8350 on strong rally in local stocks before concluding at 60.84, displaying a rise of eight paise or 0.13 per cent.
On Wednesday, the American unit extended gains versus the Japanese yen and the euro after the US Federal Reserve renewed its pledge to keep interest rates near zero for a "considerable time", giving relief to emerging markets, including the domestic market on receding fears of immediate pull out by foreign funds.
Renewed buying by foreign funds in local equities too aided the rupee rise. FPIs/FIIs, after selling shares worth US $120.70 million on Tuesday, picked up shares worth US $29.29 million on Wednesday, as per data released by capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of india (Sebi).
The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex on Thursday zoomed by 480.92 points or 1.81 per cent to end  at a one-week high.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO, said, "Rupee continues to trade strong for the third day and appreciated taking cues from strong local equities. Local indices surged on positive global sentiments after US Fed stated that rate hikes would not happen for a "considerable time."
"After yesterday's gain dollar index is also trading slightly weak for the day at US $84.51 which further helped Rupee to trade strong. The trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 60.50 to 61.30," he added.
The rupee had earlier hit an intra-day low after dovish Fed comments, but regained back over the optimism of trade ties with China, according to India Forex Advisors.
In the forwards market on Thursday, premium continued its south bound journey on sustained receipts by exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in February dipped to 221.5-223.5 paise from previous close of 227-229 paise and far-forward contracts maturing in August, 2015 also dropped to 475-477 paise from 480.5-482.5 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.0558 and for the euro at 78.5727.
The rupee softened further against the pound to 99.41 from 99.35 previously while improved further to 78.37 per euro from 78.93. It hardened to 55.98 per 100 Japanese yen from 56.76.

Gold price hits 14-month low  dips below 27k levelGold price hits 14-month low, dips below 27k level
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 20, 2014  | 18:04 IST
Extending its losses, gold prices on Saturday dipped below the Rs 27,000-mark by losing Rs 40 to trade at about 14-month low of Rs 26,970 per ten gram in the national capital on sustained selling by stockists amid a weak global trend.
Besides, slackened demand from jewellers too weighed on the precious metal prices.
Silver also remained under pressure for the fourth straight day and slumped by Rs 1,275 to Rs 39,625 per kg on poor offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Sentiments remained bearish as gold tumbled to an eight-month low in global markets as equities surged to a record, dampening demand for the precious metal as an alternative asset, traders said
Gold in New York, which normally determines price trend on the domestic front, fell 0.8 per cent to $1,216.60 an ounce and silver fell 3.6 per cent to $17.84 and ounce.
In addition, strengthening of rupee against the dollar that made the import of precious metals cheaper and shifting of funds toward soaring equities too influenced the sentiment, they said.
Meanwhile, the rupee edged up to end at one-week high of 60.81 against the dollar.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity declined further by Rs 40 to Rs 26,970 and Rs 26,770 per ten gram respectively, a level last seen on July 10 last year. The yellow metal had tumbled by Rs 440 in last trade.
Sovereign plunged by Rs 200 to Rs 24,200 per piece of eight gram.
Silver ready nosedived by Rs 1,275 to Rs 39,625 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 1,110 to Rs 39,700 per kg. The white metal had lost Rs 700 in the previous three sessions.
Silver coins, however, held steady at Rs 70,000 for buying and Rs 71,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Hope to be first in Asia to reach Mars in 1st shotISRO
(Mars Orbiter Mission will…)
India's 50-year-old space odyssey will start a new chapter this week when an indigenously built spacecraft — affectionately called MOM (Mars Orbiter Mission) — attempts to enter the orbit around the Red Planet after a 680-million-km journey. The orbiting mission will take pictures and collect scientific data for about six months. The most nail-biting phase will begin early Wednesday when it executes the crucial Mars orbit insertion, a stage at which most missions have failed. Isro chairman K Radhakrishnan speaks about the challenge ahead.
With 72 hours left for the crucial Mars orbit insertion, how do you describe the level of anxiety among your colleagues?
There is no question of nervousness or tension. We have to stay cool and be prepared for any contingency.
How optimistic are you about the success of the mission?
We have done everything to make sure it succeeds. The spacecraft's propulsion system will play a major role during its entry to Mars. For this purpose we have tested the 440N liquid apogee motor for prolonged periods under a simulated environment and it performed flawlessly. But, then it has to restart in a real Martian environment on Wednesday. This will be a major challenge. To check on the state of this engine we will fire it for a mere four seconds at 2.30pm on Monday. If this is successful our team will have a high level of confidence about the orbit insertion. The spacecraft and its five payloads are in good health and checked regularly.
What happens if by chance the liquid apogee motor fails during Monday's small test?
Then we will be activating Plan B, which means firing only the eight thrusters of the spacecraft. For the Mars capture, the speed of the spacecraft has to come down from 22.1km per second to 4.4km per second in relation to Mars.
Your team has mixed feelings about Plan B because some believe that it could compromise the profile of the mission.
The implementation of Plan B will result in a new and larger orbit as the eight thrusters will fire for a longer period of time. I will not be disappointed because it is possible some new science may come out of it. Let's just wait and watch. Basically, our mission is to demonstrate that we have the capability to capture the Martian orbit and once this happens on Wednesday we can declare we have been successful. We will be the first Asian nation to have reached Mars in the first shot itself.
This is the cheapest mission at $71 million (Rs 450 crore). Even 'Gravity', the space film, cost $100 million. You also fast-tracked the project in a record 15 months. How did Isro accomplish this?
The rocket was already ready -the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle -so that saved both money and time. Also, some of the spacecraft's sub-systems were similar to those used by other spacecraft. These were some key factors that contributed to making it an inexpensive mission. Also, labour costs are low in India. As for the fast-tracking, all I can say is our team of young, dedicated scientists slogged almost 24x7 to achieve it.
  Two spacecraft will arrive at Mars almost simultaneously — Nasa's $671-million Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission on Monday and India's MOM two days later. Will there be any collaboration between the two?
There is a lot of contact between scientists of the two space agencies. Nasa's three ground stations at Goldstone in California, Madrid in Spain and Canberra in Australia have backed our mission and will monitor our orbit insertion. Since there will be complementary data from the two missions, scientists from both countries will collaborate to evaluate the information.
How will this Wednesday change how India looks at space research and science in general?
The entire nation has been with us on this mission and its success will make every Indian proud. It will also help inspire the younger generation take up science, technology, math and engineering.

PM Modi passionate about the solar mission: Piyush GoyalNarendra Modi
(The finance minister in…)
Piyush Goyal, minister of state (independent charge) for power, coal and new and renewable energy, concedes subsidy-based solar and wind energy schemes have their inherent limitations, and the government is mulling over some interventions to bring the sector to a more market-driven platform. While talking to ET Magazine, Goyal said prime minister Narendra Modi is "passionate" about the solar mission, and that a number of big foreign companies are showing interest has vindicated the government's position on the renewable sector. Excerpts:
Till now, new and renewable energy has been more subsidy-driven than market-driven. Are you proposing to change that?
All studies have shown that in the long run renewable energy is the most attractive way to generate power. More particularly because it addresses energy security issues. You don't have to depend on fuel, import, shortages, transport etc. Here the benevolence of God, that is the sun and wind, takes care of a part of operating costs. If you take the lifecycle costs in this sector and map them in parity with other conventional energy, investors here get a fair return. A lot of the cost here is interest.
I am trying to see if the subsidy regime is changed from capital subsidy to interest subvention. After all, subsidy-based schemes will have their limitations. If we increase the capacity, based on subsidy, there will be many more restrictions and constraints. Also, I was saddled with Rs 3,000-odd crore of subsidy when I took charge [as the minister]. There is no money for this. And there is another commitment of about Rs 9,000 crore. That was the clean energy fund money which was collected to fund renewable energy but was spent to bridge the fiscal deficit. So, we have a huge liability, and there is nothing in the bank. I have no choice but to pay off the liability, but for the future we are looking at the lifecycles. For example, investments on solar could be highly attractive for a period of 15, 20 or 25 years. And then comes the political part. We are stepping in here to ensure low-cost funding and bankability of power-purchasing pacts so that buyers can't back off after getting cheap power for an initial period.
Do you get a sense that bigger companies may like to invest in new and renewable energy?
Subsequent to bringing back the accelerated depreciation, which two and half years ago was summarily withdrawn, there is more interest in the wind sector now. The finance minister in his budget did justice to the new and renewable sector in several ways, including duty concessions and tax breaks for a longer period.
Are bigger companies coming forward?
I am getting excellent response from a number of companies including those from Australia, Japan and the US. I don't wish to tell you the names of those companies, but they are excited about the prospects in this sector.
  But domestic solar manufacturers seem to be unhappy over your decision not to impose anti-dumping duties. Isn't the decision a setback for Indian manufacturers?
The whole world knows that the prime minister is very passionate about the solar mission. But any anti-dumping duties (on imports of solar panels from countries such as US and China) would have killed the mission, particularly when domestic manufacturers can't produce significant volumes and most of them are in dire straits. The last government on May 22 (four days before the new government assumed charge) took the decision of imposing anti-dumping duties. As a party or as an ideology, we are committed to encourage domestic manufacturers. We want Made-In-India products to be more competitive. To resolve the issue, I had a six-hour-long meeting with the solar manufacturers.
I wanted to understand their problems. At the end of six hours, we came to a very good understanding that domestic industry has to flourish. I want them to get world-class technology so that they get economies of scale. But at the same time, in the short-run, since they are not able to do that I want imports to take place. And they have no problem in that. As long as they get enough business opportunities and help to get competitive, they said they have no problems. The manufacturers themselves withdrew anti-dumping duties requests.

Scotland independence vote: Not an isolated instanceAustralia
(Referendum was closely…)
Scotland said "No" and decided to stay with the United Kingdom a couple of days ago. The referendum was closely watched by people and politicians across the world. However, this isn't the first time that people have chosen to determine their destiny using direct democracy. Here's a look at times countries and people have voted to indicate what they want:
The Oz national song
Imagine a bunch of Aussies singing their national song. Imagine them singing "God save the Queen". Doesn't fit, no? But that's what the rambunctious folks Down Under did till 1974, when they conducted a survey to determine what would be their national song. "Advance Australia Fair" topped the list. But, it was not until 1977 that "Advance Australia Fair" was chosen in a plebiscite as the official anthem beating other popular numbers like "Waltzing Matilda", "Song of Australia" and "God save the Queen".
A referendum against minarets
The Swiss voted in November 2009 to decide on this topic of crushing importance: should Swiss cities ban minarets or not? The government urged the public to vote against the ban but the people voted for the ban. Believe it or not, minarets are banned in Switzerland!
Rigging of book prices
Another golden one from the land of referendums. A 2012 referendum sought to fix book prices, so that everybody could read them. Nobody thought of the publishers. Fortunately, good sense prevailed and most people voted against it.
Holidays for all
This 2012 referendum makes you wish you held a Swiss passport. The Swiss trade union, Travail Suisse, wanted every Swiss employee to get six weeks of mandatory vacations each year instead of four. Businesses argued against it saying it would lead to higher wage costs. The proposal was defeated.
What's in a town's name?
Aracataca is a small town in Colombia. It's best known for being Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez's birthplace. It's the town from which he drew inspiration for his fictional town of Macondo in his One Thousand Years of Solitude. In June 2006, a referendum was held to rename it Aracataca-Macondo. It failed due to low turnout.

The economy  stupid  behind Scotland s  No  vote: PollThe "No" campaign focused on the economic dangers of independence, in particular warning of uncertainty over the currency. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: Scots were driven to reject independence in a historic referendum more out of fears over the economic risks of going alone than a strong attachment to the United Kingdom, a survey analysis shows.
The post-referendum survey by independent pollster Lord Michael Ashcroft also reveals that young people voted in droves to break up the centuries-old union - suggesting that a future referendum might go the other way.
The "No" campaign focused on the economic dangers of independence, in particular warning of uncertainty over the currency after the British government said the separatists would not be able to keep the pound.
Ashcroft's survey of 2,047 people who cast ballots in Thursday's referendum, weighted to reflect the 55 per cent who voted against independence, reveals that the message hit home.
When "No" voters were presented with three options explaining their decision, some 47 per cent said the risks were too great when it came to matters such as the currency, EU membership, the economy , jobs and prices.
Around 27 per cent said they were driven by a strong attachment to the United Kingdom, its shared history, culture and traditions.
And around 25 per cent said it was the promise of new powers for the devolved Scottish Parliament that would result in "the best of both worlds".
By contrast, "by far the biggest single driver for 'Yes' voters was disaffection with Westminster politics", said Ashcroft, a former Conservative party donor, in an online commentary.
Seven in 10 "Yes" voters said they were most concerned that decisions about Scotland be taken in Scotland, while 20 per cent said they were driven by the feeling that the future would be brighter as an independent country.
One in 10 said their main reason for backing independence was to ensure they would no longer be ruled by Conservative governments.
British Prime Minister David Cameron's party is currently the biggest in Westminster but has just one Scottish MP.
Warnings that independence was the only way to save the state-run National Health Service (NHS) from savage spending cuts also made their mark, with 54 per cent of "Yes" voters saying it was an important factor.
After a slow burning campaign that reached a frenzy in the last fortnight when opinion polls suggested the "Yes" camp might deliver a shock win, two-thirds of those who made up their minds in the last few days voted "Yes".
Despite the clear result, the survey indicates that the issue of independence has not been decided for good.
Some 71 per cent of 16- to 17-year-olds, who were allowed to vote for the first time in a British election, voted "Yes", while 73 per cent of people over 65 voted "No".
And although Cameron said the issue of independence had now been settled for a generation, many voters believe the referendum may be re-run sooner.
Some 31 per cent said the issue was settled for five years, 17 per cent for a decade, 24 per cent for a generation - while 19 per cent said independence would never be revisited.
The respondents were interviewed by telephone and online.

After Scotland votes 'no', focus shifted to maximum devolution
Sudeshna Sen, ET Bureau Sep 20, 2014, 04.00AM IST

maximum devolution
(The details will need all-party…)
The question facing the country now is Devo Max - short for maximum devolution - a proposal cobbled together by all key political parties except Alex Salmond's SNP, to promise Scotland far-reaching powers of self-governance, as early as 2015
It isn't the end of the British Empire, after all. In a historic referendum that captured global imagination, Scotland voted 55:45 to keep the Kingdom United, and not break up a 307-year-old union.
The modern day war for independence, fought with TV debates, campaigning, social media and propaganda on either side, finally ended with a larger majority for the 'No' campaign than polls suggested.
The referendum may have, for a generation or even a lifetime, settled the question of Scotland's sovereignty, but might forever change the way the United Kingdom is governed, and eventually lead to it becoming a federal union, with England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland with each taking their own decisions on taxation, benefits and local laws.
The country is facing what, commentators say, could be the biggest constitutional crisis in centuries, and there is no clarity on how this goes forward. The key question facing the country now is Devo Max - short for maximum devolution - a proposal cobbled together by all key political parties except Alex Salmond's SNP, to promise Scotland far-reaching powers of self-governance, as early as 2015.
The deal, announced by former PM Gordon Brown just before the vote, set out a timetable to decide on devolution of more powers to Scotland. Alex Salmond, who before the vote pooh-poohed the peace offering, has now said he intends to ensure every promise is carried out, and is going to aim for almost complete autonomy within the framework of the UK.
Just after the vote, David Cameron announced that the highly-respected Lord Kelvin, former governor of the BBC, has been given the job of ensuring the plans come to fruition.
Unfortunately, the details will need all-party agreement, a tough job, given that none of the major parties are in agreement about what exactly these enhanced powers should be.
In a move meant to pacify an irate England - and his own Tory party dissidents - Cameron also announced that William Hague will be in charge of working on a plan to give similar powers to Wales, Northern Ireland and England. The "west Lothian" question, in which Scottish MPs can vote on English affairs but English MPs can't vote on Scottish affairs, will be addressed, and Cameron intends to ensure that English MPs have the same autonomy as Scotland or Wales.
If the referendum divided the fabric of Scottish society, it also inflicted deep wounds in Scottish-English relation, wounds that will take years to heal. As per a prior formula known as the Barnett rules, Scotland gets more money to spend per capita from the national kitty than England does, and already enjoys a fair amount of autonomy.
The English voter, naturally, isn't pleased that more of his tax money should benefit the Scots after Devo Max. As Cameron pointed out, "We need to hear millions of English voices as well."
Politically, the United Kingdom still faces a long period of political uncertainty, and the fact that general elections are due next year adds a serious twist to the tale - in the run-up to elections, parties are hardly likely to "cooperate" about changing the powers of their own MPs.

Consumer Durable Makers Using Social Media for Festive Campaigns
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 21, 2014 19:19 (IST)
Sebi Bars Transgene Chief, 5 Officials From Capital Markets
New Delhi: LG, which is looking at a 35 per cent jump in sales during the festival season, is spending 50 per cent more than last year on marketing and branding.
On being asked whether his company would give prominence to digital platforms in its marketing campaigns, Haier India president Eric Braganza said, "Absolutely, since the world has moved online, we plan to reach our consumers where they actually are."
Whirlpool of India, which is targeting women in the age bracket of 25-44 is also leveraging the digital platform though its main focus would be on TV and Print.
"Our new TV campaign will be uploaded in YouTube and Facebook and our promotional details will also be communicated through social media. However, our main communication medium, because of reach, will be TV and Print," Whirlpool of India vice president-corporate affairs and strategy Asia South Shantanu Dasgupta said.
Whirlpool of India is spending Rs 12 crore during the festive period.
Haier is targeting customers in the age bracket of 20-40 years and is running a combination of offline and online offers.
"The offline offer promises exciting assortment of assured gifts and extended warranty, while the online part of the offer is 'Play Higher, Win Haier' campaign where the consumer will get an opportunity to win jackpot prizes by participating in the online offer on Haier India Facebook page," Mr Braganza said.
It has launched an online campaign utilising Facebook in which consumers get a scratch card on purchase of a Haier product with a unique code. In order to win a prize, customers then have to enter the code on its Facebook page and get a chance to turn the slot and save/lock the highest number according to them.
With festive season around the corner, consumer durable makers such as LG, Panasonic, Whirlpool and Haier are going beyond traditional routes of marketing campaigns by using social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube to tap young customers.
Apart from running special campaigns of ATL (above the line) and BTL (below the line) activities such as print, outdoor, shop-front and events, makers are also targeting the 20-40 years age bracket through various social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube.
Panasonic, which is incurring over Rs 85 crore on the branding during the festive seasons, aims to spend a significant portion of that on the new media.
"Panasonic is making optimum use of all the available mediums to promote the festive offers and social media is an essential part of it. A significant part of our marketing budget for festive offer is spent on digital promotion," Panasonic India managing director Manish Sharma told PTI.
South Korean maker LG is seeing social media and digital platforms as an important mode for its campaign during the festive period.
"Digital medium will be an important platform for festive campaigns. We always try our best to engage consumers through innovative digital campaigns," LG India head-corporate marketing Sanjay Chitkara said.

Tax Benefits to Help FPIs Adopt Algo-Trading in Big Way: ExpertsThe Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
New Delhi: As a liberal tax regime kicks in for overseas investors from next fiscal year, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are expected to expand their activities in Indian markets by using the high-frequency trading technology, according to experts.
High frequency trading, also known as algorithmic trading or algo-trading), refers to the automated execution of trades on the stock markets through pre-programmed software platforms installed on servers. The same is becoming popular in India.
While currently only a few FPIs have adopted algo-trading, many more are expected to take it up, consultancy PwC said.
To improve ease of doing business and for better regulatory oversight, capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) created a new FPI category after pooling together different categories of overseas investors such as FIIs, their sub-accounts and qualified foreign investors (QFIs).
According to PwC, there has been low FPI participation in algo-trades so far, mainly because of the ambiguity related to characterisation of their income as 'business income' or 'capital gains'.
"If their income is treated as business income, FPIs could have been taxable at 40 per cent on a net income basis," PwC executive director Suresh Swamy said.
"Due to high volume of transactions usually carried on by algo-funds, there was a possibility of that their income would be characterised as business income."
However, with government accounting in the Budget 2014-15 that the income arising from transactions conducted by FPIs would be classified as capital gains with effect from April 1, 2015, many more investors are likely to take to algo-trading.
"This means FPI's long term capital gains earned on transfer of securities on which securities transaction tax is paid will be exempt from tax," Mr Swamy said.
"While short term capital gains are taxable at 15 per cent."
As per Sebi's latest data there are nearly 8,400 registered FPIs in the country. FPIs have poured in a total of $204.64 billion so far into the economy and are one of the largest drivers of Indian stock markets. According to the government, necessary amendments to the norms for treating FPI income as capital gains would be made with effect from April 1, 2015.
Under the proposed amendments, any security held by FPI which would be treated as capital asset only so that any income arising from transfer of such security by FPI would be in the nature of capital gain. There is no tax on long-term capital gains while short term capital gains are taxable at the rate of 15 per cent.
The proposed move by the government would also encourage their fund managers to shift to India.
Algo-trading norms to prevent systemic risks caused by use of such systems have been in place since 2012. These norms require bourses to ensure that all such orders are routed through broker servers located in India and that appropriate risk-control mechanism are in place.
"Since there is no human intervention, algo-trading is usually faster and more efficient than manual trades placed by traders."

Over 1 500 MHz Spectrum Likely to be Available by 2015You are here: Home Industries
Over 1,500 MHz Spectrum Likely to be Available by 2015
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 21, 2014 21:41 (IST)
Manufacturing Growth May Moderate in December Quarter: Industry Body
New Delhi: About 1,538 MHz of spectrum in various bands for telecom services may be made available for auction next year, a move that will help the government expand mobile and broadband penetration in the country.
In the premium 700 Mhz band, which can be used for 4G and is even being considered for 5G services, 93 MHz of radiowaves can be put for sale. In the 800 MHz (CMDA), 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz bands 117.5 MHz, 184 MHz and 104 MHz, respectively, can be made available, sources said.
In 2,300 MHz band (broadband wireless access spectrum) 320 MHz spectrum and in the 2,500 MHz band, about 720 MHz could also be put on the block for sale, they added.
Besides, the government expects to make available a fresh set of 300 MHz spectrum for mobile services by 2017 and an additional 200 MHz by 2020.
Sources said that almost all of the spectrum in 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz will be available through the expiry of licences as well as that unsold in the last conducted auction.
For 700 MHz band, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had recommended that the reserve price for the spectrum should be four times of that of the 1,800 MHz band.
The 700-Mhz frequency band is considered to be one of the most valuable slots for telecom services as most of the latest technology can be transmitted in this band. Also investment required to roll out infrastructure will be lower for telecom companies in 700 Mhz compared to using higher frequency.
Spectrum auction in the last four years has fetched the government about Rs 1.75 lakh crore, which includes Rs 61,162 crore this year from auction in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz band and Rs 1.05 lakh in 2010 in 2,300 MHz and 2,500 MHz.
Government has set a revenue target of Rs 45,471 crore from communication services, including proceeds from spectrum auction and other related charges in the current fiscal year (2014-15).
Additionally, there are plans to make available 85 MHz spectrum in the 2,100 MHz band - currently used for 3G services - but that will be subject to release by the Defence Ministry, sources said.
Availability of spectrum will aid the government in achieving the objectives in the National Telecom Policy (NTP) 2012.
According to NTP 2012, the government aims to increase rural tele-density from the current level of around 39 to 70 by the year 2017 and 100 by the year 2020.
Besides, it aims to provide affordable and reliable broadband on demand by 2015, to achieve 175 million broadband connections by the year 2017 and 600 million by the year 2020, at minimum 2 Mbps download speed and making available higher speeds of at least 100 Mbps on demand.

Yahoo buys B lore tech startup bookpad for R...Bookpad
((From left) Bookpad founders…)
BANGALORE: Bangalore-based Bookpad has become the first Indian tech startup to be bought by Yahoo, going from creation to acquisition in just one year. The deal comes some eight months after Facebook snapped up Bangalore's Little Eye Labs.
The US internet giant, which is in line to reap about $9.5 billion (Rs 57,000 crore) from Alibaba's initial public offering, has bought the firm in a deal worth around Rs 50 crore ($ 8.3 million), according two people with direct knowledge of the development. Yahoo has so far bought over 100 companies. "The deal is done. The team will be moving to Silicon Valley soon," said a person directly familiar with the ongoing talks. "Large firms like Autodesk and Dropbox were also eyeing Bookpad."
Founded by IIT-Guwahati alumni Niketh Sabbineni, Aditya Bandi and Ashwik Reddy — friends in their early twenties — Bookpad is competing with large companies like Google and Crocodoc in document viewing.
The talks started in May when Sabbineni met Yahoo officials during the InnoTrek trip, organised by industry body Nasscom, to the Silicon Valley in the United States. "In fact, he (Sabbineni) even did not have a visa and he got it at last moment," said a person who is privy to the talks.
An email query sent to Yahoo remained unanswered while Bookpad founders declined to offer comment about any such deal.
In January, Bangalore-based Little Eye Labs became the first Indian firm to be bought by Facebook. Google India managing director and top angel investor Rajan Anandan referred the acquisition of firms like Bookpad and Little Eye Labs as a warm up exercise towards bigger deals.
"It is day one of the test match. The team has just stepped on the field and is warming up," said Anandan. "The game is about to start and it will be an explosively exciting game." Anandan said there are already billion dollar product companies like Zoho and InMobi. And India will create many more billion dollar product companies and hundreds will be in the $10 million (Rs60 crore) to $100 million (Rs600 crore) valuation range. Like Google Docs , Bookpad enables customers create and format text documents online and also collaborate with other people in real time. But what differentiates the firm from global competitors is that it allows enterprises to modify the product as per their needs and promote their brand. "It (Bookpad) is like a baby born to us. We have been nurturing them. They have technology, talent and traction," said Ravi Gururaj, chairman of the Nasscom Product Council, which mentored and incubated the fledgling venture through its 10,000 Startups initiative and startup warehouse facility.
"This acquisition validates that large companies are willing to do a deal, when the technology is useful for them," said Nasscom senior manager Ashok Madaravally who has closely worked with Bookpad team from beginning. Bookpad, which has a team of eight, earns revenue of around Rs1 crore per annum and is focused on the US market.
"Getting acquired by Yahoo puts Bangalore on the global startup map," said Karnataka state's secretary for information technology and biotechnology, Srivatsa Krishna. "We will do everything it takes to match Silicon Valley and become the world's favourite startup hub." Gururaj of Nasscom said Yahoo has a reputation of a voracious appetite for startups. "And now with Alibaba's cash warchest, we hope there are going to be more deals like Bookpad," said Gururaj.
Unlike a typical startup in India which has to face issues such as mentoring and funding, Bookpad's received nurturing from the beginning.
While working at technology firms Amazon and Symantec, Sabbineni and Bandi would spend five hours every alternate day at Cafe Coffee Day in Hyderabad building the prototype. Last year the founders quit their jobs to launch Bookpad with the money they had saved.
The firm shifted to Bangalore, after it got selected for the Startup Warehouse programme, a co-working space provided by Nasscom and Karnataka government . Bookpad was in the first batch of the startups in the warehouse.
Bookpad pivoted its business model by focusing on enterprises rather than consumers. It bagged customers ranging from e-Learning firms to cloud storage companies. Last October when Bookpad made a pitch at the Nasscom product conclave, the Microsoft Ventures director Ravi Narayan got impressed and selected them for the company's accelerator programme.

India  US work on WTO deal ahead of Modi visitComments
India and the US are working on a compromise formula on food subsidies to remove a major irritant in the stalled World Trade Organization (WTO) deal ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with President Barack Obama in Washington later this month.
Logo of the World Trade Organization (WTO), that deals with the global rules of trade between nations.
Top government sources told HT that India and US were working to revise the terms of the so-called trade facilitation agreement (TFA) for easier, faster and cheaper trade by making systems transparent and cutting red tape ahead of the Modi-Obama summit.
Once the two sides agree on broad contours, it should pave the way for a new agreement at the WTO.
This and many more big tickets announcements are expected when Modi visits the White House on September 29-30 after meeting other world leaders on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York.
Read: US nudge on WTO position continues
India has made it clear that state-funded welfare schemes for the poor were non-negotiable even taking the blame for blocking the TFA in July as it did not come bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies.
The TFA would have hit India’s food security programme and food grain procurement through the minimum support prices (MSP).
As part of a revised proposal, India and the US are learnt to be discussing the finer nuances of an indefinite “peace clause” on food security until a permanent solution is found, the sources said.
A “peace clause” gives legal security to member countries and protects them from being challenged under other WTO agreements.
Developed nations have shown support for a “peace clause” that would agree to developing countries’ demands on food security for a period of four years.
India, however, is pushing for a guarantee for further exemption until a permanent solution is negotiated and a way found to allow countries the right to provide higher subsidies to their poor beyond these four years.
When US secretary of state John Kerry visited India in July, the PM conveyed to Washington that the WTO deadlock should not come in the way of a much larger relationship, officials said.
 Besides, sources said, Obama was keen on a “productive summit” with Modi, with the White House also pushing hard for the thorny WTO issue to be sorted out before the two leaders meet.
In July, India withstood mounting pressure from the developed countries, including the US, which had blamed New Delhi’s “rigid stand” for the collapse of the talks, putting the WTO’s future in “uncertain ground.”
India is of the view that without a permanent solution, its food subsidies and public stockholding programmes such as buffer stocks will be hampered.
Read: 'India talking to WTO members on food subsidy issue'
Existing rules cap the value of food subsidies at 10% of the value of production. But, the subsidy is calculated against three-decade-old prices which have since risen many fold. It means that many countries will find it difficult to stay within the WTO limits, potentially attracting strong penalties.

BSE Sensex, Nifty Fall Sharply Amid Broad Decline
NDTV | Updated On: September 22, 2014 09:39 (IST)
The Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
BSE Sensex and Nifty moved lower by nearly 0.5 per cent today, tracking weak Asian markets. BSE Sensex was down 138 points to 26,951 while Nifty fell 48 points to 8,073.
All the BSE sectoral indices on the BSE were lower today with strong profit-taking seen in recent outperforming sectors such as banking, pharma, capital goods and IT stocks. Market analysts expect Indian markets to remain volatile this week ahead of the derivative expiry on Thursday.
"The Nifty is likely to see high volatility today as markets have entered the derivatives expiry week. After a sharp bout of short-covering last week, expect profit-taking today as most Asian cues are benign," said market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin.
However, some buying activity was seen in midcap and smallcap stocks. The BSE midcap index was mildly positive while the smallcap index rose nearly 0.4 per cent.
Among major Nifty losers, Sesa Sterlite, Asian Paints, Cipla, Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy's were down over 2 per cent.
In Asian markets, Hong Kong shares were down 1.4 per cent while Japan Nikkei fell 0.80 per cent. Asian shares skidded on Monday as investors awaited data this week that could provide more evidence of a slowdown in China, while the dollar gave back a little of its recent gains.
China's flash manufacturing PMI reading on Tuesday could come in below the 50 level, indicating that manufacturing activity is contracting.
"The psychological effect of a below-50 reading will be significant and consistent with the slew of softer Chinese data over recent weeks." Mitul Kotecha, head of FX strategy Asia-Pacific for Barclays in Singapore, said in a note to clients. (With Agency Inputs)

Infosys transformation may take 2 years: Ana...Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director
(With Vishal Sikka at…)
BANGALORE: Infosys' two-year transformational process may take at least another two years as the company aims to scale itself to offer high-value services, according to experts who got a chance to interact for the first time with Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Vishal Sikka at an event in Berlin last week.
Even so, analysts who were at the customer event believe that if successful, the country's secondlargest software exporter could see improved margins with a new approach of trying to balance "to-do-same-for-less" contracts with "co-innovate-withthe-customer" type of deals. "Vishal presented a plan to reposition Infosys as a co-innovator for new business logic jointly with the customers," said Stefan Ried, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research .
"Some is packaged in Edge application (products, platforms and solutions or EdgeVerve) or Finacle (core banking product), others are less packaged and customer-specific," said Ried. "Infosys is in a transformational process since the last two years, which may take another two to three years."
The company "will take probably couple of years to be where" it aims to be, Infosys Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao said at a CLSA conference on September 15.
"Today, when we look at our business, a big part of our business is getting commoditised," said Rao, adding that customers don't see much difference between offerings of leading IT outsourcers.
"So one of the areas we are looking at is how to start looking at some of the delivery service offerings, how to bring in element of differentiation, how to introduce automation and how to be more productive so that we can be more competitive," he said.
For the past few years, Infosys has been lagging behind some of its peers, including the country's leading IT firm, Tata Consultancy Services. When founder NR Narayana Murthy was asked to return to steer the company last June, he outlined a three-pronged strategy to help Infosys.
With Sikka at the helm now, the company is seeking to "transform" itself to be able to deliver innovative solutions. Sikka was a member of the Executive Board of SAP AG before joining Infosys in August.
"Somebody who is just outsourcing infrastructure could ybe replaced after the contract is expired but somebody who helps you architect your company's business logic stay for decades, just like SAP does," said Ried. To offer such solutions, Sikka is looking at ways to reduce costs and help free up budgets for innovation, according to Philip Carnelley, research director, European Software Group at IDC .

Indian women win 25m team pistol bronze in AsiadIndian women win 25m team pistol bronze in Asiad
Press Trust of India | Incheon Sep 22, 2014 09:55 AM IST
Shooters continued to deliver medals for India at the 17th Asian Games with the trio of Heena Siddhu, Rahi Sarnobat and Anisa Sayyed cliching a bronze in the women's 25m pistol event here today.
Heena (572), Anisa (577) and Rahi (580) combined for a score of 1729 to finish third behind silver-medallists China (1747) and hosts South Korea, who won the gold with a score of 1748.
The top-finishing South Korean team comprised Jangmi Kim (584), Junghye Kwak (583) and Jungeun Lee (581).
While Anisa and Rahi did well in rapid fire, Heena was better in the precision rounds.
"There was a lot of pressure as we knew that me and Rahi had to do well in rapid fire as Heena is new to this format," said Anisa.
"It is my first Asian Games medal and I am very happy because otherwise people would have said that we did not deliver despite being rapid fire experts," she added.
However, the troika of Ayonika Paul, Apurvi Chandela and Raj Chaudhary finished a disappointing sixth in the 10m Air Rifle Women's Team Finals.
World No. 8 Ayonika scored a creditable 417.7 but Apurvi Chandela (413.8) and Raj Choudhary (407.6) failed to come up with a better show and their combined total of 1239.1 left them at the sixth spot.
China rode on Siling YI, Binbin Zhang and Liuxi Wu to clinch the gold with an aggregate score of 1253.8, while the Iran team comprising Najmeh Khedmati, Narjes Andevari Emamgholinejad and Elaheh Ahmadi won the silver.
Kim Seola, Kim Gaenam and Mira Jeong earned hosts Korea a bronze with a combined score of 1241.6.
The 21-year-old Ayonika, who had clinched a silver medal in Commonwealth Games and also fetched a World Cup bronze in Slovenia, qualified for 10m rifle individual final but finished seventh after coming up with scores of 101.9.
The Indian was tied third with 30.8 after the first series but dropped to sixth place with 61.4 next. She remained tied sixth after the third series but by the end of the fourth series, Ayonika was out of the competition following shots of 9.7 and 10.5.
Iran occupied the first two places with Najmeh Khedmati and Narjes Andevari Emamgholinejad winning the gold and silver. China's Binbin Zhang won the bronze.
Meanwhile, Indian swimmers continued to struggle with Prathapan Nair failing to qualify for the men's 50m backstroke finals today.
The Indian women's rowing team was eliminated from the lightweight quadruple sculls event after finishing last in their repechage round.

Hyderabad faces threat of losing sheen as a preferred investment destination

(Are investors worrying…)
HYDERABAD: Is Hyderabad facing the threat of losing its sheen as one of India's preferred investment destinations and are investors worrying over their investments in the city after it has become capital of the country's newest state of Telangana?
Days after engineering giant L&T expressed concerns over the viability of India's largest metro rail project coming up in Hyderabad involving an investment of over Rs 16,000 crore, several businessmen ET spoke to affirmed similar concerns.
While businesses are mainly concerned over the fall in floating migrant population that would affect the revenues, they are also worried about the sharp deterioration in power supply in Telangana that is forcing production holidays and sharply increasing operating costs.
The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS)-led government, which had earlier brushed aside such concerns and termed them totally unfounded and instigated by anti-Telangana forces, admitted for the first time on record on Friday before the 14th Finance Commission that the environment was indeed unfavourable.
3,000 Businesses Shift Base
The state government, which had contested ET's report in June on 700 companies shifting their base out of Telangana, told the commission that at least 3,000 businesses had shifted their base to residual Andhra Pradesh in the past three months, fearing that "the momentum will pick up in the years to come".
For the first time, the government also said, "There will be erosion in tax base not only in respect of VAT but also stamps and registration, motor vehicles tax and state excise". Further, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said that "there will be erosion of tax base in the short-tomedium term" and that "despite the suitability of the state for location of industry , power shortage in the state is a major hurdle".
Flagging these serious concerns, Rao added, "The present tax base of the state will witness massive erosion once Hyderabad ceases to be the common capital of the successor states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The number of people visiting Hyderabad will come down drastically and there is likely to be a consequent fall in sales of petroleum products and commodities."
Corroborating the distress, the chief executive of a public sector bank said on condition of anonymity, "Of late, we have been receiving increasing number of loan restructuring requests from our borrowers, mostly from hospitality, realty, construction, entertainment and shopping malls in and around Hyderabad, citing fall in footfalls and occupancy ratios."
Force Majeure Clause
A top bureaucrat, who did not want to be named, said, "Telangana has a large number of PPP (public-private partnership) projects in roads, urban infrastructure and public transport. If the number of people visiting Hyderabad comes down drastically as being feared by the state government, then we could soon see private partners in PPP pro jects invoking force majeure clause seeking compensation through incentives and extension of concession periods."
He added that there were already some indications from the private partners in this regard.
  B Vinod Kumar, TRS' politburo member and the party's deputy floor leader in Lok Sabha said the chief minister was only trying to give a fair picture of Hyderabad in terms of tax revenues post bifurcation even as he added that there was nothing to seriously worry about.
"If L&T pulls out of Hydera bad metro rail project, there are several players ready to take up the project. We are confident of proving our detractors wrong on capital flight from Telangana and will attract large-scale in vestments like what Mumbai did after separation of Gujarat from Maharashtra," he said.
Last week, L&T wrote to Telangana government that following bifurcation of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh "the position of Hyderabad in drawing invest ments, both from the central government and private sector has altered...the change in the status of Hyderabad has resulted in significant change in the economic and political outlook of Hyderabad, thereby causing material adverse impact on the financial viability of the (Hyderabad metro rail) project". The state government moved to placate L&T after the company threatened to pull out of the Hyderabad metro rail project, the country's largest public-private-partnership project.
Apprehension Over Image
The alarm bells sounded by L&T raised apprehensions over the image of Hyderabad and Telangana as a businessfriendly destination.
E Sudhir Reddy, chairman of infrastructure group IVRCL, said, "The Telangana government should immediately dwell into the reasons behind Hyderabad-based businesses looking at shifting their base to residual AP. If it is because of special tax benefits that the Andhra Pradesh government is proposing to offer, then the Telangana government should also ensure similar benefits. It helps not only to entice new businesses but also retain the existing businesses."
Opposition parties blame the "irresponsible hate statements" of the CM targeting the settlers responsible for businesses moving out of the state.

Obama tries Reagan touch on economy  wages w...Barack Obama tries Ronald Reagan touch on economy, but wages weigh
By Reuters | 22 Sep, 2014, 10.43AM IST
Between 2009 when Obama took office and 2013, the latest for which numbers are available, median annual household incomes fell by more than $2,100.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama , stumping for the Democrats ahead of November's congressional elections, has twice invoked Ronald Reagan's seminal campaign question: "are you better off than you were four years ago?"
Framing the debate like that helped Reagan twice - in 1980 when he beat incumbent Jimmy Carter , and then again in 1984 when he won re-election during an economic upswing.
But a similar message has failed to resonate for Obama primarily for one reason: while he stresses the economy has improved in almost every aspect on his watch, average family incomes have slipped.
Between 2009 when Obama took office and 2013, the latest for which numbers are available, median annual household incomes fell by more than $2,100 in inflation-adjusted terms, Census Bureau data showed last week.
"It's hard to make the case for 'Morning again in America' the way that Ronald Reagan was able to do in 1984," said John Ullyot, a former Senate Republican aide, now with a strategy firm High Lantern Group .
"People just don't feel connected to the recovery."
White House economists have pointed out that the census figures do not reflect job growth and the rise in average hourly earnings seen this year, but any improvements have yet to register with the public.
Opinion polls make disturbing reading for the Democratic Party , which will have a tough time defending its slim Senate majority in the Nov. 4 election.
Roughly two-thirds of the population thinks the economy is heading in the wrong direction, survey data from polling firm Ipsos has consistently shown over the last two years.
About four in 10 Americans also strongly disapprove of Obama's handling of the economy and less than one in 10 feel he is doing a really good job. The president's own overall approval rating is stuck at around 40 per cent.
Frustrated by the public's failure to give this administration credit for leading the world's biggest economy out of its worst recession since the 1930s, Obama and his team have gone to lengths to change that.
While crisscrossing the country in the past months to drum up support for the Democrats, Obama on at least nine occasions stressed how almost all economic gauges have improved during his presidency.
RECOVERY AND WAGE CHALLENGE
For one, the recovery from the 2007-2009 recession is the slowest since World War Two, but it has already extended beyond the post-war average of 58 months and there seems to be more gas in the tank. The International Monetary Fund expects the US economy to grow 3 per cent next year and in 2016.
On Obama's watch, 5.1 million jobs have also been added to payrolls, the S&P/Case-Shiller national home price index is up about 17 per cent and the S&P 500 stock index has more than doubled while hitting all-time records.
"By almost every economic measure, we are better off today than we were when I took office," Obama told a Democratic women's forum in Washington on Friday, repeating the familiar refrain.
He frequently chastises the media for underplaying news that US factories, oil fields and the stock market are booming and businesses are hiring.
"You wouldn't always know it from watching the news," he told a Labor Day picnic in Milwaukee on Sept 1.
Two days later, the White House arranged a special briefing for reporters with the president's top economic advisers, who walked through 17 charts showing the economy on the rise.
Yet near the end, when asked what indicators had failed to bounce back, Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers acknowledged that stagnant incomes remained a worry.
"Wages remain one of the most fundamental economic challenges we have," Furman said.
Many economists point out that stagnant wages are a problem that long predates this presidency. In fact, many believe that by the time incomes peaked in 1999 the United States was already slipping into a less dynamic era, grappling like other developed economies with aging and other structural impediments.
"There are big structural forces at work here. That's not necessarily a policy error in the last few years," said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Even as Obama touts his economic accomplishments, he acknowledges more needs to be done to boost worker earnings.
"That's not the simplest of messages," said Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden between 2009 and 2011. "It's saying, 'We're moving in the right direction, but we're not there yet.'"
The problem is that not all economic indicators were created equal and not much else matters for the public if the money remains tight.
"I can't imagine people feel particularly elated when they're told GDP was up 4 per cent last quarter, but median income was flat last year," Bernstein said.

(KTG is in the process of adding…)
MUMBAI: Kochi-based Kitex Garments (KTG) has rallied 20 per cent in trade after Motilal Oswal initiated coverage with a 'Buy' recommendation.
According to the brokerage, the company has diversified its clients mix from a single client in FY09 to five currently, reducing client concentration risk and improving margins.
KTG is in the process of adding some large clients in FY15 apart from deepening business with existing clients like Gerber, Toys R Us , Jockey, Mothercare and Carter's.
The company is in the business of manufacturing and exporting infant garments. It derives 85 per cent of its revenue from the sale of infant garments and the balance 15 per cent from the sale of fabric to Kitex Childrenwear.
"Going forward, KTG intends to improve its revenue mix in favor of high margin clients like Toys R Us, Jockey and Mothercare, who procure high value-added products which will drive continued margin improvement," the report said.
"We expect KTG to post 24.6 per cent revenue CAGR coupled with 700bp margin expansion over FY14-FY17E. Hence, we expect PAT to post 40 per cent CAGR over FY14-17E. With 60 per cent capacity utilization currently, we expect ramp-up of existing capacities and minimal expansion capex," the report said.
"Given strong balance sheet and significant free cash flows, RoCE and RoE should improve from ~37 per cent and 39 per cent respectively to ~58 per cent and 39 per cent over FY14-17E. At CMP, the stock trades at 24.5x FY15E, 16.6x FY16E and 12.4x FY17E EPS," the report added.
Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage with a 'Buy' rating with a target price of Rs 615, an upside of 50 per cent, from its last closing price of Rs 410.
At 10:35 a.m.; the stock was at Rs 459.30, up 12.44 per cent, on the BSE. It touched a high of Rs 462.80 and a low of Rs 426.65 in trade today.

India can see $100bn worth e-comm co in 10-20 yrs: SnapdealRead more at: http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/alibabatalkssnapdeal-to-enter-india-report_1182219.html?utm_source=ref_article
“The response to Alibaba IPO gives confidence to company like ours, but the conventional way of valuations may not work for e-commerce sites as their growth is more than 50 percent at a time when other companies report below 15-20 percent growth,” adds Bansal.
Adding to Bansal’s optimism is Henry Guo, senior research analyst, JG Capital who says such companies have huge potential as India continues to see mobile penetration in widespread areas.
Also Read: Why e-commerce is taking India by a storm
This potential, Bansal expects, is to the tune of a USD 60-70 billion Indian e-commerce market.
“There is no reason to believe that in 10-20 years e-commerce in India will be anything less than 10 percent of retail. By that time retail in itself will be a trillion dollar market. So there is absolutely a 100 percent possibility of creating a USD 100 billion e-commerce company out of India,” he further adds.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Rohit Bansal and Henry Guo's interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: Alibaba listed and now we know nearly 40 percent premium to its issue price commanding a marketcap of what USD 220 billion. Is this once again a case of investor over exuberance which will get watered down like in Facebook?
Bansal: Alibaba’s IPO is a great event in many ways for us because the way we think about it is- it validates two big things. One big thing that it validates is, Aliababa is a company from an emerging market (EM) like China and it is one of the top five technology companies, one of the largest tech companies of the world now. So, this gives us a lot of confidence that large technology companies can come out of the EMs. We are seeing that trend coming out of China right now and we will soon start seeing that trend coming out of India as well. So that is one thing that is very good about this IPO.
Secondly, we been big believers in the marketplace business model of e-commerce and this to a large extent validates out belief which we and our entire team has held for a long time that you don’t need to own inventory as an e-commerce company to sell and a pure marketplace which is essentially a technology platform connecting buyers and sellers. You can build a very large and profitable and successful enterprise out of that. So, we are extremely excited about this event which has happened and congratulations to the Alibaba team.
Sonia: How do you value these e-commerce companies as we do not have any precedent in India to value them?
Bansal: One of the most important things which are unique to technology companies, specifically e-commerce companies in growing markets is that these companies see an extremely different growth rate as compared to more mature industries.
In most mature industries 10-15-20 percent per annum will be a huge growth rate whereas in technology and e-commerce it is common to see growth rates upward to 50 percent-100 percent etc and as a result the traditional way of thinking about valuations may or may not be the right way to think about these things because the forward looking scope of growth of these companies is huge for example in a market like India, e-commerce today is just 0.3-0.4 percent of overall retail in India whereas if you look at any developed market e-commerce is anywhere from 6-13 percent.
Our expectation is that the same is going to happen in India because the fundamentals of e-commerce are very strong and even if retail doesn\\'t grow for the next five years, we are very confident that the e-commerce in India is going to be USD 60-70 billion market and as a result the front running players in e-commerce are the once that are best positioned to capture that market.
Latha: How long does it take for an e-commerce company to breakeven and report profits. We haven’t seen that in many companies in India?
Bansal: E-comm is no different from any other sector because the growth rates are very high but at the same time similar to what happened in telecom or in retail, it takes building a lot of infrastructure to be able to support that growth.
In the very early days a lot of investment goes into building technology for e-commerce, building supply chain technology, building the core infrastructure which can support e-commerce which consumes a lot of capital but as the business size keeps growing, for us as a company, we are profitable at a transaction level but there are expenditures that we do which are investments that we make to grow infrastructure and build technology and then the business size starts growing.
The profits that we generate out of the business start surpassing the investments that we need to make and as a result the company becomes profitable. So it’s that simple and it is important to see that from that timeframe in mind knowing that it’s important to invest in infrastructure and technology today which e-commerce at scale can't be supported.
Sonia: Snapdeal believes that from the current USD 3 billion that the online retail market is worth in India, it could grow to USD 60-70 billion per year. Is that the kind of estimates that you have as well for the emerging market online retail space?
Gua: We see huge potential in China especially when the mobile internet penetration continues in China and people may have computer, the PC but they use the mobile device to make online transaction from mobile device that drives the e-commerce, the penetration in China.
Latha: How long does it take for an e-commerce company to break into the black as well will that period go on increasing because as there are more players they have to spend more on advertising, isn’t it, to simply be heard across the clutter?
Guo: Yes, several players in China spend huge amount of money on the infrastructure including the fulfillment and logistics delivery. So, it takes a lot of money to build the foundation, but for Alibaba its little bit different; Alibaba is depending on third party infrastructure to put that through consumers to save a lot of money.

See 25% growth in exports this fiscal: Mayur Uniquoters08:00 am
Artificial leather maker  Mayur Uniquoters expects to see a 15-20 percent growth this fiscal year. The company is adding two new units to production in the second half of FY15, says CMD and CEO Suresh Kumar Poddar.
He sees 25 percent growth in the exports segment this fiscal, while adding that margins are better in exports than domestic segment. The company saw sustained operational performance aided by rising share of exports.
As of now, 50 percent of the company’s total turnover comes from the footwear industry, followed by automotive at 35 percent and lastly leather goods, furnishing, bags, etc., contribute 15 percent.
Poddar sees FY15 capex at around Rs 70 crore.
Mayur Uniquoters' sixth production line will be operational by December 2014.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Suresh Kumar Poddar's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Sonia: Can you tell us about what kind of a growth potential you see because you supply to a lot of the OEM guys and now there is a pick up that we are seeing in the auto sector? So you did about 24 percent revenue growth last year and a 30 percent profit growth, what kind of growth do you forecast for this year and next?
A: This year, we expect a growth between 15 percent and 20 percent. In next three years also we expect that we should have at least 18-20 percent growth.
Latha: You are coming with some expansions, are you producing to capacity now and how will your capacity look next year?
A: Yes. At the beginning of this year, our capacity was about 1.85 million meters every month. Now we are adding two lines this year which will enhance our capacity by 1.2 million and within next three years from now, we will be adding our capacity to 50 million meters every year. That means we are talking about 2.5 time capacity add in three years time starting from this year.
Latha: Why are giving a modest 15-20 percent sales growth? It could be much bigger when the production comes on line, right?
A: Yes, the production is not an issue but we are not selling directly to the consumer. We are selling to the converter like footwear manufacturers, automotive manufacturers, everybody is buying from somewhere. To add our sales, it will take some time. This is a conservative figure, it maybe more. In the previous year also I have said 20 percent but we have done 30 percent. So we are doing a lot in exports, like our export has gone up Rs 106 crore last year and this year I expect at least 25 percent growth in exports. Exports we are doing automotive OEM exports like Ford and Chrysler in USA. Now we are making general export after market for furnishing, automotive like that. That last year we have increased our sales by 90 percent and this year I am targeting minimum 50 percent. So my full energy will be on export that is what we are planning.
Latha: Are the margins better in exports, what are the margins for the two domestic and exports?
A: Margin is little better than local.
Sonia: Can you tell us how much of your business comes from catering to the footwear market and how much from the auto market, what is the break up look like?
A: Footwear is approximately 50 percent and 35 percent from automotive. From 35 percent, there are three divisions, one is domestic automotive another is export automotive and then there is a huge replacement market. So if you add all these three, it is about 35 percent of our turnover. Rest of the 15 percent is from furnishing industry, is from leather goods industry, bag industries like that because this is used everywhere, most of the articles.
Latha: Will you be issuing new shares and I am telling you where my worry is coming from? I am looking at your last five year financial performance. In 2012 your earning per share was actually Rs 61.50 then it has fallen to Rs 40 and then to Rs 26. At the same time your profit did not fall, it went from Rs 33 crore to Rs 43 crore to Rs 56 crore. In spite of it, your EPSs have been falling. I would assume it is because you have issued new shares. So will any of the current capex of 2.5 times capex be funded through new share issues?
A: No, no more new share issues.
Latha: When was the last share issuance?
A: Just four months back. It was given to Westbridge.
Latha: How much did you raise and at what price?
A: We have raised about Rs 70 crore.
Latha: At what price approximately?
A: Before bonus - we have given the bonus recently so it was Rs 235 before bonus.
Sonia: What is the current capex that you will be using for the next six-twelve months, what are the capex plans?
A: Capex plan this year because since my another sixth line will be added this year so this year my capex will be about not less than Rs 70 crore, which we will be doing from our own generations.
Sonia: When will the sixth line start?
A: By December.
Sonia: Any target that you have as far as margins? You did say that the margins will go up because of rising exports but will it be above 20 percent, above 22 percent, any target by the end of next year?
A: Last year, the year was good because the prices of raw material have fallen. That is why we could have good margin. But this year let us see, we will try to maintain what we have done last year.
Latha: Normalised margins are not 20, is it?
A: Normally it is not 20. If you go back previous year, the margin was not that - it is because of price has fallen and that has not been passed to the customer. Now we have to pass it on.

NASAs MAVEN spacecraft enters Mars orbitNASA’s MAVEN spacecraft enters Mars orbit
PTI
Tweet
Washington, Sept 22:  
NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft began orbiting Mars on a mission to study how the Red Planet’s climate changed over time from warm and wet to cold and dry.
“Based on observed navigation data, congratulations. MAVEN is now in orbit,” said Dave Folta of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.
The unmanned orbiter has travelled more than 10 months and 711 million kilometres to reach Mars yesterday for a first-of-its kind study of the planet’s upper atmosphere.
The data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft aims to help scientists understand what happened to the water on Mars and the carbon dioxide in its atmosphere several billion years ago.
How Mars lost its atmosphere is one of science’s biggest mysteries. The answers could shed light on the planet’s potential to support life — even if that was just microbial life — long ago.
MAVEN’s findings are also expected to help add to knowledge of how humans could survive on a future visit to the Red Planet, perhaps as early as 2030.
“Mars is a cool place, but there is not much atmosphere,” said John Clarke, of the MAVEN science team.
“It is very cold, it is well below zero. The atmosphere is about half a per cent of what we are breathing,” he added.
“But we know that Mars could change and it was probably different in the past. There is a lot of evidence of flowing water on the surface from Mars’s ancient history.”
Next, MAVEN will enter a six-week phase for tests.
Then, it begins a one-year mission of studying the gases in Mars’s upper atmosphere and how it interacts with the sun and solar wind.
Much of MAVEN’s year-long mission will be spent circling the planet 3,730 miles above the surface. However, it will execute five deep dips to a distance of just 78 miles above the Martian landscape to get readings of the atmosphere at various levels.
NASA has sent several rovers and probes to Mars in recent years.
The US space agency’s latest robotic vehicle, Curiosity, is exploring Gale Crater and Mount Sharp, looking for interesting rocks and returning data on whether the Martian environment shows evidence of a past ability to support life.
Later this week, an Indian spacecraft, the Mars Orbiter Mission, will be on course to reach Mars.
The unmanned MOM probe is set to enter Mars’s orbit in the next few years after 10 months in space, marking India’s first mission to the planet to search for evidence of life.

2 killed  many injured in explosions in Chinas Xinjiang province2 killed, many injured in explosions in China’s Xinjiang province
PTI

Beijing, Sept 22:  
At least two persons were killed and several others injured in a series of explosions in China’s restive Muslim-dominated Xinjiang province.
Explosions hit at least three locations in Xinjiang’s Luntai County last evening, the Tianshan news portal, run by the regional government, said in a short report this morning.
The report did not identify the explosions, which appeared to be coordinated attacks, as acts of terrorism, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.
“The local social order was normal,” the Tianshan said, indicating that there was no further unrest following the explosions.
An unspecified number of those wounded have been admitted to hospitals, the report said.
Investigations were ongoing, the Post said.
Photos in Weibo, akin Twitter in China, showed smoke billowing out in two locations with widespread damage to the vehicles.
More than half of the county’s 113,000 residents are ethnic Uygurs, according to local census information.
A series of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang shocked China this year, with the latest in early August when 37 civilians were killed and another 13 injured in Shache County of Kashgar Prefecture.
China blames the attacks on East Turkestan Islamic Movement, an al-Qaeda backed organisation active in Xinjiang province where the native Muslim Uygurs were restive over the increasing settlements of Hans from other provinces.
China is currently conducting a massive year-long campaign to quell the spread of the ETIM influence in the province.

Syria refugee flood to Turkey hits100 000A Turkish soldier stands guard as several hundred Syrian refugees wait to cross the border in Suruc, Turkey, Sunday. (Source: AP)
Kucuk Kendirciler (turkey) | Posted: September 22, 2014 11:34 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 11:39 am
The 19-year-old Kurdish militant , who has been fighting the Islamic State group in Syria, has brought his family across the border into Turkey to safety. But in the tranquility of a Turkish tea garden just miles from the frontier, Dalil Boras vowed to head back after nightfall to continue the fight.
Pulling a wad of Syrian bills from his pocket, the young fighter who has already lost a 17-year-old brother to the Islamic militants’ brutal advance on Sunday said that if the Turkish border guards tried to stop him, money would persuade them.
Boras and his relatives are among some 100,000 Syrians, mostly Kurds, who have flooded into Turkey since Thursday, escaping an Islamic State offensive that has pushed the conflict nearly within eyeshot of the Turkish border.
The al-Qaida breakaway group, which has established an Islamic state, or caliphate, ruled by its harsh version of Islamic law in territory it captured straddling the Syria-Iraq border, has in recent days advanced into Kurdish regions of Syria that border Turkey, where fleeing refugees yesterday reported atrocities that included stonings, beheadings and the torching of homes.
On Sunday, heavy clashes broke out between the Islamic State militants and Kurdish fighters only miles from the Syrian border town of Kobani, where the Islamic State group was bombarding villagers with tanks, artillery and multiple rocket launchers, said Nasser Haj Mansour, a defense official in Syria’s Kurdish region.
“They are even targeting civilians who are fleeing,” Haj Mansour said.
At a border crossing where Turkish authorities were processing the refugees, Osman Abbas said he and 20 relatives were fleeing a village near Kobani when Islamic State fighters shot one of his sons. The 35-year-old had tried to return to their home to recover valuables while the rest of the family fled.
“They took our village, they took our house, they killed my son,” Abbas said. “I saw it with my own eyes.”
As refugees flooded in, Turkey closed the border crossing at Kucuk Kendirciler to Turkish Kurds in a move aimed at preventing them from joining the fight in Syria. A day earlier, hundreds of Kurdish fighters had poured into Syria through the small Turkish village, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Clashes broke out as Kurds trying to approach the crossing from inside Turkey scuffled with security forces, who responded with tear gas, paint pellets and water cannons. The state-run Anadolu Agency said the Kurdish protesters had hurled stones at the security forces.

In controversial comments, Abhishek Banerjee, Trinamool Congress MP and nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, on Monday questioned whether the student protests in Jadavpur University were due to banning of drugs and liquor inside the campus .
“Is this protest due to the banning of drugs, liquor and charas?” he said in a Facebook post.
The comment comes in the backdrop of JU students protesting on the streets of Kolkata demanding the resignation of the VC, the Pro VC and the registrar of the varisty in the wake of alleged police assault of students in the early hours of September 17.
Thousands of students had marched through the city’s streets on Saturday demanding resignation of JU Vice-chancellor Abhijit Chakrabarti and West Bengal Governor K N Tripathi intervened to end the four-day old stalemate in the prestigious educational institution.
Students from Presidency University, Calcutta University and other educational institutions joined the march in a show of solidarity.
JU students have boycotted classes to press the demand  for the VC’s resignation. Those in the mass communication department boycotted their examination on September 18.

UN chief Ban Ki-moon and Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio joined thousands of people for a march through the city to shine the spotlight on the climate crisis with the UN Chief stressing that there is no ‘Plan B’ to halt advance of climate change as there is no ‘Planet B.’
About 400,000 people participated in one of the largest global calls for climate action at the People’s Climate March here yesterday that also saw participation by NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, former US Vice President Al Gore, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, US Senator Chuck Schumer and musician Sting.

Speaking to journalists after walking in the rally, Ban said the world needs to “galvanize our action” and harness the people’s “power to change.”
He said the international community should adopt measures to halt the advance of global climate change as there is no “Plan B” for action as there is no “Planet B.”
The rally, which came just two days before Climate Summit at the UN Headquarters, saw politicians, celebrities, activists and the general public march though the city to highlight global concerns about a lack of international action to stop the deleterious effects of climate change.
The summit is expected to draw more than 120 heads of State and Government to galvanize action on climate change.
The People’s Climate March is part of a worldwide campaign to persuade global leaders to act decisively on the issue.
Similar climate events were reported in 2,000 locations around the world.
The march is campaigning, among other issues for curbs on harmful carbon emissions which contribute to global warming.
At last count, 2,129,060 people around the world had also signed a petition calling for world leaders to take bold action at the UN Climate Summit on September 23. The petition was handed over to the UN chief on the march route.
Chanting slogans and playing music, marchers created a noisy carnival atmosphere as they filed through Manhattan.

How investing in equities can help you secure your retirement

(Adequate savings, investment…)
A cousin of mine will retire in the next three years. He lives in his own house and his children are married and well-settled. He will receive about Rs. 30 lakh as settlement amount. His simple question was: Is this money enough?
In retirement planning, this is the critical problem to solve. Retirement planners call this problem the adequacy of corpus. To my cousin, Rs. 30 lakh seemed like a lot of money, until I pointed out that, going by his current earnings, it was just five years' pay. My cousin is addressing the retirement problem too late. Even if he finds that he has not saved enough, there isn't much he can do at this stage.
He quickly pointed out that he would spend much lesser. Retirement is associated with frugal living and careful spending since investors reconcile to managing within the wealth they have accumulated. He told me that he will learn to 'manage' but needs ways to invest it 'safely'. Outliving the wealth is a fear most retired investors face, which is also the reason why they like to protect what they have.
Adequacy of corpus can make all the difference to post-retirement welfare and choices. Retirees are vulnerable. Retired investors fall prey to financial scams when they discover that their corpus is unable to fight the growing expenses. They make risky choices with their money, much like the daily wage earners who buy lottery tickets out of sheer desperation to get rich.
How do we ensure that we have enough before we retire? There are several calculators that can help with the math. Is there a common sense approach to solving this problem? Since inflation is the villain in this piece, let us build our case around it. First, consider the income during the earning years. If it is has grown at a rate that beats inflation rates, it is a positive factor. Technically, there is an opportunity to build wealth only when incomes match or exceed inflation.
Second, consider the amount of income set aside as savings. Inflation hurts the money needed for expenses every year. Savings should persist and increase even after inflation. This needs both adequate income and controlled expenses.
Third, savings have to be invested at a rate that exceeds inflation. Since only a portion of the income is saved, it needs to work hard to become a large number that will provide for future expenses.
To secure retirement, all these three factors should move favourably over all the earning years: income should grow at a rate higher than inflation so that expenses can be met; savings should be positive and groweven if inflation increases the expenses; and investment return should exceed inflation rates so that savings grow in value over time.
Consider a case where out of every Rs. 100 earned, Rs. 20 is saved. Assume that the inflation rate, the income growth rate and the investment return are all identical. This investor will not have an adequate retirement corpus. Why? It takes four years of savings to make up for one year's expense. And savings are not growing enough to beat inflation. Unless the years in retirement are fewer compared to the earning years, this money will not be adequate.
 
Adequacy of corpus needs savings that cover the income in shorter number of years, and investments that grow at higher rates over a long period of time. What are the steps to take? First, ensure that the growth rate of income always exceeds the rate of inflation. Families with more earning members, professionals that up-skill themselves to earn more, and those who work towards enhancing their earnings are in a better place when it comes to retirement. Second, make it a habit to save since your life actually depends on it.
As incomes move up, saving rates should also move up. Essentials needed for the household form lower and lower proportion of income, as income increases.
Higher savings rates ensure a higher corpus. Third, take charge of the assets that have been built with your savings to make sure that they grow at a higher rate.
Many investors are careful with their income and their savings, including my cousin. However, the risk he runs is in the manner in which his wealth is being held. The Rs. 30 lakh he will get only represents the money he accumulated in his provident fund after allowing for withdrawals to buy a house and to conduct his daughter's wedding. He has a three-bedroom house in which he lives, worth about Rs. 1 crore in today's value. His investments in bank deposits, PPF, mutual funds and savings certificates amount to Rs. 20 lakh. Has he secured his retirement? Maybe not.
He may have assets, but they are not available for his retirement. As long as he lives in that house, he will not earn any rental income. He plans to leave the house behind for his son. It looks like my cousin has spent his earning years accumulating assets for his son, even if he fails to see it as such. It is tough getting him to see the house as the white elephant.

Mid-and small-caps on mutual funds  shopping listSmall & mid-caps on mutual funds' buy list
Deepak Korgaonkar & Puneet Wadhwa | Mumbai/New Delhi Sep 22, 2014 10:49 PM IST
At a time when flows from foreign institutional (FII) investors have taken the markets to new highs, domestic mutual fund managers have focused on mid- and small-cap stocks.
According to the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE bulk deal data, fund houses such as HDFC Mutual Fund, Reliance Mutual Fund, IDFC Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund and DSP BlackRock have bought shares of mid- and small-sized companies (market capitalisation of Rs 450-1,000 crore) since July this year. During this period, mutual funds, fence-sitters for most of the past year, have invested a total of Rs 12,806 crore in the markets, compared with a net FII investment of Rs 25,549 crore.
“We have expanded our investment universe by going down the market-cap club to take advantage of the opportunities in that space. Given the greater confidence in the macro-economy and the corporate environment, mid-cap companies will be the bigger beneficiaries of the uptick in the economy,” says Navneet Munot, executive director and chief investment officer, SBI Mutual Fund. “There is a large valuation gap between large-caps and mid- and small-caps. To a large extent, this has been bridged. But still, I think the trajectory of earnings growth could be higher in the case of some mid-caps,” he adds.
Kenneth Andrade, head of investments at IDFC Mutual Fund, however, says the company isn’t adopting a new strategy, as for long, it has focused on mid-caps and emerging companies.
Among individual stocks, 8K Miles Software Services, R S Software, BL Kashyap and Sons, M M Forgings, Siyaram Silk Mills, Gammon India and Marico Kaya Enterprises have rallied about 50 per cent each, after institutional investors and mutual funds lapped up shares of these companies from the open market.
While HDFC Mutual Fund bought shares of BL Kashyap and Sons, Gammon India and Centrum Electronics, Reliance Mutual Fund has bought shares of Siyaram Silk Mills, Atul Auto, Snowman Logistics and Sanghi Industries since.
Snowman Logistics saw its market value rise 26 per cent within a week, after Reliance Mutual Fund bought two million shares of the company at Rs 79.04 a share, on the day the company was listed.
On Friday, investment management firm Vanguard Group bought equity shares of Aurobindo Pharma, Jindal Saw, PVR and HCL Infosystems, through Van Eck Associates Corporation A/C Market Vectors-Vietnam from the open market. Data show Mellon bought into Sunteck Realty, Redington India and Indiabulls Housing Finance on NSE, through bulk deals.
Within 10 days, the stock price of BL Kashyap and Sons more than doubled to Rs 19.6, after HDFC Mutual Fund bought about a million shares of the company from the open market. 8K Miles Software Services, an internet software and services provider, has rallied 38 per cent to Rs 451 in the past three trading sessions, after Sundaram BNP Paribas Mutual Fund bought two per cent stake in the company, through the open market.
Compared to August 8 (when the stock stood at Rs 199, the scrip has appreciated about 100 per cent, following DSP Blackrock buying 303,529 shares (three per cent of the company’s total equity) at Rs 175 a share.

The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex, after slipping below the 27,000-mark in early trade on Monday, recovered smartly to end with a gain of over 116 points on good buying in bluechips including ITC, Tata Motors and ONGC even as global cues remained weak.
After a lower start at 27,008.12, the 30-share BSE index dipped below 27,000 to touch a low of 26,918.93, down over 170 points. Buying after mid-session, however, lifted the Sensex to settle at 27,206.74, logging a gain of 116.32 points, or 0.43 per cent.
On Friday, the index had fallen 21.79 points, snapping two consecutive days of gain.
Besides ITC, Tata Motors and ONGC that gained in 3-4 per cent range, major Sensex gainers included Hindustan Unilever, SBI, Axis Bank, Hero MotoCorp, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto, GAIL, HDFC and TCS.
The broader 50-share National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty, after slipping below the 8,100-level to touch a low of 8,064.80, bounced back to close 24.85 points (or 0.31 per cent) higher at 8,146.30.
Both Sensex and Nifty, which were struggling to maintain 27,000 and 8,100 respectively in early trade, managed to close above these levels.
"A fresh spell of buying in recent under-performers was a notable feature of today's session," said Deepak Pahwa, a Delhi-based broker.
Short covering ahead of monthly expiry on Thursday was also seen in select blue-chip stocks, traders said.
The Small-cap index was up 0.51 per cent and Mid-cap rose by 0.20 per cent, indicating continued retail investor interest.
Buying activity also picked up momentum in non-Sensex stocks. Gitanjali Gems, PC Jewellers, Petronet LNG, Jaiprakash Associates and PPAP Automotive, among others, logged gains.
A weak closing in Asian stocks and a lower opening in Europe on reports that China dampened speculation on a potential, however, capped the gains on domestic bourses.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 6.53 crore last Friday as per provisional data.
Sectorally, the BSE Consumer Durables sector index gained the most by surging 3.12 per cent, followed by FMCG index (1.90 per cent), Auto index (1.10 per cent), Oil & Gas index (0.88 per cent), and Banking index (0.29 per cent).

New Zealand PM pushes flag change after electionwinSporting teams such as the All Blacks already use a similar banner and Key argues it is instantly recognisable as a symbol of New Zealand in the same way the maple leaf is a distinctly Canadian icon. (Source: Reuters)
Agence-France Presse | Wellington | Posted: September 22, 2014 11:53 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 11:54 am
On Monday New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said he would press ahead with plans to hold a referendum to change the national flag following his election triumph.
The centre-right leader said he wanted the ballot next year on whether to ditch the current flag, which features the Union Jack of former colonial power Britain in one corner.
“I’d like to get on with it, to me I’d like to do it as a 2015 issue,” Key told commercial station Radio Live.
“I’m obviously a big supporter of the change, I think there are a lot of strong arguments in favour of the change.”
Key has previously said he would prefer a new flag featuring the national plant, a silver fern, on a black background.
Sporting teams such as the All Blacks already use a similar banner and Key argues it is instantly recognisable as a symbol of New Zealand in the same way the maple leaf is a distinctly Canadian icon.
The existing flag was first used in 1869 and formally adopted in 1902. Its supporters say that New Zealanders have fought and died under it for generations and a change would dishonour their memory.
But critics argue it is too easily confused with those of other former British colonies such as Australia, which has an almost identical design.
Key, who increased his share of the vote to convincingly win a third term on Saturday, favours maintaining ties with Britain’s monarchy, despite his support for a new flag.

Sierra Leone concludes nationwide EbolalockdownEmpty streets are seen during a three-day lockdown to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus, in Freetown, Sierra Leone, Sunday, Sept. 21, 2014. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Sierra Leone | Posted: September 22, 2014 11:52 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 11:59 am
Frustrated residents complained of food shortages in some neighborhoods of Sierra Leone’s capital on Sunday as the country reached the third and final day of a sweeping, unprecedented lockdown designed to combat the deadly Ebola disease, volunteers said.
While most residents welcomed teams of health care workers and volunteers bearing information about the disease, rumors persisted in pockets of the city that poisoned soap was being distributed, suggesting that public education campaigns had not been entirely successful.
The streets of the capital, Freetown, were again mostly deserted on Sunday in compliance with a government order for the country’s 6 million residents to stay in their homes.

Spread by contact with bodily fluids, Ebola has killed more than 560 people in Sierra Leone and more than 2,600 across West Africa in the biggest outbreak ever recorded, according to the World Health Organization . The disease, which has also touched Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal, is believed to have sickened more than 5,500 people.
Sierra Leone’s government was hoping the lockdown — the most aggressive containment effort yet attempted — would turn the tide against the disease. There were rumors in Freetown on Sunday that officials would opt to extend the lockdown, but a Health Ministry statement issued Sunday night confirmed it had ended.
The statement said that 75 percent of the targeted 1.5 million households had been contacted by outreach teams, and that outreach would continue in “hot spots” around the country.
Health care workers had taken advantage of the lockdown to bury 71 dead bodies by Sunday morning, Health Ministry official Dr. Sarian Kamara said on a radio program. The bodies of dead Ebola victims are highly contagious, making safe burials essential to stopping the spread of the disease.
Sundays are usually quiet for residents in Sierra Leone, who go to church or stay at home with many businesses and restaurants closed.
In the city center, despite police efforts to encourage people to stay inside their homes, most families sat on their verandas chatting as radios blared through the streets. People were urged to stay tuned to their radios and televisions for public information on the lockdown.
The National Power Authority also provided uninterrupted electricity during the lockdown, so people didn’t have to rely on generators.

Amritanshu Khaitan, ED,  Eveready says the company is not looking at any further price hikes in the near-term. The company had take a price hike in July for premium AAA batteries.
Khaitan says the free cash flow (FCF) for the company is expected to jump to Rs 100 crore from the current Rs 50 crore on back of price hikes. The company hopes to pare debts from these FCF funds, adds Khaitan. The consolidated debt currently stands below Rs 200 crore.
As of now the input prices have been stable but in case the prices increase the company plans to pass it on to customers, says Khaitan. The overall blended margins for Eveready  have been 10 percent, but the battery category in the current year is likely to post close to 13-14 percent EBITDA margin over last year's 8 percent., he adds.
According to him, the company does not require large capex amount in the near-term although the ad spends for the current year  have increased.
Our investments into the lighting distribution business of CFL, GLS, new age LED bulbs is progressing well and in next three-four years will add substantially to the topline and bottomline. "I would look at it as a very positive investment for the company because the brand extension has been very successful," he adds.
Below is the transcript of Amritanshu Khaitan's interview with Anuj Singhal and Ekta Batra on CNBC-TV18.
Anuj: The last couple of quarters have been good for you because you have been able to hike prices consistently. How is business looking now, and what is the outlook for the rest of the year?
A: The outlook for the year is looking pretty good for the company. The price increases that we had taken have been fully implemented and this showed in Q1 in our operating results partly, and going forward it should reflect very positively in the coming quarters.
Ekta: I understand as of Q1, you had implemented your fourth round of price hikes. After that have you managed to implement any more price hikes in Q2 or do you have any more plans to hike prices?
A: We have taken a price increase in July for our premium AAA batteries to the tune of 5 percent. Apart from which, we keep looking at opportunities where we can increase our realisations and we would look at the second half of the year seeing how the business trend continues. However, as of now, there are no further price increases immediately planned.
Ekta: How has this helped in terms of realisations?
A: For the year currently under review, the company’s free cash flows (FCF) will jump up from around Rs 50-60 crore closer to about Rs 100 crore due to these price increases. This will help us pare down our debt and thereby there will be a strong saving on the interest cost.
Anuj: The input prices continue to rise; I believe zinc prices are still rising. Have you reached a stage where there would be problem in raising prices to compensate for the levels of input price hike and in that case, would you have to compromise on margins going forward?
A: The input prices have been quite stable although zinc had shown a bit of strength in the last two-three months but recently it had again corrected downwards. So, at the current prices, our margins should remain over 10 percent. However, if going forward zinc prices do increase or the rupee does depreciate, we are very confident of passing on further price increases.
We personally do not see the need of taking any substantial price increase at the moment because our margins have increased quite dramatically in the battery category.
When you see Eveready’s margins, overall blended margins are 10 percent but the battery category in the current year will post close to 13-14 percent EBITDA margin, which last year was around 8 percent.
We are seeing at least 500 basis points improvements in margins already. It has been a very substantial increase in the current year. We would want to give a bit of breathing space on the volume front and try and see the growth rate, which the industry has got back after many years and capitalise on that.
Ekta: What about your new products which you had introduced such as lanterns, radios, rechargeable fans, power backups etc? How are those segments doing at this point in time, are they still in gestation period and would they possibly pull down your margins considering that maybe they might have not broken even or you require a large amount of capex?
A: The Company doesn’t require large amount of capex because all these products, which you just mentioned are all outsourced. I agree that these new categories are in a gestation mode but our rechargeable fan being a seasonal product was very successful, we virtually sold out in the summer months.
Lanterns are steady products which are being sold month after month due to the power cut situation.
The real reason why are margins are being a drag is because of the distribution investment that we are putting up to set a lighting distribution catering to the CFL, GLS and the new age LED bulbs which we have launched. The turnover in that category is growing at about 35-40 percent but it is still a small base. Last year we clocked about Rs 140 crore. This year we think we should grow to about Rs 200 crore. So that business is at an EBITDA breakeven level. That is why our margins have contracted a bit.
However, I would look at it as a very positive investment for the company because the brand extension has been very successful - that is a category, which is 5-6 times the battery category growing at about 15-20 percent. So, in the next three-four years that category can add substantially to the topline and bottomline of the company.
Anuj: Give us a word on ad spends. What kind of ad spends would you have to incur over the next few quarters?
A: Our ad spends has increased in the current year. Historically, we have been at about 3 percent of topline and I think this year we should be around 4-4.5 percent but notwithstanding the ad spend increase, our EBITDA margin should still grow by about 200 bps in the current fiscal and that should reflect very positively on the bottomline.
Ekta: You did mention that you will use your free cash flow to reduce maybe your debt levels to a certain extent as well. You have been averaging around more than Rs 8 crore in terms of interest cost on a quarterly basis or at least as of Q1, could you give us a sense in terms of your total consolidated debt, how much would you like to reduce it by?
A: Our consolidated debt for this year should come to below Rs 200 crore. Part of that cash flows is being used to pare down debt, part of the cash flows is being used to buy one of our key raw materials zinc on cash. So the way I look at it is that our interest cost last year was around Rs 41 crore. A combination of these two things should bring our interest cost down to around Rs 30 crore and thereby our profit before tax (PBT) numbers will substantially jump from around Rs 10 crore last year to around Rs 50 crore for this fiscal.

New Delhi, Sept 22:  
Tracking a weak global trend, gold prices fell 0.36 per cent to Rs 26,605 per 10 grams at the futures market today as speculators trimmed their positions.
On the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in December was down by Rs 95 or 0.36 per cent to Rs 26,605 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 26 lots.
Similarly, the yellow metal for delivery in October lost Rs 90 or 0.32 per cent to Rs 26,406 per 10 grams in 354 lots.
Analysts said the fall in gold futures was mostly in line with a weak trend in the global market, where the metal prices fell to an eight-month low as the outlook for higher US borrowing costs strengthened the dollar, dampening the demand for a store of value.
Meanwhile, gold prices in Singapore dropped as much as 0.6 per cent to $1,208.40 an ounce, the lowest price since January 2.

Top cops divided on ‘love jihad’

Discussion on Internet forum turns heated
“Love jihad” may be merely a fear fantasy of Hindutva propagandists, but the campaign has struck a chord with several senior police officers across the country.
Such is the traction that “love jihad”— the notion that there is a global Islamist conspiracy to seduce Hindu women and convert them to Islam — has gained among a section of Indian Police Service (IPS) officers that a debate on the subject on “TopCop,” a discussion forum on Yahoo!, had to be discontinued after some members turned vituperative against Muslims and Islam.
Serving and retired IPS officers are members of the TopCop Internet forum and The Hindu was allowed access by one of them who found the trend “disturbing and alarming.”
“What is shocking is not to know that such prejudices exist among us because we knew that always. That IPS officers can say such things with such brazenness adds another dimension, which is new,” the officer told The Hindu.
“‘Love jihad’ exists. It is a reality… Hindu girls are marrying Muslim boys. It is not a two-way traffic. That would be termed a secular drift,” one post by a 1965-batch officer read.
“’Love Jihad’ as a phenomenon is true and correct as an organised crime,” an officer of the 2003 batch, who spent two years in Uttar Pradesh, said. Though the uniformed supporters of “love jihad” ignored questions from their colleagues on whether any statistics or proof existed to prove such allegations, there were several officers who condemned these views. “What is this us and them? I hope you remember the oath you took when you entered service,” an officer of the 1996 batch wrote chiding the 2003-batch officer quoted earlier.
Some support ‘Love jihad’ theory, but many don’t
The moderator of TopCop, an Internet discussion forum of serving and retired IPS officers, called for the discontinuation of a debate on “love jihad” this week, with the comment that it was turning into a “reiteration of deeply held views and has the potential to become more acerbic.” “I would therefore request all to close this topic and move on.”
While a section of officials declared its approval of the Sangh Parivar campaign on “love jihad,” several officials questioned the argument. An official of the 1990 batch, who has interviewed 49 militant jihadis, said he found no evidence supporting the allegation. “This is not part of any Islamist doctrine, ideology or stated agenda. In fact, what you find is a highly puritanical approach that views any such romantic inclination as sin and grossly abhorrent,” he said.
Another officer from West Bengal wrote: “Even if a large number of Hindu girls are marrying Muslim boys and converting to Islam, what can be the problem for the community and the police. Every adult individual is free to make his or her choices in the matters so subjective and personal as falling in love and getting married.”
While the debate is on love jihad, one participant takes it to a different plane by inviting attention to an alleged “sexual jihad,” “being embraced, apparently voluntarily, by many young Muslim women across the Islamic world.” Offering what he believes is a more balanced view, a 1986-batch officer from Telangana said: “The believing young men who try to convert their non-believing girlfriends before marriage just wish to secure their place in heaven and may have no malicious intention personally.”
But resistance to Muslim boys marrying Hindu girls is not a preserve of the Hindutva right alone, as one officer of the West Bengal cadre narrates.
“During my tenure as SP, one progressive Minister’s relative fell in love with a Muslim boy and changed her religion to expedite marriage under Islamic practice. All progressiveness of the Minister vanished and he put pressure on me through an ADG to arrest the boy and his father.
When I refused to obey the illegal order, the ADG threatened me of consequences.”

T.N., Karnataka forces discuss security for September 27
With a special court in Bangalore set to pass its judgment on September 27 in the disproportionate assets case against Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and three others, senior police officials of the two States met over the weekend to discuss security issues that could crop up immediately after the verdict.
Inspector-General of Police (Intelligence) and Superintendent of Police (Security) and others from Tamil Nadu took part in a high-level meeting convened by the Karnataka police on Saturday. As Ms. Jayalalithaa is under Z-plus security, issues relating to her protection and threat perceptions were analysed, police officials said.
Though the judgment was originally slated for September 20, it was postponed by a week after Ms. Jayalalithaa filed a petition seeking to shift the venue to a suitable location citing security reasons. “The meeting was to review the security arrangements at ‘Gandhi Bhavan’, near Parappana Agrahara central prison, where the special court Judge will pronounce the verdict. Such advance security liaison exercises are done ahead of VVIP visits to a place. An Additional Commissioner of Police from Bangalore was here on Sunday,” a senior police official told The Hindu.
“The venue [of the judgment] is a small place and there will be strict access-control… even journalists will be kept at a distance,” he said.
Highly placed official sources said the police had instructions to ensure that there was no untoward incident in the State irrespective of the outcome in the case. Police officials across the State, particularly those in districts bordering Karnataka, were told to make sure that normal life remains unaffected.

September 22, 2014
During the mid-twentieth century in India, my grandfather did something that was not unheard of—he selected the careers of his six sons. In accordance with what he thought were their strengths and what he believed to be respectable occupations that would enable them to provide well for their families, he decided two should be engineers, two should be doctors, and two should be accountants. And so it was written and so it was done.
Cut to Canada and the later twentieth century. I had an indulgent father. When, after trying to find myself, I did an undergraduate in psychology, my grandfather was perplexed. It was only after I accidentally strayed into an MBA that I somewhat redeemed myself in his eyes and his worries over my future reduced.
The east and west were very different in this respect and understandably so.
In recently independent India, leaders with goals of industrialisation were promoting technology and science, and setting up institutions like the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and the Indian Institutes of Technology. Careers were selected not by individual interest but rather by what you were capable of and what could afford you the best living. In a densely populated country with limited opportunities and vast inequalities, this strategy seemed the best route if not to prosperity then at least to a sustainable future. Beginning early in school, science and math were given the greatest prestige. Later, the smartest youngsters were channeled into engineering and medicine. In the hierarchy, next came the pure sciences, headed by physics. Then any math-related commerce courses, like finance and accounting. The rest had to make do with the humanities.
An equal society
Canada however already had all the fruits of the industrial revolution and a high standard of living. Life was good and looked as though it would only improve for each successive generation. In a country where a university professor may well be living next door to a plumber, the struggle to get specifically into engineering school did not seem worthwhile. After all, both professor and plumber could afford a car, a house, and yearly vacations, and probably both sent their kids to the same government-funded neighbourhood school. Most tellingly, both were accorded equal respect by society and were likely friends on a social level too. No doubt, this is a sign of a more affluent and equitable society where all forms of work were evenly valued.
Now, both east and west, seem to be shifting their attitudes.
Western newspapers and magazines are brimming with talk of STEM courses—meaning Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. While the Council of Canadian Academies is assessing the nation’s status in STEM skills , the Canadian government is funding a Youth STEM Initiative to encourage school children to pursue careers in STEM fields. The US Department of Education has a national strategy to increase the number of graduates in STEM fields , assisted by NGOs such as the STEM Academy and Project Lead The Way. Even the Boy Scouts have gotten into the act; in both countries, the organization is rolling out an awards program to raise interest in the STEM fields. The UK has already established a National STEM Centre which promotes STEM education in schools and colleges, as well as supports careers in STEM fields . The Guardian newspaper reports that during 2013-14, a record number of students were accepted into undergraduate STEM courses in the UK.
 Suddenly in the East, it’s okay not to be an engineer or even to try to be an engineer. 
Suddenly in the West, nerdy means cool. STEM equals success, or at least employment. STEM courses seem to help both the individual as well as the national agenda. The individual is more likely to get a job and earn well—essentially what my grandfather wanted for his sons. And with more such individuals, the country hopes to be more competitive on the global platform.
Meanwhile, in India, newspapers are printing articles about alternate careers. The ‘engineering or bust’ mentality is no longer all-pervasive among kids. We’re beginning to hear of youngsters going—not because of lack of option but willingly—into the humanities, not to mention into careers that were absolutely off the map just a few years ago, like modelling and DJ-ing and the arts. And upon hearing such news, not all parents are thinking of it as economic suicide, not all friends are immediately offering their condolences, and not all of society is labelling them as social pariahs. Suddenly in the East, it’s okay not to be an engineer or even to try to be an engineer.
Calculus and economic confidence
The focus or lack of focus on STEM courses seems to be a reflection of a nation’s economic confidence.
In a country ascending in economic power, the people are open to taking more risk. Over the last 20 years, India has been experiencing high annual growth rates—sometimes up to 9%—and over that course has developed a thriving middle-class. An ascending country can afford to let its people to do what they want and they, bolstered by increasing affluence, can give rein to their individualism. Although India still has a long ways to go, it’s better off enough to no longer insist that everyone must be an engineer, scientist, or mathematician. Its youth feel that they have the luxury to look outside the fields of STEM.
However, in a country descending in economic power and growing in inequality, it makes strategic sense to retrench and go back to the basics. For example, the US has experienced a long recession and been involved in several expensive wars. And although it is still a superpower, its supremacy is threatened enough to begin active promotion of STEM courses. Enrolment in these courses have been on a steady decline there. A country in an economic downturn needs to provide its people with more guidance—just as perhaps in times of economic constraint, a father needs to help decide what’s best for his sons.  That guidance could be towards a path that will be good for the nation as a whole and individual interest may need to give way a bit to group welfare.
And that may not all be bad. As India—a country that has long idealized STEM courses and is also at home with the concept of arranged marriages—can well understand, it is possible to come to love the career that is picked for you—especially if it comes with more employment opportunities, greater status, higher pay, and a better life.

Now  pay for Google apps and e-books in Airt...Google in talks with Airtel to usher in carrier billing
Jayadevan PK, ET Bureau Sep 22, 2014, 04.00AM IST

Airtel
(If they join hands, then…)
BANGALORE: Internet giant Google is in talks with Airtel to allow customers of the country's largest mobile operator to pay for digital items such as e-books, paid apps and in-app purchases through their service provider.
In a country where millions of smartphone users do not use credit cards, such a tie-up can significantly boost Google's digital goods business, and app developers and content creators will end up earning more.
Two people aware of the talks said Google and Airtel are currently trying to come to an agreement on revenue sharing.
If they join hands, then Google can sell its apps and digital content to Airtel subscribers without having to collect banking details. Airtel has nearly 40 million data subscribers in India, of which 12.5 million are on 3G.
At present, Indian mobile users can pay for their purchases from Google's apps store Google Play through credit cards, debit cards or gift cards.
Experts say 'carrier billing', or the practice of allowing customers to charge their digital purchases directly to their phone bills, has huge potential to boost digital goods business in a place where very few people use credit cards, and many of those who do are not comfortable making digital payments.
"There's only 2% credit card penetration and that way the app economy doesn't make sense. Operator billing is incredibly seamless and has a much wider reach," said Vishal Anand , chief product officer at Newshunt, a news reading application provider that has tied up with mobile operators for carrier billing. Nearly 3.5 million e-books were downloaded on the app in less than five months and a large portion of it was paid for through carrier billing.
Google and Airtel are expected to announce a deal once they agree on revenue sharing and receive regulatory clearance. "Google was asking for as much as 90% of the revenues," one of them said.
Operators have been traditionally taking over 50% of the revenues. However, over the years, operators have been under pressure to pay out more to publishers and developers.
Recently, Vodafone made changes to its revenue sharing policy and said it will share revenues on a 70:30 basis in favour of the content creator.
"Earlier, operators did not realise the potential of such services and did not know how to have interactions with developers. But they have been hiring people with developer relations experience and that's a positive sign," said Sundar Lakshmanan, the co-founder of Ideophone Labs, which has worked with operators for some of its apps.
"If Airtel and Google team up, it can play a significant role in solving the payments problem," he said.
Microsoft has also announced its intention to launch a carrier billing solution for its Windows phone app store in India. The company, which has announced carrier billing deals with telecom operators in other markets such as the Middle East, has not announced any time frame for the India launch.
Google's digital goods and apps business is expected to bring in over $5 billion in revenues by 2017 worldwide.
Currently, it offers carrier billing option to customers in 26 countries, including the US, UK and Singapore. In June, it tied up with UAE-based telco Etisalat to offer carrier billing in the region.
In September last year, Estoniabased mobile payments company Fortumo tied up with Indian carriers, including Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and Tata DoCoMo, for carrier billing. It requires developers to integrate Fortumo to their application to enable carrier billing for in-app purchases.
Bangalore-based Ver Se (the makers of Newshunt), US-based Boku, Bango and venture-backed MoPay also offer carrier billing solutions in the country. In India, mobile operators are required to take a second consent from the user before selling any value-added service to the consumer.

Behind Uddhav hard bargain  sons Mission 150Aditya had declared Sena’s ‘Mission 150’ a few months ago.
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:52 am
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s refusal to settle for anything below 151 Assembly seats in Maharashtra is to reassert not only his own leadership in the state but also to stick to the “mission” announced by his son Aditya Thackeray.
At a conclave held a couple of months ago, Aditya had declared Sena’s ‘Mission 150’ for the Assembly elections — almost on the lines of BJP’s ‘Mission 272’  before the Lok Sabha elections. The booklet titled ‘Mission 150’ was widely circulated at the Sena’s working committee meeting held in Mumbai on Sunday.
Showing the booklet, a senior Sena MP said: “Our insistence on 151 seats is an outcome of the calculated stand taken to ensure Sena emerges as the single largest party and gets the CM post.” With the total seats being 288, any party needs to win at least 144 — the half-way mark — to form government.
Sena leaders said it was not just a game of forming alliance and coming to power as far as the Maharashtra elections were concerned. “It is a big battle to reassert the leadership of Uddhav Thackeray in the state — and also to convey the message that Aditya will carry forward the political legacy of his grandfather Bal Thackeray,” said a Sena leader.
“The decision to put forward inexperienced and young Aditya to meet BJP central leader O P Mathur on Friday was part of the Sena strategy to show the party’s political one-upmanship,” he said.
That Sena did not give much importance to BJP leaders was evident when Uddhav said at the working committee meeting: “The other day, O P Mathur conveyed that they had decided a formula of 135 seats each for Sena and BJP and 18 for the smaller partners. I told them Mathur ‘is here to just take and not give’.”
The contempt with which Uddhav dismissed Mathur has not gone down well with the BJP. Sena strategists said the Maharashtra Assembly elections were being held for the first time in the absence of Bal Thackeray. “To hold its forte, Uddhav has to retain his own identity, and in Thackeray style,” said a leader.
Citing past instances, BJP leaders recalled how often senior party leaders such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L K Advani displayed their reverence for Bal Thackeray by visiting him. “It was based on mutual respect for each other. However, Sena under the leadership of Uddhav expects the BJP to accord same treatment without reciprocating the gestures,” said a BJP leader.

Oppn steps up heat  Raje govt springs into actionChaurakhadi village in Baran district where two children died of malnutrition in end August Malnutrition treatment center in Shahbad. (Source: Maqsood Ahmed)
Written by Sweta Dutta | Shahbad | Posted: September 21, 2014 7:59 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 1:28 am
Since the death of two one-year-old children late last month, Chaurakhadi village, on the state’s border with Madhya Pradesh, has been in the eye of the storm. With the Congress trying to corner the Vasundhara Raje government over alleged malnutrition deaths in her son Dushyant Singh’s constituency, the village bustled with VIP visitors on Sunday ahead of Rajasthan Congress Committee chief Sachin Pilot’s slated visit.
Even as the state government denied that the deaths were due to malnutrition, it sprung into action and admitted 47 Sahariya children to the malnutrition treatment centre in Shahbad since Wednesday.
In Kishanganj, 46 children were admitted to the centre, while nine more were admitted in Mangrol.
The Sahariyas, concentrated in Baran district, are one of the most backward tribes of the state. The Raje government in its previous term had introduced 35 kgs of wheat at subsidised rates for the community. The subsequent Ashok Gehlot government brought in a wholesome package, including ghee, edible oil, pulses etc.
Raje, while doing away with most of the freebies brought in by Gehlot, also dropped the package for the Sahariyas, retaining only the sanction for kerosene and wheat.
Local MLA Lalit Meena, who visited hours before MP Dushyant Singh’s tour, said, “Do you see anyone dying of malnutrition or hunger here? The Opposition wants to politicise the issue and is making false allegations.”
However, Genawati, whose one-year-old son Krishan died last month, said, “It is not easy to find work here and all the subsidies have also stopped. Now we eat only rotis and sometimes manage to get a vegetable.”
Shivraj, who lost his 10-month-old son Rinku, told The Indian Express, “My son died due to acute diarrhoea.”
Meanwhile, Pilot, who is slated to visit on Monday, alleged, “The state government has been living in denial. Malnourished children have poor immunity and are an easy prey to a whole lot of diseases. It is worse that such gross neglect is taking place in the CM and her son’s home turf. What can get worse than children dying of hunger that too in today’s day and age?”

Fed heads may ease Wall Street confusion this week
Fed speakers could end up reassuring bond investors, if they stick with the tack that Yellen took in the press conference—which is, each projection "will change over time and there's a good deal of uncertainty associated with it".

After a Federal Reserve statement and press conference that may have provided more questions than answers, and produced oddly divergent reactions in the stock and bond markets, investors will look to this week's heavy docket of Fed speakers to provide clarity about the future of monetary policy. But whether they will get the clarity they seek is a different matter.
In Wednesday's statement and the press conference that followed it, Fed Chair Janet Yellen "somehow was able to be more dovish than people expected on one hand, and more hawkish than people expected on another. It certainly lacked clarity," said Jim Iuorio of TJM Institutional Services.
The key tension on Wednesday was between the central bank's projections and its actual policy statement. In the statement, the Fed kept the language that it planned to keep the key federal funds rate target ultralow for "a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends," despite speculation that it would lose the phrase.
However, in the projections released alongside the statement, the Fed's median prediction for the fed funds rate at the end of the 2015 is now 1.375 percent, substantially above the 1.125 percent predicted in the June meeting.
Bonds seemed to take that hawkish-sounding message to heart, as yields rose sharply on Wednesday afternoon. But stocks weren't spooked at all, closing a bit higher on Wednesday and continuing the market's mildly bullish trend.
"The marketplace desperately wants clarity and credibility at this critical stage of policy path implementations," wrote David Robin of Newedge. "What they got was mixed messaging confusion and an accelerated tightening timeline. The Fed cannot have it both ways and expect the marketplace to defer to their judgment."

This week, investors will hear from a host of Fed presidents—William Dudley and Narayana Kocherlakota on Monday, Esther George on Tuesday, Loretta Mester and Charles Evans on Wednesday, and Dennis Lockhart on Thursday.
"I think their job is going to be to make the message a little more clear," said Iuorio, who says the speeches will be key to the markets in the week ahead.
The Fed speakers could end up reassuring bond investors, if they stick with the tack that Yellen took in the press conference—which is that each projection "will change over time and there's a good deal of uncertainty associated with it."
"Janet told us!" exclaimed Michael Block of Rhino Trading Partners. "She said, pay more attention to the statement than to the forecast. I don't know how much clearer she could be!"

For Block, the Fed has already made it clear that it will remain dovish for the foreseeable future. And that gives him a reason to be bullish on both equity and bond prices (which move inversely to yields).
"Stocks are catching up to that—when are bonds going to catch up to that? If someone figures out that these forecasts are just an academic game, bonds are going to rally back," he said.
Read More Fleckenstein on missing the rally: 'So what?!'
But Iuorio is taking the other side of the trade.
When Dudley and Kocherlakota speak on Monday, "what I'm expecting from them is slightly guarded hawkishness," he said. "And I think rates are going to go up."
If rates keep rising, the U.S. dollar's incredible rally over the past month is likely to continue, as higher rates make keeping one's money in dollars more attractive than keeping it in other currencies.
But not everyone expects that so-called Fedspeak will have a huge impact at this point. According to Robin, the Fed's words are losing power, because the policy path only becomes more confusing and contradictory with every statement. (In one heuristic indication of how complex the Fed's policy goals have become, on Wednesday, the central bank broke the record for number of words in a statement.)
"I don't think anything the Fed says is going to make any difference or provide any clarity," the bond expert said. "The statement earlier in the week did significant damage to the Fed's messaging capability, and they have lost any level of confidence with the market."

ISRO to test run India s Mars Orbiter Mission s main engine today0
2
Bangalore: India's Mars Orbiter Mission will enter the red planet's atmosphere on September 24. But before that, Indian Space Research Organisation needs to test fire the main engine today, which has been in sleep mode for 10 months.
The team of scientists at ISRO's control room will be the first to get signals from the Mars Orbiter Mission. It was a nail biting 10 hours for the team when the spacecraft suddenly lost contact for a few hours in November 2013. But now, they are ready to see it enter Mars' orbit two days time
V Koteshwara Rao, Scientific Secretary of ISRO, "Of course anxiousness will be there, but at the same time I would like to say we are not tensed up."
#isro #mars mission #mars orbiter mission #mars
The scientists will have to switch on an engine that has been on sleep mode for ten months. And to ensure a hitch-free operation, ISRO scientists have replicated the Marscraft and subjected it to the same conditions of space and Mars, right here on Earth.
S Arunan, Project Director of Mars Orbiter Mission, "We have done a test on the ground with similar hardware that is subject to all the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft conditions and it has been kept in the storage for 300 days. We fired it last week and the performance is as per predictions."
It was a spacecraft that cost less money to build than the making of sci-fi film 'Gravity. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi famously said at Rs 450 crore, ISRO's Marscraft was easily one of the most cost-effective spacecrafts in the world for inter-planetary exploration. While ISRO prides itself on being the budget player in this, it's also looking at collaborating with world players on data and analysis of experiments on Mars.
Even NASA's Mars mission Maven will also reach the red planet around the same time as ISRO's and preliminary efforts are on for a joint working group. But for now India waits to take the 224-million-kilometre leap that will hopefully make it the first Asian country to reach Mars in the first shot.

Trinamool MP slams Jadavpur University student movementThe students of Jadavpur University areprotesting in the wake of alleged police assault of students in the early hours of September 17. (Source: PTI/file)
Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: September 22, 2014 11:26 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 1:08 pm
In controversial comments, Abhishek Banerjee, Trinamool Congress MP and nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, on Monday questioned whether the student protests in Jadavpur University were due to banning of drugs and liquor inside the campus .
“Is this protest due to the banning of drugs, liquor and charas?” he said in a Facebook post.
The comment comes in the backdrop of JU students protesting on the streets of Kolkata demanding the resignation of the VC, the Pro VC and the registrar of the varisty in the wake of alleged police assault of students in the early hours of September 17.
Thousands of students had marched through the city’s streets on Saturday demanding resignation of JU Vice-chancellor Abhijit Chakrabarti and West Bengal Governor K N Tripathi intervened to end the four-day old stalemate in the prestigious educational institution.
Students from Presidency University, Calcutta University and other educational institutions joined the march in a show of solidarity.
JU students have boycotted classes to press the demand  for the VC’s resignation. Those in the mass communication department boycotted their examination on September 18.

Sensex sheds 95 points on profit-taking ahead of September month F&O expirySensex up 116 points; consumer durables, FMCG stocks steal the show
Our Bureau/Agencies
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the green amid weak European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex rose 116.32 points or 0.43 per cent at 27,206.74 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty gained 24.85 points or 0.31 per cent at 8,146.30.
Rajesh Agarwal, Head-Research, Eastern Financiers, in a report said: "Going forward, the Sensex earnings multiple at 17 times FY15 earnings looks a bit stretched, and investors would be better off being cautious as the near term upside looks a little difficult. Some reforms have taken place but the quantum of impact on the bottom-line of corporates needs to be seen. Hot money, lower crude prices, monsoon not turning out to be as bad as was earlier expected, are some of the factors that are driving the markets. While we believe that markets could witness correction in short-term, earnings expansion, government initiatives towards infrastructure and strengthening economic data, provide comfort on the medium-term. We strongly believe that the Government’s pro-growth approach will aid the revival in the economy and would in turn boost equity markets."
Among BSE sectoral indices, consumer durables, FMCG, auto and oil & gas indices were the star-performers and were up 3.12 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.88 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, metal index fell the most by 1.22 per cent, followed by healthcare 0.89 per cent and India infrastructure 0.87 per cent.
Tata Motors, ONGC, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and SBIN were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Cipla, BHEL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Infosys.
Concerns over a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday, while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners' shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 per cent, also took its toll.
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the weekend said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 347.48 at 10:02 a.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.6 per cent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts slid 0.5 per cent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.8 per cent.

New Delhi: In more trouble for Central Bureau Investigation Director Ranjit Sinha, the Supreme Court on Monday asked Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Anand Grover to look into allegations against Sinha in the 2G spectrum allocation case. Senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan has alleged that Sinha met suspects in the high-profile case.

The court has said that all documents including CBI file notings and visitors' register of the Director's residence be given to SPP.
The court has also turned down Sinha's plea that the case filed against him should not be heard and be dismissed. Sinha told court that there has been no interference in any of the cases probed by the CBI.
He added, "Identity of the mole must be disclosed before apex court hears the case further."
The matter has been listed for further hearing on October 10. The court has agreed to hear the NGO's plea for recalling its order by which it had directed that name of whistleblower be revealed.
The NGO has tendered unconditional apology before the Supreme Court for its inability to reveal the name of the whistleblower.

#narendra modi in america #modi meets america #modi #us
Sources familiar with the planning of the Prime Minister's trip to the US told PTI that a visit to the 9/11 memorial in New York, paying floral tribute to the Gandhi Statue in front of Indian Embassy in Washington; going to the Lincoln Memorial and Martin Luther King Jr memorial in the American capital is a near certainty.
The Gandhi Status in front of the Indian Embassy near DuPont Circle here was dedicated on September 16, 2000 during a State Visit of then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the presence of the then US President Bill Clinton. The iconic bronze statue was designed by eminent Indian Gautam Pal and was gifted to the US Government by India.
Dedicated to the nation way back in 1922 in honour of the 16th American President Abraham Lincoln, the Lincoln Memorial is a national monument. President Barack Obama is a frequent visitor to this memorial, which is located at the West End of the National Mall.
Located in the southwest of the National Mall, the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial is the latest of the historic memorials on the National Mall. It was opened to the public on August 22, 2011 by Obama, who is a great follower of Martin Luther King Jr. The leader of the African-American Civil Rights Movement, martin Luther King Jr was a great follower of Mahatma Gandhi.
Modi is scheduled to arrive in Washington on September 29 and leave the city for India a day later on September 30. During his stay in Washington, which would last a little over 24 hours, officials are giving final shape to his hectic to squeeze in time for his visit to these two memorials and the Gandhi Status.
As of now, it looks like that he would be visiting the Lincoln Memorial and the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial on the morning of September 30, before his meeting with President Obama at the White House.
However, his programme has not been sealed in yet, sources said, adding that there might be last minute changes.

Mars Orbiter Mission enters Martian gravitational sphere of influenceIndia's Mars mission a step closer to success with engine test
Reuters
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 22:  
Indian scientists successfully tested the main engine of a spacecraft bound for Mars on Monday and performed a course correction that puts the low-cost project on track to enter the red planet's orbit.
The $74-million mission will attempt to enter orbit around Mars early on Wednesday. If successful, it will be the first time a mission has entered Mars' orbit on its first attempt, enhancing India's position in the global space race.
"Main liquid engine test firing successful ... we had a perfect burn for four seconds as programmed," the state-run Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said on its social media sites.
The engine was tested after being idle for 300 days and will be used with eight small thrusters during orbit entry. Reducing the craft's speed from its current rate of 22 km (13.7 miles) per second would be a key challenge, experts say.
The spacecraft, called Mangalyaan, was launched in November last year.
The project has been embraced by new Prime Minister Narendra Modi who aims to establish India as a bigger player in the more than $300 billion space technology market, even as neighbouring China gives stiff competition with its bigger launchers.
Modi will sit next to scientists at ISRO's command centre in the city of Bangalore on Wednesday during the last phase of the mission, the space agency's scientific secretary V. Koteswara Rao told Reuters.
Rao said a group of about 100 scientists celebrated when the communication signals from craft, that take 12 minutes to reach Earth, showed the engine test was successful.
"It was a joyous moment," Rao said.
Success would make India the fourth space power after the United States, Europe and Russia to orbit or land on the red planet.
"This was a critical test we had to overcome. The mission appears to be near successful now," said Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, an expert on space security at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think-tank.
The Mangalyaan aims to study Mars' surface and mineral composition, and scan its atmosphere for methane, a chemical strongly tied to life on Earth. It cost roughly a tenth of NASA's Mars mission Maven that successfully entered Mars orbit on Sunday.

Many dimensions to stake sale in PSUsMany dimensions to stake sale in PSUs
C. R. L. NARASIMHAN
Tweet
September 22, 2014:  
Just a few days ago, on September 10, the Union Government announced its decision to dilute its stake in three public sector undertakings — Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Coal India (CIL) and National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC). All three are bluechip PSUs in which the Government is by far the dominant stakeholder. At present, the Government owns 89.65 per cent in Coal India, 85.96 per cent in NHPC and 68.94 per cent in ONGC.
The Government plans to sell 10 per cent in Coal India to yield Rs.23,600 crore, 5 per cent in ONGC (estimated realisation Rs.19,000 crore) and 13.3 per cent in NHPC (Rs.3,100 crore). If all goes well, the total realisation from just these three stake sales will exceed Rs.45,000 crore,well past the budgetary estimate of Rs.43,425 crore, under this category.
That would also make it the highest-ever collections under the Government’s disinvestment programme. The previous record was in 2009-10 when the Government sold NTPC and NMDC shares and realised Rs.23,957 crore. To put matters in perspective, CIL’s divestment alone will fetch that much this year.
The Finance Minister has also budgeted for another Rs.15,000 crore through sale of Government’s residuary stake in erstwhile Government companies. Strictly speaking, the shares in this category cannot be compared with those on offer under the disinvestment programme. For example, Government, although having a substantial stake in BALCO, has ceded control to Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta group in a big-bang privatisation. The private party has the right of first refusal but there is a controversy as to how much the Government will get for its residual stake.
Then, there is the matter of getting a proper price for the Government-owned UTI’s holding of some bluechip shares, including Axis Bank and Larsen & Toubro. Any eventual sale of these bulk shares will obviously have to take into account not just their price. The Government ought to be sensitive to charges of playing favourites. Getting back to this year’s disinvestment story, retail investors — defined as those who bid for less than Rs.2 lakh, will get sops, a 20 per cent reservation in the issue, and a 5 per cent discount to the issue price. Surely, employees are bound to get similar concessions and incentives.
Lip service to retail investors
Over several rounds of disinvestment, the Government has sought to incentivise retail participation. The results have been tardy for many reasons.
It is possible the size of the discount is not sufficient. Moreover, the market price of these listed companies starts converging to the issue price, which, in effect, means that the retail investor will lose his advantage almost immediately. This has happened with many issues in the past. Retail investors benefit only by holding on to their shares over the medium-term.
Another relevant issue: notwithstanding the discount, small investors might be hard pressed to invest up to the maximum — in this case Rs.2 lakh in each issue. There will be sundry non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and others financing the issue but, as in the past, retail investors might not be tempted.
A point overlooked is the crucial role that the methodology of public sector sale in attracting different types of investment. Reports speak of the government opting for the offer for sale of shares through the stock exchanges. This is one of the two methods introduced by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) some three years ago to aid the disinvestment process, the other being the institutional placement programme (IPP). Although private companies can also adopt these, it is for the public sector that they are intended.
Through another SEBI stipulation, there should be a minimum public float of at least 25 per cent. Many PSUs have a smaller size of public holding. The Government, which owns substantially more and in a hurry to comply with the SEBI rule, has often resorted to the first method, the offer for sale through the stock exchanges. This is undoubtedly a faster method to the follow-on public offer through a prospectus and involving many time-consuming clearances. But what is good for the PSU and the government need not be retail investor-friendly.
If the Government mops up the nearly Rs.43,500 crore from these offerings, it would be on course to achieve the Budget’s ambitious fiscal deficit target — at 4.1 per cent of GDP. However, the point about disinvestment is that it will unlikely yield similar large receipts in the following years. The high valuations obtaining at present cannot be taken for granted. Nor will similar quality stocks such as from the energy sector will be continuously available.
One other dimension is a larger public shareholding exposes the PSU to market discipline and ushers in greater accountability and transparency.
There is, of course, much that the Government can do to nurture the PSUs. Autonomy for them is a big issue that will weigh with public policy long after the present round of public sector stake sale is completed.

Learning from AlibabaTweet
September 22, 2014:  
The most exciting event of last week was undoubtedly the listing of Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group Holding, on the New York Stock Exchange. The Alibaba share listed at $92.70, a whopping 36 per cent premium to the offer price, proving right analysts who felt that the IPO price was conservative.
The scale of Alibaba’s listing success should be evident from the following: the $21.8 billion it raised (could get close to $25 billion if the issue managers decide to accept the excess subscriptions) was the highest amount ever raised by an internet company in the US. It was much larger than Facebook’s $16 billion and Twitter’s $2 billion.
The valuation of $231 billion that it secured on listing day now makes it the 11th most valuable listed company in the US ahead of the bluest of blue chips such as Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, IBM and Coca Cola.
Jack Ma, who founded Alibaba with $60,000 in an apartment at Hangzhou, south-west of Shanghai, in 1999, is now the richest man in China with a net worth of close to $22 billion.
The 49-year-old former school teacher has not only inspired a thriving start-up culture in China but has also created immense wealth for employees, a number of whom are vested with shares in the company.
Scene in India
In the backdrop of Alibaba’s success, it is tempting to look at the scene in India. Admittedly, there is no comparison between China and India when you consider key numbers such as internet penetration, online buyers and e-commerce sales volumes.
Compared to China’s estimated $180 billion e-commerce market, India’s is a piffling $13 billion, according to a study by KPMG and the Internet and Mobile Association of India. About 70 per cent of India’s market comes from online travel transactions.
India’s internet users number a little over 200 million: China has more than thrice that at 632 million and is projected to touch 850 million by 2015. India is projected to cross the 500-million mark by 2018. The number of online buyers in India is expected to cross the 39-million mark by the end of this year; in contrast, Alibaba alone has 279 million active buyers in China!
There are two ways of looking at these numbers. The first is to fret over how far ahead China’s e-commerce market is and how Indian consumers are still in the brick-and-mortar shopping era. The other, more optimistic way, of looking at the comparative data is to realise the potential that India holds for growth in the e-commerce space. That is exactly the attitude and approach of those such as Flipkart, Jabong, Snapdeal, eBay and Amazon in India.
The optimism seems to have rubbed off on financiers as well — Flipkart bagged $1 billion in funding in July which valued the company at $7 billion. In barely three months since the previous funding round in May, Flipkart’s valuation had more than doubled prompting founder Sachin Bansal to dream of turning into a $100-billion company in the next five years.
Not just Flipkart, its much larger rival, Amazon, has also been stepping on the accelerator in India. Within a day of Flipkart announcing its $1 billion funding, the U.S. e-commerce giant said it would be investing $2 billion in India. Why this burst of optimism in the industry?
For one, the number of online buyers is projected to treble to 128 million by 2018 according to research firm Forrester. If the growth in mobile penetration is any indication, this is a conservative projection given that half of all internet users in India are based on mobile platforms. The competition is to grab as much of the new users as possible.
Yet, where the players could be going wrong in India is on their revenue-first strategy unmindful of profitability. While the likes of Amazon and eBay may have deep pockets, the same cannot be said about their domestic counterparts, the large funding rounds notwithstanding.
Alibaba was smart in its business strategy which ensured that it would be profitable. For instance, with millions of products vying for customer attention on its portal, Alibaba devised options for sellers to advertise on its site and also set up attractive online storefronts for a fee.
It also leveraged on its massive size in terms of registered customers by blocking search engines such as Baidu from trawling its e-commerce portals when users search for shopping options. Perforce, Alibaba forced buyers to approach it directly and thus made its portals attractive for advertisers. Alibaba thus captured the advertisement revenue that would have gone to Baidu otherwise.
While it is understandable that the Flipkarts and the Jabongs may be eyeing Alibaba’s success longingly the fact is that they need to devise similar innovative strategies to turn profitable. Flipkart already boasts of 27 million registered buyers — two-thirds of total online buyers in the country — which can be leveraged to attract advertisers in a bigger way. The Indian e-commerce industry is obviously beginning to take-off.
It will be interesting to watch whether it will eventually spawn a local Alibaba or will it be consumed by giants such as Amazon or eBay. Or who knows, even Alibaba.

Case against Birla  others: CBI seeks time forclarificationsPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:28 pm
The court was hearing the closure report filed by CBI in its FIR lodged against Birla, former Coal Secretary P C Parakh and others.
CBI on Monday sought more time in a Delhi court to give clarifications on queries posed to it in connection with a closure report filed in coal block allocation case in which an FIR was lodged against top industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla and others.
Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) R S Cheema told Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar that the DIG and SP concerned were not available and therefore, he needed some more time to address the arguments in the matter.
The court allowed the submission of Cheema and posted the matter for hearing on October 13.
“SPP seeks more time before addressing arguments. Put up the matter for October 13,” the judge said.
The court was hearing the closure report filed by CBI in its FIR lodged against Birla, former Coal Secretary P C Parakh and others.
On September 12, the court had asked CBI as to what was the hurry in closing the case in which FIR was registered against Birla, Parakh and others.
The observation of the court had come after the investigating officer (IO) in the case had contended that the original minutes of meeting of screening committee, in which Birla-owned Hindalco’s application seeking allocation of coal blocks was dealt with, were “missing”.
The agency had told the court that it has already lodged a PE (preliminary enquiry) regarding the missing documents.
CBI had on August 28 filed a closure report in the case.
The FIR against Birla, Parakh and others was registered in October last year by CBI which had alleged that Parakh had reversed his decision to reject coal block allocation to Hindalco within months “without any valid basis or change in circumstances” and shown “undue favours”.
The FIR relates to allocation of Talabira II and III coal blocks in 2005. CBI had booked Birla, Parakh and other officials of Hindalco under various IPC sections, including criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct on the part of government officials.
In its FIR, the agency had alleged that during the 25th Screening Committee meeting, chaired by Parakh, applications of Hindalco and Indal Industries were rejected for mining in Talabira II and III “citing valid reasons”.

It was opened to the public on August 22, 2011 by Obama, who is a great follower of Martin Luther King Jr.
The leader of the African-American Civil Rights Movement, martin Luther King Jr was a great follower of Mahatma Gandhi.
Modi is scheduled to arrive in Washington on September 29 and leave the city for India a day later on September 30.
During his stay in Washington, which would last a little over 24 hours, officials are giving final shape to his hectic to squeeze in time for his visit to these two memorials and the Gandhi Status.
As of now, it looks like that he would be visiting the Lincoln Memorial and the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial on the morning of September 30, before his meeting with President Obama at the White House.
However, his programme has not been sealed in yet, sources said, adding that there might be last minute changes.

(HTC Global Services plans…)
CHENNAI: The US-based privately held HTC Global Services - an IT services company - is negotiating to buy a healthcare services company while also looking at boutique firms in the mobility (mobile application) space, a senior official has said.
The company is also expanding its operations in the US, India and South Korea .
HTC Global Services plans to add 10,000 more people over couple of year's time. Currently the company has over 6,500 employees, he said.
"We are looking at a company operating in the healthcare space in the US. The company has a turnover of around $160 million. There are couple of suitors for that company some from India," Chary Mudumby, executive vice president, told IANS.
He said if HTC Global Services bags the company, it would help it to grow in the healthcare provider (hospitals) space.
Referring to the recent acquisition of the US-based TriZetto by Cognizant for $2.7 billion, Mudumby said the trend is towards acquisition led growth.
He said Cognizant acquisition of TriZetto will not have negative or positive impact on HTC Global Services.
On the expansion plans in the US, Mudumby said HTC Global Services has acquired a 15-floor property in Michigan and will be shifting some of its operations there.
In India HTC Global Services will focus on the banking, retail and other sectors.

(KTG is in the process of adding…)
MUMBAI: Kochi-based Kitex Garments (KTG) has rallied 20 per cent in trade after Motilal Oswal initiated coverage with a 'Buy' recommendation.
According to the brokerage, the company has diversified its clients mix from a single client in FY09 to five currently, reducing client concentration risk and improving margins.
KTG is in the process of adding some large clients in FY15 apart from deepening business with existing clients like Gerber, Toys R Us , Jockey, Mothercare and Carter's.
The company is in the business of manufacturing and exporting infant garments. It derives 85 per cent of its revenue from the sale of infant garments and the balance 15 per cent from the sale of fabric to Kitex Childrenwear.
"Going forward, KTG intends to improve its revenue mix in favor of high margin clients like Toys R Us, Jockey and Mothercare, who procure high value-added products which will drive continued margin improvement," the report said.
"We expect KTG to post 24.6 per cent revenue CAGR coupled with 700bp margin expansion over FY14-FY17E. Hence, we expect PAT to post 40 per cent CAGR over FY14-17E. With 60 per cent capacity utilization currently, we expect ramp-up of existing capacities and minimal expansion capex," the report said.
"Given strong balance sheet and significant free cash flows, RoCE and RoE should improve from ~37 per cent and 39 per cent respectively to ~58 per cent and 39 per cent over FY14-17E. At CMP, the stock trades at 24.5x FY15E, 16.6x FY16E and 12.4x FY17E EPS," the report added.
Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage with a 'Buy' rating with a target price of Rs 615, an upside of 50 per cent, from its last closing price of Rs 410.
At 10:35 a.m.; the stock was at Rs 459.30, up 12.44 per cent, on the BSE. It touched a high of Rs 462.80 and a low of Rs 426.65 in trade today.

Top 5 mantras to select stocks in a rallying market; see Sensex at 30K this year: ExpertAfrica
("IT is in for a big run if the…)
Investors should focus specifically on the 'Modi Model' as infrastructure and manufacturing spaces are bound to do well in the short to long term, says Raghu Kumar , Cofounder of RKSV, in an exclusive interview with Kshitij Anand of EconomicTimes.com . Excerpts:
Q) Give us five stock ideas that you are still recommending to your clients.
Raghu Kumar: We don't give stock-specific tips to our clients. So from a macro perspective, I would focus on:
1) Sectors instead of stocks. Specifically, the 'Modi Model' infra and manufacturing stocks are bound to do well in the short and long term.
2) IT is in for a big run if the rupee continues to falter. Since the elections, most other sectors fared better than IT. IT stocks may be underpriced. Until the rupee appreciates, India's IT sector will continue to fare well since it is in its backbone and outsourcing to IT firms is unlikely to stop.
3) Internet penetration is booming and will continue to boom. Any company directly related to an online-only model is slated to grow.
4) Mobile penetration is a huge hit. Firms taking advantage of a mobile first approach, such as software companies that produce apps or a firm that is mobile friendly, are slated to do well.
5) Finally, look for small cap companies that are going unnoticed and are big on technology. Any firm that recognizes that technology is the wave of the future and has not deserved the attention it deserves is bound to do well. Capitalize on that idea.
Q) Where do you see the Indian markets (Sensex/Nifty) heading in the next 12 months (December and March 2015). How valuations stack up as compared to historic levels?
Raghu Kumar: Since May, I have stood by my forecast of the Sensex hitting 30,000 by the year of 2014. We can expect some slowdown in the markets in the first quarter of 2015 as FII inflows come to a standstill and the US raises its Federal Funds rate. I would expect a quarterly growth of 3-5%, which would pin the Sensex at around 31,500 levels by the end of March and 35,000 levels at the end of 2015.
Q) With Fed uncertainty at bay, does it mean that a new bull run has started for the Indian markets? Even if the Fed does raise rates in 2015, will it have a major impact on the Indian markets?
Raghu Kumar: Absolutely. Anytime the Fed makes any interest rate decision, it is bound to affect emerging markets around the world, especially the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa ).
The reason is quite simple. When the US decides to raise interest rates , it lures investors around the world to shift their funds. The US has kept rates at 0% since 2008. So it would be a dramatic shift in monetary policy .
That being said, the RBI is taking the right approach by taking preventive actions. It has cut its current account deficit by more than half -- from $87.8 billion to $32.4 billion -- through curbs on gold imports and increases in other duties.
With a stable rupee, a growing GDP and a revival in the markets, coupled with the growing US dollar reserves through high FII inflows, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan stated it the best: "My sense is that even when the Fed withdraws, people, after an initial bout of withdrawal, may consider India a good place to leave their money."
India's repo rate is at a high level of 8%, and it would be unwise to assume a drastic rise in the Federal Funds rate.
Q) Despite infusion of liquidity by the government, the worst is still not over for China. On the other hand, India has managed to revive growth and revive manufacturing output. However, CLSA in its recent report said that the Chinese economy will be as big ($21 trillion) as the US economy by 2020. Do you agree?
Raghu Kumar: In terms of GDP, China's latest quarterly GDP reading came in at 7.5%. Despite high credit infusion, weaker domestic investments and a weakened real estate market , there is still a real possibility that the GDP target of 7.5% will be met on an annual basis by the end of 2014.
Even if China does not meet its target, let's take the best case scenario that China maintains a 7.5% GDP growth through the next 6 years. That pins China's GDP at 15 trillion.
Currently, the US GDP sits at 16.8 trillion, and it is unreasonable to assume that it will experience negative GDP. In fact, the forecast is for its GDP to grow at 3% annually. Therefore, it is unlikely for China to become the world's largest economy by 2020.
Q) Everybody wants to 'sell high and buy low'. But does that always work for traders or investors? Is there a way of gauging the right time to buy or sell? If not, what should investors keep in mind while using this strategy?
Raghu Kumar: The rule of thumb is to always try to buy low and sell high. It would never make sense to consciously try to buy high and sell low! That being said, any investor or trader should know when to exit a trade. When to exit a trade is the single most difficult decision an investor or trader encounters.

BSE Sensex, Nifty Fall Sharply Amid Broad Decline
NDTV | Updated On: September 22, 2014 09:39 (IST)
The Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
BSE Sensex and Nifty moved lower by nearly 0.5 per cent today, tracking weak Asian markets. BSE Sensex was down 138 points to 26,951 while Nifty fell 48 points to 8,073.
All the BSE sectoral indices on the BSE were lower today with strong profit-taking seen in recent outperforming sectors such as banking, pharma, capital goods and IT stocks. Market analysts expect Indian markets to remain volatile this week ahead of the derivative expiry on Thursday.
"The Nifty is likely to see high volatility today as markets have entered the derivatives expiry week. After a sharp bout of short-covering last week, expect profit-taking today as most Asian cues are benign," said market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin.
However, some buying activity was seen in midcap and smallcap stocks. The BSE midcap index was mildly positive while the smallcap index rose nearly 0.4 per cent.
Among major Nifty losers, Sesa Sterlite, Asian Paints, Cipla, Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy's were down over 2 per cent.
In Asian markets, Hong Kong shares were down 1.4 per cent while Japan Nikkei fell 0.80 per cent. Asian shares skidded on Monday as investors awaited data this week that could provide more evidence of a slowdown in China, while the dollar gave back a little of its recent gains.
China's flash manufacturing PMI reading on Tuesday could come in below the 50 level, indicating that manufacturing activity is contracting.
"The psychological effect of a below-50 reading will be significant and consistent with the slew of softer Chinese data over recent weeks." Mitul Kotecha, head of FX strategy Asia-Pacific for Barclays in Singapore, said in a note to clients. (With Agency Inputs)

CBI today sought more time in a Delhi court to give clarifications on queries posed to it in connection with a closure report filed in coal block allocation case in which an FIR was lodged against top industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla and others.
Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) R S Cheema told Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar that the DIG and SP concerned were not available and therefore, he needed some more time to address the arguments in the matter.
Also read: SC asks CBI not to take any final calls in coal scam cases
The court allowed the submission of Cheema and posted the matter for hearing on October 13.
"SPP seeks more time before addressing arguments. Put up the matter for October 13," the judge said. The court was hearing the closure report filed by CBI in its FIR lodged against Birla, former Coal Secretary P C Parakh and others.
On September 12, the court had asked CBI as to what was the hurry in closing the case in which FIR was registered against Birla, Parakh and others.
The observation of the court had come after the investigating officer (IO) in the case had contended that the original minutes of meeting of screening committee, in which Birla-owned Hindalco's application seeking allocation of coal blocks was dealt with, were "missing".

Tesco cuts outlook after finding accounting errorTesco cuts outlook after finding accounting error
Reuters
Tweet
LONDON, Sept 22:  
Tesco has lowered its forecast for first-half profit by 250 million pounds ($408.50 million), its third warning this year, after finding a fault in its accounts, in the latest blow to the reputation of Britain's biggest grocer.
The firm said its Aug. 29 profit warning overstated expected first half profit by 23 per cent, an error discovered during preparations for its forthcoming interim results, which have now been pushed back to Oct. 23, from the previously stated Oct. 1.
Tesco had said on Aug. 29 it expected trading profit for the six months ending Aug. 23 to be in the region of 1.1 billion pounds.
"Tesco has identified an overstatement of its expected profit for the half year, principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs," it said.
"Work is ongoing to establish the extent of these issues and what impact they will have on the full year."
Tesco has asked Deloitte to undertake an independent and comprehensive review of the issues, working closely with Freshfields, its external legal advisers.
The interim results will be the first time the market hears from new Chief Executive Dave Lewis, who succeeded Phil Clarke on Sept. 1.
"We have uncovered a serious issue and have responded accordingly. The chairman and I have acted quickly to establish a comprehensive independent investigation," Lewis said on Monday.
"The board, my colleagues, our customers and I expect Tesco to operate with integrity and transparency and we will take decisive action as the results of the investigation become clear."
With a market valuation of 18.8 billion pounds and over 500,000 employees, Tesco had been the darling of the sector during two decades of uninterrupted earnings growth.
But under Clarke it issued three profit warnings in two and a half years as it lost UK market share to fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as upmarket rivals Waitrose and Marks & Spencer, leaving its share price languishing at decade lows.
The stock closed Friday at 229.8 pence

Delhi: 2 held for raping woman in moving carComments
A 24-year-old woman was allegedly drugged and gang-raped by two men in a moving car on Tuesday night.
Police said they arrested two men who are reportedly known to the victim. A medical examination of the woman confirmed sexual assault.
Police sources said the victim is allegedly an associate of a high-profile woman pimp who had recently filed a case of gang rape against four men at the Hauz Khas police station.
A police officer said the crime came to light at about 2am when an auto-rickshaw driver spotted the woman wandering near the Nehru Place flyover in an intoxicated condition.
As she looked dishevelled and was not able to speak properly, the three-wheeler driver suspected the woman might have been sexually assaulted. He immediately called the police control room to report the matter.
A PCR van reached the spot and rushed the woman to AIIMS. After she regained consciousness, the police recorded her statement. The woman accused two men of drugging and raping her in a moving car.
On her statement, a case of drugging and rape was registered at the Kalkaji police station. The woman said she lives in east Delhi. Her father, who died some years ago, was employed with the Delhi Police.
“On Tuesday evening, she went to the two suspects for some work. They took her along in their car and offered her a cold drink laced with sedatives. When she started feeling drowsy, the two men raped her,” said the officer, quoting the woman’s complaint.
“They dropped her at Nehru Place where she was walking and later noticed by the auto-rickshaw driver,” he added.

Indians Among Top Property Buyers In Dubai
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 19, 2014 15:56 (IST)
Manufacturing Growth May Moderate in December Quarter: Industry Body
New Delhi: Indians constitute a dominating group while buying real estate in Dubai, having invested nearly 10.5 billion UAE dirhams (Rs 17,377 crore at 1 UAE dirham = 16.55 rupees) in the first half of this year, according to a report.
Between January and June 2014, Indians, British, Pakistanis and GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) investors accounted for around four-fifths of all real estate transactions in Dubai.
Citing data from the Dubai Land Department, property consultant Knight Frank said a number of key nationalities including India dominated real estate investment activity in the emirate in the first half of 2014.
During January-June 2014, Indians invested close to AED 10.5 billion (Rs 17,377 crore) in the emirate, while British and Pakistani nationals spent AED 5.8 billion (Rs 9,599 crore) and AED 4.5 billion (Rs 7447.5 crore), respectively.
Overall, the total amount invested in Dubai's property market in the first half of 2014 was AED 50 billion, or Rs 82,750 crore, equivalent to 44 per cent of the sum spent in 2013 as a whole, suggesting that, by last year's standards, realty investment activity has softened in the first half of 2014.
However, the mainstream residential market is outperforming the prime segment in Dubai, mainly because these segments are very popular among western expatriates and continue to see healthy demand, Knight Frank said in its Autumn 2014 Dubai Residential Insight Report.
Secondly, the new mortgage caps had a lesser impact on the mainstream segment and demand situation continued to be robust because of Dubai's strong economic conditions and buoyant labour market.
"We expect demand to outstrip supply in the short-term," the report noted.
"Mainstream residential segment is anticipated to outperform prime over the next 12 months."

An Amazon-Alibaba deal It s possibleAn Amazon-Alibaba deal? It's possible
By Jesse Solomon   @JesseSolomonCNN September 19, 2014: 3:02 PM ET
Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma indicated Friday that he's open to a joint venture with Amazon.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Among other comparisons, Alibaba ( BABA ) is often likened to the Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) of China. But could the two internet giants be friends?
Maybe.
It's a big maybe, but in an interview with Bloomberg News on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Alibaba co-founder and CEO Jack Ma said that he'd be open to a joint venture with the American e-commerce giant.
"I would be interested in talking because as always, anything, anybody that involves helping small business we will feel excited," Ma said.
Related: Alibaba IPO means a big payday for Jack Ma
That line wasn't the clearest signal of open arms, but the prospect of an Alibaba-Amazon partnership got investors immediately giddy. After opening slightly down, Amazon shares shot up 2% Friday. While the market overall pulled back, Amazon is still up about that much in afternoon trading.
Of course, next to the actual Alibaba IPO Friday , the biggest ever on a U.S. exchange, the Amazon jump got little attention.
 
This is how a stock is born
"While Alibaba eats all media channels/headlines, $AMZN has ticked up about 2 percent," said CrosbyVenture on StockTwits .
It's tough to say whether a deal between Alibaba and Amazon makes sense. Ma has made it clear that he intends to expand outside of China, but whether that means he would do so by buying up established companies or by introducing an actual e-commerce platform for American consumers is anyone's guess.
After all, most Americans outside Wall Street haven't even heard of Alibaba.
And despite the comparisons, Amazon and Alibaba are actually pretty different.
Sure, Alibaba and Amazon both do business on the Internet. They both enable consumers to buy huge volumes of goods without stepping foot in a store. And both have a stranglehold on their home markets.
But that's pretty much where the similarities end. Unlike Amazon, Alibaba does not own most of the items sold on its platforms, it does not maintain massive distribution centers, and it has only a fraction of the 132,000 employees on Amazon's books.
Related: Amazon releases new Fire tablets and e-reader
What will happen when Alibaba and Amazon find themselves fighting for the same consumers? Here they are similar: expect both founders to come out swinging.
"Lying behind the massive allure of the capital market, there is unparalleled ruthlessness and pressure," Ma wrote in a letter to employees earlier this year. "In this market, only a small number of outstanding enterprises can maintain a gallop."
CNNMoney reached out to Amazon for comment but has yet to hear back on their view of Ma's statement.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama's military campaign against the Islamic State group already has extended beyond the limits he first outlined.
But military experts inside and outside the administration argue that an even greater expansion may be needed for the mission to succeed, including positioning U.S. ground troops with front-line Iraqi security forces.
Doing that could put Obama close to violating his pledge to keep Americans out of combat.
For Obama, re-engaging in combat in Iraq would mean going back on promises about the current mission and undercutting a pillar of his presidency — ending long wars and avoid new ones.
If commanders request ground troops and he turns them down, Obama could be accused of putting his legacy first.
Obama has shown a willingness to expand the size and scope of the fight against the Islamic State extremist group.
He first announced a limited airstrike campaign, but the U.S. now is pursuing targets across Iraq and is expected to push the attacks into Syria.
About 1,600 U.S. troops have been sent to Iraq to train local security forces and protect U.S. personnel. Soon, the Pentagon will start training and equipping Syrian rebels to fight the militants.
Obama has said that Iraqi security forces, the Kurdish peshmerga and the Syrian opposition fighters will wage ground battles with the Islamic State group. But some of Obama's current and former military advisers have said that unless American troops also participate, it will be difficult to defeat the militants.
"They're not going to be able to be successful against ISIS strictly from the air, or strictly depending on the Iraqi forces or the peshmerga," said Robert Gates, Obama's former defense secretary, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State group. "So there will be boots on the ground if there's to be any hope of success in the strategy."
Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress he would recommend that step if Obama's initial strategy fails. Dempsey also said that about half the Iraqi army is incapable of partnering effectively with the U.S. to combat the Islamic State group, suggesting a high likelihood that more Americans would be needed on the ground.
The president responded swiftly to Dempsey's comments by emphasizing his pledge to keep Americans out of combat missions.
"The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission," Obama told troops at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida. "As your commander in chief, I will not commit you and the rest of our armed forces to fighting another ground war in Iraq."
But White House officials have left open the possibility that Obama could accept a recommendation to put ground troops in forward operating positions alongside Iraqi and peshmerga forces.
While officials say those troops would not be sent with a specific combat mission, they would be armed, as are the 1,600 military personnel sent to Iraq this summer, and would have the authority to fight back if attacked.
Richard Fontaine, president of the Center for New American Security, said that would leave Obama with "something of a rhetorical quandary."
"From a realistic and even legal standpoint, what's going to be happening in Iraq is going to look a lot like combat," said Fontaine, a former State Department official who has advised Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on foreign policy.
While Obama has broad public support for the airstrikes, it's unclear whether the public would approve of an expanded ground mission. A recent CNN/ORC poll found that while 76 percent of Americans back strikes in Iraq and 75 percent support them in Syria, just 38 percent favor sending U.S. ground troops to those countries.
Should Obama have to take that step, the White House's goal would be to ensure that the ground forces were not solely American. Administration officials are pressing other countries, particularly Iraq and Syria's Arab neighbors, to commit ground troops to help bolster local security forces.
Administration officials say they've received positive feedback from Arab nations, but there have yet to be any specific commitments about ground troops or other direct action.
Obama will make further appeals when he arrives in New York Tuesday for meetings with foreign leaders at the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering.

President Barack Obama's military campaign against Islamic State group extremists has already crept beyond the narrow parameters he first outlined three months ago.
But military experts both inside and outside of the administration argue that even more may be needed for the mission to succeed, including embedding U.S. ground troops with Iraqi security forces on the front line of the fight against the violent militants. Taking that step could put Obama dangerously close to violating his repeated pledges to keep Americans out of combat in Iraq.
For Obama, re-engaging in combat in Iraq would not only mark a reversal of his promises with regard to the current mission. It would also undercut one of the broader causes of his presidency— to end lengthy American wars and avoid new ones.

Jaitley to Launch Enhanced Single Window Website for Taxpayers: ReportCommercial Mining of Coal to be Allowed After Auction: Finance Minister
New Delhi: Taxpayers will now be able to perform their income tax-related tasks like filing returns or applying for a PAN card from an enhanced single website to be launched by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday.
An updated version of the existing website of the Income Tax Department - www.incometaxindia.gov.in - will now be acting as a "single window" for all activities and online services offered by the taxmen, officials said.
Taxpayers will be able to file their I-T returns online and even apply for a PAN from this portal which was till now hosted on a different official web address of the department.
"The spruced up website is more robust and can handle the pressure of numerous hits at one time," an official said. It will also be more colourful with different icons marking separate activities as compared to the earlier version which only had two dominant shades of dark blue and white.
The website will also allow taxpayers to know about the I-T Act, various notices and circulars being issued from time to time and regular developments in the department.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had envisaged such a website in its ambitious 'Vision 2020' document prepared a few years ago and the new website will be a culmination of efforts to give better services to taxpayers, they said.
Mr Jaitley will launch the enhanced portal on Monday by the click of a button from his office in North Block, Delhi in the presence of senior CBDT and I-T department officials.
"We are currently performing upgradation and maintenance activities. New upgraded site will be up on 22-09-2014," the website displayed as of Sunday evening.

Customised Android tablet devices make way to India for Rs 5k onwardsPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 21, 2014 8:35 pm | Updated: September 21, 2014 8:49 pm
Challenging the one-size-fits-all approach of leading electronics manufacturers, a home-grown company has brought in a new concept of customised tablets for specific segments like children, women, seniors, professionals and gamers with prices starting at under Rs 5,000.
Besides being customised at the hardware and software levels, these tablets — under the brand name ‘Pinig Tabs’ and powered by Android operating system — would provide ‘managed device’ services to users through the product’s lifecycle.
The company, Pinig Tech, has categorised its tablets as Executive Tab, Kids Tab, Woman Tab, Gaming Tab and Senior Tab for different user groups. The tablets would start at a price of under Rs 5,000 and can go up to Rs 12,800 depending on the configuration that a user requires.
“We are passionate about technology and want to make it easy to use for everybody. You shouldn’t have to be tech-savvy to enjoy all the benefits of technology.
While your 8-month old child can use the Kids Tab for learning numbers and rhymes, your 70-year old dad can use the Senior Tab to watch his grandchildren learn their first words,” Pinig Tech’s co-founder Piyush Nigam said.
These tablets would come with a range of apps selected on the basis of the needs of the target user, while ensuring compatibility with a particular device’s configuration.
The company said that Pinig Tab would be a ‘managed device’, which means that it automatically upgrades chosen apps as and when a new version of the app is released.
The company has also lined up big plans for the upcoming festive season, while it is also in talks with leading e-commerce sites for exclusive associations.
Besides, Pinig aims to tap social media platforms and schools to promote these tabs.
Apart from discounts, Pinig would be offering festive packs that include branded tablet covers, earphones, 3G dongle and other accessories.
Rise of smartphones with large screen has eaten into the global tablet and 2-in-1 market with shipment growing just 3.9 per cent to 50.4 million units in the January-March quarter, research firm IDC said.
Slow growth across commercial and consumer segments saw sales of players like Apple, Asus and Amazon also falling.

Smart science  smarter businessSmart science, smarter business
Arijit Paladhi |  Sep 22, 2014 12:48 AM IST
The building housing Vyome Biosciences in the Patparganj area of Delhi looks nondescript, belying the activities of the 35-member team inside. At the office, scientists inoculate product molecules on petri dishes of fungi and bacteria inside the aseptic enclosure of a Laminar Air-Flow Chamber.
Seeking to increase the efficacy of product molecules, the bio-pharmaceutical start-up is generating huge interest in the dermatology segment. Since its conception, it has recorded about $12 million in investment, the latest about a month ago, though it hasn't generated any revenue yet.
"For decades, there has not been much focus on novel product development in acne and dandruff. It's an untapped area, with a global market worth billions. This is the segment Vyome will cater to with its prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC) products," says Alok Samtaney, investment director, Sabre Partners, which has led an investment of about $8 million (Rs 50 crore), along with co-investors Kalaari Capital, Aarin Capital and Navam Capital, in a recent series-B funding in the company.
FOUNDERS' BACKGROUND
Shiladitya Sengupta
Assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, serial entrepreneur and has co-founded four companies. One of his ventures, Cerulean Pharma, debuted on NASDAQ earlier this year
Rajesh Gokhale
Director at Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. Recipient of the Infosys Prize in life sciences for his discovery of crucial enzymes which are necessary for the synthesis of the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Rajeev Mantri
Executive director at Navam Capital. Been a columnist for The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Forbes and Mint
N Venkat
Former CEO at Emami and ex-President at Cavin Kare, Shantha Biotech and Aurobindo Pharma. Philosophical musings interest Venkat and he likes delving into Indian philosophy
The dermatology sector is estimated at $20-25 billion, with products for acne and dandruff accounting for a considerable chunk of that.
The beginning
In 2009, at the Young Investigator Meeting in Boston, an annual event offering opportunities to young researchers to work in and for India, Rajesh Gokhale and Shiladitya Sengupta got talking. "The discussion moved to how there was a systemic lack of innovation in the dermatology space for decades now. Somehow, that nascent idea fructified through the next year or so," says Sengupta, chairman of the Board of Directors at Vyome and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
In 2010, Vyome Biosciences was founded by Shiladitya Sengupta, Rajesh Gokhale and Rajeev Mantri. Rajesh Gokhale, the co-founder and director of the company, is also the director at Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi; earlier, Mantri, also co-founder and director at Vyome, had worked at New York-based Lux Capital. N Venkat, former chief executive at Emami and president at Cavin Kare, Shantha Biotech and Aurobindo Pharma, was brought on board in 2013.
The pre-series A-funding involved a lot of bootstrapping, with Sengupta's father assembling furniture for the office, which was an ex-gutkha factory. The seed investment of $1 million came from Navam Capital, funded by Mantri's family-run, Kolkata-based investment firm GPSK Investment Group.
In 2012, through series-A funding, the company raised $3.3 million from Kalaari Capital (formerly known as IndoUS Venture Partners), Aarin Capital and Navam Capital.
With five platform technologies patented and a couple of OTC drugs recently concluding clinical trials, licensing and revenue generation is the next step. "Once licensing of the Rx and OTC products happens, revenue will start flowing. We're expecting OTC licensing in a few quarters. Rx products are still a few years down the line, as it takes longer to develop these," says Venkat, chief executive of Vyome.
Though Vyome is the first innovation-oriented company in the dermatology sector in India, it is one of the many on a global scale. Others in this space include Galderma, Allergan, Pfizer, GSK, Merck, Roche and Sanofi.
The model predominant among other smaller global players involves developing a new product to any stage - from phase I to phase-III, while bearing all the risk - and subsequently cashing out or being acquired by a larger player.
The business model entails a recursive loop of investment - licensing or partnership, product release and subsequent royalties.
"The first few years involve investment in developing platforms, products and technologies which have a value inflexion point for a licensing opportunity. Other products also reach development stage, in parallel. Therefore, it becomes a recurrent cycle of products, platform maturity, licensing and royalties," says Venkat.
Investors and analysts say it is usual for drug research companies to see large investments being sunk before recovery. Experts say costs of $6-11 million are common in developing a new product to the second phase of clinical trials.
Focus
"It's exciting to be a part of knowledge monetisation. We're combining genomics and nanotechnology to create wealth," says Raghunath Mashelkar, former director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and part of Vyome's board of directors.
Vyome sounds upbeat about its new technology being subsumed by global consumer product brands or pharma companies. "The acne or dandruff products you see today are palliative in nature. For instance, they remove dandruff flakes instead of acting on the fungi, which continues to proliferate and facilitate flake regeneration. Our research scientifically targets the fungi. It's the science that will help us grow," says Sengupta.
The road ahead
For any innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company, scalability is a challenge, due to a multitude of factors that can stymie innovation. With two OTC products, which it hopes to license out a few quarters down the line, and a couple of Rx products in the pre-clinical stages, Vyome is looking at potential suitors by early 2016.
"It's premature to close any possibilities at this stage. However, as of now, our plan entails developing technology and licensing it to major brands. Beyond that, we will see what the future brings," says Mantri.
For Vyome, the primary challenge is the seeming lack of innovation in the dermatology sector for it to innovate and build upon. Paradoxically, this is also something it stands to gain from. If it can, that is.
EXPERT TAKE
Vyome Biosciences has a dynamic scientific team, one of the primary reasons why it can succeed. In Sengupta and Gokhale, it has two scientists who understand the science they're applying to developing products. When you start developing a product from scratch, innovation-based product development is a tricky and long-drawn business proposal. What Vyome is doing is re-purposing extant molecules and improving their delivery mechanism to sites, which is smart science. However, there are challenges in the transition from successful clinical trials to product delivery. Due to paucity of innovation in the global dermatology sector, it is now a market waiting to be tapped into. With both OTC and prescription products on the anvil, the company's science will be the key driver for growth and scalability.
Shekhar Mitra is former senior VP of global R&D at P&G. He also serves on the scientific advisory board of Vyome Biosciences

Two Indian-origin recruiters working for ISIS  al-Qaeda: OfficialsPrint
Written by Johnson T A | Bangalore | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:37 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 9:29 am
Inestigations in Jaipur and Hyderabad into recent attempts by global jihadi outfits to recruit Indian youths has revealed the presence of at least two Indian -origin recruiters on the Internet luring youths on behalf of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS or IS) and al-Qaeda, and working in collaboration with each other.
Former Bhatkal native Abdul Khader Sultan Armar, 38, who is believed to be currently based on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and associated with the Ansar ul-Tawhid ul-Hind has emerged as a common al-Qaeda-linked recruiter in both the Jaipur and Hyderabad investigations.
Besides, a former SIMI man from Karnataka currently said to be based in the Gulf region has been identified as a recruiter for the ISIS and as the one who recently attempted to recruit four Hyderabad youths via the Internet. Sources said he has been found to be in touch online with several youths from India.
The discovery of the two Indian-origin recruiters was confirmed by sources in multiple agencies involved in tracking terrorism. It was Armar who recently made a call to Indians to join global jihad in an Ansar ul-Tawhid online video. Armar is wanted in India and has an Interpol Red Corner Notice against his name in connection with a grand terrorism conspiracy case booked against him and other members of the Indian Mujahideen outfit by the National Investigation Agency.
However, the alleged IS recruiter has not been named in any recent case in India. His name had featured in investigations into activities of the banned SIMI in Karnataka in 2007, but he had not been booked, sources said.
“The emergence of a former SIMI-linked man from Karnataka in the Hyderabad probe into recruitments for the IS is a concern. It is being examined,” a senior Karnataka Police official said.
In the Hyderabad case, the four youths, all engineering students in their early 20s, were detained in West Bengal allegedly in the process of leaving India to join the ISIS.
The Jaipur case involved three youths — Mohammed Mahruf, 21, Mohammed Waqar Azhar alias Haneef, 21, both engineering students and residents of Jaipur, and Shaquib Ansari alias Khalid, 25, a DTP business operator and a resident of Jodhpur — who were arrested on March 23 for alleged terror links.
Investigations following the arrest of the three revealed that they were allegedly lured into taking up jihad by Sultan Armar, who first established contact with them on Facebook via a fake identity, before drawing them into password-protected forums for further discussions including video chat.
The three Rajasthan youths were reportedly then put in touch with alleged Indian Mujahideen operative Tehseen Akhtar alias Monu. It was Akhtar’s arrest that led investigating agencies to them.
Investigators allege that the four Hyderabad youths were initially handled online by the Karnataka-origin ex-SIMI man based in the Gulf.
According to officials, six youths from Hyderabad were first contacted online and “brainwashed” continued…

Crucial wake-up call for Isro s Mangalyaan today ahead of entry into Mars orbitComments
With  less than 48 hours left before the spacecraft enters Mars’ orbit, scientists of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) have successfully test-fired its liquid engine.
Before the test-firing, Annadurai, programme director at Isro, told Hindustan Times: “The test firing is like a trial. The dormant engine has to be brought back to life. It is a challenge but if one is prepared well for the exam, the confidence for success is higher.”
The nail-biting prelim was carried out at 2:30pm when the craft’s 440 Newton Liquid Apogee Motor engine, which has been idle for 300 days, was fired up for four seconds. The fourth and final trajectory corrections were also made.
“The engine will be fired for nearly 4 seconds and almost half a kg of fuel will be needed for this operation,” says Koteshwar Rao, scientific secretary, Isro before the test-firing
On September 24 it will be put in action along with eight thrusters to slow down Mangalyaan so it can be injected into a safe orbit around the Red Planet.
Isro launched the Mangalyaan on November 5 to find evidence of life on Mars. If the spacecraft makes it, India will be the fourth after US, Russia and Europe to reach the Red planet. Once in orbit, the craft’s five payloads will take pictures and collect data for the next six months.
Probes to Mars have a high failure rate. Of the 51 missions so far, only 21 have succeeded. A similar mission by China failed in 2011.

RSS rewrites history: Dalits  created  by Muslim invadersComments
In its renewed impetus to woo Dalits, various other castes and sub-castes, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has embarked on an ambitious exercise to re-write history.
Emboldened by the BJP’s success in the Lok Sabha elections, the RSS has intensified its efforts to find and validate a common Hindu thread to unify all groups under one Hindu identity.
Three top RSS leaders have sought to attribute the genesis of Dalits, tribals and many other groups to “Muslim invasion” in medieval times.
 They articulated these views in their forewords to three books, authored by BJP spokesman Vijay Sonkar Shastri and released by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat recently — “Hindu Charmakar Jati”, “Hindu Khatik Jati” and “Hindu Valmiki Jati”.
The Sangh leaders claimed that these castes had come into existence due to atrocities by foreign invaders and did not exist in Hindu religion earlier.
According to Bhaiyyaji Joshi, No.2 in RSS hierarchy, ‘shudras’ were never untouchables in Hindu scriptures. ‘Islamic atrocities’ during the medieval age resulted in the emergence of untouchables, Dalits and Indian Muslims.
Joshi further elaborated, “To violate Hindu swabhiman (dignity) of Chanwarvanshiya Kshatriyas, foreign invaders from Arab, Muslim rulers and beef-eaters, forced them to do abominable works like killing cows, skinning them and throwing their carcasses in deserted places. Foreign invaders thus created a caste of charma-karma (dealing with skin) by giving such works as punishment to proud Hindu prisoners.”
Another top RSS functionary, Suresh Soni, echoed the same: “Dalits had their genesis during Turks, Muslims and Mughal eras. Today’s castes like Valmikis, Sudarshan, Majhabi Sikhs and their 624 sub-castes came into being as a result of atrocities against Brahmins and Kshatriyas during Medieval or Islamic age,” he wrote.
Krishna Gopal, Sah-sarkaryavah, RSS, went on to bolster the Sangh’s new found agenda saying, “In pre-historic and Vedic age, Khatik castes have been recognized as Brahmins who affected sacrifices. It may be noted that before the advent of Muslim invaders, there is no reference to rearing pigs in India.
It was a vocation adopted by Hindus to defend their religion.”
The RSS has been focusing on research in this area of late. One of its affiliated organisations had recently organised a conclave of over 100 historians to discuss historiography and changes required to give a proper perspective.
An overarching Hindu identity beyond any castes or sub-castes is an objective that the RSS has been striving for decades, despite being projected as an upper caste outfit. The BJP itself, under the stewardship of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, has been actively reaching out to Dalits and OBCs. The Sangh’s latest move looks set to re-ignite a debate on history and historians.

Can any Indian co replicate Alibaba s success | Its m-cap=TCS+ONGC+RIL+ITCAlibaba
(While India ticks all the…)
NEW DELHI/BANGALORE: When an online commerce company set up by a former English teacher in China makes a stunning debut on the US bourses, questions are bound to arise as to whether an Indian player can replicate the success.
While success in entrepreneurship is largely due to individual brilliance — as is evident from Alibaba's and its founder Jack Ma's spectacular IPO last week — other factors, including investment climate and government regulations, do play a key part.
Hangzhou, China-based Alibaba's shares soared almost 40% in its first day of trading on New York Stock Exchange as investors fought over a piece of what is expected to be the largest IPO in history
While India ticks all the right boxes when it comes to demand and potential for growth, the jury is out if an Indian ecommerce player would be able to do what Alibaba did within the next few years.
Industry pundits point out that India's ecommerce sector is at a stage where China was in 2007, but a combination of factors — such as low Internet penetration, supply chain and logistics hurdles and an archaic regulatory regime — act as barriers. "One cannot have this scale if you don't think of going global.
I don't see any company in India working toward that right now," said Rachna Nath, leader of retail and consumer at PricewaterhouseCoopers India. "That is the need of the hour."
 
According to a recent report by investment bank Avendus Capital, India's online commerce sector, currently valued at $3.1 billion (Rs 18,800 crore), is expected to gross about $5 billion (Rs 30,500 crore) by end of the current year, and is projected to hit over $11.8 billion (Rs 71,800 crore) in sales by end of 2015.
Impressive, but still tiny compared with the $542 billion (Rs 33 lakh crore) that China's ecommerce, which contributes more than 3% to the country's GDP, is expected to touch by 2015. "It's unfair to expect that we will produce a company the size of Alibaba right away, given the difference in basic denominators, such as GDP and retail market size of the two countries," said Kunal Bahl, co-founder and chief executive of Snapdeal.
According to Bahl, the strategy is to build an ecommerce company for the Indian market, and not to ape existing business models. "If you went to China in 2007-08, you would be asking the same questions of them, as you're asking about India's ecommerce sector now," said Bahl.
"It's not common to see billion- dollar businesses growing 300- 400% year-on-year. It's an unusual thing. I don't think there's any other industry in India growing at that kind of pace."
Regulatory roadblocks, however, continue to be a cause for concern, with Amazon India's recent tax issues with the Karnataka government highlighting the dissonance between prevailing tax norms and the demands of growth.
"The Centre needs to address a whole gamut of tax-related issues for retail industry, not just ecommerce. Otherwise, the ecommerce firms will be at the mercy of local tax officials in different states," said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail advisory firm Technopak.
High cost of customer acquisition incurred by India's ecommerce companies, adding to already-significant burn rates, is also a cause for concern. The average aggregate cost of acquiring users is estimated at between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.
"Establishing 'stickiness' is going to be an issue. There will always be margin pressure to keep prices low, given that customers tend to switch easily," said Ajay Relan, founder and managing partner of private equity firm CX Partners.
On a per-dollar basis, private equity investors earn more from their investments in China than in India.
Barriers notwithstanding, bigger ecommerce ventures in the country such as Bangalore-based Flipkart and Delhi-based Snapdeal, are building up technology platforms investing in infrastructure. "Reach is still limited. What is really desirable is the ability to deliver, manage logistics," said PwC's Nath.
In May, Snapdeal launched 40 fulfilment centres or warehouses across 15 cities, and said it plans on launching more over the next few months. Rival Flipkart runs about six such warehouses.
Both companies have crossed gross merchandise value (GMV), or value of goods sold on their website, of $1 billion (Rs 6,000 crore) in the past few months. This, however, pales in comparison to Alibaba, which reported GMV of $248 billion (Rs 15 lakh crore) for the previous fiscal, according to its draft red herring prospectus.
With the desktop revolution bypassing India, Snapdeal and Flipkart, along with their peers, are focusing on the mobile platform to drive deeper penetration in the country. India currently has a mobile subscriber base of over 900 million, one of the largest in the world.
"3G prices have been coming down and the growth of smartphones makes it very clear there will be a tsunami of new users going forward," pointed out Bahl.
Both Flipkart and Snapdeal see more than 50% of their overall orders coming from mobile. It's a strategy that has been accepted by global private equity and strategic investors, as they continue to pour money into the space. While Flipkart raised a massive $1 billion in financing in July, Snapdeal is also believed to have closed its latest funding round led by Alibaba and Japanese investor SoftBank.
Amazon chief Jeff Bezos has also committed $2 billion (Rs 12,000 crore) towards the e-tailer's Indian unit. "For Amazon, due to regulations in China, India is the only emerging market still open and it will never let go of that opportunity," said Rahul Khanna, MD at Canaan Partners, which has companies such as Naaptol and BharatMatrimony in its portfolio. "An Alibaba or not, we will see at least $5 billion companies from India in next 10 years."

Google Fibre clone: How Sterlite plans to provide high speed internet in 20 citiesAirtel
(Under its build-to-demand…)
KOLKATA: Telecom engineers and fibre specialists at Vedanta Group company Sterlite Technologies are finalising the 'proof of concept' of a close variant of the 'Google Fibre' project to transform the urban home broadband experience in India's top 20 cities and, in turn, boost high-speed internet penetration.
But unlike the US search giant, which will directly take its ultrafast fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) drive across US cities, Sterlite will deliver super-fast fibre broadband connectivity at 20 to 50 Mbps speeds to urban homes through partner mobile operators.
"We will shortly showcase our FTTH broadband technology blueprint to Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices to line up the first wave of partnerships," Sterlite Technologies CEO Anand Agarwal told ET. The company is initially looking to hook up a million homes by 2016 across Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Chennai.
"Sterlite's faster home broadband model has parallels with the Google Fibre project as the network and services to end consumers would be similar, but company roles will be different as we plan to work with telcos as catalyst-cumsystem integrators to create a pan-India urban broadband network, unlike Google, which will directly serve US consumers as an internet service provider," said Agarwal.
Its plan to partner with telcos comes at a time when mobile operators are increasingly focusing on data revenues to fuel future growth.
"A faster fibre broadband option along the lines of a 'Google Fibre' can be handy for incumbents Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India or Idea Cellular, which are known to be cherry picking lucrative data customers in urban zones in anticipation of intense competition from Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio Infocomm, which is reckoned to launch its 4G voice and data services by March next year," a Mumbaibased sector analyst said, requesting anonymity.
At present, Google's ultra-fast fibre internet service is reportedly available in Kansas City and Provo, Utah, and will be expanded soon to Austin, Texas. According to international news reports, Google plans to take its faster home broadband service to some 34 US cities shortly.
Elaborating on Sterlite's fibre broadband model, Agarwal said the company would deliver last mile broadband connectivity to an urban home by plugging its FTTH network to the nearest point of interconnect (PoI) of a partner mobile operator, which could be an exchange or base station.
Agarwal, however, agreed that Sterlite's FTTH network expansion would hinge on telco demand for using its fibre-to-home technology. "We will ink revenue-sharing pacts with telco partners only after jointly assessing whether a particular urban neighbourhood is ready for fibre," he said.
Under its build-to-demand approach, the company will extend last mile fibre optic internet connectivity to individual homes and residential high rises only after "it is assured of adequate demand for faster broadband services at the consumer end".
Incidentally, Sterlite Technologies is a key optic fibre cable supplier for the Rs 21,000-crore national optic fibre network (NOFN) project that will be take high-speed internet to 2.5 lakh village blocks across the country. It has also secured contracts to supply such cables for a mega telecom network that BSNL is building for the armed forces.

UN chief Ban Ki-moon and Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio joined thousands of people for a march through the city to shine the spotlight on the climate crisis with the UN Chief stressing that there is no ‘Plan B’ to halt advance of climate change as there is no ‘Planet B.’
About 400,000 people participated in one of the largest global calls for climate action at the People’s Climate March here yesterday that also saw participation by NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, former US Vice President Al Gore, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, US Senator Chuck Schumer and musician Sting.

Speaking to journalists after walking in the rally, Ban said the world needs to “galvanize our action” and harness the people’s “power to change.”
He said the international community should adopt measures to halt the advance of global climate change as there is no “Plan B” for action as there is no “Planet B.”
The rally, which came just two days before Climate Summit at the UN Headquarters, saw politicians, celebrities, activists and the general public march though the city to highlight global concerns about a lack of international action to stop the deleterious effects of climate change.
The summit is expected to draw more than 120 heads of State and Government to galvanize action on climate change.
The People’s Climate March is part of a worldwide campaign to persuade global leaders to act decisively on the issue.
Similar climate events were reported in 2,000 locations around the world.
The march is campaigning, among other issues for curbs on harmful carbon emissions which contribute to global warming.
At last count, 2,129,060 people around the world had also signed a petition calling for world leaders to take bold action at the UN Climate Summit on September 23. The petition was handed over to the UN chief on the march route.
Chanting slogans and playing music, marchers created a noisy carnival atmosphere as they filed through Manhattan.

Nifty below 8 100; HDFC Group shares slipNifty below 8,100; HDFC Group shares slip
SI Reporter | Mumbai Sep 22, 2014 11:47 AM IST
Benchmark shares indices continued to trade weak in late morning trades with HDFC Group and IT shares leading the decline.
The weak showing is primarily reflecting the caution in Asian markets as investors apprehend evidence of further contraction in Chinese manufacturing to emerge, particularly if the flash manufacturing PMI data to be released on Tuesday is seen treading below 50 mark.
At 11.40AM, the 30-share Sensex is down 105.52 points at 26,984.90 and the 50-share Nifty has shed 41.20 points at 8,080.25.
Both BSE Mid cap and Small Cap outperformed the Sensex with a gain of 0.19%  and a gain of 0.53% respectively.
Market breadth is positive with 1378 advances against 1061 declines.

Meet Google Glass competitor Ora at$300French company wants to challenge Google Glass with price. Optinvent has priced the consumer version of Ora at $300, but claims it is better.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:46 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 7:27 pm
Finally, some hope for those who won’t be able to afford a Google Glass. A French company has unveiled a cheaper, and what it calls better, option to Google’s popular on-the-nose device. Optinvent has two versions of its dual-mode  smart glass. One a developer version called ORA-1 priced at $599 and the other a consumer version named ORA-X at $300. That makes the price a fifth of that of the $1500 Google Glass.
Ora X features a front-facing 1080p 5MP camera, a 9-axis motion sensor, wireless connectivity with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS as well as a trackpad for tactile interactions with the device. The company claims the eyewear, powered by a dual-core chip, can support complex applications can well and even has an augmented reality mode.
What really sets the Ora apart from the Google Glass is its second Flip-Vu mode, where you change the angle of the prism, to view get augmented reality with images in the field of vision and a glance mode where you look down at the image. Otherwise it is a bit thicker than the Glass on the sides.
“We don’t necessarily consider ourselves a head-on Google Glass competitor. We were around long before Glass. We started working on the core technology for smart glasses in 2008 and feel the ORA has a different value proposition,” said Optinvent’s CEO Kayvan Mirza in an email interview. He said that while Google Glass’s capabilities are similar to that of a smart watch, ORA is more like a full blown tablet. “The ORA can run AR applications, the display is three times the size of Glass, and can be positioned in two modes,” Mirza said, explaining why he feels the ORA will deliver a more compelling user experience. He claimed Ora does not suffer from issues like color rendering, low brightness and small field of view that plague other smart glasses and is also more scalable.
But what might prove to be the biggest selling point for Ora, however, is the price. The developer version is selling at $600, less that half the price of the Glass. “Yes, we are a start-up so we don’t have the same purchasing power as these giants. But we are still able to offer our product at a third of the price.  It gets even better; our consumer product has been announced for $300. That is because our core technology is by far the most cost effective to produce in volume,” said Mirza, who thinks the price has to become aggressive for these devices to become mainstream.
Incidentally, at IFA in Berlin Sony showcased its new smart Glass, which is a far cry from what continued…

ISRO s MOM enters Gravitational Sphere of In...ISRO's MOM enters Martian Gravitational Sphere of Influence
By PTI | 22 Sep, 2014, 01.27PM IST
Now that the spacecraft has entered the Mars' influence, its velocity has to be controlled so that it does not escape the Mars' influence, ISRO said.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
CHENNAI: Cruising towards its historic rendezvous with the red planet, India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) today entered the Mars Gravitational Sphere of Influence ahead of its scheduled Orbit Insertion on September 24.
"Our navigators' calculations show that MOM has entered the Gravitational Sphere of Influence of Mars," ISRO said on its social networking site, adding, the spacecraft was within 5.4 lakh km radius of the Mars' Gravitational Sphere of Influence.
After being launched from ISRO's spaceport of Sriharikota on November 5 last year, the MOM had left Earth's orbit on December 1 and began its historic voyage to put India on the list of elite nations, which has sent a mission to Mars.
"MOM has entered the Mars Gravitational Sphere of Influence this morning and we will perform certain procedures on the mission today. The fourth trajectory correction manoeuvre and test firing of Main Liquid Engine will be test fired for 3.968 seconds," an ISRO official told PTI.
Now that the spacecraft has entered the Mars' influence, its velocity has to be controlled so that it does not escape the Mars' influence, he said, adding, the spacecraft is scheduled to enter the Mars Orbit Insertion at 7.30 AM IST on September 24.
The crucial fourth trajectory correction manoeuvre and test fire of the main liquid engine on the spacecraft is scheduled for 2.30 PM today.
The MOM, India's first interplanetary mission, was launched by India's workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle from the spaceport of Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.

Growth in China s factory sector seen stalling in SeptGrowth in China's factory sector seen stalling in Sept
Reuters
Tweet
BEIJING, Sept 22:  
Growth in China's large factory sector probably stalled in September, adding to worries the economy could be at risk of a sharper slowdown unless Beijing rolls out more stimulus measures, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.
The flash HSBC/Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) likely straddled the boom-bust line of 50 in September, the median forecast of 19 economists showed, dipping from August's final PMI reading of 50.2, a three-month low.
The first indicator to preview how the world's second-largest economy has fared each month, the flash PMI is closely watched by investors, especially at a time when concerns about the Chinese economy are growing.
"There's still a lot of downward pressure on the economy, especially from the property sector," said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics.
China's economy has stumbled this year as a slowdown in the housing market further weighed on softening domestic demand.
Worries that China was slipping into a deeper downturn were heightened this month when data showed factory output grew at the weakest pace in nearly six years in August as growth in other key sectors also cooled.
The run of weak data, including a measure for the amount of credit in China that crumbled to a six-year low in July, has fed speculation that the authorities may further loosen fiscal and monetary policies to stoke growth.
But Chinese leaders have publicly ruled out the option. Premier Li Keqiang said earlier this month that China cannot rely on easy credit to fuel its economic growth, and said the country would only tweak policy in certain areas to aid activity.
Finance Minister Lou Jiwei also said over the weekend that China would not dramatically alter its economic policies because of fluctuations in any one economic indicator.
China is scheduled to release its official PMI on Oct. 1. A reading over 50 for PMI indicates growth on a monthly basis, while an outcome below 50 points to a contraction.

Anomaly in Indian Ocean warming could affect future monsoon pattern'Anomaly in Indian Ocean warming could affect future monsoon pattern'
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Sept 22:  
Researchers have found evidence of a major anomaly in the warming of the Indian Ocean, which could alter the strength of the southwest monsoon.
It could also adversely impact the marine food-webs over one of the most biologically productive regions, says Roxy Mathew Koll, lead researcher and co-author of a paper on the subject.
WARMEST OCEAN
“The results of our study challenge our current understanding of Indian Ocean warming and climate change,” Koll told BusinessLine.
Koll is associated with the Centre for Climate Change Research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. The co-authors are Ritika Kapoor, Terray Pascal, and Masson Sebastien.
Titled ‘The curious case of Indian Ocean warming,’ the paper is scheduled to appear in the Journal of Climate, published by the American Meteorological Society.
Being the warmest among the major oceans, the Indian Ocean plays a critical role in regulating the monsoon as well as the dynamics over the tropics.
During summer, the central-east Indian Ocean hosts a ‘warm pool’ of waters with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) greater than 28 deg Celsius.
ENHANCED CONVECTION
This makes it highly conducive for enhanced convection, which involves the process of building rain-bearing clouds.
Studies on trends during the past half century have pointed out substantial warming over this warm pool, though the reasons have remained ambiguous.
But an analysis of the warming during 1901-2012 by Koll and team has revealed a different picture of Indian Ocean warming.
“The focus now shifts to the relatively cool western Indian Ocean,” Koll says.
“We find that the western tropical Indian Ocean has been warming for more than a century at a rate faster than any other region of the tropical oceans, and has attained the warm pool SST values of 28 deg Celsius.”
While the warm pool (in the east) went through a warming of 0.7 deg Celsius, the western basin experienced an anomalous increase of 1.2 deg Celsius in summer.
GRADIENTS WEAKEN
Thus, the warming of the generally cool western Indian Ocean against the warm pool region (in the east) weakens the SST gradients.
This has the potential to change the monsoon circulation and rainfall, as well as alter the marine food webs in this biologically productive region.
This is because warming causes the air over the ocean to expand and lower the atmospheric pressure. It unsettles the wind pattern which, in turn, decides the monsoon flows.
Analysing the causes, the research said the warming trend over the Indian Ocean is highly dependent on what happens in the equatorial Pacific.
The El Nino induces anomalous warming over the western Indian Ocean; but its alter ego La Nina fails to do the inverse.
A second, prominent reason is that the frequency of El Nino events has increased in recent decades.
EL NINO IMPACT
In an El Nino, the Pacific Ocean appears to throws out its heat, which partially gets accumulated in the Indian Ocean.
Post-1950, a few warm events over the Indian Ocean have attained the threshold value for El Nino (anomalies greater than 0.77 deg Celsius).
This places these warm events almost on a par with the El Nino in magnitude, Koll says.
In this manner, the Indian Ocean warming turns out to be the largest contributor in phase, with the overall trend in the global SST.
Over the long term, the warming scenario and related climate dynamics are factors to be vigilant of, while assessing climate change and variability.

Crude oil futures decline to Rs 5 582 per barrelCrude oil futures decline to Rs 5,582 per barrel
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 22:  
Crude oil futures fell 0.52 per cent to Rs 5,582 per barrel today as speculators trimmed positions amid a weak trend in Asian trade.
On the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for delivery in October fell Rs 29 or 0.52 per cent to Rs 5,582 per barrel in 514 lots.
Besides, the oil for November delivery moved down by Rs 20 or 0.36 per cent to Rs 5,592 per barrel in 18 lots.
Analysts said the decline in crude oil prices at the futures trade was primarily after it fell in the Asian trade ahead of key Chinese manufacturing data for clues about demand in the world’s top energy consumer.
Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery eased 31 cents to $92.10, while Brent crude for November was down 44 cents at $97.95 a barrel in late-morning trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Google selects HTC for upcoming Nexus tabletGoogle selects HTC for upcoming Nexus tablet
Reuters
Reuters
Sept 22:  
Google Inc has selected HTC Corp to make its upcoming 9-inch Nexus tablet, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Google had been mulling HTC as a potential Nexus tablet partner since last year and HTC engineers have been flying to the Googleplex in Mountain View in recent months to work on the project, the report said. (http://on.wsj.com/1qYQrAU)
Google's decision to pick HTC reflects its long-term strategy of building a broad base of partners from device to device to prevent any one manufacturer from gaining a monopoly, the report said.
That may also be one of the reasons why Google chose HTC over bigger rivals Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, maker of the Nexus 10 tablet.
Representatives at Google were not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. HTC declined to comment on the report.

Putting revenue before resources is wrongPutting revenue before resources is wrong
P ELANGO
We need a structure that will attract risk investment and help to step up oil exploration activities significantly.
September 22, 2014:  
The Centre is moving towards a revenue-sharing system for oil exploration contracts from the time-tested policy of production sharing. It released a draft model Revenue Sharing Contract (RSC) recently seeking public comment. The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) regime was the basis of the nine NELP (New Exploration Licensing Policy) bid rounds over the last two decades. These rounds resulted in over 250 PSCs, attracted investments worth over $20 billion and led to 130 discoveries with three of them being categorised as major.
Over a period, the PSC system attracted controversy becoming a challenge to both contractors and the Government. Purposeless procedures took precedence and the primary purpose of finding and producing oil and gas was lost. It is unfortunate that faulty contract management has now led to changing a sound policy.
PSC versus RSC
The key difference between the PSC and RSC is that the PSC model would encourage investors to take higher exploration risks, and in the event of success, the costs could be recovered. Since only one-third of our sedimentary basins have been fully explored, a contract model that encourages intensified exploration activities should have been preferred.
India remains one of the least explored countries and could hold large potential resources. For example, 15 basins out of a total 26 sedimentary basins in India spread over on-land, offshore and deepwater, are estimated to hold prognosticated hydrocarbon resources of over 200 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Out of these, hydrocarbon-in-place volume of 80 billion barrels has been established through exploration activities by the public sector and private oil and gas companies. There is still a significant ‘yet to find’ hydrocarbon resources of over 120 billion barrels. Therefore, significant increase in exploration efforts is critical and this requires the urgent attention of the new government.
Interestingly, two very eminent economists — C. Rangarajan and Kelkar — leading two different panels, had different ideas of contract models. Dr. Rangarajan preferred the revenue sharing model as “it would overcome the difficulties in managing the existing model based on the pre-tax investment multiple (PTIM) methodology and the cost-recovery mechanism.”
And Dr. Kelkar was of the view that “The Indian PSC is designed to encourage E&P [exploration and production] activity in the interest of enhancing national energy security. The committee analysis shows that under PSC, the interests of the government are aligned with the interests of the contractors. Under the PSC, as the investor returns improve, the government take also increases as it is designed to allow the government to retain a fair share of the upside.”
Faults of the RSC
Now that a final decision seems to have been taken by the government in favour of the revenue sharing model, one expected a simple, easy to manage contract structure. However, the draft model revenue sharing contract disappoints.
It introduces the concept of escrow account in a contract which is meant to attract risk capital to first find resources before the revenue could be shared. An escrow account, by definition, is a temporary pass-through account.
Revenue in oil exploration comes post-development of a commercial discovery and these are not temporary transactions. Typical contract terms are for over 25 years. Such contracts are essentially endeavours in partnership. While the resources belong to the government, it needs oil and gas companies with technical capabilities and balance-sheet strength to make risk investments.
The draft contract expects investing companies to receive all revenues only under an escrow account so that the government could protect its share of revenue, and in certain circumstances, restrict the contractors’ access to the account. The spirit of partnership and trust is completely missing.
The other striking feature is that there is a wrong assumption of certainty about discovery-to-delivery periods and more importantly, about oil and gas production profiles. Under the draft provisions in the model contract, the contractor is expected to commit to a production profile and is liable to pay penalties if the actual production varies from the forecast by 25 per cent.
Nothing in oil and gas business is certain. The data from seismic surveys using the best of technology cannot tell with certainty whether the fluid seen is oil or water. One needs to drill a well to find out. And drilling a well could cost over Rs.20 crore if it’s a simple, shallow, onshore well to over Rs.500 crore if it’s a complex deep water well.
Finding oil and or gas is not certain to make it commercial as it has to be in right quantity and at the right price. In India, strangely very simple procedural deviations can make a discovery an illegitimate one! How much oil and gas one will end up producing is again uncertain as it is dependent upon multiple technical factors. One knows the precise answer only when the last barrel is produced from a field. To put such penal provisions is a sure way to put off serious investors who have multiple investment options across the globe.
Considering that only one-third of our sedimentary basins are fully explored, only 15 per cent of basins have been covered by 3D seismic surveys and only 15,000 wells have been drilled over 60 years (there are one million wells in production in the U.S.) what we need is a contract structure that will attract risk investment and help to step up exploration activities significantly.
This is the only way we can catch up on the lost decades.
To my mind the priority steps are:
(1) Build the National Geo Data Repository and launch Open Acreage Licence Policy — This allows prospective bidders to look at the data any time and offer a bid to explore in the most transparent manner;
(2) provide market-determined oil price to ONGC and Oil India to bring marginal oil fields into production and to implement enhanced oil recovery techniques to recover more from matured oil fields;
(3) resolve the current uncertainty over gas price promptly;
(4) remove the artificial distinction between oil and gas for the purpose of tax holidays — both these are commodities of hydrocarbon molecules and can easily substitute each other and exploration risks and efforts required to find them are same, and
(5) announce the PSC extension policy to remove uncertainty over the production sharing contracts of few producing fields coming up for extension.
Launching NELP X with a revenue sharing contract model without clarity on the above five areas will be akin to putting the cart before the horse. The current draft model of revenue sharing contract needs to be revised to bring the focus back on finding resources first and the government share of the revenues needs to be collected in the same way that it collects income tax and duties.
India depends on imports to meet 75 per cent of its crude oil requirements spending close to Rs.3,000 crore everyday. If the domestic oil exploration activities are not stepped up, over the next 10 years, we would end up transferring $1.5 trillion of our wealth (that’s the current size of our economy) to oil exporting countries.
On the contrary, the countries which were able to attract investment and technology ended up finding more oil and gas resources. The most recent and fascinating examples are the discovery of super giant field in Mozambique and in Phoenix South prospect in Australia, where oil has been discovered in a place close to an initial discovery made 34 years earlier. What it tells you is that exploration is a never-ending game where perseverance and passion surely pays and the ever-advancing discovery and recovery technologies aid immensely. All that the government needs to do is to put in place enabling policies that encourage exploration endeavours for ever.

Railgate: Ex-Railway Minister Pawan Kuma Bansal appears aswitnessPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:53 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 2:47 pm
Bansal, who resigned in May last year as Railway Minister after the matter came to light, was named as a prosecution witness in the case.
Former Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal Monday appeared in a Delhi court to depose as a prosecution witness in the Rs 10 crore cash-for-post railway bribery case in which his nephew is also an accused.
Prior to recording his statement Special CBI Judge Swarana Kanta Sharma asked media persons present there to vacate the court room during the proceedings.
Bansal had appeared pursuant to the court’s fresh summons issued on September 16, when it had made it clear that no exemption from personal appearance would be given to him on the next date.
On the last date of hearing, Bansal had sought exemption on medical grounds.
Bansal was summoned as a prosecution witness in the case in which his nephew Vijay Singla, suspended Railway Board member Mahesh Kumar and eight others are facing trial.
He had not appeared before the court on the last date of hearing and his counsel Puneet Ahluwalia had told the judge that the Congress leader was unwell as he was suffering from viral fever and he would appear on any date after September 19.
Bansal, who resigned in May last year as Railway Minister after the matter came to light, was named as a prosecution witness in the case.
The court had commenced the trial in the case on September 15 in which CBI had charge sheeted 10 accused last year.
The court had on March 11 this year framed charges against all the accused under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC read with provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act.
The court had framed charges against Singla, then Member (Staff) of Railway Board Mahesh Kumar, Managing Director of Bangalore-based G G Tronics India Pvt Limited N R Manjunath, alleged middlemen Ajay Garg and Sandeep Goyal and co-accused Rahul Yadav, Sameer Sandhir, Sushil Daga, C V Venugopal and M V Murali Krishan.
CBI had alleged that Singla had demanded Rs 10 crore from Kumar for his appointment as Member (Electrical) and it was decided between the accused that Rs 5 crore will be paid before the appointment and the rest after the job was done.
It had claimed first tranche of around Rs 90 lakh was given to Singla who was apprehended while accepting the money.

Pakistan appoints army chief's ally Rizwan Akhtar as ISI chief

(Pakistan has appointed…)
ISLAMABAD: Lt Gen Rizwan Akhtar, a close confidante of Pakistan's powerful Army Chief, was today named as the new head of the controversial spy agency ISI, enhancing the military's clout over the embattled government facing protests.
Lt Gen Akhtar was promoted as a three-star general and appointed Director General Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as part of a major reshuffle in the military, a development that would help Army Chief Gen Raheel Sharif in consolidating his powers amid political instability in the country.
"Maj Gens Rizwan Akhtar, Hilal Hussain, Ghayur Mahmood, Nazir Butt, Navid Mukhtar, Hidayat Ur Rehman" were promoted to next ranks, Director General Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major Asim Bajwa tweeted.
Akhtar was appointed as DGISI, Hidayat was posted to Peshawar Corps, Mukhtar to Karachi Corps, Hussain to Mangla Corps, Mahmood to Gujranwala Coprs and Butt was made chief of communication and Information Technology at the Headquarters.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif gave his approval to these postings on the recommendations of General Sharif.
Lt Gen Akhtar will take over from October 1 when the current ISI chief Lt Gen Zaheerul Islam retires along with four other Lieutenant Generals.
Those retiring are Mangla corps commander Lt Gen Tariq Khan, Gujranwala corps commander Lt Gen Saleem Nawaz, Peshawar corps commander Lt Gen Khalid Rabbani and Karachi corps commander Lt Gen Sajjad Ghani.
Technically and legally the ISI chief is appointed by the Prime Minister on the advice of the Army Chief but the former can seldom have his will. Usually the Army Chief sends a name as a formality to the Prime Minister, who has to approve it.
Earlier, it was reported that Maj Gen Naveed Mukhtar was also in the running for the top spy job.
Akhtar is a graduate of the Command and Staff College in Quetta, National Defense University and the Army War College, USA, Dawn News reported.
He is from the Frontier Force Regiment and commanded the infantry brigade and infantry division in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).
Previously as Sindh DG Rangers, Maj Gen Akhtar had been assigned with the task to lead the Karachi operation.
As head of the paramilitary Rangers force in Karachi he launched a major operation against criminal gangs and Taliban militants.
But the military had later replaced him as DG Rangers Sindh with another senior military officer.
Akhtar is also considered to have extensive experience of counter-insurgency from a previous posting in the border region of South Waziristan.
"He has served in a place like Karachi while remaining neutral and apolitical and has extensive experience of counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism. He was the obvious choice," said a serving military official.
"He is a professional soldier who has experience of both FATA and internal security in Karachi," an army official said.
The appointments are expected to help the army consolidate its position amid political turmoil that has weakened Sharif's position.
  Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan and fiery cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri of the Pakistan Awami Tehreek have been protesting against the Nawaz Sharif-led government since August 14, demanding the Prime Minister's ouster.
Khan wants Sharif's resignation over alleged rigging in last year's poll which his party lost, while Qadri wants to bring a revolution in the country.
The appointment comes at a time when army has been accused of instigating unrest in order to weaken Sharif.
Although Pakistan saw its first democratic civilian transfer of power last year, the country has been ruled by the army for much of its history.
The ISI was established in 1948 and became the primary institution running the intelligence operations of the army, air force and navy.
Analysts say that although its precise machinations have remained shadowy, there is little doubt it has played a major role in Pakistan's volatile politics.

Buy USDINR above 61.00; target of 61.20: Way2Wealth
Way2Wealth has come out with its report on currencies. According to the research firm, one can buy USDINR above 61.00 for target of 61.20 with a stop loss of 60.87
Post your opinion here
Way2Wealth's report on currencies
USDINR (60.91)
The domestic rupee remained under a bit pressure in Friday’s session due to marginal profit booking in stock markets. As a result, the pair recovered some of its losses and closed flat. On the daily chart, the pair found support near the previous swing low of 60.85 on closing basis. Thus, only a break of 60.80 will lead to further weakness in the pair. On the upside, 61.10 – 61.20 levels are likely to act as resistance in the coming session.
GBPINR (99.74)
The double top pattern was not activated in Friday’s session since GBPINR started the day with an upside gap way above 100 mark. However, selling pressure forced the pair to close near day’s low. Thus the view remains same that in case of breach of 99.39 level the pair can drift towards 98.50 level in the coming session. On the upside, 100.30 – 101 will remain as sturdy resistance for the coming sessions.
EURINR (78.38)
Although EURINR closed negative in Friday’s session, the move was not big enough to break the support of 78.03. Thus, once gain the mentioned level is likely to remain crucial support for the coming session. A breach of this level might trigger further pessimism in the pair. On the contrary, selloff could be capped once the pair manages to sustain above the Friday’s high of 78.74

Sensex sheds 102 points on profit-taking ahead of September month F&O expirySensex up 116 points; consumer durables, FMCG stocks steal the show
Our Bureau/Agencies
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the green amid weak European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex rose 116.32 points or 0.43 per cent at 27,206.74 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty gained 24.85 points or 0.31 per cent at 8,146.30.
Rajesh Agarwal, Head-Research, Eastern Financiers, in a report said: "Going forward, the Sensex earnings multiple at 17 times FY15 earnings looks a bit stretched, and investors would be better off being cautious as the near term upside looks a little difficult. Some reforms have taken place but the quantum of impact on the bottom-line of corporates needs to be seen. Hot money, lower crude prices, monsoon not turning out to be as bad as was earlier expected, are some of the factors that are driving the markets. While we believe that markets could witness correction in short-term, earnings expansion, government initiatives towards infrastructure and strengthening economic data, provide comfort on the medium-term. We strongly believe that the Government’s pro-growth approach will aid the revival in the economy and would in turn boost equity markets."
Among BSE sectoral indices, consumer durables, FMCG, auto and oil & gas indices were the star-performers and were up 3.12 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.88 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, metal index fell the most by 1.22 per cent, followed by healthcare 0.89 per cent and India infrastructure 0.87 per cent.
Tata Motors, ONGC, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and SBIN were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Cipla, BHEL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Infosys.
Concerns over a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday, while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners' shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 per cent, also took its toll.
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the weekend said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 347.48 at 10:02 a.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.6 per cent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts slid 0.5 per cent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.8 per cent.

Pre-market: Fatigue factor likely to kick inTrade cautiously as markets expected to be volatile
Arun Kejriwal     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 10:29 IST

Arun Kejriwal
Markets are tired. The super Monday, which saw a rally of more than one per cent, saved the blushes for the market and saw it close with the slimmest of gains for the week. The real stars were the midcap and small cap stocks , which seem to have become the darling of bourses. These are dangerous indications and we seem all poised to consolidate and give up the strong position that we are in for the time being.
Markets will take cues from the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy review and wholesale price index-based inflation (WPI) data due this week. On Monday, stocks will react to tepid factory growth and lower retail inflation figures released after markets closed on Friday. WPI-based inflation for August is expected to be released on Monday. Trend in investment by overseas investors, movement of rupee against the dollar and crude oil price would continue to dictate trading in the stock market for the week. Global markets will track the US Fed's two-day meeting ending on Wednesday. J uly's index of industrial production saw a contraction slipping to 0.5 per cent against 3.9 per cent in the previous month. On the other hand, retail, or consumer price index-based, inflation for August fell further to 7.80 per cent against 7.96 per cent in the previous month. This augurs well.
The listing of Snowman Logistics was a super hit with the share gaining a stupendous 69.7 per cent to close at Rs79.75 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Shares were issued at Rs47 and the issue was oversubscribed 60 times. There is likely to be further action as institutional investor Reliance Mutual fund and a high net worth individual bought about 60 lakh shares on the first day. This is against an issue size of 3.25 crore shares and total delivery of 104 lakhs on day one.
This week sees Shemaroo Entertainment Limited trying to raising Rs120 crore in a price band of Rs155-Rs170 with a 10 per cent discount to retail investors. The issue appears to be piggyback riding the goodwill generated by the previous two issues-Snowman Logistics and Sharda Cropchem. The issue on a fully diluted post issue is valued between 15.68 times and 16.76 times on March 14 earnings, which is not cheap by any standards.
This is a working capital intensive company with receivables a huge concern. The company has debtors for the year ended March 14 of Rs140 crore against revenue of Rs264 crore. I would recommend that investors stay away from this issue and not get carried away by the discount.
The Cabinet has cleared three issues for divestment in the form of Sail, Coal India and ONGC. What would be the order of these divestments is not known but they could begin as early as next week itself as they would be through the offer-for-sale route and the stock exchange mechanism. Changes have been made in the way these shares will be sold since the last divestment. There is a retail bucket of 20 per cent reserved for investors who apply for a sum not exceeding Rs2 lakh and there would also be a discount to this category. The idea of these changes is to bring the retail investor back to markets.
Foreign institutional buyers bought equity worth Rs 2,550 crore last week while domestic institutions were sellers worth Rs 593 crore. The week ahead is likely to be choppy and much more volatile than the previous week. The fatigue factor is likely to kick in and we should see consolidation. Trade cautiously.

Alibaba: China s Giant Online Shopping  CrocodileRBL Bank Plans to Launch IPO in Three Quarters
Shanghai: Alibaba has become by far the dominant e-commerce company in China, a country with the world's greatest number of Internet users, in only 15 years.
The Hangzhou-based company is largely unknown outside Greater China, but a historic listing on the New York Stock Exchange Friday and its recently-launched US shopping website, 11 Main, are expanding its global stature. (Also Read: Alibaba Shares Close Up 38% on Opening Day )
By raising $25.02 billion, Chinese online giant Alibaba has broken the record for the largest initial public offering in history. (Read: Largest IPOs in Stock Market History )
With ambitions beyond online retailing, the company is guided by Jack Ma, a diminutive yet charismatic onetime English teacher who is now a billionaire entrepreneur. (Read: Alibaba's Jack Ma Rides 'Forrest Gump' Story to Riches )
"Fifteen years ago, Alibaba's 18 founders were determined to set up a global Internet company originated by Chinese people, with hopes it would become one of the world's top 10 Internet companies, a company which will exist for 102 years," Mr Ma said in May, meaning the company would span three different centuries.
"We have a dream," said Mr Ma, who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday before trading opened. ( With Alibaba's Big Debut, 10 Things to Know )
"We hope in the next 15 years the world will change. We want to be bigger than Wal-Mart."
Alibaba had originally planned to list in Hong Kong, thereby staying on Chinese soil, but talks between the company and the exchange broke down last year because listing rules prevented Ma and top management from retaining control over the board of directors.
The controversial structure has proved to be an issue even with a US listing, prompting Alibaba to disclose the identities of more than 20 partners who have the power to appoint a majority of the corporate board.
"Unlike dual-class ownership structures that employ a high-vote class of shares to concentrate control in a few founders, our approach is designed to embody the vision of a large group of management partners," it argued in a filing with US regulators.
Ma chose the name Alibaba from "1,001 Nights" because it is easily pronounced in both Chinese and English, and the literary work's "open sesame" catchphrase signifies the company can "open a doorway to fortune for small businesses".
'Taobao Girls'
Alibaba is often described as the Chinese version of eBay. Like the US company, it has its own payments system, though it puts less emphasis on online auctions in favour of instant transactions.
Alibaba bested eBay in China over a decade ago, essentially forcing it to retreat.
"eBay may be a shark in the ocean, but I'm a crocodile in the Yangtze River. If we fight in the ocean, we lose, but if we fight in the river, we win," Mr Ma is famously quoted as saying.
Unlike another US online retailing giant, Amazon, Alibaba has no product stocks itself, instead connecting buyers and sellers.
Its consumer-to-consumer platform, Taobao, is estimated to hold more than 90 per cent of the Chinese market with over 800 million product listings and around 500 million registered users.
Taobao's presence is so pervasive in a country with more than half a billion Internet users that it has entered the lexicon: "Taobao Villages" are settlements of sellers while "Taobao Girls" are young women who model clothes on the site.
Another Alibaba platform, Tmall.com, is estimated to hold over half the market in China for business-to-consumer transactions.
Domestic competitors include JD.com, which listed on the US Nasdaq market in May, and a newly created upstart backed by property conglomerate Wanda Group -- the company of Wang Jianlin, who is worth $16 billion, according to publisher Forbes.
The surge in Alibaba's share price following its debut Friday lifted Ma's personal net worth to about $17 billion, making him the new richest man in China, Forbes said.
Ahead of the flotation, Alibaba has embarked on an acquisition frenzy aimed at expanding beyond its traditional online commerce business, though critics say it is already spending the money it will raise.
Recent deals include buying a 50 per cent stake in China's top football club Guangzhou Evergrande, purchasing domestic mobile browser developer UCWeb and paying $1.22 billion for a stake in top Chinese online video platform Youku Tudou.
Alibaba said it recorded profits of nearly $2 billion on revenue of $2.5 billion for the quarter ending June 30.

Hyundai Directors Kept in Dark on Size of $10 Billion Land BidYou are here: Home Corporates
Hyundai Directors Kept in Dark on Size of $10 Billion Land Bid
Reuters | Updated On: September 20, 2014 15:12 (IST)
Sebi Bars Transgene Chief, 5 Officials From Capital Markets
Seoul: Hyundai Motor and two listed affiliates did not seek board clearance for the size of their record $10 billion bid for a plot of land in Seoul, more than triple its appraised value, four board members of the companies told Reuters.
Thursday's winning bid for the land sent shares in Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and Hyundai Mobis plunging, wiping out $8 billion in shareholder value, and sparked howls of protest from investors, rekindling worries about corporate governance at South Korea's conglomerates, or chaebol.
While boards of the three firms discussed and approved bidding for the plot in the capital's high-end Gangnam district to house a headquarters complex, hotel and automotive theme park, the bid price was not shared with directors as it was deemed to be confidential, three of the directors said.
The Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors boards unanimously approved making a bid for the KEPCO land, two directors said.
"The price was top secret, so it was not something we discussed at the meeting," said one, declining to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. "The intangible benefits go beyond the appraisal price of the land."
Another director at one of the companies said its board heard and discussed information about the appraisal price of the KEPCO land and the value of nearby buildings. "Hyundai has many grand ideas around the KEPCO land," he said. "I think it's worth it."
Hyundai Motor Group, headed by 76-year-old Chung Mong-koo, declined to comment on board level decision-making behind its bid, and also said it had not yet decided how the purchase price would be divided among the three companies.
"The one very core element was missing, then, during the process," said Park Yoo-kyung, a Hong Kong-based director specialising in corporate governance at Netherlands-based APG Asset Management, which manages $482 billion in pension assets and holds shares in the three Hyundai firms in the bid group.
Noting that Hyundai's statement after the bid was announced on Thursday did not mention shareholder benefits or value-creation, Park said: "That's an amazing thing. It's unbelievably negative. We are very angry."
In sealed bidding, Hyundai Motor Group won the auction by a "a wide margin", said an official with the seller, state-run Korea Electric Power (KEPCO). The other bidder, Samsung Electronics, has not said how much it bid, but media reports put it in the $4-$5 billion range.
Urge to Splurge
Hyundai Motor Group, the world's fifth-largest automaker, had long made clear it coveted the 79,342 square metre site, the last big piece of land available for development in the capital's prestigious southern Gangnam district.
Even before its bid, it had spoken of plans to build a landmark complex on the plot, so it had been widely expected to offer a hefty price, but its actual bid far surpassed expectations. Nomura estimated the total investment associated with land, tax, and building could reach 20 trillion won ($19.17 billion).
Hyundai, whose corporate forebears were instrumental in South Korea's breakneck industrialisation decades ago, invoked national pride in its plans for the site.
"This (global business center) will raise the brand value of the automobile industry and the country, and contribute to revitalizing the national economy by actively attracting foreigners and tourists," it said on Thursday.
Unconvinced
Kim Sang-jo, executive director of Solidarity for Economic Reform, an advocacy organisation for better corporate governance, said his group would ask the companies for minutes of their board meetings to try to determine whether there was adequate discussion.
"Hyundai made a nonsensical, reckless decision because they did not take into account shareholders," Kim said.
South Korea implemented reforms in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 to improve the performance of corporate boards, including introducing outside directors. However, worries about corporate governance in the big family-controlled groups that dominate corporate Korea continue to weigh on market valuations.
Hyundai Motor group has plenty of cash, but many investors were hoping instead for bigger dividend payouts, as well as investment in production capacity and research and development in a competitive market chasing better fuel economy and "greener" models.
A Hyundai Motor spokesman said in an email to Reuters on Friday: "There are always meetings with investors, and we are ready to fully answer questions from investors regarding this matter. We would like to say that there has been a need to construct an integrated company building for a long time."

Apple Faithful Line Up for Latest  Larger iPhonesYou are here: Home Corporates
Apple Faithful Line Up for Latest, Larger iPhones
Reuters | Updated On: September 20, 2014 17:23 (IST)
Sebi Bars Transgene Chief, 5 Officials From Capital Markets
New York/San Francisco: Apple Inc's latest phone lured throngs of gadget lovers, entrepreneurs and early adopters to its stores in New York, San Francisco and other cities around the world in the latest sign of strong initial demand for the new, larger generation of iPhones.
Even the night before the phones' Friday debut, nearly 70 people were waiting in line in front of the Apple store in downtown San Francisco. Some eager to get their hands on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which feature larger screens and longer battery life, had been there since the night before.
At the Apple store on Fifth Avenue in New York, the line of would-be buyers stretched for more than 10 blocks. Apple employees led them in a New Year's Eve-style countdown to herald the store's opening at 8 a.m. (1200 GMT) and high-fived customers as they entered the glass cube leading to the underground store.
In Atlanta, police were called in before 5:30 a.m. to assist with crowd control at one mall location because of worries about trampling, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
While it has become customary for swarms of people to greet Apple product introductions, Friday's long lines were still a sign of healthy demand for the new models. The phones drew more than 4 million preorder requests in the first 24 hours on September 12, more than double the 2 million for iPhone 5s in the same period two years ago.
The enthusiastic crowds gathered despite signs that Apple's legendary "cool factor" may be dimming with some consumers, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll.
Sales predictions from investors tend to be optimistic. Apple watchers tracking the early sales of the new iPhones note that the precise number of units sold in the first weekend will depend on the strength of the supply chain. A Friday report from Barclays cited the long lines outside stores as a positive sign for demand, suggesting that combined first-weekend sales for the new phones could rise as high as 11 million units.
Despite the high demand, sales could be choked by a limited number of iPhone 6 Pluses available immediately. A T-Mobile US Inc spokeswoman said Friday that demand for the new phones was "tremendous," but the larger model would not be available yet.
Paul Terrebonne, a 26-year-old cook who had preordered his space-grey iPhone 6, said the size of the new devices had been enough to lure him back to Apple from his previous phone, a Motorola Moto X.
"It's all about screen size, plus I missed the iPhone's camera," he said, adding that he had shunned the iPhone 6 Plus because it was "a bit too big."
The launch attracted buyers from farther afield. Flavio Gondim, a 40-year-old Brazilian public sector employee, said he was buying an iPhone 6 in New York because "back home these are, maybe, 50 percent more expensive."
In Asia, many who lined up to buy the new phones in Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia said they planned to re-sell the devices in China, where regulatory hurdles are holding up the new phones' debut.
It remains to be seen whether the renewed iPhone mania will extend to Apple's other big product introduction, the Apple Watch, which will not be available until early next year.
Raj Kaur, who was comfortably waiting in line in San Francisco in a folding chair, said she did not plan to repeat the vigil for the new watch.
"I'll wait for the second edition," she said, "when they've worked out the kinks."

No Plan to Tie Up With Private Firms for Retail Expansion: Bharat PetroleumSebi Bars Transgene Chief, 5 Officials From Capital Markets
Mumbai: Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), India's third largest oil marketer, has ruled out tying up with private players, saying the PSU has enough capabilities for expanding its retail presence on its own.
Rival Hindustan Petroleum, which is the second largest OMC player, recently said it would be keen to tie up with private players like Reliance Industries (RIL) or Essar for sharing their idle retail infrastructure.
"We have no plans to engage with private players to share their retail infrastructure for marketing as we are hopeful of taking on competition on our own. We don't see any brand synergy in doing so and also we have enough capabilities to invest more in retail expansion," BPCL chairman and managing director S Varadarajan told reporters in Mumbai over the weekend after the AGM.
The chairman said BPCL had opened more than 900 outlets last fiscal year, taking its total retail network to over 12,500, the company will open more outlets. He did not specify a number.
It can be noted that private players like Reliance Industries and Essar Oil with thousands of outlets have shut down marketing following the government refusal to free diesel prices after the 2006 oil spike. But with diesel being sold at market price now, they are likely to re-enter marketing.
HPCL chairman and managing director Nishi Vasudeva had earlier this month said her company would like to tie up with private players for convenience and to save on capital expenditure, but added nothing had been finalised yet.
Currently, oil firms are selling diesel at 35 paise above market rate as the government has not allowed them officially to cut prices. There have been reports that it may formally announce diesel deregulation post-October 15 assembly elections.
Diesel prices have been brought to market levels following the staggered deregulation that began in September 2012. Under this, OMCs were allowed to raise retail prices by 50 paise per month and also due to falling crude prices, which is hovering around $98 a barrel now.
Meanwhile, Mr Varadarajan said BPCL will invest over Rs 12,000 crore over the next four years in the Mozambique and Brazil upstream business. This is nearly double of what the state-run company had spent in exploration and production in the past decade.
The investments will be part of the Rs 45,000-crore capex planned, including expansion of Kochi refinery from 9.5 MT to 15.5 MT at the cost of Rs 16,500 crore, over the next three years.
The Mozambique (gas) and Brazil (oil) fields will start production by FY18 and FY19 respectively, he said, adding that so far no domestic player has contacted the company for gas or oil.
BPCL's exploration subsidiary - Bharat PetroResources (BPRL) - owns oil and gas assets in Brazil, Mozambique, Indonesia and Australia.
In Mozambique, BPCL holds a 10 per cent stake in the gas blocks operated by the US-based Anadarko Petroleum Corp.
Mozambique blocks have around 50-70 trillion cubic feet natural gas, which is nearly 10 times the reserves of RIL's D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin. Out of this BPCL's share is at 5-7 tcf.
Mr Varadarajan also said BPCL will be booking 1-3 million tonnes of LNG annually as part of its plans to improve its gas business through its East and West coasts terminals.
"We are looking at booking capacities in LNG terminals. For our international business, we are looking for long term gas and have signed up two million tonnes import gas pact with foreign players," Mr Varadarajan said.
He further said the company will be laying the country's first cross-country pipeline that will connect to Bangladesh. Its subsidiary Assam-based Numaligarh Refineries will shortly begin work on laying the 170-km pipeline from Siliguri in Bengal to Parbatipur in Bangladesh.
The pipeline will help BPCL penetrate the Bangladeshi market and ensure sustained supply of oil products to Bangladesh.

The Nifty is likely to open lower on Monday as indicated by futures trade on Singapore Stock Exchange and lower Asian markets. Foreign investors have sold stocks worth Rs 7 crore on Friday. However domestic investors were net buyers to the tune of Rs 237 crore. Markets are likely to be volatile this week leading to expiry of derivative contracts on Thursday.
Here are the stocks to track in trade today:
Coal India is reportedly to hike price of coal supplied under long term contracts to mitigate impact of losses the company has to suffer because of reduction in e-auction volume. Coal sold under e-auction generate higher ebitda margin for Coal India. Under another development Coal India has signed a pact with staff unions to pay Rs 40,000 Diwali bonus per employee for FY15. This will entail a total pay-out of over Rs 1,300 crore which is more than the profit the company has generated for the quarter ending June 30, 2014.
Bharti Infratel: Private equity fund Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co (KKR) is reportedly to launch a share sale to exit from its holding in the company. KKR currently owns 2.38 per cent stake in Bharti Infratel. KKR has been invested in Bharti Infratel for last 6 years.
Hotel Leela Venture has sought more time to pay first instalment of Rs 22.50 crore for servicing a debt to Life Insurance Corporation of India. The company has not paid quarterly interest due on June 19 and September 19. The company had a total debt of Rs 5,000 crore as on June 30.
Shree Cements has entered into a business transfer agreement with Jaiprakash Associates to acquire 1.5 -million-tonne grinding unit. The board of Shree Cements has earlier approved this transaction. The transaction is subject to approval of regulators and shareholders.
IDBI Bank has cut interest rate by 21 basis points on 91-269 day bulk deposits on Friday. Now the bank will offer interest rate of 8.5 per cent on bulk deposit of Rs 50-Rs 100 crore.
Punjab National Bank board has approved stock split in the ratio of 5:1. This means each stock having face value of Rs 10 will be divided into five shares of Rs 2 face value.
Just Dial: Credit Suisse has initiated coverage on the stock with neutral for a target price of Rs 1,650 per share. The brokerage says the company is likely to see margin expansion with reasonable growth potential. Currently the stock trades at rich valuation, says Credit Suisse.

Rupee down 4 paise against US dollar  at 60.85Forex update: Rupee falls after four days to 60.82 level

The rupee on Monday closed one paisa down at 60.82 against the US dollar at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market on alternate bouts of demand and supply, snapping a four-day rising trend.
In lacklustre trade, the rupee commenced lower at 60.85 against the American unit from its previous close of 60.81 . It was trapped in a range of 60.7425 and 60.88 before concluding at 60.82, showing a minor fall of one paisa.
In the previous four days, the domestic unit had risen by 32 paise.
The dollar index was down 0.04 per cent against its major global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO, said, "Rupee traded in a thin range and ended flat. Rupee is expected to appreciate in coming days tracking gains in local equities. The trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 60.30 to 61.30."
The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex on Monday washed out  initial sharp losses and gained 116.32 points to end at two-week high.
Foreign  Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought shares worth US $18.48 million  last Friday, as per data released by the Securities and Exchange Board  of India (Sebi).

Jadavpur students protesting ban on alcohol, not molestation, suggests Mamata's nephew

Kolkata: In the backdrop of protests in the Jadavpur student molestation case, TMC leader and West Bengal Chief Mamata Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee has sparked off a row. Posting on his Facebook page, the TMC leader suggested that students are protesting following the ban on liquor and other illegal substances and not the molestation.
This post came even as the West Bengal government has decided to form a panel to look into the matter. On Sunday, the state's Education Minister Partha Chatterjee met the survivor at her residence and has assured her an impartial inquiry. Partha Chatterjee said the inquiry committee was being formed under the directive of Mamata Banerjee.
"Members of the probe panel would be requested to submit report within 72 hours as desired by the CM," he said. Chatterjee said that the committee would be formed by the department of education with three or four members, names of whom would be made public on Monday.

The issue has rocked the university campus with students demanding the Vice Chancellor's resignation. Even though Jadavpur University had formed a probe panel to investigate into the case, students gheraoed the VC, registrar and other members of the executive council on the intervening night of September 16 and September 17 demanding a fresh probe panel to investigate the alleged sexual harassment of the girl inside the campus on August 28.

G20 Says Nearing Growth Goal  but More Needed From EuropeYou are here: Home Economy
G20 Says Nearing Growth Goal, but More Needed From Europe
Reuters | Updated On: September 21, 2014 14:50 (IST)
Commercial Mining of Coal to be Allowed After Auction: Finance Minister
Cairns, Australia: The Group of 20 nations says they are tantalisingly close to adding an extra $2 trillion to the global economy and creating millions of new jobs, but Europe's extended stagnation remains a major stumbling block.
The finance ministers and central bank chiefs gathered in the Australian city of Cairns claimed progress on fireproofing the world's financial system and on closing tax loopholes exploited by giant multinationals.
They also dealt with the thorny problem of whether to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the G20 leaders' summit in November given events in Ukraine, with the consensus being to maintain diplomatic pressure but leave the door open for his attendance.
"We are determined to lift growth, and countries are willing to use all our macroeconomic levers - monetary, fiscal and structural policies - to meet this challenge," said Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey, who hosted the event.
Almost 1,000 measures had been proposed that would boost global growth by 1.8 per cent by 2018, nearing the ambitious goal of 2 percentage points adopted back in February.
A common concern was the risk of Europe's economic malaise pulling others down. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew cited "philosophical" differences with some of his counterparts in Europe, especially on the need for near-term stimulus.
"The concern that I have is that if the efforts to boost demand are deferred for too long, there's a risk that the headwinds get stronger and what Europe needs is some more tailwinds in the economy," Mr Lew said.
That was not an argument that found favour with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble who emphasised the need for structural reforms and strict budget controls.
The proposals to lift global growth will now go for formal approval at the summit of G20 leaders in Brisbane in November.
Chief among them was a global initiative aimed at increasing private investment in infrastructure, a particular hobby horse of the Australians who head the G20 this year.
China gets a pass
While Europe's failings were front and centre, there was surprisingly little said about China's slowdown, at least publicly. That struck some as odd given the Asian giant was just behind the United States in the size of its economy.
"Our basic point on the aspirational growth target is that with China slowing down in a structural sense... it will be exceedingly difficult to hit that (2 percent) number, given China's massive arithmetic impact," said Huw McKay, a senior international economist at Westpac.
China's finance chief, Lou Jiwei, noted that stimulus measures also brought problems such as excess capacity, environmental pollution and growing local government debt, just the latest sign that any policy easing there would be limited.
The risks that super-loose monetary policy could inflate asset bubbles was also much discussed by the G20, along with the need for the Federal Reserve to avoid spooking markets as it winds down its quantitative easing campaign.
The US central bank is widely expected to end its asset-buying program in October and to start raising interest rates next year, a marked contrast to the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan where even more easing might be needed.
Bank buffers
Regulators are looking at increasing the size of the capital buffer that the world's top banks need to hold to reduce the risk of a repeat of the global financial crisis.
European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said a buffer of about 16 per cent of risk-weighted assets was realistic but had not been finalised. A figure would be announced at the leaders' summit, he said.
Also on the drawing board were plans to stem the loss of revenue from multinationals shifting their profits to low-tax countries, potentially reclaiming billions of dollars.
Taxation arrangements of global companies such as Google Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have become a hot political topic following media and parliamentary investigations into how many companies reduce their bills.
"We have endorsed far-reaching initiatives to identify and catch tax cheats through the automatic exchange of information using a Common Reporting Standard," Australia's Mr Hockey said.
"We encourage others to match this commitment so that there are no places to hide."

Guests list case: Apex court seeks special public prosecutor helpGuests list case: Apex court agrees to consider NGO’s plea
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 22:  
In a setback to CBI Director Ranjit Sinha, the Supreme Court today agreed to consider a plea for hearing the allegations levelled against him without knowing the name of the whistleblower in a case relating to controversial entries in the visitors’ diary at his residence.
A Bench headed by Justice H L Dattu sought the assistance of the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP), appointed by it for trial in 2G cases, saying that any order passed by it may have ramifications on multi-crore scam cases.
The Bench agreed to hear the plea of NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation which pleaded for recall of its earlier order asking it to reveal the name of the whistleblower in a sealed envelope.
It turned down the plea of the CBI Director’s counsel Vikas Singh that the apex court should not hear the case any further in view of the NGO refusing to disclose the name of “mole” who leaked the documents, including CBI file notings and the register.
“No, no. We are sorry Mr Vikas,” the Bench said when the CBI counsel pleaded that no order should be passed and he should be heard before passing any direction.
Submitting that there has been no interference on his part in any of the cases probed by CBI, Sinha pleaded that continuance of this case even for a single day would cause more public harm and would affect 2G cases.
The Bench, however, said, “We don’t believe so.”
Singh also contended that the NGO must reveal the name of the “mole”, while submitting that the kind of affidavit filed by the NGO (on allegations against Sinha) should not be permitted as otherwise anyone would be allowed to get away even after making baseless allegations in the apex court.
The court directed that all documents, including CBI files and the visitors’ list register pertaining to the allegations against the top cop, be handed over to SPP Anand Grover, who will go through all the information and assist the court on the next date of hearing on October 10.
At the beginning of the proceedings, senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the NGO, and Prashant Bhushan tendered an unconditional apology before the apex court for its “inability” to reveal the name of the whistleblower and pleaded for recall of its earlier order on disclosing the name.
Dave further submitted that it is not an attempt at character assassination of the CBI director but the apex court must look into the allegations levelled against him which need to be probed.

PNB board okays stock split from Rs 10/sh face value to Rs 2This resolution has also enabled us to raise other capital like 81 new instruments that have come.
KR Kamath
CMD
PNB
The Punjab National Bank ( PNB ) board has enabled resolution to raise capital via QIP/FPO/rights issue through a stock split of shares from face value Rs 10 per share to Rs 2 per share in order to bring in retail investors.
KR Kamath, CMD, Punjab National Bank says that the government has not yet decided on how much they will provide to the bank.
The bank is in no hurry to raise capital but its modus operandi will be fixed after government’s equity infusion plan, Kamath says in an interview with CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy.
PNB is trying to keep its capital adequacy ratio at 12 percent, he adds.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: When are you likely to tap the market and is there any preference? Is it likely qualified institutional placement (QIP) or likely follow on public offer (FPO) or a mix of both?
A: The board resolution was an enabling resolution for the bank to raise capital and look at different means depending upon the market situation. The first thing is that the government is yet to decide on the allocation of the funds, which out of Rs 11,400 crore earmarked for the capitalisation of the public sector banks. In case there is an allocation coming to Punjab National Bank and if it’s a good allocation we may even look at rights issue depending upon what the quantum that the government would like to subscribe. If the rights issue is not possible then probably we may look at either QIP or FPO depending upon the circumstances. This resolution has also enabled us to raise other capital like 81 new instruments that have come. So, it was a broader resolution enabling us to go ahead with the raising of the capital and we will take a call once the government’s plan is clear.
Q: Has the government indicated to you that they may be able to provide a little more money, because this morning Dr. Mayaram has been quoted saying that the financial position of the government is actually better, all the ministries will be allowed to spend up to their limits and even that Rs 16,000 crore that they did not borrow in the first half may not be borrowed at all. They are expecting that kind of comfort. So have they given you any comfort, any number in mind as to what you will get by way of capital?
A: They have not yet decided on this issue, they are looking at various options how to go about. Therefore, I do not think that any bank has been indicated any amount on this. We are just waiting for their final plans.
Q: I understand that you tier one capital currently stands at 8.8 percent. What will the tier one look like post this fundraising?
A: We have been looking at keeping the capital adequacy at 12 percent minimum. We are comfortable for a capital adequacy for the current year I do not think even without raising of the issue; just by ploughing back, we will be in a position to manage our capital requirement at a comfortable level. We are not in a hurry to raise but looking at the plans what we have for the growth of the next year onwards; we need to raise the capital. Therefore, we will time it in the second half depending upon how the government comes out with their plan.
Q: What is the reason for the stock split?
A: There is a feeling that more and more retail investors should be brought to the market and where prices are today around Rs 1,000, if the people have to pick it up, it will be very difficult for them to pickup in order to get a retail interest in the stocks. We said that we will split the shares so that anybody who wants to get into can buy our shares.
Q: I believe your panel in PNB is going to listen to representation from Kingfisher as they defend themselves against the willful defaulter tag. Is it true that the meeting is today and what is the process hereon – that panel will take the decision today itself?
A: There is no meeting today. The point is that we had a meeting of grievance redressal committee in the past. The Kingfisher had insisted that their lawyer should be permitted to represent their case. I had taken a stand that this is not a legal issue. It will not permit any lawyers. In a wilful default case, the issue that is getting discussed is that if the funds lent are used for the purpose for which it is lend. I do not think that any lawyer should tell this. It’s a CFO of the company participated and told. He will be the right person to say that whether the funds have used for the right purpose or not. So, they went to the court saying that the lawyers are not been permitted. We are saying that it is not a legal thing neither from our side there is any lawyer nor the people who are sitting on the grievance redressal committee have got a legal background to decide on legal issue. The issue that is getting discussed is a financial discipline at the use of the financial funds. Therefore, the single bench court gave a decision that the lawyer should be allowed and they fixed a date for today. So, we appealed for that saying that – this is again taking out stand and the case could not be heard and the case is kept for tomorrow and the court has said that the grievance meeting need not be held today. So, we are waiting for tomorrow’s court decision to take it forward.

Dipika Pallikal settles for bronze in AsiadDipika Pallikal settles for bronze in Asiad
Press Trust of India | Incheon Sep 22, 2014 11:25 AM IST
Indian squash player Dipika Pallikal could not better the colour of her assured bronze as she lost to world number one Nicol David in the women's singles semifinals of the 17th Asian Games here today.
The 23-year-old Indian was outplayed 4-11 4-11 5-11 by David, who took merely 25 minutes to storm into the final.
The top-seeded Malaysian came into the match as the overwhelming favourite, having not lost a singles match since the sport was introduced in the 1998 Bangkok Games.
And David was in top form from the word go today as well and hardly gave a chance to Pallikal, who had played a draining semifinal match against compatriot Joshana Chinappa yesterday.
India had won three medals (all bronze) out of four categories at Guangzhou 2010 and this time they look good for medals in all four categories including the team event too.
India has so far won four medals (all bronze) at the Asian Games since 1998. Two of them have come courtesy men's singles player Saurav Ghosal and the rest in men's and women's team event.

Pakistan appoints ally of army chief to head ISIPakistan appoints ally of army chief to head ISI
Reuters
Tweet
ISLAMABAD, Sept 22:  
Pakistan has appointed Rizwan Akhtar, considered a close ally of the army chief, to head the country's powerful intelligence agency, the military's press wing said on Monday.
The head of the Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency occupies one of the most important posts in Pakistan, at the intersection of domestic politics, the war on militancy and Pakistan's foreign relations.
Although the ISI officially reports to the prime minister, in reality it is controlled by the army chief, General Raheel Sharif.
Akhtar's previous job was head of the paramilitary Rangers in southeastern Sindh province. He is considered to have extensive experience of counterinsurgency from a previous posting in the border region of South Waziristan.
He will take over as head of the ISI on Oct 1.
"He (Akhtar) is a horribly straight guy, all black and white," said a serving military official who has served with Akhtar.
"He has served in a place like Karachi while remaining neutral and apolitical and has extensive experience of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism. He was the obvious choice."

BJP president Amit Shah Monday called Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and urged him to reconsider his stand on seat sharing in upcoming Maharashtra poll.
The two parties , which have been alliance partners for nearly 25 years, hit a rough patch over seat sharing for October 15 Maharashtra assembly polls.
Sources within the BJP said that Shah called Thackeray Monday morning, and said that the ties between the two parties should not break.
While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wants at least 135 seats to contest, Shiv Sena is not ready to offer anything more than 119 seats in the 288-seat assembly.
The last date for filing nominations is September 27.
BJP sources said Monday that they may soon decide on candidates.
Asked about the chances of the alliance breaking up, BJP spokesperson Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said: “The decision will be announced soon.”

Cant file any final report in coal cases: CBI tocourtPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:55 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 12:59 pm
On Monday, the CBI  told a special court that it would not file further final reports for the time being in any coal blocks allocation scam case as the Supreme Court has restrained it from doing so.
Special Public Prosecutor R S Cheema told Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar that the agency was ready with its supplementary final report in the case involving Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Darda and others but there was an embargo of the apex court.
“We cannot file supplementary final report for the time being as there is an embargo of the Supreme Court. So it would not be appropriate to file it,” Cheema said.
On being asked by the court if there was a bar on filing supplementary reports also, the prosecutor said the apex court had made an oral observation that the agency should not file any charge sheet or closure report in the coal scam cases until further orders.
The special court was hearing the case in which CBI had named in its charge sheet Vijay Darda, his son Devendra Darda, Manoj Jayaswal, director of Nagpur-based AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd, and the firm as accused for offences under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) read with 420 (cheating) of the IPC and under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
The Supreme Court had on September 19 asked the CBI not to take any final decision on any case arising out of multi-crore coal scam after serious allegations were levelled against its Director Ranjit Sinha for protecting some accused.
The court had earlier granted bail to the three accused after they had appeared before it in pursuance to the summons issued against them.
Vijay Darda, Devendra, Jayaswal and the firm were named as accused in the charge sheet filed by CBI on March 27 in which it had alleged that they had fraudulently acquired the coal blocks. They have denied the allegations levelled against them by CBI.
Regarding AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd, CBI had claimed in its FIR that the firm, in its application form for allocation of coal blocks, had “fraudulently” concealed the fact that its group firms had previously been allocated five coal blocks.
Detailing the allocation of coal blocks to AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd, the agency had said the Ministry of Coal invited applications for allocation of coal blocks, including Bander coal block in Maharashtra having geological reserve of 126.105 million metric tonnes (MMT).
CBI had said that the 36th Screening Committee, which was headed by the Coal Secretary, after concluding its deliberations on July 3, 2008, had recommended allocation of Bander coal block jointly to J K Cement Ltd, M/s Century Textiles and Industries Ltd and AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd for their proposed plants in Karnataka and Maharashtra respectively.

On the last date of hearing, Bansal had sought exemption on medical grounds.
Bansal was summoned as a prosecution witness in the case in which his nephew Vijay Singla, suspended Railway Board member Mahesh Kumar and eight others are facing trial.
He had not appeared before the court on the last date of hearing and his counsel Puneet Ahluwalia had told the judge that the Congress leader was unwell as he was suffering from viral fever and he would appear on any date after September 19.
Bansal, who resigned in May 2013 as Railway Minister after the matter came to light, was named as a prosecution witness in the case.
The court had commenced the trial in the case on September 15 in which CBI had chargesheeted 10 accused in 2013.
The court had on March 11 this year framed charges against all the accused under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC read with provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act.
The court had framed charges against Singla, then Member (Staff) of Railway Board Mahesh Kumar, Managing Director of Bangalore-based GG Tronics India Pvt Limited NR Manjunath, alleged middlemen Ajay Garg and Sandeep Goyal and co-accused Rahul Yadav, Sameer Sandhir, Sushil Daga, CV Venugopal and MV Murali Krishan.

It had claimed first tranche of around Rs 90 lakh was given to Singla who was apprehended while accepting the money.

China to cut cotton import quotas to boost demand for domestic fibreChina to cut cotton import quotas to boost demand for domestic fibre
Reuters
Tweet
BEIJING, Sept 22:  
China, the world's top consumer of cotton, will slash its import quotas for 2015 to boost demand for domestic fibre, a senior official said on Monday, in a move that is expected to put downward pressure on international prices.
Beijing will only provide import quotas next year for the 894,000 tonnes that it is required to offer at low duties under commitments with the World Trade Organisation, according to Liu Xiaonan, vice head of the economy and trade department at the National Development and Reform Commission.
Previously, China has offered another type of quota, in addition to the one compliant with the WTO, but Liu said no additional quota would be made available next year.
Non-quota imports are subject to a 40 per cent tariff, so the restricted availability of import quotas will inevitably dampen Chinese demand for foreign cotton.
In the 2013/14 marketing year, traders estimated that Beijing had issued 600,000-800,000 tonnes through the additional quota that will not be available next year.
"Apart from the 894,000 tonnes of import quota required under WTO entry commitments...we will not issue additional import quota, instead guiding domestic textile companies to use more Chinese cotton," NRDC's Liu told reporters.
To encourage domestic producers, China will offer subsidies to provinces in the Yellow River and Yangtze River valley growing areas, said another official at NDRC.
The government had previously said a new direct subsidy for cotton farmers would only be available to Xinjiang, the country's top growing region, raising fears that domestic cotton output would drop sharply.
The change in quota policy will hurt major exporters such as the United States where Chinese demand has played a key role in influencing fibre prices.
"The very clear effect of this will be big selling pressure," said a trade source in China. "Foreign cotton prices should go down to allow China to consume more imports."
Prices on the international market ICE hit near-five-year lows in August as the market anticipated weaker fibre demand in China ahead of an overhaul of its policy.
The government said earlier this year it would end a three-year long programme to stockpile domestic cotton to support local growers, and instead offer subsidies direct to farmers.
The stockpiling had pushed the price of domestic cotton well above market prices, creating demand for cheaper imported fibre.
China's cotton imports dropped by 32 per cent in the 2013/14 year to 3 million tonnes, owing to weaker demand by the domestic textile sector and mills importing yarn instead of cotton.
Imports are expected to fall further in the current year to 1.74 million tonnes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Liu did not disclose whether next year's import quota will be tied to domestic purchases.
ICE cotton prices slumped on Friday, after an industry website reported that Beijing may link a large amount of the WTO quota to domestic cotton purchases.
China will consider auctioning cotton from state reserves after the main buying season ends in March, if demand has not been satisfied by the new fibre crop, added Liu.

HONG KONG, Sept 22:  
China shares tumbled on Monday as a new batch of initial public offerings started taking subscriptions while investors worried that a flash manufacturing survey due on Tuesday could be more evidence the Chinese economy is slowing significantly.
The wave of 12 IPOs is expected to lock up 600 billion yuan ($97.75 billion) in funds, according to a National Business Daily report, aggravating quarter-end liquidity pressures.
The Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.7 per cent to 2,289.87 points. The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings closed down 1.9 per cent.
A private flash PMI reading on China September factory output on Tuesday could come in below the 50 level, indicating that manufacturing activity is contracting. The median of a Reuters poll was 50.0, which is the demarcation point between expansion and contraction.

French govt ups pressure for end to Air France strikeFrench govt ups pressure for end to Air France strike
Reuters
Tweet
PARIS, Sept 22:  
The French government made a renewed appeal on Monday for a quick end to an Air France pilots strike which is costing the flag-carrier millions of euros a day, urging management to "clarify" its proposals.
The strike over the airline's plans to establish low-cost activities is entering its second week and set to be the longest such industrial action in its history. The main SNPL union has extended strike action to Sept. 26 and a second union, SPAF, to Sept. 24 with an option to extend further.
"Service must resume right now, that's what the country wants and all those involved must understand that," Jean-Marie Le Guen, minister in charge of relations with parliament, said before new talks on Monday between unions and management.
"Very quickly, the management must make a certain number of clarifications on their proposals," he added.
The pilots are protesting over plans to expand the low-cost operations of its Transavia unit by setting up foreign bases as Air France seeks to fight back against fierce competition from budget carriers.
The expansion of Transavia is part of a new plan unveiled this month aimed at boosting earnings. The proposals would see Transavia's fleet rise to 100 jets by 2017, from about 50 now, and the number of passengers more than double to 20 million.
The SNPL is concerned Air France would abandon Transavia's development in France altogether, blaming it on pilot opposition, to focus on the unit's expansion elsewhere in Europe, thus moving jobs outside the country.
Air France, part of Air France-KLM, expects 41 per cent of its flights to operate on Monday. SNPL said ahead of the new meeting that talks had reached "a complete impasse".
The industrial action began on Sept. 15, and Air France estimates it is costing the company 10 million to 15 million euros ($13-19 million) a day, implying the cost of the walkout could rise to as much as 180 million euros by Sept. 26.
Air France-KLM is currently expected to post 2014 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 2.28 billion euros and pre-tax profit of 79 million, according to the average of analysts' estimates on Thomson Reuters Eikon.
The StarMine SmartEstimate is for a full-year pretax loss of 19 million. The airline forecast 2014 EBITDA of 2.2-2.3 billion euros and has not given new forecasts since the strike began.
Transavia posted a 64 million euro operating loss in the first six months of this year, 10 million more than a year earlier due mainly to the ramp-up of Transavia France. Passenger traffic rose 6.9 percent year-on-year.
Air France's share price shed about 3.0 percent in early market trading on Monday.

Germany rules out air strikes  ground troops againstISGermany announced last month to arm and train the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, who are battling IS militants in Iraq.
Press Trust of India | Berlin | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:44 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 2:50 pm
Germany has ruled out participation in air strikes or any other ground offensive against the Islamic State (IS) militants in Iraq, denying reports that it was under pressure to provide air support to the US forces .
“There is no question of German soldiers getting involved in an armed conflict in Iraq,” Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a TV interview last night.
Steinmeier denied reports Germany was under pressure to join the US and France in air strikes against the IS in Iraq.
“No, the coalition doesn’t work that way,” he said, adding that the international alliance, which was formed recently to eliminate the threat posed by the jihadist group, will operate on the basis of a “division of labour” and Germany has taken over its responsibilities.

Germany announced last month to arm and train the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, who are battling IS militants in Iraq.
Alliance partners have appreciated Germany’s decision to supply ‘Milan’ anti-tank missiles, thousands of machine guns, transport vehicles and night vision equipment to the Kurdish forces, he said.
Moreover, German soldiers are involved in distributing humanitarian assistance to the Kurdish provincial capital Irbil, he said.

Steinmeier stressed the need for an international strategy to degrade and destroy IS.
He also rejected the possibility of cooperation between the West and the Syrian government to combat IS in Syria.
He also voiced his opposition to lifting a ban on the activities of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), even though it had offered to protect Yezidis, Christians and other minorities in Iraq persecuted by the IS militants.

HTC to make the upcoming 9-inch Google NexustabletGoogle's decision to pick HTC reflects its long-term strategy of building a broad base of partners from device to device to prevent any one manufacturer from gaining a monopoly.
Reuters | Washington | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:41 pm
Google Inc has selected HTC Corp to make its upcoming 9-inch Nexus tablet, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Google had been mulling HTC as a potential Nexus tablet partner since last year and HTC engineers have been flying to the Googleplex in Mountain View in recent months to work on the project, the report said.
Google’s decision to pick HTC reflects its long-term strategy of building a broad base of partners from device to device to prevent any one manufacturer from gaining a monopoly, the report said.
That may also be one of the reasons why Google chose HTC over bigger rivals Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, maker of the Nexus 10 tablet.
Representatives at Google were not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. HTC declined to comment on the report.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has been re-admitted to hospital for a post surgery check-up, his doctor said on Monday.
Jaitley, who had undergone a surgery to control diabetes earlier this month, was admitted last evening to Max hospital in Saket and is likely to be discharged on Tuesday.
According to sources close to the Minister, Jaitley is keeping fine but he is under observation.
All of Jaitley’s engagements, including the launch of an updated version of CBDT website, have been cancelled.
“Jaitley was admitted on Sunday at 6 pm for a planned routine follow-up for the assessment of his kidney functioning parameters,” said Dr Pradeep K Chowbey, Executive Vice-Chairman of Max Healthcare and Director of Max Institute of Minimal Access, Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.
The Minister also complained of a minor stomach infection, sources added.
Earlier this month, the 61-year-old BJP leader had undergone an elective laproscopic procedure for diabetes management. He was discharged on September 10.

PIA crew detained for smugglingiPhonesPress Trust of India | Lahore | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:27 pm
Most of the cabin crew of a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight were detained by customs authorities at the airport here for allegedly smuggling 24 iPhones worth about Rs 2.5 million and also foreign currency.
The incident yesterday caused panic at the airport, besides delaying a Manchester-bound PIA flight for a couple of hours, after the crew staged a sit-in against the detention of their colleagues.
The customs authorities had information that 11 of the 14 crew members of PK-758 flight, including the captain and a purser, brought over 20 iPhones-5S (worth over Rs 105,000 each) from London on Friday during its launch, Dawn reported.
“The accused are office-bearers of the PIA staff union (CBA) and they did it under a plan. They first managed to get their duties changed by requesting the actual crew members for the flight in connivance with the relevant admin staff,” Dawn quoted a senior PIA official as saying.
He said the accused left for London to purchase iPhones at cheap rates to sell them in Pakistan at higher prices.
He said some of their rivals in the union informed the customs officials about the plan before their return.
“As soon as the crew members reported in the lounge after landing of the plane, the authorities searched them. But they did not find iPhones. Later, they learnt that the accused had handed over the phones to a passenger,” the official said.
The phones were later recovered from the passenger.
The authorities also reportedly recovered 5,000 British pounds from the captain and some other crew.
The official said then the accused called their fellow crew members who were about to depart for Manchester.
The crew members, along with some other union staff, staged a sit-in and chanted slogans against the authorities for harassing them.
The protests ended after the detained crew members were released.
A PIA spokesman said an inquiry had been launched.
“Since it is a serious matter, an inquiry is under way. We will be able to tell who is responsible for the incident after the inquiry,” the spokesman said.

Modi govt to implement eco-friendly  growth friendlypoliciesNarendra Modi-led government is taking the necessary measures to fast track the process of regulatory clearances for a faster economic growth. (Reuters)
New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:20 pm
Prakash Javadekar, minister for environment, forests and climate change has said that environmental norms would be made more stringent and practical keeping in mind the enormity of the problem and issues involved and industry concerns. The stakeholders would be consulted in the process so as to ensure complete compliance once the norms are laid down. Referring to the revision of norms related to the cement industry undertaken recently, the minister said that these norms were implemented taking into account the concerns of the industry.
The minister stated this while addressing the Sustainable & Inclusive Solutions Summit held in New Delhi last week. The event was organised by the CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development, with The Financial Express as its print media partner.
Elaborating further, the minister said that the cooperation of the industry stakeholders was critical in the context of monitoring, evaluation and implementation of environmental norms. This would enable the government to implement “eco friendly and growth friendly” policies. At the same time the ministry in the last three months had undertaken a number of measures to ensure compliance, timelines that laid to transparency and positivity in decision making. Referring to the proposals related to online application and tracking of environment and forests proposals, Javadekar said around 250 online applications for TORs for environmental clearances had been received. The ministry was taking the necessary measures to fast track the process of regulatory clearances for a faster economic growth, while ensuring that development and conservation of environment go hand in hand and in a transparent manner. These measures were intended to bring in more transparency, efficiency and accountability in grant of regulatory clearances.
Javadekar also emphasised that the use of technology, creation of infrastructure and their proactive and sustainable management would ensure a clean environment in the future. The minister specifically referred to the decision taken on installing round the clock sensors for monitoring pollution and flow of affluents into the Ganges. The minister emphasised upon the seamless integration of economic growth, human development and ecological protection.
YC Deveshwar, past president, CII, chairman, CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development Advisory Council and chairman, ITC, highlighted how the world has exhausted its budget of resources for the year and will now be living on borrowed resources from the future. Fifty years ago it was using three-fourth of the available resources and today.

Seat-sharing row: Amit Shah calls Uddhav as BJP  Sena bicker over  final  offerComments
The deadlock over seat-sharing between the BJP and the Shiv Sena continued Monday but the alliance partners appeared willing to accommodate each other’s concerns, keeping hopes of reconciliation alive.
The BJP sent a fresh proposal to the Shiv Sena, offering to contest 130 seats -- five down from its initial demand of 135 --- in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly but also hinted it was ready to go it alone.
A day after it made the senior ally the “final offer” of 119 seats, the Sena -– through informal channels -- indicated it was willing to concede another six seats to the BJP, sources said. The Sena had Sunday set aside 151 seats for itself.
For weeks, the saffron combine has been fighting bitterly over the number of seats each party will contest in the October 15 state election.
The alliance fancies its chances this time and whichever party gets more seats, will also get the CM’s post.
“In a contingent situation that the BJP is compelled not to contest with the Shiv Sena, we would go it alone on all 288 seats but we will prefer that Shiv Sena comes along,” BJP general secretary in-charge for Maharashtra Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
Video: BJP leaders to meet Shiv Sena to save Maharashtra alliance
The BJP, said sources, was yet to receive a formal response from Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on its fresh demand for 130 seats.
“We have shown some flexibility... Sena should give us those seats where chances of its victory are nil.” There are some 59 seats that the Sena has not won in last five elections.
Late Sunday, the party’s central election committee had finalised candidates for more than 200 seats, sources said. In case of a split, the BJP would “accommodate” the three smaller parties that are part of the Mahayuti, or the grand alliance, the sources said.
Rudy has been asked go to Mumbai and settle things in the next two-three days. September 27 is the last day of filing election papers. The party’s election in-charge Om Mathur is already in Mumbai.
 
Thackeray had called up two senior BJP leaders on Sunday, but failed to secure any concession, a BJP leader told HT. The party, said sources, would wait for the “inauspicious” Pitrapaksha to end -- on September 24 --before announcing candidates.
Read: BJP rejects Sena's 'final' offer
The BJP leaders say they want the alliance to work but a break-up with Sena wouldn’t put the party at a disadvantage.
“We will get an opportunity to make inroads in urban areas where Modi magic will give us an advantage,” a BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.
Rudy earlier said that his party had sent “a very liberal proposal” to Sena as the 130 seats include the “worst” possible seats which its ally had never won in last 30 years. Traditionally, the Shiv Sena has fought more seats than the BJP, which wants a bigger share this time following its Lok Sabha victory.

Mamata s nephew mocks Jadavpur student protestWB govt to probe Jadavpur University molestation
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Kolkata, September 22, 2014

After wide protests by students, the West Bengal government Monday announced a probe into the alleged sexual harassment of a female student of Jadavpur University.
"The panel headed by, Suranjan Das, vice-chancellor of Calcutta University will submit its report by Thursday morning," said Education Minister Partha Chatterjee, who met the victim at her residence.
The five-member panel includes eminent Indologist Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri and West Bengal School Service Commission Chairman Subiresh Bhattacharya.
While the university formed a panel to investigate the alleged incident where a female student was dragged into the boys' hostel and molested last month, the students have been demanding an independent probe panel.

Earlier Trinamool Congress Yuva president and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee,  triggered fresh controversy by taking a dig at the Jadavpur University  students’ agitation on his Facebook page.  
 
Abhisek's post has lent a fresh dimension to the controversy that is raging across West Bengal over the past few days following an alleged crackdown of the police on JU students last Tuesday.
 
“The students are agitating as there has been a crackdown against consumption of booze, ganja and charas on the Jadavpur University campus,” wrote Abhishek in a Facebook post in Bengali.
 
Twenty-seven-year old Abhishek is the Lok Sabha MP from Diamond Harbour constituency in South 24 Parganas district.
 
Incidentally, last week chief minister Mamata Banerjee described the JU agitation as a "small matter" during a ceremony in Kolkata.
 
"A mountain is being made out of a molehill," said the chief minister.
 
While most students and teachers of the JU say Banerjee's comment is an attempt to break the movement, some feel that the remark is an outcome of the immense pressure on the party from the media and growing sections of the civil society.
 
 “What is evident from the Facebook post updated by Trinamool Congress youth wing president is that he is not aware of JU’s global standing. Every student dreams of getting admission to JU after the higher secondary examination. It is showing that the ruling party is under a lot of pressure,” said a student of the university.
 
"The culture of the ruling party has deteriorated to such depths that it is impossible for them to appreciate the language of the JU students' protest," said Srutinath Praharaj, leader of West Bengal College and University Teachers' Association, a Left-leaning teacher's organisation.
 
“It is extremely disappointing to see a post like this. This is nothing but an attempt to break our movement,” added Nilanjana Gupta, another teacher.
 
Politicians from opposing parties too joined in condemning Abhisek’s post.
 
“First they said Maoists were behind the incident. When they found thousands of students from all campuses were joining the agitation, they shifted that stance. Now they have found Trinamool Congress is losing support on this question, and therefore, they are resorting to such allegations,” said state BJP president Rahul Sinha.
 
"They can't think of anything beyond alcohol. It is just an attempt to malign the movement," said CPI(M) central committee leader, Md Selim.
 
JU students have been protesting demanding the resignation of the vice-chancellor, the pro V-C and the registrar of the university in the wake of alleged police assault on students early on September 17.
 
Thousands of students had marched through the city's streets on Saturday demanding resignation of JU vice-chancellor Abhijit Chakrabarti and West Bengal governor KN Tripathi intervened to end the four-day old stalemate in the prestigious educational institution.
 
Students from Presidency University, Calcutta University and other educational institutions joined the march in a show of solidarity.
 
JU students have boycotted classes to press the demand for the V-C's resignation. Those in the mass communication department boycotted their examination on September 18.

Will Yahoo use Alibaba cash to buy AOLYahoo is cashing in on part of its Alibaba stake.
Will it buy AOL with the money?
There have been rumors about a Yahoo ( YHOO , Tech30 ) and AOL ( AOL , Tech30 ) merger for years -- pretty much since CNNMoney owner Time Warner ( TWC ) spun off AOL as a separate company in 2009.
But the chatter has increased lately because Yahoo is expected to generate more than $5 billion (after taxes) from the sale of part of its investment in Alibaba ( BABA ), which went public Friday in what turned out to be the biggest IPO in history.
Shares of Alibaba surged about 40% from their offering price.
What will Alibaba's closing price be? Vote!
Shares of AOL popped more than 3% late Thursday after the derivatives team at brokerage firm BGC Partners wrote in a report that "post the Alibaba IPO, there is a possibility that Yahoo may seek to deploy its cash by pursuing AOL as an acquisition target." The stock gave back most of those gains Friday. Yahoo's stock was lower too.
The Yahoo-AOL merger rumors never really went away. Will a deal finally happen?
Yahoo could clearly afford AOL, which now has a market value of about $3.4 billion. So Yahoo could theoretically pay a 50% premium for AOL if it wanted to use all of its newfound Alibaba money. (That seems unlikely though, given that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has promised investors she'll use some of the cash to buy back some Yahoo stock.)
Still, the question is why should Yahoo buy AOL in the first place?
Related: Put up or shut up time for Yahoo and Marissa Mayer
Colin Gillis, who covers Yahoo's stock for BGC Partners, says that a deal would make sense. He thinks Yahoo would benefit from AOL's expansion in online video.
It is true that the two companies could mesh well. Yahoo has built up a solid news outfit (especially its finance and sports units) and AOL owns The Huffington Post. A combined Yahoo/AOL would have some quality content ... and we all know that content is king.
It's also possible that Mayer could get along well with AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. Both of them used to work for Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ).
But it's not clear that a combined Yahoo and AOL would be able to do a better job of stealing online ad dollars away from Google, Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ), Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) and others.
Growth at Yahoo has remained sluggish since Mayer took over in 2012. A flurry of buzzy acquisitions have helped restore a cool factor to the company. But they've done little to boost revenue and profits.
Many experts argue that the sole reason Yahoo's stock has done as well as it has recently (up 37% in the past 12 months) is due to excitement about its Alibaba stake.
 
What will Yahoo do with Alibaba cash?
And despite efforts by AOL to shed its old subscription-based business model, that division is not dead yet. It still accounts for more than 25% of AOL's total sales and is dragging down growth levels for the whole company. Would Yahoo really want to own that?
Eric Jackson, managing partner of Ironfire Capital, a hedge fund that owns shares of Yahoo, said no.
He thinks the only way a Yahoo-AOL merger could work would be if there were mass layoffs, especially on the sales side. And Jackson doesn't believe Mayer wants to do that since she's been mainly focusing on buying startups and bringing on new talent.

Jackson said that if Yahoo is going to use some of its Alibaba couch cushion cash to make a deal, it would be more likely to buy an online ad company. He said that either Rocket Fuel ( FUEL ) or The Rubicon Project ( RUBI ), two recently public ad tech firms that have fallen sharply from their highs, could be bargains.
A splashier purchase could be AppNexus, a privately held online ad tech company that just raised a new round of financing which values it at $1.2 billion .
But Jackson said the best move may be to sit tight with the cash -- and possibly try to sell itself instead of looking for other things to acquire. He said he'd love it if Japan's SoftBank ( SFTBY ), which also owns a huge chunk of Alibaba, made an offer for Yahoo.
"I hope Yahoo doesn't buy anything. I'm a little fearful of what Mayer will do with that cash," he said.

Alibaba surges 38% on massive demand in mkt debutLiana B. Baker, Jessica Toonkel and Ryan Vlastelica        Last Updated: September 20, 2014  | 22:28 IST

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's shares soared 38 per cent in their first day of trading on Friday as investors jumped at the chance for a piece of what is likely to rank as the largest IPO in history , in a massive bet on China's burgeoning middle class.
It was an auspicious debut for the Chinese e-commerce company , which was founded by Jack Ma in his apartment in 1999 and now accounts for 80 per cent of online sales in China.
About 100 people gathered outside the New York Stock Exchange at Wall and Broad Streets, many of them Chinese tourists with cameras, and they cheered and snapped photos when Ma exited the building with the kung fu star Jet Li.
The stock opened at $92.70 shortly before noon ET (1600 GMT) and quickly rose to a high of $99.70, before paring gains to close at $93.89. Some 271 million shares changed hands, more than double the turnover on Twitter Inc's first day last year, although still short of volume for the General Motors Co and Facebook Inc IPOs.
"This is the most anticipated event I've ever seen in my 20-year career on the floor of the NYSE," said Mark Otto, partner with J. Streicher & Co, who trades on the NYSE floor. "I think today's move is sustainable: The company is profitable, unlike some of its competitors, and it is a way for traders to tap into the Chinese growth story."
The pricing of the IPO on Thursday initially raised $21.8 billion for Alibaba. Scott Cutler, head of the New York Stock Exchange's global listing business, told CNBC that underwriters would exercise their option for an additional 48 million shares, to bring the IPO's size to about $25 billion, making it the largest initial public offering in history.
But a source close to the matter said the underwriters would make a final decision on whether to exercise the option over the next week or two, based on how the shares trade over the next few sessions.
Alibaba is nearly unknown to most Americans but is ubiquitous in China. The company, which operates China's largest Internet shopping destination, Taobao, and retail site Tmall.com, earned $3.7 billion in the 12 months ended March 31, 2014, up about $2 billion from the prior 12-month period.
At its closing share price on Friday, Alibaba has a market value of $231 billion, exceeding the combined market capitalizations of Amazon and eBay, the two leading U.S. e-commerce companies.
Alibaba is valued at 39 times its estimated earnings per share for its current fiscal year, which ends in March. That is right in line with Facebook's valuation of 39 times forward earnings but nowhere near the lofty valuation of Amazon.com's multiple of 264, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine data.
TRYING TO CHART THE STOCK'S FUTURE
The future path of Alibaba's shares is truly uncharted territory.
"It's very difficult to predict," said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. "Is it going to trade based upon its true fundamental value, or is it going to become one of these cult stocks a la Tesla or Solar City, or some of these names where there really isn't a fundamental grounding to the valuation?
"And it's very difficult to see what bucket these guys are going to fall into," Massocca added. "My guess is there's a very high likelihood it does fall into this bucket, which would lead you to believe it does trade higher. But if you were to base it on a fundamental valuation, I would call it slightly overvalued at this price."
Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy said that while he expected Alibaba to further grow revenues, it was entering an aggressive new investment stage that would likely pinch margins over the next couple of quarters.
Ma, a former English teacher who is now the company's executive chairman, boasts a personal fortune of more than $14 billion on paper, vaulting him into the ranks of such tech billionaires as Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. The deal is also expected to make millionaires out of a substantial chunk of Alibaba's managers, software engineers and other staff.
The rise in the stock exceeds the average gain by new IPOs on U.S. exchanges of late. In the second quarter, the average first-day gain was 9.2 percent, according to Renaissance Capital IPO Intelligence. Underwriters usually aim for a gain of 10 per cent to 15 per cent on the first day.
Twitter last year saw its shares surge 73 per cent on their first trading day.
Demand was intense among retail investors. J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at retail brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, said the company received customer orders amounting to about 70 per cent of what it saw for Facebook and about three times the customer orders it had for Twitter's IPO.
Assuming underwriters elect to sell additional shares, the company's initial public offering will become the largest in history, surpassing listings by Agricultural Bank of China Ltd's in 2010 and by ICBC, another Chinese lender, in 2006.
WHAT HAPPENED IN HONG KONG
Alibaba Group's orange banners were festooned around the exchange, with its logo on NYSE computer screens. Ma watched several long-time customers ring the opening bell at 9:30 a.m.
"I don't want disappointed shareholders, I want to make sure they make money," Ma said of the pricing, on CNBC, adding that he worries most about keeping customers happy.
Similar euphoria greeted Alibaba.com when its stock debuted on the stock exchange in Hong Kong in November 2007 on the eve of the global financial crisis. The stock more than tripled on day one, but five years later Ma delisted the company at the IPO price after failing to impress investors.
The NYSE held extensive tests ahead of the hotly anticipated offering to ensure it would be able to handle heavy trading volume. A call on Friday with periodic updates on order matching and trading continued until about noon ET.
"We've had a lot of major IPOs, and when you have one it's always the biggest until the next biggest one comes along," said Ted Weisberg, floor trader with Seaport Securities in New York, who has been a member of the NYSE for 45 years.
The deal allows cornerstone Alibaba investors such as Japan's Softbank Corp and Yahoo Inc to profit from getting in on the ground floor at the company. Yahoo sold some $8 billion worth of shares in the offering, leaving it with a 16.3 percent stake. Shares of Yahoo were hit on Friday, dropping 2.7 percent.
Softbank is not selling for now and will be left with a 32 percent stake, making it the largest single shareholder.
In a measure of the mystique the Alibaba name carries with investors, shares in advertising company Chinanet Online Holdings Inc soared 92 percent to $1.96 after it announced discussions were under way with Alibaba to offer digital advertising services to its online shopping site Taobao.

Scientists to carry out tests on September 22, two days before D-Day
timeline
The test-firing of the propulsion system on India’s spacecraft to Mars for four seconds on September 22, along with the orbiter’s trajectory correction manoeuvre (TCM), is “a mock-up rehearsal” for the entire Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) team for the main event scheduled on September 24, according to M. Annadurai, Programme Director, Indian Remote-Sensing Satellites and Small Satellites Systems, ISRO.
“The September 22 firing of the 440 Newton engine on our Mars orbiter is more like a trial. It will confirm the engine coming to life after it has remained dormant on the spacecraft for 300 days,” he said. He likened the firing of the engine and the TCM to “a repeat” of the spacecraft’s trans-Mars injection on December 1, 2013, when it was shot out of its earth-bound orbit into a sun-centric orbit and its 300-day voyage to the Red Planet began.
If the trial firing of the 440 Newton engine/the Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) is a success, Dr. Annadurai said, “then everything will go well on September 24 as per our plan.”
September 24 is the D-day for ISRO. That day its ground-controllers will give commands from its sophisticated Mission Operations Complex (MOX)-2 in Bangalore for the 440 Newton engine to fire for 24 minutes from 7.17 a.m. to reduce the spacecraft’s velocity and insert it into the Martian orbit. Ground controllers have already loaded the commands into the spacecraft for the events on September 22 and 24 and verified them too. “Basically, we don’t believe in the 11 hour preparations. Having prepared well for the examination and checked our systems ten days ahead, our confidence-level for the Mars orbit insertion is high,” Dr. Annadurai said.
S. Arunan, Project Director, MOM, said that by test-firing the LAM engine for four seconds, ISRO would be able to evaluate its performance in normal conditions. “If coil 1 is not successful, we will use coil 2. We will ensure that LAM performs either with the main or redundant coil. We will do this along with the TCM – to bring down the spacecraft altitude by 200 km.”

4 Indian Cities in Asian Top Destinations ListKisan Vikas Patra Vs Bank FD: What You Should Know
Mumbai: Four Indian cities - Agra, Ahmedabad, Kochi and Panaji - feature among the Asian Top 10 list of a global survey when it comes to last-minute bookings for luxury destinations.
The four Indian cities have been listed amongst the Asian Top 10 luxurious but affordable destinations, according to a survey by global online hotel search site Trivago.
The data was compiled by Europe, North and Central America, South America, Oceania, Southeast Asia, Middle East, Asia and Africa.
Agra in Uttar Pradesh is second on the list, with an average price of Rs 5,220 per night, followed by Ahmedabad in Gujarat securing the third position with Rs 5,275 per night, the survey revealed.
Kochi is placed 7th in the list with a tariff of Rs 5,660 per night on an average, while Panaji, Goa is on the eighth position at an average of Rs 5,673 per night, it said.
"Recent price wars between airline companies should give a good combination for Indian travellers, who are still looking to vacation abroad or within India. Prices for top star hotels in Panaji and Kochi are quite favourable right now to enjoy high quality at better price," Trivago India's representative, Abhinav Kumar, said.
China's Zhuhai city topped the list at Rs 4,169 per night, the survey revealed.
Three other Chinese cities - Guangzhou (4), Dongguan (5) and Shenzhen (6) - featured in the list, with average room prices of Rs 5,454, Rs 5,480 and Rs 5,500, respectively.
Taiwan's Kaohusiung city secured the ninth position at Rs 6,603 per night and Taichung city was ranked 10th at Rs 6,694 per night among the Asian Top 10 luxurious but affordable destinations.

India can rise again  match with China; I have a clear roadmap  says ModiPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 21, 2014 6:56 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 1:14 am
Asserting that India does not need to follow Chinese model for a rapid economic progress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he has a “clear roadmap” to channel people’s entrepreneurial nature towards achieving 8 to 9 per cent growth rates for a longer period.
The Prime Minister also hoped China, which has been aggressive in the matters relating to the South China Sea and the East Sea, would accept global laws and play a cooperating role as Beijing does not want to stand isolated.
Asked by CNN’s Fareed Zakaria if the Prime Minister felt the pace of development in China was faster because of its authoritarian rule and slower in India due to its democratic set up, Modi said, “If China is one example, then democratic countries provide another example. They have also grown fast. You can’t say that growth is not possible because of democracy. Democracy is our commitment. It is our great legacy, a legacy we simply cannot compromise. Democracy is in our DNA.”
When pressed further, the PM said, “See, I have seen the strength of democracy. If there were no democracy then someone like me, Modi, a child born in a poor family, how would he sit here? This is the strength of democracy.”
On comparison with China on the economic front, he replied, “India does not need to become anything else. India must become only India. This is a country that once upon a time was called ‘the golden bird’… If you see the details of the last five or 10 centuries, you will see that India and China have grown at similar paces. Their contributions to global GDP have risen in parallel, and fallen in parallel.
“Today’s era once again belongs to Asia. India and China are both growing rapidly, together. That is why India needs to remain India.”
“It is my absolute belief that Indians have unlimited talent. I have no doubt about our capabilities. I have a lot of faith in the entrepreneurial nature of our 1.25 billion people. There is a lot of capability. And I have a clear road-map to channel it,” Modi replied to a query that can India achieve 8 to 9 per cent growth rates that China has done consistently for 30 years.
Asked about China’s behaviour in the South China and the East sea that has left many of its neighbours worried, he said, “India is different… We can’t run our country if we get worried about every small thing. At the same time, we can’t close our eyes to problems. That’s why India maintains that we are now in a different era. We are not living in the 18th century. China is also a country with an ancient cultural heritage. Look at how it has focused on economic development. It’s hardly the sign continued…

Modi to meet Netanyahu at UNGA

PTI Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first address on the world stage will be at the United Nations General Assembly.

Modi-Sharif meet remains uncertain on UNGA sidelines.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first address on the world stage at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) will be followed by several meetings of international and regional importance.
Sources confirmed to The Hindu that officials are trying to work out a schedule for a possible meeting between Mr. Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the UNGA.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will also meet her Israeli counterpart on October 1 for a bilateral meeting, which is expected to set the course for future engagements. The meeting with the Israeli leadership will be significant for several reasons. This will be the first meeting since the Gaza crisis, where India nuanced its position between Israel and Palestine. Israel was among the handful of countries Mr. Modi visited before becoming Prime Minister, and the BJP had advocated recognising Israel before the Centre did so in 1992.
Modi-Sharif meet remains uncertain on UNGA sidelines
India’s reaching out to Israel, as well as a possible meeting with Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas will be a distinct departure from previous years, when the Prime Minister used the post-UNGA speech windows to meet regional leaders.
In 2013, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with leaders of Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh on the sidelines of the UNGA.
While the Ministry of External Affairs has confirmed a meeting with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this year, a meeting with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa is also expected on September 27, soon after Mr. Modi’s speech that morning.
Sharif meet?
While both Indian and Pakistani governments say there is “no proposal” for Mr. Modi to meet Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, their schedules in New York overlap by a couple of days. Speculation over a possible meeting grew as officials confirmed that Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit met National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh on September 13, before he flew back to Islamabad for consultations.
A Pakistani official described the meetings as “constructive and useful engagements,” but couldn’t confirm if a summit-level meeting is planned.
Sources say much will depend on Mr. Sharif’s speech at the UNGA a day before Mr. Modi’s.
Last year, Mr. Sharif’s reference to “the suffering of people in Jammu and Kashmir” had led to a sharp retort by Mr. Singh who had called Pakistan the “epicentre of terrorism” in South Asia. Given that no meeting has been scheduled yet between the leaders, their speeches will be watched keenly for any signs of a possible revival of the Foreign Secretary-level talks that were cancelled in July.

ET Wealth: Why you should buy ULIPs 2.0Allianz
(While the low charges of…)
They were once the most bought financial product. Then Ulips became the most reviled investment, forcing a string of reformatory measures. Now these investment-cum-insurance plans have changed once again to become a low-cost investment option. In fact, some of the Ulips introduced in recent months are cheaper than the direct plans of mutual funds.
We won't be surprised if this evokes an angry response from readers. Ulip became a four-letter word due to the high charges levied by insurance companies and rampant mis-selling by distributors. In some cases, the charges were as high as 80% of the premium in the first year. Distributors lured gullible investors by not revealing the high charges and showcasing only the returns offered by the market-linked product.
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) clamped down in 2010, capping the annualised charges of Ulips at 2.25% for the first 10 years of holding. The charges were fixed at this rate because it was the average cost charged by competing products such as mutual funds. With no incentive left for distributors, Ulip sales plunged after the Irda guidelines came into effect. Though Ulips had become a very cost-effective investment, nobody was buying them because nobody was selling them.
In recent months, insurance companies have sweetened the deal for investors by reducing the charges even further. The Bajaj Allianz Future Gain plan does not levy premium allocation charges if the annual investment is Rs 2 lakh and above. The Edelweiss Tokio Wealth Accumulation Plan doesn't have policy administration charges. Some Ulips, such as Aviva i-Growth and ICICI Prudential Elite Life II, don't have lower charges but compensate long-term investors with 'loyalty additions'. "The plan works out cheaper because we return the money to the long-term investors," says Rishi Piparaiya, director, marketing & direct sales, Aviva Life Insurance.
But the Click2invest plan from HDFC Life is a game changer for the segment. The only charge it levies is an annual fund management fee of 1.35% of the corpus value. There is also a mortality charge but that is for the life cover offered to the policyholder. The low charges make the Click2invest plan cheaper than even the direct plan of a diversified equity fund. For instance, the direct plan of the largest equity scheme, HDFC Equity Fund, charges an expense ratio of 1.5% per year. "The Click2invest plan is costefficient and, therefore, comparable with the direct plans of mutual funds," says Sanjay Tripathy, senior EVP, marketing and product, HDFC Life (Click here for interview) .
Some readers may pooh-pooh the idea of saving a sliver on costs. After all, a 0.15% saving on costs makes a difference of only Rs 150 on an investment of Rs 1 lakh. While this may seem small, the difference in the cost can balloon into substantial savings in the long term (see graphic). As the graphic shows, the difference in the corpus value of various levels of returns is not very substantial in the initial years, but in 30 years, even a 0.5% difference in returns will widen the gap between 9.5% returns and 9% by Rs 15.4 lakh.
  Shed your aversion to Ulips
This transformation of Ulips from a costly bundled product to a low-cost option has led to a change of heart among financial planners as well. For long, they have advised clients to keep insurance and investment separate. "We used to advise against mixing insurance and investment because of the high costs of Ulips. A combination of mutual funds for investment and term plans for life insurance worked out to be cheaper," says S Sridharan, head of financial planning, FundsIndia.com. "However, low-cost products like this will be suitable for investors who want to combine insurance with investments," he adds.
He's not alone. With more low-cost Ulips on the anvil (at least two companies are awaiting Irda's approval for their low-cost Ulips), many financial planners are changing their tune. "The Click2invest plan from HDFC Life is a good product. We are recommending it to our clients," says Jaya Nagarmat from Investor Shoppe. Tanvir Alam, founder & CEO of Fincart goes a step further. "This Ulip will give the mutual fund industry a run for its money," he says.

Railgate: Pawan Kumar Bansal appears as witnessCongress
(Pawan Kumar Bansal, who…)
NEW DELHI: Former Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal today appeared in a Delhi court to depose as a prosecution witness in the Rs 10 crore cash-for-post railway bribery case in which his nephew is also an accused.
Prior to recording his statement Special CBI Judge Swarana Kanta Sharma asked media persons present there to vacate the court room during the proceedings.
Bansal had appeared pursuant to the court's fresh summons issued on September 16, when it had made it clear that no exemption from personal appearance would be given to him on the next date.
On the last date of hearing, Bansal had sought exemption on medical grounds.
Bansal was summoned as a prosecution witness in the case in which his nephew Vijay Singla, suspended Railway Board member Mahesh Kumar and eight others are facing trial.
He had not appeared before the court on the last date of hearing and his counsel Puneet Ahluwalia had told the judge that the Congress leader was unwell as he was suffering from viral fever and he would appear on any date after September 19.
Bansal, who resigned in May last year as Railway Minister after the matter came to light, was named as a prosecution witness in the case.
The court had commenced the trial in the case on September 15 in which CBI had charge sheeted 10 accused last year.
The court had on March 11 this year framed charges against all the accused under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC read with provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act.
The court had framed charges against Singla, then Member (Staff) of Railway Board Mahesh Kumar, Managing Director of Bangalore-based G G Tronics India Pvt Limited N R Manjunath, alleged middlemen Ajay Garg and Sandeep Goyal and co-accused Rahul Yadav, Sameer Sandhir, Sushil Daga, C V Venugopal and M V Murali Krishan.
CBI had alleged that Singla had demanded Rs 10 crore from Kumar for his appointment as Member (Electrical) and it was decided between the accused that Rs 5 crore will be paid before the appointment and the rest after the job was done.
It had claimed first tranche of around Rs 90 lakh was given to Singla who was apprehended while accepting the money.
Bansal said that when he had gone to Mumbai for an awards function on April 16 and 17, 2013, he had met Kumar but there was no talk about his appointment as Member (Electrical).
"In the later part of the day on April 17, 2013, I returned to Delhi and he (Kumar) did not meet me in Delhi. As stated earlier, the Chairman, Railway Board had brought the proposal of appointment as Member (Staff) on April 18, 2013 to me personally and I had approved it," he said.
Kumar had met him a third time after his file was cleared for appointment as Member (Staff), Bansal said.
"I told him that I had sent his file for the appointment as Member (staff) and that is the end of it as far as I am concerned," he told the court.
  "Attention of the witness is drawn to the file....Filling up of the post of Member (Staff) Railway Board, and after going through the same, he states that the said file was brought to him by the Chairman, Railway Board, Vinay Mittal himself on April 18, 2013. He signed it and approved the proposal and returned it to Vinay Mittal....there and then," the court noted while referring to Bansal's statement.
"Some clarification is required by senior PP for CBI from the investigating officer (IO) and the IO is out of station. Therefore further examination-in-chief has been deferred," the court said.
During the day's proceeding, it also recorded the statement of another prosecution witness, K A Sivadas, Under Secretary, Cabinet Secretariat, Rashtrapati Bhavan.
The court had on March 11, this year framed charges against 10 accused in the case under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC read with provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act.
It had framed charges against Singla, Mahesh Kumar, Managing Director of Bangalore-based G G Tronics India Pvt Limited N R Manjunath, alleged middlemen Ajay Garg and Sandeep Goyal and co-accused Rahul Yadav, Sameer Sandhir, Sushil Daga, C V Venugopal and M V Murali Krishan.

Shobana Kamineni, Executive Vice Chairperson,  Apollo Hospitals believes the acquisition of Hetero Medical Solutions will help the healthcare major breakeven soon and ramp up quickly. “We expect our margins to improve going ahead,” she told CNBC-TV18’s Ekta Batra and Anuj Singhal.
Below is a verbatim transcript of the interview on CNBC-TV18
Ekta: Apollo Hospitals is set to acquire pharmacy store business of Hetero Medical Solutions. Just wanted more details about this acquisition, could you tell us when it would be completed by, how much is Apollo Hospitals shelling out and how would it be funded?
A: Hetero has stores in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. They have about Rs 320 stores. So we would be doing a process over slum sale and we should be taking it over within three-five months is the time frame. We have actually paid Rs 145 crore that was the deal size subject to the final due diligence. This will be funded by internal accruals.
Anuj: If you could take us through the rational for this acquisition and the kind of synergies?
A: The rational very clearly is that we have a strong presence in these geographies and Hetero has nice stores, location advantages which will help us to expand. It puts us almost twice the size of our nearest competitor and it also gives us a very deep geographical reach specially if you look at Hyderabad we will have something like 500 stores in Telangana itself. So the reach is unprecedented and it will help us move this. So in terms of a rationale to do this, we have an opportunity of increasing. They are already store level breakeven, they are doing half our revenues, we can actually within the next 18 months take it to the levels that the Apollo stores are functioning at just because of better stocking and because of better marketing. So there is a great opportunity for us to ramp up fast and for us to make these stores profitable.
Ekta: What is one of the concerns from the analysts community is that the pharmacy business margins are quite low which is anywhere between 2-3 percent. So in that sense is Hetero working at higher margins and what would that do to the entire financials of the pharmacy segment of Apollo Hospitals, would it put pressure on the margins further or may be push it up higher?
A: I think we will have an opportunity to, in the coming years have higher margins because you are taking out discount a competition and making it more in terms of Apollo. Right now our margins are about 3 percent but our mature stores are above 5 percent. All this will reach to that level. So it is a decent margin for retail and Hetero’s frontend stores are actually not making a loss and by merging it with our much larger backend, we should be able to contain that to a very small loss here.
Anuj: In this organised retail pharmacy space do you see scope for more such acquisitions and to make this space slightly bigger one compared to what it is right now?
A: I think it will be opportunistic. I wouldn’t like to say that there are too many competitors out there that would fit our needs and we are still growing organically. So we are adding another 150 stores this year. We have the capacity to do 300 stores a year so I don’t think unless we really find a good deal like Hetero, they wanted to exit the business, it was a right fit in the geography and the kind of stores, the kind of business mix, everything they have matched us well. So it was a good acquisition. I think we will be able to absorb it very smoothly, that is very important in an acquisition.
Ekta: Would there be any sort of overlap in key markets according to you and hence may be there would be some amount of closure of certain amount of pharmacy outlets simply because you would want to maintain your margins?
A: We mapped it, out of the 320 stores there are 40 stores that are close to ours, so the ones that are touching us, the 15-20 stores that touch us, it is great for us because we get bigger stores. The other 40 that are slightly away and we have been looking for an opportunity to be able to create a new differentiated store possibly for specific disease patterns and do something different. So this is my opportunity. So you will see a new format of stores rolling out from Apollo Pharmacy.
Ekta: Would this bring you a little closer in terms of looking for a strategic partner or may be shelling out some amount of equity in your pharmacy segments, something that the company has spoken about multiple times?
A: I would like to see more clarity from the government on what their stand is on multibrand because we should have a range of options. Right now the only option available for Apollo is probably to do an IPO or to find Indian strategic investors. And I think we are not pressurised. So let us make sure that this is probably the finest retail gem in India so we should be able to take the opportunity and reward the shareholders the maximum at the right time.
Ekta: You all have around Rs 1700 crore in your capex which is lined up at least in the next two years. Would you have any fund raising which would be required for you to fund this capex and your near term capital raising needs?
A: I cannot comment on this. A lot of the spend was already into our business plan, very little is new so it has already been cooked into from internal accruals, what we had our borrowing ability and possibly if required we will do something different.

CBI seeks time to clarify Hindalco closure reportCBI seeks time for clarifications in case against Birla, others

Hindalco Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla (Photo: Reuters)
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday sought more time in a Delhi court to give clarifications on queries posed to it in connection with a closure report filed in coal block allocation case in which an FIR was lodged against top industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla and others.
Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) R S Cheema told Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar that the DIG and SP concerned were not available and therefore, he needed some more time to address the arguments in the matter.
The court allowed the submission of Cheema and posted the matter for hearing on October 13. SPP seeks more time before addressing arguments. Put up the matter for October 13, the judge said. The court was hearing the closure report filed by CBI in its FIR lodged against Birla, former Coal Secretary P C Parakh and others.
On September 12, the court had asked CBI as to what was the hurry in  closing the case in which FIR was registered against Birla, Parakh and  others.
The observation of the court had come after the investigating officer (IO) in the case had contended that the original minutes of meeting of screening committee, in which Birla-owned Hindalco's application seeking allocation of coal blocks was dealt with, were missing.
The agency had told the court that it has already lodged a PE (preliminary enquiry) regarding the missing documents. CBI had on August 28 filed a closure report in the case.
The FIR against Birla , Parakh and others was registered in October last year by CBI which had alleged that Parakh had reversed his decision to reject coal block allocation to Hindalco within months without any valid basis or change in circumstances and shown undue favours.
The FIR relates to allocation of Talabira II and III coal blocks in 2005.
CBI had booked Birla, Parakh and other officials of Hindalco under various IPC sections, including criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct on the part of government officials. In its FIR, the agency had alleged that during the 25th Screening Committee meeting, chaired by Parakh, applications of Hindalco and Indal Industries were rejected for mining in Talabira II and III citing valid reasons.

Is Jadavpur University protest due to banning of drugs and charas: Mamata s nephew and TMC MP AbhishekThe students of Jadavpur University areprotesting in the wake of alleged police assault of students in the early hours of September 17. (Source: PTI/file)

Top 5 mantras to select stocks in a rallying market; see Sensex@30K this year: ExpertAfrica
("IT is in for a big run if the…)
Investors should focus specifically on the 'Modi Model' as infrastructure and manufacturing spaces are bound to do well in the short to long term, says Raghu Kumar , Cofounder of RKSV, in an exclusive interview with Kshitij Anand of EconomicTimes.com . Excerpts:
Q) Give us five stock ideas that you are still recommending to your clients.
Raghu Kumar: We don't give stock-specific tips to our clients. So from a macro perspective, I would focus on:
1) Sectors instead of stocks. Specifically, the 'Modi Model' infra and manufacturing stocks are bound to do well in the short and long term.
2) IT is in for a big run if the rupee continues to falter. Since the elections, most other sectors fared better than IT. IT stocks may be underpriced. Until the rupee appreciates, India's IT sector will continue to fare well since it is in its backbone and outsourcing to IT firms is unlikely to stop.
3) Internet penetration is booming and will continue to boom. Any company directly related to an online-only model is slated to grow.
4) Mobile penetration is a huge hit. Firms taking advantage of a mobile first approach, such as software companies that produce apps or a firm that is mobile friendly, are slated to do well.
5) Finally, look for small cap companies that are going unnoticed and are big on technology. Any firm that recognizes that technology is the wave of the future and has not deserved the attention it deserves is bound to do well. Capitalize on that idea.
Q) Where do you see the Indian markets (Sensex/Nifty) heading in the next 12 months (December and March 2015). How valuations stack up as compared to historic levels?
Raghu Kumar: Since May, I have stood by my forecast of the Sensex hitting 30,000 by the year of 2014. We can expect some slowdown in the markets in the first quarter of 2015 as FII inflows come to a standstill and the US raises its Federal Funds rate. I would expect a quarterly growth of 3-5%, which would pin the Sensex at around 31,500 levels by the end of March and 35,000 levels at the end of 2015.
Q) With Fed uncertainty at bay, does it mean that a new bull run has started for the Indian markets? Even if the Fed does raise rates in 2015, will it have a major impact on the Indian markets?
Raghu Kumar: Absolutely. Anytime the Fed makes any interest rate decision, it is bound to affect emerging markets around the world, especially the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa ).
The reason is quite simple. When the US decides to raise interest rates , it lures investors around the world to shift their funds. The US has kept rates at 0% since 2008. So it would be a dramatic shift in monetary policy .
That being said, the RBI is taking the right approach by taking preventive actions. It has cut its current account deficit by more than half -- from $87.8 billion to $32.4 billion -- through curbs on gold imports and increases in other duties.
With a stable rupee, a growing GDP and a revival in the markets, coupled with the growing US dollar reserves through high FII inflows, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan stated it the best: "My sense is that even when the Fed withdraws, people, after an initial bout of withdrawal, may consider India a good place to leave their money."
India's repo rate is at a high level of 8%, and it would be unwise to assume a drastic rise in the Federal Funds rate.
Q) Despite infusion of liquidity by the government, the worst is still not over for China. On the other hand, India has managed to revive growth and revive manufacturing output. However, CLSA in its recent report said that the Chinese economy will be as big ($21 trillion) as the US economy by 2020. Do you agree?
Raghu Kumar: In terms of GDP, China's latest quarterly GDP reading came in at 7.5%. Despite high credit infusion, weaker domestic investments and a weakened real estate market , there is still a real possibility that the GDP target of 7.5% will be met on an annual basis by the end of 2014.
Even if China does not meet its target, let's take the best case scenario that China maintains a 7.5% GDP growth through the next 6 years. That pins China's GDP at 15 trillion.
Currently, the US GDP sits at 16.8 trillion, and it is unreasonable to assume that it will experience negative GDP. In fact, the forecast is for its GDP to grow at 3% annually. Therefore, it is unlikely for China to become the world's largest economy by 2020.
Q) Everybody wants to 'sell high and buy low'. But does that always work for traders or investors? Is there a way of gauging the right time to buy or sell? If not, what should investors keep in mind while using this strategy?
Raghu Kumar: The rule of thumb is to always try to buy low and sell high. It would never make sense to consciously try to buy high and sell low! That being said, any investor or trader should know when to exit a trade. When to exit a trade is the single most difficult decision an investor or trader encounters.

BSE Sensex, Nifty Struggle Amid Weak Global Cues

The Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
BSE Sensex and Nifty pared some losses in afternoon trade but were still down 0.35 per cent. BSE Sensex had fell 0.65 per cent at its day's low in early trade, tracking weakness in Asian markets.
At 12:45 p.m., the Sensex was down nearly 90 points to 27,001 while Nifty fell 35 points to 8,085.
Strong selling pressure was seen in pharma, IT and capital goods stocks while some buying activity crept into select auto, consumer durables and FMCG stocks.
Market analysts expect Indian markets to remain volatile this week ahead of the derivative expiry on Thursday. "The Nifty is likely to see high volatility as markets have entered the derivatives expiry week. After a sharp bout of short-covering last week, markets are seeing some profit-taking today amid weak global cues," said market analyst Sanjeev Bhasin.
Dhananjay Sinha, head of research at Emkay Global Financial Services, said, "Indian markets are awaiting cues from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US later this month," he added.
However, some buying activity was seen in midcap and smallcap stocks. The BSE midcap index was mildly positive while the smallcap index rose nearly 0.5 per cent.
Among Nifty losers, pharma shares Cipla, Dr Reddy's Lab and Sun Pharma fell between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent.
Other major Nifty losers included DLF, BHEL, IDFC and Asian Paints, down between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent.
Among Nifty gainers, Tata Motors was the biggest Nifty gainer, rising 2.8 per cent.
In global markets, Asian shares skidded on Monday as investors awaited China flash manufacturing PMI data on Tuesday. Major European markets were also lower in early trade today.

Why brick-and-mortar stores tie-up with online retailersArpita Mukherjee      Follow @arpitamukherjee    Last Updated: September 23, 2014  | 11:10 IST
With this tie-up, however, there would be one thing that all the orders would be fulfilled by Croma's distribution centres and delivered using Snapdeal's delivery capabilities.
Croma, a Tata Group-promoted electronics retail chain, has tied up with online marketplace Snapdeal wherein both would sell certain products exclusively at Croma stores and retail those items also on snapdeal.com where Croma has set up an exclusive shop. Croma would also be selling its own products on the portal.
This is a part of working towards an omni-channel strategy, which essentially means retailing through multiple channels such as the web as well as brick-and-mortar stores. Currently, products from other brands include a tablet model by Lenovo and a mobile phone model by Karbonn, which would be sold exclusively by them. "We are in talks and we will have more such deals going ahead," said Ajit Joshi, CEO & MD, Croma, Infiniti Retail, without disclosing other names.
With this tie-up, however, there would be one thing that all the orders would be fulfilled by Croma's distribution centres and delivered using Snapdeal's delivery capabilities. The areas around its existing stores, currently numbering 96 in 16 cities in India, could be catered to by the stores themselves.
A fairly similar announcement was made earlier this month wherein Future Group's Kishore Biyani said the company will invest Rs 100 crore in an e-commerce initiative and will utilise the existing merchandise at its stores, and distribution centres, to fulfil orders that come through from customers.
What brick-and-mortar retailers have been attempting recently tells us how they are considering the use of omni-channel retail for more than just reaching out to a larger customer base. The companies are looking at using their existing warehousing capabilities to ensure efficient distribution of existing merchandise and, in turn, avoid a lot of reverse logistics. Brick-and-mortar retailers are in a way ensuring that their existing inventory can be utilised as well as managed better.
On the one hand, Snapdeal, which connects with 5,000 cities in India, would help increase the reach for Croma. On the other, it would also provide Croma with data and information on which products are working well, along with the geographies where they are working best. The same would happen for Future Group, which would keep getting instant information of the product flow through its online channel.
This would essentially help them manage the supply chain better wherein brands would now be able to replenish inventory faster and much more accurately, rather than getting a chunk of inventory stuck in the pipeline. "The supply chain advantages are far more interesting for a brand," says Snapdeal Co-founder and CEO Kunal Bahl. "It helps them to more appropriately ascertain the demand for a particular product geographically," he adds.
A similar thought was expressed by Future Retail's Joint Managing Director Rakesh Biyani. "I hold inventory in 180 doors today, and all of them do not perform at the same level," says Biyani, talking about the technology being brought in that would enable the company to gauge the demand and replenish accordingly, and also utilise the existing inventory to service demand from the online channel.
Under the online initiative, Big Bazaar would be able to take orders from various parts of the country and fulfil it from its distribution centres, or stores closest to the location. The company currently houses about 160,000 stock keeping units in its stores. However, the one thing that would boost these initiatives immensely is the implementation of the goods and services tax, say both Joshi and Biyani.

Can t file any final report in coal cases: C...Judicial Event
(The court had earlier granted…)
NEW DELHI: The CBI today told a special court that it would not file further final reports for the time being in any coal blocks allocation scam case as the Supreme Court has restrained it from doing so.
Special Public Prosecutor R S Cheema told Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar that the agency was ready with its supplementary final report in the case involving Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Darda and others but there was an embargo of the apex court.
"We cannot file supplementary final report for the time being as there is an embargo of the Supreme Court. So it would not be appropriate to file it," Cheema said.
On being asked by the court if there was a bar on filing supplementary reports also, the prosecutor said the apex court had made an oral observation that the agency should not file any charge sheet or closure report in the coal scam cases until further orders.
The special court was hearing the case in which CBI had named in its charge sheet Vijay Darda, his son Devendra Darda, Manoj Jayaswal, director of Nagpur-based AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd, and the firm as accused for offences under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) read with 420 (cheating) of the IPC and under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
The Supreme Court had on September 19 asked the CBI not to take any final decision on any case arising out of multi-crore coal scam after serious allegations were levelled against its Director Ranjit Sinha for protecting some accused.
The court had earlier granted bail to the three accused after they had appeared before it in pursuance to the summons issued against them.
Vijay Darda, Devendra, Jayaswal and the firm were named as accused in the charge sheet filed by CBI on March 27 in which it had alleged that they had fraudulently acquired the coal blocks. They have denied the allegations levelled against them by CBI.
Regarding AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd, CBI had claimed in its FIR that the firm, in its application form for allocation of coal blocks, had "fraudulently" concealed the fact that its group firms had previously been allocated five coal blocks.
Detailing the allocation of coal blocks to AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd, the agency had said the Ministry of Coal invited applications for allocation of coal blocks, including Bander coal block in Maharashtra having geological reserve of 126.105 million metric tonnes (MMT).
CBI had said that the 36th Screening Committee, which was headed by the Coal Secretary, after concluding its deliberations on July 3, 2008, had recommended allocation of Bander coal block jointly to J K Cement Ltd, M/s Century Textiles and Industries Ltd and AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd for their proposed plants in Karnataka and Maharashtra respectively.

Pakistan appoints army chief's ally Rizwan Akhtar as ISI chief

Army
(Pakistan has appointed…)
ISLAMABAD: Lt Gen Rizwan Akhtar, a close confidante of Pakistan's powerful Army Chief, was today named as the new head of the controversial spy agency ISI, enhancing the military's clout over the embattled government facing protests.
Lt Gen Akhtar was promoted as a three-star general and appointed Director General Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as part of a major reshuffle in the military, a development that would help Army Chief Gen Raheel Sharif in consolidating his powers amid political instability in the country.
"Maj Gens Rizwan Akhtar, Hilal Hussain, Ghayur Mahmood, Nazir Butt, Navid Mukhtar, Hidayat Ur Rehman" were promoted to next ranks, Director General Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major Asim Bajwa tweeted.
Akhtar was appointed as DGISI, Hidayat was posted to Peshawar Corps, Mukhtar to Karachi Corps, Hussain to Mangla Corps, Mahmood to Gujranwala Coprs and Butt was made chief of communication and Information Technology at the Headquarters.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif gave his approval to these postings on the recommendations of General Sharif.
Lt Gen Akhtar will take over from October 1 when the current ISI chief Lt Gen Zaheerul Islam retires along with four other Lieutenant Generals.
Those retiring are Mangla corps commander Lt Gen Tariq Khan, Gujranwala corps commander Lt Gen Saleem Nawaz, Peshawar corps commander Lt Gen Khalid Rabbani and Karachi corps commander Lt Gen Sajjad Ghani.
Technically and legally the ISI chief is appointed by the Prime Minister on the advice of the Army Chief but the former can seldom have his will. Usually the Army Chief sends a name as a formality to the Prime Minister, who has to approve it.
Earlier, it was reported that Maj Gen Naveed Mukhtar was also in the running for the top spy job.
Akhtar is a graduate of the Command and Staff College in Quetta, National Defense University and the Army War College, USA, Dawn News reported.
He is from the Frontier Force Regiment and commanded the infantry brigade and infantry division in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).
Previously as Sindh DG Rangers, Maj Gen Akhtar had been assigned with the task to lead the Karachi operation.
As head of the paramilitary Rangers force in Karachi he launched a major operation against criminal gangs and Taliban militants.
But the military had later replaced him as DG Rangers Sindh with another senior military officer.
Akhtar is also considered to have extensive experience of counter-insurgency from a previous posting in the border region of South Waziristan.
"He has served in a place like Karachi while remaining neutral and apolitical and has extensive experience of counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism. He was the obvious choice," said a serving military official.
"He is a professional soldier who has experience of both FATA and internal security in Karachi," an army official said.
The appointments are expected to help the army consolidate its position amid political turmoil that has weakened Sharif's position.
  Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan and fiery cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri of the Pakistan Awami Tehreek have been protesting against the Nawaz Sharif-led government since August 14, demanding the Prime Minister's ouster.
Khan wants Sharif's resignation over alleged rigging in last year's poll which his party lost, while Qadri wants to bring a revolution in the country.
The appointment comes at a time when army has been accused of instigating unrest in order to weaken Sharif.
Although Pakistan saw its first democratic civilian transfer of power last year, the country has been ruled by the army for much of its history.
The ISI was established in 1948 and became the primary institution running the intelligence operations of the army, air force and navy.
Analysts say that although its precise machinations have remained shadowy, there is little doubt it has played a major role in Pakistan's volatile politics.

1:50 pm Interview: Alibaba IPO that began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Friday saw a stellar opening . The stock opened trade at USD 92.70 per share and rallied upto 38 percent in a single day. The e-commerce company’s strong trading took many by surprise, but is also the reason for Indian online retailers’ cheer. Rohit Bansal, chief executive officer, Snapdeal.com says this IPO validates the belief in emerging market and the fact that online retailers don’t need to own inventory to be successful.
“The response to Alibaba IPO gives confidence to company like ours, but the conventional way of valuations may not work for e-commerce sites as their growth is more than 50 percent at a time when other companies report below 15-20 percent growth,” adds Bansal. Adding to Bansal’s optimism is Henry Guo, senior research analyst, JG Capital who says such companies have huge potential as India continues to see mobile penetration in widespread areas.
1:30 pm Buzzing: Investors continued to sell shares of Bharti Infratel Monday on media reports that the shareholder Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Company (KKR) may sell its entire 2.38 percent equity stake (or 4.5 crore equity shares) soon. The stock lost more than 4 percent intraday. "American private equity fund KKR is set to launch a share sale that could raise about USD 230 million as it exits Bharti Infratel six years after investing, taking advantage of a sharp rebound in the valuations of the telecom tower company," said a media report quoting unnamed sources, adding the share sale will be via block trades on the stock exchanges.
In India, the company has over 35,000 towers, across 18 states, and 11 telecom circles. It also has a 42 percent stake in Indus Towers which was created as a joint venture between Bharti Infratel, Vodafone and Aditya Birla Telecom to hive off the towers business in 15 telecom circles.

Silver's sell-off extended to a second session on Monday, with the metal tumbling to a four-year low, as investors unwound long positions amid strength in the dollar and the possibility of a sooner-than-expected U.S. rate hike.
Weakness in gold, which fell to its lowest since January and was edging close to breaking below USD 1,200 an ounce, also weighed on silver and other precious metals. The precious metals group has seen sharp losses in recent days as the dollar index hit a four-year high last week on expectations the world's biggest economy will see the start of its rate-tightening cycle sooner-than-expected.

Sensex wipes off early losses; Consumer durables  auto stocks vroomSensex up 116 points; consumer durables, FMCG stocks steal the show
Our Bureau/Agencies
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the green amid weak European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex rose 116.32 points or 0.43 per cent at 27,206.74 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty gained 24.85 points or 0.31 per cent at 8,146.30.
Rajesh Agarwal, Head-Research, Eastern Financiers, in a report said: "Going forward, the Sensex earnings multiple at 17 times FY15 earnings looks a bit stretched, and investors would be better off being cautious as the near term upside looks a little difficult. Some reforms have taken place but the quantum of impact on the bottom-line of corporates needs to be seen. Hot money, lower crude prices, monsoon not turning out to be as bad as was earlier expected, are some of the factors that are driving the markets. While we believe that markets could witness correction in short-term, earnings expansion, government initiatives towards infrastructure and strengthening economic data, provide comfort on the medium-term. We strongly believe that the Government’s pro-growth approach will aid the revival in the economy and would in turn boost equity markets."
Among BSE sectoral indices, consumer durables, FMCG, auto and oil & gas indices were the star-performers and were up 3.12 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.88 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, metal index fell the most by 1.22 per cent, followed by healthcare 0.89 per cent and India infrastructure 0.87 per cent.
Tata Motors, ONGC, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and SBIN were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Cipla, BHEL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Infosys.
Concerns over a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday, while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners' shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 per cent, also took its toll.
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the weekend said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 347.48 at 10:02 a.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.6 per cent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts slid 0.5 per cent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.8 per cent.

Monsanto India sees Indian biz growing 3 times of current size in next three years.Suprotip Ghosh      Follow @suprotip    Last Updated: September 23, 2014  | 11:11 IST
Monsanto India CEO Shilpa Divekar Nirula
Shilpa Divekar Nirula took over the mantle of CEO at Monsanto India last month. Passionate about agriculture, Nirula is presiding over a company that is transforming from just being a seeds and biotechnology company into one which will provide farmers with services including weather information, farming and seed support. In her first interview after becoming CEO, she tells Suprotip Ghosh about Monsanto's plans.
 
Q- What are the plans for Monsanto in India in the medium to long term?
A- We are transforming into a solutions company. This means that here's my farmer; I will look at one of the needs of my farmer, I may not be the sole provider of those needs. As a company, Monsanto will provide some aspect of those solutions including agronomic advice. But then how do we partner and collaborate with a whole host of others, so that if we can address a farmer, we sort of give the correct inputs collectively so that he can achieve his objectives. This is directionally where we look to go as a company.
 
Q- So from a biotechnology company you are going to become a solutions and services company?
A- We already have one million farmers with whom we have been working. We will reach out to them. There is the issue of reading and language skills, we don't want to lose out on farmers who may not necessarily be able to read very fluently. It is very fascinating in terms of what is possible.
 
Q- In the next three to five years, what are the concrete goals you have in mind?
A- There are three or four spaces. Very clearly, we will continue to focus on our core, which is very clearly our seed business - cotton, corn and vegetables. We do a lot of R&D, which is focussed on developing germplasm, which is the seed required for Indian conditions. India has seven to eight different agronomic zones, and each of those has different climatic conditions, soil patterns, farmers are different, so they tend to differ. So how can we continue to  develop the seed that are needed. The third area will be the whole services space. How we can evolve to become a solutions company to the farmers. As we go ahead, we will seek to partner with various companies who are participating  in agriculture in very different ways.  It could  be a weather services company, for example. There may be opportunities to combine some of the opportunities with insurance - farmers are exposed to a lot of weather risk, for instance, and we are very open to collaboration  and partnerships.
 
Q- Would you consider collaborating with insurance companies?
A- We are open to collaboration and partnerships and it has played out quite well in the cotton technology business. And that will form the central pillar of what we will do in the country.
 
Q- What kind of growth targets do you have?
A- Like every company we have our cycles of what we can achieve and therefore plan. I think we could over the next five years look at growing the Indian business at least three times the current size. That is only possible if we bring what is the most relevant to the Indian farmer. And we are completely focussed on that.
 
Q- Can you be more specific as to which areas these are?
A- Water is a huge challenge in the country; agriculture is the biggest user of water, and many parts of India are already below the threshold of how much the water table has shrunk, for example. That's another area of focus as we develop our seeds for Indian conditions. As we work in partnerships  along with state governments. We would like to work on how farmers would do agriculture more sustainably. A day will come when it might be impossible to grow anything on that land. It doesn't end without tying up the whole chain together. But if you want to talk to farmers and say ok, you are growing a crop which is using a lot of water, and I want you to switch to something else, as a government, or a state government, he would say, who's going to buy my produce? That is the biggest concern - that today I am growing a crop and someone's going to come and buy my produce. Tomorrow I may grow a crop and no one might be interested. So we are increasingly thinking about how can we actually bring those linkages. A big area of opportunity is to see how this can become a more integrated chain. A seed company, starting with the farmer from the seed it will plant to the output and seeing who needs that output. It isn't really easy in the first year, but you will have to hang on in there.
 
Q- Does this mean, for instance, there will be ketchup companies setting up factories in places where there is tomato produced?
A- I think there will be people seeking to find a place where they can create established capacity, so that the produce is available closer. If you look at corn today, it is all over, and there is a lot of quality degradation as it is transported over long distances. We see more and more capacity coming up in starch, or poultry and there is a real opportunity to build these in the hubs where some of the actual production is happening so that the time it needs to travel to get to the point where it is going to get processed reduces.
Q- You mentioned getting closer to the farmer. How do you want to achieve that in terms of the services play?
A- There is an opportunity to get more information out to our farmers. So that they can use the resources that they have to get far better yields or say costs. I think there is an opportunity there. I think farming is the riskiest profession in the country today. You saw what has happened in the monsoon and the peak planting season. It causes a lot of angst among farmers because it will decide on whether they would earn any money which will last them the rest of the year. Crop insurance in the country is very limited, it is largely linked to loans so there is always an insurance cover. Weather insurance penetration to the so-called non-loanee farmers is less than four per cent. This element of 'secure' has a lot of opportunity.
 
Q- What is the workaround for water problems?
A- We are working on drought-tolerant seeds. Depending on where it is in the various stages of R&D, we will bring it to market.

New iPhones are more durable than Samsung GalaxyS5Apple's latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are more durable than the iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy S5.
Associated Press | Posted: September 22, 2014 2:20 pm
 
Apple’s new and bigger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are more durable than last year’s model and a leading Android phone, a study says.
Apple’s iPhone 6, whose screen measures 4.7 inches (11.9 centimeters), did the best across a variety of tests that measures how prone smartphones are to break due to every day accidents, SquareTrade, a company that provides extended protection plans, says.
The iPhone Plus 6, whose screen measures 5.5 inches (14 centimeters), wasn’t far behind but lost points because it could slip out of a person’s hand since some users may have a hard time gripping its large but slim form, SquareTrade says.
The iPhone 5s, which measures 4 inches (10 centimeters) and came out last year, fared better than Samsung’s Galaxy S5, which measures 5.1 inches (12.95 centimeters). The Samsung phone got poor marks on several tests including the slide test. The more a phone slides, the greater its chance of falling off the edge of a table.
Still, all four of the smartphones tested had a medium risk of breakage and had no drastic differences among them.
”The phones are getting more and more durable,” says Ty Shay, chief marketing officer at SquareTrade. ”Manufacturers are paying more attention.”
SquareTrade examines the phones based on eight factors, including size, weight, grip and the quality of the front and back panels. The company measured how far the phones slide when pushed across a table on their backs and how well they withstand drops from 4 feet (1.2 meters) and being dunked in water for 10 seconds.
SquareTrade says it uses robots to do the testing to ensure consistency, and rates the phones on a 10-point durability scale, with 10 signifying the highest risk. Apple’s iPhone 6 scored the best at 4; the iPhone 6 Plus scored a 5; the iPhone 5s a 6; and Samsung Galaxy S5 a 6.5.
Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus passed the slide test, but the iPhone 5s and Samsung Galaxy’s S5 got poor marks in that area. The iPhone 6 Plus was the only one that didn’t fare as well when dropped 4 feet (1.2 meters) by the robot. The glass screen survived, but the case separated from the glass. All four phones fared well in the water resistance test.
SquareTrade provided The Associated Press with the results ahead of Monday’s announcement.
Aside from larger screens, the new Apple iPhones 6 and 6 Plus announced this month promises faster performance and offers a wireless chip for making credit card payments at stores by holding the phone near the payment terminal. The phones start at $199 with a two-year service contact. The phones went on sale this past week in the U.S. and nine other countries.

Amid seat-sharing tussle  Sena backs Modi for praisingMuslimsThe party, however, said Modi's praise of patriotism of Indian Muslims should not be seen as a dilution of his commitment to Hindutva. (Source: Reuters/file)
Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: September 22, 2014 2:18 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 2:24 pm
Even as its alliance with BJP appeared teetering on the brink, Shiv Sena on Monday endorsed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s praise for Indian Muslims, saying he has “initiated a new chapter by giving a guarantee of the community’s love for its motherland”.
“Modi has lauded Indian Muslims for their patriotism. He has initiated a new chapter by giving a guarantee of the community’s love for its motherland. Now, Muslims must not let him down,” an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana” said.
The party, an ally of BJP for 25 years, however, said Modi’s praise of patriotism of Indian Muslims should not be seen as a dilution of his commitment to Hindutva.
“There is no reason to believe that Hindutva in Modi’s mind has been diluted just because he called Muslims patriotic,” the editorial said.
Asking Muslims not to let Modi down after he had shown immense faith in them, the Sena said, “As a Prime Minister, Modi represents people from all communities and there is no reason why he should be against a particular community. But, he has been always painted as ‘anti-Muslim’ by pseudo-secularists of the country.”
If some people are involved in terrorism, it doesn’t  mean that every Muslim should be painted as a terrorist, the Sena mouthpiece said.
In an interview to a TV channel, Modi had said Indian  Muslims will live and die for India and not dance to the tune of terrorist organisations like al Qaeda.
Shiv Sena’s approval of Modi’s remarks on Muslims, despite its hardline Hindutva ideology, could be seen as an attempt to keep the Prime Minister in good humour amid the continuing stand-off over seat-sharing for the Maharashtra Assembly polls next month.
Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had yesterday made a  “final offer” to its long-standing ally, saying while Shiv Sena would contest 151 seats, BJP 119 and the rest 18 would go to smaller allies in the 288-member Assembly. BJP had promptly rejected the offer.

Arihant capital neutral on Coal India; target of Rs 355
Arihant capital markets has recommended a neutral rating on Coal India with a target price of Rs 355, in its research report dated September 19, 2014.
Post your opinion here
 
Arihant capital markets' research report on Coal India
"Coal India is the largest coal producer in the world with the production of 462 MT in FY14 and the reserves of 80.9 BT. CIL accounts for approx 80 % of the total coal produced in India and virtually enjoys the monopoly in the domestic market. Although CIL sells coal at about 50 % discount to international prices, it has healthy EBIDTA margins of more than 20%. Due to its size, CIL realises economies of scale in production, procurement and sales. Almost 75% of the CIL dispatches are to the thermal power sector in India. The relatively low per capita power consumption in India compared to world average and the continuing power deficit in India presents significant potential for growth in the demand for power in India, and thus demand for non-coking coal."
"CIL has a very strong balance sheet with net cash in excess of Rs 80 per share which gives it the cash chest required to buy mines and augment resources. CIL has been able to deliver continuous growth in its EBITDA per ton of coal sold and Net profit per ton thus adding to its cash reserves."
Valuation: "Coal India is currently trading at a PE of 10.8x FY16E EPS of Rs 32.1.We have arrived at the price target of Rs 385 based on 12x FY16E EPS (Market is currently trading at this multiple). Using DCF model we have arrived at a price target of Rs 325. Consequently, using the weighted average methodology we arrive at a share price of Rs 355, having 2% of potential upside from current price of Rs 346. We initiate coverage with NEUTRAL rating on the stock", says Arihant capital markets research report.

Spending: Cash out your lease0
To pull the profit out of the car yourself, you'll need to know what your vehicle is worth. Look at a site that lists used-car values, such as Kelley Blue Book ( http://www.kbb.com ), NADA Guides ( http://www.nadaguides.com ) or Edmunds.com, for the dealer retail price. Then call your leasing company and find out what your current payoff amount is, including the remaining payments, the cost to buy the car and the termination fee (a few hundred dollars).
If your payoff is less than what the car is worth, it makes sense to sell it. A dealer or CarMax can appraise the car, contact the leasing company for the payoff quote and write you a check for the difference. If you'd rather try your hand at boosting your profit by selling the car to an individual, LeaseCompare.com will handle the paperwork for $495 so the title transfers directly to the new owner and sales tax is paid only once.
If you wait until the end of the lease and turn the car in, be prepared to pay some fees. You'll pay a disposition fee of $200 to $500 to cover the cost for the leasing company to clean up the car, prepare it for sale and handle the paperwork. If you've gone over the mileage allotment, you'll pay about 20 cents per extra mile.
If the car has a few scratches, you probably won't be charged for excess wear and tear. But get anything more serious fixed before you turn the car in. It will likely be cheaper to pay for the fixes yourself than to be billed for the damage later.
Don't dismiss the option of buying the car at the end of the lease and keeping it, even if comparable vehicles are selling for less than the lease's purchase price. You'll pay a purchase option fee of $200 to $500, but the peace of mind of knowing the car's history may be worth the extra cost.

Nepal clears GMR plan for hydroelectric plantNepal clears GMR plan for $1.4 bn hydroelectric plant
Reuters     Kathmandu   Last Updated: September 20, 2014  | 15:02 IST
Picture for representation purpose . Photo: Reuters.
Nepal's Cabinet has cleared the way for Indian firm GMR to build a $1.4 billion hydroelectric plant in the northwest of the country, a cabinet minister said, the Himalayan republic's biggest foreign investment scheme.
The Nepalese government agreed to allow GMR in 2008 to construct the 900-megawatt Upper Karnali hydroelectric power plant in the northwest.
Law Minister Narahari Acharya said a Cabinet meeting had approved the draft of an agreement to be signed with the Indian company.
"This approval will open the way for different foreign investment projects that are in the pipeline to move ahead," Acharya told Reuters after a Cabinet meeting.
Officials said GMR and another Indian firm, Satluj Vidyut Nigam, plan to construct other hydroelectric plants in Nepal with a potential to generate up to 42,000 megawatts of electricity.
The GMR plant, set for completion in 2021, will provide 12 per cent energy free to Nepal to ease a crippling power shortage.
Officials said Investment Board Nepal will now sign a Project Development Agreement (PDA) with GMR, which will construct transmission lines across the border to transmit the remaining electricity to India.
The Indian firm will give a 27 per cent stake in the plant to Nepal.

Only 1 in 5 Start-ups Gives Good ReturnsManufacturing Growth May Moderate in December Quarter: Industry Body
New Delhi: India has witnessed a boom in the e-commerce/start-up sector in last five years but only one out of five start-ups gives good returns, while three do not give any return or simply fold up, according to experts.
Moreover, as the focus has now shifted to developing and encouraging more start-ups, there is a definite chance that many start-ups and .coms would find it difficult to flourish amid tough competition from already established ones.
"The excitement around e-commerce is real but the valuations may be a bubble," The Chennai Angels member Kayar Raghavan said, adding, "One out of five start-ups gives good returns while three do not give any return or simply fold up."
Experts believe that with all these major players who are already operational and making profits, smaller set-ups find it tough to gain second round of funding or hard to continue further after the funding. Between 2012 and 2014 alone, there have been many start-ups shutting shop.
"Exits" for initial investors are difficult to come by not just in India but across the world.
Sometimes, earlier investors get to exit partially or fully at subsequent fund-raising rounds. Another form of exit happens through consolidation/M&A. IPO is the other preferred route.
Mr Raghavan noted that investors to the start-ups get few exits but when one does indeed get an exit through whatever means (secondary or M&A), that is highly likely to be only profitable.
"Redbus, Snapdeal, Myntra, Flipkart, Mu Sigma, JustDial, LetsBuy, makeMyTrip, Chakpak, Rediff, etc, are examples although a couple of these may have made money for only early investors," he added.
Another member of The Chennai Angels Mithun Sacheti said "exits are not always profitable".
"Exit in itself means a return on capital, which would be positive or negative. But it is better than having no option to exit and being a part of a living dead company."

("The intention is to launch…)
NEW DELHI: Bharti Infratel Ltd slipped upto 5 per cent in trade on Monday, after the US private equity fund Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. (KKR) is set to launch a share sale that could raise about $230 million as it exits Bharti Infratel six years after investing, taking advantage of a sharp rebound in the valuations of the telecom tower company.
At 09:25 a.m.; Bharti Infratel was trading 2 per cent lower at Rs 303.15. It hit a low of Rs 299.50 and a high of Rs 311.50 in trade today.
"It will be via block trades on the stock exchanges. KKR has already called for pitches from investment banks such as Morgan Stanley , UBS and Citigroup," ET reported quoting a person with direct knowledge of the development said.
"The intention is to launch it (the share sale) this week, but depends on a lot of variables, so it's not set in stone."
Bharti Infratel is run by India's largest phone company by revenue, Bharti Airtel. KKR and Bharti Infratel declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, UBS and Citigroup didn't respond to calls.
KKR owns 4.5 crore shares , or 2.38%, of Bharti Infratel, which has more than 36,000 telecom towers of its own. In addition, Bharti Infratel has a 42% holding in Indus Towers , the country's largest telecom tower company that's owned jointly by Vodafone India , Idea and Bharti Airtel , said the ET report.
Since its IPO price of Rs220 in December 2012, Bharti Infratel's stock plunged to an all-time low of Rs148 in June 2013, mirroring the troubles in the telecom industry, and consequently the tower companies.

In first Indian tech buyout  Yahoo! acquires Bookpad for Rs 50 croreEyeing buyouts, global majors scout Indian start-up world
Itika Sharma Punit | Bangalore Sep 23, 2014 12:58 AM IST
Acquisition of Indian software product start-ups by Facebook, Google and Yahoo! over recent months might just be the tipping point for Indian entrepreneurs. According to several sources, Walmart, Target, Microsoft, Thomson Reuters and Goldman Sachs are among those looking for suitable matches.
Retail giants are looking at Indian start-ups in the big data and analytics space and several start-ups with machine learning and financial tools are being evaluated by others.
The heightened interest in Indian start-ups among multinational companies was evident last week when Google Senior Vice-President Sundar Pichai attended a roundtable organised by Nasscom to showcase some start-ups. “There were eight companies that met Pichai at the roundtable,” said a person who was present but did not wish to be named. “The companies that met Pichai were related to his interest, Android and applications.”
GIVING IT A GOOD START
Walmart, Target, Microsoft, Thomson Reuters and Goldman Sachs are said to be eying Indian start-ups
Big data, analytics, machine learning, financial tools hot areas for acquisition
Google’s Sundar Pichai met eight start-ups at a private roundtable in Delhi last week
Nasscom may showcase a few start-ups for Microsoft’s Nadella in Delhi next week
At least 30 global majors have screened potential targets at Nasscom warehouse in the past year
Nasscom is also looking to organise a similar roundtable for Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who is scheduled to visit India later this month.
The interest was triggered by technology majors, which led in acquisitions here. Social networking major Facebook acquired Bangalore-based Little Eye Labs in a $10-15 million deal this January. The same month, Google acquired cyber security firm Impermium, co-founded by Vishwanath Ramarao, Naveen Jamal and Mark Risher, for an undisclosed amount.
More recently, internet major Yahoo! acquired Bookpad, a Bangalore-based start-up, for Rs 50 crore. While it has not yet made an official announcement, this will be Yahoo!'s first technology buyout in the country.
"Triggered by some recent acquisitions, there is a concerted effort by large global companies to look at the Indian start-up ecosystem," said an executive in the investment arm of a multinational company who did not wish to be named. "Until a year ago, global companies were not even aware that such solutions were available in India. But with Facebook and Google having made some investments, interest is much higher."
Several global majors are engaging with industry bodies like Nasscom and iSpirt, to reach the right start-ups. This arrangement works for the start-ups, many of which cannot afford investment bankers. The Nasscom warehouse in Bangalore, where the industry body incubates start-ups, has been visited by at least 30 global majors to screen potential acquisition targets over the past year.
ISpirt, which has been working to facilitate mergers and acquisitions (M&As) for Indian software product companies, held a second roundtable at Palo Alto, California, in February to showcase Indian start-ups to acquirers in Silicon Valley. The roundtable, which was also aimed at understanding the requirements of companies when they look at M&As, was attended by corporate development and other senior executives from Google, Microsoft, Intel, Qualcomm, Groupon, VMWare, Intuit, Box, Cadence, Docomo and LG.
“A year ago if I asked a multinationals based out of the US to visit India and look at the work being done by software product start-ups, they would ask me why should they come down to a place that took two days to reach. Nothing much was known about the ecosystem,” said Ravi Gururaj, chairman of Nasscom’s product council. “But the few deals that have happened this year have increased the visibility for Indian software products. And, people are now curious to see what we are doing.”

Chennai: Cruising towards its historic rendezvous with the red planet, India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) on Monday entered the Mars Gravitational Sphere of Influence ahead of its scheduled Orbit Insertion on September 24.
"Our navigators' calculations show that MOM has entered the Gravitational Sphere of Influence of Mars," ISRO said on its social networking site, adding, the spacecraft was within 5.4 lakh km radius of the Mars' Gravitational Sphere of Influence.
After being launched from ISRO's spaceport of Sriharikota on November 5, 2013, the MOM had left Earth's orbit on December 1 and began its historic voyage to put India on the list of elite nations, which has sent a mission to Mars.
The crucial fourth trajectory correction manoeuvre and test fire of the main liquid engine on the spacecraft is scheduled for 2:30 PM on Monday.

"MOM has entered the Mars Gravitational Sphere of Influence this morning and we will perform certain procedures on the mission today. The fourth trajectory correction manoeuvre and test firing of Main Liquid Engine will be test fired for 3.968 seconds," an ISRO official said.
Now that the spacecraft has entered the Mars' influence, its velocity has to be controlled so that it does not escape the Mars' influence, he said, adding, the spacecraft is scheduled to enter the Mars Orbit Insertion at 7:30 AM IST on September 24.
The crucial fourth trajectory correction manoeuvre and test fire of the main liquid engine on the spacecraft is scheduled for 2:30 PM on Monday.
The MOM, India's first interplanetary mission, was launched by India's workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle from the spaceport of Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.

As China looks to step up its investments in India after President Xi Jinping's first visit, India is wooing major Chinese financial institutions like the sovereign wealth funds, which can potentially invest billions of dollars in the lucrative Indian stock market.
"If you look at the Asia story, economies like India are definitely a significant piece of economic growth in this entire sub-continent. It makes a lot of rational  sense for them to think about India," Chitra Ramkrishna, the MD and CEO of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), said making a case for Chinese firms to begin investing in Indian stock markets.
A lot of bilateral discussions have taken place between the two countries in this regard, she said. One of the bilateral meetings she had was with the Shenzhen stock exchange President and CEO Liping Song.
"We are working with the Chinese specifically to see if there are any road blocks. Prima-facie the whole Foreign institutional framework in India is very welcoming," Chitra told PTI in an interview. Chitra was here on a visit to attend a key conference in which she spoke on the 'role of stock exchanges in China's financial reform'.
She was replying to a question on whether China is getting interested to explore opportunities to allow big sovereign wealth funds like the China Investment Corporation (CIC) which is sitting on a corpus of over USD 650 billion to invest in India.
"It is beginning to happen especially with high-level dialogue between the two countries. The high-level dialogue always triggers more broad based interest in countries. This will start to happen," she said, replying to a question about prospects of Chinese investments in Indian stock markets which showed signs of bouncing back in recent months.
During the just concluded visit of Xi to India, China has committed to invest USD 20 billion in two industrial parks as well as in the modernisation of Indian Railways.
"In terms of India's growth story and the new set of economic growth parameters set out by the new government, the appetite for new investment is tremendous," she said. "The kind of returns the Indian markets can offer is always on the upper quartile compared to most destinations in Asia. So it is a good diversification for Chinese investments to think about investments in India," she said.

Railgate: Ex-Railway Minister Pawan Kuma Bansal appears as witnessPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:53 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 2:47 pm
Bansal, who resigned in May last year as Railway Minister after the matter came to light, was named as a prosecution witness in the case.
Former Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal Monday appeared in a Delhi court to depose as a prosecution witness in the Rs 10 crore cash-for-post railway bribery case in which his nephew is also an accused.
Prior to recording his statement Special CBI Judge Swarana Kanta Sharma asked media persons present there to vacate the court room during the proceedings.

Bansal was summoned as a prosecution witness in the case in which his nephew Vijay Singla, suspended Railway Board member Mahesh Kumar and eight others are facing trial.
He had not appeared before the court on the last date of hearing and his counsel Puneet Ahluwalia had told the judge that the Congress leader was unwell as he was suffering from viral fever and he would appear on any date after September 19.
Bansal, who resigned in May last year as Railway Minister after the matter came to light, was named as a prosecution witness in the case.

It had claimed first tranche of around Rs 90 lakh was given to Singla who was apprehended while accepting the money.

(KTG is in the process of adding…)
MUMBAI: Kochi-based Kitex Garments (KTG) has rallied 20 per cent in trade after Motilal Oswal initiated coverage with a 'Buy' recommendation.
According to the brokerage, the company has diversified its clients mix from a single client in FY09 to five currently, reducing client concentration risk and improving margins.
KTG is in the process of adding some large clients in FY15 apart from deepening business with existing clients like Gerber, Toys R Us , Jockey, Mothercare and Carter's.
The company is in the business of manufacturing and exporting infant garments. It derives 85 per cent of its revenue from the sale of infant garments and the balance 15 per cent from the sale of fabric to Kitex Childrenwear.
"Going forward, KTG intends to improve its revenue mix in favor of high margin clients like Toys R Us, Jockey and Mothercare, who procure high value-added products which will drive continued margin improvement," the report said.
"We expect KTG to post 24.6 per cent revenue CAGR coupled with 700bp margin expansion over FY14-FY17E. Hence, we expect PAT to post 40 per cent CAGR over FY14-17E. With 60 per cent capacity utilization currently, we expect ramp-up of existing capacities and minimal expansion capex," the report said.
"Given strong balance sheet and significant free cash flows, RoCE and RoE should improve from ~37 per cent and 39 per cent respectively to ~58 per cent and 39 per cent over FY14-17E. At CMP, the stock trades at 24.5x FY15E, 16.6x FY16E and 12.4x FY17E EPS," the report added.
Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage with a 'Buy' rating with a target price of Rs 615, an upside of 50 per cent, from its last closing price of Rs 410.

Domestic biz to contribute 40% of rev by 2020: ADF FoodsWe will be rolling out close to 30-40 new products in the next 12 months.
Bimal Thakkar

ADF Foods
Manufacturers of Indian pickles, chutneys, frozen foods, masalas, spices, ready-to-eat foods,  ADF Foods has re-entered the domestic market after 10 years. Bimal Thakkar, Managing Director, ADF Foods expects the domestic business to contribute an ambitious 40 percent of revenue by 2020.
The company plans to invest Rs 100 crore in domestic business in the next five years and targets revenue of Rs 1,000 crore by 2020. It sees FY15 revenue at Rs 250 crore and plans to break-even in FY15. Thakkar also expects to see a turnaround in EBITDA margin from FY15. EBITDA margins expected to return to 15 percent in the next five years.
Also Read: ADF Foods promoters plan to raise holding in co to 60%: MD
The company also plans to expand its export business and introduce more distributors in the US and Europe.
He expects the US subsidiary to grow by 30-40 percent this fiscal year. The company is also exploring inorganic opportunities in the US.
He says the India-based business is still in the investment mode and hence loss-making.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Bimal Thakkar's interview with Sumaira Abidi and Reema Tendulkar on CNBC-TV18.
Reema: Could you start by talking about your India plans, your focus on domestic business currently, what is the growth rate in India, how much more are you targeting, the kind of investments that you are looking to make?
A: Our company has very ambitious plans charted out for the domestic market. We have re-entered the domestic market after about 10 years and we feel very optimistic about the growth in the domestic market.
We have launched a brand, Soul. Soul is our umbrella brand for the domestic market where we have got a lot of exciting products planned out. We will be rolling out close to 30-40 new products in the next 12 months.
Currently the domestic business is about 10 percent of our revenues and in the next five years we expect it to be around 40 percent of our total revenues. We have close to Rs 100 crore lined up for over the next four to five years on sales and distribution and advertising spends.
Reema: You want domestic business to be 40 percent of your revenues in how many years?
A: In the next five years. So, by 2020 we expect the domestic to be around 40 percent of our revenues.
Sumaira: I have already seen your brand on many of the shelves in the supermarkets, I have already sampled it as well but there is a lot of competitive intensity in this sector. What kind of a market share do you currently have; I understand right now it is a very small segment for you and what kind of market share are you targeting?
A: What we want to do is the whole brand proposition for Soul is we want to give healthy and good for you products to our consumers. All our products which we introduce, there is always going to be a product differentiation in terms of the product recipe or in terms of packaging innovation.
We will play in the large categories, so, we will be in the snacks space, we will be in spice and masala space but within these large categories what we want to create for ourselves is a niche in itself which itself will be a very big revenue. So, by 2020 we are targeting about Rs 400 crore revenue for the domestic market and that is what our plan is.
Reema: Could you also give us your 2020 plan for your overall consolidated business? Will it be close to about Rs 1000 crore doing the math?
A: Yes, that is what the plan is.
Reema: Can we talk a little more about your exports business. You’ll also had three years back acquired a company in the US which you’ll call ADF Foods US. What is the outlook over there if you could highlight what the revenue as well as the margin performance will be for ADF Foods USA?
A: ADF Foods USA currently is in the organic and natural food space in America. So, we do organic Mexican food and we have a lot of other natural foods as well and that whole category and space in the US is currently having a lot of traction and high growth in that area.
We bought this business, it was a loss making business and this year we expect the business to grow by 30 percent. Going forward again we are looking at, at least 30-40 percent growth figures and we are also aggressively looking for inorganic growth in the US.
Sumaira: On your margin front in this quarter you have already managed to scale up your OPMs to above that 12 percent mark. How much higher could it go, what is a sustainable run rate for you?
A: The first quarter has been very good for us and the next three quarters also we expect the margins to be good. However, you have to understand that our India business is in an investment mode and will be for the next three to four years. So, our core business which is our international business, that gives us very decent margins, upwards of 20 percent EBITDA and that will continue to be our cash cow and that continues to grow for us at a good 15-20 percent. However, domestic is where we will be looking at investments over the next four years. So, it will be three to four years before domestic starts contributing to the bottomline.
Reema: You spoke about considering inorganic opportunities in the US. Are you currently in negotiation with any company and will you close a transaction in this fiscal year itself and coming back to the India business, is the India business loss making considering that is in investment phase and if yes what will be the extent of losses for the India business?
A: We are constantly evaluating offers which keep coming to us, so, there are some offers which we are evaluating. I don’t know when that would fructify into a transaction.
As far as the second question goes, India will be in an investment mode and hence it is loss making. The advertising and sales and distribution expense is primarily what our losses would be. So, that would continue for the next three to four years.
Sumaira: We also understand that the promoters have been increasing their stake, in this year they have already increased it by almost 4.2 percent. Would you know if the plan is to take it all the way to that 5 percent mark and what has been the rationale?
A: We would like to do that and we will try and continue doing this as per the creeping acquisition guidelines. So, our plan is to try and increase and consolidate our holding.
Reema: What would be the target holding that the promoters are looking to have in the company?
A: We would like to see ourselves at 60 percent if possible.

PIA crew detained for smuggling iPhonesPress Trust of India | Lahore | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:27 pm
Most of the cabin crew of a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight were detained by customs authorities at the airport here for allegedly smuggling 24 iPhones worth about Rs 2.5 million and also foreign currency.
The incident yesterday caused panic at the airport, besides delaying a Manchester-bound PIA flight for a couple of hours, after the crew staged a sit-in against the detention of their colleagues.
The customs authorities had information that 11 of the 14 crew members of PK-758 flight, including the captain and a purser, brought over 20 iPhones-5S (worth over Rs 105,000 each) from London on Friday during its launch, Dawn reported.
“The accused are office-bearers of the PIA staff union (CBA) and they did it under a plan. They first managed to get their duties changed by requesting the actual crew members for the flight in connivance with the relevant admin staff,” Dawn quoted a senior PIA official as saying.
He said the accused left for London to purchase iPhones at cheap rates to sell them in Pakistan at higher prices.
He said some of their rivals in the union informed the customs officials about the plan before their return.
“As soon as the crew members reported in the lounge after landing of the plane, the authorities searched them. But they did not find iPhones. Later, they learnt that the accused had handed over the phones to a passenger,” the official said.
The phones were later recovered from the passenger.
The authorities also reportedly recovered 5,000 British pounds from the captain and some other crew.
The official said then the accused called their fellow crew members who were about to depart for Manchester.
The crew members, along with some other union staff, staged a sit-in and chanted slogans against the authorities for harassing them.
The protests ended after the detained crew members were released.
A PIA spokesman said an inquiry had been launched.
“Since it is a serious matter, an inquiry is under way. We will be able to tell who is responsible for the incident after the inquiry,” the spokesman said.

2G: SC turns down plea of CBI director Ranjit Sinha on case against him2G
("The view of SPP has to be…)
NEW DELHI: In a setback to CBI Director Ranjit Sinha , the Supreme Court today agreed to consider a plea for hearing allegations levelled against him without knowing the name of the whistleblower in a case relating to controversial entries in the visitors' diary at his residence.
A bench headed by Justice H L Dattu sought the assistance of the Special Public Prosecutor(SPP), appointed by it for trial in 2G cases, saying that any order passed by it may have ramifications on multi-crore scam cases.
The bench agreed to hear the plea of NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation which pleaded for recall of its earlier order asking it to reveal the name of the whistleblower in a sealed envelope.
It turned down the plea of the CBI Director's counsel Vikas Singh that the apex court should not hear the case any further in view of the NGO refusing to disclose the name of "mole" who leaked the documents, including CBI file notings and the register.
"No, no. We are sorry Mr Vikas," the bench said when the CBI counsel pleaded that no order should be passed and he should be heard before passing any direction.
Submitting that there has been no interference on his part in any of the cases probed by CBI, Sinha pleaded that continuance of this case even for a single day would cause more public harm and would affect 2G cases.
The bench, however, said, "We don't believe so."
Singh also contended that the NGO must reveal the name of the "mole" while submitting that the kind of affidavit filed by the NGO (on allegations against Sinha) should not be permitted as otherwise anyone would be allowed to get away even after making baseless allegations in the apex court.
The court directed that all documents, including CBI files and the visitors' list register pertaining to the allegations against the top cop, be handed over to SPP Anand Grover, who will go through all the information and assist the court on the next date of hearing on October 10.
At the beginning of the proceedings, senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the NGO, and Prashant Bhushan tendered an unconditional apology before the apex court for its "inability" to reveal the name of the whistleblower and pleaded for recall of its earlier order on disclosing the name.
Dave further submitted that it is not an attempt at character assassination of the CBI director but the apex court must look into the allegations levelled against him which need to be probed.

Fingers crossed: Isro to test-fire Mangalyaan engine shortlyComments
With  less than 48 hours left before the spacecraft enters Mars’ orbit, scientists of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) have successfully test-fired its liquid engine.
Before the test-firing, Annadurai, programme director at Isro, told Hindustan Times: “The test firing is like a trial. The dormant engine has to be brought back to life. It is a challenge but if one is prepared well for the exam, the confidence for success is higher.”
The nail-biting prelim was carried out at 2:30pm when the craft’s 440 Newton Liquid Apogee Motor engine, which has been idle for 300 days, was fired up for four seconds. The fourth and final trajectory corrections were also made.
“The engine will be fired for nearly 4 seconds and almost half a kg of fuel will be needed for this operation,” says Koteshwar Rao, scientific secretary, Isro before the test-firing
On September 24 it will be put in action along with eight thrusters to slow down Mangalyaan so it can be injected into a safe orbit around the Red Planet.
Isro launched the Mangalyaan on November 5 to find evidence of life on Mars. If the spacecraft makes it, India will be the fourth after US, Russia and Europe to reach the Red planet. Once in orbit, the craft’s five payloads will take pictures and collect data for the next six months.
Probes to Mars have a high failure rate. Of the 51 missions so far, only 21 have succeeded. A similar mission by China failed in 2011.

Emboldened by the BJP’s success in the Lok Sabha elections, the RSS has intensified its efforts to find and validate a common Hindu thread to unify all groups under one Hindu identity.
Three top RSS leaders have sought to attribute the genesis of Dalits, tribals and many other groups to “Muslim invasion” in medieval times.
 They articulated these views in their forewords to three books, authored by BJP spokesman Vijay Sonkar Shastri and released by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat recently — “Hindu Charmakar Jati”, “Hindu Khatik Jati” and “Hindu Valmiki Jati”.
The Sangh leaders claimed that these castes had come into existence due to atrocities by foreign invaders and did not exist in Hindu religion earlier.
According to Bhaiyyaji Joshi, No.2 in RSS hierarchy, ‘shudras’ were never untouchables in Hindu scriptures. ‘Islamic atrocities’ during the medieval age resulted in the emergence of untouchables, Dalits and Indian Muslims.
Joshi further elaborated, “To violate Hindu swabhiman (dignity) of Chanwarvanshiya Kshatriyas, foreign invaders from Arab, Muslim rulers and beef-eaters, forced them to do abominable works like killing cows, skinning them and throwing their carcasses in deserted places. Foreign invaders thus created a caste of charma-karma (dealing with skin) by giving such works as punishment to proud Hindu prisoners.”
Another top RSS functionary, Suresh Soni, echoed the same: “Dalits had their genesis during Turks, Muslims and Mughal eras. Today’s castes like Valmikis, Sudarshan, Majhabi Sikhs and their 624 sub-castes came into being as a result of atrocities against Brahmins and Kshatriyas during Medieval or Islamic age,” he wrote.
Krishna Gopal, Sah-sarkaryavah, RSS, went on to bolster the Sangh’s new found agenda saying, “In pre-historic and Vedic age, Khatik castes have been recognized as Brahmins who affected sacrifices. It may be noted that before the advent of Muslim invaders, there is no reference to rearing pigs in India.
It was a vocation adopted by Hindus to defend their religion.”
The RSS has been focusing on research in this area of late. One of its affiliated organisations had recently organised a conclave of over 100 historians to discuss historiography and changes required to give a proper perspective.
An overarching Hindu identity beyond any castes or sub-castes is an objective that the RSS has been striving for decades, despite being projected as an upper caste outfit. The BJP itself, under the stewardship of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, has been actively reaching out to Dalits and OBCs. The Sangh’s latest move looks set to re-ignite a debate on history and historians.

Gold Looks Likely to Test $1 200; Silver Slumps to Four-year LowThe Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
Singapore: Silver's sell-off extended to a second session on Monday, with the metal tumbling to a four-year low, as investors unwound long positions amid strength in the dollar and the possibility of a sooner-than-expected US rate hike.
Weakness in gold, which fell to its lowest since January and was edging close to breaking below $1,200 an ounce, also weighed on silver and other precious metals.
The precious metals group has seen sharp losses in recent days as the dollar index hit a four-year high last week on expectations the world's biggest economy will see the start of its rate-tightening cycle sooner-than-expected.
"It is hard to get too excited about the precious metals group at this stage, as poor and uninspiring technicals will likely continue to exert pressure on prices," INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said in a note.
Spot silver slid to $17.30 an ounce - its lowest since June 2010, while spot gold dipped to $1,208.36 - its lowest since early January - before recovering modestly to trade at $1,211.96 by 0649 GMT.
Platinum hit fresh nine-month lows of $1,322.30 on Monday. Palladium also slipped and is down about $100 since hitting a 13-1/2-year high on September 1.
"It looks like we can see further long liquidation for silver," said one precious metals trader in Sydney. "The next key support at $16.60. And if we do trade under $17, there will be significant stop-loss orders around that level."
Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday also showed that hedge funds and money managers switched silver into a net short position for the first time since mid-June.
"Gold is also vulnerable to the downside," the trader said. "Immediate support is at $1,200, also a key psychological level, then $1,180."
Gold's recent losses have erased almost all of its 2014 gains, with the metal now up only 0.7 per cent from last year, when it lost 28 per cent of its value.
Gold has been under pressure recently as speculation has mounted that the US Federal Reserve will increase interest rates sooner than expected on a strong economy.
Any increase in rates would dim the appeal of non-interest-bearing assets such as bullion.
Investor interest has dipped as seen in recent flows of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund. The ETF's holdings fell 7.78 tonnes to 776.44 tonnes on Friday - its lowest since December 2008.

Deadlock continues: Amit Shah calls Uddhav as BJP  Shiv Sena bicker over seat sharingComments
The deadlock over seat-sharing between the BJP and the Shiv Sena continued Monday but the alliance partners appeared willing to accommodate each other’s concerns, keeping hopes of reconciliation alive.
The BJP sent a fresh proposal to the Shiv Sena, offering to contest 130 seats -- five down from its initial demand of 135 --- in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly but also hinted it was ready to go it alone.
A day after it made the senior ally the “final offer” of 119 seats, the Sena -– through informal channels -- indicated it was willing to concede another six seats to the BJP, sources said. The Sena had Sunday set aside 151 seats for itself.
For weeks, the saffron combine has been fighting bitterly over the number of seats each party will contest in the October 15 state election.
The alliance fancies its chances this time and whichever party gets more seats, will also get the CM’s post.
“In a contingent situation that the BJP is compelled not to contest with the Shiv Sena, we would go it alone on all 288 seats but we will prefer that Shiv Sena comes along,” BJP general secretary in-charge for Maharashtra Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.

The BJP, said sources, was yet to receive a formal response from Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on its fresh demand for 130 seats.
“We have shown some flexibility... Sena should give us those seats where chances of its victory are nil.” There are some 59 seats that the Sena has not won in last five elections.
Late Sunday, the party’s central election committee had finalised candidates for more than 200 seats, sources said. In case of a split, the BJP would “accommodate” the three smaller parties that are part of the Mahayuti, or the grand alliance, the sources said.
Rudy has been asked go to Mumbai and settle things in the next two-three days. September 27 is the last day of filing election papers. The party’s election in-charge Om Mathur is already in Mumbai.
 
Thackeray had called up two senior BJP leaders on Sunday, but failed to secure any concession, a BJP leader told HT. The party, said sources, would wait for the “inauspicious” Pitrapaksha to end -- on September 24 --before announcing candidates.

The BJP leaders say they want the alliance to work but a break-up with Sena wouldn’t put the party at a disadvantage.
“We will get an opportunity to make inroads in urban areas where Modi magic will give us an advantage,” a BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.
Rudy earlier said that his party had sent “a very liberal proposal” to Sena as the 130 seats include the “worst” possible seats which its ally had never won in last 30 years. Traditionally, the Shiv Sena has fought more seats than the BJP, which wants a bigger share this time following its Lok Sabha victory.

Haryana elections: Gurgaon  Faridabad voters seek a separate manifesto6
0
New Delhi: Haryana is one of the most urbanised states in India. The National Nighway Number 1 or the Grand Trunk Road which passes through the northern part of the state is dotted with booming towns and cities. It's proximity to the National Capital New Delhi has resulted in heavy urbanisation of Haryana.
Gurgaon and Faridabad, the two districts bordering Delhi, have been completely urbanised and they look more like a suburb of Delhi than parts of Haryana, which was predominantly an agrarian state till the liberalisation of the 1990s opened up Indian economy.
Gurgaon has emerged as an Information Technology hub in north India. It is home to some of the most famous IT companies and BPOs in India. The metro link to Delhi, state of the art international airport on its border and the rapid development etc have changed the profile of once a sleepy village.
These two major cities with more than 10 fully urbanised assembly seats can change the outcome and decide who rules the state.
#haryana assembly elections 2014 #gurgaon #faridabad #bjp
Gurgaon has got a police commissionerate and has seen modernizsation of all kinds. Same is the case with its neighbouring city Faridabad. Even though, Faridabad is not as famous as Gurgaon, it has also emerged as a major hub of manufacturing industry and educational institutions.
However, when it comes to politics, both the cities look like any other city in Haryana. Even though, everybody who ruled the state from Chandigarh has exploited Gurgaon and Haryana for huge monetary gains for themselves and the state, not much work has been done when it comes to development.
Gurgaon, which is home to some Manhattan type glitzy towers, suffers from lack of better roads, street lights, sanitation, public toilets and poor law and order etc. The situation is almost same in Faridabad.
The ruling Congress in the state has lost both Gurgaon and Faridabad Lok Sabha seats in the recent Lok Sabha elections, raising hope among the BJP cadre that it can sweep these two areas in the coming Assembly elections.
The residnets of Gurgaon and Faridabad are now demanding that all political parties contesting the election must come up with a separate manifesto for them. A first time voter from Gurgaon said, "These two cities are almost like parts of Delhi. Haryana government must treat them like big cities, not like any other semi-urban area of the state. All governments have milked both of them in the last 25 years and filled their coffers. This is time to demand better amenities."
The residents of Faridabad also demand similar things.
Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda claims that under his leadership both the cities have been elevated to a different stature and have seen massive developments. The opposition parties allege that Hooda has milked these two cities for personal gains and has done nothing for the public. They argue that soaring real estate price has helped only a few powerful and deprived a large number of farmers of their precious agricultural land.
Gurgaon Lok Sabha constituency has fully developed urban assembly seats like Sohna, Badshahpur, Pataudi while Faridabad has assembly constituencies like Prithla, Hodal, Palwal, Tigaon etc.
In a small state like Haryana with just 90 members in the Assembly, these two major cities with more than 10 fully urbanised assembly seats can change the outcome and decide who rules the state.

Monsanto India sees Indian biz growing 3 times in next 3 years.Suprotip Ghosh      Follow @suprotip    Last Updated: September 23, 2014  | 11:11 IST
Monsanto India CEO Shilpa Divekar Nirula
Shilpa Divekar Nirula took over the mantle of CEO at Monsanto India last month. Passionate about agriculture, Nirula is presiding over a company that is transforming from just being a seeds and biotechnology company into one which will provide farmers with services including weather information, farming and seed support. In her first interview after becoming CEO, she tells Suprotip Ghosh about Monsanto's plans.
 
Q- What are the plans for Monsanto in India in the medium to long term?
A- We are transforming into a solutions company. This means that here's my farmer; I will look at one of the needs of my farmer, I may not be the sole provider of those needs. As a company, Monsanto will provide some aspect of those solutions including agronomic advice. But then how do we partner and collaborate with a whole host of others, so that if we can address a farmer, we sort of give the correct inputs collectively so that he can achieve his objectives. This is directionally where we look to go as a company.
 
Q- So from a biotechnology company you are going to become a solutions and services company?
A- We already have one million farmers with whom we have been working. We will reach out to them. There is the issue of reading and language skills, we don't want to lose out on farmers who may not necessarily be able to read very fluently. It is very fascinating in terms of what is possible.
 
Q- In the next three to five years, what are the concrete goals you have in mind?
A- There are three or four spaces. Very clearly, we will continue to focus on our core, which is very clearly our seed business - cotton, corn and vegetables. We do a lot of R&D, which is focussed on developing germplasm, which is the seed required for Indian conditions. India has seven to eight different agronomic zones, and each of those has different climatic conditions, soil patterns, farmers are different, so they tend to differ. So how can we continue to  develop the seed that are needed. The third area will be the whole services space. How we can evolve to become a solutions company to the farmers. As we go ahead, we will seek to partner with various companies who are participating  in agriculture in very different ways.  It could  be a weather services company, for example. There may be opportunities to combine some of the opportunities with insurance - farmers are exposed to a lot of weather risk, for instance, and we are very open to collaboration  and partnerships.
 
Q- Would you consider collaborating with insurance companies?
A- We are open to collaboration and partnerships and it has played out quite well in the cotton technology business. And that will form the central pillar of what we will do in the country.
 
Q- What kind of growth targets do you have?
A- Like every company we have our cycles of what we can achieve and therefore plan. I think we could over the next five years look at growing the Indian business at least three times the current size. That is only possible if we bring what is the most relevant to the Indian farmer. And we are completely focussed on that.
 
Q- Can you be more specific as to which areas these are?
A- Water is a huge challenge in the country; agriculture is the biggest user of water, and many parts of India are already below the threshold of how much the water table has shrunk, for example. That's another area of focus as we develop our seeds for Indian conditions. As we work in partnerships  along with state governments. We would like to work on how farmers would do agriculture more sustainably. A day will come when it might be impossible to grow anything on that land. It doesn't end without tying up the whole chain together. But if you want to talk to farmers and say ok, you are growing a crop which is using a lot of water, and I want you to switch to something else, as a government, or a state government, he would say, who's going to buy my produce? That is the biggest concern - that today I am growing a crop and someone's going to come and buy my produce. Tomorrow I may grow a crop and no one might be interested. So we are increasingly thinking about how can we actually bring those linkages. A big area of opportunity is to see how this can become a more integrated chain. A seed company, starting with the farmer from the seed it will plant to the output and seeing who needs that output. It isn't really easy in the first year, but you will have to hang on in there.
 
Q- Does this mean, for instance, there will be ketchup companies setting up factories in places where there is tomato produced?
A- I think there will be people seeking to find a place where they can create established capacity, so that the produce is available closer. If you look at corn today, it is all over, and there is a lot of quality degradation as it is transported over long distances. We see more and more capacity coming up in starch, or poultry and there is a real opportunity to build these in the hubs where some of the actual production is happening so that the time it needs to travel to get to the point where it is going to get processed reduces.
Q- You mentioned getting closer to the farmer. How do you want to achieve that in terms of the services play?
A- There is an opportunity to get more information out to our farmers. So that they can use the resources that they have to get far better yields or say costs. I think there is an opportunity there. I think farming is the riskiest profession in the country today. You saw what has happened in the monsoon and the peak planting season. It causes a lot of angst among farmers because it will decide on whether they would earn any money which will last them the rest of the year. Crop insurance in the country is very limited, it is largely linked to loans so there is always an insurance cover. Weather insurance penetration to the so-called non-loanee farmers is less than four per cent. This element of 'secure' has a lot of opportunity.
 
Q- What is the workaround for water problems?
A- We are working on drought-tolerant seeds. Depending on where it is in the various stages of R&D, we will bring it to market.

IS tells followers to attack US  French citi...The United States is building an international coalition to destroy the radical Sunni Muslim group, which has seized swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BAGHDAD: Islamic State urged its followers on Monday to attack citizens of the United States, France and other countries which have joined a coalition to destroy the militant group.
Islamic State spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani also taunted US President Barack Obama and other Western "crusaders" in a statement carried by the SITE monitoring website, saying their forces faced inevitable defeat at the militants' hands.
The United States is building an international coalition to combat the radical Sunni Muslim group, which has seized swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria and proclaimed a caliphate in the heart of the Middle East .
US and French warplanes have struck Islamic State targets in Iraq and on Sunday the United States said other countries had indicated a willingness to join it if it goes ahead with air strikes against the group in Syria too.
Adnani said the military intervention by the US-led coalition would be the "final campaign of the crusaders", according to the transcript published by SITE.
"It will be broken and defeated, just as all your previous campaigns were broken and defeated," he said in the statement, which urged followers to attack US, French, Canadian, Australian and other nationals.
Obama has authorised airstrikes in Syria aimed at denying Islamic State fighters safe havens there. Washington has also committed $500 million to arm and train Syrian rebels and has sent 1,600 US troops back into Iraq to fight the group..
In his statement, Adnani mocked Western leaders over their deepening military engagement in the region and said Obama was repeating the mistakes of his predecessor, George W. Bush.
"If you fight it (Islamic State), it becomes stronger and tougher. If you leave it alone, it grows and expands. If Obama has promised you with defeating the Islamic State, then Bush has also lied before him," Adnani said, according to the transcript.
Addressing Obama directly, Adnani added: "O mule of the Jews, you claimed today that America would not be drawn into a war on the ground. No, it will be drawn and dragged. It will come down to the ground and it will be led to its death, grave and destruction."
Obama, who has spent much of his tenure extracting the United States from Iraq after its costly 2003 invasion and occupation, is sensitive to charges that he is being drawn into another long campaign that risks US soldiers' lives.
While Obama has ruled out a combat mission, military officials say the reality of a protracted campaign in Iraq and possibly Syria may ultimately require greater use of US troops, including tactical air strike spotters or front-line advisers embedded with Iraqi forces.

Expect 5-7% correction in market till October  which makes for a buying opportunity: BofAauto ancillaries
('Most of the global strategists…)
In an interview with ET Now, Jyotivardhan Jaipuria, Head of Research, BofA-ML, shares his views on the market and some sectors. Excerpts:
ET Now: Are you bullish or are you generally cautious on the markets, considering the run up not just locally but globally as well?
Jyotivardhan Jaipuria: We do hope to see a correction of about 5-7% in the market, which will provide a better opportunity to buy. I am quite bullish from a three-four year perspective and we think earnings and markets could double out over four years. So, if you ask me, if there would be a better chance to buy, the answer probably is yes. Our view, from here till the end of October, is that we see the markets lower by around 5% to 7%.
ET Now: Globally, the theme seems to be that there will be dollar strength and some rate hikes, which could lead to a 5% to 10% drop. Could that happen in a very near term?
Jyotivardhan Jaipuria: This was exactly what people expected in December last year. Most of the global strategists thought there will be a dollar strength coming through, which can play out for the first half of the year, but, it has come in now. Moreover, the US Fed rate hike is in store and typically, a lot of volatility sets in when markets believe that a Fed hike is likely. So, while the Indian markets have had a good run, I guess it's time to look for a breather. Dollar strength and the US Fed rate hike could be some of the reasons for a pullback.
ET Now: Is it going to a short-term correction in an otherwise lengthy bull market?
Jyotivardhan Jaipuria: Yes, it will be a short-term tactical correction, after which earnings recovery will start coming through with economic recovery. A lot of indicators of profit cycle seem to show that we are somewhere close to the bottom and could get a sharp upswing. So our view is that over the next four years, profits in India are going to double.
ET Now: Is it going to be a blanket correction or more sector-specific? How do you plan to go about it?
Jyotivardhan Jaipuria: Typically, in these corrections, most of our clients on the institutional side do not have the ability to take cash calls. However, to the extent they can, people do take a bit of a cash call and keep cash coming through. In this correction, typically the mid and small caps fall more than the large caps. I guess, for most investors, this is a time to buy or sell since it depends on how nimble you can be. Otherwise, all you have to do is to use the dips to start buying.
ET Now: This correction won't only be India-specific, but we are going to see that happen in the US as well. Do you buy defensives, like IT, again?
Jyotivardhan Jaipuria: For the next three-four years, IT is not something that we are overweight on, though we were so for the last few years. We have a neutral call on IT now, since it will be a market performer over the next few years. Our view is that you buy all the stocks which have not done well in the last few years. So, if you get a correction in some of those names, it is time to buy. We are overweight on autos, banks, cements and the oil PSUs.
ET Now: A lot is expected from the PM's maiden visit to the US. Will it be of any significance for the markets?
Jyotivardhan Jaipuria: We have had a couple of visits in the past few months, where the PM went to Japan and the Chinese premier was here. To that extent, these visits help in reinforcing that there is lot of attention on India and FDI flow on India will come in a big way over the next few years. This will ultimately help the recovery process.
Having said that, I do not really see anything specific coming in, because a lot of these are just building blocks for growth over the next three-four years. There are FDI promises and the PM is marketing the India story and making sure India looks an attractive place for FDI.
ET Now: Are you constructive on the infra pocket or will you wait before some positive or green shoots emerge?
Jyotivardhan Jaipuria: We are constructive on the entire infra space, but our view has been that these stocks will be late movers. Whatever steps the government takes, it will take 12 to 18 months to get the entire infra capex cycle back in place because companies need to repair their balance sheets and excess capacity in the system needs to start working out. This is why our initial emphasis was to buy consumer plays like autos or cement, because these are the early movers and the infra capex will be a late mover. So, people who are a bit more patient can buy some of these stocks and then wait to play it out. But they will have to time it to perfection.
  ET Now: Are you also bullish on auto ancillaries or for that matter tyre stocks which have given good returns to investors?
Jyotivardhan Jaipuria: Yes, we are bullish on auto ancillaries. We do not cover all that many of them, but whatever we do, we are quite bullish on them.

First Scouts and Guides training centre to come up in BijapurUpdated: September 22, 2014 14:30 IST
First Scouts and Guides training centre to come up in Bijapur

The Hindu The Scouts and Guides cadets planting saplings at their new training centre being built in Burnapur village of Bijapur taluk.
The Bijapur district is on its way to have its first district Scouts and Guides training centre coming up in Burnapur village of Bijapur taluk.
The centre which is spread in over 15 acre land, has all the potential to become the third state training centre after Deddaballapur and Kondajji of Davangere district.
The building which is being built presently at the cost of Rs. 30 lakh, however, has plans to develop as a full-fledge state training centre, said Siddanna Sakri, Commissioner, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Bijapur district.
Speaking to The Hindu, he said that the Scouts and Guide training is essential among students for developing a sense of patriotism.
“The training also helps them to become courageous volunteers to serve during natural or man-made calamities to rescue victims”, Mr. Sakri said.
With regard to the building he said, after continuous efforts, a major portion of centre is being built. However, other facilities such as dormitories and toilets for girls and boys are yet to be constructed.
“In order to expand the district centre to state centre, we have submitted a proposal of Rs. 2.37 crore to the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education for granting funds. The government, after making preliminary inquiry has found that the demand is genuine. We hope that the government would release the funds soon”, he said.
Mentioning the benefits of the joining Scouts and Guides, he said that the Railway department has 5 per cent reservation for the scouts who have won State or national level certificates. The State government too offers 5 per cent reservation in technical courses.
Mr. Sakri informed that the State has around 50,000 scouts while Bijapur has 2500. Some sixty students of the district have won state award while 22 have won national award.
“Unfortunately, only some 20 per cent of the schools in the district have this service. We are ready to offer help if the schools come forward to have facility for students in their schools”, he said.

A share buyback to the tune of USD 2-3 billion (Rs 12,000-18,000 crore) would boost earnings-per-share by as much as 1.4-2.2 percent in fiscal year 2016 while lifting return-on-equity by 4 to 7 percentage points, according to a research report by Morgan Stanley.
This could increase the fair value of  Infosys stock by about 10-20 percent, leading to a rerating in the price-to-earnings multiple, the firm said, which has a price target of Rs 4,000.
Infosys has never declared a buyback in its history though the company came under pressure to declare one from former chief financial officers V Balakrishnan and Mohandas Pai who wrote a letter to it recently.
Once a bellwether of the Indian IT industry, Infosys’ growth rate has fallen behind larger rival TCS’ over the past several years, which has led analysts to put pressure on the conservative company to put to better use its Rs 30,000-crore cash pile – such as on acquisitions or share buybacks.
The former CFOs had said the company could buy back shares worth up to Rs 11,000 crore, a move they said could bridge the “dramatic valuation gap” between Infosys and its peers.
Infosys shares have consistently under-performed those of its peers in the past few years as growth slowed down. Today, TCS is valued at Rs 5.27 lakh crore compared to Rs 2.09 lakh crore for Infosys thanks to its superior sales and profit growth record recently.
Recently, Infosys did increase its dividend payout ratio (the percentage of annual profits to pays out to shareholders via dividends versus what it retains) from up to 30 percent to 40 percent. But this, Morgan Stanley, believes should be even higher.
However, to be clear, Morgan Stanley said that it does not believe that a buyback could be a significant driver of a rally in the share price and has thus kept it out of its valuation estimates, especially given the fact that the new growth-focused management led by new CEO Vishal Sikka, has not given any indication of undertaking a buyback.
“We have seen this with Cognizant, which recently expanded its share buy-back program from USD 1.5 billion to USD 2 billion (till December 2015). Out of this, Cognizant has already repurchased stock worth USD 1.1 billion, implying repurchase of about USD 1 billion over the balance of 2014 and 2015,” it said. “However, there has been no material impact on stock price performance.”
Infosys’ share prices, however, would be driven by improving business momentum (better revenue and profitability growth), a trend which is underway, according to the firm.
“On top of this, if Infosys were to increase its dividend payout, we believe it would make an irresistible combination,” it said.
Infosys stock price
On November 21, 2014, Infosys closed at Rs 4146.10, down Rs 75.6, or 1.79 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 4232.40 and the 52-week low was Rs 2894.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 203.80 per share as per the quarter ended June 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 20.34. The latest book value of the company is Rs 733.03 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 5.66.

We need few course corrections to boost manufacturingWe need few course corrections to boost manufacturing: Devendra Surana, MD of  Bhagyanagar India
Devendra Surana        Last Updated: September 15, 2014  | 15:25 IST
Devendra Surana, managing director of Bhagyanagar India.
I am very passionate about manufacturing. I come from IIM Bangalore, which is one of the most prestigious institutions in India. I am one from a batch of 140 students.
More than 100 of these are engineers, most of them from IITs. In the 25th year reunion of our batch recently, I started asking around as to what most of them were doing.
To my surprise, in the batch of 140 students, only five were from the manufacturing sector. Of those five, three including me happened to be in manufacturing because they have inherited a manufacturing enterprise.
It is a shameful misuse of talent available in the country. It led me to look at what ails our manufacturing.
For many years, the manufacturing sector was highly taxed. In fact, 20 per cent of the economy used to pay up to 80 per cent of the taxes. The manufacturing sector is easy to tax as there are some underlying goods.Further, factories are a concentrated source of tax.
Even today manufacturing (16 per cent of GDP ) pays more excise duty than services (60 per cent of GDP) pays service taxes. In addition, manufactured goods suffer taxes such as sales tax, octroi, entry tax, etc. Any sector which is taxed will not attract any resources including human resources.
Unfortunately, the story does not end here. In addition to the high taxation there is a huge burden put on manufacturing for all sorts of subsidies which the government wants to give. The prime example is electricity.
Electricity is the most important utility for manufacturing. There is 60 per cent additional charge put on industry so that farmers can get free power for agriculture.
Industry is definitely not against any form of subsidy, which is required in a developing economy. However, the burden of this subsidy should not fall on industry.
Electricity for manufacturing is like blood to a human body. Manufacturing cannot survive without reliable, good quality, reasonably priced electricity. We have a situation where consumers cannot get electricity at Rs 6 per unit and producers cannot sell electricity at Rs 3 a unit.
If we look at freight, it is more expensive to send material from Hyderabad to Delhi than sending it from Shanghai to New York. Once again, one of the major factors in this sector is cross-subsidy.
The railways want to subsidise passenger freight by more than 50 per cent. Unfortunately, the entire burden falls on freight traffic, which negatively impacts the industrial sector.
If we look at other sectors like water, land or even interest rates, just in order to fulfill some other objectives of the government we find that the industries are being unfairly treated. Unless all these anomalies are removed we cannot compete in the local market, leave alone go and conquer the global market.
Unfortunately, in the face of such heavy taxation, the only solution the government thinks is to give subsidy to industry.
Today, if any subsidy is to be collected from the government, an entrepreneur has to spend a lot of time and energy and expense to collect the money. A case in point is the incentives of the Andhra Pradesh government.
Most incentives are overdue for three to four years. Instead of giving any incentives or subsidies it is far better to reduce taxation in one of the sectors mentioned above.
 
In February, at the time of bifurcation, a special package was announced for Andhra Pradesh. Unfortunately, there are a lot of rumors as what exactly this package will entail.
The Andhra Pradesh government believes that it will get an excise duty waiver for all new units set up in the state. An excise duty benefit will make any new unit set up elsewhere uncompetitive.
Hence, all investors are awaiting clarification before making an investment decision and all investment decisions are frozen. If any single unit decides to delay an investment it does not impact the economy. However, today a whole host of industries are in a wait-and-watch mode and this can have a very negative impact on overall growth.
 
The Union government needs to immediately get this uncertainty out of the way so that people can decide to put up their investments either in Andhra Pradesh or elsewhere depending on the viability of the package. This is most important to unleash fresh investments in the economy.
I am an eternal optimist and I see great days ahead for manufacturing. The essential ingredients are all there, probably at the best combination in the last 70 years. Today, we have the potential for a huge demand simply because our base is very low. If we take any manufactured product, our production and consumption is one-eighth that of China.
If we assume that we will reach where China is today in 20 years we require a compound growth rate of 11 per cent per annum. Secondly, we have the human resources to fulfill this requirement.
The availability of skilled manpower at a relatively low cost is a competitive benefit which will last for at least two decades, long enough to fulfill our manufacturing potential. We can fulfill our prime minister's dream of Made in India a reality if we can do a few minor course corrections.

Is the midlife crisis just an excuseIs the midlife crisis just an excuse?
By Emma Jacobs
Elizabeth has had enough of life as a City lawyer. Now, in her mid-thirties, she has decided to change careers. “Life is short,” she says, wincing at the cliché.
As the first person in her family to make it to university, Elizabeth – who does not want to use her real name – had felt obliged to follow through with a sensible profession. Her twenties were consumed by office all-nighters, finding her way and proving herself. When she hit her thirties, while the hours continued to be punishing, she felt able to lift her nose from the grindstone and evaluate her career. “I am not as engaged in my work as my peers,” she reflects. To make partner she would have to crank up her commitment – and she just cannot bear to do that. So in her spare time she studies psychology, in anticipation of switching professional tracks .
More
Three generations, one office
She admits to feelings that border on depression but views them as a “productive indication” that she no longer wants to be a lawyer and desires a job with “more meaning”. A “ midlife crisis ” is how she views it.
“Midlife crisis” is not a clinical disorder. However, Dr Michael Sinclair, a consultant psychologist based in the City, has observed increasing numbers of thirtysomethings experiencing profound anxiety about their career choices and lives. “These are problems more commonly associated with people in their mid-forties thinking about mortality. They are coming out of recession, a period of being single-minded. They are burnt out and asking ‘what’s the point of work?’”
Louise Matthews , a former personal assistant in recruitment and insurance, believes that the “midlife crisis is beginning earlier these days”. She suggests it could be “because we have too much choice and information coming”, which can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction but also paralysis. “It can be pretty overwhelming.”
The notion of a midlife crisis, is contentious. Coined in 1965 by Elliot Jaques, a psychologist, he described it as “the adult encounter with the conception of life to be lived in the setting of an approaching personal death”. In popular mythology it is generally characterised by fortysomething men swapping families and jobs for sports cars, hair plugs and young girlfriends – all rather silly.
However, research published earlier this year found an average midlife dip in happiness – or subjective wellbeing as it is described by economists – happened between 40 and 42. Professor Nattavudh Powdthavee, co-author of the longitudinal research across three countries, says this confirms previous studies that show a hill-shape relationship between age and the use of antidepressants. It builds on research, published in 2012, that found chimpanzees and orangutans also experience a U-shape in happiness (as reported by zookeepers rather than the apes themselves). Prof Powdthavee says this suggests there could be biological explanations behind the midlife nadir. He sees this as a reason to be optimistic. “When you know this, you can go through the period thinking at some point it will get better.”
Mid-life crises can manifest themselves in different ways. “It is a transitionary phase,” says Dr Derek Milne, a psychologist from Newcastle University and author of Coping With a Mid-Life Crisis. “It can be intermittent or express itself as vague disquiet.”
Perhaps people in middle age can learn from the elderly who feel less regret and have adapted
Dr Hannes Schwandt of Princeton University believes midlife, unlike infancy and old age, is under-researched. Last year, he published research focused on “unmet expectations”. It found the young are optimistic – perhaps even “over-optimistic” – while those in their forties and fifties feel regret, before making their peace in older age. “Perhaps people in middle age can learn from the elderly who feel less regret and have adapted,” he suggests.
The fallout from midlife malaise might make people less productive, notes Dr Schwandt. Employers might therefore want to take note. “It could improve peoples’ wellbeing if we acknowledged the problem”, he says.
Jodie Rogers, a careers coach, says work is a source of crisis for her middle-aged clients. “They ask themselves what legacy they are leaving behind. They start to feel bad about feeling discontented. They have a job and pay cheque, they don’t know if they have the right to seek more. There is a real tug of war between the feeling they should be satisfied with their life and wanting to do something more meaningful.”
Paul Dolan, professor of behavioural science at the London School of Economics, and author of Happiness by Design, believes we need a mix of purpose and pleasure in order to feel truly happy. In a forthcoming paper, he argues that much of the economic literature on midlife crises focuses on our evaluations of what makes us happy rather than our actual experiences. In other words, the stories we tell ourselves about what makes us happy – that a prestigious job is good – even if our day-to-day experience of the work makes us miserable.
Other experts, however, dismiss any connection between age and crisis. Susan Krauss Whitbourne, professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, sees age as a “social construct, highly dependent on the individual”. The attraction of seeing midlife as a period prone to crisis, she says is akin to horoscopes: “It gives you certainty. It gives an excuse and an expectation.”
She does, however, think that today, more people want to express their true sense of self in their job.
Elizabeth agrees – she says her parents are baffled by her career dissatisfaction: “They say it is a luxury of my generation. They never thought of enjoying their careers – they just got on with it.”
Many people, says Prof Whitbourne, fantasise about dramatically quitting their jobs. But, she says, “it is better to make baby steps towards a change”.
Dr Sinclair agrees: “People can be too goal-focused. They have ticked off making money and career goals, and wonder what next?” He helps them to understand life is not about ticking off their goals but living by their values. Rather than resign, they may find that making small changes in their jobs, for example collaborating with colleagues or mentoring a junior employee, can make work feel more meaningful.
Further reading: Premium on youth puts careers in a corner
Arguably one of the biggest career anxieties for people in midlife is age discrimination, writes Emma Jacobs. “Older workers are often targeted during downturns because they are more experienced employees,” explains Patricia Cohen, author of In Our Prime: The Invention of Middle Age , “Their wages are higher and they may have more extensive benefits.” Moreover, the premium that many businesses put on youth, or the association between youth and creativity or innovation, can make middle-aged workers feel devalued.
Meanwhile, the ability to shift careers in midlife without worrying about income has become increasingly rare, she argues. “Those who have such options are very fortunate.”

J&K Floods to Have  Minimal  Impact on LICSebi Bars Transgene Chief, 5 Officials From Capital Markets
Mumbai: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), which has nearly 13 lakh customers in the flood-ravaged Jammu & Kashmir, has said the financial impact of the massive tragedy would be "very minimal" on the company.
"Financial impact due to the massive floods in Kashmir this month will be very nominal for us. Even after the massive devastation caused by Uttarakhand landslides last year, the financial implication on us was very small, at under Rs 7 crore from 435 claims, while in Kashmir the loss of lives is lower at less than 300," LIC chairman Surya Kumar Roy told PTI during an interaction in Mumbai without attributing a number to it, adding that so far no claims have been made.
He said that LIC has 12.7 lakh policyholders in the flood-ravaged state, making it the largest player there.
"With an insurance density of only 4 per cent, if we calculate loss of lives from the floods at 300, this works out to be merely 12 claims. Our assured sum in the state is Rs 16,435 crore as of last fiscal, out of our total 12.7 lakh policyholders," Mr Roy said.
After the worst landslide in Uttarakhand last year, in which hundreds of people were killed, LIC received only 435 claims worth Rs 6.8 crore (assured sum), Mr Roy said, adding that out of these 435 claims, as many as 98 per cent were from outside the affected state.
Answering a question whether LIC would once again be forced to bail out massive disinvestment plans of the government beginning next week, MR Roy, who took charge on July 1, 2013, said that the impression about his company being forced to pick up stakes in government companies was baseless.
"Tell me, is there a single PSU in which we lost money?" he said, adding, "Most of the investments have given us good returns, to the tune of over 40 per cent and in some cases even more than double."

F&0 expiry to weigh on market trade this weekMarket to remain range-bound ahead of F&O expiry

Last week the US Federal Reserve indicated that it would keep interest rates low for a considerable period even after ending quantitative easing (QE). This would be a big positive for markets like India . It would mean that the flow of dollars will continue into growth markets.
Since the Lehman crisis the US economy has shown plenty of signs of recovery. However, this growth was purely driven on credit and therefore it has to be seen how the US economy performs after the ending of QE. Even if the US is able to stand on its feet - which the  market largely expects - the Federal Reserve will not increase rates anytime soon. It is unlikely that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be in a hurry to cut rates. It will be interesting to see RBI's next move in its monetary policy on September 30.
A rate hike in the US will be bad news for emerging markets. It will see an outflow of money from global markets including India to the US. The market has discounted the US increasing rates by July 2015. The fact that the US is not likely to hike rates in the near future  is the only trigger for  and the precise reason why the Indian market is trading in the positive zone.
This has also seen fund managers expecting the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex to climb higher. In the seventh Business Today-Morningstar asset allocation survey, 80 per cent see the Sensex hovering between 28,000 and 30,000 in the next six months, while no one expects it to fall - if at all it does - below 26,000 points.
In 2008, the Indian market had seen participation from all sources - foreign institutional investors (FIIs), mutual funds, insurance, retail and private equity. This time round it is just the FIIs.
In the last few months, mutual funds have started seeing some positive flows but it is more of high net worth individuals (HNIs) money, while participation from insurance is absent, retail is on the sidelines and private equity funds are finding ways to exit. Until there is greater participation from all segments, the Indian market is still on shaky ground.
With no near-term trigger this market will continue to remain rangebound. Any surprise from the second quarter results from India Inc could act as a trigger for the market. Advance tax numbers of some blue chip companies gives some hope that the September 2014 quarterly results could be positive.
Meanwhile, this week the Indian market is expected to take cues from global events. The market is also expected to remain range-bound ahead of the F&O expiry on Thursday. Last week, the market moved higher with most of the players covering their short positions which helped the BSE Sensex end above 27,000. This week the market will also keep an eye on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit and his meeting with President Barack Obama.

G20 suggests steps to boost global growth by 1.8%Ian Chua and Cecile Lefort     Cairns   Last Updated: September 22, 2014  | 12:26 IST
Delegates of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting pose together during an official photograph in the Cairns, Australia (Photo: Reuters)
The Group of 20 leading nations say they are tantalisingly close to adding an extra $2 trillion to the global economy and creating millions of new jobs, but Europe's extended stagnation remains a major stumbling block.
Finance Ministers and central bank chiefs of G20 nations gathered in Cairns claimed progress on fireproofing the world's financial system and on closing tax loopholes exploited by giant multinationals.
They also dealt with the thorny problem of whether to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the G20 leaders' summit in November given events in Ukraine, with the consensus being to maintain diplomatic pressure but leave the door open for his attendance.
"We are determined to lift growth, and countries are willing to use all our macroeconomic levers - monetary, fiscal and structural policies - to meet this challenge," said Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey, who hosted the event in the Australian city.
Almost 1,000 measures had been proposed that would boost global growth by 1.8 per cent by 2018, nearing the ambitious goal of 2 per centage points adopted back in February.
A common concern was the risk of Europe's economic malaise pulling others down. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew cited "philosophical" differences with some of his counterparts in Europe, especially on the need for near-term stimulus.
"The concern that I have is that if the efforts to boost demand are deferred for too long, there's a risk that the headwinds get stronger and what Europe needs is some more tailwinds in the economy," said Lew.
That was not an argument that found favour with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble who emphasised the need for structural reforms and strict budget controls.
The proposals to lift global growth will now go for formal approval at the summit of G20 leaders in Brisbane in November.
Chief among them was a global initiative aimed at increasing private investment in infrastructure, a particular hobby horse of the Australians who head the G20 this year.
CHINA GETS A PASS
While Europe's failings were front and centre, there was surprisingly little said about China's slowdown, at least publicly. That struck some as odd given the Asian giant was just behind the United States in the size of its economy.
"Our basic point on the aspirational growth target is that with China slowing down in a structural sense... It will be exceedingly difficult to hit that (2 per cent) number, given China's massive arithmetic impact," said Huw McKay, a senior international economist at Westpac.
China's Finance Minister Lou Jiwei noted that stimulus measures also brought problems such as excess capacity, environmental pollution and growing local government debt, just the latest sign that any policy easing there would be limited.
The risks that super-loose monetary policy could inflate asset bubbles was also much discussed by the G20, along with the need for the US Federal Reserve to avoid spooking markets as it winds down its quantitative easing campaign.
The US Fed is widely expected to end its asset-buying program in October and to start raising interest rates in 2015, a marked contrast to the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) where even more easing might be needed.
BANK BUFFERS
Regulators are looking at increasing the size of the capital buffer that the world's top banks need to hold to reduce the risk of a repeat of the global financial crisis.
European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said a buffer of about 16 per cent of risk-weighted assets was realistic but had not been finalised. A figure would be announced at the leaders summit, he said.
Also on the drawing board were plans to stem the loss of revenue from multinationals shifting their profits to low-tax countries, potentially reclaiming billions of dollars.
Taxation arrangements of global companies such as Google, Apple and e-commerce major Amazon.com have become a hot political topic following media and parliamentary investigations into how many companies reduce their bills.
"We have endorsed far-reaching initiatives to identify and catch tax cheats through the automatic exchange of information using a Common Reporting Standard," said Australia's Hockey.
"We encourage others to match this commitment so that there are no places to hide."

India does not need to emulate any country: PMIndia does not need to emulate any other country, says Narendra Modi
Mail Today Business     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 22, 2014  | 11:11 IST
PM Narendra Modi
India does not need to emulate the model of any other country on the path to economic development because democracy and the entrepreneurial spirit of its 1.25 billion people are capable of driving growth at a fast pace, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said.
"India does not need to become anything else. India must become only India. This is a country that once upon a time was called 'the golden bird'. We have fallen from where we were before. But now we have the chance to rise again," Modi said in an interview with CNN aired on Sunday.
"If you see the details of the last five or 10 centuries, you will see that India and China have grown at similar pace. Their contributions to global GDP have risen in parallel, and fallen in parallel. Today's era once again belongs to Asia. India and China are both growing rapidly, together. That is why India needs to remain India," he said, responding to a question about a perception among people that India will be the next China.
Modi made it clear that India would not compromise on its legacy of democracy to achieve faster economic growth. Asked specifically if he envied the power wielded by the Chinese government, Modi replied that a person like him may not have become the Prime Minister if there was no democracy. "If China is one example, then democratic countries provide another example. They have also grown fast. You can't say that growth is not possible because of democracy. Democracy is our commitment. It is our great legacy, a legacy we simply cannot compromise," he said.
"If there were no democracy then someone like me, Modi, a child born in a poor family, how would he sit here? This is the strength of democracy." Modi said he had a roadmap to channel the "unlimited talent" of Indians. "I have no doubt about our capabilities. I have a lot of faith in the entrepreneurial nature of our 1.25 billion people. There is a lot of capability," he said.
During the interview, his first since he became the PM, Modi indicated that he believed China would not allow its territorial disputes with countries like the Philippines and Vietnam to escalate. "Look at how it (China) has focused on economic development. It's hardly the sign of a country that wants to be isolated. It wants to stay connected. That is why we should have trust China's understanding and have faith that it would accept global laws and will play its role in cooperating and moving forward," he said.
Asked if he worried about China's behaviour towards its neighbours, Modi replied: "India is different. It is a country of 1.25 billion people. We can't run our country if we get worried about every small thing. At the same time, we can't close our eyes to problems." Responding to a query on Russia's annexation of the Crimea, he said India's viewpoint is that "efforts need to be made to sit together and talk, and to resolve problems in an ongoing process".
On the issue of discrimination and violence against women, Modi said the dignity of women is a "collective responsibility" on which there could be no compromise. "We have to revive the family culture in which a woman is respected and considered equal, her dignity encouraged. The main thing here is girl child education. By doing so, the possibility of empowerment will increase," he said.
Asked what he did in his spare time, Modi replied: "Look, I'm not the 'not-working' type. I derive pleasure from my work. Work gives me relaxation too. Every moment I am thinking of something new: making a new plan, new ways to work."

If you are a small company in India  you will have little success fighting a downturnSeptember 22, 2014
Few bright spots, several dark ones.
That’s the assessment by India’s central bank of corporate performance in the last financial year. As part of an annual exercise, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has released a report analysing the performance of 2,854 private companies in 2013-14. These companies reported combined revenues of Rs29,496 billion ($484.75 billion or 48% of gross domestic output). The report captures how different parts of the economy performed. These are four takeaways from it.
Size matters

When the economy slows down, the worst affected are the small and medium enterprises. In 2013-14, when India’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 4.7%, marginally higher from 4.5% a year ago, only two sets of companies in RBI’s size classification, with revenues above Rs500 crore ($82.18 million), reported growth. The other four sets, whose revenues ranged till Rs500 crore ($82.17 million), felt the squeeze being tightened. The worst among the lot were the smallest: revenues of below Rs25 crore ($4.10 million).
Growth has to go wide

Even during the slowdown, there were sectors that grew well. Information technology grew the fastest, followed by paints, pharma, paper and tea plantation. However, these five sectors accounted for only 12.6% of the total revenues of the companies analysed by the RBI. In other words, for India’s GDP to rebound sharply, the spread of growth has to be wider in the economy.

Mining was the worst-performing sector, contracting by nearly one-third. Jewellery was another sector that shrunk brutally, from 23% growth in 2012-13 to an 18% negative growth in 2013-14.
Turnarounds are few and far in between

While several sectors went from bad to worse, there were only a handful that went from bad to good. Television and communication equipment saw a reversal due to demand from telecom companies that are investing more to set up next-generation networks.
It pays to work for software firms

RBI classified companies in this study into three categories: manufacturing, information technology (IT) and services other than IT. IT employees received the highest increase in salaries in 2013-14, though it was marginally lower than in the previous fiscal. This data captures total expenditure on wages, and new hires might partly account for the changes.
The sector breakup of wages also shows how much the Indian economy has tilted away from manufacturing to services. In the RBI study, 209 IT firms spent Rs86,700 crore on salaries. By comparison, 1,966 manufacturing firms spent Rs102,300 crore ($16.82 billion) on wages, only 18% higher than what IT firms spent.

Meet Google Glass competitor Ora at $300French company wants to challenge Google Glass with price. Optinvent has priced the consumer version of Ora at $300, but claims it is better.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:46 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 7:27 pm
Finally, some hope for those who won’t be able to afford a Google Glass. A French company has unveiled a cheaper, and what it calls better, option to Google’s popular on-the-nose device. Optinvent has two versions of its dual-mode  smart glass. One a developer version called ORA-1 priced at $599 and the other a consumer version named ORA-X at $300. That makes the price a fifth of that of the $1500 Google Glass.
Ora X features a front-facing 1080p 5MP camera, a 9-axis motion sensor, wireless connectivity with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS as well as a trackpad for tactile interactions with the device. The company claims the eyewear, powered by a dual-core chip, can support complex applications can well and even has an augmented reality mode.
What really sets the Ora apart from the Google Glass is its second Flip-Vu mode, where you change the angle of the prism, to view get augmented reality with images in the field of vision and a glance mode where you look down at the image. Otherwise it is a bit thicker than the Glass on the sides.
“We don’t necessarily consider ourselves a head-on Google Glass competitor. We were around long before Glass. We started working on the core technology for smart glasses in 2008 and feel the ORA has a different value proposition,” said Optinvent’s CEO Kayvan Mirza in an email interview. He said that while Google Glass’s capabilities are similar to that of a smart watch, ORA is more like a full blown tablet. “The ORA can run AR applications, the display is three times the size of Glass, and can be positioned in two modes,” Mirza said, explaining why he feels the ORA will deliver a more compelling user experience. He claimed Ora does not suffer from issues like color rendering, low brightness and small field of view that plague other smart glasses and is also more scalable.
But what might prove to be the biggest selling point for Ora, however, is the price. The developer version is selling at $600, less that half the price of the Glass. “Yes, we are a start-up so we don’t have the same purchasing power as these giants. But we are still able to offer our product at a third of the price.  It gets even better; our consumer product has been announced for $300. That is because our core technology is by far the most cost effective to produce in volume,” said Mirza, who thinks the price has to become aggressive for these devices to become mainstream.
Incidentally, at IFA in Berlin Sony showcased its new smart Glass, which is a far cry from what continued…

Chinas carbon emissions have hit a new record  but its the next few years that matter mostChina's Transition
September 22, 2014
China now emits more greenhouse gases than the United States and the European Union combined —and, for the first time, emits more than the EU on a per capita basis . Those are sobering milestones ahead of the global climate summit in New York this week, where leaders will be pressuring China to rein in emissions. Over the past week, activists have held over  2,000 demonstrations  calling on countries like China to address climate change.

But China has already helped global emissions to grow a little more slowly. Last year, its total emissions grew 2.3% to 36.1 billion tonnes (39 billion tons), lower than the average yearly growth for the past decade of 2.5%, according to the report by the Global Carbon Project. That slight drop is mostly because of China’s economic slowdown, but it’s the country’s newly pledged “war on pollution” that could actually make a difference.
Growing public anger over China’s air and water pollution, as well as a new environmental law and focus on renewable energy, raise the possibility that Chinese leaders may finally be serious about tackling the country’s carbon emissions. “There is a popular mandate for cleaning up the environment. The point being that people aren’t going to take it anymore,” Charles Yonts, head of sustainable research at CLSA said at an investor conference last week.
The  new environmental law unveiled in April actually seems to have some real teeth: Officials in areas where plants are found violating environmental laws can be criminally liable, some non-governmental agencies are now allowed to sue polluting companies, and caps on environmental fines have been removed. In July, China fined 10 coal-fired power plants a total of 158 million yuan (about $25 million) for not removing sulfur oxide from their emissions.
Overall, China plans to reduce its reliance to below 65% of energy production, from 66% in 2012. Twelve of China’s 34 provinces have pledged some form of coal consumption reduction, ranging from coal reduction targets to negative growth targets, according to a report by Greenpeace in April. Ten Chinese provinces have already seen their absolute levels of coal consumption drop between 2011 and 2012 so that the growth rate of national coal consumption has at least started to fall:

Telecom M&A Guidelines Need to be Reworked: TRAI ChairmanManufacturing Growth May Moderate in December Quarter: Industry Body
New Delhi: With a view that the country cannot carry on with 12 telecom operators, sector regulator Trai today said current merger and acquisition (M&A) rules need to be reworked by the government for any pick up in consolidation activity.
"No jurisdiction in the world has 12 operators, mostly the countries have 5 or 4 telecom players and at some places 2. For this to happen (here) merger and acquisition guidelines have to be reworked," TRAI chairman Rahul Khullar said here.
The Chairman of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) said the guidelines have been a non-starter as M&A activity has not taken place despite the industry being in dire need for consolidation.
"I think the industry is in dire need of consolidation, its simply just cannot carry on like this with 10-12 operators, some of them bleeding to death and it has to stop," Mr Khullar said.
Telecom operators have long been demanding changes in the M&A rules, terming them difficult.
Vodafone India chief Marten Pieters had earlier said that companies should be allowed to buy assets of a particular firm such as spectrum and not the entire firm which has a lot of debt in its books.
Giving an example, Mr Pieters had said, "We love to buy 3G spectrum but for 3G spectrum, if I have to buy complete operator who has 3G spectrum ... It comes with all kinds of stuff I don't want because I have it all. So, it is very difficult to make an attractive proposition in such a situation."
Easing the M&A rules, the government had allowed mergers between firms with up to 50 per cent combined market share.
Earlier, telecom firms were allowed to merge if their combined market share in terms of subscriber base does not exceed 40 per cent in any of the nation's 22 circles or zones.

GMR inks pact with Nepal Govt for 900-MW hydel project
V Rishi Kumar
Tweet
Hyderabad, Sept 22:  
GMR Group has entered into a Project Development Agreement with the Nepal Government for the 900-MW Upper Karnali Hydro Power Project.
The agreement was signed late last week in the presence of Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, among others.
The project agreement was signed after due approvals from the Board of Investment Board of Nepal and the Nepal Cabinet. This is the largest FDI for Nepal and also the largest investment for GMR Group outside India.
The Upper Karnali Hydro Power Project was awarded to the GMR Group through an International competitive bidding process in 2008. The project entails an investment of about Rs 9,000 crore.
Located on Karnali river, in the Surkhet, Dailekh and Achham districts of Nepal, the 900-MW project is to be constructed in about five years.
The power generated, net of free power and power supply to Nepal, if any, is planned to be evacuated through a 400 kV double circuit transmission line up to the interconnection point of Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) in India.
G M Rao, Group Chairman of GMR Group, in a statement said, “The signing of the Project Development Agreement for the Upper Karnali Hydro Power Project reinforces the strong ties between India and Nepal. The development of the Upper Karnali project will be beneficial for both countries leveraging on each other’s strengths and resources. We are committed to the development of the project and the betterment of the communities in the region.”
The financial closure of the project (long-term tie-up of debt and equity capital) is expected to be achieved before September 2016 and thereafter the commencement of the commercial operation is expected by September 2021.
GMR Group will be exploring strategic/long-term capital tie-up of both debt and equity for the project at an appropriate time.
The project is expected to generate about 3,500 million units (MUs) of energy annually and 420 MUs of energy (12 per cent of installed capacity) has been earmarked as free power to Nepal.
The Nepal Electricity Authority will hold 27 per cent free equity stake in the project, including all project royalties, and the 100 per cent ownership of the project will be transferred to the Government of Nepal, at the end of the 25-year concession period.

USDA: Number of online food & grocery retail outlets in India risingUSDA: Number of online food & grocery retail outlets in India rising
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 22:  
The number of online food and grocery retail outlets has increased to 44 so far this year from 14 in 2013 on the back of growing Internet users in the country, a latest USDA report said.
Online retailers are competing with kirana stores that provide quick (often within an hour) home delivery and credit to neighbourhood consumers. Compared to these stores, online retailers will need to overcome delivery challenges, it said.
The majority of these online grocery retail outlets operate in Delhi, followed by Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Thiruvananthapuram, Coimbatore, and others.
“Online food and grocery retailing outlets have increased from 14 in 2013 to 44 as of September 2014. Growth in online retail use has been the greatest among the younger and professional population segments,” the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in its latest report.
The number of online grocery retail outlets is expected to rise in future with total Internet users increasing from 120 million to 213 million in the past year as well as a fall in mobile handset prices and a rise in smartphone penetration, it said.
Highlighting fast-changing trends in India’s online retail sector, the USDA report said: “Indian consumers are overcoming biases against purchasing items without prior inspection and safety of automated and online transactions. This shifting tendency is brought about by competitive pricing and the convenience of shopping for groceries from the comfort of one’s own home.”
Consumers find that online retail provides some benefits over going to kirana stores (independent small grocers) or store-based retailers’ outlets, it said.
The availability of multiple payment methodologies such as online banking, cash-on-delivery, credit cards and debit cards, have meant that it is convenient for urban consumers to shop online while saving both time and money, it added.
Emphasising the opportunities for continued growth in online grocery retailing, the report said, “Currently, most online retailers limit their distribution to a particular city. But, operations may expand quickly if some business models prove successful.”
Domestic products dominate the product categories, but most online retailers carry some imported food items. Given the complexity of importing food products into India, online retailers currently rely on local distributors, it said.
Web sites such as www.aaloo.in, www.eemli.com, www.fishvish.com, www.dilligrocery.com. www.tazastuff.com, and www.veggibazaar.com are among 44 sites that sell both domestic and imported food items in the country.

Amid seat-sharing tussle  Sena backs Modi for praising MuslimsAmid seat-sharing tussle, Sena backs Modi for praising Muslims
PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
Even as its alliance with BJP appeared teetering on the brink, Shiv Sena today endorsed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s praise for Indian Muslims, saying he has “initiated a new chapter by giving a guarantee of the community’s love for its motherland’’.
“Modi has lauded Indian Muslims for their patriotism. He has initiated a new chapter by giving a guarantee of the community’s love for its motherland. Now, Muslims must not let him down,” an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana” said.
The party, an ally of BJP for 25 years, however, said Modi’s praise of patriotism of Indian Muslims should not be seen as a dilution of his commitment to Hindutva.
“There is no reason to believe that Hindutva in Modi’s mind has been diluted just because he called Muslims patriotic,” the editorial said.
Asking Muslims not to let Modi down after he had shown immense faith in them, the Sena said, “As a Prime Minister, Modi represents people from all communities and there is no reason why he should be against a particular community. But, he has been always painted as ‘anti-Muslim’ by pseudo-secularists of the country.”
If some people are involved in terrorism, it doesn’t mean that every Muslim should be painted as a terrorist, the Sena mouthpiece said.
In an interview to a TV channel, Modi had said Indian Muslims will live and die for India and not dance to the tune of terrorist organisations like al-Qaeda.
Shiv Sena’s approval of Modi’s remarks on Muslims, despite its hardline Hindutva ideology, could be seen as an attempt to keep the Prime Minister in good humour amid the continuing stand-off over seat-sharing for the Maharashtra Assembly polls next month.
Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had yesterday made a “final offer” to its long-standing ally, saying while Shiv Sena would contest 151 seats, BJP 119 and the rest 18 would go to smaller allies in the 288-member Assembly. BJP had promptly rejected the offer.

In setback to Ranjit Sinha  SC to hear NGO s allegations against himSC agrees to hear charges against Ranjit Sinha without learning whistleblower's name
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Sep 22, 2014 01:55 PM IST
In a setback to CBI Director Ranjit Sinha, the Supreme Court today agreed to consider a plea for hearing allegations levelled against him without knowing the name of the whistleblower in a case relating to controversial entries in the visitors' diary at his residence.
A bench headed by Justice H L Dattu sought the assistance of the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP), appointed by it for trial in 2G cases, saying that any order passed by it may have ramifications on multi-crore scam cases.
The bench agreed to hear the plea of NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation, which pleaded for recall of its earlier order.
The court had asked the NGO to reveal the name of the whistleblower in a sealed envelope.
It turned down the plea of the CBI Director's counsel Vikas Singh that the apex court should not hear the case any further in view of the NGO refusing to disclose the name of "mole" who leaked the documents, including CBI file notings and the register.
Submitting that there has been no interference on his part in any of the cases probed by CBI, Sinha pleaded that continuance of this case even for a single day would cause more public harm and would affect 2G cases.
The bench, however, said, "We don't believe so."

I did not criticise Islam in Lajja : TaslimaNasrinPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 2:47 pm
Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin says she did not criticise Islam in her controversial novel “Lajja” and the fatwa against her is because of her criticism of the religion in many of her other books.
“Many believe that I have criticised Islam in ‘Lajja’ and the Muslim fundamentalists of Bangladesh have issued a fatwa against me – both untrue. I have not criticised Islam in ‘Lajja’ and the fatwa is not because of Lajja. The fatwa is because I have criticised Islam in many of my other books,” she says.
“‘Lajja’ can be seen as a symbol of protest. It is a protest against the violence, hatred and killings that are going on all over the world in the name of religion,” Nasrin writes in the preface of a new English translation of “Lajja” brought out as a special 20th anniversary edition.
The fresh edition, translated by activist-writer Anchita Ghatak, is published by Penguin Books India.
52-year-old Nasrin says “Lajja” will remain relevant as long as the incidents described in it continue to happen and as long as there is conflict between people of one religion and another.
According to her, “Lajja” does not speak of religion or hate, it speaks of humanity and love.
A savage indictment of religious extremism, “Lajja”, written in 1993, was banned in Bangladesh but became a bestseller in the rest of the world.
It tells the story of the Dattas who have lived in Bangladesh all their lives. Despite being members of a small Hindu community, they refuse to leave their country. But their world begins to fall apart after the demolition of the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.
Nasrin had to leave Bangladesh in 1994 in the wake of death threat by fundamentalist groups for her alleged anti-Islamic views.
She is now a citizen of Sweden. She has been getting Indian visa on a continuous basis since 2004.
She had been living in exile since 1994 and has lived in the US, Europe and India in the last two decades. However, on many occasions she had expressed her wish to live in India permanently, especially in Kolkata.
The writer had to leave Kolkata in 2007 following violent street protests by a section of Muslims against her works. Earlier this month, the Centre gave a one-year visa to Nasrin allowing her to stay in India till August 2015.
Nasrin says even today, the “politics of religion does not allow the subcontinent to become civilised” and its people to become truly educated.
“My book is primarily a testament to the savagery of religions in the Indian subcontinent. Relgion drives people to madness, at which point they do not hesitate to bandon even basic humanity.”
Some of her other works include “Dwikhondito”, “Oporpokkho”, “Amar Meyebela” and “Utal Hawa”.
Nasrin’s works have won her the prestigious Ananda Puraskar in 1992 and 2000.
She has been recognised with the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought from the European Parliament, the Kurt Tucholsky Award from the Swedish PEN, the Simone de Beauvoir Award and numerous other awards and doctorates.

70 Army installations hit by floods  LoC postsrelocatedArmy personnel rescue civilians at the Haft Chinar in Srinagar in Kashmir. (Source: Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)
Press Trust of India | Jammu | Posted: September 22, 2014 2:33 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 2:40 pm
Seventy Army installations, including camps, bunkers and posts, have been hit by the devastating floods in Kashmir Valley but security forces have swiftly relocated the damaged and washed out posts to plug the gaps in the sensitive border areas.
The installations were partially submerged or totally inundated in the floods but security forces managed to rescue all troops manning them.
“Floods have badly affected 30-40 camps, posts and bunkers in the hinterland which were meant for counter terrorism operations in Kashmir Valley”, a senior Army officer told PTI.
Similarly, 30 posts and bunkers have been badly affected along the LoC, while 10 to 15 bunkers were totally washed away, the officer said.
“But we acted swiftly. We relocated and restored the posts and bunkers immediately. We left no gaps in LoC due to the washed out of bunkers”, Officer said.
Maintaining that all troops were saved from the gushing waters in camps and formations, the officer said, “Only three causalities took place–two in boat capsize in Pulwama in Kashmir and one in landslide in Poonch. There bodies have been recovered”.
However, two minor ammunition dumps were affected,, he said, adding small stores and other ammunition have suffered losses.
Army is performing a dual role- one to reach out to the flood-hit people and the other saving its owns installations and men and guard the LoC with higher degree of vigilance.
“We performed both the roles excellently. We rescued 2.30 lakh flood-hit people, provided them relief, medicare facilities and shelter and also saved our men and ensured high degree of vigilance along the border”, the officer said.
“We did not lower our guard on the borders where we killed 10 militants in encounters during infiltration bids,” he said.
The Kashmir Army’s headquarter at Chinar Badamibagh was totally inundated and nearly 2000 troops were rescued by the IAF from the facility.
In Anantang town of South Kashmir, the Brigade headquarters at Khanabal was partially submerged and troops evacuated from there.
Over 40 km of the three-tier border fencing and flood-lighting have also been damaged by the floods.
With the Army expressing apprehension that militants might take advantage of the situation and infiltrate, work is going on round-the-clock to plug in the gaps on the fencing.
Jammu and Kashmir has 734 Kms of LoC running through Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh regions from Kargil to Malu (Akhnoor) in Jammu district, while it has 190 Kms of International Border from Malu to Punjab belt running through Jammu, Samba and Kathua continued…

US Fed rate hike not to impact EMs including India: Fitchcurrent account deficit
(Fitch has affirmed India's…)
NEW DELHI: The US Federal Reserve might just start raising interest rates by the middle of 2015 and that will surely have its impact on emerging markets, including India.
Higher US interest rates or expectation of that will definitely have some impact on emerging markets in the form of capital outflows. However, India appears more prepared to deal with external shocks, including a rate hike by the Fed, say analysts.
Fitch, which expects the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates by the middle of 2015, has recently done a various stress case scenario to ascertain the impact of the US Fed rate hike on emerging markets.
"The stress case, where the rise in interest rates was sharper and more disruptive than most people currently expect, pointed to a number of countries where this process might have a relatively larger impact on economic and financial stability based on a range of indicators, that included Ukraine," said Andrew Colquhoun, Senior Director & Head-APAC Ratings, Fitch, in an interview with ET Now.
"Hungary, Mongolia and potentially Turkey are more vulnerable as compared to other countries that showed less vulnerability, which included names like India as well as Vietnam and Brazil," he added.
Colquhoun stressed upon the fact that the stress test was only done for the kind of illustrative purposes and does not substitute for the rating process which obviously is based on a much broader range of indicators.
"For India, certainly the cycle is relatively favourable at the moment. We saw a strong 5.7 per cent growth number in the second quarter, which is relatively positive. More broadly though, that is coming off quite a low base recently and overall, we assess macroeconomic factors for India as a neutral element in its credit profile," he added.
Anytime the US Federal Reserve makes any interest rate decision, it is bound to affect emerging markets around the world, especially the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa).
"The reason is quite simple. When the US decides to raise interest rates, it lures investors around the world to shift their funds. The US has kept rates at 0% since 2008. So it would be a dramatic shift in monetary policy," said Raghu Kumar, Cofounder of RKSV.
"That being said, the RBI is taking the right approach by taking preventive actions. It has cut its current account deficit by more than half -- from $87.8 billion to $32.4 billion -- through curbs on gold imports and increases on other duties," he added.
With a stable rupee, a growing GDP and a revival in the markets, coupled with growing US dollar reserves through high FII inflows, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan stated it the best: "My sense is that even when the Fed withdraws, people, after an initial bout of withdrawal, may consider India a good place to leave their money," said Kumar.
India is moving towards much better fundamentals as compared to most emerging markets. Hence, it is likely that money will start moving out of other emerging markets and India might start getting more allocations.
"We think that the five factors, namely revival of the cape cycle, softening of inflation/rates, introduction of GST, greater financial savings and greater productivity, will make India one of the most attractive destinations to invest," said Devang Mehta, Sr. VP & Head - Equity Advisory, AnandRathi Financial Services.
Fitch outlook on India's rating:
The global rating agency thinks that reduction in the current account deficits since 2013 has consolidated India's rating at its current level of BBB minus with a stable outlook. Fitch was early to call the stabilisation in India's prospects when they reversed the outlook to stable from negative in the middle of last year.
Going forward, in terms of the possible further positive rating action, the two key areas that are holding the rating at the lower end of the BBB scale are public finances and microeconomic stability.
"Although it remains to be seen whether the economy can return to the kind of 8% growth rate to which we used to be before the financial crisis," said Colquhoun.
GDP growth of 5.7 per cent is impressive relative to recent performance, but that is a little less impressive relative to the pre-2008 performance. The second area is the public finances considering the fact that India's level of government debt and fiscal deficit remains higher than its peers.
So, a further reduction in the fiscal deficit and eventually declining government debt levels will certainly support the case for a future positive action.

BSE Sensex, Nifty Firm Up In Late Trade
NDTV | Updated On: September 22, 2014 14:45 (IST)
The Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
BSE Sensex and Nifty gained momentum in late trade with the indices rising over 0.3 per cent. The Sensex had struggled most of the session, falling nearly 0.65 per cent at its day's low.
However some late-session buying in auto, FMCG, banking and oil & gas stocks helped the Sensex and Nifty recover.
At 2:36 p.m., the Sensex was up 142 points to 27,234 while Nifty rose 32 points to 8,153.
Neeraj Dewan, director of Quantum Securities, said in recent times the markets have found support whenever there has been a dip, with buyers in the sidelines jumping in.
 

Crude oil falls below $98 on sluggish demand  ample supplyCrude oil falls below $98 on sluggish demand, ample supply
Reuters
Tweet
London, Sept 22:  
Brent crude fell below $98 a barrel on Monday, dropping for the third session in four, as sluggish demand and ample supplies outweighed expectations of a cut in oil output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
Comments from OPEC’s secretary general last week that the group could cut output next year buoyed Brent, but investors’ attention turned back to the gloomy economic outlook in Europe and China, which has curbed oil demand.
A cut in Libya’s oil output had limited impact on prices.
November Brent was 67 cents lower at $97.72 a barrel by 0835 GMT. US crude futures for October fell 50 cents to $91.91 a barrel, ahead of the contract’s expiry at the end of Monday.
“Sentiment remains predominantly bearish given downbeat demand growth expectations and plentiful supplies,’’ said Andrey Kryuchenkov, London-based oil and commodities strategist at Russian bank VTB Capital.
“However, I think the downside is limited,’’ he added.
“The market is very sensitive to supply jitters, given that the risk premium is gone and judging by the reaction last week to a fresh outage in Libya and OPEC comments.’’
OPEC members, many of whom require oil prices at above $100 to meet budgetary needs, will review the organisation’s oil output policy at its next meeting on November 27.
Libya oil production
Oil production in Libya has fallen to 700,000 barrels per day (bpd), down nearly 20 percent from 870,000 bpd a week ago as its El Sharara oilfield and Zawiya refinery stay closed, a spokesman for the state-run National Oil Corp (NOC) said on Sunday.
Fighting has intensified in southern Libya as soldiers and police clashed in the last few days near the country’s biggest oilfield El Sharara. The field was shut last week because of damage to a storage facility at the Zawiya refinery in the north, which it feeds.
But concerns over extended stagnation in Europe, that could pull down other economies, were highlighted at the G20 meeting in Australia on Sunday.
“We expect weak global demand for crude oil to have already been priced in, based on the drop in prices we have seen in the past few months. We believe it is very unlikely that prices would increase,’’ Phillip Futures said in a note to clients.
Investors will look for clues on where demand from China, the world's second-largest economy, is heading from its flash manufacturing PMI reading due out on Tuesday.

Sensex jumps 140 points; consumer durables  FMCG stocks steal the showSensex up 116 points; consumer durables, FMCG stocks steal the show
Our Bureau/Agencies
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the green amid weak European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex rose 116.32 points or 0.43 per cent at 27,206.74 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty gained 24.85 points or 0.31 per cent at 8,146.30.
Rajesh Agarwal, Head-Research, Eastern Financiers, in a report said: "Going forward, the Sensex earnings multiple at 17 times FY15 earnings looks a bit stretched, and investors would be better off being cautious as the near term upside looks a little difficult. Some reforms have taken place but the quantum of impact on the bottom-line of corporates needs to be seen. Hot money, lower crude prices, monsoon not turning out to be as bad as was earlier expected, are some of the factors that are driving the markets. While we believe that markets could witness correction in short-term, earnings expansion, government initiatives towards infrastructure and strengthening economic data, provide comfort on the medium-term. We strongly believe that the Government’s pro-growth approach will aid the revival in the economy and would in turn boost equity markets."
Among BSE sectoral indices, consumer durables, FMCG, auto and oil & gas indices were the star-performers and were up 3.12 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.88 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, metal index fell the most by 1.22 per cent, followed by healthcare 0.89 per cent and India infrastructure 0.87 per cent.
Tata Motors, ONGC, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and SBIN were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Cipla, BHEL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Infosys.
Concerns over a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday, while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners' shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 per cent, also took its toll.
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the weekend said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 347.48 at 10:02 a.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.6 per cent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts slid 0.5 per cent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.8 per cent.

Pakistans powerful spy agency ISI gets newchiefPrint
PTI | Islamabad | Posted: September 22, 2014 3:03 pm
Lt Gen Rizwan Akhtar, considered a close confidante of army chief Gen Raheel Sharif, was on Monday appointed as new head of Pakistan’s powerful spy agency ISI.
Lt Gen Akhtar was promoted as three star general and appointed Director General Inter-Services Intelligence as part of major reshuffle in the military, a development that would help Gen Sharif in consolidating his powers amid political instability in the country.
“Maj Gens Rizwan Akhtar, Hilal Hussain, Ghayur Mahmood, Nazir Butt, Navid Mukhtar, Hidayat Ur Rehman” were promoted to next ranks, Director General Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major Asim Bajwa wrote on Twitter. He also said Akhtar was appointed as to DGISI, Hidayat to Peshawar Corps commander, Mukhtar Karachi Corps Commander, Hussain Mangla Corps Commander, Mahmood Gujranwala Coprs Commander, Butt as chief of communication and Information Technology at GHQ.
Lt Gen Akhtar will take over from October 1 when the current ISI chief Lt-Gen Zaheerul Islam retirs along with four other lieutenant generals. Those retiring are Mangla corps commander Lt-Gen Tariq Khan, Gujranwala corps commander Lt-Gen Saleem Nawaz, Peshawar corps commander Lt-Gen Khalid Rabbani and Karachi corps commander Lt-Gen Sajjad Ghani. Technically and legally the ISI chief is appointed by the prime minister on the advice of the army chief but the former can seldom have his will. Usually the army chief sends a name to the prime minister as formality who had to approve it.
Earlier, it was reported that Maj Gen Naveed Mukhtar was also in the run for the top spy job.
Dawn reported that Akhtar is a graduate of the Command and Staff College in Quetta, National Defense University and the Army War College, USA.
He is from the Frontier Force Regiment and commanded the infantry brigade and infantry division in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).
Previously as Sindh DG Rangers, Maj Gen Akhtar had been assigned with the task to lead the Karachi operation. But the military had replaced him as DG Rangers Sindh with another senior military officer.
Akhtar is also considered to have extensive experience of counterinsurgency from a previous posting in the border region of South Waziristan.
“He has served in a place like Karachi while remaining neutral and apolitical and has extensive experience of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism. He was the obvious choice,” said a serving military official.
“He is a professional soldier who has experience of both Fata and internal security in Karachi,” an army official said.

Probing former FM Chidambaram s role in Aircel-Maxis deal: CBI to courtAircel
(CBI said it was investigating…)
NEW DELHI: The CBI on Monday told the special 2G court hearing the Aircel-Maxis case that the foreign investment promotion board's approval in the deal was a "mistake". The agency said it was investigating how former finance minister P Chidambaram Chidambaram had cleared the nearly Rs3,500-crore deal in 2006 as he was competent to give approval of up to Rs600 crore only.
"The investment was of $800 million which is Rs3,500 crore (approx). The FIPB approval (by the then finance minister) was a mistake. This is under investigation," the investigating officer in the case told Special Judge OP Saini. It said that the matter should have been referred to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).
"Your (judge) query was on FIPB approval. We are showing documents which show the power of the then finance minister. Power was vested in the then finance minister to give FIPB approval of up to Rs600 crore. For investment of over Rs600 crore, CCEA was competent to give approval. This is under investigation and we have not concluded the probe on this aspect yet," CBI prosecutor KK Goel said.
The agency had told the court in its chargesheet in the case that Mauritius-based M/s Global Communication Services Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Maxis, had sought approval for $800 million.
In its chargesheet, CBI had named former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi Maran, T Ananda Krishnan, Malaysian national Augustus Ralph Marshall and four firms —Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd, Maxis Communication Berhad, South Asia Entertainment Holding Ltd and Astro All Asia Network PLC — as accused in the case.
They have been charge sheeted for the offences punishable under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
On being asked by the court about the role of Kaveri Maran, wife of Kalanithi Maran who has been charge sheeted by the CBI in the case, the agency said that although she was holding 82% share in accused firm Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd but as per the documents, every decision was taken by her husband.
"Documents do not reveal about her role directly. If the court give us further task, we will certainly investigate this aspect," the CBI said. The court has now fixed the matter for further arguments on October 13. On September 11, the CBI had told the court that former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran had "pressurised" and "forced" Chennai-based telecom promoter C Sivasankaran to sell his stakes in Aircel and two subsidiary firms to Malaysian firm Maxis Group in 2006.
The Malaysian firm was favoured by Maran and granted licence within six months after the take over of Aircel in December 2006, it had said.
Ex-Telecom Secretary J S Sharma, who has died, has also been named in the CBI's chargesheet. However, his name has been put in a column of the accused against whom trial cannot proceed.

State-owned  Coal India (CIL) has so far entered into fuel supply pacts with 161 power units for a capacity of 73,675 MW.
"Out of 78,000 mw capacity as on date, CIL (Coal India Ltd) has signed 161 FSAs (fuel supply agreements) for a capacity of 73,675 MW," according to a Coal India document.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had earlier directed for coal supplies in respect of power projects worth 78,000 mw capacity, it said. As many as 172 FSAs are to signed in this regard.
The status of the pending 11 FSAs was reviewed in the meeting of the standing linkage committee held last month, it said.
As many as 177 LoAs (Letter of Assurances) were issued by the CIL and its subsidiaries for power projects to be commissioned during 11th and 12th Plan. The LoAs cover a capacity of about 1,08,000 mw projects, it added.
The coal ministry had earlier said that CIL is yet to enter into fuel supply pacts with some of the power units as issues like change in ownership and extension of coal supplies are still being examined by it.
Two deadlines set for the signing of FSAs by CIL with the power producers could not be adhered to. The government had set the deadline of August 31, 2013 for signing of the FSAs, which could not be met. The second deadline was set for September, last year.

Sell PNB on rallies: Phani Sekhar02:00 pm
Phani Sekhar, Fund Manager-PMS at Angel Broking told CNBC-TV18, "A good idea is not just for  Punjab National Bank (PNB) but in general for public sector banks will be to ride these trading rallies and have a horizon of two-three months, look at logging another 10-15 percent if they come and then bailout because if you take a longer term horizon one year and plus then this structural challenges seem to be very much intact and even if they get over the asset quality issues and if interest rates come down by 50 bps then Basel III issues will start bothering the market."
"So this is not a space for long-term investing but since the going is good right now and there are trading rallies from time to time in this space, the investor will be advised to ride the rally and get out, maybe Rs 100 from here and book profit," he added.

New Delhi, Sept 22:  
A complete clarity on the new price for domestically produced gas will emerge by September 30, a senior official of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas said on Monday.
“The report submitted by the senior official level panel has been discussed over the week-end and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs is now ready to take it up. There will be complete clarity on the gas price by September 30,” the official said.
The panel, which included the secretaries of Power, Fertiliser and Expenditure and Additional Secretary of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas as the empanelled secretary, had submitted its report last week.
It is expected that the new price of domestically produced gas will hover around $6/unit (gas is measured in million British thermal units).
The official declined to state whether the gas pricing issue will be taken up at the CCEA meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for the US visit on September 26, leaving little time for the CCEA to take up the matter.

London, Sept 22:  
Concerns about a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday, while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners’ shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 per cent, also took its toll.
The dollar, which last week racked up its 10th consecutive week of gains against a basket of currencies, its longest winning streak since the US currency’s free float in 1973, gave up ground against major rivals.
The euro traded 0.2 per cent higher at $1.2860, after touching a 14-month trough of $1.2826 in Asian trade, while the yen was almost flat at 109.04 to the dollar.
Signs of disagreement
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the week-end said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew cited “philosophical’’ differences with some of his European counterparts over the need for short-term stimulus.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble stressed the need for structural reforms and strict budget controls.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will speak in European Parliament on Monday, days after a lukewarm take-up of cheap loans under the bank’s latest scheme to push more money into the euro zone financial system.
The G20 finance leaders also warned of the potential for a build-up of excessive risk in financial markets in an environment of low interest rates and low asset price volatility.
Pulse of global economy
Investors will be able to take the pulse of the global economy on Tuesday when flash purchasing managers data on manufacturing and service sector activity is released.
“The psychological effect of a below-50 reading will be significant and consistent with the slew of softer Chinese data over recent weeks,’’ Mitul Kotecha, head of FX strategy Asia-Pacific for Barclays in Singapore, said in a note to clients.
However, the focus will be on the Chinese manufacturing index, which some analysts see falling below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst stock index was down 0.3 per cent at 1,395.45 points.
“Tesco has dealt investors a severe blow to confidence, with fellow food retailers also suffering," said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
“Concerns regarding China, comments from the finance minister and whether additional economic stimulus will be applied also appears to be hitting investor sentiment.’’
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped about 1.1 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei stock average ended down 0.7 per cent, after it marked its highest closing level since 2007 on Friday and gained 2.3 per cent last week.
On Friday, Wall Street ended broadly flat, despite the Dow Jones industrial average edging up to a second straight record, after a strong debut by Chinese internet company Alibaba was offset by falling technology stocks.
Chinese steel and iron ore futures hit record lows, down 4 per cent, plagued by excessive supply and demand worries.
Brent crude oil fell below $98 a barrel, hit by similar factors. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 1.4 per cent at $6,741 a tonne.

Exports growth slips to 5-month low in Augustexports
Due to restrictions on gold imports, gems and jewellery exports dipped by 10.31 per cent to $3.23 billion in August.
The growth rate of India’s exports slipped to five-month low of 2.35 per cent in August at $26.95 billion, pushing up the trade deficit to $10.83 billion.
Gold imports jumped significantly to $2.03 billion from $738.7 million a year ago.
Exporters body FIEO attributed the poor performance of exports to slowdown in European markets.
“The situation in EU is still bad. The exporters are waiting for the new foreign trade policy. We are expecting measures to boost exports,” FIEO President Rafeeq Ahmed said.
Trade deficit in August was the highest in the last four months. It was $10 billion in April when shipments had recorded a low growth of 5.26 per cent.
According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry data, overall imports grew only 2.08 per cent to $37.79 billion.
Exports in May and June had registered a growth of 12.4 per cent and 10.22 per cent, respectively. In July, export growth slipped further to 7.33 per cent.
For the April-August period exports have grown 7.31 per cent to $134.79 billion. Imports, however, have dipped by 2.69 per cent to $190.94 billion.
Trade deficit during the five months has reached $56.15 billion, lower than $70.6 billion in the year-ago period.
Oil imports declined by 14.97 per cent in August to $12.83 billion. However, non-oil imports were up by 13.82 per cent to $24.95 billion.
Due to restrictions on gold imports, gems and jewellery exports dipped by 10.31 per cent to $3.23 billion in August. Similarly, overseas shipments of electronic goods declined by 17.67 per cent to $547 million.
The other exporting sectors which recorded negative growth in August include tea, coffee, rice, tobacco, spices, oil meals, iron ore and petroleum products.
However, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and engineering exports registered a growth of 7 per cent, 2.66 per cent and 22.2 per cent, respectively.
As for imports, sectors which recorded negative growth include fertilizer, coal, petroleum, transport equipment, project goods and silver.

Franklin India Corporate Bond Opportunities: BuyTweet
It actively invests outside the triple-A rated bonds to maximise yields
If the ups and downs in interest rates have you bewildered, you can opt for bond funds that try to maximise interest receipts rather than make gains from bond prices.
Franklin India Corporate Bond Opportunities is one such fund that invests in bonds with different ratings, betting on the credit risk of its holding to earn commensurately higher interest.
The fund has outperformed its category average and benchmark since inception. The fund particularly takes an active call in the instruments that it invests in with half of its assets parked in AA-rated bonds. The fund delivered 11.4 per cent returns in the last one year, outperforming its benchmark by 100 basis points.
Consistent performer
The Franklin India Corporate Bond Opportunities Fund has delivered 10.6 per cent annualised return since its inception in December 2011. This is superior to the 9-9.25 per cent offered by banks for one-three-year deposits (best rate at 9.3-9.4 per cent). Even during the sudden rise in short-term interest rates during July-August 2013, the fund managed to cap its loss at 1.9 per cent. It has recovered smartly since September last year and delivered 11 per cent.
The fund takes an active call on the credit ratings of bonds. The fund has invested half of their assets in AA-rated bonds, and close to a third of its portfolio in instruments rated A or lower. Hence, the yield to maturity (YTM) for the fund has been in the 10.7 to 12 per cent range — higher by 40 basis points on an average when compared with other similar funds in the category, such as Birla Sun Life Medium Term and Birla Sun Life Short Term Opportunities. The strategy of the fund is to keep the average maturity below three years. The fund’s average maturity has been between 2.5 and 2.7 years.
Go for higher returns
In the recent Budget, the Finance Minister plugged the tax arbitrage between debt funds and fixed deposits. Capital gains on all non-equity mutual funds held for less than three years are taxed at the slab rate, similar to bank deposits.
Also, the tax on long-term gains arising out of debt funds is now fixed at 20 per cent with indexation.
With the tax differentials gone, investors can still opt for open-ended debt funds, provided they deliver better returns than bank deposits.
The scheme invests in debentures rated A to AA+ of companies such as JSW Steel, Tata Sky, Century Textiles and IL&FS Transportation, among others.

Alibaba raises $25 bn in world s biggest IPOAlibaba IPO world's biggest after additional shares sold

Alibaba Group Holding's initial public offering (IPO) now ranks as the world's biggest in history at $25 billion, after the e-commerce giant and some of its shareholders sold additional shares.
Overwhelming demand saw the IPO initially raise $21.8 billion and then send Alibaba's stock surging 38 per cent in its debut on Friday. "That prompted underwriters to exercise an option to sell an additional 48 million shares," a source with direct knowledge of the deal said.
The IPO surpassed the previous global record set by Agricultural Bank of China in 2010 when the bank raised $22.1 billion.
Under the option, Alibaba agreed to sell 26.1 million additional shares and Yahoo Inc 18.3 million, netting the two companies an extra $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion respectively.
Alibaba's Jack Ma agreed to sell an extra 2.7 million shares and company co-founder Joe Tsai agreed to sell 902,782 additional shares, according to the prospectus.
The source declined to be identified as the details of the additional sale have yet to be made official. Alibaba declined to comment.
Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley acted as joint bookrunners of the IPO.
Rothschild was hired as Alibaba's independent financial advisor on the deal.

Sierra Leone concludes nationwide Ebola lockdownEmpty streets are seen during a three-day lockdown to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus, in Freetown, Sierra Leone, Sunday, Sept. 21, 2014. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Sierra Leone | Posted: September 22, 2014 11:52 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 11:59 am
Frustrated residents complained of food shortages in some neighborhoods of Sierra Leone’s capital on Sunday as the country reached the third and final day of a sweeping, unprecedented lockdown designed to combat the deadly Ebola disease, volunteers said.
While most residents welcomed teams of health care workers and volunteers bearing information about the disease, rumors persisted in pockets of the city that poisoned soap was being distributed, suggesting that public education campaigns had not been entirely successful.
The streets of the capital, Freetown, were again mostly deserted on Sunday in compliance with a government order for the country’s 6 million residents to stay in their homes.

Spread by contact with bodily fluids, Ebola has killed more than 560 people in Sierra Leone and more than 2,600 across West Africa in the biggest outbreak ever recorded, according to the World Health Organization . The disease, which has also touched Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal, is believed to have sickened more than 5,500 people.
Sierra Leone’s government was hoping the lockdown — the most aggressive containment effort yet attempted — would turn the tide against the disease. There were rumors in Freetown on Sunday that officials would opt to extend the lockdown, but a Health Ministry statement issued Sunday night confirmed it had ended.
The statement said that 75 percent of the targeted 1.5 million households had been contacted by outreach teams, and that outreach would continue in “hot spots” around the country.
Health care workers had taken advantage of the lockdown to bury 71 dead bodies by Sunday morning, Health Ministry official Dr. Sarian Kamara said on a radio program. The bodies of dead Ebola victims are highly contagious, making safe burials essential to stopping the spread of the disease.
Sundays are usually quiet for residents in Sierra Leone, who go to church or stay at home with many businesses and restaurants closed.
In the city center, despite police efforts to encourage people to stay inside their homes, most families sat on their verandas chatting as radios blared through the streets. People were urged to stay tuned to their radios and televisions for public information on the lockdown.
The National Power Authority also provided uninterrupted electricity during the lockdown, so people didn’t have to rely on generators.

Google s new 9-inch Nexus tablet will be HTC made28
2
Bangalore: Google Inc has selected HTC Corp to make its upcoming 9-inch Nexus tablet, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Google had been mulling HTC as a potential Nexus tablet partner since last year and HTC engineers have been flying to the Googleplex in Mountain View in recent months to work on the project, the report said.
Google's decision to pick HTC reflects its long-term strategy of building a broad base of partners from device to device to prevent any one manufacturer from gaining a monopoly, the report said.

Arun Jaitley re-admitted to hospital for check-upPrint

Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 1:40 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 1:47 pm
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has been re-admitted to hospital for a post surgery check-up, his doctor said on Monday.
Jaitley, who had undergone a surgery to control diabetes earlier this month, was admitted last evening to Max hospital in Saket and is likely to be discharged on Tuesday.
According to sources close to the Minister, Jaitley is keeping fine but he is under observation.
All of Jaitley’s engagements, including the launch of an updated version of CBDT website, have been cancelled.
“Jaitley was admitted on Sunday at 6 pm for a planned routine follow-up for the assessment of his kidney functioning parameters,” said Dr Pradeep K Chowbey, Executive Vice-Chairman of Max Healthcare and Director of Max Institute of Minimal Access, Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.
The Minister also complained of a minor stomach infection, sources added.
Earlier this month, the 61-year-old BJP leader had undergone an elective laproscopic procedure for diabetes management. He was discharged on September 10.

Meet the 19-year-old developer who turned do...19-year-old John Meyer dropped out of a prestigious university computer science program to work full-time on his tech startup, Fresco News.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Last week, 19-year-old John Meyer dropped out of a prestigious university computer science program to work full-time on his tech startup, Fresco News. His parents weren't happy at first. He was attending NYU where his mom is a professor, he told Business Insider.
But they eventually came around to support him, because they had to admit: Meyer is already a successful independent computer programmer . He's been writing apps since his freshman year in high school, 2008, after teaching himself the programming language Objective C.
And he's been making money at it since his sophomore year of high school, he says.
"Money-wise, I've been pretty fortunate. I've been able to support myself since just a year after I got started," he said.
He's making so much money writing iPhone apps that during his first year of college he could afford to live alone, pay NYU tuition while bootstrapping Fresco, he told Business Insider. Fresco News is a sort of intersection between Instagram, Twitter and Flipboard that turns photos from ordinary people on the scene of big news events into news stories.
We pressed him to reveal his income but promised not to share it. Let's just say it's on par with what software engineers earn at some of the best tech companies.
Despite his young age, Meyer's app portfolio is impressive. He's written about 40 apps, mostly through his app company TapMedia, he says.
This includes the popular iPhone 4 flashlight app Just Light (which may have been the very first flashlight app). It went nuts, downloaded about 2 million times, he said. Apple now includes a flashlight app with the iPhone.
He's just had another huge hit called Perfect Shot, too, released about a year ago for iOS 7. It was downloaded 60,000 times in the first four days and is now at over 1 million, he says.
It uses the smile and eye detection features in the iPhone camera for taking the perfect group photo. Hold the phone up and wait. The app takes the shot in the perfect millisecond when everyone is smiling, no one is blinking. A very smart idea.
So smart, that Meyer nabbed the attention of Apple. The company asked him to become an intern, he says. That's a dream come true for most students. And it pays. Apple interns can make $5,723 a month.
But he turned Apple down.
"I get emails from recruiters all the time, and this past summer an offer to intern at Apple," he says. But, he explains,"I am, at heart, an entrepreneur. I won't be happy working for someone else."
He's not worried about missing the chance of a lifetime. "If I wanted to, I'm sure they would offer me another internship," he says.
That's not just the bravado of being 19. "I've been close with a lot of people at Apple, from going to Apple's developer conference every year," he says. "I'm in a field where I've done a lot of things already, an expansive portfolio of projects I've worked on."
He's actually been attending the developer's conference since he was 16, sneaking in the first time with his dad's help. His dad flew him to San Francisco, registered himself for the conference, then handed the pass to his son to attend.
"I was 16 and anyone under 18 wasn't allowed. It was right after the successful flashlight app. My dad got the ticket from Apple, flew back home and left me in San Francisco," he laughs.
Since then, Apple has created a teen program at the conference he says. It's been great for meeting other programmers his age, he says.
If all that wasn't impressive enough, Meyer was also a finalist in the Thiel Fellowship, he says. That's a program by billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel in which gifted young people drop out of school to start companies. Only 40 people become finalists, flown to the Valley for mingling. 20 are accepted, and Meyer wasn't one of them.
That doeesn't bother him at all. He's focused on turning Fresco into a money maker, talking to potential clients for it like New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
And he hasn't ruled going back to college some day. But for now, he's writing apps for fun and profit.

Saradha scam: CBI questions Congress MP Abu Hasem Khan10

Kolkata: The Central Bureau of Investigation team probing the multi-crore Saradha scam interrogated Congress MP Abu Hasem Khan Chowdhury on Monday.
In 2011, the Congress MP had written a complaint to the then PM Dr Manmohan Singh against key accused Sudipta Sen and his company. However, in 2012 Chowdhury withdrew his complaint stating that his earlier complaint was based on 'misrepresented facts' which were later brought to his notice.
In the withdrawal letter Chowdhury gave a clean chit to the Sen's company. A year after his withdrawal, the  group collapsed. The CBI is probing the reason behind Chaowdhury's change of mind.

Press Trust of India | Jammu | Posted: September 22, 2014 2:33 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 2:40 pm
Seventy Army installations, including camps, bunkers and posts, have been hit by the devastating floods in Kashmir Valley but security forces have swiftly relocated the damaged and washed out posts to plug the gaps in the sensitive border areas.
The installations were partially submerged or totally inundated in the floods but security forces managed to rescue all troops manning them.
“Floods have badly affected 30-40 camps, posts and bunkers in the hinterland which were meant for counter terrorism operations in Kashmir Valley”, a senior Army officer told PTI.
Similarly, 30 posts and bunkers have been badly affected along the LoC, while 10 to 15 bunkers were totally washed away, the officer said.
“But we acted swiftly. We relocated and restored the posts and bunkers immediately. We left no gaps in LoC due to the washed out of bunkers”, Officer said.
Maintaining that all troops were saved from the gushing waters in camps and formations, the officer said, “Only three causalities took place–two in boat capsize in Pulwama in Kashmir and one in landslide in Poonch. There bodies have been recovered”.
However, two minor ammunition dumps were affected,, he said, adding small stores and other ammunition have suffered losses.
Army is performing a dual role- one to reach out to the flood-hit people and the other saving its owns installations and men and guard the LoC with higher degree of vigilance.
“We performed both the roles excellently. We rescued 2.30 lakh flood-hit people, provided them relief, medicare facilities and shelter and also saved our men and ensured high degree of vigilance along the border”, the officer said.
“We did not lower our guard on the borders where we killed 10 militants in encounters during infiltration bids,” he said.
The Kashmir Army’s headquarter at Chinar Badamibagh was totally inundated and nearly 2000 troops were rescued by the IAF from the facility.
In Anantang town of South Kashmir, the Brigade headquarters at Khanabal was partially submerged and troops evacuated from there.
Over 40 km of the three-tier border fencing and flood-lighting have also been damaged by the floods.
With the Army expressing apprehension that militants might take advantage of the situation and infiltrate, work is going on round-the-clock to plug in the gaps on the fencing.
Jammu and Kashmir has 734 Kms of LoC running through Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh regions from Kargil to Malu (Akhnoor) in Jammu district, while it has 190 Kms of International Border from Malu to Punjab belt running through Jammu, Samba and Kathua continued…

PayPal mafia  the richest group of men in Si...Meet the PayPal mafia, the richest group of men in Silicon Valley

The company founded by Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and Max Levchin has spawned three billionaires , many, many millionaires, and generation-defining companies. Here, we break down the key players from the most notorious group in Silicon Valley .
These men can afford to both laugh off our criticism and buy several new wardrobes. For they are the 'PayPal Mafia' and between them, these 13 men are worth billions and billions of dollars. And to be fair to them, they were styled as faux gangsters for the 2007 Fortune magazine shoot that birthed their infamous moniker.
Mick Brown recently met PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel for an extraordinary Telegraph Magazine feature . The vast success enjoyed by Thiel and his former colleagues got us thinking: how did one company breed such a remarkable crop of entrepreneurs and capitalists? Discover exactly who the PayPal Mafia are.
1. Jawed Karim
Role in PayPal: Designed and implemented PayPal's incendiary real-time anti-fraud system, among other key components of the business.
After PayPal: Karim, Chad Hurley (designer of PayPal's first logo) and Steve Chen (another PayPal colleague and early Facebook employee) founded a video sharing site in 2005. They named it YouTube. Soon after developing the fledgling site, Karim enrolled at Stanford University where, despite having already displayed a certain acumen in this area, he chose to study computer science.
He continued to act as an advisor to YouTube before cashing in 137,443 shares of stock (worth a cool $64 million) when Google purchased YouTube for $1.65 billion in November 2006. Now 35, Karim launched a business called Youniversity Ventures in 2008 aimed at helping students and graduates develop business ideas with early PayPal investors Kevin Hartz and Keith Rabols.
Estimated net worth: $140 million
2. Jeremy Stoppelman
Role in PayPal: Joined PayPal as an engineer whilst it was known as X.com, eventually becoming the Vice President of Engineering.
Post-PayPal: Resigned soon after PayPal was picked up by eBay for $1.5 billion in 2003, taking a year to attend Harvard Business School. Inspired whilst poorly with flu and finding it tricky to find decent doctor recommendations, he and a former colleague Russel Simmons dreamed up the idea for online reviews site Yelp in 2004 and convinced former PayPal Chief Technology Officer Max Levchin to put up $1 million in initial funding.
Steve Jobs convinced him to reject Google's acquisition offer in 2010 and in 2012, Yelp became a public limited company. But it's not been a smooth recent few years: Yelp reviewers leaving negative reviews have faced legal action from affronted businesses and the site's faced accusations of handing positive reviews to advertisers.
Estimated net worth: $111-$222 million
3. Andrew McCormack
Role in PayPal: Joined in 2001, working closely as an assistant to Peter Thiel as the company prepared for its initial public offering (IPO)
After PayPal: Helped set-up another Thiel venture, hedge fund company Clarium Capital before founding a restaurant group in San Francisco. Currently a partner at venture capital firm Valar Ventures, he found his way back to Thiel in 2008 to join Thiel Capital via corporate development roles at eCount (now part of US banking conglomerate Citigroup) and Yahoo!.
Estimated net worth: Unknown
4. Premal Shah
Role in PayPal: Spent six years at the company as a product manager.
After PayPal: Became President of non-profit organisation Kiva, which allows people to lend money to struggling entrepreneurs and students in over 70 countries via the internet. Founded by former programmer Matt Flannery and his businesswoman ex-wife Jessica Jackeley, the site was raising around $1 million every three days by November 2013.
Estimated net worth: Unknown

China Slowdown Worries Hit World Stocks, Commodities
Reuters | Updated On: September 22, 2014 14:54 (IST)
The Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
London: Concern about a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners' shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 percent, also took its toll.
The dollar, which last week racked up its 10th consecutive week of gains against a basket of currencies, its longest winning streak since the US currency's free float in 1973, gave up ground against major rivals.
The euro traded 0.2 per cent higher at $1.2860, after touching a 14-month trough of $1.2826 in Asian trade, while the yen was almost flat at 109.04 to the dollar.
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the weekend said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew cited "philosophical" differences with some of his European counterparts over the need for short-term stimulus.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble stressed the need for structural reform and strict budget controls.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will speak in the European Parliament on Monday, days after a lukewarm take-up of cheap loans under the bank's latest scheme to push more money into the euro zone financial system.
The G20 finance leaders also warned of the potential for a build-up of excessive risk in financial markets in an environment of low interest rates and low asset price volatility.
Pulse
Investors will be able to take the pulse of the global economy on Tuesday when flash purchasing managers data on manufacturing and service sector activity is released.
"The psychological effect of a below-50 reading will be significant and consistent with the slew of softer Chinese data over recent weeks." Mitul Kotecha, head of FX strategy Asia-Pacific for Barclays in Singapore, said in a note to clients.
However, the focus will be on the Chinese manufacturing index, which some analysts see falling below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst stock index was down 0.3 per cent at 1,395.45 points.
"Tesco has dealt investors a severe blow to confidence, with fellow food retailers also suffering," said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
"Concerns regarding China, comments from the finance minister and whether additional economic stimulus will be applied also appears to be hitting investor sentiment."
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped about 1.1 per cent. Japan's Nikkei stock average ended down 0.7 per cent, after it marked its highest closing level since 2007 on Friday and gained 2.3 per cent last week.
On Friday, Wall Street ended broadly flat, despite the Dow Jones industrial average edging up to a second straight record, after a strong debut by Chinese internet company Alibaba was offset by falling technology stocks.
Chinese steel and iron ore futures hit record lows, down 4 per cent, plagued by excessive supply and demand worries.
Brent crude oil fell below $98 a barrel, hit by similar factors. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 1.4 per cent at $6,741 a tonne.

Indefinite strike in Meghalaya from Tuesday against NGTs coal miningbanThe ban was issued following a complaint by the All Dimasa Students’ Union of the adjoining Dima Hasao district of Assam, which contended that rat-hole mining in Meghalaya had polluted the Kopili river. Source: PTI
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: September 22, 2014 3:17 pm
Four months after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered a ban on ‘rat-hole’ coal mining in Meghalaya, an organization called Movement for Indigenous Peoples’ Rights and Livelihood-Meghalaya (MIPRL) has called for an indefinite economic strike from Tuesday demanding withdrawal of that order.
The NGT had on April 17 issued orders to the state government to immediately stop rat-hole and other illegal coal mining, as also transportation of coal extracted through such methods. The ban was issued following a complaint by the All Dimasa Students’ Union of the adjoining Dima Hasao district of Assam, which contended that rat-hole mining in Meghalaya had polluted the Kopili river and turned its water poisonous.
While this ban has been opposed by various organizations including political parties on the ground that it had affected livelihood of thousands of people out of job, the MIPRL also complained against lack of response from the Meghalaya government to this major economic issue.
MIPRL spokesman Erwin K Syiem Sutnga said in Shillong that while said that the group had submitted a list of ten issues to the Meghalaya chief minister with a 10-day deadline, there was no response from him. “The state government even failed to make any proper presentation during the NGT’s hearing on September 16 despite demand by so many organizations to it to pray for relaxation of the guidelines,” he said.
The MIPRL has also demanded implementation of Para 12 A Sub Para (b) of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India to protect the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo Peoples’ inalienable and absolute rights over tribal land. Its other demands included modification of all central laws applied to the state of Meghalaya done without recourse to the mandatory provisions of Para 12 A Sub Para (b) and (d).
“The government of Meghalaya continues to play with the lives and survival of thousands of people who have bee rendered jobless. We had no option left but to call an economic strike,” Sutnga said.
The MIPRL has asked all transporters of goods in and outside Meghalaya, all petroleum product tankers, limestone exporters and traders, all passenger transporters, carriers, transporters of timber, cement, clinker and coal, among others, to support the economic strike call. The strike will however not affect private and small commercial vehicles within Meghalaya, Sutnga said. It would also not affect schools, colleges, offices, markets, he added.
Meanwhile, an expert committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has permitted transportation of coal already extracted before issue of the ban order, but under strict 21-point environmental guidelines continued…

The GMR  Group today said it has signed a Project Development Agreement for 900 MW Upper Karnali Hydro Power project with the Nepal government. The cost of the project is estimated to be around USD 1.5 billion.
The agreement, which is a major milestone for the project, was signed on Friday after due approvals of the Board of Investment Board of Nepal and the cabinet of Government of Nepal, a statement from GMR said today.
It said this is the largest FDI for Nepal and also the largest investment for GMR Group outside India. The Upper Karnali Hydro Power project was awarded to the GMR Group through an International competitive bidding process in 2008 on BOOT basis. The project, with a capacity of 900 MW, is being developed as an export-oriented project to be constructed in a period of about 5 years.
The project is located on Karnali river in the Surkhet, Dailekh and Achham districts of Nepal. G M Rao, Group Chairman of GMR Group, said the signing of the project development agreement for the Karnali Hydro Power project reinforces the strong ties between India and Nepal.

Srinagar: Seventy Army installations, including camps, bunkers and posts, have been hit by the devastating floods in Kashmir Valley but security forces have swiftly relocated the damaged and washed out posts to plug the gaps in the sensitive border areas.
The installations were partially submerged or totally inundated in the floods but security forces managed to rescue all troops manning them.
"Floods have badly affected 30-40 camps, posts and bunkers in the hinterland which were meant for counter terrorism operations in Kashmir Valley", a senior Army officer said.
The installations were partially submerged or totally inundated in the floods but security forces managed to rescue all troops manning them.

Similarly, 30 posts and bunkers have been badly affected along the LoC, while 10 to 15 bunkers were totally washed away, the officer said.
"But we acted swiftly. We relocated and restored the posts and bunkers immediately. We left no gaps in LoC due to the washed out of bunkers", Officer said.
Maintaining that all troops were saved from the gushing waters in camps and formations, the officer said, "Only three causalities took place--two in boat capsize in Pulwama in
Kashmir and one in landslide in Poonch. There bodies have been recovered".
However, two minor ammunition dumps were affected, he said, adding small stores and other ammunition have suffered losses.
Army is performing a dual role- one to reach out to the flood-hit people and the other saving its owns installations and men and guard the LoC with higher degree of vigilance.
"We performed both the roles excellently. We rescued 2.30 lakh flood-hit people, provided them relief, medicare facilities and shelter and also saved our men and ensured high degree of vigilance along the border", the officer said.
"We did not lower our guard on the borders where we killed 10 militants in encounters during infiltration bids," he said.

ISRO successfully test-fires liquid engine on MangalyaanISRO successfully test-fires liquid engine on Mangalyaan
PTI
Tweet
Bangalore, Sept 22:  
In a crucial manoeuvre ahead of India’s Mars orbiter’s entry into the final destination on September 24, the main liquid engine on the spacecraft was today successfully test fired and its trajectory corrected.
The 440 Newton Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) engine, idling for the last 300 days on the Mars Orbiter Mission, was fired for four seconds, raising the confidence level of ISRO about the success of insertion of the spacecraft into the Martian orbit.
“Main Liquid Engine test firing on Mars orbiter spacecraft successful: We had perfect burn for 4 seconds as programmed. The trajectory has been corrected. Mars Orbiter Mission will now go ahead with the normal plan for Mars Orbit Insertion,” said ISRO.
The success came even as MOM today entered the Mars Gravitational Sphere of Influence.
“Our navigators’ calculations show that MOM has entered the Gravitational Sphere of Influence of Mars,” ISRO said.
The spacecraft was within 5.4 lakh km radius of the Mars’ Gravitational Sphere of Influence, it said. On a 666 million km journey, the spacecraft escaped the earth gravity pull on December 1 last.
In the last lap on September 24, the orbiter has to be slowed down from 22.1 km per second to 4.4 km per second in relation to the red planet to be captured by the Martian orbit. The engine would be fired for 24 minutes on that day to reduce its velocity and insert it into the Martian orbit.
ISRO has already uploaded commands to help the spacecraft automatically enter the orbit. The mission’s success will make India the first country in the world to go to Mars in the maiden attempt.
As India’s MOM was on course to its destination, US NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft began orbiting Mars today.

Spectrum scarcity slowing broadband speeds: DoT to PMODoT to PMO: Spectrum scarcity slowing broadband speeds
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 22:  
The Department of Telecom has told the Prime Minister's Office that lack of adequate spectrum was the primary reason for slow broadband speeds in the country. The DoT said while mobile operators in other countries have 20-30 Mhz spectrum on an average, in India telecom companies operate with 5-10 Mhz only.
“The demand for new subscriptions is going on increasing day by day. With the advent of new bandwidth hungry applications, sale of smartphones, the scarcity of spectrum has become all the more glaring,” DoT said in a report prepared for the PMO. The PMO had asked DoT to spell out the reasons for low broadband speeds in the county. While countries such as Japan and the US have Internet connections offering as much as 100 mbps, in India users get an average of only 512 kbps.
DoT has said policy should be designed to make available adequate spectrum for mobile operators. This includes a favourable mergers and acquisition norm that encourages consolidation. Spectrum trading and sharing are the other means to ensure that operators have access to spectrum. However the report does not talk about getting agencies like the Defence forces to vacate spectrum. For example, the armed forces has 15 Mhz of spectrum in the 3G band which is lying idle. If this is vacated, operators will get access to more bandwidth.
There are 251 million Internet users in the country, 99 per cent of whom access the Web on mobile devices. Only 14 million users access the Internet using the wireline medium.
DoT has also said location of servers outside the country by major content providers could also be slowing down Internet speeds. It said policies that incentivise Web hosting locally should be put in place.

Dubai real estate market stabilises: reportDubai real estate market stabilises: report
PTI
Tweet
Dubai, Sept 22:  
Driven by tighter government regulations and an increasing mismatch between consumer and seller expectations, Dubai’s real estate market is now experiencing a period of stability, according to a report.
“The Dubai real estate market saw a welcome levelling-off during the summer months. The broad based recovery witnessed in the residential sector over the past 18 months has now slowed down, as rental prices and sale values have stabilised in most locations,” Head of Research at JLL MENA Craig Plumb said in the report released by real estate investment and advisory firm JLL.
While new projects continue to be announced, these have no immediate impact on supply as they are phased over a longer timeframe, Plumb said.
“Although the hotel sector underperformed over the month of July, registering 50 per cent occupancy rates, it is expected to trend upwards into the peak season in the last quarter of the year. Elsewhere in the market, the retail segment maintained its solid growth while the recovery of the office sector remains patchy, as high levels of supply continue to constrain the market,” he said.
The Dubai Real Estate Market Overview report released by leading real estate investment and advisory firm JLL provides the consultancy’s perspective on the latest trends in the office, residential, retail and hotel sectors in the emirate.
Driven by tighter government regulations and an increasing mismatch between buyer and seller expectations, the residential sector is now experiencing a welcomed period of stability, the report said.
The third quarter of 2014 continued to see a two-tier office market, says the report. While prime CBD rents have remained stable over the quarter, they are expected to increase as demand remains strong for Grade A office space.
Meanwhile, rents in secondary locations are expected to remain under downward pressure as more Grade A office space enters the market by 2015.
On the demand side, corporates are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of sustainability and there is heightened interest for LEED certified buildings.
The report showed, while property values in Dubai have increased over the past year, the third quarter saw more subdued growth levels in both apartment and villa sale prices and rents.
Average rents and sale prices grew by just 2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively in Q3, down from 3 per cent and 6 per cent in Q2.

India successfully test fires Mars Orbiter engine as mission enters red planetsspherePrint
ISRO said the spacecraft was within 5.4 lakh km radius of the Mars' Gravitational Sphere of Influence. (Source: Reuters/file)
Written by Johnson T A | Bangalore | Posted: September 22, 2014 3:49 pm | Updated: September 23, 2014 8:14 am
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Monday reported that a key engine on board its Mars Orbiter Spacecraft , which is currently within striking distance of the Red Planet, had been successfully test-fired .
The test-firing of the main liquid engine of the spacecraft sets the stage for its insertion into the orbit of Mars on September 24. The engine, known as the Liquid Apogee Motor, needs to fire for 24 minutes on Wednesday for ISRO to successfully dock the spacecraft in an orbit around Mars at a nearest distance of 423 km.
ISRO tested the LAM engine with a new valve to supply the fuel.
The engine had been lying idle since December 1, when it was fired for 21 minutes, sending the spacecraft on the final leg of its 666 million km journey to Mars.
Monday’s exercise was intended as a test of the functioning of the dormant engine as well as a new fuel supply route in the engine. It also involved a small course correction measure to take the spacecraft closer to Mars.
The firing of the engine on Monday for around four seconds was intended to slow down the spacecraft by around 2.14 metres per second and set it up at a distance of 515 km from Mars ahead of the final capture into the orbit on September 24 at 7.30 am.

On Wednesday, the engine will fire again for about 24 minutes, imparting a deceleration force of 1098.7 metres per second to enable the spacecraft to slip into an orbit with a nearest distance of 423 km to the Red Planet and a farthest distance of 80,000 km. The manoeuvre will consume 249.5 kg of the 280 kg fuel on board the spacecraft.
Failure of the engine to fire on Monday would have forced ISRO to adopt plan B, wherein eight small thrusters on the spacecraft would have been fired to enable it to dock into the orbit of Mars. However, it would not have been as close to the planet, and would have consumed the entire 280 kg of fuel.

“If the trajectory correction manoeuvre is not carried out, the spacecraft would arrive at a distance of 723 km from the surface of Mars ahead of the September 24 manoeuvre. With the correction, it will reach at a trajectory of 513 km,” ISRO scientific secretary V Koteswara Rao said.
ISRO’s Rs 450 crore Mars mission, launched on November 5, 2013 on board the PSLV-C25 rocket, is one of the cheapest voyages undertaken by any space faring nation. If successful, it will put ISRO among a league of three other agencies that have achieved success on missions to Mars.
The spacecraft is scheduled to enter the orbit of Mars exactly 48 hours after NASA’s 16th successful Mars mission with its Maven spacecraft on Monday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will be in Bangalore on Wednesday, is scheduled to visit ISRO’s mission operation centre in Peenya to congratulate scientists if the mission goes according to plan. Modi, who witnessed the successful launch of five foreign satellites on the PSLV-C23 rocket from the Satish Dhawan space centre at Sriharikota on June 30, had said at the time that he was waiting eagerly for the successful outcome of India’s Mars mission.
Indian space scientists are banking on a successful Mars mission to push ahead more ambitious programmes, like a maiden manned space flight and a manned moon mission. The ongoing Mars mission is intended to study methane on the Red Planet and look for possible signs of life there.

Probing Chidambarams role in Aircel-Maxis deal: CBI tocourtPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 3:25 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 3:28 pm
On Monday, the CBI told the special 2G court hearing the Aircel-Maxis case that the FIPB approval given by former Finance Minister P Chidambaram in the deal was a “mistake”.
“The investment was of 800 million USD which is Rs 3,500 crore (approx). The FIPB approval (by the then Finance Minister) was a mistake. This is under investigation,” the Investigating Officer in the case told Special Judge O P Saini.
The agency said it was investigating as to how Chidambaram had given foreign investment promotion board (FIPB) approval in the Aircel-Maxis deal in 2006.
It contended that Finance Minister was competent to give approval of upto Rs 600 crore but Chidambaram gave the approval which was worth 800 million USD, approximately Rs 3,500 crore.
It said that the matter should have been referred to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) and they are probing as to how Chidambaram gave the approval.
“Your (judge) query was on FIPB approval. We are showing documents which show the power of the then Finance Minister.
Power was vested in the then Finance Minister to give FIPB approval of upto Rs 600 crore.
“For investment of over Rs 600 crore, CCEA was competent to give approval. This is under investigation and we have not concluded the probe on this aspect yet,” CBI prosecutor K K Goel said.
The agency had told the court in its chargesheet in the case that Mauritius-based M/s Global Communication Services Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Maxis, had sought approval for USD 800 million for which CCEA was competent to do so.
In its chargesheet, CBI had named former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi Maran, T Ananda Krishnan, Malaysian national Augustus Ralph Marshall and four firms — Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd, Maxis Communication Berhad, South Asia Entertainment Holding Ltd and Astro All Asia Network PLC — as accused in the case.
They have been charge sheeted for the offences punishable under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
On being asked by the court about the role of Kaveri Maran, wife of Kalanithi Maran who has been charge sheeted by the CBI in the case, the agency said that although she was holding 82 per cent share in accused firm Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd but as per the documents, every decision was taken by her husband.
“Documents do not reveal about her role directly. If the court give us further task, we will certainly investigate this aspect,” the CBI said.
The court has now fixed the matter for further arguments on October 13.
On September 11, the CBI had told the court that former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran had “pressurised” and “forced” Chennai-based telecom promoter C Sivasankaran to sell his stakes in Aircel and two subsidiary firms to Malaysian firm Maxis Group in 2006.
The Malaysian firm was favoured by Maran and granted licence within six months after the take over of Aircel in December 2006, it had said.
Ex-Telecom Secretary J S Sharma, who has died, has also been named in the CBI’s charge sheet. However, his name has been put in a column of the accused against whom trial cannot proceed.
The 72-page charge sheet includes the names of 151 CBI witnesses and a set of 655 documents, on which the agency has relied upon in its investigation.

BSE sensex
(The index is now close to…)
NEW DELHI: With the US Federal Reserve uncertainty out of the way, the Indian markets are well placed to surpass their previous record highs on both the Sensex and the Nifty in the next few trading sessions.
Both the Sensex and the Nifty touched their respect record highs on September 8, 2014. The S&P BSE Sensex' record high is placed at 27354.99 and the life high of the 50-share Nifty index is placed at 8180.20.
Fresh buying and a bout of short-coverings helped the Nifty cross the 8,100 mark this week. The index is now close to its all-time high and the momentum suggests that the Nifty will soon hit a fresh high.
Fitch Ratings on Monday also said that US Fed interest rate hike - which could be expected by mid-2015 - will not cause a major disruption in emerging markets (EMs), including India. According to Fitch, India's credit profile is much stronger than other EM peers.
According to experts, valuations of the Indian markets are still not very high. Nifty P/E is at 16, which is substantially lower than its high of 25.
"Since May, I have stood by my forecast of the Sensex hitting 30,000 by the year of 2014. We can expect some slowdown in the markets in the first quarter of 2015 as FII inflows come to a standstill and the US raises its Federal Funds rate," said Raghu Kumar, Cofounder of RKSV.
"I would expect a quarterly growth of 3-5 per cent, which would pin the Sensex at around 31,500 by the end of March and 35,000 at the end of the 2015," he added.
We have collated a list of five less-known stocks where brokerages have initiated coverage in the month of September. These stocks have the potential to deliver up to 63 per cent return in the next 12-18 months:
Kitex Garments: Target Price set at Rs 615
Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on the Kochi-based stock with a 'buy' recommendation. The stock has already rallied nearly 500 per cent so far in the year 2014.
The company is in the business of manufacturing and exporting infant garments. It derives 85 per cent of its revenue from the sale of infant garments and the balance 15 per cent from the sale of fabric to Kitex Childrenwear.
KTG is in the process of adding some large clients in FY15 apart from deepening business with existing clients like Gerber, Toys R Us, Jockey, Mothercare and Carter's.
"Going forward, KTG intends to improve its revenue mix in favor of high margin clients like Toys R Us, Jockey and Mothercare, who procure high value-added products which will drive continued margin improvement," the report said.
"We expect KTG to post a 24.6 per cent revenue CAGR coupled with a 700bp margin expansion over FY14-FY17E. Hence, we expect PAT to post 40 per cent CAGR over FY14-17E. With 60 per cent capacity utilization currently, we expect ramp-up of existing capacities and minimal expansion capex," the report said.
"Given strong balance sheet and significant free cash flows, RoCE and RoE should improve from 37 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively, to 58 per cent and 39 per cent over FY14-17E," the report added.
 
Pennar Industries Ltd: Target price set at Rs 81
Midcap steel company Pennar Industries is in a strong bull run. The stock has surged over 140 per cent so far in the year 2014 and the rally is set to continue as the economic activity picks up, say analysts.
IndiaNivesh sees immense potential in the stock in the next 12 months. They value the stock at a conservative PE multiple of 10x to FY16E EPS (Rs. 8.1), which gives the target price of Rs 81.
Steel products business is expected to grow to more than Rs 450 crore in FY15. The company is expecting double-digit growth in the railways business in FY15. As of now, the railways business has an order book of Rs 120 crore.
All verticals of the company are generating positive cash flows and the management is confident of increasing cash profits in FY15 vs the previous fiscal.
According to the brokerage, corporate action by the company on getting subsidiary (PEBS) separately listed on exchanges could be the additional trigger. Pennar Industries is trading at P/E multiple of 8.8x FY15E and 5.9x FY16E earnings estimate, which is well below 14.3x - three-year historical average.
"Average ROE for the company in the past three years has been 12.9 per cent. In FY15E and FY16E, the ROE of the company is likely to improve to 16.4 per cent and 20.3 per cent respectively on the back of increased capacity utilization and margin expansion," the report said.
Century Plyboard: Target price set at Rs 156
Century Plyboard (CPBI) is India's leading plywood producer with the highest volume and revenue. CPBI and Greenply dominate the organised plywood market with a combined 50% market share. CPBI commands 5 per cent premium over its nearest brand and 20% premium over products of unorganised companies.

Hong Kong students on strike in democracy battle...and
versions
HONG KONG (AP) — Thousands of Hong Kong college and university students boycotted classes Monday to protest Beijing's decision to restrict voting reforms, the start of a weeklong strike that marks the latest phase in the battle for democracy in the southern Chinese city.
The strike comes as dozens of the city's tycoons and business leaders paid a rare group visit to Beijing to meet with China's communist leaders, who want to bolster support from Hong Kong's pro-establishment billionaire elites for the central government's policies on the semiautonomous city.
Student organizers are dismayed over Beijing's decision in August to rule out open nominations for candidates under proposed guidelines for the first-ever elections for Hong Kong's top leader, promised for 2017.
Discontent over democratic reform is especially acute among Hong Kong's young people, who worry about their prospects amid widening inequality they blame on billionaire tycoons whose companies control vast parts of the economy and who have Beijing's ear.
The National People's Congress, China's legislature, insists election candidates be vetted by a committee. Many of the tycoons visiting Beijing are part of a similar body that selects Hong Kong's leaders.
Hong Kong's democracy battle has led to increasing tension and division, with activists threatening to stage a mass "occupation" of the Asian financial hub's central business district as early as Oct. 1 as part of a civil disobedience campaign to press their demands.
China took control of the former British colony in 1997, agreeing to let it keep civil liberties unseen on the mainland and promising that the leader can eventually be chosen through "universal suffrage." But Beijing's insistence on screening candidates for patriotism to China has stoked fears among democracy groups that Hong Kong will never get genuine democracy.
"The student strike will mark the turning point of the democratic movement," Alex Chow, secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, told about 13,000 students from 24 schools rallying at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's suburban campus. "We will not have illusions in the government anymore, but we'll have faith in ourselves. We are willing to pay the price for democracy."
Students plan to gather daily for the rest of the week in a downtown park next to government headquarters. A smaller group of high schoolers plans to join the strike on Friday.
"Preselected candidates by a controlled nominating committee can only represent vested interests, but not the general public," Chow said. He urged Hong Kong's government to respond to demands for public nominations and to reform the legislature.
"If we hear nothing from them, the students, the people will definitely upgrade the movement to another level," Chow said.
About 380 academics and other school staff have signed a petition supporting the students, saying they should not "stand alone."
"At the minimum, they (the strikers) can provide a wakeup call to tens of thousands of university and secondary school students in Hong Kong," said Dixon Sing, a political science professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology who helped start the signature campaign. The organizers are "trying to inspire many other fellow classmates to be aware of and be devoted to the democratic movement," he said.
In Beijing, more than 60 Hong Kong tycoons, including Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest person, met with President Xi Jinping. It's only the second time such a big delegation has visited Beijing since the 1997 handover. In 2003, a similar entourage made the trip after a huge protest against unpopular legislation.
The tycoons urged democracy activists to avoid a confrontation, saying Beijing won't change its mind.
"Hong Kong is a financial center, and if the main financial district is messed up, then Hong Kong will be ruined," billionaire property developer Lee Shau-kee told reporters after arriving in Beijing on Sunday night.

LONDON (AP) — Tesco, the world's second-largest supermarket chain after Walmart, has suspended four executives and launched an accounting investigation after admitting that its half-year profit was overstated by 250 million pounds ($407 million).
The scandal deepens the financial woes for the British company, which on Monday had to issue its third profit warning in two years as it struggles to compete with low-cost rivals. The announcements shocked investors, with shares plunging 11.6 percent to 203 pence at market close Monday. The problems have driven the company's stock down 46 percent in the past year.
The investigation, prompted by information from a whistleblower, comes less than a month after the new chief executive, Dave Lewis, was brought in to turn around the company's business.
"We have uncovered a serious issue and have responded accordingly," Lewis said in a statement.
Lewis took over from Philip Clarke after the company issued a profit warning at the end of August. At the time, Tesco said it expected to report "trading profit" of about 1.1 billion pounds for the six months ended Aug. 23. The retailer now plans to release its earnings for the period on Oct. 23, three weeks later than previously scheduled.
Tesco has long dominated the supermarket industry in Britain, but has recently been squeezed by aggressive cost-cutting competitors such as Lidl and Aldi.
The company, which last year was the world's second largest food retailer after Walmart when measured by revenue, said the overstatement of profits resulted from reporting commercial income too early and delays in booking some costs. The company asked audit firm Deloitte to begin an independent review, along with the group's external legal advisers.
Lewis stressed in an interview with the BBC that the decision to ask employees to stand aside was not an indication of guilt or that disciplinary action was warranted. He declined to speculate on what he might discover, but described it as a single incident.
"This is about getting to the bottom of a full and frank inquiry of what happened," he said.
The company does not have a chief financial officer at the moment. Alan Stewart begins work in December.
Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said the development is flabbergasting.
"Such an announcement is not the stuff of a well operated FTSE-100 organization."
Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy Conlumino, said that while mistakes happen, it gives the impression of a company which is not fully in control of internal procedures.
"More significantly, it means that performance — which is already extremely weak — is actually much weaker than anticipated," he said. "This is something that will alarm investors and means that Tesco has much further to travel to recovery than first thought."

Affluence eludes poor crowding into Asian cities...and
versions
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Down a concrete path, between rail tracks that buzz with each approaching train and a river choked by plastic and raw sewage, Asih Binti Arif cradles her baby and reflects on dreams gone dark.
Five years ago, Arif and her husband left impoverished Madura Island, joining the stream of migrants from across the vast Indonesian archipelago seeking a better life in its capital.
Across the developing world, migration from country to city has long been a potential path out of poverty. Less and less is that true for Arif and millions of others in Asia, where the wealth gap is growing in many of the most densely populated cities in human history.
Experts say the trend could worsen as a widening gulf between the richest and everyone else undercuts efforts to reduce poverty, bringing a litany of problems: poorer health, less education, more family breakups, crime and unstable societies.
"With inequality, the impact of growth on poverty eradication is muted," said Indu Bhushan, an Asian Development Bank official.
Against the backdrop of gleaming office towers and luxury hotels, Arif's family lives in the sprawling Tanah Abang slum. They scavenge the garbage of those who can afford to discard plastic bottles, cardboard boxes and frayed clothes.
"I can't even dream of that life," Arif said. "The gap is so big. They are in the sky and we are on the earth."
Asia's ultra-rich, with their private jets, yachts and platoons of servants, are matching if not outdoing their counterparts elsewhere in the world, inviting famous pop stars to perform at their birthday bashes, building their own museums and collecting mansions.
Rising industries such as online commerce have made some business mavericks enormously wealthy. Most of Asia's richest, however, are second- and third-generation beneficiaries of family fortunes.
In past decades, the power of industrialization allowed hundreds of million to emerge from extreme poverty.
In 1981, nearly 1.7 billion Asians were living on less than $1.25 a day. Today, the figure is about 700 million.
But vast numbers cannot aspire to rise much further. About 80 percent of the 3.6 billion people in developing Asian countries still live on less than $5 a day, many relying on day labor, rag picking or other meager livelihoods.
Even migrants who arrived in cities years ago feel trapped in a seemingly permanent underclass.
In chaotic Mumbai, India's financial capital, Pandurang Bithobha Salvi, 52, is a veteran migrant from Naganwadi, a village 500 kilometers (300 miles) away in Maharashtra state.
Salvi and 20-odd men share the $130 a month rent on their 17-square-meter (180-square-foot) room festooned with drying shirts and pants. Sleeping arrangements are a nightly conundrum. Despite India's ascent as a center for business outsourcing, migrants like Salvi can only find low-paying work.
Across town on the tony Altamount Road, billionaire Mukesh Ambani and his family luxuriate in an expansive 400,000-square-foot (37,000-square-meter) super home.
Three years ago, Ambani moved into the purpose built 27-story tower with its three helipads, a movie theater, a two-story recreation center and a reported price tag of more than $1 billion.
It is one of the world's most expensive residences in a city where 40 percent of 20.7 million people live in slums without basic sanitation such as toilets.
"In the past, some of us have made a better life for ourselves and our families," said Salvi. "But such cases are becoming rarer now."
Using a scale of zero to 100, where zero means everyone has exactly the same wealth and 100 means a single person has all the wealth, Indonesia's inequality score rose to 41.3 in 2013 from 30.8 in 1999. Such sharp increases, which reflect wealth concentrating in fewer hands, have occurred in India, China and elsewhere, too.
The challenges are acute for countries such as Myanmar that are latecomers to industrialization.
A treasure land of gems and timber, Myanmar's economy stagnated for decades under generals who yielded power in 2011.
The economic reforms since then are transforming the skyline of its biggest city, Yangon, but not the lives of people like Thein Tun Oo and his wife Thin Thin Khaing, whose extended family of 10 ekes out a living from a one-room bamboo shack perched on the muddy banks of a creek.
Thein Tun Oo wagered everything in moving five years ago to Yangon from Bago, a region 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the north. There is little to show for the effort.
Asked what will come of Myanmar's reforms, including plans for factory parks that might provide better-paying jobs, Thin Thin Khaing and her husband burst out laughing.
"We don't know about such things," she said. "We work a day and eat a day."
In Indonesia, the increasing ostentation of the wealthy is a potential lightning rod for social strife.
Socialite Amanda Subagio, whose father founded a telecommunications and satellite empire, said the flaunting of extravagant wealth is deepening dissatisfaction among poor Indonesians.
"You should be at least aware of how other people are living in this country," she said.
The "other people" are those like Arif, the scrap collector in Jakarta's slum, and her neighbor, Samia Dewi Baturara, who share the same shack divided by a plywood wall.
Unlike Arif, Baturara still allows herself to dream.
As she peddles coffee from a stall opposite the luxury Shangri-La hotel, Baturara stares at the windows and pictures herself as part of the exclusive world inside. She would have to work 40 days, without spending a penny, to be able to afford just one night in the cheapest room.
"Almost every day, I imagine how I can sleep there."

The world stood up against climate change. More than  300,000 people marched in Manhattan  to demand cuts to global carbon emissions in the run-up to Tuesday’s United Nations climate summit. Al Gore and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon were among those present  at the People’s Climate March, part of coordinated demonstrations that took place in about 160 countries .
Islamic State threatened the West. In a video message posted to Twitter, a spokesman for the group called on Muslims to kill “disbelievers” in the US and allied countries , including France and Canada. “You will not feel secure even in your bedrooms,” said Abu Muhammed al-Adnani.
Tesco made a $400 million accounting mistake. The UK’s largest grocer  overstated expected profits by £250 million—the latest in a series of missteps that has resulted in five straight years of sales decline. Four executives including the company’s UK managing director have been suspended; Tesco shares dropped by as much as 12%.
Siemens bought into the US fracking boom. Europe’s largest engineering company is paying $7.6 billion for Dresser-Rand Group , a US manufacturer of oil and gas compressors and turbines.

Afghanistan finalized a power-sharing deal. Ashraf Ghani, the certified winner of a disputed election earlier this year, will be president . His defeated rival, Abdullah Abdullah, will nominate a chief executive with powers similar to those of a prime minister.
Yemeni rebels seized the capital. Power-sharing negotiations are underway after a Shiite militia took control of government buildings and military bases in Sana’a. Sunni governments in the region believe the group, known as the Houthis, is backed by Iran.
Quartz obsession interlude
Kabir Chibber on why Apple fans are converts to the appeal of bigger phones. “Demand for phablets is the fastest growing segment of mobile devices. So much so that Dan Frakes, the former senior editor of Macworld, decided to get the biggest iPhone ever made. ‘I think that in the past, we truly believed that the idea of a huge phone was silly,’ Frakes wrote. ‘But many of us, for a lack of better phrasing, have evolved—and so has the hardware.’”  Read more here .
Matters of debate
India is wrong about Uber. An unaccountable regulator is holding the country back .

Accumulate Suprajit Engineering on correction: Surjit Arora
According to Surjit Arora, Research Analyst-Institutional Equities at Prabhudas Lilladher, one can accumulate Suprajit Engineering on any correction.
Post your opinion here
Halftime Report
Surjit Arora, Research Analyst-Institutional Equities at Prabhudas Lilladher told CNBC-TV18, "The management of Suprajit Engineering  is quite focused on getting new orders from new customers. Recently they have also made an inroad into BMW supplies globally. So that is a big thing for a company which has Rs 1,500 crore marketcap. Historically also their return on equity has been quite stable at 25-26 percent with asset turn of almost four times the fixed asset. So, given the strong balance sheet and given that cash flow generation has been quite healthy and given the earning CAGR of 27-28 percent again driven by two-wheelers as well as on car side because from BMW and Volkswagen, all are giving new orders to Suprajit."
"The revenue visibility in this company is like 22 percent CAGR for next two-three years in terms of revenue and given that high operating leverage and cost cutting, I believe bottomline growth could be as high as 28 percent. So valuations are demanding at 18 times FY16 but it has slightly longer term view when you look at FY17. From a one year point of view valuation are still at 13-13.50 times one year forward and given the robust 28 percent CAGR in earnings with 26-27 percent return on equity, this company has lot to surprise on the positive side and give investors return to a tune of 25-30 percent over a next 12-15 months timeframe," he said.
"We are recommending clients to accumulate this stock on any corrections going forward. We are quite positive."
Disclosure: Analyst has been recommending the stock to his clients and might have holdings in the stock.

Buy Gabriel India at lower levels: Surjit Arora
Surjit Arora, Research Analyst-Institutional Equities at Prabhudas Lilladher is of the view that one can buy Gabriel India at lower levels with a target of Rs 100.
Post your opinion here
Halftime Report
Surjit Arora, Research Analyst-Institutional Equities at Prabhudas Lilladher told CNBC-TV18, "It has been quite a steep run up for Gabriel India  compared to other companies in our coverage, but there is couple of pointers, one is their commercial vehicle plant which is currently utilising the capacity at only 40 percent has been beaten down due to the downturn in medium heavy commercial vehicles segment. However, we feel that for next couple of years we have already seen the bottoming place in terms of commercial vehicle sales and going forward their could be 25-30 percent kind of growth in FY16 and FY17 for commercial vehicles."
"So given that the utilisation will improve with improvement in overall volumes, their margin profile will improve substantially given that commercial vehicles (CV) have higher margins for them. If you look at the company per se, their overall capacity utilisation on the blended basis, their blended utilisation is hardly at 60-65 percent, so the operating leverage will be quite high in this company. So, even if a 15-16 percent CAGR in toplines given both four-wheelers as well as two-wheeler will grow in that particular range, the operating levels will kick in with higher utilisation capacity plus they have cut down their debt because of higher profitability and lower working capital requirement," he said.
"Going forward, with 16 percent topline growth because of operating levels could be as high as 24 percent and because debt has been reduced substantially from Rs 140 crore to almost Rs 54-55 crore now, I believe there will be lot of savings on the interest cost front also. So that will translate almost in 32 percent CAGR in earnings for next two-three years. But having said that, in our report also we clearly mentioned that given the steep run up in the stock, we would advice clients buying into a stock at some correction in the stock, not at Rs 80. Lets say at 8-10 percent correction from hereon, given the steep run up, we would be buyers in the stock and hence we did not give a buy on this and we maintained an accumulate rating given that run up has been quite steep."
He further said, "It is more of an operating level story compared to LG Balakrishnan  which is more of a structural sustainable story with higher market share. Gabriel has 75-80 percent market shares. So they are the leaders there. However on the two-wheeler front they have lot of competition and being an original equipment (OE) supplier, their margins from 7 percent at best might go to 9-10 percent. So, they will not benefit in terms of double digit margins going forward because their margins are already were at 7 percent, I believe there could be substantial improvement from 7 percent to 9 percent over next two years. So the earnings growth and the cash flows generation will be quite healthy at least for the next couple of years."
"At lower levels one can definitely look at Gabriel India with a target price at Rs 100 which gives 25-30 percent upside from the current levels," he adds.

Clarity on gas pricing to emerge by this month-end: Petroleum Ministry officialComplete clarity on gas price to emerge by this month-end: Petroleum Ministry official

New Delhi, Sept 22:  
A complete clarity on the new price for domestically produced gas will emerge by September 30, a senior official of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas said on Monday.
“The report submitted by the senior official level panel has been discussed over the week-end and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs is now ready to take it up. There will be complete clarity on the gas price by September 30,” the official said.
The panel, which included the secretaries of Power, Fertiliser and Expenditure and Additional Secretary of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas as the empanelled secretary, had submitted its report last week.
It is expected that the new price of domestically produced gas will hover around $6/unit (gas is measured in million British thermal units).
The official declined to state whether the gas pricing issue will be taken up at the CCEA meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for the US visit on September 26, leaving little time for the CCEA to take up the matter.

Sensex up 105 points; consumer durables  auto stocks steal the showSensex up 116 points; consumer durables, FMCG stocks steal the show
Our Bureau/Agencies
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the green amid weak European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex rose 116.32 points or 0.43 per cent at 27,206.74 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty gained 24.85 points or 0.31 per cent at 8,146.30.
Rajesh Agarwal, Head-Research, Eastern Financiers, in a report said: "Going forward, the Sensex earnings multiple at 17 times FY15 earnings looks a bit stretched, and investors would be better off being cautious as the near term upside looks a little difficult. Some reforms have taken place but the quantum of impact on the bottom-line of corporates needs to be seen. Hot money, lower crude prices, monsoon not turning out to be as bad as was earlier expected, are some of the factors that are driving the markets. While we believe that markets could witness correction in short-term, earnings expansion, government initiatives towards infrastructure and strengthening economic data, provide comfort on the medium-term. We strongly believe that the Government’s pro-growth approach will aid the revival in the economy and would in turn boost equity markets."
Among BSE sectoral indices, consumer durables, FMCG, auto and oil & gas indices were the star-performers and were up 3.12 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.88 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, metal index fell the most by 1.22 per cent, followed by healthcare 0.89 per cent and India infrastructure 0.87 per cent.
Tata Motors, ONGC, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and SBIN were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Cipla, BHEL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Infosys.
Concerns over a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday, while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners' shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 per cent, also took its toll.
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the weekend said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 347.48 at 10:02 a.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.6 per cent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts slid 0.5 per cent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.8 per cent.

SC agrees to hear charges against Ranjit Sinha without learning whistleblower s nameSC agrees to hear charges against Ranjit Sinha without learning whistleblower's name
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Sep 22, 2014 01:55 PM IST
In a setback to CBI Director Ranjit Sinha, the Supreme Court today agreed to consider a plea for hearing allegations levelled against him without knowing the name of the whistleblower in a case relating to controversial entries in the visitors' diary at his residence.
A bench headed by Justice H L Dattu sought the assistance of the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP), appointed by it for trial in 2G cases, saying that any order passed by it may have ramifications on multi-crore scam cases.
The bench agreed to hear the plea of NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation, which pleaded for recall of its earlier order.
The court had asked the NGO to reveal the name of the whistleblower in a sealed envelope.
It turned down the plea of the CBI Director's counsel Vikas Singh that the apex court should not hear the case any further in view of the NGO refusing to disclose the name of "mole" who leaked the documents, including CBI file notings and the register.
Submitting that there has been no interference on his part in any of the cases probed by CBI, Sinha pleaded that continuance of this case even for a single day would cause more public harm and would affect 2G cases.
The bench, however, said, "We don't believe so."

Make in India  campaign to target 10% growth in manufacturing'Make in India' campaign to target 10% growth in manufacturing
Amiti Sen
DIPP has identified 3,000 companies across 30 countries and 10 sectors which it plans to attract
New Delhi, Sept 20:  
The 'Make in India’ campaign to be launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week will aim at pushing manufacturing growth to over 10 per cent annually.
The BJP Government aims to do so through sustained measures of deregulation and delicensing of industry and making India more accessible to investors by addressing the queries and concerns on a regular basis.
“We want to get rid of the impression that India is an unfriendly country to deal with. We will aim to make the going as easy for investors as possible,” an official from the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) said.
The DIPP has identified 3,000 companies from 30 countries spread across 10 sectors which it would target for greater investments through sustained dialogue as part of the campaign, a Government official said.
The sectors include automobile, pharmaceutical, food processing, IT, electronics and textiles.
The campaign, to be launched on September 25, will see participation from CEOs from big companies, including Japanese and Korean.
Three-layered process
In order to ensure all the queries and concerns of investors are addressed to their satisfaction, the DIPP has decided to address them systematically through a three-layered process.
Simple queries will be answered through the automatic answering process already in place. More complex queries will be handled by a team of eight experts put in place by the DIPP which includes economists and legal experts.
Questions that require fine interpretation of policy will be tackled by nodal officials who have been put in place in all ministries and departments, while more elaborate queries will be handled by the DIPP Secretary.
Delicensing, reregulating
The campaign will also focus on delicensing and reregulating. The Centre, recently, delicensed defence production and is also doing so in construction activity. However, a lot needs to be done at the State-level, the official said. “The DIPP is holding talks with State Governments on how they can smoothen things at their end,” the official pointed out.
There will be a "vigorous'' digital campaign undertaken by the DIPP to advertise the efforts to attract more investments.
However, officials admit, that achieving a growth rate over 10 per cent for manufacturing is an ambitious target, especially with the sector not doing well at present. “The target is ambitious but we do not have an alternative. Manufacturing has to grow fast for our economy to do well,” the official said.

Commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman had to miss the G-20 official reception after she lost her luggage containing her formal clothes en route to Cairns, Australia, on board an Air India (AI) flight .
The Air India ground handling staff had offloaded her luggage at Melbourne airport, an intermediate stop of the Delhi-Melbourne-Sydney flight, which she had boarded.
Sitharaman tweeted at 3.26 am, "Landed in Sydney to take a connecting flight to Cairns. My checked-in luggage not traceable." In another tweet an hour later she said, "On board my connecting flight to Cairns. All my formal wear in the lost suitcase! Not sure I can buy saris in Cairns! Situation precarious!"
The luggage was restored to Sitharaman 10 hours later after she took to Twitter to report the loss. "At last, my lost luggage arrives. Thanks every one for your wishes. Thanks Air India. Oh yes, relief first to get the phone and iPad chargers!" she tweeted.
Sitharaman's personal secretary called up the office of civil aviation minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju as he failed to get help from the AI staff in Sydney. The incident occurred despite AI deputing a sizeable number of employees at Sydney airport. A spokesperson for the national carrier told MAIL TODAY, "The luggage has been restored to the minister. Sitharaman had taken the flight that had a stopover at Melbourne before she disembarked at Sydney. From Sydney, she took a connecting flight to Cairns."
Sitharaman, who is also the minister of state for finance, is in Cairns to attend the two-day meeting of the G-20 finance ministers and Central bank governors. She could not attend the evening reception, organised in honour of the guests. She is attending the meet as Union finance minister Arun Jaitley had undergone treatment for diabetes.

Snowden fatigue is spreading abroadComments
By Stewart Baker September 20
If you think Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald have stopped attacking NSA, you haven’t been following them closely enough. While American media have largely lost interest in Snowden and Greenwald, the pair continue to campaign outside the United States against the intelligence agency.
Their most ambitious effort was in New Zealand, a member of the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance with the U.S. and U.K. The center-right New Zealand government has been embroiled in accusations of illegal surveillance of Kim Dotcom, who grew wealthy running a file-sharing site and is now fighting extradition to the United States for copyright violations. As part of that fight, Dotcom dove into New Zealand’s national elections, hoping to unseat the two-term government and, in his words, “to close one of the Five Eyes .”
Snowden and Greenwald dove in with him, joining eagerly in campaign events sponsored by Dotcom . Greenwald used his new Omidyar-funded news site to release a lengthy article in the last week of the campaign; it accused New Zealand of working with NSA to conduct mass surveillance. When the prime minister denied the accusation, Snowden called him a liar .
The combination of carefully timed Snowden leaks and Dotcom’s millions looked potent. Dotcom even funded a new Internet Party, aligned with the small Mana party, which already had a seat in New Zealand’s Parliament.
Well, New Zealanders went to the polls today, and the results are in .
The biggest losers? Snowden, Greenwald, and Dotcom.
The prime minister whom Snowden accused of lying won an “overwhelming” victory that may give him the first outright majority for any New Zealand party in nearly twenty years.
Meanwhile, Dotcom’s Internet Party bombed, even costing its tiny ally the only seat it held in Parliament.

Planning Commission Replacement Must be  Lean and Thin : EconomistCommercial Mining of Coal to be Allowed After Auction: Finance Minister
New York: A replacement for the Planning Commission must be "lean and thin", a top Indian-American economist has said, even as he listed fiscal consolidation, and trade and FDI liberalisation, as key areas the government should focus on to return to high growth.
Arvind Panagariya, Professor of Economics at Columbia University, termed as "brave" the decision by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to do away with the 1950-dated institution and said the body that takes its place should start "anew".
Addressing a gathering at the Chazen Institute of International Business here, he suggested that Mr Modi should put in "as lean and thin a team" for the planning body's replacement with 10-12 people and "lots of resources so that they can draw on the experts as necessary" and then periodically that team should meet with the Prime Minister and Finance Minister.
He further said the new body should have "in the background enough research agenda (on) how to design the reforms taking into the account the political economics".
Mr Panagariya, however, cautioned that the replacement of the Planning Commission should start "anew" as reforming the existing one would ultimately have the "same players" and that "needs to get changed".
Discussing the policy package that India should put in place to revive growth, he said a "reform menu" for
the country should include fiscal consolidation, trade and foreign investment liberalisation, amendment in the Land Acquisition Act, labour market reforms, privatisation and decentralisation of higher education.
He said while fiscal consolidation is underway, some movement has also happened in foreign investment under the new government which has opened the defence sector up to 49 per cent and insurance from 26 per cent to 49 per cent.
He, however, said that in his view, the government could have opened the insurance sector even more for foreign investment. Mr Panagariya also pointed out that there is need to reform the labour market as many of the labour laws are "incredibly constraining".
Making a strong case for amending the Land Acquisition Act, the economist said the act is "incredibly draconian".
"If everything under the current law goes smoothly, (there are) no challenges by NGOs, courts, it will still take five years (to acquire land). Nobody will dare initiate land acquisition under those circumstances."
He listed infrastructure development and privatisation as key areas that require immediate government attention.
On higher education, he expressed pessimism and said the sector seems to be going in the wrong direction.
"Indian system is highly centralised. What India needs is decentralisation" in the education sector, he added.
Mr Panagariya further said while these are the set of reforms that need to be done, there are issues that can go wrong and "implementation" is the key problem.
While Gujarat as a state succeeded by improving governance and controlling corruption, "at the Centre, we need policy changes", the economist added.

Mars mission enters last lap; crucial test on September 240
0
New Delhi: India's first mission to Mars will attempt to put a spacecraft in orbit around the red planet next week, in a crucial test of a low-cost project carrying the country's hopes to join the leaders of a global space race.
A successful outcome for the $74-million mission would stiffen Prime Minister Narendra Modi's resolve to build new space launch facilities capable of handling heavier satellites, to make India a stronger player in the space technology market.
Launched last November, the Mars Orbiter Mission, called Mangalyaan, aims to study the planet's surface and mineral composition, and scan its atmosphere for methane, a chemical strongly tied to life on Earth.
ISRO has already uploaded commands to help the spacecraft automatically enter orbit on the morning of September 24.
#mars orbiter mission #india #narendra modi #isro
If the spacecraft does manage to enter orbit around Mars on September 24, India would become the first country to succeed on its first try. European, US and Russian probes have managed to orbit or land on the planet, but only after several attempts.
"Confidence is high," V Koteswara Rao, scientific secretary at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), said. "All the operations done so far are successful and all the parameters measured are normal."
ISRO has already uploaded commands to help the spacecraft automatically enter orbit on the morning of September 24.
Two days before that, scientists will run a four-second test of a main engine that has been idle for about 300 days, and make a small course correction, Rao said.
However, experts say it will be challenging to get the trajectory right and cut the craft's speed from its current rate of 22 km (13.7 miles) per second to allow it to enter orbit. So also would be the task of receiving the faint signals it emits.
"It's like hitting a one-rupee coin about a hundred kilometres away, and that is tough," said Mayank N Vahia, a scientist in the department of astronomy and astrophysics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
ISRO has prepared a contingency plan. If the main engine fails to restart, eight small fuel-powered thrusters will be used to put the spacecraft into orbit around Mars.
Low-cost model & China
India launched its space programme five decades ago and developed its own rocket technology after Western powers imposed sanctions for a nuclear weapons test in 1974. In 2009, its Chandrayaan satellite found evidence of water on the moon.
Although facing strong competition from neighbour China, India aspires to be a low-cost supplier of space technology and grab a bigger slice of a more than $300-billion industry.
India has so far launched 40 foreign satellites, many of them for advanced nations.
Still, China has an edge, as it can put heavier satellites into orbit with its bigger launchers.
Modi aims to change that. In June, he hailed the Mars mission's low cost, saying it was less than the budget of the Hollywood space movie 'Gravity'.
A successful Mars mission would boost the global standing of India's state-run space agency.
"It increases the prestige and reliability of India as a spacefaring nation whose rockets and payloads are reliable enough for other countries to use," said Vahia.
India's Mangalyaan cost roughly a tenth of NASA's Mars mission Maven that will attempt to enter orbit around the planet three days earlier on September 21.
Despite its recent success, India's space programme has often drawn criticism as Asia's third-largest economy still ranks poorly on basic social indicators of poverty and hunger.

Sensex  Nifty in negative territory; pharma stocks lead fallBSE Sensex rose modestly on Monday to notch its fourth consecutive session of gains.
Agencies | Posted: September 22, 2014 10:22 am | Updated: September 22, 2014 4:39 pm
After slipping below 27K level in early trades, the benchmark Sensex today recovered smartly to end with a gain of over 116 points at 27,206.74 on good buying in bluechips including ITC, Tata Motors and ONGC even as global cues remained weak.
After a lower start at 27,008.12, the Sensex dipped below the 27,000-mark to touch a low of 26,918.93, down over 170 points. Buying after mid-session, however, lifted the BSE index to settle at 27,206.74, logging a gain of 116.32 points, or 0.43 per cent.
On Friday, the index had fallen 21.79 points, snapping two consecutive days of gain.
Besides ITC , Tata Motors and ONGC that gained in 3-4 per cent range, major Sensex gainers included Hindustan Unilever, SBI, Axis Bank, Hero MotoCorp, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto, GAIL, HDFC Ltd and TCS.
The 50-share NSE Nifty, after slipping below the 8100 mark to touch a low of 8,064.80, bounced back to close 24.85 points, or 0.31 per cent, higher at 8,146.30.
Both the key indices Sensex and Nifty, which were struggling to maintain 27,000 and 8,100-mark in early trades, managed to close above these levels.
“A fresh spell of buying in recent under-performers was a notable feature of today’s session,” said Deepak Pahwa, a Delhi-based broker.
Short covering ahead of monthly expiry on Thursday was also seen in select blue-chip stocks, traders said.
Small-cap index was up 0.51 per cent and Mid-cap rose by 0.20 per cent, indicating continued retail investor interest.
Buying activity also picked up momentum in non-Sensex stocks. Gitanjali Gems, PC Jewellers, Petronet LNG, Jaiprakash Associates and PPAP Automotive, among others, logged gains.
A weak closing in Asian stocks and a lower opening in Europe on reports that China dampened speculation on a potential, however, capped the gains on domestic bourses.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 6.53 crore last Friday as per provisional data.
Sectorally, the BSE Consumer Durables sector index gained the most by surging 3.12 per cent, followed by FMCG index 1.90 per cent. Auto index 1.10 per cent, Oil & Gas index 0.88 per cent, and Banking index 0.29 per cent.

Indigenously built spacecraft will soon attempt to enter Mars orbit; government mulls Ministry of Planetary Affairs

(Indigenously built spacecraft…)
NEW DELHI: How about a 'Ministry of Planetary Affairs' manned by officers from the 'Solar Family Exploration Service' and departments handling missions to Moon, Mars, Venus and Saturn? This is what a rather imaginative Modi government had come up with to explain a new cadre review policy while an indigenously built Indian spacecraft will soon attempt to enter the orbit around Mars, the Red Planet, after a gruelling 680-million-km journey.
Many ministries have been left foxed as well as amused by a 'Model Cadre Review Proposal' circulated to them last week by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), whose charge is with PM Modi himself.
The draft has been made by the DoPT to facilitate the various cadres for the exercise and a 10-page long proforma has been sent across on September 12 on how to prepare the note for the Committee of Secretaries for the cadre review. DoPT has circulated the proposal marked 'Secret' for a non-existing and imagined 'Ministry of Planetary Affairs'.
The note cites a template to say the proposal under consideration is for the review of cadre of the 'Solar Family Exploration Service', calling it a Organised Group 'A' Service under the Ministry of Planetary Affairs. "The officers of this service are responsible for managing the material supply chains to provide procurement and logistic support for solar missions of Government of India ," the note says.
"Apart from postings in the main ministry, i.e., the Ministry of Planetary Affairs , the officers of the Solar Exploration Service are also posted in the field formations and some other important ministries/departments like PMO, Ministry of Science and Technology and Organisations like ISRO. The field offices are situated at Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata," the DoPT note mentions.

India s Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) to face crucial test todayMars orbiter faces crucial test on Monday

Indian Space Research Organisation scientists loaded the commands last week to test if the engine, which has been idling for close to 300 days after it left the Earth's orbit on December 1 last year, is in good shape.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
CHENNAI/BANGALORE: India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) will face the first test of its last manoeuvre around 2.30pm on Monday when the main liquid engine of the spacecraft is expected to fire for four seconds.
Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) scientists loaded the commands last week to test if the engine, which has been idling for close to 300 days after it left the Earth's orbit on December 1 last year, is in good shape. For this 440Newton engine has to fire for 24 minutes on September 24 to put the spacecraft in the desired Martian orbit.
What if it doesn't? That wouldn't be the end of the mission, but the alternative would not be a perfect end to the ambitious project. Plan B is to fire the eight thrusters originally meant for altitude control and orientation. Since these thrusters have less power (22Newton), they will have to be fired for a much longer duration, and yet the orbit achieved through this exercise would not be ideal to carry out studies of the red planet's atmosphere and morphology.
"The difference between success and failure is very thin," Isro chairman K Radhakrishnan told TOI. "If the main engine fires, we will be able to get into a Martian orbit with a periapsis (closest point to Mars) of 423km and an apoapsis (farthest point) of 80,000km. Plan B will also help us get into an orbit, but at this point we don't know how close that would be."
The 440N liquid engine was last fired on December 1 to slingshot the spacecraft from an Earth orbit to the Martian trajectory. The spacecraft authorization committee earlier this month decided to carry out the four-second test to ensure that the long duration of idling hasn't affected the engine that carries corrosive fuel. "Those will be the longest four seconds (when the engine is to test-fire). Uncertainty is part of every space project, but we are confident to the core."
This confidence stems from the thorough tests the engine and the thrusters were made to undergo on ground before PSLV-C25 lifted off with MOM from Sriharikota on November 5 last year. "We did ground tests to check if the engine can re-ignite after a month of idling. It did. Here it has been idle not for a month, but for ten months, but we are fairly confident of its performance. It was the same engine used for Chandrayaan," said Radhakrishnan.
But Isro scientists are awake to eventualities. "Some concerns are with the fuel and oxidiser circuits which are crucial for the restarting of the engine. There could be leakages, corrosion or swelling of parts due to long exposure," he said. Keeping this in mind, Isro, for the first time, has put in place parallel fuel and oxidiser circuits so that supply of fuel and other agents to the engine and the thrusters is not affected at any time.
So, is India's tryst with Mars just two days away? "One might have scored 10,000 runs, but the next match always comes with some tension," Radhakrishnan said.

AS Roma's Alessandro Florenzi (bottom L) celebrates with relatives on the tribune …
MILAN (Reuters) - AS Roma striker Alessandro Florenzi was booked for running into the stands to hug his 82-year-old grandmother after scoring in their 2-0 win over Cagliari in Serie A on Sunday.
Napoli's troubles continued when suffered their second consecutive 1-0 defeat in the league, this time at Udinese, and substitute Jasmin Kurtic scored Fiorentina's first league goal of the season to give them a 1-0 win at Atalanta.
Inter Milan defender Nemanja Vidic, sent off on his Serie A debut, gave away a third minute goal at Palermo after a blunder but his side recovered for a 1-1 draw.
Roma, following up a 5-1 drubbing of CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday, needed only a quarter of an hour to polish off the Sardinians and maintain their 100 percent record in all competitions this season.
Florenzi set up Roma's opening goal in the 10th minute when his low cross was turned in at the far post by Mattia Destro.
The hosts extended their lead three minutes later after Gervinho mis-hit his shot but Florenzi was on hand to fire in from the follow-up.
The 23-year-old celebrated by running to hug his grandmother, who Italian media said was making her first visit to the Stadio Olimpico, and was booked when he returned to the pitch, one of only two yellow cards in the match.
"I'll happily pay any fine for Florenzi," Roma coach Rudi Garcia told reporters. "The hug was the sort of image that we want to see."
Roma, who have a game at Parma on Wednesday, were happy to conserve energy after that and strolled through the rest of the game.
Roma and Juventus, who won 1-0 at AC Milan on Saturday, are the only teams with nine points from their opening three games. Zdenek Zeman's Cagliari have only one point. Verona are two behind them with seven points after winning 1-0 at Torino with a second-half strike by Artur Ionita.
Danilo's second-half goal gave Udinese a 1-0 win over Napoli who produced another disjointed performance after coach Rafael Benitez again rotated his squad. They have only three points from three games.
Fiorentina also looked pedestrian, with Germany striker Mario Gomez giving another off-colour performance, but they were saved by one moment of inspiration from Kurtic.
The Slovenian midfielder collected a pass from Matias Fernandez, turned and scored with a low left-foot shot from 25 metres which went in off the foot of the post in the 58th minute, two minutes after he had come on.
VIDIC BLUNDER
Former Manchester United defender Vidic, returning from suspension after his red card against Torino, had another nightmare moment as he gifted Palermo an early goal in Sicily.
The Serb lost possession in his own area to Franco Vazquez who took full advantage to poke his team in front, the first goal Inter have conceded in the league this season.
Mateo Kovacic spared Vidic's blushes just before halftime when he side-footed an equaliser from the edge of the penalty area, leaving Inter with five points from three games.
A late goal from Chile forward Mauricio Pinilla and outstanding performance from goalkeeper Mattia Perin gave Genoa a 1-0 win at home to 10-man Lazio, their first win of the season.
His goal came shortly after Netherlands defender Stefan de Vrij had been sent off for a second bookable offence for Lazio.
"How much is Perin worth? He is priceless," said Genoa coach Gian Piero Gasperini.
Antonio Cassano scored twice to help Parma come from behind and beat Chievo 3-2 while Sassuolo, thumped 7-0 at Inter Milan one week ago, drew 0-0 at home to Sampdoria.

Google in a fix as China tightens security m...Google faces problems as China's internal security intensifies
New York Times Sep 22, 2014, 02.13PM IST

HONG KONG: Google's problems in China just got worse.
As part of a broad campaign to tighten internal security, the Chinese government has draped a darker shroud over Internet communications in recent weeks, a situation that has made it more difficult for Google and its customers to do business.
Chinese exporters have struggled to place Google ads that appeal to overseas buyers. Biotechnology researchers in Beijing had trouble recalibrating a costly microscope this summer because they could not locate the online instructions to do so. And international companies have had difficulty exchanging Gmail messages among far-flung offices and setting up meetings on applications like Google Calendar.
"It's a frustrating and annoying drain on productivity," said Jeffrey Phillips, a US energy executive who has lived in China for 14 years. "You've got people spending their time figuring out how to send a file instead of getting their work done."
The pain is widespread. Two popular messaging services owned by South Korean companies, Line and Kakao Talk, were abruptly blocked this summer, as were other applications like Didi, Talk Box and Vower. US giants like Twitter and Facebook have long been censored by China's Great Firewall, a system of filters the government has spent lavishly on to control Internet traffic in and out of the country.
Even as Google and other big technology companies have lobbied heavily for an easing of the restrictions, Beijing's broader scrutiny of multinationals has intensified. In late July, anti-monopoly investigators raided Microsoft offices in four Chinese cities to interrogate managers and copy large amounts of data from hard drives. Qualcomm, a big maker of computer chips and a holder of wireless technology patents, faces a separate anti-monopoly investigation.
The increasingly pervasive blocking of the Web, together with other problems like severe air pollution in China's urban centers, has led some businesses to transfer employees to regional hubs with more open and speedier Internets, like Singapore. And more companies are considering similar moves.
"Companies overlooked Internet problems when the economy was booming," said Shaun Rein, managing director of the China Market Research Group, a Shanghai consulting firm. "But now a lot of companies are asking whether they really need to be in China."
The chief technology officer of a startup in China said it had been especially difficult to use Google Drive this summer, making it a challenge for employees to share files and documents.
"We were hooked on collaborative editing," said the chief technology officer, who insisted on anonymity for fear of reprisal from the Chinese authorities. "You can edit a Word document or spreadsheet together and everything is kept in sync - that way our management could track the status of the products we were working on."
As Alibaba's initial public offering of stock in New York on Thursday demonstrated, China has produced many highly successful Web businesses. But many executives and researchers say that a number of homegrown Internet services are poor substitutes for the multinationals' offerings.
Jin Hetian, an archaeologist in Beijing, said it was difficult to do research using Baidu, a local search engine that has limitations for searches in English and other non-Chinese languages and that provides fewer specialized functions.
  "I know some foreign scientists are studying the rings of ancient trees to learn about the climate, for example, but I can't find their work using Baidu," Jin said. "When in China, I'm almost never able to access Google Scholar, so I'm left badly informed of the latest findings."
Kaiser Kuo, a spokesman for Baidu, said the company focused on indexing websites written in Chinese, since most of its customers are Chinese speakers.
Access to some overseas academic sites has also been blocked. A Peking University professor was recently unable to file a letter of recommendation for a student applying to study at a US university because China had blocked the school's website, said a physics researcher at Peking University who insisted on anonymity for fear of retaliation by the Chinese authorities.
Google's troubles in China have been building up for years.
The company shut down its servers in mainland China in March 2010 to avoid online censorship and began directing users in China to obtain unfiltered results from its servers in Hong Kong. The Chinese government then began intermittently blocking the Hong Kong servers as well, notably by halting the ability to reach the site for up to 90 seconds if a user tried to enter anything on a very long list of banned Chinese characters, including those in national leaders' names, and some English words.

The complete guide to flexible work that doesnt kill your careerThis is a lot better than working from bed on a laptop. (AP/Stanley Leary)
SHARE
Max Nisen @MaxNisen
September 22, 2014
Many people work happily and effectively from home. Research suggests that these “flexible” workers can be more productive, and that they have higher levels of well being, and much less depleting conflict between work and family.
But these types of schedules come rarely and at a cost: There’s significant evidence that there are career disadvantages, including  a “flexibility stigma”  on advancement. And there’s a significant gap  (paywall) between the promise of flexibility and the reality.
It takes extra effort, planning, and thoughtfulness to overcome these career penalties. Looking at research, successful people and companies, we’ve come up with a few tips for those trying to make “flexible” work.
Pitch it as productive, not personal
Managers tend to think that using a flexible schedule to be more productive is good—a sign of commitment to the organization—according to a study (pdf)  from Lisa Leslie at the University of Minnesota. But when employees seek such schedules to accommodate aspects of their personal life, they see it as a sign of low commitment and dedication.
Those assumptions shape managers’ perceptions of their employees’ commitment, and have a significant effect on career success, affecting pay raises, job evaluations , and promotions. And these assessments of whether the flexibility is about productivity or personal life are often made without regard to an employee’s performance, attitude, or actual behavior.
There’s a pervasive  “ideal worker bias” toward long hours, a presence in the office, and undervaluing family life, which has historically benefitted men. That means mothers that take flex time lose out on pay and promotions, and that men who do so are sometimes seen as less masculine and see careers suffer as well.
So when approaching a manager to request flexible work, emphasize the productivity motivation, that flexible workers face fewer interruptions, avoid commuting, and better adapt their hours to particular business needs and their own peaks of productivity.
Cali Ressler, a former Best Buy HR executive who helped create the company’s pioneering flexible work program  with Jody Thompson (which has  since ended ), said managers want to hear about outcomes.
“Stop justifying how you’re approaching your work and start talking about the results you’re achieving,” Ressler told Quartz. “Talk until you’re blue in the face about that. And if you’re hit up with nagging questions like ‘Working a short day again?’ or ‘Leaving early? Wish I had your job,’ respond with ‘Is there something I can help you with?’”
Don’t be an outlier
The best time to move to a flexible schedule isn’t when you’re completely on your own in a company where it’s not the norm. Going it alone highlights the comparative lack of face time, and puts all of the onus on the individual rather than the organization to overcome biases against flexible workers.
And negotiating your flex time informally with a sympathetic manager makes you overly dependent on that one manager. It’s an arrangement, not a guarantee that will definitely carry over to a new supervisor.
A recent study (pdf) found workers felt happier and more effective after increasing flexible work options. Supervisors were more supportive of work life balance, and there was less family conflict. But this was in an office where managers were specifically trained to understand the benefits and effectively manage flexible workers, as well as cautioned away from negative biases.
If you’re not at a company with an active community of flexible workers, it’s better to push for reform as a group or wait for a change in policy, rather than go it alone.
The University of Minnesota’s Erin Kelly, one of the most prominent researchers on flexible work environments, advocates for work redesign , where an organization actively changes its culture to promote flexible work lives as a much more workable alternative to one-off arrangements.
When flexible work is viewed as a “perk” or “arrangement,” it sets up traditional work as the standard, which helps create career penalties. But when it’s part of a larger organizational move, and managers are trained to realize that family time doesn’t actually come at the expense of work, it becomes a norm.
Insist on real goals
When goals are vague, managers have a hard time measuring results. In that case, they’re more likely to default to superficial judgement. Ressler, who now runs a consultancy with Thompson focused on advocating for more flexible work environments, says outcome-based goals are essential for those on a flexible schedule.
“Too often, fluffy goals exist like ‘provide good customer service,’ without measures, like ‘what constitutes good customer service?’—which leaves the door wide open for managers to judge employees using time and physical presence,” Ressler says. “The tighter the goal and the more objective the measure, the better. Don’t leave room for subjective analysis.”
In the absence of clear goals, subjective analysis arises, she says. Managers might argue that if you came into the office more or earlier, you’d be doing a better job, for example. The more airtight the goals and metrics are, the more performance is valued—instead of when and where you’re working.
Be conscious of manager bias
In an ideal world, work would speak for itself. But managers look at a lot more when gauging performance, rating those that come in earlier in the morning as better and more conscientious workers , regardless of whether late risers outperform them and stay much later in the evening.
Remote and flexible workers can overcome that by starting their day earlier, by being active online or having work done when a manager gets into the office.
An early physical presence in the office  and lots of “passive face time”  have nothing to do with productivity, and lead to wasted hours just staring at a computer or  office pageantry  (paywall) such as leaving an open takeout container on their desk in an attempt to hide a trip to the gym.
But remote workers have to be extra conscious of the cosmetic —of not just being diligent but appearing so—when working for someone less accustomed to managing flexible workers. That can mean starting work early in the morning, checking in frequently, and responding extra rapidly to emails, phone calls, and instant messages.
It means documenting work and when it’s done, and avoiding the kind of long silences that lead managers to assume you’re chatting with friends or playing internet games, assumptions they’re less likely to make when they see someone in a cubicle (though those same activities might well be happening there).
Look for a company that truly supports flexible work
There’s a broad spectrum, from big companies with well-established policies and a culture built around flexible work, to hybrid companies with large numbers of remote workers, to fully distributed companies that hire most or many of their employees away from a an office .
Such companies are increasingly easy to find through job boards and listing services. We Work Remotely is a job board from the founders of Basecamp , who wrote a book about the rise of the remote workplace.  Flexjobs  is a large, flexible-work-focused job board which publishes an annual list of the best companies for flexible careers. Others focus more narrowly, on working mothers , for example. Ressler and Thompson plan to create a job board of their own.
Sometimes claims about a company’s flexible work are more a public relations effort than a reality. It is worth taking promises with a grain of salt, and ideally speaking to employees who take part in the flexible program before signing on.
Be well-equipped
With big gender and career issues at stake, technology can seem like a secondary concern. But it’s surprisingly important. Spotty internet can mean interruptions, and managers being unable reach you at critical times, both problems that are likely to lead to worse reviews and a negative perception of remote work.
Bad video conferencing makes it more likely that a remote worker will be left out of a meeting, and it’s hard for a disembodied voice to truly participate.
The need to adapt goes beyond hardware. The most successful remote teams have open communication and logs of work, so everyone is operating from the same information. That way, remote workers don’t have to depend on someone to pass along what’s going on in the office, filtering out whatever they’ve forgotten, don’t have time to relay, or don’t want to include.
Your remote workspace matters too. People don’t tend to be as productive working on a laptop from bed as they are in a setup that’s designed for work.

India s coal import rush leads to port congestionIndia's coal import rush leads to port congestion
Reuters
Tweet
NEW DELHI/BHUBANESWAR, Sept 22:  
Indian power and steel companies are importing shiploads of coal due to a severe shortage at home, leading to heavy congestion in one of the country's busiest ports that now has twice the number of vessels waiting than its available berths.
The over-crowding at Paradip port in eastern Odisha could derail India's efforts to prevent a shutdown of more than half of its power plants which are running on stocks of less than a week in the worst deficit since a massive blackout in 2012.
While Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal has urged power firms to bring more coal into India - already the world's No. 3 importer of the fuel, the country's ports are finding it difficult to deal with the swelling traffic.
"We're 100 per cent houseful," said G.P Biswal, deputy conservator of Paradip port. "We're not able to cope with the sudden increase in traffic."
Half of the 27 stranded ships at Paradip are carrying up to 90,000 tonnes of coal each and it takes up to six days to offload a ship once it is berthed. Biswal said rains in the eastern part of the country over the past few days have hampered operations but there could be an improvement in a week.
Some of the ships are to deliver coal for top power and steel firms like Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, Steel Authority of India Ltd, GMR Energy, Tata group and the Adani group - run by billionaire Gautam Adani.
Congestion was higher-than-usual at some other ports too, said Prakash Duvvuri, research head at research firm OreTeam.
Total coal traffic across all ports, including shipments within the country, rose 12 per cent in August from a year ago. Paradip port, the biggest state-owned port by capacity, handled 16 per cent more coal over the period, according to the Indian Ports Association.
India's coal imports have gathered steam after the Supreme Court ruled last month that the country's decades-old method of allocating coal mining concessions was illegal and arbitrary, posing threat to 218 blocks handed out since 1993.
The blocks include about 40 that are producing coal, estimated to have a capacity of about 9 per cent of the 566 million tonnes India produced last year. The court has yet to pass an order on whether to cancel the blocks.
"The court order, which is anxiously awaited, could be one of the prime reasons for the rising imports because the miners may either be feeling that the judgment may further be postponed or the judgment may not favour them," said OreTeam's Duvvuri.
India is home to the world's fifth-largest coal reserve but still needs to resort to imports in a big way as state-owned Coal India, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the country's output, frequently falls short of its output target.
India's overseas purchases of thermal coal, used in power generation, are expected to surge 11 per cent to 150 million tonnes this fiscal year, online market operator mjunction said.
Strong demand and the port congestion will help boost charter rates for ships, said Ian Claxton, managing director of Thailand dry cargo ship operator Thoresen & Co (Bangkok).

Tyre  rubber industries highlight disparity in stock figures to MinistryTyre, rubber industries highlight disparity in stock figures to Ministry
V. Sajeev Kumar
Tweet
Kochi, Sept 22:  
The tyre and rubber industries have expressed concern over the disparity in rubber stock figures and communicated the anomalies to the Commerce Ministry.
In its communication to the Additional Secretary (Plantations), who is also the Chairman of the Expert Committee to draft the National Rubber Policy, the industry said rubber stock figures at the end of August as released by the Rubber Board show a discrepancy of approximately one lakh tonnes.
According to the industry, based on the opening stocks of rubber in April and factoring the key parameters of production, consumption, import and export, the closing stock ought to have been 2.85 lakh tonnes at the end of August.
However, the stock figures published by the board are 1.85 lakh tonnes. In effect, a whopping 1 lakh tonnes has been ‘adjusted’ without any explanation. The discrepancy of one lakh tonnes is huge and has significant consequences for all stakeholders, the industry said.
Since the stock figure is only a derived one and import and export figures are fairly accurate, the inconsistency in stock figure is only a pointer to an anomaly in production or consumption data. In other words, either production is being over estimated or consumption is being under estimated or a combination of both, said Rajiv Budhraja, Director General ATMA.
Adjustment of rubber stock data through self-correction at periodic intervals without baseline correction in production and consumption figures presents a distorted picture. Since the Government policy is determined by imports (as well as the stocks in the country), such an anomaly would lead to flawed assumptions and, hence, erroneous outcomes, said Mohinder Gupta, President, All-India Rubber Industries’ Association (AIRIA).

Triumph launches Thunderbird LT at Rs.15.75lakhThe Thunderbird LT will be the third full-sized cruiser motorcycle in Triumph's line-up here in India.
Express News Service | Posted: September 22, 2014 4:18 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 4:26 pm
The British bike marque Triumph Motorcycles has taken the wraps off its new motorcycle, Thunderbird LT. The bike has been launched at a price label of Rs 15.75 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). The Thunderbird LT will be the third full-sized cruiser motorcycle in Triumph’s line-up here in India, and is slotted between Thunderbird Storm and Rocket III Roadster in terms of pricing and specifications. The bike, unlike the two other cruisers of Triumph, will appeal more to the people who love retro-themed cruisers.
Based wholly on the Thunderbird Storm, the Thunderbird LT has been given a plethora of retro elements, which remind you of the aura of cruisers from bygone decades. The chrome finish to engine, rear view mirrors and dual exhaust pipes, spoke wheels, leather saddle bags on both the sides at rear, back rest for pillion rider, auxiliary headlamps on both the sides of main headlamp with the turn indicators mounted on them, large front windshield – each and every component means pure business.
To add in more old-school feel, the bike is fitted with white wall tyres.
The Thunderbird LT borrows a lot of components and features from its inspiration, the Thunderbird Storm, such as the 22-liter fuel tank, LED tail lamp, front and rear fenders and the tank mounted instrument console, which displays an analog speedometer, fuel gauge and a small LCD strip displaying digital odometer and trip meter.
Under the skin, the Thunderbird LT is the same machine as the Thunderbird Storm, which means it borrows the frame, engine, suspension and brakes from the latter. The engine is the humongous 1,699cc parallel twin motor, which pumps out 94 PS of power and 151 Nm of torque. This largest V-twin in production is coupled with a 6-speed gearbox. The suspension setup on duty is the combination of 47 mm telescopic forks at front and 5-way preload adjustable coil springs at rear. The bike comes fitted with twin disc brakes at front and a single disc brake at rear, which are further assisted with ABS as standard.
The Thunderbird LT is now on sale from all the authorized Triumph dealerships across India, and is offered in three paint schemes – Caspian Blue with Crystal White, Lava Red with Phantom Black and Jet Black. The bike will witness its natural competition from the Harley Davidson’s Softail Heritage Classic.

Islamic State tells followers to attack US  FrenchcitizensIslamic State spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani said the military intervention by the U.S.-led coalition would be the "final campaign of the crusaders". (Source: AP)
Reuters | Baghdad | Posted: September 22, 2014 4:14 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 4:18 pm
Islamic State has urged its followers to attack citizens of the United States , France and other allies who have joined a coalition to fight the militant group, the SITE monitoring website said on Monday.
The United States is building an international coalition to destroy the radical Sunni Muslim group, which has seized swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria and proclaimed a caliphate in the heart of the Middle East.
U.S. and French warplanes have struck Islamic State targets in Iraq and on Sunday the United States said other countries had indicated a willingness to join it if it goes ahead with air strikes against the group in Syria too.
Islamic State spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani said the military intervention by the U.S.-led coalition would be the “final campaign of the crusaders”, according to a transcript published by SITE.
“It will be broken and defeated, just as all your previous campaigns were broken and defeated,” he said in the statement, which urged followers to attack U.S., French, Canadian, Australian and other nationals.

NCP exodus continues; minister  legislator joinBJPSuryakanta Patil, once considered close to NCP chief Sharad Pawar, had criticised him and given enough hints about her plans to join the BJP (Source: PTI photo)
PTI | Mumbai | Posted: September 22, 2014 4:07 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 4:08 pm
In a jolt to NCP, its minister in Maharashtra government Sanjay Savkare and party legislator Kisan Kathore joined BJP here on Monday.
Leader of Opposition in Assembly Eknath Khadse announced that the two were being inducted into the BJP.
“Both the leaders have a strong following in their constituencies and BJP will benefit from it in the October 15 polls,” he said.
Savkare, who represents Bhusawal Assembly seat in north Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district, was Minister of State for Agriculture. Kathore represents Murbad in Thane district.
“I decided to quit NCP because of local issues in my constituency. My supporters were angry over certain things and wanted me to join BJP. I was also noticing that another NCP leader in my region was being promoted by the party leadership and I was being marginalised,” Savkare said.
The two are the latest in a long list of NCP leaders to join BJP in the last few days.
Former NCP leader from Sangli Ajit Ghorpade joined BJP recently in the presence of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.
Ghorpade may lock horns with state Home Minister R R Patil in the Tasgaon-Kavathemahankal Assembly segment, if fielded by BJP which does not have the seat, as per the old seat-sharing formula with bickering ally Shiv Sena.
In a setback to the NCP, several of its senior leaders, including former Union Minister of State Suryakanta Patil, late S B Chavan’s son-in-law and former MP Bhaskarrao Patil-Khatgaonkar, had joined the BJP in presence of party’s national president Amit Shah here earlier this month.
Apart from Suryakanta Patil and Patil-Khatgaonkar, NCP’s former state minister Babanrao Pachpute and former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan’s rival Madhav Kinhalkar also joined the BJP.
Suryakanta Patil, once considered close to NCP chief Sharad Pawar, had criticised him and given enough hints about her plans to join the BJP, while Patil-Khatgaonkar was upset with the Congress leadership and his brother-in-law Ashok Chavan after not being allowed to contest the recent Lok Sabha polls from Nanded constituency.
Pachpute had a running feud with NCP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. Kinhalkar had put Ashok Chavan in the dock by lodging a complaint in the paid news case.

Naver says no IPO for Line messenger app in 2014... 
YOUKYUNG LEE | September 22, 2014 06:54 AM EST | Associated Press
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean Internet company Naver Corp. said Monday its popular Line instant messaging app won't go public on a stock exchange this year.
Naver, which is Line's parent company, said in a regulatory filing that Line Corp. had ruled out going public in 2014.
The filing did not say whether Line will seek an IPO next year.
In July, Naver said Line had submitted an IPO application to the Tokyo Stock Exchange and was also considering listing its shares in New York.
Naver spokesman Nam Jiwoong said Line executives believed 2014 was not an ideal time for an IPO.
He said Line was profitable and growing rapidly so didn't need to raise money by selling shares.
Line had 490 million users as of the end of July.
Line had sales of 183.2 billion won ($176 million) in the April-July quarter. The revenue was mainly from its mobile game service and sales of emoticons, known as stickers, which users send in chats.

German Merck to buy St. Louis-based Sigma Aldrich... 
September 22, 2014 06:49 AM EST | Associated Press
FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German drug company Merck says it has agreed to buy St. Louis-based chemical firm Sigma-Aldrich Corp. for $17 billion.
Darmstadt-based Merck KGaA said Monday it is paying $140 per share in cash for all of Sigma-Aldrich's shares — a premium of 37 percent over Friday's closing price of $102.37.
Sigma-Aldrich has over 9,000 employees and supplies chemicals and laboratory equipment to government and commercial research facilities. It said its board of directors has unanimously approved the deal, which is expected to close next year, subject to regulators' approval.
Sigma-Aldrich CEO Rakesh Sachdev said the deal was a "very positive outcome" for shareholders due to the price premium and for employees, "who will benefit from enhanced opportunities as part of a larger, more global organization."

Ahead of the Bell: US home sales...and
versions
WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Association of Realtors reports on sales of existing homes in August. The report is scheduled to be released Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern.
SALES DROP: Economists expect that sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.18 million last month, according to a survey by data firm Fact Set. In July, homes sold at a yearly pace of 5.15 million.
SUMMER BUYING: The rebound from the housing bust that triggered the recession has been painfully slow. The share of Americans who own homes has trended downward over the course of the five year recovery, as more Americans are becoming renters. The ownership rate fell to 64.7 percent through the middle of this year, down from a peak of 69.2 percent toward the end of 2004, according to the Census Bureau.
Sales were curbed by winter storms earlier in the year. They began to accelerate through the summer as mortgage rates eased back from 52-week highs. But the combination of rising home prices last year and sluggish wage growth has limited sales.
Purchases of existing homes continue to lag last year's pace of 5.1 million. Annual sales of 5.5 million are consistent with a healthy housing market, according to analysts.
Many consider home sales to be the missing link in a solid economic recovery. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently told Congress that housing has proven to be disappointing this year.
Indicators heading into the fall and winter are mixed for real estate, however.
Home construction plunged 14.4 percent in August compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Much of that decline was due to a drop-off in building apartment complexes, but single-family home construction also tumbled 2.4 percent.
Applications for building permits, a sign of future activity, dipped 5.6 percent to an annual rate of 998,000.
Yet builders expressed more confidence. The sentiment index from the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo climbed in September to 59, the highest reading since November 2005. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor.
New-home construction increased 15.7 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million homes, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
Home prices are also increasing at a slower clip, which should help ease affordability pressures.
Prices rose 7.4 percent in July from July 2013, according to real estate data provider CoreLogic. That was slightly below June's year-over-year increase of 7.5 percent and far below a recent peak of 11.9 percent in February.
Yet incomes remain weak, making it more taxing for would-be buyers trying to save for a down payment.
The Census Bureau said last week that median household incomes were $51,939 in 2013. Adjusting for inflation, that's 8 percent lower than in 2007, when the recession began.
And mortgage rates have begun to rise from recent lows.
Average rates for 30-year mortgages rose last week to 4.23 percent from 4.12 percent, according to mortgage company Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates are below the levels at the start of this year, yet they're up from their 52-week low of 4.1 percent.

Pedro Snchez en programas de la tele: error o aciertoPedro Sánchez en programas de la tele: ¿error o acierto?
LAURA RAMOS / EFE

La participación de Pedro Sánchez en programas populares de televisión como forma de acercarse a los electores podría tener altos costes para su liderazgo en el PSOE, según algunos expertos. Otros creen que obtendrá más réditos que en otros formatos, porque su telegenia supera a su dialéctica.
La irrupción esta semana del principal líder de la oposición en Sálvame y El Hormiguero (este domingo estará con Risto Mejide en Viajando con Chester) ha supuesto una innovación que expertos en comunicación política consultados por Efe consideran un estrategia correcta en sí misma, pero que no terminan de ver como un acierto.
Para Ramón Cotarelo, catedrático de Ciencias Políticas y Sociología de la UNED, lo que está haciendo Sánchez es "imitando a Pablo Iglesias, que es quien realmente ha hecho una revolución mediática". "Da la impresión de que no sólo se comporta como Pablo, se viste como Pablo e imita a Pablo en todo, sino que además ahora está haciendo lo mismo: proyectarse mediáticamente sin prejuicios, rompiendo barreras", observa.
Si eso es un acierto o no "el tiempo lo dirá", dice Cotarelo, que alerta del peligro de que a Sánchez le "caiga el sambenito de copiota". En caso de que le dé buen resultado, este especialista advierte de que el secretario general del PSOE "tendría que integrase en el mundo estrambótico de los programas de ese tipo" y eso podría llevar a su desprestigio.
"Ir a un lugar donde va la gente a decir estupideces tiene el riesgo de que puedes quedar en ridículo y eso lo arrastras toda la vida, tiene costes muy altos", sostiene.
"CONFUNDIR A LOS ELECTORES"
Tamara Vázquez, profesora de Periodismo de la Universidad CEU San Pablo , también cree que Pedro Sánchez "puede perder credibilidad" y "confundir a los electorales".
En su opinión, la nueva estrategia del PSOE puede ser un "error" si sobrepasa unas "líneas que son muy difíciles de establecer". De esta forma, si Sánchez no "afina muy fino" conseguiría la "visibilidad" que busca, pero "a costa de su credibilidad como líder".
A este respecto, Tamara Vázquez diferencia claramente entre la presencia que ha tenido Sánchez en Sálvame y en El Hormiguero y no duda de que la primera ha sido una "improvisación" y una "equivocación".
"SÁLVAME ES PARAR ALGUNOS LÍMITES"
"Sálvame es pasar algunos límites; esa era una barrera que no se habían atrevido a atravesar los políticos y puede afectar a su liderazgo", advierte .
Esta profesora no cree que el líder socialista esté copiando a Pablo Iglesias, ni que su estrategia sea una consecuencia directa del fenómeno Podemos, "sino de las características del propio Pedro Sánchez, por su formación, su edad y la forma de comunicar que tienen los nuevos lideres políticos, que entienden que tienen que estar en todos los medios".
Luis Marañón, el politólogo que asesoró en estrategia y comunicación al que fuera rival de Pedro Sánchez en las primarias del PSOE, Eduardo Madina, aplaudió la presencia de Sánchez en El Hormiguero desde el primer momento: "Ir al programa líder de audiencia a las 22.00 es un rotundo acierto. Y como no se había hecho nunca, más rotundo aún", escribió esa noche en su twitter, donde recordó que no era "sospechoso de preferencia alguna por el protagonista".
MÁS TELEGENIA QUE DIÁLECTICA
Para este experto, "si trabajas con una persona cuya telegenia es superior a su capacidad dialéctica no puedes dejar pasar la oportunidad", ha dicho a Efe. A su juicio, Sánchez "obtendrá más réditos en programas de televisión de ese tipo que en cualquier otro formato".
Según explica, la principal ventaja de los programas populares o familiares consiste en que "se llega a una audiencia que en ese momento no mantiene una posición defensiva hacia los mensajes políticos".
No obstante, recuerda que una "acción eficaz" como la aparición en El Hormiguero no garantiza el "éxito de la estrategia".
El también politólogo Eli Gallardo calcula en su twitter que, si el PSOE hubiera tenido que pagar los impactos generados ese día en Telecinco y en Antena 3, le hubiera "costado varios miles de euros" y anima a Pedro Sánchez a dar "continuidad" a esa nueva forma de comunicación.
¿DÓNDE IRÁ SÁNCHEZ?
El entorno más cercano de Sánchez deja claro que éste estará allí donde sea reclamado por los ciudadanos, sin discriminaciones ni prejuicios y con absoluto respeto a todas las audiencias.
Recuerdan a Efe que los seguidores de "Sálvame" también votan y que puede ser un canal como cualquier otro para responder a las inquietudes de los españoles y comunicar sus propuestas.
La impulsora de toda esta revolución en la comunicación del PSOE es Verónica Fumanal, asesora personal de Pedro Sánchez y que ya ha trabajado con otros líderes políticos en Cataluña.
Su reto es conseguir que Pedro Sánchez sea un líder conocido y reconocido, con una personalidad propia y una imagen moderna, no sólo en los ambientes políticos o periodísticos, sino entre la gente de la calle.

La palabra 'populismo' va unida últimamente en el debate político a Podemos. El líder del PSOE, Pedro Sánchez, ha hecho referencia a ello en repetidas ocasiones en las últimas semanas.
Sánchez, no obstante, no es el único que ha acusado a Podemos de populista. Sin ir más lejos, el vicesecretario de Organización del PP, Carlos Floriano, arremetió contra el partido por su "populismo bolivariano de telepredicador" .
Pero, ¿tú qué opinas? ¿es populista Podemos? Puedes votar.

Hold Capital First; target of Rs 360: Sharekhan
Sharekhan has recommended a hold rating on Capital First with a target price of Rs 360 per share in its September 19, 2014 research report.
Post your opinion here
Sharekhan's report on Capital First
"Capital First has appreciated by 72% since our initiation (on January 2013) and by 116% on a YTD basis led by a strong growth in the balance sheet and improved profitability. While we believe the company will sustain the high rate of growth leading to improved RoE, the current valuation (1.8x FY2017E) has turned closer to that of the bigger NBFCs with better operating metrics."
"The company has invested significantly to build newer businesses (two-wheeler loans, consumer durable loans etc), which are growing at a strong pace. Though execution risks persist in these businesses (defaults are relatively higher in these segments), but stringent credit processes and an experienced management team should adequately weather the challenges."
"Since the stock has appreciated significantly from our initiation price and its valuation looks fair (1.8x FY2017E BV), we recommend investors to take some profit off the table. The valuation gap with the bigger NBFCs having better operating metrics has narrowed leaving limited room for upside in the near term. We, therefore, revise our rating on the stock to Hold with a revised price target of Rs 360, valuing the stock at 2x FY2017E BV. Capital First may benefit from operating leverage which should bring its RoE closer to that of its peers by FY2018. Hence, from the long-term perspective we are sanguine about the stock", says Sharekhan research report.

Buy Relaxo Footwears; target of Rs 575: Sharekhan
Sharekhan is bullish on Relaxo Footwears and has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 575 in its September 19, 2014 research report.
Post your opinion here
Sharekhan's report on Relaxo Footwears
"Relaxo Footwears would remain focused on the consumer with the introduction of value-added and premium products under each of its brands. Thus, product premiumisation and steady volume growth would drive the revenues and margins ahead. We expect Relaxo to post a 22.8% revenue growth over FY2014-17."
"Over the years, it has built a strong manufacturing base; its current capacity is 160 million pairs as against 110 million pairs sold in FY2014. Thus, the company has adequate capacity to take care of the volume growth for the next two years. This would aid in asset utilisation, thereby improving the return ratios. We expect Relaxo’s RoE to improve from 21% in FY2014 to 25.4% in FY2017."
"Relaxo’s strong presence in the lucrative mid priced footwear segment (through its top-of-the-mind recall brands like Hawaii, Flite and Sparx) along with its integrated manufacturing set-up, lean working capital requirement and vigilant management puts it in a sweet spot to cash in on the strong growth opportunity unfolding in the footwear category due to a shift from unbranded to branded products. Thus, we remain positive on the business. We introduce our FY2017 estimates in this note, expecting the revenues and earnings to grow at a CAGR of 22.8% and 33.5% respectively over FY2014-17. We also roll over our multiple from FY2016 estimate to FY2017 estimate to arrive at our revised price target of Rs 575 (valuing the stock at 22x FY2017E). We thus maintain our Buy rating on the stock", says Sharekhan research report.

Hyderabad, Sept 22:  
NanoHealth, a social venture founded by a group of ISB alumni has launched health care services for slum dwellers by creating local health networks and using technology to take affordable healthcare to their doorstep.
Nano Health has partnered with GVK BIO’s proprietary HEART(Health Emphasized Analytical and Reporting Tool) platform - a cloud based healthcare analytics tool. It will deploy the mobile enabled and multilingual disease management application on the platform to register, enroll, record and manage patients across multiple countries starting with Hyderabad in Telangana.
It will have multiple applications which are independent while being interconnected with numerous sources of data offering quick medical decision support, Manish Ranjan, CEO of NanoHealth and ISB alumnus said in a press release.
NanoHealth is started by 5 alumni of Indian School of Business, Ashis Bondia, Manish Ranjan, Ramanathan Lakshmanan, Aditi Vaish and Pranav Kumar Maranganty.
The application acts as an enabler, through information processing. Its mission is to improve general health and reduce/reverse progression of chronic diseases by building patient centric, high quality healthcare and clinical systems", Shiva Subramaniam – Senior Vice President and Head of Informatics at GVK Biosciences said.
NanoHealth is creating a network of community Health-workers known as "Saathis" and equipping them with a diagnostic device called "Doc-in-a-Box". The doctor’s reach is extended by these Saathis who are, empowered women in the community forming a strong network of caregivers. The team conducted their pilot in Anjaiah Nagar slum in Hyderabad and they plan to scale up in Hyderabad first before moving to other large cities.
The team has been invited by former US President Bill Clinton and the HULT Prize foundation to make a pitch to a panel of judges at the HULT Prize finals in New York later this month. HULT Prize is the largest student competition in the world and NanoHealth is one of the top 6 finalists chosen from 11,000 applications this year, the release claimed.

CAG calls for close review of over Rs 74 000-cr unrealised tax revenueCAG calls for close review of over Rs 74,000-cr unrealised tax revenue
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 22:  
Over Rs 74,000 crore in central excise and service tax revenue is pending realisation for 2012 -13 on various grounds, including that of injunction or appeal.
A total of 37,652 cases involving revenue of Rs 74,861.71 crore — Rs 53,521.86 crore related to central excise and Rs 21,339.85 crore as service tax — is pending in the ‘call book’ as of March 31, 2013, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has said in its report.
A call book acts as a set of records of those central excise and service tax cases where the demand could not be realised due to reasons such as the department having gone in appeal and injunction from courts, etc.
The CAG, while giving out the figure, called for close monitoring of call book items which are of “very high” value and asked Finance Ministry to look into them to find out how many of them could be really retained.
“We tabulated the performance of the department in respect of call book clearance in central excise during recent years and noted that the pendency of cases in the call book is still very high, indicating the need for close monitoring of the process of review of call book items,” the report said.
The call book pendency of central excise cases was Rs 46,727.46 crore and Rs 42,207.90 crore during 2011-12 and 2010-11, respectively.
The CAG said that the number of call book cases and the revenue involved in case of customs duty both rose during 2012-13, “indicating the need for close monitoring, including monitoring of the efficacy of the monthly review process“.
As per the instructions of Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), call book cases need to be reviewed on a monthly basis. The review may result in “substantial reduction” in the number of unconfirmed demands in the call book, the instructions state.
The call book pendency of service tax cases was Rs 20,273.45 crore and Rs 15,667.47 crore during 2011-12 and 2010-11, respectively, adds the CAG report which was tabled in Parliament in July this year.

Rupee gains for third day  rises 8 paiseUpdated: September 18, 2014 18:08 IST
Rupee gains for third day, rises 8 paise
PTI
economy, business and finance
Rebounding from one-month lows, the Indian rupee on Thursday ended eight paise higher at 60.84 against the greenback following late dollar selling by exporters and a strong rally in local shares.
A fall in dollar value abroad against major rivals also helped rupee recover from early losses as US Federal Reserve pledged to maintain its easy monetary policy. Dollar index, a gauge of six major global units, was down 0.25 per cent.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic currency resumed weak at 61.09 a dollar from previous close of 60.92. It then dropped further to a one-month intra-trade low of 61.2050, a level not seen since August 13, 2014 when it had touched a low of 61.30.
The rupee later bounced back to a high of 60.8350 on strong rally in local stocks before concluding at 60.84, displaying a rise of eight paise or 0.13 per cent.
In previous two sessions, the rupee gained 21 paise.
The rupee’s rise against dollar came as capital outflow fears receded. The Fed’s pledge to keep interest rates near zero for a considerable time, gives relief to emerging markets, including India.
Renewed buying by foreign funds in local equities too aided the rupee rise. FPIs/FIIs, after selling shares worth $120.70 million on Tuesday, picked up shares worth $29.29 mn on Wednesday, as per SEBI data.
The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex on Thursday zoomed by 480.92 points, or 1.81 per cent, to end one-week high.

Flickr/Getty | FlickrWeekend Roundup: Is China Outpacing Mexico on the Rule of Law?
Getty/WorldPost Illustration
On the same day this week that President Obama announced a measure that could give legal protection to 5 million undocumented immigrants, massive protests raged across Mexico against the impunity and corruption that led to the horrific massacre of 43 students. From Mexico City, Sergio Sarmiento, Elena Poniatowska and Homero Aridjis chronicle the events and ponder what's next. Anthropologist Claudio Lomnitz examines the causes behind Mexico's corrosive impunity.   Meanwhile, as Xin Chunying writes from Beijing, China is also seeking to establish the rule of law through steadily boosting the role of the National People's Congress. While stifling dissent, China's President Xi is taking on both "tigers and flies" in his no-holds-barred assault from the top down on corruption.   Can China's effort succeed without active public engagement? Can Mexico learn from China and move from angry protest to systemic change? (continued)

By Ryan Vlastelica
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a fifth straight weekly advance after China's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and its euro zone peer announced asset purchases in efforts to boost each region's economy.
The gains were broad on a day when both the Dow and S&P 500 ended at closing records. All ten primary S&P 500 industry sectors ended the day higher, while 63 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory. About 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed names were higher on the day.
The People's Bank of China said it was cutting one-year benchmark lending rates for the first time in more than two years.
The move came after European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said "excessively low" inflation had to be raised quickly by whatever means necessary, rekindling expectations the ECB will move to stimulate the euro zone economy. The ECB said it started buying asset-backed securities to encourage banks to lend and revive the economy.
"It isn't the size of the moves but the shock value of the direction that is really lifting markets today," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets. "This is a one-two punch for global growth."
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 88.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,807.94, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 10.7 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,063.45 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.10 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,712.97.
Both the Dow and S&P ended at records. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P added 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent. It was the fifth straight weekly advance for all three.
Gains in the Nasdaq were limited by declines in large-cap tech companies. Microsoft Corp  fell 1.5 percent to $47.97 while Netflix Inc  slid 2.1 percent to $360.28.
GameStop Corp  sank 13 percent to $37.86 a day after the video game retailer posted quarterly revenue and earnings well below expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500.
The benchmark index's biggest gainers were Ross Stores  and Autodesk Inc , both of which rallied after results late Thursday. Ross jumped 7.3 percent to $89.27 while Autodesk was up 6.1 percent to $61.95.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,029 to 1,039, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,461 issues rose and 1,286 fell, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 96 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 44 new lows.
About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the month-to-date average of 6.35 billion.

Taco Bell Spinoff Pulls Controversial Red Star Logo After Outcryreddit
Yum! Brands just suffered a red scare.
Less than a week after launching Banh Shop , its foray into Vietnamese bánh mì sandwiches, the fast-food giant behind Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut yanked the red star from its logo. Vietnamese Americans in Dallas, where Yum is testing consumers’ appetites for the food, petitioned the company, complaining that the red star evoked painful memories of Vietnam’s communist regime.
Banh Shop's old logo.
"Think about a German shop that sells bagels, and the logo has a swastika -- what would you think?" Thanh Cung, president of the Vietnamese-American Community of Greater Dallas who started a petition to remove the logo, told The Huffington Post on Friday. "That's exactly what Vietnamese people in the United States feel."
Cung, 63, fought against communist forces in the South Vietnamese army. When his side lost the war in 1975, he was thrown into a prison labor camp for two years, where he said he was starved, regularly tortured and beaten. In 1986, he immigrated to the United States.
Companies such as Texaco, Heineken and Macy’s use red stars in their logos. But paired with the slogan “Saigon street food” -- once the capital of South Vietnam, Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City after Northern communist forces invaded -- the image carries a different meaning for some .
Wish #BanhShop knew how offensive it is to use a Communist red star in conjunction with the word Saigon. This Viet won't visit.
— joyhays (@joyhays) September 17, 2014
In 1977, millions fled Vietnam as the communist government began cracking down on people perceived as a threat to its ideology. After Congress lessened the restrictions on immigration with the Refugee Act of 1980, a mass wave of Vietnamese people arrived in the U.S., settling mostly in California and Texas. More than 1.7 million Americans marked Vietnamese as their ethnicity on the 2010 census .
Yum reacted swiftly to the criticism, which mounted after the Dallas blog CultureMap first reported on the controversy. By Thursday afternoon, Jonathan Blum, a senior vice president at Yum, emailed Cung a personal apology, and promised to remove the star from all materials and signage by the end of the day. By Friday afternoon, the star was Photoshopped out of the company’s logo on its website.
“It was never our intention to offend anyone, but we see we have made a mistake and in hindsight, we should have recognized this logo could be offensive,” Blum wrote in the email, forwarded to HuffPost by a Yum! spokeswoman. “We will design a new logo, and would greatly appreciate your reviewing it, along with other aspects of this restaurant, before we make a final decision.”
The logo on Banh Shop's website on Friday.
Cung said he agreed to advise the company when they send him a redesign.
Calls to Banh Shop’s sole location -- Yum is slated to open a second one in Dallas Fort Worth International Airport later this month -- were met with a busy signal.
Banh Shop is Yum!’s latest attempt to compete with its rapidly-growing upstart rival Chipotle. Bánh mì, which simply means “bread” in Vietnamese, is made with baguettes stuffed with meat or tofu and vegetables. Banh Shop charges about $7 per sandwich.

NPPA caps prices of 43 more medicinesNPPA caps prices of 43 more medicines
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 20, 2014  | 17:05 IST
National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has capped prices of 43 medicines, including antibiotic ciprofloxacin, BCG vaccine and anti-diabetic drug metformin, to make them affordable for the common man.
Major drug companies, including Cipla, Ranbaxy, Lupin and Cadila, are likely to be impacted. The drug price regulator said that manufacturers of these drugs having maximum retail price higher than the ceiling price specified shall revise the MRP to an amount not exceeding the ceiling price plus local taxes wherever applicable in accordance with paragraph 13 (1) and 24 of the Drug Prices Control Order, 2013.
"This is a straight-forward, most predictable, overdue action which has been done by us," a NPPA official said requesting anonymity. These medicines join the list of 348 drugs deemed essential and are therefore subject to price caps covering up to 30 per cent of the total drugs sold.
An official at the Department of Pharmaceuticals confirmed the price cap move , but declined to give details. The recommendations will be sent to health ministry by mid-October, he said. Global and Indian drugmakers have been hit by wide-ranging government-imposed price reductions in the last one year in India.

Business books of the decade
The Business Book of the Year Award has selected 152 books for its longlists since 2005. Together the longlisted books constitute a reader’s guide to a turbulent decade for business, media and publishing, with the financial crisis at its centre
The world wants to know Silicon Valley ’s secret. Here, in three books by four highly successful tech entrepreneurs and investors, are some of the answers. Only, don’t expect them to agree on how you should go about making your first billion.
Creating a great start-up, it appears, is a cerebral game of chess, one that isn’t worth playing unless you’ve thought through how you’re going to win before you even start. That is, if it isn’t a gut-wrenching rollercoaster ride in which pure courage (along with a fair amount of puking and tears) are the only things that will get you through. Or then again, it may turn out to be mainly an exercise in organising very large numbers of creative – even brilliant – people in a loose but co-ordinated way that has never been achieved before in business history.
More
Remembering the fall of the Berlin Wall
As this suggests, there is no simple – or single – formula. Since entrepreneurialism is by definition one of the great pragmatic exercises, how-to books can take you only so far. “Today’s ‘best practices’ lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried”, writes Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, hedge fund investor, venture capitalist and Facebook director). But the collective advice and – more importantly – first-hand experiences of some of Silicon Valley’s most successful figures of the past 15 years certainly provide some pointers.
In Zero to One, Thiel makes the start-up business sound almost mystical: “by creating new technologies,” he says, “we rewrite the plan of the world”. Out of nothing comes the start-up (hence the title). It isn’t a bad way to think about things. Entrepreneurialism requires, more than anything, sheer creative energy: not just originality but the intellectual concentration and determination to succeed, sometimes seemingly against all odds.
Thiel is the ultimate contrarian. Think of something you believe that nobody else does, he recommends, then go and make a business out of it. In this world, many of the accepted techniques of the current generation of Silicon Valley start-ups – look for incremental advances, stay lean and mean, keep iterating on the product and let sales take care of themselves – are rejected. Go big or go home.
 
An accomplished chess player, Thiel is a big believer in thinking out the best business before you start. Any talk of “pivoting” – a favourite Silicon Valley word of the moment, used to describe how companies that fail at one thing keep adjusting goals until they hit on something that works – would get short shrift if he was an investor.
Similarly, Thiel takes a dim view of Silicon Valley’s present obsession with “disruption”, a “self-congratulatory buzz­word for anything posing as trendy and new”. People who think of themselves as disrupters are too busy being distracted by the “dark forces” they think they’re unseating to focus on the real job at hand, of coming up with great products.
Thiel’s tips include never trusting anyone in a tie – at least, not if they’re claiming to be tech entrepreneurs
The best business opportunities of all, says Thiel, are monopolies: why bother with the wasteful process of competition when you can own it all? His justification for digital monopolies is that they aren’t like the static, rent-collecting monsters of the old economy: these are dynamic platforms that bring new value to the world (think Apple’s iOS mobile software platform or – Thiel doesn’t mention it – Facebook).
Thiel, as a fan of dominant companies, clearly can’t understand why two of the greatest monopolies the tech industry has created should have set about the wasteful business of trying to destroy each other. He writes: “Just as war cost the Montagues and the Capulets their children, it cost Microsoft and Google their dominance: Apple came along and overtook them all,” with the iPhone.
It is a shame that, in How Google Works, Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg don’t address this question head-on. Schmidt, as former chief executive, and Rosenberg, as former chief of product development, played central roles in building Google during a key phase in its existence, from the period before its 2004 initial public offering.
Their book begins, tantalisingly, by describing how board member Michael Moritz called for an urgent meeting in the company’s early days to come up with a strategy to defeat Finland (a code name, it turns out, for Microsof t – though the authors then spoil their own anecdote by revealing that this a code name for the real code name).
Some of Google’s most important (and successful) initiatives, such as its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system, look like deliberate attempts to counter Microsoft’s main software platforms. So it’s ironic that the European Commission is considering launching a competition investigation into whether Google uses Android to block competitors, a case that would have direct parallels with an earlier case over Microsoft’s Windows.
 
Yet in this book, any discussion of competitive strategy is quickly buried. The authors brush off things they did to counter Microsoft as “a few tactical points”, instead coming up with platitudes about how focusing on the product and delivering the best user experience were the keys to holding the software giant at bay.
Schmidt and Rosenberg put much of their emphasis on people: how to hire, train, motivate, organise, reward (and occasionally sack) the talent needed to run a company like Google. Though the company’s culture is known for its enviable perks, they stress the importance of the hothouse atmosphere they created by jamming workers together in overcrowded cubicles (forget about working from home).
They also have a simple rule for any company in the tech world: double down on the engineers. By keeping this in mind at a time when Google’s product strategy was in danger of bloat, they claim to have kept the company focused on true innovation. In such a culture even Sheryl Sandberg , a key employee and now number two at Facebook , could be turned down for a job the first time around because she lacked an engineering background.
The question that looms large over any book like this is whether Google’s leaders have truly been brilliant in organising a 21st-century model of what a deeply innovative corporation will come to look like – or whether, with search advertising, they were just lucky enough to stumble on the biggest cash machine the advertising industry has ever produced. The jury is still out on whether the culture they have built – and all that money pouring out – can produce the innovation to carry Google into a future beyond search.
For a more down-to-earth view of start-up life after these big claims, The Hard Thing About Hard Things makes the perfect antidote. Ben Horowitz, who went through two start-ups before launching a venture capital firm with partner Marc Andreessen, gives a warts-and-all view of what it’s really like to be in charge of a business weeks away from running out of cash, threatened by the loss of its biggest customer or outflanked by a competitor with a better product. His seat-of-the-pants answer: “There is always a move.”
 
It is the real-world anecdotes that produce the most telling lessons in books such as these, and Horowitz comes up with some of the best. If you wondered how stress-inducing it is run a start-up, it’s all here – right down to agonising about whether excessive use of the f-word should be kept as part of a new company’s culture (the cursing stayed). Thiel has tips of his own. They include never trusting anyone in a suit and tie (at least, not if they’re claiming to be tech entrepreneurs): it was these well-dressed types who were behind many of the failed alternative energy companies Silicon Valley invested in recently, he claims.
Schmidt and Rosenberg, meanwhile, lift the lid only occasionally on life inside Google – a company they continue to serve as, respectively, executive chairman and adviser. Among their more revealing anecdotes is how co-founder Larry Page, when he was unhappy about a new Google advertising format, simply posted a public message that “These ads suck”. The message inspired a group of engineers not even responsible for the problem to come up with a solution, they say. Management by humiliation might be frowned on elsewhere, but apparently it works at Google.
Still, as always with books told from the front lines of business, you can’t help thinking that the really juicy stuff has been held back. In the clubby world of Silicon Valley, after all, it doesn’t pay to tread on too many toes.
What is left from reading these books is a sense of the conundrums that even the most successful tech start-ups find hard to solve. Hiring the best talent and “scaling” – or growing at breakneck speed before another company can come along and steal a new market – are two of the main skills of Silicon Valley. But even there, they can be challenging.
Schmidt and Rosenberg, for instance, warn of the “knaves” whose personal ambitions can wreck a company – though they beg patience for talented “divas” who can also stretch the patience. Horowitz has his own categories of workers – usually highly intelligent – who are liable to sink a company: heretics, flakes and jerks. Then there are “old people” – code for those who come from bigger companies with more experience, and who may damage the culture. Is this how tech CEOs talk about their staff behind closed doors?
Another common problem concerns size: there are no easy answers here for how to retain a new company’s dynamism as it grows. Thiel catches the problem with his astute definition of a start-up: “The largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.” What happens to that shared purpose when it exceeds that number?
Horowitz sums up the horror that awaits: “At a certain size, your company will do things that are so bad that you never imagined that you’d be associated with that kind of incompetence.” Seeing workers start to waste money, produce sloppy work and waste each other’s time “may well make you sick”, he warns aspiring chief executives.
All three of these books have their flaws. Thiel’s book was stitched together from classes he has given at Stanford University by an eager student and joint writer, Blake Masters, while Horowitz’s work is partly built out of a series of long blog posts. But they all deserve a place on the bookshelf of aspiring entrepreneurs. If nothing else, you will know how to dress – and curse – the next time you approach a venture capitalist to raise money.

Review of Atlas Shrugged  Part IIIBy Ilya Somin September 21
My wife and I recently saw Atlas Shrugged, Part III (AKA, Atlas Shrugged: Who is John Galt?), the third and final movie in the trilogy based on Ayn Rand’s famous novel. Unfortunately, it was so bad that there isn’t much point to going over its weaknesses at any length. The acting was mostly wooden, the production values were little better than those of a 1950s B movie, and the villains are so ludicrously incompetent and stupid (much more so than in the book), that it becomes impossible to take them seriously. I thought the first movie in this series was merely mediocre, and the second was actually pretty decent . The third is so ridiculously bad, however, that it almost negates whatever was good in the first two. The cameo appearances by famous libertarian-leaning people like Ron Paul and Judge Alex Kozinski were easily the highlights of the film. Their work was considerably better than that of the actual professional actors playing the lead roles. Almost the only positive thing I can say about the film is that my wife liked it better than I did. She knows a good deal more about Ayn Rand’s work than I do. So I should acknowledge the possibility that the film has some hidden virtues that escaped me, but might be noticed by a more sophisticated viewer.
It must also be acknowledged that some of the weaknesses of the movie trilogy are inherited from the source material. For example, the book has too many long, didactic speeches that don’t translate easily to the big screen (and in my opinion don’t always work well even in print). But it should nonetheless be possible to make a good movie trilogy or miniseries based on this story. After all, Atlas Shrugged does have a dramatic and engrossing central plot. It has attracted tens of millions of fans over the years – by no means all of them hard-core Objectivists or libertarians.
I am far from being the world’s biggest Ayn Rand fan . But, despite her weaknesses, she was one of the greatest-ever popularizers of libertarian ideas (even if that is not how she viewed herself). Her work clearly strikes a chord with many people. And many of the themes of Atlas Shrugged, such as the dangers of public ignorance and crony capitalism, are at least as relevant to our time as they were when the book was published in the 1950s.
Sadly, this movie version of Atlas Shrugged – especially the awful finale – magnifies the book’s flaws, while conveying very few of its strengths. Ayn Rand deserved better. The same goes for viewers who sat through this train-wreck of a movie.

Saradha: Nalini Chidambarams clarification soughtinquiry
Queries posed on her links with Manoranjana Sinh, who introduced her to Saradha Group head, Sudipto Sen.
The CBI on Saturday sought some clarifications from Nalini Chidambaram, the wife of former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, in connection with the Saradha chit fund scam. “The CBI did not question me. The CBI officers wanted to know whether Ms. Manoranjana Sinh [estranged wife of Congress leader Matang Sinh] had consulted me professionally. I told them yes, I was consulted,” said Ms. Chidambaram in a statement to the media.
CBI officials said they approached Ms. Chidambaram in Chennai on Saturday to seek clarifications as she had been the legal advisor to Manoranjana Sinh. Ms. Sinh had purportedly introduced Ms Chidambaram to Saradha Group head Sudipto Sen, now the prime accused in the chit fund scam, in connection with a proposed deal between him and Ms. Sinh.
The CBI had earlier questioned Ms. Sinh for her suspected role in the scam. According to the agency, probe have indicated that she had financial dealings with one of the Saradha group companies. In his April 2013 letter to the CBI, Sudipto Sen had alleged that he had dealings worth about Rs.28 crore with her, which included Rs.25 crore payment made out to company. In the same letter, he mentioned that Ms. Sinh had introduced him to Ms. Chidambaram as her legal advisor.

People. Process. Data. Things. Business opportunities like never before.People. Process. Data. Things. Business opportunities like never before.

The Internet of Everything creates a new world of opportunities.
Interconnectedness, the hallmark of evolving technology, is changing the way we work, live, play and learn. Evidence of this transformation is all around us: smart cities, sensor driven devices, smart vehicles and even smart people leading this innovation. In the very near future, pretty much everything you can imagine will wake up. There is an intelligent and instinctive connection between people, things, machines, and data and their intermittent activity, a digital ecosystem is in the offing and is known as the Internet of Everything (IoE).
Cisco defines the Internet of Everything (IoE) as bringing together people, process, data, and things to make networked connections more relevant and valuable than ever before - turning information into actions that create new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunity for businesses, individuals, and countries.
In financial terms, the Internet of Everything is poised to generate $19 trillion in Value at Stake over the next 10 years (2013-2022) for the private and public sectors combined. The private sector will account for $14.4 trillion and $4.6 trillion will come from the public sector. These estimates are based on a bottom-up analysis of 61 use cases, including 21 for the private sector and 40 in the public sector. The private-sector estimate includes both industry-specific and cross-industry use cases, while the public-sector number covers cities, agencies, and verticals such as healthcare, education, and defense.
The four key elements of IoE are:
People: People will continue to connect through devices, like smartphones, PCs and tablets, as well as through social networks, such as Facebook and LinkedIn. As the Internet of Everything emerges, the interaction of people on the Internet will evolve. For example, it may become common to wear sensors on our skin or in our clothes that collect and transmit data to healthcare providers. Some analysts even suggest that people may become individual nodes that produce a constant stream of static data. This creates new data that must be connected and new data means your processes need to change.
Process: This includes evolving technology, business, organizational and other processes that will be needed in order to manage and, to a large extent, automate the explosive growth in connections-and the resultant accumulation, analysis and communication of data-that will be inevitable in the Internet of Everything. Processes will also play an important role in how each of these entities-people, data, and things-interact with each other within the Internet of Everything to deliver societal benefits and economic value.
Data: Today, devices typically gather data and stream it over the Internet to a central source, where it is analyzed and processed. As the capabilities of things connected to the Internet continue to advance, they will become more intelligent and overcome the limits of traditional batch-oriented data analysis by combining data into more useful information. Rather than just reporting raw data, connected things will soon send higher-level information and insights back to machines, computers, and people in real time for further evaluation and decision making. This transformation made possible by the emergence of the Internet of Everything is important because it will enable faster, more intelligent decision making by people and machines, as well as more effective control over our environment.
Things: This element includes many physical items like sensors, meters, actuators, and other types of devices that can be attached to any object, that are or will be capable of connecting to the network and sharing information. These things will sense and deliver more data, respond to control inputs, and provide more information to help people and machines make decisions.
With Indian companies gaining access to technology and innovations that level the playing field, such as cloud computing, what really matters is how the companies harness these innovations to maximise value realised from IoE.
The Cisco Technology Awards and the IoE Tech Talk Panel Discussion series in partnership with ET NOW Television Network was launched earlier this year to assess how companies in India are harnessing the power of the Internet of Everything.
The first edition of the Cisco Technology Awards, presented by ET Now turned out to be an ideal platform to encourage, recognize and reward those organisations that have a strong technology foundation and are ready to harness the power of Internet of Everything.

Cisco Technology Awards
Recognising companies harnessing the power of IoE
In its 30 years as the leader in networking, Cisco has developed the most extensive partnerships, built the broadest and deepest networking portfolio, and cultivated the most certified networking professionals. The company's unmatched expertise in network technology transitions makes it uniquely positioned to help customers capture the value of IoE. Cisco and its partners have helped customers to take advantage of IoE in order to improve customer experience, fuel innovation, increase efficiency, create new markets, unlock intelligence and minimize risk.
In a bid to honour companies driving benefits from Internet of Everything, the Cisco Technology Awards was launched in May this year. An eminent jury consisting of Dr. Nilay Yajnik, professor & chairman, Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, Ms. Aruna Jayanthi, CEO, Capgemini India; Mr. Som Mittal, former chairman & president, NASSCOM; and Mr. Girish Paranjpe, operating partner, Advent International along with EY, as the process partner successfully combed through the entries to select the winners. Winners in 6 unique categories and 2 special award winners were recognised at an extravagant event on the 30th of July this year at Taj Lands End Hotel in Mumbai. The chief guest, Ms. Arundhati Bhattacharya, Chairman of SBI honored the awardees.
The idea of this platform was to encourage, recognise and reward those organisations that have a strong technology foundation and are getting ready to harness the power of the Internet of Everything.
As networks evolve along with the Internet of Everything, the ability to make intelligent decisions based on data as it enters and flows over the Internet will be more distributed (located wherever it's needed). With this ability, security threats, for example, could not only be stopped, but also identified and located before any harm is done.
Cisco's unmatched expertise in network technology transitions makes it uniquely positioned to help customers capture the value of IoE. Only Cisco has the ability to build, manage, and secure an IP-based platform with open standards - from the cloud to end devices.
Robust security capabilities (both logical and physical) and privacy policies are critical enablers of the Internet of Everything. Companies will need to combine technology with effective processes and policies. To benefit from IoE, organizations will need to identify new privacy models that meet company/agency and customer/citizen expectations.
As technological, social and economic advancements continue, the Internet of Everything will present us with challenges, exciting revelations and innovative opportunities.
The next edition of Cisco Technology awards expects to see greater stories and innovations unfold within the Indian business landscape.
The winners of the Cisco Technology Awards announced on July 30, 2014.

Ignore volatility but India Inc sales may not surge in Q2: Pramerica08:00 am
Ignore short-term volatility and continue to remain invested in the market, is the word coming in from BP Singh of Pramerica Mutual Fund. He, however, does not rule out short-term corrections in the market. According to him, every bull run is always accompanied by very sharp short-term corrections. "But investors should ignore this, pick their stocks and stay invested," he says.
He says fundamentals are improving fasted than anticipated.
Singh says the Indian rupee has appreciated against most currencies, on the back of which exports may take a hit and export-oriented companies may see some discomfort. But all these issues are likely to be short-term.
Also Read: Bubble in everything, everywhere: Marc Faber
He continues to remain positive on IT on the belief that the sector is still undervalued.
He expects company financials to improve from the third quarter of next calendar year. In the second quarter of this fiscal year, he expects companies to report improvement in operating margin, but not in topline.
Below is the verbatim transcript of BP Singh's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Sonia: It has become a little tricky for the market now, volatility has crept in. What do you suggest the average investor do at this point, wait on the sidelines or is it still a good time to be going and buying good quality names?
A: Yes, I do agree with you that there are volatilities every day if you look into the market but if you keep comparing week-on-week or month-on-month performance, you notice that the market is going up and so investor is making money if they are invested and they just ignore the volatility. That is a typical of any bull market that there are going to be more people who will continue to doubt whether this rally is sustainable, whether any small event is going to affect it. But let us not ignore that there are many who were sitting on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity to get in.
What we are going through in the last one to one and a half months is if you look at the dollar index, it has appreciated considerably vis-à-vis the various currencies and Indian currency has hold on to it. What clearly indicates that the Indian market is now trying to separate itself from the global markets. So there is really a genuine fundamental rally, which is going on. Now we will see the earnings, which will follow with a lag effect, investors will continue to doubt it but month-on-month we will continue to make money. So we will ignore this, we will recommend people to ignore this short-term volatilities and continue to remain invested, pick your stocks and continue to back it.
Latha: The FII pipe was clearly keeping the stocks fuelled. Now if nobody is buying at - fresh money is not coming in at 8,200 or 8,180 levels, do you see the index continuing to charge ahead? After all we are told that eight months in a row is a very rare occurrence for the Nifty to rise. Therefore, do you think that we are in for some short-term correction but certainly money to be made in six months?
A: I don’t rule out short-term corrections in the market. For example, the simple fact is that the Indian rupee has now appreciated vis-à-vis practically most of the currencies in the world. If that is the case then the exports are either going to come under pressure or the currency will have to give in. Now if either of the situation you will find that the markets might get in for a small correction. But why is that happening? That is happening because the investors are finding this particular market attractive. You cannot have both the things together when your market gets attractive at the same time your currency continues to weaken up. So if you combine these factors, you will notice that every bull market rally is accompanied with a very sharp correction, which is going to be a short-term.
My only advise at this point in time is that how we are planning our portfolio and we are ignoring those short-terms because when we try to focus too much on those short-term corrections, we end up missing the bigger picture, the bigger rally. We are continuing to focus on that bigger rally because the fundamentals are improving much faster than what many people anticipated.
Sonia: In the past couple of weeks, we have seen some defensive moves on the market, IT names like  TCS etc have charged ahead, do you think that one should now up their exposure to the defensive names because there could be lot of volatility in the weeks to come?
A: What is happening is that the top-down India has suddenly started looking attractive but when you look bottom-up, you will still not see the earnings. So as a result of which the investors who are coming to the market are rather continuing to focus on the defensives thinking that I need to be in this particular market because the market is rallying but at the same time, they are looking for more conviction. Now, what will happen that the bottom of the earnings will start improving with a little bit of lag effect. For example, auto -- if you are discussing just three-four months ago, many people wouldn’t have recommended the auto ancillaries but today the auto ancillaries are one of the favourite stocks.
Similarly, for the cement sector - various such sectors are now picking up. So yes, I completely agree with you that the initial flow, which is taking place into defensive side will gradually move towards other sectors. That phase is going to be slightly with a lag because initial money is all getting concentrated and there is still some amount of scope left in the IT sector and we ourselves are very positive on the sector right now because we clearly see undervaluation,. However, as far as the pharmaceutical sector is concerned, as far as the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) is concerned, in our opinion, the overvaluation is now building in and I think we are gradually now looking to get out of this and move into the other sectors.

After a lower start at 27,008.12, the 30-share BSE index dipped below 27,000 to touch a low of 26,918.93, down over 170 points. Buying after mid-session, however, lifted the Sensex to settle at 27,206.74, logging a gain of 116.32 points, or 0.43 per cent.
On Friday, the index had fallen 21.79 points, snapping two consecutive days of gain.
Besides ITC, Tata Motors and ONGC that gained in 3-4 per cent range, major Sensex gainers included Hindustan Unilever, SBI, Axis Bank, Hero MotoCorp, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto, GAIL, HDFC and TCS.
The broader 50-share National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty, after slipping below the 8,100-level to touch a low of 8,064.80, bounced back to close 24.85 points (or 0.31 per cent) higher at 8,146.30.
Both Sensex and Nifty, which were struggling to maintain 27,000 and 8,100 respectively in early trade, managed to close above these levels.
"A fresh spell of buying in recent under-performers was a notable feature of today's session," said Deepak Pahwa, a Delhi-based broker.
Short covering ahead of monthly expiry on Thursday was also seen in select blue-chip stocks, traders said.
The Small-cap index was up 0.51 per cent and Mid-cap rose by 0.20 per cent, indicating continued retail investor interest.
Buying activity also picked up momentum in non-Sensex stocks. Gitanjali Gems, PC Jewellers, Petronet LNG, Jaiprakash Associates and PPAP Automotive, among others, logged gains.
A weak closing in Asian stocks and a lower opening in Europe on reports that China dampened speculation on a potential, however, capped the gains on domestic bourses.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 6.53 crore last Friday as per provisional data.
Sectorally, the BSE Consumer Durables sector index gained the most by surging 3.12 per cent, followed by FMCG index (1.90 per cent), Auto index (1.10 per cent), Oil & Gas index (0.88 per cent), and Banking index (0.29 per cent).

Mamata s nephew mocks Jadavpur University protest  sparks rowWB govt to probe Jadavpur University molestation
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Kolkata, September 22, 2014
First Published: 12:03 IST(22/9/2014) | Last Updated: 17:56 IST(22/9/2014)

After wide protests by students, the West Bengal government Monday announced a probe into the alleged sexual harassment of a female student of Jadavpur University.
"The panel headed by, Suranjan Das, vice-chancellor of Calcutta University will submit its report by Thursday morning," said Education Minister Partha Chatterjee, who met the victim at her residence.
The five-member panel includes eminent Indologist Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri and West Bengal School Service Commission Chairman Subiresh Bhattacharya.
While the university formed a panel to investigate the alleged incident where a female student was dragged into the boys' hostel and molested last month, the students have been demanding an independent probe panel.

Earlier Trinamool Congress Yuva president and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee,  triggered fresh controversy by taking a dig at the Jadavpur University  students’ agitation on his Facebook page.  
 
Abhisek's post has lent a fresh dimension to the controversy that is raging across West Bengal over the past few days following an alleged crackdown of the police on JU students last Tuesday.
 
“The students are agitating as there has been a crackdown against consumption of booze, ganja and charas on the Jadavpur University campus,” wrote Abhishek in a Facebook post in Bengali.
 
Twenty-seven-year old Abhishek is the Lok Sabha MP from Diamond Harbour constituency in South 24 Parganas district.
 
Incidentally, last week chief minister Mamata Banerjee described the JU agitation as a "small matter" during a ceremony in Kolkata.
 
"A mountain is being made out of a molehill," said the chief minister.
 
While most students and teachers of the JU say Banerjee's comment is an attempt to break the movement, some feel that the remark is an outcome of the immense pressure on the party from the media and growing sections of the civil society.
 
 “What is evident from the Facebook post updated by Trinamool Congress youth wing president is that he is not aware of JU’s global standing. Every student dreams of getting admission to JU after the higher secondary examination. It is showing that the ruling party is under a lot of pressure,” said a student of the university.
 
"The culture of the ruling party has deteriorated to such depths that it is impossible for them to appreciate the language of the JU students' protest," said Srutinath Praharaj, leader of West Bengal College and University Teachers' Association, a Left-leaning teacher's organisation.
 
“It is extremely disappointing to see a post like this. This is nothing but an attempt to break our movement,” added Nilanjana Gupta, another teacher.
 
Politicians from opposing parties too joined in condemning Abhisek’s post.
 
“First they said Maoists were behind the incident. When they found thousands of students from all campuses were joining the agitation, they shifted that stance. Now they have found Trinamool Congress is losing support on this question, and therefore, they are resorting to such allegations,” said state BJP president Rahul Sinha.
 
"They can't think of anything beyond alcohol. It is just an attempt to malign the movement," said CPI(M) central committee leader, Md Selim.
 
JU students have been protesting demanding the resignation of the vice-chancellor, the pro V-C and the registrar of the university in the wake of alleged police assault on students early on September 17.
 
Thousands of students had marched through the city's streets on Saturday demanding resignation of JU vice-chancellor Abhijit Chakrabarti and West Bengal governor KN Tripathi intervened to end the four-day old stalemate in the prestigious educational institution.
 
Students from Presidency University, Calcutta University and other educational institutions joined the march in a show of solidarity.
 
JU students have boycotted classes to press the demand for the V-C's resignation. Those in the mass communication department boycotted their examination on September 18.

Investors are busy buying stocks of gold jewellery companies ahead of festivals like Diwali, Dhanteras and wedding season. Tracking a weak global trend, gold prices also fell 0.36 percent to Rs 26,605 per 10 grams in futures market today as speculators trimmed their positions.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in December was down by Rs 95, or 0.36 percent, to Rs 26,605 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 26 lots. Similarly, the yellow metal for delivery in October lost Rs 90, or 0.32 per cent, to Rs 26,406 per 10 grams in 354
lots.
Analysts said the fall in gold futures was mostly in line with a weakening trend in the global market where metal prices fell to an eight-month low as the outlook for higher US borrowing costs strengthened the dollar, dampening demand for a store of value. Gold sales are expected to rise by 15 percent to 20 percent this festive season from year-ago levels.
According to experts, India's monthly gold imports are set to rise by as much 50 percent from current levels while premiums could almost double as the country gears up for a surge in demand ahead of the year-end festivities and wedding season.
Last week, Sanjeev Bhatia, CFO, PC Jeweller said in an interview to CNBC-TV18 that the upcoming festive season can be expected to be a bumper one.
“Now what we are seeing, the things are returning back to normal, people are coming back and the gold prices are stable. What we are witnessing is a back in the consumer footfalls as well as up going sales and more conversion of footfalls into sales as well. If the same trend continues then the upcoming festive season can be expected to be a bumper one,” he said.

IFCI plans to raise Rs 2 000 cr via long term bonds in Q3IFCI to raise Rs 2,000 cr via long-term bonds in Q3
Abhijit Lele | Mumbai Sep 23, 2014 12:19 AM IST
Delhi-based government-owned finance company IFCI plans to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore through 10-year bonds to finance medium and long-term projects.
IFCI has been incrementally raising funds mostly from banks at base rate plus a spread of 25 basis points, while the share of low-cost capital market borrowings in incremental funding has been low.
Malay Mukherjee, CEO and managing director, IFCI, said it would be ready with resources when demand picks up in the second half. Although fresh project proposals are small in number, sanctioned credit is to the tune of Rs 3,600 crore.
The ground work for the proposed bond offering is underway and it would soon be filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). According to an IFCI executive, who did not wish to be named, the offering could hit the market in the third quarter of the current financial year.
When asked about the preference to tap the market, Mukherjee said IFCI could raise cheap funds from the capital market compared with banks, which lend at rates above the base rate.
At present, the base rate for most banks is above 10 per cent, while the yield on a 10-year paper is of 8.50 per cent. Thus, the money raised from banks would carry lending rate in excess of 10.25 per cent, whereas bonds with a tenure of 10 years and more would attract coupon rate 8.5 per cent, giving a saving of at least 150 basis points.
IFCI’s ability to raise funds at competitive cost through capital market instruments would be critical for its competitiveness.
IFCI’s liquidity profile remains comfortable, on the back of long-dated borrowings and sizeable liquid investments, as reflected in no-negative cumulative mismatches in any of the buckets as on March 2014.
During FY14, IFCI reported a net profit of Rs 508 crore on a total income of Rs 2,951 crore. The total loan portfolio stood at Rs 18,635 crore as on March 31, 2014.

CBI seeks time to clarify on Hindalco closure reportCBI seeks time for clarifications in case against Birla, others

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday sought more time in a Delhi court to give clarifications on queries posed to it in connection with a closure report filed in coal block allocation case in which an FIR was lodged against top industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla and others.
Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) R S Cheema told Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar that the DIG and SP concerned were not available and therefore, he needed some more time to address the arguments in the matter.
The court allowed the submission of Cheema and posted the matter for hearing on October 13. SPP seeks more time before addressing arguments. Put up the matter for October 13, the judge said. The court was hearing the closure report filed by CBI in its FIR lodged against Birla, former Coal Secretary P C Parakh and others.
On September 12, the court had asked CBI as to what was the hurry in  closing the case in which FIR was registered against Birla, Parakh and  others.
The observation of the court had come after the investigating officer (IO) in the case had contended that the original minutes of meeting of screening committee, in which Birla-owned Hindalco's application seeking allocation of coal blocks was dealt with, were missing.
The agency had told the court that it has already lodged a PE (preliminary enquiry) regarding the missing documents. CBI had on August 28 filed a closure report in the case.
The FIR against Birla , Parakh and others was registered in October last year by CBI which had alleged that Parakh had reversed his decision to reject coal block allocation to Hindalco within months without any valid basis or change in circumstances and shown undue favours.
The FIR relates to allocation of Talabira II and III coal blocks in 2005.
CBI had booked Birla, Parakh and other officials of Hindalco under various IPC sections, including criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct on the part of government officials. In its FIR, the agency had alleged that during the 25th Screening Committee meeting, chaired by Parakh, applications of Hindalco and Indal Industries were rejected for mining in Talabira II and III citing valid reasons.

Railgate: Ex-Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal appears as witnessPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 12:53 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 2:47 pm
Bansal, who resigned in May last year as Railway Minister after the matter came to light, was named as a prosecution witness in the case.
Former Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal Monday appeared in a Delhi court to depose as a prosecution witness in the Rs 10 crore cash-for-post railway bribery case in which his nephew is also an accused.
Prior to recording his statement Special CBI Judge Swarana Kanta Sharma asked media persons present there to vacate the court room during the proceedings.
Bansal had appeared pursuant to the court’s fresh summons issued on September 16, when it had made it clear that no exemption from personal appearance would be given to him on the next date.
On the last date of hearing, Bansal had sought exemption on medical grounds.
Bansal was summoned as a prosecution witness in the case in which his nephew Vijay Singla, suspended Railway Board member Mahesh Kumar and eight others are facing trial.
He had not appeared before the court on the last date of hearing and his counsel Puneet Ahluwalia had told the judge that the Congress leader was unwell as he was suffering from viral fever and he would appear on any date after September 19.
Bansal, who resigned in May last year as Railway Minister after the matter came to light, was named as a prosecution witness in the case.
The court had commenced the trial in the case on September 15 in which CBI had charge sheeted 10 accused last year.
The court had on March 11 this year framed charges against all the accused under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC read with provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act.
The court had framed charges against Singla, then Member (Staff) of Railway Board Mahesh Kumar, Managing Director of Bangalore-based G G Tronics India Pvt Limited N R Manjunath, alleged middlemen Ajay Garg and Sandeep Goyal and co-accused Rahul Yadav, Sameer Sandhir, Sushil Daga, C V Venugopal and M V Murali Krishan.
CBI had alleged that Singla had demanded Rs 10 crore from Kumar for his appointment as Member (Electrical) and it was decided between the accused that Rs 5 crore will be paid before the appointment and the rest after the job was done.
It had claimed first tranche of around Rs 90 lakh was given to Singla who was apprehended while accepting the money.

Telecom M&A guidelines need to be reworked: ...M&A
(It’s been more than six…)
NEW DELHI: The telecom regulator on Monday was critical of mergers and acquisitions guidelines that didn't facilitate muchneeded consolidation.
"DoT (Department of Telecommunications) issued some M&A guidelines. These guidelines are a non-starter and no M&A can take place within those guidelines," said Rahul Khullar, chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).
"I think the industry is in dire need of consolidation and it can't go on this way," Khullar added, while speaking at an 'open house' discussion with the telecom industry. The session was on pricing of airwaves in the 1800 Mhz and 900 Mhz bands that would likely be auctioned early next year.
It's been more than six months since the previous UPA government issued revised M&A rules but there hasn't been a single major deal. There has only been the odd Bharti Airtel-Loop Mobile subscriber and infrastructure sale deal for the Mumbai circle that is yet to be cleared by DoT. None of the reported M&A talks between Tata and Vodafone, Tata and Uninor or a three-way deal among Tata, Aircel and Sistema have fructified so far.
The new M&A rules had raised the cap on the market share of a merged entity in a circle to 50% from 35% earlier, but retained a contentious clause that requires a buyer to pay market-linked prices for spectrum that comes with any acquisition. This clause, most operators said, was the biggest factor behind deals not being inked, as it raised the cost of acquisition.
Other hurdles included a clause that allowed a merged entity to hold a maximum of 25% spectrum allocated in a service area and 50% in a particular band. This practically ruled out the big three - Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular - from striking a deal among themselves but allowed them to do so with smaller operators but only in limited circles. The clause however allowed the smaller operators to combine among themselves.
"The industry is bleeding. There are 12 operators here. Globally, each country has three to four telecom service providers. Some places it is just two. Despite notifying, no consolidation has happened," Khullar said. He was referring to how the intense competition has led to smaller operators running up thousands of crores of debt, a deterrent for any potential suitors.
  Apart from the lacunae in the M&A rules, those on other modes of direct or indirect consolidation - spectrum trading and sharing -are yet to be cleared by the DoT, despite Trai having recommended these months back.
Trading allows operators to sell airwaves that they aren't utilising. This offers an exit route for a struggling operator apart from an M&A deal. Sharing on the other hand allows operators to pool resources without selling to one another. Both though provide another avenue for stronger operators to beef up their bandwidth holdings, without having to take part in auctions, and could allow weaker players a way to monetise their spectrum assets.
"We have already submitted our recommendation and the telecom department now has to come out with the rules on sharing and trading of airwaves to pave consolidation of the sector," Khullar said. The government though has recently said that sharing and trading rules will be out by the year end.
The industry on its part requested the regulator to speak to DoT for an early notification of the spectrum trading and sharing rules before the government auctioned airwaves.
Separately, the GSM operators said the reserve price for 900 MHz in the forthcoming spectrum auction should be same as that for the 800 MHz band used by CDMA players because both the bands have similar propagation characteristics.
"We propose that the reserve price of 800 MHz band as finally accepted by the government based on the Trai's recommendations dated February 2014 shall be used for 900 MHz band also," Bharti Airtel said.
Trai has recommended a pan-India reserve price of Rs 2,685 crore per Mhz for 800 MHz band, typically used for offering CDMA services. The GSM players were of the view that 800 MHz and 900 MHz spectrum have similar propagation characteristics and are being used for the deployment of broadband technologies such as 3G and LTE. "The coverage in 900 MHz is roughly double that in 1800 MHz. The reduction in capital and operational expenditure could be as much as 40%. Operations in the 800 MHz band enjoy similar advantages," Vodafone India added.

ISRO’s Mars orbiter enters Mars’ Sphere of Influence
Agencies
space programme
Cruising towards its historic rendezvous with the Red Planet, India’s Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) on Monday entered Mars’ gravitational Sphere of Influence ahead of its scheduled Orbit Insertion on September 24.
“Our navigators’ calculations show that MOM has entered the gravitational Sphere of Influence of Mars,” ISRO said on its social networking site, adding, the spacecraft was within 5.4 lakh km radius of the Mars’ gravitational Sphere of Influence.
The crucial fourth trajectory correction manoeuvre and test fire of the Main Liquid Engine on the spacecraft is scheduled for 2.30 PM today.
“We will also be test firing the main liquid fuel engine beneath the spacecraft for nearly four seconds to reactivate, as it was switched off after its trans-Mars injection over nine months ago into the Sun’s orbit for its voyage through the inter-planetary space,” Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Scientific Secretary V. Koteshwara Rao said.
Now that the spacecraft has entered the Mars’ influence, its velocity has to be controlled so that it does not escape the Mars’ influence, an official said, adding, the spacecraft is scheduled to enter the Mars Orbit Insertion at 7.30 AM IST on September 24.

CBI chief s guest list: SC seeks help of SPPComments
The Supreme Court  on Monday sought the assistance of Special Public Prosecutor in the 2G case to decide a plea filed against  CBI director Ranjit Sinha in the visitors' list controversy.
The apex court directed that all the documents including the CBI's file notings and visitors' register of the director's residence be given to the SPP.
The view of the SPP has to be considered as any order by the court would have ramification in the 2G cases, the Supreme Court said.
The court also agreed  to hear lawyer-activist Prashant Bhushan's  plea against the SC order that he name the whistleblower who provided him the guest list. Bhushan's NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), tendered an unconditional apology before the court for its inability to reveal the name of the whistleblower.
Last week, he had informed the court that he could not name the whistleblower, as this would endanger his life.The CBI chief however argued that the identity of the mole should be disclosed before the apex court. The court will hear the case further on October 10.
Providing no relief to Ranjit Sinha, the SC turned down his plea  that the case filed against him should not be heard and be dismissed. Bhushan had alleged that the visitor's list at the CBI chief's residence showed that he frequently met the accused in the 2G and coal scam cases, and hence the probes were compromised.  
The CBI chief told the court that there had not been any interference by the agency in any of the probes.

CNN India correspondent analyses PM Modi's persona
29
1
Editor's note: Ravi Agrawal is CNN's New Delhi bureau chief. He was part of the CNN team that exclusively spent time with Narendra Modi in his first interview since becoming India's Prime Minister. Follow him on Twitter.
New Delhi (CNN): Four months ago Narendra Modi emerged as the runaway winner of the world's biggest election in history. It was a surprising, overwhelming mandate for his Bharatiya Janata Party: no other Indian party had won a clear majority in parliament in three decades. Modi was the clear face of the party, the man millions of Indians believed could better their lives.
But who is Narendra Modi? What makes him tick? How has he evolved in his first role on the national stage? And what is his vision for India's foreign policy?
He writes that Modi has a lot of sense of humour and unlike most other world leaders, Modi is easy going.
#the modi interview #narendra modi #bharatiya janata party #bjp
Modi has has not done any media interviews since becoming PM. Until now. CNN's Fareed Zakaria conducted the network's exclusive interview. As part of the CNN team that was there at the PM's residence at 7 Race Course Road, I got to spend a bit of time observing India's new, enigmatic, all-powerful leader.
A lot has been written about Modi in the last year. What hasn't gotten enough press -- a result of the lack of access -- is what PM Modi is like up close. Here are some thoughts about what I found interesting.
Modi's lighter side
Modi has a reputation -- at least in the press -- of being a serious man, an intimidating presence. Having never met him before, I was struck by his lighter side. Modi had a natural, easy sense of humor, the likes of which I've rarely seen when producing interviews with world leaders. When we were setting up for the interview, I asked him to do an audio test for us.
"What should I say?"
I asked him to count to ten.
"You're testing my primary education as well today?"
The tension broke; both sides were laughing.
Twenty minutes through the interview, we realized Modi's forehead had gotten shiny, perhaps because of the intense lighting. I stopped the interview, and asked our makeup artist to touch him up. "My sweat is the product of sixty years of toil, my friends," Modi announced to the room. "Sixty seconds of makeup isn't going to help me!" Again, laughter all round. Modi was playing to the gallery.
On foreign policy
There were serious moments as well. One of the things India-watchers asked when Modi was elected was how quickly he would adapt to the global stage. Modi, after all, had little experience in international diplomacy.
I've previously written about how Modi has been quick off the block in engaging leaders of other countries. What struck me about Modi in person was how his foreign policy is rooted not in international relations theory, but in history.
On China, Modi repeatedly referred to India's historical ties with China, and how the two countries had for centuries risen and fallen in sync.
When asked if he was worried about China's growing assertiveness in territorial disputes in the East China and South China Seas, Modi said: "India is different. It is a country of 1.25 billion people. We can't run our country if we get worried about every small thing."
"At the same time we can't close our eyes to problems. We're not living in the 18th century. This is an era of partnership. Everyone will have to seek and extend help mutually. China is also a country with an ancient cultural heritage," he added.
Modi pointed out how the world had changed since the 18th century. Back then, countries thought horizontally: they wanted to expand. Today, they think vertically, about building up their economies.
Certainly, the suggestion Modi made was that he was thinking vertically -- and he was expecting his neighbors to do the same.
Right or left?
Journalists often describe Modi as a politician of the right. He's pro-business, nationalist, talks about a leaner, smaller government, doesn't want to raise taxes. Indeed, he may be all of those things. But perhaps the left-or-right prism is a Western one, best applied to developed economies.
Modi struck me as a populist. He candidly talked about growing up poor, about traveling around the country and learning about life from coversations with regular people. He defended India's policy on subsidies.
For rich countries, subsidies are a political agenda, he said. "For poor countries, subsidies are a matter of life or death." Modi explained he was not going to budge on bringing in FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in retail (a change many economists have called for) because he believed in a different kind of FDI -- First Develop India.
Work
At the start of our interview, Modi told us about his working life. He said he wakes up at 5 a.m. every morning -- a childhood routine --and often stays up working and reading until anywhere from 10pm to two in the morning.
So, how does he unwind, asked Fareed. The answer surprised me. Modi used an analogy of a scientist obsessed with his laboratory; his passion keeps him in the lab all day and all night. That, Modi said, was how he felt about governance. "Work gives me relaxation too ... I draw pleasure in governance, in doing new things and bringing people together. That pleasure is all I need from life."
Rhetoric
One thing I wasn't surprised by was Modi's rhetoric. Up close, his speech and rhetoric are as impressive as it had seemed to be on the campaign trail and on TV.
He had clearly prepared thoroughly for questions he thought an international broadcaster might ask. He knew the right things to say--even off camera.
But great rhetoric also means great expectations. It's too soon to judge Modi on results. For sure, CNN will be back later to ask and check if he has delivered.

Allahabad: Supporters of BJP MP Varun Gandhi protested against party colleague Shyama Charan Gupta for criticising his mother Maneka Gandhi by pelting stones at his Allahabad residence on Monday.
Gupta, who is the Allahabad MP, had chided Maneka Gandhi for her remarks that Varun Gandhi should be brought back in Uttar Pradesh politics.
The Allahabad MP had said, "It is a statement made in haste. She should not have said this. Like her others will also pitch in for their children."
Gupta, who is the Allahabad MP, had chided Maneka Gandhi for her remarks that Varun Gandhi should be brought back in Uttar Pradesh politics.

When asked whether the Sultanpur MP has the capability to run the state, Gupta said, "There are many who are capable enough."
Maneka had backed her son after the BJP fared badly in the Uttar Pradesh bypolls. On the question of mother and son trying to project each other in the state, Gupta said, "They are not right in doing so."

Indefinite strike in Meghalaya from Tuesday against NGT s coal mining banThe ban was issued following a complaint by the All Dimasa Students’ Union of the adjoining Dima Hasao district of Assam, which contended that rat-hole mining in Meghalaya had polluted the Kopili river. Source: PTI
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: September 22, 2014 3:17 pm
Four months after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered a ban on ‘rat-hole’ coal mining in Meghalaya, an organization called Movement for Indigenous Peoples’ Rights and Livelihood-Meghalaya (MIPRL) has called for an indefinite economic strike from Tuesday demanding withdrawal of that order.
The NGT had on April 17 issued orders to the state government to immediately stop rat-hole and other illegal coal mining, as also transportation of coal extracted through such methods. The ban was issued following a complaint by the All Dimasa Students’ Union of the adjoining Dima Hasao district of Assam, which contended that rat-hole mining in Meghalaya had polluted the Kopili river and turned its water poisonous.
While this ban has been opposed by various organizations including political parties on the ground that it had affected livelihood of thousands of people out of job, the MIPRL also complained against lack of response from the Meghalaya government to this major economic issue.
MIPRL spokesman Erwin K Syiem Sutnga said in Shillong that while said that the group had submitted a list of ten issues to the Meghalaya chief minister with a 10-day deadline, there was no response from him. “The state government even failed to make any proper presentation during the NGT’s hearing on September 16 despite demand by so many organizations to it to pray for relaxation of the guidelines,” he said.
The MIPRL has also demanded implementation of Para 12 A Sub Para (b) of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India to protect the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo Peoples’ inalienable and absolute rights over tribal land. Its other demands included modification of all central laws applied to the state of Meghalaya done without recourse to the mandatory provisions of Para 12 A Sub Para (b) and (d).
“The government of Meghalaya continues to play with the lives and survival of thousands of people who have bee rendered jobless. We had no option left but to call an economic strike,” Sutnga said.
The MIPRL has asked all transporters of goods in and outside Meghalaya, all petroleum product tankers, limestone exporters and traders, all passenger transporters, carriers, transporters of timber, cement, clinker and coal, among others, to support the economic strike call. The strike will however not affect private and small commercial vehicles within Meghalaya, Sutnga said. It would also not affect schools, colleges, offices, markets, he added.
Meanwhile, an expert committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has permitted transportation of coal already extracted before issue of the ban order, but under strict 21-point environmental guidelines continued…

Gold-silver price ratio may fall as gold cools fasterGold
(Gold has been on a downtrend…)
MUMBAI: The price of gold might fall more than that of silver this year, taking the price ratio between the two precious metals back towards its five-year average.
Gold has been on a downtrend as pickup in global economies has reduced demand for this safe asset. This may offer music to the ears of Indian consumers, as they begin to purchase jewellery for the festival and marriage seasons.
ET data show the gold-silver ratio averaged 55.71 in the five years through end-2013. This means 55.71 kg of silver is needed to purchase a kilogram of gold. But, year-to-date, this ratio has climbed to 65.26, as silver has become more undervalued.
The ratio was calculated based on average annual prices of front month gold and silver contracts on Multi Commodity Exchange .
Broking officials like Suresh Nair, executive director of Admisi Commodities, expect the ratio to probably decline, which means gold might fall sharper than silver.
Most leading analysts predict bearishness for the yellow metal as the US central bank could raise its benchmark Fed funds rate at a faster pace of interest rate hikes than previously projected. That could boost the dollar, leading investors to shift out of gold-backed assets to dollar ones.
Goldman Sachs has forecast gold to decline to $1,050 an ounce this year from low $1,200 levels.
"Gold is not expected to deliver gains for some time as economic conditions continue to improve," Cameron Alexander, manager, precious metals demand, Asia, at GFMS Commodities Research & Forecasts, told ET. "Investors are looking to other asset classes which are currently offering healthier returns. We may see inflationary pressures begin to build in the back half of next year which will be supportive for the yellow metal, but currently there is little that is attracting traders. The physical market remain weak as the professional market is with expectation of weaker prices keeping many on the sidelines."
Indian consumers might not benefit as much from lower international rates
The generic first-month gold futures traded on Comex, part of the US CME group, has fallen by 12% from a high of $1,379 an ounce on March 14 to $1,211.60 intraday on Monday. In comparison, the generic front-month futures that trades on domestic commodity bourse MCX has dropped just 9.6% to Rs 26,350 per 10 gm intraday on Monday from its high on March 24. This is because the rupee has depreciated a bit against the dollar. Since India imports the yellow metal, a weaker rupee cushions a fall in gold price while a stronger local unit makes the metal cheaper.
The front-month gold contract, with 1% tax added, reflects the spot price on the local market.
"While the international price is expected to decline, it's quite likely that Indian consumers might not witness a concomitant fall in rupee prices of gold," added Nair. "That's because the local currency could play spoilsport."
Consumer demand is currently tepid with the inauspicious period of Pitru Paksh under way from September 8 to September 23, when many Hindus pay homage to their ancestors and refrain from making purchases.

It may or may not be the most important meal of the day for personal health, but one thing’s for sure: Gone are the days when Americans relied on cereal with milk and a side of orange juice to kickstart their mornings. So, too, are the days when General Mills and Kellogg could coast on profits from Wheaties and Cornflakes.
The New York Times’ recent reporting on the decline of cold cereal in the US , then, has been a long time coming. In fact, US cereal sales have been off their peak for about two decades now. But the decline has suddenly accelerated , focusing new attention on America’s changing breakfast habits.
A desire for portability—being able to eat breakfast on the way to work or school—is one factor. Then there are those persnickety millennials , who either  don’t eat breakfast at all, hate processed food , are embracing Paleo , or are allergic to gluten . But perhaps cereal’s biggest obstacle now is this: Consumers are going crazy for protein. More than half of Americans want more of it in their diets , and a quarter of them examine nutrition labels specifically for information about a food’s protein content. At home, they’re gobbling up Greek yogurt. Away, they’re now finding an array of egg-and-cheese wraps, sandwiches, and scrambles at full- and quick-serve restaurants.
If it feels like yogurt has taken over the dairy case at your local supermarket, you aren’t imagining things.

The breakfast cereal category has remained stagnant, while yogurt (including drinkable, spoonable, plain, fruity, Greek, etc.) is on the rise.
Greek yogurt, in particular,  has become  such a popular source of protein that it’s being tested as a new Taco Bell “Power” breakfast menu item —a prime example of the menu enhancements and marketing prowess that restaurants are employing to draw more breakfast eaters out of the home and into the restaurant booth (or, in many cases, the drive-thru).
Their strategies are working. According to market research from NPD Group, US restaurant patrons have been going out for fewer lunches and dinners,  but more breakfasts , than usual, and 2013 was the fourth year in a row that the number of consumer breakfast visits to restaurants increased. Today, “tons of dollars are being spent to convince consumers to try breakfast out of the home,” says Eli Rosenberg of Food Genius, a data company that tracks restaurant trends.
Weekday mornings are  newly competitive turf  for fast-food restaurants, especially, where breakfasts  accounted for 92% of traffic growth between 2007 and 2012 . Why else do you think Taco Bell came up with the Waffle Taco ?
All this has been terrible for cereal sales . Among the 10 best-selling cereals in the US, half saw their sales fall or stagnate in the last 12 months.
General Mills just reported that its US sales are down 5% from last year ; on a Sept. 17 conference call with investors, CEO Ken Powell called the cereal market “challenged.” He’s optimistic about sales of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which increased 7% this year after the cereal was “renovated” for “more cinnamon taste,” and he’s excited about the advent of Cheerios Protein. For now, though, it’s easier for Powell to discuss Yoplait yogurt—sales are up for both the Greek and original varieties.
For those protein-conscious consumers, here are some stats to consider:
One serving of Honey Nut Cheerios with 4 ounces of low-fat milk = 7 grams of protein (4 grams from milk), 15 grams of sugar (6 grams from milk), 170 calories
One single-serving container of fat-free Chobani peach yogurt = 13 grams of protein, 7 grams of sugar, 140 calories
One McDonald’s Egg McMuffin = 17 grams of protein, 3 grams of sugar, 300 calories
Taco Bell egg-and-cheese Waffle Taco = 8 grams of protein, 8 grams of sugar, 260 calories

Tata Sons transfers mutual fund arm to Tata CapitalAnand Adhikari      Follow @anandadhikari    Last Updated: September 22, 2014  | 17:04 IST

Tata Capital, the financial services arm of the $100-billion Tata Group, is taking over the mutual fund (MF) business from the group holding company Tata Sons.
A proposal to transfer the business was taken a few months ago. The idea is to consolidate the financial services business under one roof for focused attention.
One may recall that Tata Sons (not Tata Capital) had applied for a banking licence with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It, however, withdrew its application midway saying it looks forward to participating in the banking sector at an appropriate time.
Clearly, the group has banking ambitions and Tata Capital, a non-banking finance company (NBFC), is best suited to convert into a banking entity.
Tata Capital currently covers retail and commercial finance, including home, car, and two-wheeler loans, wealth management, private equity, travel, forex services, etc. It clocked in revenues of Rs 3,500 crore and a net profit of Rs 353 crore in 2013/14. The company has a loan book of around Rs 29,000 crore.
Sources say the deal was struck at around Rs 150 crore for the 68 per cent stake in the mutual fund arm. Another group company, Tata Investment Corporation, holds the remaining 32.09 per cent stake. It is not known whether Tata Investment is also transferring its stake to Tata Capital.
Tata Investment is purely an investment company with a focus on equity as well as debt investment in the market.
Tata Capital has, however, refused to confirm or deny the deal.
Tata Mutual Fund, meanwhile, has been lagging in the industry with assets under management (AUM) of Rs 21,954 crore in March 2014. The largest player, HDFC Mutual Fund, has an AUM of Rs 1,12,962 crore.
The mutual fund arm has been a profitable company with revenues of Rs 173 crore and net profits of Rs 17 crore in March 2014. The mutual fund business under Tata Asset Management was set up by Tata Sons when the sector was opened up for private players.

Merck KGaA buys US s Sigma-Aldrich for $17 b...German pharmaceuticals maker Merck KGaA said Monday it was buying US speciality chemicals firm Sigma-Aldrich for 13.1 billion euros ($17 billion).
ET SPECIAL:
FRANKFURT: Drugs and chemicals maker Merck KGaA said it agreed to acquire Sigma-Aldrich for $17 billion in cash to boost its Merck Millipore lab supplies business in the biggest takeover in the German group's history, lifting its shares.
The deal, approved by Sigma-Aldrich's management, will see Merck acquire all shares for $140 apiece in cash.
That represents a 37 percent premium over the latest closing price of $102.37 on Sept. 19 and a 36 percent premium to the one-month average closing price, according to Merck.
Family-controlled Merck said on Monday the deal would immediately top up adjusted earnings per share and the margin of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) over sales.
Merck expects to achieve annual synergies of approximately 260 million euros ($334 million), which should be fully realised within three years after closing.
Shares in Merck, which initially turned negative on the news, traded up 5.8 percent at 73.66 euros by 1039 GMT, against a flat European chemicals index.
St Louis, Missouri-based Sigma-Aldrich, which says it is the world's largest supplier of biochemicals and organic chemicals to research laboratories, had 2013 sales of $2.7 billion.
Merck, the largest maker of liquid crystals for TV and computer screens, made lab equipment a major pillar of its business when it purchased U.S. group Millipore for $6 billion in 2010.
Previously, its biggest deal was the takeover of Swiss biotech company Serono, a maker of fertility treatments, for 10.3 billion euros.

Scotland is still closer to independencejust look at QuebecCanada remained unified and Quebec still won. (Reuters/Shaun Best)

You probably saw some long faces on Sept. 18 after the urns were counted in Aberdeen and Inverness and Lochaber and Edinburgh, and the numbers were found to be several percentage points shy of a majority. The dream of Alex Salmond had been evidently dashed, and all those rallies, TV advertisements, and interviews with the cast of Braveheart had apparently been for naught. Twitter was speckled with petty victory dances about how the Scots were probably not be to trusted with a country anyhow, including a surprising one by Glaswegian superstar historian Niall Ferguson, who fretted that his home country would become Europe’s Afghanistan without the steadying hand of their auld colonial betters. Surely, some think, this was just one giant political farce, a waste of time that will warn off future secessionists from dreaming of their own seat at the table of international leadership.
This morose view of last week’s events fails to seize upon a significant implication: Scotland, as a result of the Scottish National Party’s efforts, is closer to independence than it has been since the Battle of Colodin. The post-modern version of national independence tends to come in small steps, changing the infinitely complex global system a bit at a time rather than by “kicking the bastards out” and throwing up a new flag. Scotland is likely to reap a series of concessions from its southern neighbor, the one which just proclaimed filial love for its tartan-clad supposed equal. It will receive independence, though probably not the sort we have come to expect from the geopolitics of the 18th through 20th centuries.
To consider what the subtle version of independence might resemble in the years to come, the best comparison is the nation of Quebec and its relationship to federal Canada after decades of tumultuous agitation toward sovereignty. Compared to what the Québécois experienced as a minority population in their own country, the Scots have little reason to bolt for the secessionist doors. English colonists had no more intrinsic rights to the province of Quebec than their French rivals, but they certainly ended up with all the political, economic and military power. For centuries, the English ran the show, even though the French wielded what is called la revanche du berceau or the revenge of cradle, which used the famous Catholic fecundity to keep the English a demographic minority. For their part, the English were able to maintain places like Montreal, the most important city in Canada, covered in English billboards and Anglo power structures while the people all around them complained bitterly in the joual dialect of French. As the rest of the world violently shook up the social order in the late 1960s, so did the Québécois finally make it clear they would not ignore their rights to self-determination. What came to be known as la Révolution Tranquille, the Quiet Revolution, won major concessions from Ottawa with a minimum of strife.
Unsatisfied, the nationalist movement in la belle province continued to push for referendums on total independence. These took place in 1981 and 1995, with the latter coming within a single percentage point of a majority. There have been major shifts since then. This nationalism sent many businesses to Ontario out of fear of further instability. The referendums led to major changes in Quebec’s healthcare and educational systems, as well as important language laws, such as billboards and documentations legally required to include a certain amount of French. They also peaked the level of tension between the English and French in general.
But in the aftermath, something counterintuitive has emerged: Quebec has enough sovereignty that full nationalism is on the wane. Prior reforms have convinced all but the most ardent nationalist that there is not much more to gain. The aftermath of the referendums 20 years on is far from negative for either camp. The Québécois are maîtres chez eux, or masters in their own home, and if anything Montreal is more of a global city than it was before; its economy, creative scene, tech startups and industrial sectors have never been better in history. The province currently benefits from federal Canada while escaping the acrimony over centuries-old subjugation. It is probably superior to what would have resulted from a shattering of the Canadian federation.
If we look at Quebec’s situation as analogous to their peers across the Atlantic, even last week’s no vote would mean that Scotland gains more sovereignty over key matters in its ancient homeland. The Scottish people have declared themselves to the world as masters of their own destiny—a distinct people, even if not a nation-state with a seat at the UN. Westminster would be foolish to treat this movement as insignificant lest it face another referendum with more determined voters in just a few years. So Alex Salmond’s movement could be light years beyond some failed political stunt, but indeed the first step in post-modern national independence. And frankly, as the Québécois discovered, that might be much more valuable than having to print all new currency.

Oil Ministry again extends deadline for comments on revenue sharingOil Ministry again extends deadline for comments on revenue sharing
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 22:  
The Petroleum Ministry has once again extended the deadline for seeking comments on a simpler revenue sharing contract which it wants to replace the present Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) with.
The Ministry had on August 21 floated a model revenue sharing contract for exploration and production of oil and gas and sought comments from stakeholders by September 10. On September 11 it extended the deadline to September 20. The same has now been extended till the month-end.
“...the timeline for receiving comments on the draft Model Revenue Sharing Contract (MRSC) has been extended up to September 30, 2014,” a Ministry order said.
No reason was assigned for the extension.
Besides suggesting doubling of natural gas prices, a Committee headed by C Rangarajan had suggested moving to a revenue sharing regime where companies bid upfront the quantity of oil and gas they will share with the Government for winning an exploration acreage.
The Ministry accepted this in-principle, and floated a MRSC.
MRSC will replace the current practice of companies getting blocks by bidding maximum work programme and then recovering all of their investment before sharing profits with the Government. This model was criticised by CAG, which said it encouraged companies to keep raising cost so as to postpone higher share of profits to the Government.
In the new regime, the companies will have to indicate the quantity of oil and gas they will share with the Government at different stages of production as well as at different rates.
“The Government’s revenue share of crude oil and/ or natural gas shall be determined based on a two-dimensional production—price matrix, where Government’s revenue share with the contractor(s) shall be linked to the average daily production in a month and average oil and gas prices in a month,” the draft MRSC said.
Besides quoting the quantity they will share with the Government at different levels of production, the companies would also quote the quantum at different price levels — less than $100 per barrel, $100-125, $125—150 and more than $150 per barrel for oil and for gas in bands of less than $6 per million British thermal unit rate, $6—10, $10—14 and more than $14 per mmBtu.
The production levels for on-land, shallow offshore and deepwater have been proposed at different tranches.
Companies will have to bid the amount they will share with the Government at different levels of production as well as different rates for oil and gas.
“In the matrix, production is linked to a sliding scale (incremental) production tranche and price is linked to fixed scale price band,” the draft MRSC said.

GMR inks pact with Nepal Govt for 900-MW hydel project
V Rishi Kumar
Tweet
Hyderabad, Sept 22:  
GMR Group has entered into a Project Development Agreement with the Nepal Government for the 900-MW Upper Karnali Hydro Power Project.
The agreement was signed late last week in the presence of Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, among others.
The project agreement was signed after due approvals from the Board of Investment Board of Nepal and the Nepal Cabinet. This is the largest FDI for Nepal and also the largest investment for GMR Group outside India.
The Upper Karnali Hydro Power Project was awarded to the GMR Group through an International competitive bidding process in 2008. The project entails an investment of about Rs 9,000 crore.
Located on Karnali river, in the Surkhet, Dailekh and Achham districts of Nepal, the 900-MW project is to be constructed in about five years.
The power generated, net of free power and power supply to Nepal, if any, is planned to be evacuated through a 400 kV double circuit transmission line up to the interconnection point of Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) in India.
G M Rao, Group Chairman of GMR Group, in a statement said, “The signing of the Project Development Agreement for the Upper Karnali Hydro Power Project reinforces the strong ties between India and Nepal. The development of the Upper Karnali project will be beneficial for both countries leveraging on each other’s strengths and resources. We are committed to the development of the project and the betterment of the communities in the region.”
The financial closure of the project (long-term tie-up of debt and equity capital) is expected to be achieved before September 2016 and thereafter the commencement of the commercial operation is expected by September 2021.
GMR Group will be exploring strategic/long-term capital tie-up of both debt and equity for the project at an appropriate time.
The project is expected to generate about 3,500 million units (MUs) of energy annually and 420 MUs of energy (12 per cent of installed capacity) has been earmarked as free power to Nepal.
The Nepal Electricity Authority will hold 27 per cent free equity stake in the project, including all project royalties, and the 100 per cent ownership of the project will be transferred to the Government of Nepal, at the end of the 25-year concession period.

Google to help realise Prime Minister Narendra Modis Digital India visionGoogle India will run a number of campaigns as part of the Government of India’s Digital India programme.
Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 4:51 pm
Google India is looking forward to initiate several campaigns to help realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision towards a Digital India. Google is working with the Department of Information Technology and other State Governments to develop key initiatives.
The highlight of these initiatives are as follows:
MyGov, the citizen engagement platform of the Government and Google are collaborating to launch a nationwide contest to develop a mobile app for the PM’s Office. The mobile app will bring the PMO to every citizen and the contest will showcase how Indians can build a world class app
Google India will continue to build a vibrant language ecosystem online and help the Government transition into the increasingly ‘mobile’ India.
Programs such as Helping Women get Online, getting Indian SMEs Online and showcasing India’s rich heritage and culture online will further promote the digital empowerment of citizens.
Additionally, to encourage digital literacy and Internet safety, Google will also introduce curriculum for schools, officials and elected representatives.
“The Digital India Program has been launched with the vision of transforming India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. It can truly transform India and bring it on par with other developed countries. I’m happy Google is coming forward to roll out initiatives that will contribute to the Digital India vision. I’m sure others will come forward and join this moment,” said R.S.Sharma, Secretary of the Department of Information Technology.
“India is already home to the 3rd largest number of internet users globally with 245 million users as of June 2014. We are on track to become the 2nd largest user market by 2015 and a 500 million-user market by 2016. Yet, there are more than a billion people who will need to be brought online for India to realize the vision of a digitally connected, knowledge economy. Prime Minister Modi’s Digital India program will play a transformational role in achieving this, and we are excited to be making a meaningful contribution by rolling out several initiatives in collaboration with the Government of India,” said Rajan Anandan, Vice President and Managing Director, Google India.

Chinas Rs 9 125 crore plans for Indian roads hit speed breakerPrint
New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 4:47 pm
Less than a week into a successful visit by Chinese premier Xi Jinping to India, the Narendra Modi government is likely to reject a proposal received from the neighbouring country to allow its companies to finance and construct nine highway projects here.
Top government officials privy to the development said that the matter has already been discussed in the road transport and highways ministry, and it would soon communicate its views to the Chinese counterparts that investment under the model suggested by them would not be feasible.
China proposed to take up construction of 890 kms of highways (nine in number) worth Rs 9,125 crore that government planned to award under engineering construction and procurement (EPC) basis during Chinese president’s visit to the country. It proposed that Chinese firms would pick up these projects, finance its completely and also bring their own contractors for construction.
“It is practically impossible for the government to agree with such a proposal from China. Award of road projects in the country follow a process and everyone has to adhere to it,” said M Murali, director general, National Highway Builders Federation.
The government official quoted earlier said that the proposal presented by China was non-transparent model that will make it difficult to judge the total project cost of a highway stretch. “We want the Chinese to participate in bids like other developers and take the projects. Both EPC and Built Own and Transfer (BoT) models are based on competitive bidding,” the official added.
 
The nine projects identified by China for possible investments by its companies span across the country in states such as Punjab, Haryana, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh. These projects are yet to be bid and each stretch is worth Rs 1,000 crore.
The road ministry proposes to award 8,500 kms of stretch this fiscal. The nine projects are included under this category. Sources said that road ministry has already sent an email to the infrastructure department of China detailing the processes followed in the country. It has also sought financial structure of proposed investment being explored by China in the sector and also advised to route investment in BoT projects.

Renault Duster AWD to be launched on Sep 24Express News Service | Posted: September 22, 2014 4:40 pm
It’s official! Renault will be driving in the 4-wheel drive version of its popular SUV, Duster, in India on September 24, 2014. Dubbed the Duster AWD, this all new model is one of the most eagerly anticipated vehicles for our market, especially among those who have a penchant for off-roading. Thus far, the Duster was only offered in a front-wheel drive layout, which in a way limited its customer base to only urban commuters. With the launch of an all-wheel drive variant, the Duster is likely to woo consumers who like exploring unprecedented territories.
Visually, there are not any major updates to report about the new Duster AWD. It looks almost identical to the 2WD sibling, but to help onlookers distinguish it from regular models, it sports smoked headlamps (as seen of the Duster Adventure edition as well), gun metal finished alloy wheels and ‘AWD’ stickers plastered on the exteriors.
On the inside, Renault has carried out some noticeable changes with the Duster AWD. This includes a new three-pod instrument cluster, bright red and grey upholstery, a sportier steering wheel and a new centre console design. The centre-strip that runs along the dashboard now comes in shade of grey as opposed to the beige finish seen on regular models.
Powertrain remains unchanged for the AWD variant as The Duster AWD sources it’s power from the same 1.5 litre four-cylinder diesel engine that develops 110PS of power and 248Nm of peak torque. Power will be transferred via means of a 6-speed manual transmission. The Duster AWD will also come with three selectable driving modes- 2WD, Auto and 4WD Lock.
Equipment wise, the new Duster AWD comes with a slew of features and is decently equipped as compared to standard model of the car. It now features traction control, cruise control, a speed limiter, gear shift indicator, ambient temperature gauge, real-time fuel efficiency display and satellite navigation as standard in the range topping RxZ model. Safety equipment and driver aids are aplenty as well, and it includes ABS, EBD, Brake Assist and dual front airbags.
The pricing for the Renault Duster AWD will be officially out on the launch day itself, but we expect it to cost about a lakh more than the regular RxL and RxZ variants of the car.
 

3 Indian-origin leaders elected to New Zeala...Indian-origin
(The National party, led…)
MELBOURNE: Three Indian-origin politicians , including a woman, have been elected to New Zealand's Parliament in the just-concluded general elections.
Kanwaljeet Singh Bakshi, Dr Parmjeet Parmar and Mahesh Bindra have successfully made it to the 121-member Parliament, the New Zealand Herald reported today.
Delhi-born Bakshi and Pune graduated Parmar fought the elections as the candidates of the ruling National party while Mumbai-born Bindra was elected as the New Zealand First party candidate.
While Bakshi is all set to begin his third term in the Parliament, Parmar and Bindra are ready to make their debut, taking the growing contribution of the Kiwi Indians in New Zealand to the parliament as well.
Bakshi is both, New Zealand's first Indian and first Sikh Member of Parliament. He was first elected in the 2008 elections.
Ranked 48th on National's party list, Parmar will make her way to the parliament as a list MP.
Bindra contested Mount Roskill, and also prepares for parliament as a list MP after being ranked 11th on the New Zealand First party list.
The National party, led by Prime Minister John Key, won 61 seats as compared to 59 in last elections, claiming 48.06 per cent of the total votes cast from 47.31 per cent in 2011.
Following the election results, Bindra says he is the living proof that his party New Zealand First and its leader Winston Peters are not anti-immigration and anti-Asian.
"Mr Peters was perceived by the Indian community for some time as being a politician who doesn't want immigrants. That was a myth and that myth has now been dispelled," Bindra was quoted by the paper as saying.
A political science and psychology graduate, Bindra moved to New Zealand in 2002 with his family.
Bakshi graduated from the University of Delhi in 1985 and moved to New Zealand in 2001 with his family.
Parmar, who lives in Auckland, was born in India and migrated to New Zealand in 1995. She holds a PhD in Biological Sciences from the University of Auckland and Bachelor and Masters degrees in Biochemistry from the University of Pune in India.

Syndicate Bank CMD sent to police custody till September 23 by court

(yndicate Bank's suspended…)
NEW DELHI: Syndicate Bank's suspended CMD S K Jain and a co-accused in a bribery case were today remanded in CBI custody till tomorrow by a special court after the agency said they were required to be confronted with alleged middleman Purushottam Totlani .
Special CBI Judge Swarana Kanta Sharma sent Jain and Vineet Godha to CBI custody after they were produced in court in pursuance to the production warrants issued against them on September 20.
During the hearing, the CBI sought custodial interrogation of both the accused saying they were to be confronted with Totlani, who is already in their custody after surrendering before the court on September 17.
According to the probe agency, the alleged bribe amount in the case was sent to Godha through Totlani who was in touch with him and also knew Jain.
Totlani had surrendered on September 17 and was sent to police custody till September 20 which was later extended to September 23.
Totlani had earlier filed an anticipatory bail plea in the court which was dismissed on the ground that his custodial interrogation was required to unearth the entire conspiracy and to know about the trail of the alleged bribe.
CBI had earlier argued there was enough evidence to connect Totlani with the case and the intercepted conversation shows his role in the conspiracy.
S K Jain, CMD of Prakash Industries Limited Ved Prakash Agarwal, Bhushan Steel Ltd Vice Chairman and Managing Director Neeraj Singal, middle-man Vineet Godha and other accused were arrested by CBI in connection with the case.
Singal was arrested by CBI on August 7, hours after the court had issued a non-bailable warrant against him and Totlani. Except Totlani, the arrested accused are currently in judicial custody.
They were apprehended in connection with two separate graft cases in which CBI had booked them under the Prevention of Corruption Act and for the charge of criminal conspiracy under the IPC.
On August 2, CBI had arrested some of the accused in connection with the case and claimed to have recovered Rs 21 lakh in cash from Jain's residence besides gold worth Rs 1.68 crore and documents of fixed deposits of up to Rs 63 lakh.
The agency has filed two cases against Jain, accusing him of receiving a bribe of Rs 50 lakh through conduits and abusing his official position to enhance the credit limits of some companies in violation of laid-down procedures.

Tesco cuts profit outlook; suspends 4 post accounting error
Tesco said the error - caused by an early booking of revenue and delayed recognition of costs - had been discovered during preparation for its forthcoming interim results.
Post your opinion here
 
Tesco cut its profit forecast for the third time this year on Monday after finding a fault in its accounts, the latest blow of several to the reputation of Britain's biggest grocer.
Shares in the company dropped 12 percent in early trade after it cut its first-half profit outlook by 250 million pounds (USD 408.50 million) and said its previous profit warning of Aug. 29 had overstated expected first half profit by 23 percent.
Tesco said the error - caused by an early booking of revenue and delayed recognition of costs - had been discovered during preparation for its forthcoming interim results.
Their publication has now been pushed back from Oct.1 to Oct 23 by the firm's new chief executive Dave Lewis, who said on Monday that an "informed employee" had notified him of the accounting issue on Friday.
Tesco said four of its employees had been placed on leave while investigations continue, and the BBC and Sky News reported that Chris Bush, the managing director of Tesco's UK business, was one of the four.
Tesco declined to comment on this but said Robin Terrell, the firm's multi-channel director, had stepped in to run the UK business.
"We have uncovered a serious issue and have responded accordingly. The chairman and I have acted quickly to establish a comprehensive independent investigation," Lewis said.
"The board, my colleagues, our customers and I expect Tesco to operate with integrity and transparency and we will take decisive action as the results of the investigation become clear."
Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said he was "flabbergasted" by the latest development and was reviewing his current recommendation to hold the company's shares.
Tesco said it was working to establish the extent of the issues and the impact they might have on its full-year profit.
It has appointed a new tax adviser Deloitte to undertake an independent and comprehensive review of the issues, working closely with Freshfields, its external legal advisers. Tesco's current auditor PwC, which has worked for it since 1983, declined to comment.
The grocer said last month it expected trading profit for the six months ending Aug. 23 to be in the region of 1.1 billion pounds.
Under its previous chief executive Phil Clarke, Tesco issued three profit warnings in two and a half years as it lost UK market share to fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as upmarket rivals Waitrose and Marks & Spencer .
"FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS"
Tesco explained in a statement on Monday that it had got its numbers wrong by overstating income and understating costs.
"Tesco has identified an overstatement of its expected profit for the half year, principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs," it announced, adding some of the impact included "in-year timing differences".
Accrual accounting requires that a company record its payments as soon as it places an order with its suppliers rather than when it subsequently pays for it.
"Such an announcement is not the stuff of a well operated FTSE-100 organisation," said Shore Capital's Black.
"This development may raise, indeed must raise, much more fundamental questions over the chairman's (Richard Broadbent) position and the nature, composition and extent of the board."
Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said the bringing in of Freshfields "implies there is potential foul play, beyond simple account stretching."
Lewis, who succeeded the ousted Phil Clarke on Sept. 1, is currently the firm's only executive director.
Alan Stewart was named as Tesco's new chief financial officer on July 10 but does not start until Dec. 1.
With a market valuation of 18.8 billion pounds and over 500,000 employees, Tesco had been the darling of the sector during two decades of uninterrupted earnings growth. Since the profit warnings and loss of market shares its share price had fallen to decade-lows.
By 0834 GMT on Monday the stock was down 8.5 percent to 209.8 pence.
(1 US dollar = 0.6120 British pound)

International accreditation of business mgmt courses by Indian B-schoolsAbhishek Agrawal      Follow @twit2abhi    Last Updated: September 17, 2014  | 11:16 IST
Abhishek Agrawal
As Indian B-schools aspire to become truly global in various aspects - student intake, quality of education, placements and participation in international rankings - more and more of them are looking for international accreditation.
Accreditation is a process of validation in which colleges, universities and other institutions of higher learning are evaluated. The standards for accreditation are set by a peer review board whose members include faculty from various accredited colleges and universities. As per business dictionary, accreditation is defined as "certification of competence in a specified subject or areas of expertise, and of the integrity, awarded by a duly recognised and respected accrediting organisation".
Merely an approval by AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) or affiliation to a university/AIU (Association of Indian Universities) no longer establishes the quality of a business management program. Even an accreditation by NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) no longer enhances reputation of these programs.
Among the 15,000-plus B-schools in the world, roughly 4,000 are in India. However, less than 0.25 per cent of Indian B-schools have received any of prestigious international accreditation.
While international accreditations are a costly affair, both in terms of financial investment and resource mobilisation in addition to tedious and time-taking process; they certainly offer a whole lot of tangible and intangible benefits - both in short and long terms. These internationally accredited institutions become more attractive to global students, faculty and recruiters alike and stand with higher ability to create a price differentiation (fees and admission brochure). On the other hand, it also helps in creating diversity of students as well as faculty. Such international accreditation gives an advantage of international recognition, status and exposure.
As these accreditations are based on assessment and verification of several parameters, including rigour in admission process, learning expectations and assurance, faculty quality, course curriculum, infrastructure, international interface, ethics, diversity, innovation, placements, among others, it serves the B-schools by informing them of their strengths and weaknesses vis-a-vis their global peers.
There are three truly international accrediting organisations:
- The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)
- The Association of MBAs (AMBA)
- The European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS)
 
While each of these use different systems on which to base their assessment of schools, all are highly evolved and provide high benchmarks for acceptance.
AACSB
The US-based Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) was established in 1916 as a membership organisation for business schools.
In 1919, the first AACSB Accreditation Standards were adopted with the primary objective of improving collegiate business education. Today, the AACSB Accreditation Standards are used as the basis to evaluate a business school's mission, operations, faculty qualifications and contributions, programs, and other critical areas. AACSB accreditation ensures students and parents that the business school is providing top-quality education. It also ensures employers that AACSB-accredited business school graduates are ready to perform from day one. Additionally, AACSB accreditation provides many benefits to the faculty and staff at its accredited schools by attracting higher quality students, providing greater research opportunities, and allowing for global recognition.
AACSB's accreditation standards drive impact, innovation and engagement with students, employers, and various stakeholders. The standards are rigorous, relevant, and benchmarks of quality. Institutions that hold AACSB accreditation are committed to high quality and continuous improvement - a powerful differentiator worldwide.
Currently, the following Indian business schools are accredited by AACSB:
a.    Indian Institute of Management Calcutta
b.    Indian School of Business, Hyderabad
c.    T A Pai Management Institute Manipal
Here is a word of caution, especially for aspiring students - there are several B-schools who are members of AACSB, but have not received accreditation.
AMBA
The Association of MBAs (AMBA) is one of the major accreditation bodies for postgraduate business education and was established in 1967. The London-based group positions itself as "the world's impartial authority on postgraduate management education".
The AMBA system judges the quality of a business school's strategy, mission, faculty, students, curriculum, and assessment. For example, to be accepted as an AMBA-accredited school, students admitted to a school's program must have at least three years of work experience and three quarters of a business school's faculty must have a Masters or Doctoral degree in a relevant discipline.
It differs from AACSB and EQUIS as it accredits a school's portfolio of postgraduate business programs rather than the entire business school.
To date AMBA has accredited programmes at 210 business schools in over 70 countries. Its process of accrediting an MBA program includes reviewing compliance with over 100 criteria, most of them qualitative rather than quantitative. The criteria fall into seven dimensions: history and development of the institution; facilities and libraries; teaching faculty, teaching standards and research track record; program administration, career and alumni services; student admission standards, diversity and cohort size; curriculum content, program mode and duration; and learning outcomes.
Some of the key AMBA criteria for the accreditation of an MBA program include:
- All admitted students should have at least three years of full-time post-graduation work experience upon the start of the MBA course
- A school should have a track record of at least three years of graduating MBA students before it can be accredited
- An MBA program should have a cohort size of at least 20 students.
- At least 50% of the faculty of an MBA program (including visiting faculty as part of the total) are normally expected to have PhD degrees
- A full-time MBA curriculum should contain no less than 500 contact (teaching) hours and a distance-learning MBA program should have no less than 120 contact hours
The following business schools in India are AMBA-accredited:
a.    Indian Institute of Management Calcutta
b.    Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode
c.    Indian Institute of Management Lucknow
d.    International Management Institute, Delhi
e.    Management Development Institute, Gurgaon
f.    S.P. Jain Institute of Management & Research Mumbai
g.    Great Lakes Institute of Management Chennai
EQUIS
EQUIS (managed by the Brussels-based European Foundation for Management Development - EFMD) is one of the major international systems of quality assessment, improvement and accreditation for business schools that provide courses in management and business administration. EQUIS evaluates a business school's governance, strategy, programs, students, faculty, research and development, executive education, contribution to the community, resources and administration, internationalisation, and corporate connections.
The fundamental objective of EQUIS is to raise the standard of management education worldwide.
How does EQUIS assess schools?
EQUIS assesses institutions as a whole. It assesses not just degree programmes but all the activities and sub-units of the institution, including research, e-learning units, executive education provision and community outreach. Institutions must be primarily devoted to management education.
EQUIS looks for a balance between high academic quality and the professional relevance provided by close interaction with the corporate world. A strong interface with the world of business is, therefore, as much a requirement as a strong research potential. EQUIS attaches particular importance to the creation of an effective learning environment that favours the development of students's managerial and entrepreneurial skills, and fosters their sense of global responsibility. It also looks for innovation in all respects, including programme design and pedagogy.
Institutions that are accredited by EQUIS must demonstrate not only high general quality in all dimensions of their activities, but also a high degree of internationalisation. With companies recruiting worldwide, with students choosing to get their education outside their home countries, and with schools building alliances across borders and continents, there is a rapidly growing need for them to be able to identify those institutions in other countries that deliver high quality education in international management.
As of now, only two business schools in India are accredited by EQUIS:
a.    Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad
b.    Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore
SAQS
In addition to these truly international accreditation, The Association of Management Development Institutions in South Asia (AMDISA), based out of India (Hyderabad) provides SAQS (South Asian Quality Assurance System) accreditation, which involves mentoring, self-assessment documentation, peer review and apex committee evaluation.
In India, the following business schools have received SAQS accreditation:
- Asian School of Business Management, Bhubaneswar
- ICFAI Business School Hyderabad Campus
- IILM Institute for Higher Education, New Delhi
- International Management Institute, New Delhi
- Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad
- Institute of Public Enterprise, Hyderabad
- K.J. Somaiya Institute of Management Studies and Research, Mumbai
- Management Development Institute, Gurgaon
- SVKM'S NMIMS School of Business Management, Mumbai
- Prin. L.N. Welingkar Institute of Management Development & Research, Mumbai
- Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB)
- XLRI School of Business and Human Resources, Jamshedpur
ACBSP
In 1989, several B-schools found that the AACSB-accredited business schools had an emphasis on research, while most business schools had emphasis on teaching. Based on the analysis of this gap, ACBSP (Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs) was established to accredit business schools with emphasis on teaching and learning. Currently ACBSP accredits nearly 8,000 programs at over 1,200 campuses across the world. However, ACBSP accreditation is widely seen as less stringent that of other accreditation bodies such as AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA.
Currently, some programs of the following B-schools in India are accredited by ACBSP:
- Amity University, Noida
- Apeejay School of Management, New Delhi
- ICBM - School of Business Excellence, Hyderabad (Doctorate degree only)
- Jansons School of Business, Coimbatore
- Lovely Professional University, Punjab
- PSG Institute of Management, Coimbatore
- Ramaiah Institute of Management Studies, Bangalore
- Regional College of Management Autonomous, Bhubaneswar
- School of Communication and Management Studies, Cochin (Doctorate degree only)
Importantly, only doctorate degrees in some of these institutions have received ACBSP recognition.
The validity of such accreditation is also important as the accreditation can be withdrawn if the required criteria are not maintained by the institute. Considering the accreditation process, quality standards, eligibility process, accreditation criteria and scope of accreditation, the true gem in an institutions crown is an accreditation by EQUIS, AMBA or AACSB. This also explains why BT-MDRA ranking methodology gives significant weightage to these three international accreditations in its annual ranking of B-schools.

The  big and rising area  of virtual-reality technology0
A. Suppose you’re sitting in traffic, and in the next lane there is a truck that starts moving. Do you ever have that (sensation) where you feel like you’re moving backwards? It feels uncomfortable because the sensors inside of your inner ear are not registering any acceleration at all, but your eyes are convinced that you’re accelerating. In virtual reality, it’s the same kind of sensory mismatch, and it causes discomfort for many people. How should you design virtual reality experiences so you feel like you’re moving around naturally but you’re not causing discomfort?
Q. Where do you see the demand for virtual reality beyond gaming and entertainment?
A. Take people with limited mobility. This is what made me very passionate since the very beginning. My grandmother and her sister were separated after World War II. They saw each other twice in 60 years. The best they could do was by phone. I thought wouldn’t it be great for them to be together for family experiences, birthday parties and holidays?
There are so many possibilities for people with limited mobility, either due to being elderly or physical disabilities, or they want to experience something very strenuous like scuba diving to get an idea what that experience would be. I would like to see it for both relaxation and entertainment in personal experiences to be transported to your own personal space. It’s also going to be an amazing platform for social interaction. You can bring different cultures together by virtually transporting people, just like the Internet is already doing, but you may be able to bring a higher level of feeling present together.
Q. What have you learned from Silicon Valley about enabling innovation?
A. Once there is a culture of very bright, very innovative people together, it will attract more people to do that. There’s definitely a critical mass of bright, innovative people and investors who find that very appealing.
Q&As are edited for length and clarity.

Entrepreneurial Woman s Conference: How to approach the big sale0
The panelists emphasized the importance of planning, saving and getting strong professional and legal advice when it comes to buying or selling a business. They also emphasized the importance of promptly putting a good team in place — and of understanding what you’re getting into.
Caldero said sellers of businesses should question what they are trying to accomplish and consider the effects of no more involvement in the business.
"Ask what are your objectives post-sale of the company,” Caldero said. “What do you need to have to live your life comfortably? Second, think about what your role would be post-transaction. The vast majority of people are highly affiliated with their companies, and it's difficult to figure out. If you're not prepared for the psychology of it, you could be making a deal and then, all of a sudden, you (could) start demanding things that just make no sense."
She said irrational behavior can diminish the value of the business and destroy a deal.
Dinkar-Patel, the moderator, said business owners should make sure their long-time advisors can handle such transactions. "Sometimes your advisors and CPAs and attorneys have a threshold of expertise as well," she said.
Panelists also discussed transitions in established businesses.
Maldonado, who said she became La Criolla’s CEO after her husband died, said she wished she would have borrowed money sooner and suggested that business owners borrow before they think they need the additional funds. "I am from a generation who doesn't borrow," she said. "I think the business would have been in a different place today. Borrow while you can, because it takes money to grow."
Maldonado said she had left nursing to work in the company her husband founded. She said she returned to school and took accounting classes, “which made me more confident.”
“Prepare yourself,” she said. “And what you don't know, you acquire."
Dinkar-Patel of BMO Harris Bank said business owners in their 40s and 50s need to consider succession planning because lenders want to know who will run the company later.
"It takes almost a decade to grow to take over a company," she said.

One Of The Worst Security Breaches In HistoryHome Depot Admits 56 Million Payment Cards At Risk After Cyber Attack
Posted:
reddit
The Home Depot said Thursday that about 56 million customer debit and credit cards were put at risk after hackers broke into the company's payment systems.
In a statement , the home improvement retailer said the malicious software used in the attack had been removed from its computer system in the United States and Canada and that the company had enhanced encryption at point-of-sale terminals at its U.S. stores.
The number of cardholders affected in the Home Depot attack marks what is likely the largest breach ever of a retailer's computer system, surpassing the 40 million cardholders who were affected when Target was hacked last fall.
Home Depot's investigation found the hackers escaped detection by using custom-made malware that had never been seen before. Such malware -- which hackers call "zero days" because that's how long it's been known -- can't be spotted by traditional anti-virus software.
Home Depot said the malware that stole the credit card data resided on its computer systems from April until September of this year -- far longer than the attack against Target, which went on for about three weeks.
Home Depot said there was no evidence that debit card PIN numbers were compromised or that the breach impacted stores in Mexico or customers who shopped online.
The retailer is offering free credit monitoring to customers who used a payment card at a Home Depot store since April. Home Depot has 1,977 stores in the United States and 180 in Canada.
“We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and anxiety this has caused, and want to reassure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges,” Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said in a statement. “From the time this investigation began, our guiding principle has been to put our customers first, and we will continue to do so.”
The company said it has finished installing security software that scrambles credit card data to make it unreadable to hackers. The rollout of the software began in January, but it wasn't completed in Home Depot's U.S. stores until last Saturday.
The company also said it will finish setting up more secure credit card readers in all of its U.S. stores by the end of the year. The new technology will be able to read a new type of credit card that uses a combination of an embedded microchip and a code to authorize transactions. "Chip and pin" technology, as it is known, is supposed to make it much more difficult for thieves to use stolen credit card data to make counterfeit cards. All merchants and banks are under an October 2015 deadline to upgrade to the more secure credit cards.
The Home Depot breach is just the latest in a string of cyber attacks against major retailers this year. Target, Sally Beauty, Neiman Marcus and Michaels have all also been hacked.
That list is expected to grow even longer. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security warned that more than 1,000 U.S. retailers may have been infected with malware lurking in their payment systems.
While Home Depot confirmed the size of the breach Thursday, many questions remain unanswered, including how the hackers found their way into the retailer's computer system -- and who they are.
Investigators believe the thieves may be from Eastern Europe because the malware they used in the attack had links to websites referencing the United States' role in the conflict in Ukraine, according to The New York Times.
While the breach affected 56 million cards, it could have been even worse. The hackers installed malware mostly on payment systems in Home Depot's self-checkout lanes, suggesting they likely stole fewer cards than they could have if they had targeted regular checkout lanes, according to cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs , who cited sources close to the investigation.

The details: A Christian group received permission to distribute Bibles and other religious materials to their students, leading atheist groups to appeal for an equal opportunity . It wasn't long before the Satanic community hopped on board as well.
" If a public school board is going to allow religious pamphlets and full Bibles to be distributed to students -- as is the case in Orange County, Florida -- we think the responsible thing to do is to ensure that these students are given access to a variety of differing religious opinions, as opposed to standing idly by while one religious voice dominates the discourse and delivers propaganda to youth," the Satanic Temple’s spokesperson, Lucien Greaves, explained in a statement.
"I am quite certain that all of the children in these Florida schools are already aware of the Christian religion and it’s Bible, and this might be the first exposure these children have to the actual practice of Satanism. We think many students will be very curious to see what we offer."
Intrigued? You can purchase the book for $9.95 here. For a very different, yet equally unconventional, take on a coloring book, check out Ryan Hunter and Taige Jensen' hilarious " Coloring Book for Grownups. "
Correction: An earlier edition of this article misstated that a Christian group received permission to distribute Bibles last month, when this in fact occurred last year. We regret the error.

PHOTOS: UK Media Breathes A Huge Sigh Of Relief Over Scotland Votereddit
The overwhelming majority of the British media celebrated on Friday morning when the Scottish people voted to remain part of the United Kingdom . The sense of relief was palpable across the nation's front pages. The Union Jack was very, very prominent.
Below, a sampling.

Understanding the federal court ruling that allows an FLDS church leader not to testifyBy Will Baude September 21
Lots of folks on the internet have been talking about the recent district judge decision in Perez v. Paragon Contractors, which held that RFRA protected a member of the FLDS church (Vernon Steed) from being compelled to testify in a federal child labor investigation.
The reaction has been pretty negative. Here is Ian Milheiser ; here is Josh Blackman ; others are quoted here .
But I thought it would be helpful to break apart the ruling briefly and see what, if anything, is so wrong with it.
1, Is there a substantial burden?
This is the threshhold question for a RFRA claim, and the district court’s decision here seems quite right:
Mr. Steed states that he has made religious vows “not to discuss matters related to the internal affairs or organization of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints”, Steed Aff. at 1, and if required to give such testimony he would be “directly violating [his] sincerely held religious beliefs”. Id. at 2. … He has so stated under oath. There is no evidence of record that he does not sincerely hold his expressed religious beliefs.
That seems plainly enough to satisfy the substantial-burden test and I haven’t yet seen any good reason to believe that the judge was wrong in thinking him insincere.
2, Does the government have a compelling interest here?
The court assumes this factor to be satisfied, but it does so in such a cursory fashion that it makes the next question a little hard to analyze.
3, If so, is requiring Steed’s testimony the least restrictive way of serving that compelling interest?
The court’s opinion here is quite conclusory:
As noted, under RFRA the government may not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion unless it can demonstrate that the burden in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest, and it is the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling interest. Here, the matter quickly is resolved by skipping directly to the least restrictive means requirement. Petitioner has failed to show that forcing Mr. Steed to answer the questions offensive to his sincerely held religious beliefs is the least restrictive means to advance any compelling interest it may have. For example, as a less restrictive alternative, Petitioner can continue with its efforts to obtain needed information from Paragon Contractors Corporation, Brian Jessop, Dale Barlow and others who contracted to manage the pecan ranch. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at *2780 (“The least-restrictive-means standard is exceptionally demanding …” and is not satisfied where the party imposing the burden “has not shown that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the objecting part[y] …”).
Josh Blackman thinks the analysis is obviously wrong:
This seems so wrong. Testimony is personal. A witness testifies about what he or she witnessed. There is no other way to get a person’s testimony than to have that person testify! This isn’t like Hobby Lobby, where someone else can pay for the same contraceptive. Pills are fungible. Testimony is not. This should be easily reversed.
I am not so sure. The answer depends on what the government’s compelling interest actually is. Is the government’s compelling interest in each individual person’s testimony? Then Josh’s criticism is right. Or is the government’s compelling interest in finding out what happened generally? Then the court might be right, because there are other routes to find out what happened to a reasonable degree of certainty.
Because the court skips over the compelling interest analysis — and doesn’t even tell us what it is assuming the compelling interest to be — it’s hard to evaluate whether it’s right or wrong.
That drives home a more general point about RFRA analysis, which is that the precise formulation of the compelling interest often affects how the least-restrictive-means prong works. I’ve noticed that some courts and litigants seem tempted to define compelling interests in vague terms or to skip over that portion of the analysis, but often the assumption about precisely how to frame the interest is secretly dispositive later.
4, Was RFRA properly raised?
One final potential problem with the ruling that hasn’t been the focus of criticism is whether Mr. Steed actually raised a RFRA claim at all. The magistrate judge who first ruled on the case had said this:
By relying upon Yoder to make their First Amendment arguments, the parties failed to address the application of Smith. While Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in response to Smith, Burwell, 2014 WL 2921709, at *7, neither party has argued RFRA applies to this case, and Mr. Steed’s counsel has specifically acknowledged he has made a plain First Amendment Free Exercise of Religion claim.1 Therefore, Smith provides the controlling standard.
The district court disagreed, but again provided sufficiently little explanation that it is hard to tell why. Normally courts have a certain amount of discretion with respect to waiver, but in RFRA cases it can be a little unfair for a court to invoke RFRA without warning. Notice that in its analysis the court relies on the fact that the government has the burden of showing that it is using the least restrictive means (“petition has failed to demonstrate…”). But it would be unfair to invoke that burden if the government hadn’t been placed on notice of the claim in the first place.
Again, given the cursory nature of the district court’s ruling, it’s hard to tell if it was right or wrong for it to consider the claim properly raised. (Of course, the district court might not have expected its opinion to be read by the entire legal blogosphere.)
In any event, reading the opinion, I think it is too soon to say that it is wrong. It might be wrong, but that is a less obvious question than it seems.

minimum wage up to 8 an hourLabour minimum wage promise would see £8 per hour rate by 2020
Ed Miliband: Labour 'determined' to raise minimum wage
Labour views: Memory man Miliband
The minimum wage would rise to £8 an hour over the course of the next parliament if Labour wins the general election, the party has pledged.
Leader Ed Miliband said it was "not good enough" that one in five people in the UK were on low pay.
But the Conservatives said they had already delivered an above-inflation increase as, from October, the minimum wage will rise from £6.31 to £6.50.
The minimum wage for adult workers was £5.80 at the time of the last election.
Chancellor George Osborne suggested, in an interview with BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson in January, that the minimum wage would rise to £7 an hour in 2015 to return the level it was at before the economic downturn.
'Wealth creators'
The rate is recommended by the Low Pay Commission, which is overseen by Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable.
Government sources have suggested that the rate would probably rise to £8 by the end of the next Parliament if it continued on current trends. The TUC has called for the minimum wage to increase to £10 an hour.
Mr Miliband announced the policy in interviews with the Sunday Mirror and Observer newspapers as Labour's annual conference got under way in Manchester.
The party says the £1.50 per hour increase would be worth £60 a week, or £3,000 a year, for the lowest paid.
"Too often people think that politics doesn't care about them," the Labour leader told the Sunday Mirror.
"They are the wealth creators just as much as the top entrepreneurs and the top business people. And we've got to reward them."
Labour's link with the trade unions is "absolutely where it should be" says the shadow business secretary
He said the party would show "how we can become a country that rewards hard work once again".
In the Observer interview he added: "It is not good enough for us that one in five people in our country go out to work, make their contribution and are in low pay."
'Save money'
The proposed increase would affect around 1.4 million jobs. It would be introduced in annual stages by the Low Pay Commission before October 2019.
Mr Miliband's proposed rate is said to be similar to that in force in Australia and EU countries such as Belgium and Germany, but lower than in France and New Zealand.
National Minimum Wage rates
*From 1 October **Current rate
2014*
£3.64
£2.50
The Labour leader rejected claims it would cost jobs and be unaffordable for the public sector, such as local councils and hospitals, who are among the biggest employers of low-paid staff.
"It is actually going to save money in benefits," the Labour leader told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show.
"What is happening at the moment is that we are spending billions of pounds subsidising employers who are paying low wages, billions of pounds in benefits, tax credits and housing benefit.
"It is going to have no cost at all to the public sector, and it is the government's own figures that say that."
'Crashing economy'
But business lobby group the CBI said increasing the level of the minimum wage by the amount suggested by Mr Miliband would cost jobs.
CBI deputy director general Katja Hall said: "The minimum wage is set at the highest rate it can be without putting job creation at risk at the moment."
She accused Mr Miliband of trying to "politicize" the Low Pay Commission, adding: "Raising wages in this way would put serious strain on businesses, particularly hard-pressed smaller firms with tight margins, which would end up employing fewer people. Instead, politicians should address how people move on in their careers, through training and better skills, helping them move to higher paying roles over time."
Conservative Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said people would not take "lectures" from Labour on helping people on low pay.
"By crashing the economy, Labour made everyone poorer and they haven't learnt their lesson," he said.
"Ed Miliband would make people worse off with the same failed policies that got us into a mess in the first place - more wasteful spending, more borrowing and higher taxes."
'Dangerous'
The Liberal Democrats said the best way to help the low paid was to cut their taxes.
"Labour has refused to back tax cuts for working people," a spokesperson added.
The national minimum wage is the lowest hourly rate at which workers must legally be paid, although there are lower levels for workers aged 18-20, those under 18 and those working on an apprentice scheme.
It was introduced by Labour in 1997 and the level is reassessed annually by the Low Pay Commission, which then makes a recommendation to ministers.
October's above-inflation increase of 19 pence (3%) - announced in March - will be the first time in six years that the rise is higher than inflation.
The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour, a 2% increase.
The rate for those aged 16 and 17 will rise by 7p to £3.79, also a 2% rise.
Apprentices will earn an extra 5p an hour, taking their wages to at least £2.73.
In August the Consumer Price Index rate of inflation was 1.5%.

will reinstate the 50 top rate of taxEd Balls sets out priorities for 'first Labour Budget'
 
The shadow chancellor said Labour would "balance the books in a fairer way" as he set out plans to reduce the deficit
Labour views: Memory man Miliband
Ed Balls has said he will increase the minimum wage and the top rate of income tax and extend child benefit curbs in his first Budget if Labour wins power.
The shadow chancellor told Labour's conference the party had "more work to do" to persuade people it can deliver the change he said people wanted.
He said he would act swiftly after the election to reverse housing benefit cuts and boost jobs for young people.
And he hinted that Labour would be prepared to accept Heathrow expansion.
In his last conference address before next year's election, Mr Balls said Labour had learnt from its "past mistakes" and would not "flinch" from tough decisions if it regained power.
Anticipating his first Budget, which he would be expected to deliver in the summer of 2015 if Labour was elected, Mr Balls said his priorities would be:
A rise in minimum wage
A cut in business rates
A mansion tax on properties worth over £2m
A 20-month freeze in energy bills
A Jobs guarantee for young people
A 50p top rate of income tax
Scrapping the "bedroom tax"
Extending the 1% cap on child benefit rises to 2017
Mr Balls said Labour was serious about "balancing the books" in the next Parliament and would not "make any promises it cannot keep or afford".
"The country is crying out for change," he said. "But we have more work to do to show Labour can deliver the change that people want to see.
Analysis by economics editor Robert Peston
Ed Balls has a difficult trick to pull off at Labour's conference in Manchester.
He wants to be seen to be austere and fiscally righteous - so that investors in Britain do not become anxious that Britain's high public sector deficit, which is currently running at around 6% of national income, would persist for many years yet.
To put Britain's deficit into perspective, that gap between revenues and spending is about 50% higher than France's - which has a lower credit rating than the UK's and is widely seen to be in a much bigger economic mess than this country.
But he cannot be seen to be as austere as Chancellor George Osborne because then there would be little reason to vote Labour.
Read Robert's full blog here.
"To show that we have learned from our time in government, that we will make the tough decisions we need to get the deficit down and that we can change our economy and make it work for working people."
As part of what he said was a "fully costed" programme, he announced that the value of child benefits would continue to fall in real terms for the first two years of a Labour government.
Under his plans, child benefit payments would not rise in line with inflation but by a fixed rate of 1% per year until 2017. The policy is already in place until 2016, having been announced by the coalition, but Labour's move would see it continue for another year.
Millions of households which receive the benefit would be affected by the move.
a week for first child
£13.55
a week for every other child
Reduced benefit - Payment is reduced if either parent earns over £50,000 per year
£60,000 cut-off - Benefit is stopped if either parent earns £60,000 or more
Labour has repeatedly criticised the coalition's benefit cuts, including Chancellor George Osborne's decision to remove child benefit for higher earning households, which Mr Balls said in 2013 created "huge unfairness".
But Mr Balls said Labour was set to inherit an annual budget deficit of £75bn if it regains power and as a result will not be able to reverse most of the cuts and will have to introduce some of its own.
He said: "We will have to make other decisions which I know will not be popular with everyone.
"I want to see child benefit rising again in line with inflation in the next parliament, but we will not spend money we cannot afford.
"So for the first two years of the next parliament, we will cap the rise in child benefit at 1%. It will save £400m in the next Parliament. And all the savings will go towards reducing the deficit."
Ed Miliband congratulates Ed Balls after the speech
Mr Balls said Labour's deficit-cutting approach, which aims to eliminate the current budget surplus by 2020, would be "fairer" than the Conservatives because they would reinstate the 50% top rate of income tax.
He also announced plans for a 5% pay cut for government ministers with their pay to be frozen until the deficit has been cleared.
And he suggested that a future Labour government would "resolve" the issue of new airport capacity in the south of England and not "kick the issue into the long grass".
He said a decision must be taken whatever the outcome of the Davies commission into future options - which is looking at expanding either Heathrow and Gatwick.
A Treasury source said the child benefit move would only yield £120m, suggesting Labour's figures were based on historical rather than current rates of inflation.
Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said Labour voted against the original child benefit cap but now were saying that "it did not go far enough".
Analysis by personal finance reporter Kevin Peachey
Much of the focus at the start of 2013 - when big changes were made to child benefit - was on those high-income parents no longer entitled to the money.
But arguably more significant was the fact that lower-earning mums and dads were taking a hit in real terms too.
The benefit was frozen for three years from 2010 and is not rising in line with the cost of living for another two.
Remember, it is not the only benefit witnessing a 1% cap. Others include maternity pay and jobseeker's allowance.
Labour's proposals would tighten the financial squeeze on parents. But only when we see all parties' tax and benefit proposals in full will it be clear who is exerting the greatest pressure on our wallets and purses.
And child poverty campaigners said it would leave the typical family £400 a year worse off by 2017.
"We urge the shadow chancellor to reconsider so that children and their already struggling families do not suffer even more unnecessary hardship," said Children's Society boss Matthew Reed.
The CBI business group said Mr Balls had set out "some of the foundations" for long-term growth but expressed concerns about attempts to "politicise" decisions about the minimum wage.
"Attempting to fix future levels now is finger-in-the-air economics which takes no account of the economic realities at that time, nor the ability of firms to pay," said its director general John Cridland.
Unite general secretary Len McCluskey praised the bulk of Mr Balls' speech but said the child benefit freeze was a "throwaway line designed to demonstrate some kind of toughness".
And UKIP said Labour was "promising the earth without doing the sums".
Mr Balls was in a cuts controversy of a different kind on Sunday, when he accidentally elbowed a journalist in the eye during a charity football match. He has defended the coming together as an accident and said there was no malice intended.
 

looking into buy a few of those Phones 4 U shopsPhones 4U shops closing for business
Mobile phone operator EE is in talks to take over stores from Phones 4U, which fell into administration last week.
EE would not confirm any details but it is thought the deal could involve up to 60 stores.
On Friday Vodafone agreed to take over 140 outlets.
Phones 4U collapsed when it failed to reach deals with EE and Vodafone to sell their services and those two firms last week had to deny claims they were behind Phones 4U's collapse.
As an independent retailer, Phones 4U relied on deals with EE and Vodafone to sell their services but both pulled out of negotiations to agree fresh contracts.
Phones 4U founder John Caudwell blamed the demise of the company on the "ruthless actions" of "predatory" mobile phone networks.
Mr Caudwell, who sold Phones 4U in 2006, told the BBC's Today programme last week that it was an "unprecedented assassination".
The mobile firms rejected his claim.
EE said its decision to end its relationship with Phones 4U was based on its strategy to focus on its own shops and cut out intermediaries, while Vodafone rejected an suggestion that it had acted inappropriately during contract negotiations.
Job losses
Mr Caudwell also criticised the private equity firm BC that owned Phones 4U for loading the retailer with more than £200m in debt.
Thousands of jobs remain at risk at Phones 4U, which had had more than 700 outlets and almost 5,600 staff.
Administrators PwC confirmed last week that 628 employees at Phones 4U head office in Newcastle-under-Lyme are losing their jobs.
EE said that it hoped to make an announcement about its deal with Phones 4U soon.

fate of Air France is at stakeMinister says the fate of Air France is 'at stake'
Air France pilots are protesting over the carrier's expansion of its low-cost business
Monarch airlines may cut 1,000 jobs
The fate of Air France is "at stake" in a dispute between the airline and its pilots, according to France's Transport Minister.
Pilots are protesting over the firm's plan to develop its budget carrier, Transavia, where pilots are paid less.
Speaking on French radio, Alain Vidalies said the company must expand its low cost business. "I think pilots are fully aware of this," he said.
The pilots' strike will enter its second week on Monday.
It is due to run until Friday, but the SNPL pilots' union has warned it could be extended further if talks fail.
'Obligatory move'
"There must be a positive approach in this situation, otherwise I think  that it's the fate of the company that could be at stake," Mr Vidalies told France Info radio.
"The low cost [sector] is not a choice, it's an obligatory move, that's reality. I think pilots are fully aware of this," he said.
The airline estimates the strike, which started last Monday, is costing up to 15m euros (£12m) a day.
On Monday Air France expects to operate 41% of its flights.
The union has called on the French government to intervene and help resolve the dispute.
"Talks have reached a complete impasse," the SNPL said in a statement.
"Management is playing for time, waiting for the movement to weaken."

debut on the New York Stock ExchangeAlibaba shares surge in their NY stock market debut
The New York Stock Exchange was festooned in banners of Alibaba's signature orange and white
Alibaba sets share price at $68
Alibaba's shares closed significantly above their initial price on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Friday, a sign of the excitement surrounding the Chinese internet giant.
Shares in the company made their debut in the US at $92.70 (£57), after being priced at $68 late on Thursday.
They ended the $93.89 - 38% above the initial asking price.
More than 100 million shares were traded in the minutes after the stock was launched - more than Twitter.
Earlier in the day, founder and chairman Jack Ma rang the opening bell.
The NYSE was festooned with the orange and white logos of the company to herald its arrival on public markets.
The company raised nearly $21.8bn in its share sale, indicating strong investor appetite for China's e-commerce giant.
Alibaba is now valued at $231.4bn - making it significantly larger than Amazon and Facebook.
Investors are eager to get a piece of China's e-commerce market, which is expected to grow significantly
If Alibaba's bankers decide to take up an option in which they can purchase 48 million shares themselves, then Alibaba's launch will have raised nearly $25bn - breaking the previous $22.1bn record set by China's Agricultural Bank in 2010.
A way in
Alibaba operates a series of online marketplaces in China and elsewhere, handling more transactions than Amazon and eBay combined.
Alibaba's founder and chairman Jack Ma (middle) rang the opening bell in celebration on Friday
It is responsible for more than 80% of online e-commerce in China.
Alibaba's share sale is being viewed as a way to invest in e-commerce growth in China.
Already, the country is home to the largest population of internet users on the planet - and most estimates say that only half of China's 1.3 billion residents have signed online.
That is why investors have been angling for some time to get a piece of Alibaba - long the market leader in e-commerce in China.
Alibaba's employees were at the exchange, behind a banner listing some of Alibaba's websites
However, investors are not buying shares directly in Alibaba's companies operating in China, but rather in a holding company in Cayman Islands which has a profits contract with Alibaba.
That has made some wary, and it is one reason why Alibaba did not list on Hong Kong's stock exchange.
New millionaires
Like other giant technology share sales of late, Alibaba's is expected to mint several new millionaires
Either way, the sale is expected to make millionaires out of a large number of the company's managers, software engineers and other staff.
Currently Alibaba's single largest shareholder is Japan's Softbank which holds a 32% stake.
US search giant Yahoo also has a stake.
The firm made a profit of almost $2bn in the three months to the end of June, with sales up by 46% year-on-year to $2.54bn.
Traders shouted out prices of the stock on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange
Analysis: Michelle Fleury, New York Business Correspondent
Wall Street was painted orange this Friday, the colour of Alibaba. The distinctive exterior of the New York Stock Exchange was hidden behind a giant sign for the Chinese e-commerce giant. And the branding was even more visible inside. Traders at the spot on the trading floor where Alibaba made its debut were given branded raincoats. One told me 'it's raining cash'.
As the start of trading got closer, those closest to the action shouted out prices to nearby specialists - an old-fashioned method in a high tech market. Alibaba founder Jack Ma stopped to chat and shake hands with several traders as anticipation built up ahead of the first trade.
Such is his cult status back home, there was also a crowd outside the exchange. Chinese fans waited, hoping to catch a glimpse of the man whose success has turned this internet fledgling into a company with a market capitalisation close to that of supermarket giant Walmart.
Jack Ma has approached "cult status" in China, says the BBC's Michelle Fleury

Labour views: Memory man Miliband
Ed Balls has said he will increase the minimum wage and the top rate of income tax and extend child benefit curbs in his first Budget if Labour wins power.
The shadow chancellor told Labour's conference the party had "more work to do" to persuade people it can deliver the change he said people wanted.
He said he would act swiftly after the election to reverse housing benefit cuts and boost jobs for young people.
And he hinted that Labour would be prepared to accept Heathrow expansion.
In his last conference address before next year's election, Mr Balls said Labour had learnt from its "past mistakes" and would not "flinch" from tough decisions if it regained power.
Anticipating his first Budget, which he would be expected to deliver in the summer of 2015 if Labour was elected, Mr Balls said his priorities would be:
A rise in minimum wage
A cut in business rates
A mansion tax on properties worth over £2m
A 20-month freeze in energy bills
A Jobs guarantee for young people
A 50p top rate of income tax
Scrapping the "bedroom tax"
Extending the 1% cap on child benefit rises to 2017
Mr Balls said Labour was serious about "balancing the books" in the next Parliament and would not "make any promises it cannot keep or afford".
"The country is crying out for change," he said. "But we have more work to do to show Labour can deliver the change that people want to see.
Analysis by economics editor Robert Peston
Ed Balls has a difficult trick to pull off at Labour's conference in Manchester.
He wants to be seen to be austere and fiscally righteous - so that investors in Britain do not become anxious that Britain's high public sector deficit, which is currently running at around 6% of national income, would persist for many years yet.
To put Britain's deficit into perspective, that gap between revenues and spending is about 50% higher than France's - which has a lower credit rating than the UK's and is widely seen to be in a much bigger economic mess than this country.
But he cannot be seen to be as austere as Chancellor George Osborne because then there would be little reason to vote Labour.

"To show that we have learned from our time in government, that we will make the tough decisions we need to get the deficit down and that we can change our economy and make it work for working people."
As part of what he said was a "fully costed" programme, he announced that the value of child benefits would continue to fall in real terms for the first two years of a Labour government.
Under his plans, child benefit payments would not rise in line with inflation but by a fixed rate of 1% per year until 2017. The policy is already in place until 2016, having been announced by the coalition, but Labour's move would see it continue for another year.
Millions of households which receive the benefit would be affected by the move.

£13.55
a week for every other child
Reduced benefit - Payment is reduced if either parent earns over £50,000 per year
£60,000 cut-off - Benefit is stopped if either parent earns £60,000 or more
Labour has repeatedly criticised the coalition's benefit cuts, including Chancellor George Osborne's decision to remove child benefit for higher earning households, which Mr Balls said in 2013 created "huge unfairness".
But Mr Balls said Labour was set to inherit an annual budget deficit of £75bn if it regains power and as a result will not be able to reverse most of the cuts and will have to introduce some of its own.
He said: "We will have to make other decisions which I know will not be popular with everyone.
"I want to see child benefit rising again in line with inflation in the next parliament, but we will not spend money we cannot afford.
"So for the first two years of the next parliament, we will cap the rise in child benefit at 1%. It will save £400m in the next Parliament. And all the savings will go towards reducing the deficit."
Ed Miliband congratulates Ed Balls after the speech
Mr Balls said Labour's deficit-cutting approach, which aims to eliminate the current budget surplus by 2020, would be "fairer" than the Conservatives because they would reinstate the 50% top rate of income tax.
He also announced plans for a 5% pay cut for government ministers with their pay to be frozen until the deficit has been cleared.
And he suggested that a future Labour government would "resolve" the issue of new airport capacity in the south of England and not "kick the issue into the long grass".
He said a decision must be taken whatever the outcome of the Davies commission into future options - which is looking at expanding either Heathrow and Gatwick.
A Treasury source said the child benefit move would only yield £120m, suggesting Labour's figures were based on historical rather than current rates of inflation.
Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said Labour voted against the original child benefit cap but now were saying that "it did not go far enough".
Analysis by personal finance reporter Kevin Peachey
Much of the focus at the start of 2013 - when big changes were made to child benefit - was on those high-income parents no longer entitled to the money.
But arguably more significant was the fact that lower-earning mums and dads were taking a hit in real terms too.
The benefit was frozen for three years from 2010 and is not rising in line with the cost of living for another two.
Remember, it is not the only benefit witnessing a 1% cap. Others include maternity pay and jobseeker's allowance.
Labour's proposals would tighten the financial squeeze on parents. But only when we see all parties' tax and benefit proposals in full will it be clear who is exerting the greatest pressure on our wallets and purses.
And child poverty campaigners said it would leave the typical family £400 a year worse off by 2017.
"We urge the shadow chancellor to reconsider so that children and their already struggling families do not suffer even more unnecessary hardship," said Children's Society boss Matthew Reed.
The CBI business group said Mr Balls had set out "some of the foundations" for long-term growth but expressed concerns about attempts to "politicise" decisions about the minimum wage.
"Attempting to fix future levels now is finger-in-the-air economics which takes no account of the economic realities at that time, nor the ability of firms to pay," said its director general John Cridland.
Unite general secretary Len McCluskey praised the bulk of Mr Balls' speech but said the child benefit freeze was a "throwaway line designed to demonstrate some kind of toughness".
And UKIP said Labour was "promising the earth without doing the sums".
Mr Balls was in a cuts controversy of a different kind on Sunday, when he accidentally elbowed a journalist in the eye during a charity football match. He has defended the coming together as an accident and said there was no malice intended.

During its final preparations for the forthcoming interim results, Tesco has identified an overstatement of its expected profit for the half year, principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs.
 
On the basis of preliminary investigations into the UK food business, the Board believes that the guidance issued on 29 August 2014 for the Group profits for the six months to 23 August 2014 was overstated by an estimated £250m.  Some of this impact includes in-year timing differences.  Work is ongoing to establish the extent of these issues and what impact they will have on the full year.
 
The Board has asked Deloitte to undertake an independent and comprehensive review of these issues, working closely with Freshfields, the Group's external legal advisers.
 
We will provide a further update at our interim results, which will now be announced on the 23 October 2014.
Dave Lewis, Group CEO:
"We have uncovered a serious issue and have responded accordingly.  The Chairman and I have acted quickly to establish a comprehensive independent investigation.  The Board, my colleagues, our customers and I expect Tesco to operate with integrity and transparency and we will take decisive action as the results of the investigation become clear."

Tesco suspends executives in profits probeTesco suspends execs as inquiry launched into profit overstatement
Full interview with  Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis
Tesco has suspended four executives, including its UK managing director, after the supermarket overstated its half-year profit guidance by £250m.
That would be almost a quarter of its expected profit for the period.
It has launched an investigation headed by Deloitte, and says it is now working to establish the impact of the issue on its full-year results.
"Disappointment would be an understatement," said Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis.
Mr Lewis, who only took the helm on 1 September, said it was "a serious issue", but insisted "it doesn't take away from what I'm able to build at Tesco".
The news prompted a plunge in Tesco's share price, which closed 11.6% lower at 203p.
As a result almost £2.2bn was wiped from Tesco's value on the stock market.

Mr Lewis said "a number of people" had been suspended from duty "to facilitate the fullest and deepest investigation possible", but said this was not "disciplinary or an admission of guilt".
UK managing director Chris Bush is one of those suspended, according to Radio 5 Live presenter Adam Parsons.
Mr Lewis said Robin Terrell , Tesco's multi-channel director, would be "stepping in and running and leading the UK leadership team", but he refused to confirm that Mr Bush had been suspended.
Tesco is also believed to have suspended its UK finance director Carl Rogberg, its food commercial director John Scouler and the head of food sourcing Matt Simister .
Mr Lewis said the issue was "something completely out of the ordinary" and his priority was to carry out "a full and frank investigation".
"We will take decisive action as the results of the investigation become clear," he added.
Tesco also confirmed that there had been no chief financial officer (CFO) at the group since its current CFO Laurie McIlwee left just over a week ago, following his resignation in April.
Marks and Spencer's CFO, Alan Stewart, was announced as Mr McIlwee's replacement in July, but is not due to join Tesco until December.
Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent rebuffed criticism that he should have discovered the issue sooner.
"Things are always unnoticed until they have been noticed." he said. "The shareholders will have to decide for themselves whether I'm part of the solution or part of the problem."
Analysis, Simon Jack, business correspondent:
Breaking accounting rules to exaggerate profits is a cardinal sin as far as investors are concerned and Tesco has been punished severely with shares falling more than 10% at one stage today.
The scale of the discrepancies which happened in its core UK food retail business poses serious questions on how this important UK company has been run.
Things are always unnoticed until they have been noticed”
End Quote Sir Richard Broadbent Tesco chairman
In effect this FTSE 100 company has been operating without a CFO - their replacement for Laurie McIlwee is not due to start for several weeks.
Questions must also be asked of the former boss Philip Clarke, the entire board of directors and the company's auditors.
Taken in isolation this incident would be serious, but added to falling sales, profit warnings and a share price at 10-year lows, it suggests this once formidable retailer is in a state of disarray.
The new boss, Dave Lewis, will hope the investigation he has launched will help put this latest disaster behind him as he tries to rebuild the relationship with customers and investors.
Results delayed
On 29 August , Tesco had said it expected its trading profit for the six months to 23 August to be about £1.1bn, lower than management had expected.
In its latest statement, Tesco said the profits overstatement was "principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs".
It also said some of the error - which referred to its expected profits for the six months to 23 August - was due to the timing of the accounting of payments between suppliers and Tesco.
Mr Lewis said this meant "an element of" expected revenue from its suppliers had been "reported in the wrong time period".
"It's about revenue received versus when the activity took place," he added.
Tesco said "an informed employee" had alerted the board to the issue on Friday, and added it had already informed the UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
Analyst, Robert Gregory: "Investors are really uncertain about Tesco at the moment and its future direction."
As a result of the problem, Tesco has pushed back the release of its interim results to 23 October, from 1 October.
Deloitte will carry out its investigation with Freshfields, the group's external legal advisers.
Tesco's usual auditors are PWC. The accountancy firm declined to comment.
Shares in Tesco reached an 11-year low in August after the firm cut its full-year profit forecast to £2.4bn from £2.8bn.
The supermarket group has been battling falling sales and a decline in its market share as discount chains such as Aldi and Lidl have gained in popularity.
Previous chief executive Philip Clarke stood down in July after his attempts to revive Tesco's fortunes through a £1bn turnaround plan failed.
'Flabbergasted'
Analysts widely criticised Tesco following the announcement.
Cantor Fitzgerald said it had already warned last November that it believed Tesco was "demanding/taking money from suppliers trading accounts".
"We believed Tesco had been overstating its UK commercial gross profit by £200m+ per annum, via deducting monies from suppliers' trading accounts or extending payment dates without notice," it added.
Professor Ajay Bhalla of Cass Business School said "things could not be worse for Tesco's management and shareholders".
"The incoming CEO - Mr. Lewis has a momentous task in hand. Re-building the internal culture and market reputation will be his number one priority," he said.
And Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said he was "flabbergasted" by Tesco's announcement.
"Such an announcement is not the stuff of a well operated FTSE-100 organisation. This development may raise, indeed must raise, much more fundamental questions over the chairman's (Richard Broadbent) position and the nature, composition and extent of the board."

EE to take over 58 Phones 4U storesMobile phone operator EE is to buy 58 stores from Phones 4U, which fell into administration last week.
EE said the deal, agreed with administrators PwC, would safeguard 359 jobs.
On Friday, Vodafone agreed to take over 140 of Phones 4U's outlets.
Phones 4U collapsed when it failed to reach deals with EE and Vodafone to sell their services. Last week, those two firms had to deny claims they were behind Phones 4U's demise.
As an independent retailer, Phones 4U relied on deals with EE and Vodafone to sell their services but both pulled out of negotiations to agree fresh contracts.
Phones 4U founder John Caudwell blamed the demise of the company on the "ruthless actions" of "predatory" mobile phone networks.
Mr Caudwell, who sold Phones 4U in 2006, told the BBC's Today programme last week that it was an "unprecedented assassination".
The mobile firms rejected his claim.
EE said its decision to end its relationship with Phones 4U was based on its strategy to focus on its own shops and cut out intermediaries, while Vodafone rejected an suggestion that it had acted inappropriately during contract negotiations.
Mr Caudwell also criticised the private equity firm BC that owned Phones 4U for loading the retailer with more than £200m in debt.
Thousands of jobs remain at risk at Phones 4U, which had operated more than 700 outlets and had almost 5,600 staff.
Administrators PwC confirmed last week that 628 employees at Phones 4U head office in Newcastle-under-Lyme are losing their jobs.
However, Dixons Carphone also said last week that it would hire the 800 people who work in Phones 4U concessions at its Currys and PC World stores.

State-owned Coal India (CIL) has so far entered into fuel supply pacts with 161 power units for a capacity of 73,675 MW.
"Out of 78,000 MW capacity as on date, CIL (Coal India Ltd) has signed 161 FSAs (fuel supply agreements) for a capacity of 73,675 MW," according to a Coal India document.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had earlier directed for coal supplies in respect of power projects worth 78,000 MW capacity, it said. As many as 172 FSAs are to signed in this regard.
The status of the pending 11 FSAs was reviewed in the meeting of the standing linkage committee held last month, it said.
As many as 177 LoAs (Letter of Assurances) were issued by the CIL and its subsidiaries for power projects to be commissioned during 11th and 12th Plan. The LoAs cover a capacity of about 1,08,000 mw projects, it added.
The coal ministry had earlier said that CIL is yet to enter into fuel supply pacts with some of the power units as issues like change in ownership and extension of coal supplies are still being examined by it.
Two deadlines set for the signing of FSAs by CIL with the power producers could not be adhered to. The government had set the deadline of August 31, 2013 for signing of the FSAs, which could not be met. The second deadline was set for September, last year.

The world’s foremost experts and influencers of social media from across the globe – including politicians, diplomats and authors – gathered in Mumbai for the country’s third and the city’s second edition of the Social Media Week (SMW 2014).
Being held between September 22 and 26, the theme for this year is ‘Social Media for Social Change’.
The Indian Express is the media partner for this event.
Here are the highlights:

must raise their gameDebt management firms must raise their game, says FCA
Published: 22/09/2014   Last Modified : 22/09/2014
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says debt management firms must demonstrate they provide appropriate advice, do not charge unfair fees, and have adequate processes for handling client money when assessments for consumer credit authorisation start next month.
Firms that provide services which pose a higher risk to consumers will be assessed first, including debt management firms, payday lenders and credit brokers.
Victoria Raffe, director of authorisations at the FCA, said:
"These firms are advising consumers who have often reached rock bottom, so it’s important that firms get it right. Many firms are falling well short of our expectations and they will need to raise their game if they want to continue operating."
The process for authorisation will be more rigorous than the previous Office of Fair Trading licensing regime. The emphasis is on creating a sector that works well for both firms and consumers. The FCA expects all debt management firms to meet required standards, including:
a business model where customers benefit fully from the service offered, and fees are fair and transparent
providing suitable advice that takes into account a client’s circumstances and for debt solutions to be appropriate, affordable and sustainable
advice to be provided by trained staff whose interests are in getting the best outcomes for the customer, rather than driven by incentives
appropriate systems and controls that will protect client money
notifying the FCA if they have obtained a book of customers from a firm or a legal entity undertaking debt management
telling customers about free debt services and signposting them to the Money Advice Service for more information in their first communication with the customer.
The FCA has conducted targeted firm visits and has found that many debt management firms are failing to adequately follow the consumer credit rules brought in to provide additional protection for consumers in April.
Since April:
we have issued final notices against two firms who have had their applications refused
seven firms’ bank accounts have been frozen to protect client money
two firms have entered administration
one firm is closed to all business
fourteen  firms have agreed to stop taking on new business
seven firms have been directed to appoint a “skilled person” to report on the firm’s compliance with FCA rules
a further firm has cancelled its interim permission and will no longer provide debt management services
the FCA is also investigating a number of other debt management firms and individuals.
The application periods for firms with interim permission start in October 2014.
Notes for editors
The assessment process for authorisation will help to establish a clear standard across the industry which is in the interests of both firms and consumers. Further information about the authorisation periods .
On 17 September, the FCA issued a consumer warning about Gregson and Brooke Financial Services (trading as Expert Money Solutions), One Tick (trading as Debt Savers and 1-Tick) and the Money Management Service.
On 22 May 2014, the FCA announced that Debt Help & Advice Ltd and First Step Finance Ltd had stopped trading and were in administration .
In May, the FCA released research which showed that some debt management providers were giving consumers poor advice and lacked the necessary training to advise customers on suitable plans.
On 1 April 2014, the FCA became responsible for the regulation of approximately 50,000 consumer credit firms. Further information .
The Money Advice Service provides free and impartial information that can help people get on top of their debts.
On the 1 April 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Air France halts low-cost expansionStriking Air France pilots reject offer to end dispute
Air France pilots are protesting over the carrier's expansion of its low-cost business
Air France pilots say they will pursue their strike indefinitely, rejecting the airline's offer to attempt to resolve the dispute.
Air France offered to suspend plans to expand its budget carrier Transavia.
But the pilots' SNPL union described that move as a "smokescreen" that offered no more guarantees than previous offers.
Air France's chief executive Alexandre de Juniac warned the strike could have "catastrophic consequences".
The eight-day-old strike is the airline's longest since 1998 and has been costing 15m euros (£11.8m; $19.3m) a day.
Jean-Louis Barber, head of the Air France section of the SNPL union said: "As long as management does not change its philosophy and as long as Air France management will not conduct real talks in a cooperative spirit to counter low-cost (airlines), Air France pilots will be on strike."
Mr de Juniac told Le Monde newspaper that the strike was "disastrous" for the airline.
He had hoped the delay in plans to expand the Transavia low-cost business would allow time for "a thorough dialogue".
But he added: "This arrangement must not call into question our ambition to develop Transavia, which is one of the key sources of growth for the Air France-KLM group."
'Obligatory move'
Pilots fear the expansion of Transavia will drive down their wages.
Earlier this month the company announced a plan to more the double then number of passengers carried by Transavia by 2017 and expand its operations outside France.
In hubs outside France pilots are hired under local employment terms, which can be less generous than at core Air France operations.
On Sunday, France's Transport Minister Alain Vidalies said the fate of Air France was "at stake" in the dispute.
"There must be a positive approach in this situation, otherwise I think that it's the fate of the company that could be at stake," Mr Vidalies told France Info radio.
"The low-cost [sector] is not a choice, it's an obligatory move, that's reality. I think pilots are fully aware of this," he said.
Air France said it expected to operate 41% of its flights on Monday.

PSU Banks Need $37 Billion in Fresh Capital to Meet Basel III Norms: Moody sManufacturing Growth May Moderate in December Quarter: Industry Body
Mumbai: Public sector banks in India will need to raise up to $37 billion over the next 4-5 years to meet Basel III compliance norms, credit rating agency Moody's said on Monday.
The estimate is based on assumptions that there would be a moderate recovery in the economy and a gradual decline in the non-performing loans from the current levels.
"Our rated public-sector banks in the country will need to raise Rs 1.5-2.2 trillion, ($26-37 billion) between FY15 and the full implementation of Basel III in FY19," Moody's said in a report titled 'Indian banks could need $26-37 billion in external capital for Basel III compliance'.
A significant part of the required capital - Rs 80000-90000 crore ($13-15 billion) - could be in the form of additional Tier I (AT1) capital.
The agency rates 11 public sector banks in the country, representing 62 per cent of net loans in the banking system. Basel III raises the minimum required levels for both total Tier I capital to 7 per cent and common equity Tier I (CETI) capital to 5.5 per cent. They will also need to meet a capital conservation buffer in order to pay dividends.
"Public sector banks barely meet current minimum capital requirements, and we anticipate that they will find it difficult to raise capital quickly in the current environment," Moody's vice president Gene Fang said.
According to Moody's, low capital levels remain a key credit weakness for the public-sector banks.
Mr Fang said weak asset quality has depressed profitability and internal capital generation, leaving PSU banks reliant on periodic capital injections from the government.
"With Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration looking to reduce the budget deficit, the amount available for such injections is not likely to grow."
Moody's said banks may tap the equity markets to raise capital, but with still-low bank valuations, they could struggle to raise the required amount.

Reliance Jio  Indus Towers ink infrastructure sharing dealReliance Jio, Indus Towers ink infrastructure sharing deal
Our Bureau
Reliance Jio is getting ready to launch 4G mobile services in a phased manner, starting this year.
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
Firming up its plans to launch 4G services in the country, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) has signed an infrastructure agreement with Indus Towers. This follows a spate of similar agreements that RJIL, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, has entered into in the recent past.
Indus Towers – a three-way joint venture among Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular – has a portfolio of 1.14 lakh telecom towers across 15 circles.
“The agreement does not specify the number of towers. RJIL has the freedom to choose the towers that are suitable for its operations from the existing portfolio of towers,” said Sameer Sinha, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Indus Towers.
The towers would be leased out at prevailing market rates, he added.
“We are building our network through a combination of infrastructure networks that we are creating on our own and those that we are renting from quality partners. We already have such tower sharing agreements with all the major players in India, and this relationship with Indus Towers will further accelerate the rollout of our services,” said Sanjay Mashruwala, Managing Director at RJIL.
“Our agreement with Reliance Jio will also bring benefits to our existing customers in the form of lower rentals and energy costs. At the same time, the infrastructure sharing will help in avoiding duplication of towers and benefit the environment through lower power and fuel consumption,” said BS Shantharaju, Chief Executive Officer at Indus Towers.
Other 4G deals
RJIL holds spectrum in the 1800 MHz band across 14 circles and the 2300 MHz band in 22 circles and is capable of offering 4G services. The company is getting ready to launch 4G mobile services in a phased manner, starting this year.
Last week, RJIL entered into a similar agreement with GTL Infrastructure for about 27,800 towers, and in June, signed an agreement with Ascend Telecom for more than 4,500 towers. It also entered into similar agreements with Tower Vision for 8,400 towers in May, ATC India for 11,000 towers in April, Viom Networks for 42,000 towers and Bharti Infratel for 36,000 telecom towers in March.
RJIL also signed deals with Reliance Communications for 45,000 towers in June 2013. It had also entered into agreements with Bharti Airtel for comprehensive telecom infrastructure sharing (December 2013) and data connectivity (April 2013).

Villagers in Latehar district claim harassment by forestdepartmentTwo of the Latehar district harassment victims Bhikan Singh (Left) and Amrica Bhueya (Right) explaining the trouble caused by the forest department officials. (Source: Express photo by Manas Chaudhary)
Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Latehar | Posted: September 22, 2014 5:12 pm
About 100 people in four villages of Latehar district allege that the forest department is harassing them by filing frivolous cases, claiming some officials are working on the behest of local strongmen. All the villagers are from the Kope, Jerua, Jagthu and Lanka villages of Manika block.
The Indian Express has seen the details of 93 individuals, against whom at least 38 cases have been filed between 2007 and 2010. Most have multiple cases against them; they have been to jail for short periods. In all, the FD alleges they encroached upon nearly 600 acres of land. Apart from encroachment, people have been charged with stone mining and tree felling. The villagers deny all charges.
One of the 93 even alleges that he was jailed for 11 days even though the arrest warrant was in the name of someone who doesn’t exist. “The police came to my house asking for Korhi Bhuiyan, son of Tiru Bhuiyan. Tiru was my father’s brother but he died a few years back and had no children of his own,” said Amrika Bhuiyan of Jerua. Amrika produces notices from the FD and summons from a Latehar court he received in the name of the non-existent Korhi, accusing him of encroaching on four acres of forest land. “I never took those notices seriously. I kept telling the policemen that I am not Korhi, but they would not listen to me,” said Amrika, who is a Dalit and has Aadhaar, BPL, MNREGA and voters’ identity cards. All of the accused are adivasis, Dalits or Muslims.
The irony in the case is that the FD is now doing to these villagers what the Maoists did in 2011. In February 2011, the Maoists beat to death Jerua resident Niyamat Ansari, accusing him of helping villagers encroach on forest land. “The same contractors who encouraged the Maoists to go after Niyamat and me are now getting Forest officials to trouble us,” said Bhukan Singh, who used to work with Ansari on MNREGA and who was also a target for Maoists. Villagers say there is a caste divide to the antagonism – upper castes who have secured MNREGA contracts have been opposed to their claim to more pay.
There are 11 active cases against Bhukan now – Niyamat too, had been an accused in all of them at the time of his death. In all, the FD alleges he is part of encroachments amounting to 129 acres. “Tired with all of us shuttling between our village and the courts, I once told policemen to just jail us all for once. They laughed and said there continued…

Life goes on amid child deaths in Baran village; officials denymalnutritionPrint

Written by Sweta Dutta | Chaurakhadi (baran) | Posted: September 22, 2014 4:55 pm | Updated: September 23, 2014 2:04 am
In the weeks since Gehnawati’s year-old son Krishan died she and her husband Surma Sahariya had gone about with their usual life, hunting for work and fending for their five other children. Though it was heartbreaking to find their youngest child not wake up from sleep one morning, the couple from remote Chaurakhadi village in Baran district, are not unused to seeing children die in their community.
The Sahariyas, one of the most backward tribes concentrated in the state’s Baran district, have reported malnutrition and starvation deaths for over a decade now. The community is anything but utterly shocked to see their young ones die within the first few years of birth.
While Gehnawati had reason to be taken by surprise as the child, according to her showed no signs of illness, but just did not wake up from sleep in the morning on August 28, her neighbour Shivraj’s 10-month-old son Rinku was suffering from acute diarhhoea and died on August 30. “My child was perfectly fine. We have no idea what happened to him. He did not seem to have a fever or diarhhoea,” said Gehnawati.
Shivraj, however, consulted a local quack for his ailing son and was suggested some remedies. “The local doctor said he would be fine but he died a day later. He was suffering from acute diarhhoea,” explained Shivraj in a local tongue.
Shahbad block chief medical health officer, Lalit Rathore told the Indian Express, “Both the deaths were due to diarhhoea. The children were not malnourished.” However Rathore admitted that a post mortem was not conducted on either of the children and he also could not tell their weight or other health parameters to back his conclusion.
Reacting to the recent deaths, the state government sprung into action and admitted 47 malnourished children to the Shahbad MTC, 46 in Kishanganj and 9 in Mangrol. The children here are mostly below three years of age and are provided milk and vitamin supplements. The parents are given Rs. 200 per day to compensate for their daily wages.
Even as Rathore oversaw a bustling malnutrition center, he maintained, “Malnutrition is not such a big problem here. It is more about hygiene. The children crawl on the ground and put their dirty hands into their mouth leading to infection.” Asked if a meal of only rotis was sufficient in terms of nutritional value, Rathore said, “Wheat has all major nutrients. If children are brought to the continued…

CAG cant be blamed for UPA fall  says VinodRaiPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 4:54 pm
Refuting allegations of having political leanings, former CAG Vinod Rai has said that “credit or blame” for the fall of UPA regime cannot be squarely put on the apex auditor.
Rai – whose latest book ‘Not Just an Accountant’ – has triggered a political controversy, asserted that too much credit is being given to two or three audit findings and the Supreme Court rulings.
It is perceived that CAG findings in the cases of 2G spectrum and coal block allocations were among the major factors for the Congress-led UPA losing the general elections.
“I think it is giving too much of credit to two or three reports that came out or one or two decisions of Supreme Court because I think it is a very futile argument, just the way you said, that CAG has political leanings. When you have nothing to counter CAG on merit you say you have political leanings,” Rai told PTI in an interview.
The book touches upon happenings during Rai’s tenure from 2008-13 as the Comptroller and Auditor General as well as  about the role of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the previous UPA regime.
About allegations that his report was one of the reasons for the fall of Congress and rise of BJP, Rai said political parties should introspect on why the election results came the way it came.
“…it is (said) it is not the failings of the government but was reports of the CAG. I think it requires much more internal introspection for any of the political parties to do, I am not naming anybody, why the result came the way it came.
“I am certain that the credit or the blame cannot be squarely and only that of the reports of the CAG,” he noted.

(Indus Towers is a three-way…)
NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm has signed a deal with Indus Towers to share the latter's 1,13,490 towers as the Mukesh Ambani-led telecom company prepares to roll out high speed internet services on LTE next year.
In a joint statement on September 22, Reliance Jio said it had signed a master services agreement with the world's largest telecom tower provider that will allow Jio to use all of Indus' towers in 15 circles at prevailing market rates. The companies did not share the duration and the value of the deal. "We are continuing our effort to create a new age network which will provide innovative and empowering digital solutions to every Indian through our high speed 4G services," Reliance Jio's MD Sanjay Mashruwala said.
"The agreement will help in avoiding duplication of infrastructure and preserving the environment, while ensuring "seamless services to Jio customers through Indus' tower infrastructure", the statement added. Indus Towers is a threeway joint venture between India's No. 1 carrier Bharti Airtel, No. 2 Vodafone India and No. 3 Idea Cellular where the first two own 42% each.
"Our footprint in 15 circles in India, coupled with high network uptime levels, cost-effective solutions, faster access to market and lower operational costs will provide Jio a robust and seamless telecom infrastructure," BS Shantharaju, CEO at Indus Towers, said. The agreement will also bring cost benefits to Jio in the form of lower rentals and energy costs, he added.
Reliance Jiois gearing up to start offering high-speed, broadband or 4G services, taking on rivals, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India, amid increasing data usage by the country's mobile phone subscribers.
The company owns pan-India airwaves in the 2300 MHz band since May 2010, but it is yet to roll out services. It must do so by May 2015 as per the licence obligation at the time of sale. It also bought airwaves in the 1800 MHz band in a government auction in February. On both bands, it plans to launch fourth-generation data services, along with second-generation voice service on the 1800 MHz band.
With the latest tie-up with Indus Towers, Reliance Jio will have access to over 288,000 towers countrywide. It has already tied up with major infrastructure providers and telecom companies that own towers since April 2013, including Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications, Viom Networks and Bharti Infratel, a unit of Bharti Airtel.
Jio has also partnered with Bharti Airtel to share infrastructure created by both parties. It also shares RCom's inter-city and intra-city optic fiber apart from 45,000 towers.

State-run banks need $37 bn to meet Basel II...BASEL III norms
(The estimate is based on…)
MUMBAI: Rating company Moody's has said that capital requirement for government owned Indian banks may rise to 8% to $37 billion as the economic recovery could raise the demand for loans. It would be difficult for banks to raise the needed capital if the economic reforms do not lead to lower government's holdings in banks.
Assuming a moderate recovery in economic growth and a gradual decline in new non-performing loans (NPLs), Moody's has estimated that rated public-sector banks in India will need to raise Rs 1.5 - Rs2.2 trillion ($26 - $37 billion) in Tier 1 capital externally between FY'15 and full implementation of Basel III in FY' 19. The estimate is equivalent to 42%-61% of public-sector banks' aggregate market cap (as of 12 September 2014), the ratings firm has norm. Basel II are the new capital norms prescribed for banks globally by the Bank of International Settlements head quartered in Basel, Switerland.
A study by the ratings firm of the banks it rates noted that in the three years between FY'11 and FY'14, annual loan growth at rated public-sector banks averaged 18%, while pre-provision income declined to 2.6% of risk weighted assets or RWA from 3.3% of RWA. " Weak asset quality has depressed public-sector banks' profitability and ability to generate capital internally, leaving them reliant on periodic capital injections from the government." Moody's said in a release.
The implementation of Basel III requirements will raise the minimum required capital levels for both total Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. By March 2015, the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio will increase to 7.0% while the minimum for CET1 capital will rise to 5.5%. In addition to these minimum requirements, a Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB), needed for banks to pay dividends, will be phased in starting from March 2016. As a result, the total Tier 1 capital required to meet transitional minimum requirements and the transitional CCB will exceed the current 8.0% Tier 1 target by FY2017.
Injections of public money will provide some support, but there are constraints as the new administration under prime minister Narendra Modi looks to reduce the country's budget deficit. Banks could use the listed equity markets to raise capital, but current valuations may limit the feasibility of raising large amounts of money through this avenue. Even after hopes for the new government boosted Indian stock prices by more than 30% in the past six months, most Indian public-sector banks still trade at a discount to their book value, Moody's said.

Pakistan appoints ally of army chief to head intelligence agencyprint
Pakistan appointed a close confidante of the army chief as head of the Inter-Services Intelligence on Monday, a move that suggested General Raheel Sharif was consolidating his position amid political instability in the country.
The appointment of Lieutenant General Rizwan Akhtar, part of a major reshuffle in the military, is aimed at cementing the army’s dominance after weeks of anti-government protests in Pakistan. Akhtar will assume his responsibilities on November 8.
Political observers were surprised at Akhtar’s appointment as he has considerable experience in counter-insurgency from a previous posting in the troubled Waziristan and tribal areas but little in intelligence work.
Akhtar's previous job was head of the paramilitary Rangers in the province of Sindh in the south, where he led a comprehensive operation against Islamist groups and criminal gangs in Karachi.
The head of the ISI is one of the most important posts in Pakistan, at the intersection of domestic politics, the war on militancy and Pakistan's foreign relations. Although the ISI officially reports to the prime minister, in reality it is controlled by the army chief, in this case General Raheel Sharif.
Political observers were also surprised at Akhtar’s appointment because prime minister Nawaz Sharif had replaced him when he was director general of Sindh Rangers while an operation against militants was on in Karachi.
Some observers wondered if this would lead to more animosity between the two as he was removed from the command position owing to differences of opinion between the army high command and the political leadership.
At the same time, many officials and analysts said Akhtar’s choice as the head of the ISI was an indication of the importance the army chief placed on the ongoing operation in Waziristan and tribal areas.
A graduate of the Command and Staff College Quetta, National Defence University and the US Army War College, Akhtar was commissioned in the Frontier Force Regiment in September 1982.

Profitability drives growth of new main streets: C&W
There are four primary demand drivers for the emergence of new main streets: increasing urban sprawl, improving accessibility, increased organized retail penetration and high average trading densities in the new retail locations.
Post your opinion here
 
Cushman & Wakefield
Cushman & Wakefield’s latest report ‘NEW RETAIL FRONTIERS : EMERGING MAIN STREETS IN INDIA’, analyses the potential of new locations, which are emerging as retail hotspots in the seven major cities of Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and Hyderabad. In each city, two emerging main streets, which hold high potential were analyzed to understand the reasons propelling their emergence. Urban sprawl was the most prominent driver in most emerging main streets with a few exceptions. Ambattur (MTH Road) in Chennai is emerging due to the metamorphosis of area from an industrial area to an alternative IT-ITeS hub. In Sahakar Nagar (Bengaluru) and NSC Bose Road (Kolkata), the proximity and good connectivity to major infrastructure nodes and transport hubs is the primary cause driving their emergence.
There are four primary demand drivers for the emergence of new main streets: increasing urban sprawl, improving accessibility, increased organized retail penetration and high average trading densities in the new retail locations. Due to the large scale migration and urbanization, the city limits of major seven cities are expanding to include newer far-away localities. These outlying zones are gradually evolving as self-sustaining hubs with new residential neighborhoods and new retail main streets to serve them. Better accessibility through improved transportation means and reluctance of consumers to shop in congested established main streets that are situated further, have drawn the buyers to these newer main streets. Popular brands in the mid-end segment start setting up shops in these newer main streets and attracting more footfalls. The rentals in these main streets are quite low and the landlords are quite flexible on the lease terms such as lease duration, fit-out rent, lock-in etc. Thus, the growth in demand and low rentals directly translates into higher profitability for the brands, which further drives the emergence of these main streets.  Despite the 25-35% rise in rentals over the previous two years, the emerging main street rentals are still on an average 20-30% lower than other established retail locations across the cities.

What is right cost for your asset purchaseMore about the Expert...
Arnav Pandya
There is often a challenge to get the cost figures right when it comes to the question of calculation of capital gains on an asset that is actually sold and there are gains that are earned here. This would require that all the elements are accounted for especially since the purchase might have been made several years and in some cases decades back and hence this might not be easy to actually get. In that sense actually getting to the root of all the details is something that might not be easy to achieve. Here is a close look at all the details and the manner in which this would actually impact the workings for the tax.
Sales price
The easiest part of the process is actually arriving at the sales price of the property due to the fact that this is something that would cause some effort on the part of the individual especially when this is an old property. The sale price is available right then as the transaction has just been completed at this particular price and there is also a sale deed present which can be referred to for the details related to the property and hence this is something that can be immediately accessed. This completes half of the required work due to the fact that one part of the entire transaction is completed and hence the other aspect is what remains and this would need to be undertaken.
Plot price
When it comes to a house property there are often a couple of details that would be required and one of them is the purchase price of the plot that has been sold now. If there was a simple purchase of a constructed house property then this would require a single step of determining the purchase price of the property but often there is a bigger challenge due to the fact that there was a plot of land that was bought and then in addition there was construction that was made on the plot. This would require the cost price for both these efforts. As far as the plot price is concerned it would be the easier thing to get due to the fact that there might be a receipt or even proof of the payment made for this when this was purchased and this would simplify the process.
Construction
There could be a situation where the plot was purchased at one point of time and then construction on this took place later. This would require going in later and then determining the cost of the construction that has actually taken place. This could be really difficult due to the fact that getting all the cost figures together especially after a long period of time and in terms of having the bills for the expenses incurred might not be easy. There are a lot of parts about the property construction that actually requires cash and hence in this kind of situation if there are not adequate records that are available then the gathering process could turn out to be difficult to achieve. This is significant because unless the cost is present the cost inflation index cannot be applied to it for the purpose of arriving at the final amount that would be taxable and hence this requires some attention. IF for some reason the property is very old then one has to see whether this was bought before 1 April 1981 as then this would actually ensure that the value as on that particular date would be present which can be used for the various calculations.

Possession-linked vs construction-linked plansLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3
Possession-linked vs construction-linked plans
Buyers see immense benefits in paying just 20-25% to the developer while booking and paying the balance amount on possession. This eradicates the risk of developer not completing the project on time, and of the developer going bankrupt and not having to pay for a product that is not yet ready.
Post your opinion here
Om Ahuja
JLL India
The current market scenario clearly reflects the market mood. Developers are extending many offers to attract demand, clearly indicating that buyers are in wait and watch mode. Various press articles have been suggesting price correction for over last three quarters, but we have not seen any serious correction in prices (with a few exceptions in some markets). Developers are proffering bundled offers instead of negotiating prices. One such offer is the possession-linked payment plan, in which the buyer pays 20-25% of the apartment cost in advance and the rest on possession.
The benefits of possession-linked plans
A critical point here is delivery risk and exposure of credit to developer. Buyers see immense benefits in paying just 20-25% to the developer while booking and paying the balance amount on possession. This eradicates the risk of developer not completing the project on time, and of the developer going bankrupt and not having to pay for a product that is not yet ready.   
We are seeing buyers favouring this option against the construction-linked plans. In the developed world, builders have to complete the product before they can sell to their buyer. Selling before completion is called ‘off-plan’ and this can be approved by the local regulator, but only on the basis of a special request and the overall credibility of the developer. Such checks are missing in India. With possession-linked plans, the benefit to buyers must always be seen in the light of multiple risks.
Points to check before opting for such a plan
Three critical safeguards that buyers must put in place before investing into such offers are:
1. Ensuring that the developer does not have two different pricing structures (i.e. one for construction-linked and another for possession-linked plans).  If there are two such different pricing offers, then the developer has already built in the cost of funding that is applicable for a possession-linked plan. This effectively means that the buyer is indirectly funding the developer, and that is not an attractive scenario.
2. Establishing that the developer has all necessary approvals in place. Buyers funding the developers without approvals is like any another non-approved deposit collection scheme that can catch the eye of financial regulators like SEBI and RBI. Buyers need to use caution while investing in any project where approvals are yet to come and there is a assured-return type of structure. These are very risky structures and have high chances of default and delay in terms of payments.
3. Reading the fine print. Laypeople generally do not read those critical few lines at the end of the document before investing, but there is a huge risk of losing money by such oversight. For instance, the connotations of terms such as ‘Act of God’ as well as other obscure verbiage in the terms and conditions present a risk to buyers that do not understand them. Any condition that de-risks or absolves the developer can be perceived as a risk of losing the 20-25% of the initial investment. It is therefore prudent for the buyer to review all points mentioned in such an agreement.
What happens if the buyer defaults on payments?
The developer will cancel the sale agreement and basis the agreement has the full right to forfeit the initial payment of the buyer. Reputed developers only forfeit part of the initial amount, not the full amount. This is normally captured in the options agreement that the buyer will sign with the developer.
Risks involved in possession-linked plans
Many times, buyers go for construction-linked plans and developers draw 90% of the amount from the bank providing home loan. Delay by the developer in terms of delivering the finished product can sometimes extend to 2-5 years or more, and for various reasons. Buyers continue to bear the interest cost for the amount that the bank has funded the developer with, but cannot enjoy the finished product.  
In a possession-linked plan, the risk involved is limited to the initial capital of 20-25% that a buyer pays to book the apartment. Buyers clearly stand to gain from a possession-linked plan as it reduces their risk and ensures that they do not have to bear the cost of funding the developer with multiple open risks.  
Because of various potential policy changes after the elections, these plans may not be available very long. It is therefore a very good time for buyers to invest in projects that offer possession-linked plans.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a fifth straight weekly advance after China's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and its euro zone peer announced asset purchases in efforts to boost each region's economy.
The gains were broad on a day when both the Dow and S&P 500 ended at closing records. All ten primary S&P 500 industry sectors ended the day higher, while 63 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory. About 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed names were higher on the day.
The People's Bank of China said it was cutting one-year benchmark lending rates for the first time in more than two years.
The move came after European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said "excessively low" inflation had to be raised quickly by whatever means necessary, rekindling expectations the ECB will move to stimulate the euro zone economy. The ECB said it started buying asset-backed securities to encourage banks to lend and revive the economy.
"It isn't the size of the moves but the shock value of the direction that is really lifting markets today," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets. "This is a one-two punch for global growth."
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 88.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,807.94, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 10.7 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,063.45 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.10 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,712.97.
Both the Dow and S&P ended at records. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P added 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent. It was the fifth straight weekly advance for all three.
Gains in the Nasdaq were limited by declines in large-cap tech companies. Microsoft Corp  fell 1.5 percent to $47.97 while Netflix Inc  slid 2.1 percent to $360.28.
GameStop Corp  sank 13 percent to $37.86 a day after the video game retailer posted quarterly revenue and earnings well below expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500.
The benchmark index's biggest gainers were Ross Stores  and Autodesk Inc , both of which rallied after results late Thursday. Ross jumped 7.3 percent to $89.27 while Autodesk was up 6.1 percent to $61.95.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,029 to 1,039, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,461 issues rose and 1,286 fell, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 96 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 44 new lows.
About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the month-to-date average of 6.35 billion.

Colgate: Getting more shineColgate-Palmolive: Getting more shine
Sheetal Agarwal | Mumbai Sep 22, 2014 09:35 PM IST
Colgate-Palmolive India Limited (Colgate)’s stock has witnessed six-seven ratings upgrade to ‘Buy’ from ‘Hold’ in September alone. Expectations of strong margin gains in FY15 and FY16, continued innovations and strong earnings visibility are some reasons this.
The scrip had under-performed the S&P BSE Sensex until recently largely due to the concerns surrounding entry of its peer, Procter and Gamble (P&G), in the toothpaste segment via the Oral-B brand. But, these concerns are easing. To maintain its leadership position in the segment, Colgate became aggressive not only on advertising and promotions, but on new launches. This has helped Colgate expand its market share (up 110 basis points to 57 per cent in past one year) in the segment.
Additionally, while these gains came at the cost of its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin, which contracted 220 basis points year-on-year to 18.6 per cent in FY14 (P&G entered India's toothpaste market in June 2013), margins have rebounded to 20.4 per cent in the June 2014 quarter.
Analysts expect Colgate to register Ebitda margin gains of 100 basis points this financial year and about 80 basis points in FY16, driven by stable ad spends (as a per cent of sales). Colgate's advertising and promotional spends (as a per cent of sales) had surged over 350 basis points year-on-year to 19.4 per cent in FY14. However, as Colgate has garnered additional market share and the fact that Oral-B toothpaste has not seen much success, analysts expect this metric to hover around 19.3-19.5 per cent levels in FY15 as well as FY16 and thus aid margins.
Besides margin recovery, Colgate's volume growth trends, too, have been encouraging. Notwithstanding a four per cent volume fall in toothpaste industry in June 2014 quarter, Colgate's volume grew by five per cent. Analysts expect the company's volume growth to be around nine per cent this financial year and inch up to about 10-11 per cent in FY16 on the back of continuous innovations. It has also maintained its leadership position in toothbrush segment with market share of 42.6 per cent.
Colgate also plans to focus on premiumisation (therapeutic segment, sensitivity, cavity protection) and increase its rural footprint to fuel further growth. Analysts expect its net income to grow at compound annual growth rate of 22 per cent over FY14-17. The stock currently trades at 33.5 times FY16 estimated earnings, but lower than peak valuations of 43.7 times.

Scotland should avoid Quebec s fateScotland should avoid Quebec's fate
By Alanna Petroff   @AlannaPetroff September 19, 2014: 11:54 AM ET
LONDON (CNNMoney)
Scotland's clear rejection of independence has eased fears that it could suffer the kind of decline seen in Quebec after it failed to break away from Canada.
Quebec held two votes on independence -- in 1980 and then again in 1995 -- and in their wake suffered years of slower growth than the rest of the country.
While plenty of risks remain for Britain, the margin of defeat suffered by independence campaigners should save Scotland from damaging open ended uncertainty.
"This means that longer term investors will not fear a fresh referendum, preventing any adverse impact on direct investment flows into the U.K.," said HSBC in a report.
Just over 55% of Scots voted to remain in the U.K. during Thursday's referendum -- a bigger majority than expected -- and analysts say the chances of another referendum are slim.
They were further reduced Friday by the resignation of Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond.
Related: Markets rally as Scotland votes to stay
Had Scottish voters opted to stay in the U.K. by only a small margin, money may have continued to flow out of Scotland. Investors would have been nervous about committing to an uncertain future.
Annual growth in Quebec averaged 2.3% between 1981 and 2006, significantly weaker than Canada's overall rate of 3%, according to the Montreal Economic Institute.
"The prolonged uncertainty between 1980 and 1995 is often cited by commentators as a factor in Canada's economic difficulties in the 1990s," Canadian lawmakers said in a 2013 report.

Still, despite the conclusive nature of Thursday's vote, Scottish leaders will need to act quickly to rebuild business confidence.
"It will be important for the Scottish government to assuage the business community there to neutralize any risks," said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec.
Some major Scottish businesses, including the Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ), threatened to move their headquarters south of the border if the nation broke away. Others were worried about the impact of a split on trade and prices, echoing fears expressed by Quebec businesses in the 1990s.

How You Can Be A Valuable Partner To A Global Companyreddit
Large companies increasingly rely on a strategic rolodex of industry experts to help them stay ahead of the industry. They recognize that they can't be the best at everything and small businesses can add real value in areas where they would like to expand. By providing critical industry and technical expertise, necessary skill sets and creative ideas that are feasible, small businesses can help distinguish large corporations from their competitors and serve as a strategic ally at the same time.
Through our experience, there are six key tips that you should know when working with a big company:
1. Don't Be intimidated. Small businesses deserve a seat at the table. If you believe in your product or service, convey that. Big companies don't always have the expertise you do and for this reason, you bring tremendous value. Don't let the name on the building instill fear in you - have confidence and show value by being the expert in your area.
2. Be Indispensable. Many large companies currently have a reduced staff due to budget restrictions or lack of resources, making it difficult to tackle challenges and retain quality personnel. Whatever the reason for internal cutbacks, you shouldn't be concerned because you are the solution! Leverage your expertise and seize the opportunity!
3. Exhibit Your Knowledge In Highly Targeted Spaces. Many executives in large companies juggle numerous challenges at once, causing them to become overwhelmed and spread too thin. This is an opportunity to show those senior executives what you can bring to the table: a targeted expertise in an area they see as a tricky issue. By becoming their preferred "go-to" subject matter expert in the space, your value and business will quickly be viewed as a reliable source for future projects.
4. Don't Be Afraid To Ask! The advantage of proving your company's worth within a large organization is the opportunity to expand beyond its current scope and into other projects throughout the corporation. If you are getting kudos on longer assignments or projects, don't be shy about asking for introductions to other colleagues. If your liaison wants to keep you "close to the vest," ask for introductions outside the U.S. in global corporations, where there typically isn't a conflict between U.S. and Global business units.
5. Create A Road Map. Not only will this help you keep focused on the project at hand, but you can also show ongoing opportunities to the corporation that they may not even be thinking about. This will also enable you to collaborate on research & development ventures that can be leveraged in new ways.
6. Don't Let Yourself Get Pushed Around Or Give Away Things For Free. Remember that your work and product has real value. Never put yourself in a place to feel diminished. At the end of the day, if you value your work, they will too.

U.S. options clearinghouse CEO to retire after year in top spotU.S. options clearinghouse CEO to retire after year in top spot
By Reuters
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission CME Group Inc.
The chief executive of the clearinghouse for all U.S. stock options will retire from the company at the end of the year after one year in the role, the company said on Friday.
Chicago-based OCC, formerly known as the Options Clearing Corp., did not immediately say why CEO Michael Cahill, 56, is retiring or what his plans are. He has worked at the clearinghouse for 32 years and was promoted to CEO from president, chief operating officer and treasurer on Jan. 1.

The clearinghouse came under regulatory scrutiny last year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission criticized regulatory compliance, governance and risk management at the company, according to media reports.
OCC's board of directors has started the process of searching for a new CEO, according to a statement.
Executive Chairman Craig Donohue, 52, a former chief of exchange-operator CME Group Inc will oversee a transition of Cahill's responsibilities to other OCC executives during the search, the statement said. Chief Operating Officer Michael McClain, 46, will take on the additional title of president as part of the transition.
OCC processes trades for all 12 U.S. options exchanges and for some futures markets. It has nearly 120 clearing members that include the biggest U.S. broker-dealers, futures commission merchants and non-U.S. securities firms.
CME Group on Monday said it too was reshuffling its senior executives.

Sidelined by disability and saddled with student loansBy Danielle Douglas-Gabriel September 19 Follow @DaniDougPost
Soon after graduating from college, Edgar Zakata had a disabling worsening of his epilepsy. Unable to work, he wondered how he would ever repay student loans. (Photo by Nader Khouri for The Washington Post)
Within months of receiving his diploma from Vanguard University near Los Angeles in May 2012, Edgar Zakata started having multiple seizures. He had suffered from epilepsy for most of his life, but medication had always kept the convulsions at bay. Not anymore.
Before he could put his psychology degree to use, Zakata began experiencing up to seven seizures a day. There were visits to the emergency room. There were CAT scans and cocktails of medications to get his condition under control. Nothing worked.
A series of tests suggested it was likely that nothing could be done to prevent the seizures from disrupting his life. He wouldn’t be able to hold down a steady job. And with no source of income, there was no way he could repay the $33,000 he owed in federal and private student loans.
Zakata’s prospects were bad enough for the Department of Education to discharge the $25,000 he owed the government, but not for Sallie Mae to grant a similar disability waiver for the $8,000 it was due.
Instead, the private lender demanded more medical records, more doctors’ letters, more proof. Two years later, the battle is emblematic of the disparities between federal and private student debt collection.
Education loans provided by banks and other financial firms carry fewer protections for the borrower than those offered by the federal government. Private lenders are under no obligation to work with borrowers when they fall behind on payments or, as in Zakata’s case, are unable to repay the debt because of a disability.
Whereas the federal government has rules for income-based repayment, forbearance and waivers for severe disability, there are no industry-wide equivalents governing private lenders. Instead, each bank or financial firm decides whether to institute those policies, and not all do.
Private student loans represent about $104 billion of the $1.12 trillion in outstanding education debt, according to the New York Federal Reserve. There is no clear data on the number of private student lenders, though by some estimates there are fewer than a hundred banks, credit unions and other financial outfits in the market.
Only four private student loan providers — Sallie Mae, Wells Fargo, Discover and New York Higher Education Services Corp. — will cancel a borrowers’ debt in cases of permanent disability. Each has policies that are largely based on the federal government’s guidelines that call for a certified letter from a physician or a Social Security Administration notice of award.
Private lenders are generally opaque about their standards and don’t apply them across the board to all of their loans, said Persis Yu, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. Lenders have said some of their loans have been bundled into securities with contract restrictions that prevent adjustments for individual borrowers.
“There is no law that requires them to do anything in the case of disability or death, so borrowers are subject to their individual whims,” Yu said.
Lawmakers are starting to take notice of the disparities. In June, Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) proposed a provision as part of a higher education package that would require schools to work only with private lenders that discharge loans in the event of a student’s death or permanent disability. While the provision would create some parity between federal and private loans, it offers no guarantee that borrowers like Zakata would be granted a waiver.
Zakata, now 34 and living with his parents in Napa, Calif., tried to stay on top of his student loans as his epilepsy worsened. Hoping that doctors would find a way to control the seizures so he could work, he initially sought to defer his student loan payments.
A CAT scan in February 2013 revealed a tumor on the left side of his brain that doctors suspected caused the sudden escalation of his condition. But days before a surgery to remove the tumor, Zakata said, his doctor canceled the procedure out of concern that the risks would outweigh the benefits. Doctors determined that Zakata had severe refractory epilepsy, a drug-resistent condition.
“He said it was incurable,” Zakata said. “I was in shock and just crying, thinking, ‘What’s my life going to be like? How was I going to pay the money I owed?’ ”
Edgar Zakata keeps a bag of seizure medications he tried, unsuccessfully, after his epilepsy suddenly worsened.  He keeps affirmations in Spanish on the wall of his room. Payments on his federal student loans were waived because of his condition, but Sallie Mae at first denied a similar accommodation. (Photos by Nader Khouri for The Washington Post)
Zakata’s physician recommend he contact his lenders to explain the extent of his disability and seek help. He did.
It took four months before the federal government granted him the waiver, after requesting his medical records and letters from doctors.
Zakata supplied the same documentation to Sallie Mae, but with a different outcome.
Sallie Mae denied his request, saying Zakata had a pre-existing condition that he was aware of when he took out the loans in 2011.
The disability waiver is available only to students who become “permanently disabled because of a condition that began or deteriorated” after the date they obtained the loan, said Nikki Lavoie, a spokeswoman for Navient, the student-loan servicing company that was spun out of Sallie Mae in April and now has Zakata’s loan.
“The guy at Sallie Mae told me, ‘If I knew I had seizures, then why did I apply?’ ” Zakata said.
“I told him that at the time, they were under control. I had a life. I was driving. I had a job. I didn’t know this was going to happen.”
Zakata didn’t give up. By the end of March, he contacted legal aid and began working with an attorney to appeal the lender’s decision. The debt collection calls stopped, and Sallie Mae agreed to have its processing partner, Minnesota Life, review the case again.
But it was far from over.
The lender wanted all of his medical records dating to 2010, proof from the state that his drivers license had been revoked because of his condition and information about his Social Security disability application.
“They’re not disputing that he is permanently disabled,” said Noah Zinner, a senior attorney at Housing and Economic Rights Advocates who represents Zakata. “Periodically they deny him, and then when he follows up, they request all of these new documents.”
Zakata tried to run down the requested material, which meant contacting at least five doctors and three medical centers.
“We sympathize with our customers experiencing medical concerns and rely on the expertise of an experienced third party for timely, consistent and fair processing of disability applications,” Lavoie said.
She added that Navient works with customers facing financial challenges to, in some cases, reduce the interest rate on the loan or lower payments. Roughly $1.7 billion of the private loans the company services are enrolled in a loan modification program.
Navient encouraged Zakata to sign up for a loan modification. The company asked for his household income and for his parents to make payments on the loan, which was in default.
But Navient notified The Washington Post near the end of August that, upon further review, the company had decided to grant Zakata the disability waiver. Zakata, who learned of the decision from a reporter, was relieved. Days later, he received a call from the company informing him of the news. The debt has been discharged.

Alibaba s big debut: Here are the 10 things you want to knowChina's e-commerce giant Alibaba began trading its shares Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Here are ten things to know about Alibaba, and why its initial public offering made history:
The biggest
Alibaba raised $21.8 billion in its debut, making it the biggest US-listed IPO in history after the IPO of credit card processing company Visa in 2008. If Alibaba's investment banks were to exercise their option to sell an additional 48 million shares, it could make Alibaba's IPO the biggest in the world, beating out the $22 billion IPO of Agricultural Bank of China in 2010.
Don't forget Yahoo!
It may have been a big day for Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma, but Yahoo's investors are feeling pretty good after Alibaba's IPO. Yahoo was an early investor in Alibaba, paying $1 billion for a stake in the company in 2005. Yahoo likely made $8.3 billion to $9.5 billion in Alibaba's IPO, and will still own a 16% stake in the company worth $37.7 billion.
Alibaba eclipises Silicon Valley
Alibaba now has a market capitalization of roughly $219.8 billion, according to FactSet. That makes the company bigger than some of the US technology industry's most successful names, such as Facebook, eBay, and even Amazon.com.
All in one
Investors are interested in Alibaba because the company dominates many businesses in China that, here in the US, are run by individual companies. Alibaba owns the websites Tmall and Taobao, which are similar to Amazon.com and eBay, respectively. The company also earns money from transaction fees related to its various businesses through Alipay, which is like PayPal. That's just three of Alibaba's many subsidiaries.
Big profits
Unlike the US e-commerce giant Amazon, Alibaba has been consistently profitable. The company had $8.5 billion in sales in its latest fiscal year ending in March, with net income of $3.8 billion. The year prior, Alibaba had $5.4 billion in sales and $1.4 billion in profits. In comparison, Amazon sold $74.4 billion in goods in 2013, but made only $274 million in profits that year. In 2012, Amazon reported a net loss of $39 million.
Risks
If Alibaba does well for investors, it will be the exception to what has been the trend for Chinese companies. When Chinese companies have listed stocks on American markets, their shares have lost an average 1% a year for the next three years, compared with an average 7% annual gain for other US IPOs, according to research by Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida.
Second time around
This isn't Alibaba's first time going public. Alibaba took its online shopping portal Alibaba.com public in 2007 in Hong Kong. Alibaba.com was a publicly traded company only for a few years. Alibaba took Alibaba.com private in 2012.
Solid gold
Jack Ma, who started Alibaba in 1999 in his apartment in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, is now among the richest people in the world. Ma's ownership in the company is worth roughly $18.2 billion, based on Alibaba's closing share price Friday. That doesn't include the shares he sold in the IPO, which are worth another $867 million, and his other investments. Bloomberg put his entire net worth at $21.9 billion, making him the 34th richest person in the world.
Big win for NYSE
Alibaba chose to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the second A-list technology company to go public on the Big Board in less than a year. The NYSE handled Twitter's IPO last year. NYSE's competitor, the Nasdaq Stock Market, has struggled to win the business of big tech companies since Facebook's IPO in 2012, which was plagued with technical problems.
Life is like a box of...
Jack Ma biggest hero is the fictional character Forrest Gump. "I really like that guy," Ma said, in an interview with business channel CNBC on Friday. "Every time I'm frustrated, I watch the movie. (The movie tells) me that no matter whatever changed, you are you."

1.5 billion tonnes of coal set to be burnt in Jharkhand  W Bengal1.5 billion tonnes of coal set to be burnt in Jharkhand, W Bengal
Sandeep Pai , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 19, 2014
First Published: 23:51 IST(19/9/2014) | Last Updated: 00:50 IST(20/9/2014)

Even as the country is reeling under a power crisis due to shortage of coal, about 1.5 billion tonnes of coal is set to be burnt down in underground fires in Jharia and Raniganj coalfields in Jharkhand and West Bengal, respectively, over the next few years.
Studies by Coal India Limited (CIL) have assessed that about 37 million tonnes of coal have already been burnt down in Jharia (Jharkhand) and Raniganj (West Bengal) and about 1.45 billion tonnes of coal will burn up if no remedial action is taken.
CIL’s annual production of about 450 MT is way short of the demand. As a result, India imports about 160 million tonnes of coal every year.
More importantly, the lives of hundreds of thousands of people living in this are in danger as parts of the earth’s surface, some if it with human habitations, can cave in if the coal bearing blocks underground burn to ashes.
While Jharia has a mix of coking and non-coking coal, Raniganj has only non-coking coal, which is used by power plants. If the coal in these mines could be prevented from burning down and, instead, mined, then India’s coal shortage can be substantially averted.
In Jharia and Raniganj, large scale underground fires were detected in the 1970’s. These originated from spontaneous combustion occurring due to unscientific coal mining techniques. Those fires have only grown in scale as the government has not been able to do much about them.
“As a first step we have to quickly shift people from Jharia and rehabilitate them elsewhere. Thereafter, we must quickly mine this trapped coal,” said B Akala, former chairman and managing director of Central Mine Planning and Design Institute, a subsidiary of CIL. 
Union coal and power minister Piyush Goyal said the government had planned to shift the population from the underground coal fire affected areas. “For this, CIL needs land, which is not being provided by the state governments,” he said.
The minister agreed that thousands of lives are in danger as they are staying near the underground fire zone.
After years of deliberations, the government finally approved a master plan for addressing the issues arising out of these fires in August 2009. The outlay: Rs. 7,112.11 crore for Jharia and Rs. 2,661.73 crore for Raniganj. The timeframe to resolve the issue: 10 years.
Five years have passed but little improvement is visible on the ground. The fires continue to rage the rehabilitation process is slipshod, residents said. “Only about Rs. 300 crores out of the Rs. 10,000 crore allotted has been spent so far,” said Ashok Agarwal, executive president of a local organisation, Save Jharia Coalfields Committee
Union coal secretary SK Srivastava did not respond to a detailed questionnaire sent to him on September 10.
“Bharat Coking Coal was supposed to provide land for the Jharia Action Plan. However, it provided 850 acres of disputed land. This has made things difficult for us,” said Gopal Ji, rehabilitation & development officer, Jharia Rehabilitation Development Authority.
Meanwhile, billions of tonnes of coal continue to smoulder below the surface and thousands of people continue to live in fear.

India to rank among worlds biggest aviation mkts: British AirwaysComments
India is going to be one of the biggest aviation markets in the world and British Airways (BA) wants to be a grab  a chunk of the pie.
“India is our biggest market after North America and is absolutely critical part of BA network. We are putting a lot of emphasis and investing a lot in terms of our brand. India is strategically one of the most important markets we fly. It’s a massive market for BA,” Christopher Fordyce, the airline’s regional commercial manager, South Asia told HT.
BA, which is celebrating 90 years of flying to India, operates 48 flights a week to five Indian cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai.
“One of the big things is that we have been flying here for 90 years. Some other carriers have come in and gone and they haven’t been able to make it work. The fact that we have been here for so long and have been growing is a good indicator of us having the right product and we are looking to be here for another 90 years,” Fordyce said.
At the moment, Fordyce said, BA didn’t have any plans to operate the A380 in India or invest in an Indian carrier. “We continue to review as the market grows and if we are able to be as successful as we have been so far there is no reason why we won’t love to bring bigger aircraft,” he said.
“What we are really focusing at the moment is making sure we have got the right frequency particularly in Delhi and Mumbai,” he added.
BA, which operates Boeing 787 Dreamliner to Hyderabad, may operate the aircraft to other Indian cities as well. “We are looking at new places to fly to and India is definitely on that list,” he added.

Decide on media freedom in National Media Policy: TRAInews media
Telecom and broadcast regulator TRAI chairman Rahul Khullar on Saturday said that government should make it clear in a national media policy that politicians and governments and their organs should not be in the business of broadcast.
“Politicians...Government, state government, their organs have absolutely no business whatsoever being in broadcasting and platform space. It is my view that government needs to announce this as integral part in national media policy,” he said while speaking at CII Big Picture Summit.
Dr. Khullar cited points from recommendation of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on media ownership and said that governments, politicians and their related bodies should not be in the business of broadcast platform space.
TRAI had earlier given recommendation on barring entry of certain parties and entities in November 2008 but government did not implement it.
“Let me tell you what I think should be component of National Media Policy. First, there must be a clear articulation that we want a free media - unhampered and unrestricted by the government in any way whatsoever,” Dr. Khullar said.
The regulator again issued recommendation on media ownership last month that suggested restriction on political bodies and corporates entering the television and newspaper business.
“At this point of time I can not tell you what the government will or will not do. I firmly believe that it is time for us to have national debate on whether we can allow practices such as largely prevalent in media and practices such as Chief Minister’s controlling media distribution platform, without harming national interest,” he said.
Dr. Khullar added that besides this, media should have safeguard and must be regulated by an independent regulator.
“Simultaneously, the media itself must be subject to safeguards, whether that comes through other forms of independent regulator. You cannot have an institution which has right but no duties,” he said.
Dr. Khullar said that government should start taking decision on infrastructure for broadcast sector and end complications that hamper businesses.
“On spectrum availability - what a nightmare it is to deal with an office in Bangalore to try and get transponders in place. I have tried my best in beating my head against that wall. It’s like a catch 22 situation. I will not give you a transponder and I will not let you get a transponder on your own,” Dr. Khullar said.
He said for a FM radio license, a person has to run between Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Department of Telecom which should be eased now.

Apples dangerous game  part 2: The strongest counterargumentBy Orin Kerr September 22
My Friday morning post on Apple’s new iOS8 operating system pretty much kicked the hornet’s nest, both here and on Twitter. In this post, I want to discuss what I think is the strongest counterargument made against my post. It’s a good argument, and it has pushed me to change my view from “very troubled” to “need more information to decide.” In later posts, I’ll hope to address other arguments, most of which I found much less persuasive.
Recall that my question in the earlier post asked, “What’s the public interest in thwarting lawful search warrants?” I thought the best response was along the lines of the following, with the text below my best effort at expressing the position:
Although it’s unfortunate that Apple’s new approach will thwart lawful search warrants, the benefit to the public outweighs that loss. Under Apple’s old operating system, Apple maintained a backdoor enabling it to bypass passcodes when the government sent them the phone. That backdoor created major security risks. First, if Apple can break in when they have possession of the phone, then bad people may find a way in when they have possession of the phone, too. But more importantly, if Apple can break in when they have the phone, there may be a way that hackers can exploit that backdoor to break into iPhones remotely. As a result, Apple’s old operating system was dangerous: It was a huge problem waiting to happen. The security risks it raised are great enough that it’s a net public benefit to have the backdoor closed even though it has the unfortunate side-effect of blocking lawful warrants in some cases. Put simply, the computer security gains outweigh the public security losses.
I like this argument. In my initial post, I was assuming that if the government needs to send phones to Apple to break into them, then the passcodes would offer at least some amount of security to its users against thiefs, trespassers, and the like. And even if others can get into the phones, I was thinking, that unauthorized access is going to be quite limited because it requires physical access to the phone. But this may be wrong, it was pointed out to me, and it introduces a cost of Apple’s old approach that I hadn’t appreciated. I still tend see the threat as fairly limited when it requires physical access to the phone. As a practical matter, the requirement of physical access would seem to substantially limit the significance of the vulnerability. But if Apple’s longstanding backdoor works such that the government can’t figure out physical access but hackers can use that backdoor to gain unauthorized remote access, then closing that backdoor adds a security benefit at the same time it imposes the unfortunate cost of thwarting valid warrants.
So where does that bring me? As I see it, it brings me from the “very troubled” category to the “need more information to decide” category. To have a view, I need to know more about the details of the risks on both sides. On one hand, there’s the risk of lost cases; on the other hand, there’s the risk of security vulnerabilities outside the warrant context, and especially remote access crimes. To have a view of which Apple policy is in the public interest, I’d need to know more about how the technical issues play out in both scenarios.
I discussed one side of this in my earlier post: Under the new operating system, just how often will lawful government access to important evidence in a case be thwarted, given the possibility that the government can get the important data via lawful access to unencrypted iCloud backups, guess the passcode, effectuate subpoenas to force decryption, or have other means? The more investigators can use warrants to get the data anyway, the less the new design is an issue. For example, if iPhone users who are the targets of investigations are backing up everything to iCloud, and Apple will hand over that data to the government with a warrant, then the government won’t need to access the physical device and the concern with thwarted warrants isn’t a major one.
Just as I need to get a better sense of the risks to public safety of lost criminal cases under the new operating system, I also need to get a sense of the scope of the security risks under the old approach. In particular, how significant over time is the security risk of maintaining a backdoor intended only for physical access, especially in terms of the risk of remote access? The greater the security risk that was closed with the new operating system, the more the new design is desirable. Putting the two sides together, I can’t really answer what is in the public interest because I don’t yet have a studied sense of how the two risks play out in context. So that brings me from “troubled” to “need more information to decide.”
One minor aside to conclude. Some readers objected to me asking what is in the public interest, raising the libertarian objection that companies owe their duty to shareholders not the public. Even if a company is doing something contrary to the public interest, they noted, it doesn’t mean it should be regulated. My response: Sure, of course. I’m just trying to formulate my opinion of what Apple is doing, and my opinion is based on what I think is in the public interest. If something’s not in the public interest, there’s a separate question of whether the government should respond to it given the risk that the government solution will go astray. That’s a separate question that I haven’t addressed.
Time permitting, I hope to respond to other arguments in later posts, and in particular the argument that the Edward Snowden disclosures show that Apple’s new approach is necessary.

Brent Falls Back Below $98 on Sluggish Demand, Ample Supply
Reuters | Updated On: September 22, 2014 13:34 (IST)
Gold Rebounds on Seasonal Demand; Global Cues
Singapore: Brent crude fell below $98 a barrel on Monday, down for the third session in four, as sluggish demand and ample supplies outweighed a possible cut in oil output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
Comments from OPEC's secretary general last week that the group could cut output next year buoyed Brent on Friday, but investors' attention turned back to the gloomy economic outlook in Europe and China which has curbed oil demand.
A cut in Libya's oil production also had limited impact on prices.
November Brent was trading 57 cents lower at $97.82 a barrel by 0645 GMT after posting its first weekly rise in three last week.
US crude for October delivery fell 60 cents to $91.81 a barrel, ahead of the expiry of the contract at the end of Monday.
"When you look at the increase in supplies in the past year, you see very strong growth in the United States in particular from non-conventional sources and also in other non-OPEC producing areas ... supply growth is not being driven by OPEC," said Phin Ziebell, economist at the National Australia Bank (NAB).
OPEC members, some of whom require oil prices at above $100 to meet budgetary needs, will review the organization's oil output policy at its next meeting on November 27.
Oil production in Libya on the other hand had fallen to 700,000 barrels per day, down nearly 20 per cent from 870,000 bpd a week ago as its El Sharara oilfeld and Zawiya refinery are still closed, said a spokesman for the state-run National Oil Corp (NOC) on Sunday.
But concerns over an extended stagnation in Europe that could pull the other economies down was highlighted at the G20 meeting in Australia on Sunday.
"We expect weak global demand for crude oil to have already been priced in based on the drop in prices we have seen in the past few months. We believe it is very unlikely that prices would increase," Phillip Futures said in a note dated September 22.
Investors will look for cues on where demand from China, the world's second-largest economy, is heading from its flash manufacturing PMI reading due out on Tuesday. Earlier, the world's top energy consumer had reported that this month marked the slowest factory output growth in nearly six years, partly causing Brent to slump under $97, the lowest in more than two years.
"The overall story is of abundant supply and very slack demand being coupled with an increasing lack of nervousness about geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the Ukraine," Ziebell of NAB said.
In signs that western sanctions could impact Russian oil and gas production in the long run, Exxon Mobil said on Friday it would wind down drilling in Russia's Arctic in the face of US sanctions targeting Western cooperation with Moscow's oil sector.
French jets struck a suspected Islamic State target in Iraq for the first time on Friday, expanding a US-led military campaign against militants who have seized a third of the country and also control large parts of neighbouring Syria.
Fighting has also intensified in southern Libya as soldiers and police clashed in the last few days near the country's biggest oilfield El Sharara. The field was shut last week because of damage to a storage facility at the Zawiya refinery in the north, which it feeds.

Samsung earlier this year shelved plans to start selling its Tizen-based Samsung Z phone in Russia during the third quarter. It said it needed to enhance the Tizen "ecosystem" which apparently lacked sufficient developers and apps.
It was not clear if the upcoming Tizen smartphone in India would be the Samsung Z.

Telecom M&A guidelines need to be reworked: TRAI Chairman
Telecom operators have long been demanding changes in the M&A rules, terming them difficult. Vodafone India chief Marten Pieters had earlier said that companies should be allowed to buy assets of a particular firm such as spectrum and not the entire firm which has a lot of debt in its books.

With a view that the country cannot carry on with 12 telecom operators, sectoral regulator Trai today said current merger and acquisition (M&A) rules need to be reworked by the government for any pick up in consolidation activity.
"No jurisdiction in the world has 12 operators, mostly the countries have 5 or 4 telecom players and at some places 2. For this to happen (here) merger and acquisition guidelines have to be reworked," TRAI chairman Rahul Khullar said here. The Chairman of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) said the guidelines have been a non-starter as M&A activity has not taken place despite the industry being in dire need for consolidation.
"I think the industry is in dire need of consolidation, its simply just cannot carry on like this with 10-12 operators, some of them bleeding to death and it has to stop," Khullar said.
Telecom operators have long been demanding changes in the M&A rules, terming them difficult. Vodafone India chief Marten Pieters had earlier said that companies should be allowed to buy assets of a particular firm such as spectrum and not the entire firm which has a lot of debt in its books. Giving an example, Pieters had said, "We love to buy 3G spectrum but for 3G spectrum, if I have to buy complete operator who has 3G spectrum ... It comes with all kinds of stuff I don't want because I have it all. So, it is very difficult to make an attractive proposition in such a situation."
Easing the M&A rules, the government had allowed mergers between firms with up to 50 per cent combined market share. Earlier, telecom firms were allowed to merge if their combined market shares in terms of subscriber base does not exceed 40 percent in any of the nation's 22 circles or zones.

Mumbai needs a directly-elected  empowered & accountable CEO  says Milind Deora(In Maharashtra, the biggest…)
By Milind Deora
Get ready to flash that finger again because election season isn't over yet. But then again, in India, it never really ends. Maharashtra and Haryana go to the polls on October 15 and are confronted with similar electoral dynamics: the widening urban-rural divide, the eternal promise of bijli, sadak and paani. And, of course, a time for those with PhDs in social engineering to present their theses.
In Haryana, for instance, the elections will dictate the National Capital Region's future. In Maharashtra, the biggest impact of the election results will be felt by that old goose who still lays golden eggs: Mumbai.
The Missing CEO
To use an analogy between the workings of corporations and those of governments, the NCR, unlike Mumbai, is a joint venture between the governments of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Mumbai remains, and must continue to remain, 100% owned by Maharashtra. However, it's run by hundreds of VPs, managers and employees who don't report to a boss. Mumbai's shareholders never voted on a resolution to create the post of a CEO. As a result, it still doesn't exist.
Remember civics in school? Well, here's some Civics 101.
Every five years, Mumbai elects six members of Parliament (MPs) to represent it in New Delhi, 36 members of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly (MLAs) and 225 municipal councillors. One of the municipal councillors is appointed Mumbai's mayor, the ceremonial leader of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM, or BMC for those who still prefer to call the goose Bombay). MLAs, usually representing rural Maharashtra, go on to become ministers of departments like home, housing and urban development in the Maharashtra government.
  Too Many Cooks
The net result: MCGM is run by a municipal commissioner (an unelected bureaucrat); Mumbai's law and order, housing and urban planning are overseen by politicians who are seldom elected from Mumbai; the mayor is a ceremonial 'first citizen'; and because of the sheer size of the state, expecting any chief minister of Maharashtra to micromanage Mumbai is like asking Warren Buffett to be hands-on at Coca-Cola.
Also, the agencies that keep Mumbai moving (be warned, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani once groused, "Acronyms are what people in government get in lieu of stock options") — the Traffic Police, MCGM, Mumbai Police, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, the Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority, Railways and Mumbai Port Trust, for instance —work independently of each other with very little inter-agency coordination. They're also housed and compartmentalised under multiple ministries and governments.
It's a classic case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. Which explains why things go horribly wrong when Mumbai is assaulted by nature's fury, terror attacks or, less fatally, by traffic jams and degenerating civic amenities.
What Mumbai needs is greater devolution — not necessarily autonomy — and empowered leadership. We need a directly elected mayor or a CEO (call it what you will). Mumbai needs one elected person to administer and coordinate its affairs and be held accountable after five years.
London's mayors have been directly elected since 2000 and, so far, the results have been encouraging for Londoners. Although London and New York City are shining examples of the efficacy of this model, the good news is that Mumbaikars needn't look too far west for inspiration: north and south of Mumbai, states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu amended their laws to empower their people to elect mayors directly.
Elected Mayor It Is
Rajasthan sent out mixed signals about its tryst with directly-elected mayors. If the mayor of a particular city belongs to a different party than the one controlling its corporation, it naturally causes tensions. Rajasthan's legislators thought this resulted in a deadlock between the city's executive and legislature. But because of its high population density and associated complexities, I believe these tensions are in Mumbai's best interest. The directly-elected mayor is not a perfect system. But in time, as it evolves, it will empower Mumbai to throw up leaders adept at demanding greater attention from the Maharashtra government and New Delhi.
So what's been getting in its way all these years? Regional chauvinism? A dearth of political will? No, it's simply, you and I, the voter. The demand for a directly-elected, empowered and accountable mayor for Mumbai never became an election issue.
Come October 15, let's change that. Mumbaikars could begin by questioning candidates, across political parties, about their desire to see this powerful idea enacted, and then vote accordingly. This system is also in the best interest of MPs, MLAs and municipal councillors, who are often criticised for failing to address issues that are out of their administrative and legislative control.
And can anyone remember who is Mumbai's mayor?

Odisha chit fund scam: Former Odisha Advocate General Ashok Mohanty arrested12
0
Bhubaneswar: The former Odisha Advocate General Ashok Mohanty has been arrested in connection with the Rs 20,000 chit fund scam. Mohanty was first interrogated by the CBI on September 13. He had stepped down from office after the CBI had summoned him in the case earlier this year.
According to sources, he bought a luxurious house in Cuttack at minimum prices from a prime accused in the scam. Sources in the CBI said that he was unable to furnish the documents to prove his claim that he had actually bought the house and it was not gifted by the scam accused.
Names of several BJD leaders including those linked to Odisha Chief Minister have come under the scanner in the chit fund scam that duped over one million people in the state.
According to sources, he bought a luxurious house in Cuttack at minimum prices from a prime accused in the scam.
Fingers are also being pointed towards Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik for allegedly not just protecting the scamsters but promoting them in their illegal business.

Coal scam: Court pulls up CBI for filing vag...CBI
("IO has been warned that…)
NEW DELHI: The CBI today faced the ire of a special court here for filing a "vague" report on a plea for return of passport by an accused in a coal blocks scam case with the judge warning the investigating officer (IO) that cost would be imposed on him in future.
Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar was unhappy with the CBI's compliance report on service of notice to the passport officer, Nagpur, and observed that the document placed in the court was "not proper" and "vague".
"A bare perusal of the entire report and other documents shows that the report is per say vague. It does not say as to whom summons were served and except the word served, there is no other word written on it.
"IO has been warned that in future the report should be in pursuance to rules and procedures of CrPC ," the court said.
The court had earlier issued a notice to the concerned passport officer at Nagpur on a plea filed by accused Manoj Jayaswal, Director of co-accused firm Nagpur-based AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd, seeking return of his passport seized by the CBI during the investigation.
The court's observation came while hearing a case in which Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Darda, his son Devendra Darda, Manoj Jayaswal and the firm were chargesheeted for offences under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) read with 420 (cheating) of the IPC and under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
During the hearing today, the judge was annoyed as to why CBI had not filed a proper compliance report and warned the IO that it would impose cost on him and it will be deducted from his salary.
"It will not work in my court.... You should file a proper report in the court. What prevented you from writing two-three lines properly in the report. I do not care how CBI works. I want the report in the court as per the procedures of law," the judge observed.
The court summoned the concerned regional passport officer in Delhi to appear before it on September 26 to explain status of the matter relating to Jayaswal's passport.
On the last date of hearing, the court had issued notice to the passport officer, Nagpur, after the IO had informed it that Jayaswal's passport had been sent to passport authorities at Nagpur for the purpose of impounding it.
During the hearing today, a clerk posted at the Delhi's passport office appeared before the court and said that the matter relating to Jayaswal's passport has been transferred from Nagpur to here.
"LDC (lower divisional clerk) from passport office, Delhi has appeared in the court. He has been instructed to inform the court that the case pertaining to Manoj Jayaswal has been transferred from Nagpur to Delhi. He has also been instructed to inform that the advocate for passport office is not ready with the case," the court noted in its order.
The court had earlier granted bail to the three accused-- Vijay Darda, Devendra and Jayaswal-- after they had appeared before it in pursuance to the summons issued against them.
Vijay Darda, Devendra, Jayaswal and the firm were named as accused in the charge sheet filed on March 27 in which it was alleged that they had fraudulently acquired coal blocks. They have denied the allegations levelled against them by CBI.
Regarding AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd, CBI had claimed in its FIR that the firm, in its application form for allocation of coal blocks, had "fraudulently" concealed the fact that its group firms had previously been allocated five coal blocks.
Detailing the allocation of coal blocks to AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd, the agency had said the Ministry of Coal invited applications for allocation of coal blocks, including Bander coal block in Maharashtra having geological reserve of 126.105 million metric tonnes (MMT).
CBI had said that the 36th Screening Committee, which was headed by the Coal Secretary, after concluding its deliberations on July 3, 2008, had recommended allocation of Bander coal block jointly to J K Cement Ltd, M/s Century Textiles and Industries Ltd and AMR Iron and Steel Pvt Ltd for their proposed plants in Karnataka and Maharashtra respectively.

Hours after the Union Home Ministry ordered a probe into reports that employees of an Ahmedabad hotel from the northeast were asked to stay away from duty during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent visit, the city police and hotel management have denied issuing any such instruction.
“I am not aware of any such diktat given by police to the hotel authorities about their staff. We were just concerned about the Tibetans,” said Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) A.K. Sharma.
Vikas Sahay, JCP, Special Branch, too said he was not aware of any such order having been issued.
The management of hotel Hyatt Ahmedabad expressed surprise over the reports and claimed all staffers, including those from the northeast, did duty on September 17 when Mr. Xi had a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi there.
“There was no such order given to the hotel staff on that day. All staff, including those from the northeast, was present in the hotel and doing duty when Chinese President arrived. I am surprised as to how such baseless reports are doing the rounds,” said Marketing Manager of Hyatt Ahmedabad Ayesha Mishra.
Earlier, the Home Ministry had asked the Intelligence Bureau to ascertain the veracity of reports about the order and, if it was indeed issued, who did it and why.

New York: House full, that's what you will find out, if you were to make an attempt to book yourself an audience with PM Narendra Modi in New York.
The venue, Madison Square Park, which has hosted some of the biggest global names, politicians, thinkers and musicians will be hosting a total of 18000 people. The organisers say the demand for tickets has been so huge that they have now booked the iconic Times Square screen as well.
Speaking to CNN-IBN, Bharat Barai, chief organiser of the event, said. "Mr Modi is a visionary. And young people want to meet him and hear him."

But everything comes at a price. Organisers say that the cost of this entire exercise is $1.5 million or almost Rs 10 crore in Indian currency. And Modi instructed them not to accept any donations from anyone exceeding $50,000.
An attempt is being made out to convert this into a coming out of sorts parade of the strong Indian diaspora in America. The promos of Modi worked out to send that message. The people are also being asked to share their favourite Modi moments.
So if you are an Indian in the US, a ticket to the speech is what you need to catch up with the visiting Prime Minister up close and in person.

PM Narendra Modi's navratri fast may not allow White House to host him a dinner

Ahmedabad: Speculation is on whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will consume anything except 'nimbu paani' (lemon juice) during his US visit later this week as it coincides with Navratri. For decades now, Modi has been fasting during Navratri.
Will Prime Minister Narendra Modi break his decades-old practice of fasting during Navratri as his visit to the US coincides with his nine-day fasts? Those who know the Prime Minister personally believe he will continue this tradition.
His brother Prahlad Modi also doesn't feel so. Prahlad Modi says that having known the Prime Minister closely, he will not change this practice even this year.
Speculation is on whether PM Modi will consume anything except 'nimbu paani' during his US visit as it coincides with Navratri.
#narendra modi #us visit #barack obama #unga
Prahlad Modi said, "During the Navratri, he consumers only lemon juice. He will not change that. From my experience and knowing his nature, he will not change this habit."
The 65-year old Mahendra Darji and Prime Minister Modi are childhood pals. They lived next door in Vadnagar and went to school together. Both took part in drama together too. Darji says no matter what the occasion is, Modi will never break tradition by consuming food during Navratri.
Mahendra Darji said, "It can never happen. He will never compromise with his Navratri fasts. He has been doing this continuously during navratri for over 35 years now. His book 'Saakshi Bhaav' is also based on reverence to Maa Bhagwati."
Other acquaintances like Jayshree Pandya, who has been tying rakhi on Modi's wrist during Rakhsha Bandhan for the past 12 years, and Rakesh Bhavsar too believe he will continue the practice of fasting during Navratri.
Rakesh Bhavsar said, "During Navratri he gets up at 5 o'clock in the morning and does his fasts punctually. He firmly believes in it."
So, the White House may offer a multi course dinner to Narendra Modi during his maiden visit as the Prime Minister of India. But, he is unlikely to break his Navratri fast and savour the delicacies at the White House, which is known as the power centre of the world.
Anyway, Modi is a strict vegetarian and a teetotaller. The White House will have to wait till the next visit to offer him dhokhla!

Jharkhand governments digital attendance system faces obstaclesPrint
Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Ranchi | Posted: September 22, 2014 5:39 pm
In the near future, when the public witnesses a slice of the impossible – central government employees turning up in time – they will have Jharkhand and a former chief secretary to be thankful for.
However, even as the system seems to have helped the administration take giant strides, it has certain obstacles to cross – all ministers are excluded from it, a cursory survey by this newspaper indicated that most secretary-ranked officers do not use the system, and – at least in Jharkhand – there could be problems scaling up due to trouble with availability and maintenance of hardware.
State government officials say an Aadhaar-based attendance system devised by former CS Ram Sevak Sharma last year and implemented since April 1 this year has improved attendance indicators at the Secretariat in Ranchi.
The Jharkhand model is one of those now being replicated by the Union government and Sharma – now a Secretary at the Department of Electronics and Information Technology in Delhi – is in charge of opening up attendance.gov.in to around one lakh central government employees based in Delhi by the end of September as a pilot.
Sharma is bullish about the scalability and cost effectiveness of his model. “The data cannot be tampered with as servers of the UIDAI are not in the same building…. You can log in using even mobile technology. The scanners cost around Rs. 2,200; the tablets, Rs. 5,000,” he said.
Principal Secretary in Jharkhand’s Department of Personnel Santosh Kumar Satapathy, who is tasked with extending the project down to the block level by the end of the year, says it has reached saturation point in the Secretariat, spread over multiple buildings in Ranchi. As of August 30, 5586 of 5730 registered employees were using the system regularly. “Earlier, people would come late or even the next day and sign in the office register. The effects of the system are obvious five months into its implementation: we have groups of people going into the Project Bhavan [where the CM's office is located] and the like almost around 10 each morning,” said Satapathy.
The website attendance.jharkhand.gov.in is open to public viewing; the attendance of each registered and active employee is viewable in real time, down to their log in and log out times. The idea to link the system to the Aadhaar database was Sharma’s – he was Director General of the UIDAI before his appointment as CS here. At the time of registration and each log in by each employee, the biometric information is verified against those with the UIDAI.
“We have also linked their salaries to this project. If someone comes later than 10.30 am for three days or leaves before 6 pm, an SMS is sent to their mobile informing her or him that an automatic casual leave has been recorded,” said Satapathy, who said “many salaries” have been withheld using the MIS of the website but said the data was not on hand. “When there were allegations that government officials from Bihar were skipping work on Fridays continued…

Sandeep Ray’s Sound of Old Rooms will be screened on September 25
Vikalp Bengaluru, as part of its Doc@Everest series of documentary screenings will show Sandeep Ray’s Sound of Old Rooms on September 25
The documentary by Sandeep Ray (who currently resides in Singapore) has been shot over 20 years in Kolkata.
It traces the life of Sarthak, an Indian man who juggles his desire to be a poet with the practicalities of raising a family. As a college student he had time to drink with friends and discuss his writings; now with work commitments, he struggles to continue his dream. The crumbling home where he was raised and still lives with his nagging but affectionate mother, wife, and young son is extremely cramped; he sleeps, as he has since a child, surrounded by books. Sarthak leads us through Kolkata’s bars, apartments, and alleyways as he tries to understand life and find meaning in his work.
“Even though this film looks back far into the past, I don’t operate out of nostalgia but out of the immediacy of things. If anything the film is nostalgia for the present,” says Ray.
Vikalp Bengaluru is a group of documentary filmmakers in Bangalore who have come together to revive the screening of the best in recent documentary films from India and all over the world and to cultivate a strong, vibrant community of documentary enthusiasts in the city.
The 72-minute film is in Bengali, with English subtitles. The screening is at 7 p.m. at Everest Talkies, Fraser Town. Passes available at the venue before the show.

MHA probes whether Gujarat hotel asked NE staff to stay awayMHA orders probe if Gujarat hotel barred NE staff

The home ministry ordered on Monday a probe into the allegation that employees of northeast origin at an Ahmedabad hotel were asked to stay away during Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent visit to the Gujarat city.
 
Sources said the ministry asked the Intelligence Bureau (IB) to find out the veracity of the order and, if so, who issued it and why.
 
There were also reports that northeast origin employees at a mall in Ahmedabad were asked not to come for duty on the day Xi visited the Gujarat capital last week.
 
The IB has been asked to send its findings by Tuesday after probing the allegations of both the incidents.
 
The sources said that the home ministry ordered the probe taking serious objection to the allegations.
 
Last week, taking umbrage at the reports, Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi had said, "It is an insult to the northeast. They doubted us as if we are not patriots. Are we not citizens of India? This is not good for the region."

Similarly, the business from energy items like crude oil fell by over 64 percent to Rs 5.37 lakh crore from Rs 14.97 lakh crore, while the turnover from base metals like copper dropped by 51 percent to Rs 5.45 lakh crore from Rs 11.10 lakh crore in the review period.
The business from agricultural commodities also declined by over 20 percent to Rs 4.98 lakh crore during the April-August period of this fiscal, as against Rs 6.23 lakh crore in the corresponding period last year.
Experts said the trading volumes have taken a hit since the imposition of the commodity trading tax and the Rs 5,600 crore scam at the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL).
Currently, MCX, NCDEX, NMCE and ACE are operating at national level, while the rest five at regional level.

Three Afghan military officers training in Cape Cod have are missingBy Abby Phillip September 22 Follow @abbydphillip

Three missing Afghanistan National Army officers, who disappeared while participating in a training program in Massachusetts, were detained while attempting to cross the border into Canada and have been transferred to U.S. custody by the Canada Border Services Agency, a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said on Monday.
The men were detained while attempting to enter Canada at Rainbow Bridge, which connects the cities of Niagara Falls in New York and Ontario, said David Procopio, a Massachusetts State Police spokesman.
Procopio said officials with the Massachusetts State Police, which assisted in the search for the three officers, were notified on Monday that the men had been located and would be questioned by U.S. authorities.
The men – Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar — were in the United States to conduct joint military exercises at a base in Cape Cod. They went missing on Saturday during a trip to the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.
Their disappearance marked the second time this month that a group of Afghan trainees had gone missing while participating in programs in the United States.
In the latest incident, the three members of the Afghanistan National Army were reported missing after taking a trip to a shopping mall in Hyannis, according to CNN .
The three men were part of a group of 15 soldiers and officers from Afghanistan participating in annual joint exercises on Otis Air National Guard Base. Along with nearly 200 others from six countries, they were participating in military training exercises with the National Guard, Massachusetts National Guard spokesman James Sahady told the Boston Globe .
Officials said three Afghan National Army soldiers are missing from a joint military training exercise in Cape Cod, Mass. (Reuters)
The program has been held every year since 2004.
The three men who went missing are senior military officers who had been cleared by the State Department to participate in the exercises, Sahady said.
“There is no indication that they pose any threat to the public,” Sahady said, according to the Boston Herald .
This second incident came just days after two Afghan police officers  training with the Drug Enforcement Administration  in Quantico, Va., disappeared while on a tourism day trip to Washington on Sept. 13. The two men, Mohammad Yasin Ataye, 22, and Mohd Naweed Samimi, 24, were found on Sept. 18 in Buffalo, N.Y., where authorities believe they were trying to reunite with family .
DEA spokesman Rusty Payne noted that the men were chosen to participate in the training program because they were among “the best and brightest” in their country, according to CBS , which added:
According to the DEA, each candidate is extensively vetted and polygraphed. Ataye and Samimi entered the U.S. in mid-August with special visas and were participating in the DEA’s Sensitive Investigative Unit Program (SIU) which offers law enforcement agents from 13 countries training in surveillance, undercover operations and intelligence gathering among other things. Classes are taken on field trips on weekends.

Courts and the Judiciary
Uber must face multiple civil counts, a judge ruled Wednesday.
A U.S. judge rejected a bid by the online for-hire car service Uber to dismiss a civil lawsuit that accuses the company of charging customers a 20 percent driver gratuity but pocketing most of the additional revenue instead.
In a ruling late on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco said Uber must face multiple civil counts, including an allegation the company violated California's unfair competition laws.
A company representative could not immediately be reached for comment.

San Francisco-based Uber raised $1.2 billion from mutual funds and other investors in a June funding round, which valued the fast-growing service at $18.2 billion at the time. Uber faces an array of regulatory and legal challenges, however, as it seeks to expand into new markets.
An Uber customer filed a proposed class action lawsuit against the company earlier this year, saying the 20 percent rider gratuity is "false, misleading, and likely to deceive members of the public" because Uber keeps a substantial portion of the money.
Hopefully, the plaintiff's attorneys provide credible evidence to the Judge regarding RICO criminal violations committed daily by Uber.

Tinderella  Is The Modern Age Romance You Can Actually Identify Withreddit
Once upon a time, a New York-based artist swimming in the deep end of online dating started a photo series. In it, she documented her experiences meeting and connecting with men and women, over the course of two months and 17 first dates. She snapped a portrait of each individual -- or, at least, those willing to step in front of her lens -- in a project that eventually became known as "Tinderella."
Could there be a better title for today's modern romance?
Name: Alex, Age: 25, Occupation: Finance, Date: Drinks at The Wayland, Alphabet City
The artist is Australian photographer Kirra Cheers , also known as Tempting Alice . In devising "Tinderella," she approached her work as a means of opening herself up to the possibility of connecting with someone online. Her images were meant to capture not only the person being photographed, but also the dynamic between the artist and her date -- how tired or inebriated they were, what the level of physical and mental attraction was between them.
The result is a collection of casual and honest black-and-white portraits that, when paired with snippets of conversations Cheers conducted over Tinder, reveal a surprising breadth of personality. While 32-year-old Samuel stares irreverently at the camera, with a palpable level of self-confidence, 25-year-old Alex giggles at the viewer, caught in a moment of where-do-I-put-my-hands.
And then there's 34-year-old Jay, represented only by his Tinder "About" section, which reads: "I hope to meet a female who will allow me to buy them thigh high stockings and let me admire your legs."
"I never pressured anyone into having their photo taken," Cheers writes in a statement on her website. "The most common concern was that of being objectified. Most people wanted me to confirm my interest in them as a person and not simply as an art project. In this way, I saw it as a swapping of traditional gender roles –- posing the question that perhaps men and women aren’t all that different?"
We wondered how, as a woman casting a photographer's gaze on multiple men, this sort of conventional gender role reversal felt.
"I found the role reversal to be empowering," Cheers explained to HuffPost. "A mentor suggested that this process of objectifying men was similar to collecting butterflies -- a comparison I greatly enjoy. It is my hope, that people look beyond the initial voyeuristic appeal and see the project as a social commentary on modern romance and how we connect with each other in a digital world."
Empowering and exhausting. "Dealing with my own emotions and the emotions of 17 others in such a short period of time was exhausting," she adds on her website. "At the conclusion of the project, I experienced what I referred to as ‘Tinder Hangover’ and although I believe the app to be a great way to meet people in a modern world where time is such a precious commodity, I am happy to no longer be an active member of the Tinder community.
Head to Cheers' site to learn more about the project (she's included avatars and descriptions of the dates who declined having their portrait taken there).

The Absurdist Soap Opera Inspired By  Our TownPrevious Story

Jayson Musson, Alex Da Corte And Dev Hynes Collaborate On Absurdist Soap Opera Inspired By 'Our Town'
reddit
"Yes, I desire that pink sphere" a young woman says, in French, pointing to a pink globe amongst shelves stacked with oranges and orange soda. A man in all black retrieves the sphere, asking "This one?" He's wearing stilts, a hairnet and pale greenish face paint.
"Yes, that is the one," the woman responds, placing it into her orange purse. It perfectly matches the surrounding soda and fruits. She then grabs a neon green Swiffer which she refers to as a "spear." Shortly thereafter, a man with green hair skateboards through the set.
This is " Easternsports ," the contemporary art world's absurdist take on a soap opera.
The in-the-round video installation is a collaboration between Jayson Musson , known primarily for his Coogi sweater-inspired paintings and his YouTube alter-ego Hennessy Youngman , and Alex Da Corte , known for his electric environments that explore the objects consumerism leaves behind. For this piece, however, the two Philadelphia-raised artists ventured into more unknown terrain, Musson creating the text for the piece and Da Corte working with video.
"Easternsports" is loosely based on Thornton Wilder's 1938 play "Our Town," which tells the fictional tale of two small town Americans growing up and falling in love. The vignette-heavy telenovela revamp infuses Wilder's original with colorful influences ranging from Don Quixote to Ja Rule to David Lynch. The unearthly sets are full of sharp angles, acidic colors and everyday objects in alien scenarios. Just watching the preview feels like visiting the 99 Cent Store in a sugar-induced dream.
The piece's title, "Easternsports," references a poem Musson created in his early twenties, commenting on the Western relationship to Buddhism as something to be tinkered with. " It's a comment on the notion that, as Westerners, our identities are not fixed, " he explained to Paper Magazine. "From our position of privilege we're able to explore or dabble with cultural exports from other parts of the world, religion being one of them. Westerners are encouraged to 'find themselves' and in that process we try on, then discard many ideologies, thus reducing them to trite intellectual garments, or a light pastime much akin to sports."
The piece, which was scored by Blood Orange's Dev Hynes, recently opened at the Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania . We reached out to Musson and Da Corte to learn more about their technicolored visions and pop culture inspirations.
When I think of "Our Town" the first thing that comes to mind is the minimalist (basically non-existent) set. Is the visual overload of "Easternsports" reacting to that minimalism?
Alex Da Corte: When I first designed the sets for "Easternsports," I was thinking of Thorton Wilder’s desire to create characters that were aware of their own theatricality -- mini versions of Don Quixote who live in their imagination when the world doesn’t deliver what one needs. So the sets, became stilts or ladders for these characters to achieve what they need. For Thorton, the characters' desires were simple and the props needed to perform them, the same. In "Easternsports," each set is a stage for one or multiple individuals to fully support and produce a ritual of their liking that allows them to perform their desired lifestyle to the fullest. If these stages are seen as overload (even though I sort of disagree), the maximal set reveals the complicated systems of support we construct to perform these ideologies on the daily.
Jayson, you mentioned the origins of the title "Easternsports" in an interview with Paper . On that note, is learning the new shopping? If so, would that be better or worse? 
Jayson Musson: Shopping, i.e. acquisition, is definitely a form of learning, but in terms of it replacing traditional learning, which is what I think you mean, I’d have to say ‘nah’. Because if that was the case, those who possess the most would be the most learned. And rich people are generally dumb. If anything, shopping begets more shopping, possessions demand companion possessions, and surrounded by all these items, a certain emptiness sets in. But I do like shopping though. My Amazon Prime game tight.
How did you settle on soap opera as a medium? It's such a traditionally emotional and lowbrow art form that feels totally alien to the cool and critical norm of video installations. And how does the multilingual aspect factor in?
ADC: For starters, soap operas always remind me of laundry detergent -- I guess because I used to watch them when I stayed home from school while my mother folded laundry. Originally, my interest in soap operas grew from their flatness, due to the melodrama and the stage design common in cheap television production. In one of the first soap operas, "Painted Dreams," produced a few years before "Our Town," the focus was concentrated and humble -- their goal was to paint a portrait of a family, and the complicated systems contained within one. Similarly, "Easternsports" paints a picture of a family, the family of my dreams.
I am not concerned with “cool or critical norms of video installations” as a gauge for choosing to make what I want to make. This show grew out of a strange, funny and constant dialogue between Jayson and myself, about the world, our families, and our friends and that, to me, is very cool. I grew up in a bilingual home watching most of my television shows in Spanish, some of which were telenovelas. As I recall, there was a heightened sense of viewing when I couldn’t completely understand all of the language.  With Jayson supplying the 12,000 word script, it made sense to employ this Brechtianesque technique in order to highlight Jayson’s use of language as a guide for the visuals.
JM: The multilingual aspect of the project, which there is actually very little off, stems out of a notion of performance. As a writer as well as ex-dabbler of performance art, the multilingual element of "Easternsports" was to exist as a way for me to transpose my voice and occupy a space other than the one I currently fill as myself Dr. Male HeteroNormativeCisGenderedFella. Like a reverse Donelle Woolford of sorts; like “Can this wily negro possess the authority to put words into the mouth of white woman?” But like I said, there’s not much of it now, we wanted the viewer’s internal voice to take primacy over the voice of the possible various narrators.
Alex you mentioned that Dev Hynes is also a synesthese. Do either you or Jayson experience synesthesia?
ADC: Yes he is. Did I mention he is also a fucking wizard? I am most definitely tone deaf but I do love colors and music very much. Jayson is also tone deaf, I think. Have you heard him sing? As far as what synestheses see and hear, I couldn’t really say. Dev explained to me that the ways in which the score was composed follows the rhythm of the colors as they enter and exit the screen. I make most of these videos as moving paintings, and think of them in terms of music regarding pacing and crescendos, so it was really magical to see Dev make those actions come to life with his music.
If my high school memory serves me correctly I'd say "Our Town" centers around family, love, faith and death. What four key words would you use for "Easternsports?"
ADC: Family, Love, Life, Death.
JM: I would like to replace family with ‘Oranges.’
What in the piece was inspired by Ja Rule?
JM: At the end of Scene 1 there is a narrative passage about a special land populated by the heroes and icons of yesteryear. Ja Rule makes an appearance playing an N64 on a beach by himself. The faded rapper and the faded gaming system are pretty apt metaphors for the inevitable place our culture’s most celebrated entities end up: put through the grinder and mashed to dust.
Is there anything that strikes you as distinctly Philadelphia in the work?
JM: It’s funny, last night me and Alex went to dinner and afterward on the drive back to the apartment I crash at when I’m in Philly, I told Alex of this time I was walking on Ridge Ave at 4 a.m. with my friend Kurt way back when we were both toy ass graffiti writers in the early aughts. Anyway, as we walked up Ridge Ave, these four kids who couldn’t have been any older than 10 years old come scurrying out of an alley about a block up from us. The kids ran to a stoop that faced the alley they just exited and they all watched the alley with a lot of excitement and interest. As Kurt and I approached the entrance of the alley we finally saw what they were so excited about; a car was on fire in the alley, presumably lit by them, and they were just sitting on this stoop enjoying their craftsmanship. I’d like to think of "Easternsports" as me and Alex’s burning car in Philadelphia. Set on fire with much love and curiosity.
Last question: What are the strangest rituals that make up your daily life or identity?
JM: Hmm, probably that every morning I wake up, look at my naked body in my bedroom mirror and think to myself: “Your profanity knows no end.”
ADC: I have to agree with Jayson.
"Easternsports" runs until December 28 at the Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania. See a preview of the piece below.

Alibaba leaps 38% in huge IPO debutBoom: Alibaba surges 38% in huge IPO debut
By Matt Egan   @mattmegan5 September 19, 2014: 4:21 PM ET
 
This is how a stock is born
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Alibaba, the biggest IPO to ever hit Wall Street, made a huge splash when it started trading Friday.
Shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant closed at $93.89, marking a 38% pop from the $68 price of its record-shattering initial public offering.
The bounce signals optimism among investors about Alibaba's ( BABA ) ability to continue its rapid growth trajectory as China's middle class grows and and the company expands to other parts of the world.
Moments after the stock started trading, the co-founder and CEO of the company, Jack Ma, told CNNMoney he's "honored" and "humbled."
Ma told CNBC that years from now he wants Alibaba to be compared with American icons like Wal-Mart ( WMT ), Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) and IBM ( IBM , Tech30 ). People will say Alibaba "changed the world," he said.
Related: Everything you need to know about Alibaba
Alibaba opened at $92.70 and then raced to nearly $100 before sinking back below the IPO price for a few hours. The initial trading day for any stock is almost always volatile, but Alibaba's will be seen as a win.
Unlike the disastrous 2012 Facebook ( FB , Tech30 )IPO on Nasdaq, Alibaba's first few hours as a public company went smoothly. That's good news for the New York Stock Exchange, where Alibaba chose to list its high-profile IPO under the ticker symbol "BABA."
Alibaba raised $21.8 billion late Thursday. That's the largest ever IPO for a company listed on an American exchange.
It might turn out to be the biggest IPO in the world. Goldman Sach ( GS )and the other investment banks that made the IPO happen have the option to purchase additional shares. If those options are exercised as expected, the Alibaba deal would raise $25 billion -- a global record.
Alibaba is cashing in on a very bullish overall atmosphere for stocks. The Dow and S&P 500 set new all-time records this week.
Don't worry if you've never heard of Alibaba. You haven't been living under a rock.
The Chinese company, which was founded in 1999 by former English teacher Ma, has yet to make its presence felt in the U.S. But the truckload of new cash raised by the IPO should change that.
Alibaba has largely focused on the exploding Chinese Internet market, which has already made the company a dominant player in e-commerce.
Related: Alibaba IPO means a big payday for Jack Ma
Investors are so excited about the company becasue roughly $248 billion of merchandise exchanged hands on Alibaba's platforms in 2013, according to IDC. That trumps the gross merchandise volume of Amazon.com ( AMZN , Tech30 ), eBay ( EBAY , Tech30 ), JD.com ( JD ) and Japan's Rakuten ( RKUNF ) -- combined.
Thanks to those impressive figures, Alibaba starts life with some elite company you've definitely heard of. At the $68 IPO price, Alibaba was valued at $168 billion. That's more than Amazon.com.
After the first day of trading, Alibaba now has an even more impressive valuation of $231 billion, which is greater than Facebook and more than halfway to catching Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ).
Many investors like to consider the price-to-earnings ratio as a way to gauge how expensive a stock is. Based on its earnings for the year ended March 31, Alibaba is trading at a very lofty price-to-earnings multiple of 61.
Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald launched coverage of Alibaba on Friday with a "buy" rating, although they have a price target of $90, which has already been surpassed.
"We believe that a differentiated pricing model, strong brand and unmatched scale give Alibaba an unfair competitive advantage," Cantor analyst Youssef Squali wrote in a note.
Retail investors are showing some serious interest in Alibaba. TD Ameritrade ( AMTD ) said Alibaba orders were on track to represent 15% of daily average revenue trades at the brokerage. By comparison, Facebook represented 22% of trades on its IPO day and Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) was about 5%.
Yahoo ( YHOO , Tech30 ) investors are also cheering because the U.S. Internet company is cashing in a chunk of its investment in Alibaba. After taxes, Yahoo is poised to make around $5.1 billion by selling about 122 million Alibaba shares. Yahoo is holding onto a major stake that translates to billions more in value.

Bubble in everything, everywhere: Marc Faber

Even after the Dow and the S&P 500 closed at new all-time highs, closely followed contrarian Marc Faber keeps sounding the alarm.
"We have a bubble in everything, everywhere," the publisher of The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. Faber has long argued that the Federal Reserve's massive asset purchasing programs and near-zero interest rates have inflated stock prices.
The catalyst for a market decline, as he sees it, could be a "raise in interest rates, not engineered by the Fed," referring an increase in bond yields.

Faber also expressed concern about American consumers. "Their cost of living have gone up more than the salary increases, so they're getting squeezed. So that's why retailing is not doing particularly well."
A real black swan event, he argued, would be a global recession. "The big surprise will be that the global economy slows down and goes into recession. And that will shock markets."
If economies around the world can't recovery with the Fed and other central banks pumping easy money into the system, that would send a dire message, Faber added. He believes the best way for world economies to recover is to cut the size of government.

There's a dual-economy in the US and around the world with the rich doing really well and others struggling, he said. "[But] the rich will get creamed one day, especially in Europe, on wealth taxes."
On the other end of the market spectrum, longtime stock market bull Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Tuesday (ahead of Wednesday's Fed policy statement leaving interest rate guidance unchanged) that he stands by his Dow 18,000 prediction.
The Wharton School professor sees second half economic growth of 3-4 percent, S&P 500 earnings near USD 120, and the start of Fed rate hikes in the spring or summer of 2015.

NEW DELHI: ISRO's Mars Orbiter or Mission (MoM) on Monday successfully completed the fourth trajectory correction manoeuvre and test fire of the main liquid engine on the spacecraft.
"Main Liquid Engine test firing on Mars orbiter spacecraft successful: We had perfect burn for 4 seconds as programmed. The trajectory has been corrected. Mars Orbiter Mission will now go ahead with the normal plan for Mars Orbit Insertion," said ISRO. "#MarsOrbiter Main Liquid Engine test firing successful!," tweeted ISRO.
This was one of the biggest tests of this complicated project. The test entailed switching on the engine that has been lying dormant for 10 months, and firing it for four seconds to slow down the spacecraft.
Now, the ISRO will fire the engine for a longer duration two days later and ease the spacecraft into an orbit around Mars. The 440N liquid engine was last fired on December 1 to slingshot the spacecraft from an Earth orbit to the Martian trajectory. The spacecraft authorization committee earlier this month decided to carry out the four-second test to ensure that the long duration of idling hasn't affected the engine that carries corrosive fuel.

India is set to make history, thanks to its maiden Mars Orbiter Mission! After being launched from ISRO's spaceport of Sriharikota on November 5 last year, the MOM had left Earth's orbit on December 1 and began its historic voyage to put India on the list of elite nations, which has sent a mission to Mars.
Cruising towards its historic rendezvous with the red planet, the MoM is scheduled for Orbit Insertion on September 24.
Earlier today, the MoM entered the Mars Gravitational Sphere of Influence. The Mars mission, as planned by ISRO, was a sophisticated exercise. Compared to other Mars missions, ISRO had a smaller rocket and payload. This reduced the cost significantly but increased the mission's complexity. Other Mars missions are not planned this way.

Incessant rains since Saturday has submerged most parts of Guwahati, while three persons have been killed, one each due to drowning, landslide and electrocution. As normal life was thrown out of gear, the government closed down schools and colleges, and SDRF personnel deployed to shift residents from the worst-affected localities.

While most low-lying localities were under waist-deep water, flash floods caused by rain-water coming down from the adjoining Meghalaya hills have inundated new areas in the Assam capital. While poor and inadequate drainage has remained a bane for Guwahati, the Assam government had blamed rampant destruction of hills in adjoining Meghalaya for adding to the city’s woes.
Public transport and all vehicular movement came to a standstill as the major arterial roads like GS Road, RG Barua Road, Dinesh Goswami Road, GN Bardoloi Road, Maniram Dewan Road and Panjabari Road remained submerged since last evening.

In Goalpara and Dhubri districts, the government deployed BSF personnel to rescue hundreds of villagers marooned due to floods. In South Salmara sub-division of Dhubri district, about 5,000 people have been marooned. Teams of the NDRF and SDRF have been also deployed in the two districts, official sources said.
While the Brahmaputra has been flowing abve the red mark for the past two days, the water-level in several other major tributaries has also risen in the past three days. In Guwahat city, the Bharalu and Bahini, two rivers that flow through the city, were overflowing, especially as the Brahmaputra was flowing above the danger level.

Leading British Medical Journal refuses to retract open letter on Gaza written by authors concerned that Jews control the media  politics and bankingBy David Bernstein September 22
The Lancet is a venerable and well-respected British medical journal.  In August, it published an “open letter for the people of Gaza,” which harshly condemned Israel.  Nothing terribly novel there, as both The Lancet and its rival, the British Medical Journal, have over the years published a series of tendentious attacks on Israel thinly disguised as reports on Palestinian health–judging from British medical journals, Palestinians’ health status is more important than everyone else in the world’s, combined. (UPDATE: I should note, though, that this particular letter barely even pretends to be on a medical subject, it’s almost pure political rant.)
What is new is that the  Telegraph  reports that two of the five authors of the open letter, Dr Swee Ang, an orthopedic surgeon, and Dr Manduca, a professor of genetics at the University of Genoa in Italy, sent emails to their contacts endorsing a raving anti-Semitic video from David Duke entitled “CNN, Goldman Sachs & the Zio Matrix.” Dr Ang wrote: “This is a shocking video please watch. This is not about Palestine – it is about all of us!” Dr. Manduca, meanwhile, also “forwarded a message alleging that the Boston marathon bombings were in fact carried out by Jews.”
When contacted by the Telegraph, Dr. Ang said: “I didn’t know who David Duke was, or that he was connected to the Ku Klux Klan. I am concerned that if there is any truth in the video, that Jews control the media, politics and banking, what on earth is going on? I was worried.”
That’s more than Dr. Manduca could muster. She issued a statement denying being anti-Semitic, but apparently not distancing herself from the content of the video, instead stating that she was exercising her “right of freedom of opinion,” and to reiterate that she “does not agree or value the politics of the government of Israel, nor of many others, including Jews in and out of Israel.”
Is the Lancet the least bit embarrassed to have published the letter? Nope. “It’s utterly irrelevant. It’s a smear campaign,” the editor of the Lancet, Dr Richard Horton, told the Daily Telegraph. “I don’t honestly see what all this has to do with the Gaza letter. I have no plans to retract the letter, and I would not retract the letter even if it was found to be substantiated.”
UPDATE: NGO Monitor has documented Manduca’s nutty worldview , of which anti-Semitic conspiracy theories are only a start.
Contrary to what I wrote in the update earlier, the letter was published as “Correspondence,” not as a peer-reviewed article.
And commenter Loki wishes I had subsumed this post into a broader post, with the following structure (with some minor editing of the original):
A. Under leadership of Richard Horton, the Lancet has been gradually lowering their levels of scholarship for political reasons. This has resulted in terrible scandals.  See, for example, Wakefield on autism.
B. Part of the partisanship has been increased coverage of Middle East conflicts, which have little to do with medicine.
C. These articles have been repeatedly criticized as being little more than propaganda; however, regardless of the merits, it is certain that they have little to do with medicine.
D. Together, we have a picture of an editor who is using a respected scientific journal to push a political point of view.
E. Recently, the Lancet published an “open letter” that purported to make many factual claims about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and advanced yet another political position.
F. Unsurprisingly, it has come out that two of the signatories to the open letter, and, in fact, two of the five authors, have been forwarding anti-Semitic videos, making the Lancet a forum for racist kooks to spout off about politics.
G. The editor of the Lancet needs to resign.
I think there are two scandals here.  One is that the Lancet allows itself to be prostituted to political causes that are not essentially “medical” in nature.  The second scandal is that Dr. Horton appears to be not the least bit embarrassed that he is publishing work by racists attacking a country run by the group in question. Because Jews.

Villagers in Latehar district claim harassment by forest departmentTwo of the Latehar district harassment victims Bhikan Singh (Left) and Amrica Bhueya (Right) explaining the trouble caused by the forest department officials. (Source: Express photo by Manas Chaudhary)
Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Latehar | Posted: September 22, 2014 5:12 pm
About 100 people in four villages of Latehar district allege that the forest department is harassing them by filing frivolous cases, claiming some officials are working on the behest of local strongmen. All the villagers are from the Kope, Jerua, Jagthu and Lanka villages of Manika block.
The Indian Express has seen the details of 93 individuals, against whom at least 38 cases have been filed between 2007 and 2010. Most have multiple cases against them; they have been to jail for short periods. In all, the FD alleges they encroached upon nearly 600 acres of land. Apart from encroachment, people have been charged with stone mining and tree felling. The villagers deny all charges.
One of the 93 even alleges that he was jailed for 11 days even though the arrest warrant was in the name of someone who doesn’t exist. “The police came to my house asking for Korhi Bhuiyan, son of Tiru Bhuiyan. Tiru was my father’s brother but he died a few years back and had no children of his own,” said Amrika Bhuiyan of Jerua. Amrika produces notices from the FD and summons from a Latehar court he received in the name of the non-existent Korhi, accusing him of encroaching on four acres of forest land. “I never took those notices seriously. I kept telling the policemen that I am not Korhi, but they would not listen to me,” said Amrika, who is a Dalit and has Aadhaar, BPL, MNREGA and voters’ identity cards. All of the accused are adivasis, Dalits or Muslims.
The irony in the case is that the FD is now doing to these villagers what the Maoists did in 2011. In February 2011, the Maoists beat to death Jerua resident Niyamat Ansari, accusing him of helping villagers encroach on forest land. “The same contractors who encouraged the Maoists to go after Niyamat and me are now getting Forest officials to trouble us,” said Bhukan Singh, who used to work with Ansari on MNREGA and who was also a target for Maoists. Villagers say there is a caste divide to the antagonism – upper castes who have secured MNREGA contracts have been opposed to their claim to more pay.
There are 11 active cases against Bhukan now – Niyamat too, had been an accused in all of them at the time of his death. In all, the FD alleges he is part of encroachments amounting to 129 acres. “Tired with all of us shuttling between our village and the courts, I once told policemen to just jail us all for once. They laughed and said there continued…

After China  GSK faces pressure for changeAfter China, GlaxoSmithKline faces pressure for change
By Reuters | 22 Sep, 2014, 05.13PM IST
While the European healthcare sector has been a roll so far this year, rising more than 20 percent on optimism over new drugs, GSK shares have lost 10 percent.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: GlaxoSmithKline may have closed one chapter in a saga of corruption allegations by accepting a $489 million fine in China, but the drugmaker has its work cut out to win back sceptical investors.
That means continued pressure on Chief Executive Andrew Witty, seen not so long ago as one of the sector's star managers, who is under fire for allowing the erosion of GSK's all-important U.S. business just as much as for the woes in China.
"I think GSK is a buy when the CEO of that business goes," said John Bennett, a director of European equities at Henderson Global Investors, which has a holding in the drugmaker.
Other disgruntled shareholders believe an accelerated change of chairman would be an important signal that the company is acting to address their concerns and working to improve financial returns.
The current chairman, one-time Vodafone chief Chris Gent , is due to step down by the end of 2015 but some argue the handover should now be brought forward.
"A new chairman must be overdue. Someone needs to look at the strategic direction of the business with a fresh pair of eyes," said one top-50 shareholder.
Commenting on plans to find a successor, a GSK spokesman said: "Succession planning for the chairman is well under way."
Replacing the chairman early rather than ditching CEO Witty, who has been in the job since 2008, is seen as a potential compromise to reassure disenchanted investors.
SHARES PRICE SAGS
The root of investor unhappiness is not hard to find. While the European healthcare sector has been a roll so far this year, rising more than 20 percent on optimism over new drugs, GSK shares have lost 10 percent as forecasts for its sales and earnings have fallen.
GSK unveiled a far-reaching asset swap deal with Novartis
in April that will refocus its business by building up its strengths in vaccines and consumer health, in exchange for exiting the hot area of cancer medicine.
In the long term, that transaction should deliver sustainable growth from more stable and lower-risk businesses.
But the Novartis deal will not close until next year and will take time to bed down -- and even when it does, the new-look GSK is still likely to grow below its peers, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, who believe further meaningful change is needed.
"A new chairman could potentially kick-start this change process," they wrote in a note on Monday, while upgrading the stock to "buy" from "neutral" on hopes for an overhaul. "We believe that status-quo at GSK is unlikely to continue for long."
Potential actions by GSK to address poor investor returns could include further cost-cutting and allocating more capital to acquisitions of promising new drugs, rather than buying back shares. A longer-term option might be to sell off the vaccines or consumer health operations to unlock value.

Punjab National Bank approves 1:5 share splitEmployees Stock Purchase Scheme
(State-owned Punjab National…)
MUMBAI: Punjab National Bank (PNB) has said its plans to split its stock in ratio of 1:5 which would mean that the face value of its shares would be Rs 2 as against Rs 10 now making it more affordable to retail investors. The board of government owned bank also approved plans to raise equities either by way of private placement to institutional investors or through a follow-on issue or through a rights issue.
This will make PNB first government owned bank to announce a stock split. Among private banks, ICICI Bank had recently announced five for one stock split while other banks like HDFC Bank has split its stock in ratio of five for one and Kotak Mahindra Bank is two for one.
The board of PNB has also approved allotment shares to employees under employees stock purchase scheme (ESPS) or any other similar scheme. State Bank of India is the only other government owned banks to have offered its employees ESPS. In May 2014, SBI raised over Rs 800 crore by offering shares to employees at Rs 1565 per share.
The board of PNB has approved plans to raise Basel III compliant Tier-I Capital bonds. The shares of PNB closed at Rs 985, up 92% over previous closed at the Bombay Stock Exchange. All the board approvals are subject to a nod from Reserve Bank of India and government of India, the bank said ain a notice to the exchange.

Chit fund scam: Ex-Odisha advocate general heldThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday arrested Odisha’s former advocate general Ashok Mohanty from his residence in Cuttack for his alleged involvement in the multi-crore chit fund scam by state-based Artha Tatva (AT) group.
 
“My conscience is clear and I have not done anything wrong. Truth will prevail,” Mohanty told reporters after his arrest.
 
No CBI officer was available for comment.
 
Mohanty’s arrest is a huge embarrassment for Odisha government.
 
On September 13 – a day after the state government accepted his resignation – Mohanty was interrogated for about three hours by the CBI about his alleged links with AT group chief Pradip Sethy, who is now in jail.
 
Mohanty had bought a house in Cuttack from Sethy in February last year at a cost of more than Rs. 1 crore. The purchase was made at a time when there was an operative warrant against Sethy and he had moved the court for an anticipatory bail. The bail was eventually denied.
 
Sources said Mohanty could not provide a satisfactory explanation about the transaction to the CBI during his interrogation.
 
The CBI has so far arrested eight persons including Mohanty, three media barons, a real estate broker and a Mumbai-based stock exchange broker.
 
The alleged chit fund scam in Odisha is said to be worth thousands of crores of rupees. It came to light two years ago after depositors complained that several chit fund companies swindled them of their hard earned money after promising high return on their deposits.
 
The Odisha government had ordered a probe into the scam by the state police.
In May this year, the Supreme Court ordered the CBI to probe the scam. The CBI has registered 44 cases against chit fund companies in Odisha.
 
The central investigation agency has also registered four cases against such companies including Saradha Group in West Bengal.

Neoliberalism  and other words that purport to a describe an intellectual movement no one belongs toBy David Bernstein September 22
Neoliberalism is one of those words that when I see it used, I know that the author is hostile to the concept he purports to be describing.  I’ve been hanging around in classical liberal/libertarian/free market circles for almost thirty years, and I’ve yet to here a single compatriot refer to himself as a “neoliberal,” or to his philosophy as “neoliberalism.”  Yet, socialists of all parties attack the other side as neoliberals, which, given that there aren’t any self-described neoliberals, means that they can put basically whatever content they want into the term, and purport to be attacking “neoliberalism.”
My question is whether we can think of other descriptive terms like this.  One that comes to mind is the purported “Constitution in Exile movement,” which existed only in the minds of those opposed to it, as Orin and I documented several times on this blog.
Others?

ISIS jihadists urge killing of citizens from US-led coalitionThe Islamic State group called on Muslims to kill citizens of all countries taking part in the US-led anti-jihadist coalition by any available means, in a statement posted online Monday.
   
"If you can kill a disbelieving American or European — especially the spiteful and filthy French — or an Australian, or a Canadian or any other disbeliever... including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him," said Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the group's spokesperson.
   
"Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military," he said in the message, which was released in multiple languages.
   
The United States and France are carrying out air strikes against IS targets across Iraq and seeking to build an international coalition against a group increasingly perceived as a global threat.
   
US secretary of state John Kerry said that more than 50 countries have come forward with commitments as part of the coalition, including Egypt and other Arab states.
   
The jihadist group, which has declared a "caliphate" straddling Iraq and Syria, controls swathes of territory in both countries.
   
IS has executed hundreds of Iraqis and Syrians, as well as foreign hostages, and its brutal campaign has forced more than a million people from their homes.
   
Adnani's message — which was released in an Arabic audio recording and transcripts in other languages including English — gave instructions on how the killings could be carried out without military equipment, using rocks or knives, or by running people over.
   
'A new era'
   
The hundreds of foreigners from various Western countries fighting alongside IS have sparked fears that they could return home to carry out attacks.
   
On Monday, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned that any of its citizens "who fight with terrorist groups... will be arrested, prosecuted and jailed for a very long time."
   
Adnani praised militants in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, calling on them to "cut the throats" of those fighting for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and saying Tunisians should follow their example.
   
He criticised Yemen for allowing Shiite Huthi rebels to enter the capital Sanaa, asking: "Is there not in Yemen a person who will take revenge for us (on) the Huthis?"
   
And he called on Muslims in Libya to unite, saying that "your division is from Satan."
   
"We are in a new era, an era where the (Islamic) State, its soldiers, and its sons are leaders, not slaves," Adnani said.
   
"We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted."
   
He also mocked the US air campaign, saying that "the battle cannot be decided from the air".
   
"Are America and all its allies from amongst the crusaders and atheists unable to come down to the ground?"
   
Addressing US President Barack Obama, Adnani said: "You claimed... that America would not be drawn to a war on the ground. No, it will be drawn and dragged. It will come down to the ground and it will be led to its death, grave, and destruction."

CAG begins performance audit of fuel linkages for IPPsCAG begins performance audit of fuel linkages for IPPs
BS Reporter | Bhubaneswar Sep 22, 2014 08:29 PM IST
The office of the Comptroller & Auditor General of India (CAG) has initiated the process of performance audit on ‘Fuel Linkages to Independent Power producers (IPPs)’.
The performance audit will cover a period of five years from 2009-10 to 2013-14. The audit work is being taken up by H R Biswal, senior audit officer at the office of the Accountant General, Bhubaneswar. The scope, coverage, audit objectives, criteria and tentative time schedule will be discussed in an entry conference with the state officials scheduled on September 27.
“Necessary instructions may be issued to the concerned officers of your department and PSUs like Gridco and Odisha Power Transmission Corporation Ltd (OPTCL) to provide records such as registers, files and annual reports as and when requisitioned and to extend full cooperation to the audit team for smooth conduct of the performance audit. I would also request you to furnish replies to all the preliminary observations issued during the audit at the earliest so that the department's views on the points raised can be considered while finalising the report”, Sunil S Dadhe, principal accountant general (economic & revenue sector audit) wrote to Suresh C Mohapatra, principal secretary (energy), Odisha.
The state government has signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) with 28 IPPs, envisaging a total generation capacity of 37,510 Mw with the state share being 5,887 Mw.
Till date, three IPPs have commissioned thermal power capacity of 4,050 Mw, the state being entitled to a share of 947 Mw power from these commissioned units. The proponents to have put their units on stream include Vedanta Group firm Sesa Sterlite (2,400 Mw) at Bhurkamunda nea Jharsuguda, GMR Kamalanga (1,050 Mw) at Kamalanga near Dhenkanal and Jindal India Thermal Power Ltd (600 Mw) at Dernag near Angul. JITPL is likely to commission another 600 Mw unit by the end of 2015. By that period, three more IPPs are expected to commission their projects- Ind Barath Energy (Utkal) Ltd (700 Mw), Monnet Power (1,050 Mw) and Maa Durga (60 Mw).
Coal blocks have been allocated to 10 IPPs while 10 others have obtained coal linkages. But none of the coal blocks allocated to the power producers has been able to commence mining due to delay in obtaining the necessary clearances.

Train staff to control disruptive behaviour  DGCA tells airlinesAirlines asked to train crew to deal with unruly flyers
BS Reporter | Mumbai Sep 23, 2014 12:44 AM IST
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) wants airlines crew to be adequately trained to prevent any disruptive behaviour by passengers on ground as well as onboard. In its draft regulations, the DGCA has said the training should enable crew to detect, defuse and handle critical situations.
The regulator also wants airlines to develop standard operating procedures for dealing with disruptive passengers and include a statutory warning in the ‘conditions of carriage’ printed on tickets, specifying the acts that would be considered unlawful.
“Airlines shall establish a mechanism to detect and report unruly passenger behaviour at check-in, in the lounges, and at the boarding gate in order to prevent such passengers from boarding. In case of occurrence of an act of unruly behaviour while the aircraft is on the ground, such cases shall be reported immediately in writing and First Information Report lodged with the security agency at the aerodrome for assistance,” the DGCA's draft regulations said. Notably, it added the disruptive behaviour could also be the result of unsatisfactory service. In such cases, the staff should be able to spot early signs and handle the situation soon enough, so that the situation doesn’t escalate.
The regulation does not mandate the procedures that crew should follow to control disruptive passengers. However, airlines in India allow crew to use seat belts or carry nylon handcuffs to tie disruptive passengers, should the situation so demand.
While foreign airlines blacklist disruptive passengers from future travel by creating a no-fly list, Indian airlines do not.
In May, SpiceJet's chief operating officer Sanjiv Kapoor had said this on Twitter, "Abusive pax (passenger). Ground staff, cabin crew in India take a lot of abuse. It needs to stop." He also tweeted this: "This kind of behaviour would land the abusive pax behind bars in many other parts of the world. You cannot abuse crew ever! It is shocking."
Banned behaviour !
* Endangering the safety of an aircraft and persons therein
* Drunk behaviour in aircraft
Failure to obey commands of aircraft commander

Why Innovators Hate MBAsBut business school may not be worth it.
Photo by Iindranil Mukherjee/AFP/Getty Images
This article originally appeared in Inc .
If you want to be an innovator or an entrepreneur, should you go to business school? At first glance, maybe not: Peter Thiel once said "never ever hire an MBA; they will ruin your company." Meanwhile, Scott Cook, founder and leader of Intuit, recently told me, "When MBAs come to us we have to fundamentally retrain them—nothing they learned will help them succeed at innovation." Perhaps a stronger indictment comes from Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, SpaceX, Solar City and PayPal, who said, "As much as possible, avoid hiring MBAs. MBA programs don't teach people how to create companies ... our position is that we hire someone in spite of an MBA, not because of one."

While we generally recognize that management training has value, why do leaders of innovative companies offer such harsh criticisms?
I would argue that the fault doesn't lie in the person but in the purpose of management itself. Business schools teach management principles that were developed in the later industrial revolution to solve the large-company management problem—not the innovation problem. As the industrial revolution transformed the economic landscape, replacing small workshops with large companies, the "new giants" created demand for management to make the trains run on time. Business schools followed close behind, with tools to train managers on how to coordinate and control these growing industry titans. However, while these more familiar management practices work well for relatively familiar problems, such as how to optimize activities and coordinate execution, increasing evidence suggests these techniques work poorly for managing the comparative uncertainty of bringing a new idea to market. In other words, business schools have focused on how to capture value from customers, not how to create value.
Another way to think about it would be examine the traditional S-curve that describes the life of a product or company (see Figure 1):
Early in the life of a company, during the startup phase, uncertainty is high and the entrepreneur is forced to wear a dozen hats to create value. Core tasks include search and discovery in an effort to create a customer. But once that uncertainty begins to resolve, the core tasks shift to execution and optimization in order to capture value. The founders are often kicked out of the company during this shift, and MBAs take the reigns to scale up the company.
When we talk about conditions of high uncertainty, we need what we might call an innovation school, rather than a business school, approach. An innovation school deals with the emerging science of managing uncertainty. Figure 2 shows the differences between these two schools of thought:
To provide an example of how these schools differentiate, consider the following: In business school (B-school), when you study marketing, you typically learn the importance of building and protecting your brand or doing quantitative analysis to identify customer segments and get customer feedback. In an innovation school (I-school), however, you should initially ignore your brand and obtain all customer feedback through direct interaction, whether by experience, observation, or interviews. What's more, rather than emphasize building brands by satisfying a broad range of customers through perfected products, I-school emphasizes the need to test low-fidelity prototypes with small groups of customers, embracing errors as opportunities to learn.
Further illustrating this point, in B-school, when you learn finance, you're taught about marginal cost logic: the importance of leveraging prior fixed-cost investments with new initiatives. But this approach biases you toward incremental innovation efforts. In I-school, you learn how to look for opportunities to build something disruptive, something that hasn't been built before, to deliver a unique solution. In a world of uncertainty, leveraging investments can often be a bad practice because it may lead to building a workaround solution instead of one that nails the job to be done.

I'm not saying that one approach is good and the other is bad. Both are good. The key to success is to recognize when to apply a more familiar B-school approach and when to apply I-school thinking—a decision that rests primarily on the degree of uncertainty. In other words, when uncertainty is high, apply an I-school approach. When the uncertainty has been resolved, use a B-school approach. Fortunately business schools are starting to adopt these ideas, but we are in the midst of a transition. The real question is, how do you manage uncertainty? Are you applying the right process?

10 Game-Changing Ideas on Entrepreneurship from Peter Thielreddit
"What great business is nobody building?" is the question Peter Thiel, celebrity investor and veteran entrepreneur, asks entrepreneurs every day.
The brilliant PayPal cofounder, Facebook investor, creator of the Thiel Fellowship , and general partner of Founders Fund recently spoke at Columbia University on his book Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future . The book, released Tuesday, shares his perspective of the future and the modern technological landscape. His first tip involved "learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places."
Thiel's talk heavily focused on the concept of zero-to-one innovations -- revolutionary inventions like the first airplane or home computer, which require "intensive, vertical, zero-to-one progress" -- and how to get there.
Here are 10 key takeaways from Thiel's talk and his book so you can start dreaming up the next big thing:
1. Question what you think you know about the past. To understand businesses and startups today, you have to do the truly contrarian thing: you have to think for yourself.
2. The usual narrative is that capitalism and perfect competition are synonymous. A better one frames capitalism and perfect competition as opposites: capitalism is about the accumulation of capital, whereas the world of perfect competition is one in which you can't make any money.
3. To build your company culture, it may be helpful to dichotomize two extreme personality types: nerds and athletes. Neither extreme is optimal. A company made up of nothing but athletes will be biased towards competing, while a company made up of nothing but nerds will ignore the fact that there may be situations where you have to fight. You have to strike the right balance.
4. Avoid being blinded by entrepreneurial optimism. The default thinking is seductive, but too simplistic: you've created something wonderful, venture capitalists (VCs) like to invest in wonderful things, and therefore VCs will be desperate to invest in your wonderful thing. That's wrong. VCs, as we've seen, have their own biases and motivations. The question is simply how you can exploit them to your mutual advantage.
5. Inspiration isn't all that counts. Dispel the belief that the best product always wins. There is a rich history of instances where the best product did not, in fact, win. An incredible product doesn't necessarily mean success -- but it might get you half way there.
6. Every company is different. But there are certain rules that you simply must follow when you start a business. A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed. If you focus on the founding and get it right, you have a better chance at success.
7. For a company to own its market, it must have some combination of brand, scale cost advantages, network effects, or proprietary technology. Of these elements, brand is probably the hardest to pin down. The best kind of business is one where you can tell a compelling story about the future. The stories will all be different, but they take the same form: find a small target market, become the best in the world at serving it, take over immediately adjacent markets, widen the aperture of what you're doing, and capture more and more.
8. As a society, we now gravitate towards explaining things by chance and luck rather than skill and calculation. The internal narrative is that talented people got together, worked hard, and made things work. The external narrative chalks things up to right place, right time. But it's not all a matter of luck. And the part of it that is can be channeled and mastered.
9. No one knows for sure when the future will arrive. But that's no reason not to think about the question. It's easy to point to past predictions where people envisioned a very different future from the one they got. Knowing how and why things didn't quite unfold as people thought is important. You have to know how people in your shoes got it wrong if you hope to get it right.
10. Progress comes in two flavors: horizontal/extensive and vertical/intensive. Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that work. Vertical or intensive progress, by contrast, means doing new things. The single word for this is "technology." Intensive progress involves going from zero to one.
His closing left us with some Thielspiration in the form of making the distinction between mysteries and secrets: "You have mysteries no one has a clue about, and there are secrets you could figure out. The truth seems to be the people that believe in secrets will find them. People that believe that they are all solved will not even try. Go against the conventional wisdom that everything has already been discovered."

Fight against Ebola is grossly underfundedThe fight against Ebola is grossly underfunded
By Patrick Gillespie   @CNNMoney September 20, 2014: 8:35 AM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The Ebola virus has already killed thousands in West Africa, an immeasurable loss for many families. As medical workers try to quell its spread, global organizations are calculating the economic impact of the disease.
"Their economies are basically being devastated," said Daniel Epstein, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization. "Economic activity has halted in many areas there. The harvest isn't going on. People can't fly in and fly out."
WHO workers even had difficulty flying into the Ebola -stricken nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, Epstein said.

Over 2,600 people have died, according to the latest WHO count. If Ebola is not contained this year, the cost could increase by eight times its current estimate, according to a report published Wednesday by the World Bank Group. Ebola's toll in Liberia alone could affect almost 5% of the country's GDP this year, the World Bank said.
"Our findings make clear that the sooner we get an adequate containment response and decrease the level of fear and uncertainty, the faster we can blunt Ebola's economic impact," said World Bank president Jim Yong Kim in a statement.
Related: History of Ebola outbreaks
In need of aid: The United Nations said this week that $1 billion in aid is needed to contain the Ebola outbreak. But a UN database tally of donations shows that many wealthy Western nations that verbally pledged support have donated paltry sums to fight the disease.
Total donations, including non-binding pledges, to fight Ebola are about $388 million, well under half of the United Nation's estimate, according to data from Financial Tracking Service, a database that tracks humanitarian aid and is managed by the United Nations. The Obama administration announced this week that it hopes to send an additional $500 million in humanitarian aid to the West African nations this fiscal year.
Even with the U.S. government's significant aid proposal, the total number would still fall short of the United Nations' estimate of a billion.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon went as far as saying "our best estimate is that we need a 20-fold increase in assistance" at a meeting this week.
Related: Despite Ebola, CEOs bullish on parts of Africa
Some private foundations have also stepped in. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated over $8 million so far to various organizations to fight Ebola. That is more than the combined donations of Canada, Germany and Spain, according to FTS data.
Overall, the Gates Foundation has pledged $38 million, which eclipses many more countries.
Epstein noted that countries such as Canada contribute to the aid effort in non-monetary ways by sending aid workers and conducting medical research.
"We're also at the stage where people are seeing what the landscape is and figuring out, what's the best way to donate funds?" Epstein said. "In a humanitarian crisis, there are often delays between what people realize what they have to do and what they actually do."

Airlines Oppose Government Policy on Connectivity to Remote Areas
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 21, 2014 16:22 (IST)
Sebi Bars Transgene Chief, 5 Officials From Capital Markets
New Delhi: Airlines and private charter operators have opposed the government's draft policy on air connectivity to regional and remote areas, saying it will have severe impact on their financial strength.
Almost all major airlines including the proposed Tata-SIA carrier Vistara and business jet operators have submitted their opinions to the Civil Aviation Ministry over the past few days opposing various provisions of the draft policy and called for further deliberations.
To discuss the policy and other issues like high taxation on jet fuel with top airline officials, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju has convened a meeting here next week, official sources said.
The revised draft policy on air connectivity to regional and remote areas was made public last month by the ministry, which proposed a major shift in the route dispersal guidelines and promised several incentives and exemption from various charges to airlines which fly to such unconnected places.
Terming the state governments as major stakeholders in improving air connectivity in the hinterland, the policy asks them to take financial measures like slashing VAT on jet fuel and underwriting of some seats to encourage aviation growth.
It also suggests that the state governments should waive electricity and municipal charges like house and property taxes for five years for airport infrastructure.
The draft proposes increase in the number of trunk routes from the current 12 to 30 and identifies 87 regional "incentive destinations". It makes it mandatory for scheduled airlines to mount capacity "which is at least equal to the capacity deployed on trunk routes" by October 2015.
In its submission, private airline Jet Airways said the policy requirement to deploy 100 per cent of trunk route capacity on regional routes could cause overcapacity and hence this should be should be reduced to 50 per cent.

CHICAGO — Mike Hiner used to take his grandsons to McDonald's when they wanted a treat. With higher wage and food costs pushing up prices at the Golden Arches, he's increasingly taking them to IHOP, Denny's and Chili's instead.
"Those meals are the same price," said Hiner, a 58-year- old geologist in Houston. "And they're better."
McDonald's Corp. on Thursday announced a 5 percent increase in its quarterly dividend, raising the payout by the same rate that it did last year. ( Jessica Wohl )
The loss of bargain-seeking customers like Hiner underscores a growing challenge for McDonald's Corp.: While the company still offers several items for $1, its menu is quietly getting more expensive. McDonald's said its prices were up about 3 percent through the end of June compared with 12 months earlier. That's more than the 2.5 percent gain in prices for food Americans purchased away from their homes in the year through August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The chain's diminishing appeal among budget diners — coupled with rising meat costs — are projected to take a bite out of third-quarter earnings due to be reported Tuesday. Analysts estimate that McDonald's revenue fell 1.8 percent to $7.2 billion in the period. Net income, which also were hurt by a food-safety scare in China, slid 11 percent to $1.36 billion, according to the projections.
Lisa McComb, a spokeswoman for the Oak Brook, Illinois- based company, declined to comment.
McDonald's famous Dollar Menu now includes items that cost more than $1, and other items are creeping above $5. At some McDonald's locations in Chicago's Loop, a Double Quarter Pounder with cheese, fries and a drink totals about $7.50. Chicken Club sandwiches are $4.45, $4.99 and $5.19 at different Chicago McDonald's restaurants, without sides or a beverage.
McDonald's hasn't offered enough discounts and deals to attract diners, which contributed to its four straight months of U.S. same-store sales declines, UBS AG said in a study this month.
Some Americans are extremely price sensitive, and any increases may send them elsewhere, said John Gordon, principal at San Diego-based Pacific Management Consulting Group, an adviser to restaurants and franchisees.
"If you encourage and kind of seed the notion that you can come in for a couple bucks and get some food — and then you can't do that anymore — there's bound to be a reaction," he said.
Restaurants are being pressured into boosting prices because of rising beef, cheese and pork prices, as well as minimum-wage increases. Minnesota, California and Michigan have recently hiked minimum pay levels.
U.S. restaurants plan to boost prices 2 percent during the next six months, more than the 1.7 percent average increase from the prior 12 months, according to an October survey by restaurant researcher MillerPulse in Atlanta.
Build Your Own Burger is a test roll out of McD's answer to the $15 minimum wage.

The dry-roasting process may trigger peanut allergies  a new Oxford study saysBy Sarah Larimer September 21 Follow @slarimer
Texas feed-store owner Jerry Foote holds a handful of peanuts grown in Gaines County. (Brad Farris/The Avalanche-Journal file via Associated Press)
Peanut allergies are extremely common — and can be extremely dangerous. For some people who suffer from peanut allergies, exposure to the nuts could even  be life-threatening .
That means that if you suffer from the allergy, peanut butter sandwiches are out. You can't snack on apple slices with Jif. You can't even eat any food that's been processed with peanuts; sometimes, just a tiny amount of the stuff is enough to cause a severe reaction.
But there's hope! Researchers in Britain believe they have determined a possible trigger for the allergy, according to an Oxford University study set to be published this week.
The new study, which will be published Monday in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology , determined that dry-roasted peanuts were more likely to cause an allergic reaction in mice than their raw counterparts.
Researchers found that dry-roasting the peanuts caused chemical changes, because of the high temperatures that the roasting process requires. Their research suggested that a person's immune system could pick up on those changes, "priming" them for an allergic response, according to a news release.
That might help explain why more people suffer from peanut allergies in Western countries, where dry roasting is more common, than in East Asia, where, the news release noted, "peanuts are more often eaten raw, boiled or fried."
"People with higher allergic background often have genetic dispositions to various types of allergies including to peanuts," Oxford researcher Amin Moghaddam said in an e-mail. "But as [we] and others have argued, dramatic recent rises in peanut allergy and the geographical discrepancies cannot simply be attributed to a genetic background."
Here's how the study worked: Two groups of mice were exposed to either dry-roasted or raw peanuts through a few different methods.
Some mice had purified peanut proteins injected under the skin, others had the proteins applied to skin lesions, and others had it introduced only through gastro-intestinal routes. The researchers later measured the responses the mice had to additional exposure.
"The results of all methods unanimously demonstrated a robust higher allergenicity for dry roasted peanut proteins," Moghaddam wrote in his e-mail to The Post.
What comes next? Figuring out how relevant this finding is to human allergies and trying to clarify how the chemical changes that happen during the roasting process trigger the reactions, Moghaddam said.
We specifically asked about peanut butter, because well … come on, who wouldn't ask about peanut butter?
"Peanut butter is a popular product and is mainly made of dry roasted peanuts," Moghaddam wrote. "We are currently investigating methods that could be food industry friendly and that can be used to eliminate potential harmful chemical changes.
"If the relevance of dry roasting to human allergy is established and the harmful chemicals are confirmed, their prevention or elimination could potentially make such products safer."
Quentin Sattentau of Oxford's Sir William Dunn School of Pathology cautioned in a statement that the research "is at an early stage and we think that it would be premature to avoid roasted peanuts and their products until further work has been carried out to confirm this result."
James R. Baker Jr. , the interim chief executive of the national nonprofit Food Allergy Research & Education, said in a statement Sunday that peanut allergy "is an extremely important problem" and that "the results concerning dry roasted peanuts are interesting and provocative, and deserve confirmation in humans."
Patrick Archer, the president of the American Peanut Council, said he hadn't had a chance to read and review the Oxford study and therefore couldn't comment directly on its findings. But, Archer said through a spokeswoman Sunday, the peanut industry trade association "supports any research that sheds light on the underlying causes or a cure that helps individuals with allergies."
The study was funded by the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre , the Swiss National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health in the United States, according to the news release.

Sridharan tours Vijayawada for metro rail feasibilitySridharan tours Vijayawada for metro rail feasibility
V.Rishi Kumar
Metro rail projects advisor E. Sreedharan and his team at VGTM-UDA going for a site visit in Vijayawada on Saturday.
Hyderabad, Sept 20:  
Metro rail expert E.Sreedharan today toured the Vijayawada city to initiate studies on the potential for metro rail project in the proposed new capital for Andhra Pradesh.
The Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu had earlier appointed him to take up feasibility study and suggest ways to develop metro rail projects in Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam cities.
On his maiden visit to study the feasibility, he said that it would take few months to come up with concrete proposals.
He plans to visit Visakahpatnam after about 10 days to assess the ground situation.
Renowned engineer was associated with several metro rail projects, the Konkan Railways project and later with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation in its design and execution and also management. He also assisted the unified Andhra Pradesh in the feasibility work and alignment for the Hyderabad metro rail project.
He suggested that the project could be taken up in 26 km on two corridors in phase one.
Sreedharan felt that it would be appropriate for the Government to take up the project rather than any other mode and indicated it might require about Rs 7,500 crore as per early estimates. Detailed project report would be ready by January 2015.
He said that it was not necessary to link Guntur. At a later stage the newly developed area could be connected.

Hong Kong: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's initial public offering now ranks as the world's biggest in history at $25 billion, after the e-commerce giant and some of its shareholders sold additional shares.
Overwhelming demand saw the IPO initially raise $21.8 billion and then send Alibaba's stock surging 38 percent in its debut on Friday. That prompted underwriters to exercise an option to sell an additional 48 million shares, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said.
The IPO surpassed the previous global record set by Agricultural Bank of China Ltd in 2010 when the bank raised $22.1 billion.
Under the option, Alibaba agreed to sell 26.1 million additional shares and Yahoo Inc 18.3 million, netting the two companies an extra $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion respectively.
Alibaba's Jack Ma agreed to sell an extra 2.7 million shares and company co-founder Joe Tsai agreed to sell 902,782 additional shares, according to the prospectus.
The source declined to be identified as the details of the additional sale have yet to be made official. Alibaba declined to comment.
Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley acted as joint bookrunners of the IPO.
Rothschild was hired as Alibaba's independent financial advisor on the deal.

Expect another 10-15% returns till next Budget: Kotak08:00 am
Sandeep Bhatia, Executive Director and Head of Sales at Kotak Institutional Equities believes that markets are currently “in sideways to slightly down” phase. Though he does not see any major uncertainties in the near term, he feels upcoming by-polls in Maharashtra and Haryana, may have some impact.
“Market has lot of expectations. It expects everything to be aligned very quickly. So, if this political news is not in pink of health then the market can definitely get nervous,” he said.
Bhatia said the government is not looking at making any major changes in reforms, and sees higher energy prices as only possible risk for the market.
Kotak Institutional Equities in its India strategy note has said that it does not expect Indian markets to deliver meaningful returns over the next 4-6 months. It says that if the market was to go up further without any meaningful changes to earnings, it would use the opportunity to ‘sell’.
Bhatia expects another 10-15 percent returns in the market till next Budget, but feels the strong fund flows will continue. He believes the economy is on an upturn and sees Diwali to be great from consumer spending angle.
Kotak Institutional Equities has introduced Marico  in its portfolio with a weightage of 200 bps. Discussing the company, Bhatia said that it one of the better managed consumer stocks and there’s no big pressure seen on raw material costs. Besides, existing business of Marico is seeing an upturn and its valuations are relatively inexpensive compared with peers.
Kotak also likes  Maruti , Tata Motors  within auto space and Info Edge , Just Dial  from the Internet segment.
Below is the transcript of Sandeep Bhatia’s interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: It is a confused market out here. We have run hard; it is the eighth consecutive series when the contract will end higher than the previous month. Is it legitimate to believe that you could see one or two contracts of lower finishes?
A: I think it is legitimate to believe that we are in a sideways to slightly down market. I don’t think there are any big domestic uncertainties right now on the economy front. We are going into the Maharashtra elections, we are going into Haryana elections so there is some political big events coming around there and if those elections don’t go well for the ruling party then there would be some kind of messages which will be read. 
I would be very careful to derive any quick conclusions out of any political elections going in the next two months. However, the market may still want to take some conclusions. Market has a lot of expectations, market expects everything to be aligned very quickly, so, if this political news which is not in the pink of health kind of situation, the market can get nervous.
Latha: That would perhaps be a day’s jitter or two. After all, every election as one of the political commentators was telling us cannot be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister. He has a definite five year mandate. So, maybe there will be a day or two of flutters. I am more worried about the government’s performance itself. It is now about four months old, do you think that at some point in time investors will believe that actual action on the ground is not coming? Broad noises about USD 20-35 billion investment over 5-10 years are not enough to keep the fire going. Do you think that worry on performance will be there at some point? 
A: If you say that let us not talk in generality, let us not talk about the five year investment horizon, let us not talk about the fact that we will definitely see high investments, if we still have to talk in specific events, the only big event that I would look out for is the curtailment of energy subsidies and announcement of a higher gas price. 
Is there any big bang other reform other than energy prices that we are expecting in the near term by the end of this year? I would say no. So, if I see gas prices go up from the current levels, maybe not the levels which every private sector industry wants them to be at but if we see an improvement that is something which would be a positive for the markets and in my books it would definitely be a positive. 
That is the way I see it. I don’t think this government right now is looking at making any other big changes other than maybe energy prices in November and December.
Sonia: What kind of returns do you think this market can deliver in the 6-12 months? Do you think it could be paltry compared to what we have seen up until now this year?
A: If this market has to deliver another 35-40 percent returns then there has to be most importantly another gush of cash which has to flow in. I think cash is coming in, in the market and will continue to come in till February and March. So, I would be betting on 15 percent kind of returns till the next Budget and not the kind of returns that we have seen on the first half of this fiscal year. 
So, let us not go by the March to September kind of returns. That would probably be expecting a lot of this market but this market will still end up looking very good on a 12 months basis and would still prospectively look very interesting. That is the way I would like to put it rather than say that it should do 30 percent and up every six months; that I don’t think is a fair assessment.
Latha: Over the last week we have seen foreign institutional investors (FII) flows peter out, couple of days of minor selling; not a whole lot but the buying has stopped. Is that a spot of bother that FIIs have allowed outperformance this far but won’t allow any further? 
A: Two things were happening the last fortnight if I would say. One is the fact that there were jitters around the Scotland referendum. The expected decision was a no to independence and if that has been an adverse outcome on that expectation, then there would be bigger jitters in the markets right now. So, we have gone pass this.
We had jitters in the last fortnight around that. The second thing which the markets have still to get their head around is who will increase first, whether UK will increase rates first or the US will increase rates first, what will be quantity if at all in the near term. I think there were jitters in the last fortnight around that. 
I think we have some clarity on some of these fronts right now, there are no big immediate hikes being planned. So, I think flows will continue to come to India and India finally has to be driven by its domestic savings. India’s investment cycle has to be driven primarily by its domestic savings and investment. I think this Diwali is going to be a great Diwali. I see already indications coming across in terms of spending coming through in cars. I think consumers on durables and mobiles and so on; it is going to be one of the better Diwalis then we have seen in recent past. 
The economy is on an up turn so this is something which will filter through in terms of bottomline. I don’t expect any big negative surprises coming through in the October- November reporting season. 
Sonia: I was going through your model portfolio and you have made some changes there. You have introduced Marico into your model portfolio with a weight of 200 basis points. Just tell us about that stock in particular and also what you see as the trend in consumption now? 
A: As far as Marico is concerned, it is one of the better managed consumer stock. Its valuations are more palatable to our valuation driven model portfolio building thesis that we have where we are very disciplined on valuations. So, Marico fits that, not only that its existing businesses is see up turn, there is no big pressure coming though on raw material cost and the new business are also scaling up very well which is why we have introduced Marico. 
It is also a good midcap name which this market will definitely be going towards midcap in the second lag of this rally in the next 6-12 months. We have seen the big caps outperform and now as the economy continues to gather steam, the midcaps always do better which is why Marico is introduced.

Uddhav stops at 119; BJP mulls contesting all 288
After Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s tough talk in Mumbai, the BJP’s central election committee met on Sunday and discussed its candidates for all 288 Assembly seats in Maharashtra, but withheld announcing the names as last-ditch efforts were under way to salvage the alliance.
The meeting was held under a shadow of uncertainty over the status of the alliance, particularly after Mr. Thackeray publicly made a “final offer” of 119 seats to the BJP for the October 15 election.
Rejecting the Sena’s offer, the BJP told its old alliance partner that it was the duty of both to continue the tie-up and sort out issues between them directly instead of going through the media.
Despite the apparent tough posturing by the BJP, sources said “all options are open.” “The BJP is keen that the alliance continues,” a source said.
Earlier in Mumbai, the Shiv Sena made it clear that it would leave no more than 119 seats for the BJP. “We will contest 151 seats and will forgo 18 from our quota for the four other allies. But this is my last effort to save the alliance,” said Mr. Thackeray while addressing party office-bearers in Mumbai. Mr. Thackeray reminded Mr. Modi that Sena supremo the late Bal Thackeray had backed him after the Gujarat riots. In it is hidden the demand that Mr. Modi should return the favour and back him as the alliance’s chief ministerial candidate.
‘We are givers and not takers’
For the Maharashtra Assembly election, the Shiva Sena is insisting that the BJP contest the same number of seats — 119 — as it did in 2009. The BJP has been demanding an equal share of the total 288 on the back of its better performance in the Lok Sabha election.
“I told the BJP leaders that we are givers and we are not takers. We are giving our seats to other parties,” Mr. Thackeray said.
Opening up for the first time in two weeks, Mr. Thackeray said the BJP had sought 145 seats initially. “The proposal was not even worth considering,” he said.

Falling crude prices helps India control fiscal deficit

Falling crude prices helps India control fiscal deficit
Moody's last week lowered the price assumptions it uses for rating purposes on Brent crude oil to USD 90 per barrel through 2015, which represents a USD 5 drop from its previous assumptions for 2015.

The finance ministry is increasingly optimistic that it can meet a tough fiscal deficit target, helped by a 12 percent decline in global crude oil prices since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took charge in May.
Lower crude prices mean less government outlay for India, which imports 80 percent of its oil needs - at a cost of USD 168 billion last year - and subsidizes oil products such as diesel and fertilizer.
"If crude prices remain below USD 100 a barrel compared with budgeted estimate of USD 105-USD 110 a barrel, total oil and fertiliser subsidies would be substantially lower ," said a senior finance ministry official, with the direct knowledge of the matter.
Moody's last week lowered the price assumptions it uses for rating purposes on Brent crude oil to USD 90 per barrel through 2015, which represents a USD 5 drop from its previous assumptions for 2015.
Finance Ministry and Reserve Bank of India officials are due to meet on Friday to decide how much the government will need to borrow from the markets in the second half of the 2014/15.
The government borrowed Rs 160 billion less than it budgeted in the first half of the financial year, triggering market speculation that the fiscal deficit could end up even lower than the target of 4.1 percent of GDP.
"As of now, the deficit target remains 4.1 percent," said a finance ministry official, who declined to be named since he was not authorized to speak to the media.
The country's top finance ministry official, Arvind Mayaram, suggested at the weekend that the deficit target could be met without the harsh expenditure cuts that have kept the deficit in check in the past two financial years.
"You cannot have three years of continuous expenditure cuts," Mayaram told the Economic Times newspaper in Cairns, Australia, where he attended the G20 meeting. Many economists say the cuts have slowed economic growth.
He said if GDP growth keeps to the pace of the first quarter and remains at 5.6 percent to 5.7 percent in the second half, government borrowing could be lower than budgeted, but said it was too early to take such a decision.
A sustained rally in India's stock markets - the Nifty has risen more than 25 percent this year - is adding to optimism in the finance ministry that revenue from the partial privatization of state-run companies such as ONGC and Coal India will beat the budget.
RBI governor Raghuram Rajan delivered more good news in the form of a cash dividend of 520 billion rupees from foreign exchange trading operations, about 50 billion rupees higher than expected.
But not all is well. Tax collections have been lower than targeted so far this year - thanks to a muted economic recovery and a drought in some parts of the country that has hurt corporate earnings.
Revenues from indirect taxes - mainly comprising customs, service and factory gate taxes - rose just 4.6 percent during April-August period, far lower than annual target of 20 percent.

How gifted and talented programs are failing our kidsThere's no one size fits all. (Reuters/Max Rossi)

Jenn Choi
September 22, 2014
Take a minute and think about the most talented colleague at your office—not the most popular, not the nicest, but rather the smartest person who comes up with those unforgettable, out-of-the-box solutions. He’s that person you seek when you need a real expert.
Is this person also a bit “rough around the edges”? Do you feel she or he could be “really great someday” if he could just learn to… (fill in the blank)? And yet this individual has a job because everyone knows he or she has an indispensable gift.
Most everyone has someone like this at their office. It’s inevitable. But when you go to a classroom full of children, even a classroom of so-called “gifted” children, there might be that one highly gifted child who is just like your colleague, except for one big difference: This gifted individual is still a child and, thus, his quirkiness or even downright bad behavior need not be tolerated. Today, children who are similar to that highly talented colleague of yours are at risk of not receiving an appropriate education that matches their intelligence. Not only would their talents be squandered but also the social and emotional skills delays may cause them to be isolated and fall through the cracks.
Aidan, now a fourth grader in New York City, is one such child. He taught himself to read before ever stepping into a classroom. By second grade, he was able to read at a fifth grade level and was working on middle school math problems. IQ assessments that his parents had done privately showed him to score at 99.6% on almost every section of these tests.
  Aidan is the quintessential twice exceptional kid (2e).  
You would think that, as a resident of New York City, Aidan would be attending one of the highly sought after schools for gifted and talented students such as NEST+M or the Anderson School —but that’s not where you’ll find him. He actually never completed the qualifying exam for the city’s Gifted and Talented program that he was supposed to take before kindergarten because he simply walked out midway during the exam. “He just didn’t want to be away from me too long,” Aidan’s mother told Quartz. (Aidan is a pseudonym used to protect the child’s identity.)
His mother sent Aidan to a charter school where things started out well. In kindergarten, Aidan was given extra assignments whenever he finished his work early and was even given a special space with art supplies when he needed to take a break from the everyday noise and activity that sometimes overwhelmed him. However, his first grade teacher did not understand why Aidan would not follow along like everyone else and even said that she didn’t think Aidan was a particularly accelerated learner. This worrisome predicament caused Aidan’s parents to have him take the Gifted and Talented exam again. He scored in the 98th percentile and began attending a regular public school, which had a special classroom for students his age who’d also scored highly on the exam. Thus, as a class, they would be learning at a faster pace than in general education classrooms.
Aidan’s mother hoped her son would fare better in a class for similarly talented children. But the truth was that Aidan’s social skills weren’t nearly as good as his academic prowess. He didn’t always know how to engage his classmates, and sensory issues made it difficult to deal with noise, making activities such as gym, lunch, and recess a nightmare instead of a welcome reprieve from the classroom. Aidan ended up becoming bullied by other students, misunderstood by teachers, and perhaps worst of all, he wasn’t learning much at school.
The highly-abled can be disabled too
When the bullying became physical halfway into the school year, he completely lost interest in learning. Aidan’s parents were not blind to his lagging social skills. Before the 2012-13 school year began, they had requested an evaluation for an individualized education plan (IEP), which is given to students as a result of the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). While Aidan is highly gifted, he also has social and emotional skills deficits that hinder his ability to learn in a regular classroom.
Aidan is the quintessential twice exceptional kid (2e), which is more commonly known in the gifted community as “twice-exceptional” when a child who is gifted also has special needs which can include learning disabilities, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety to name a few. Sometimes with 2e kids their disabilities hide their giftedness. Likewise, their giftedness hides their disabilities as many naturally try to overcompensate.
 A privately-hired psychologist suggested to Aidan’s mother that she pull her son out of school to prevent any more damage.  
Many people who work in education understand that these individualized plans would only be provided to children with a learning disability or a physical disability but this not always the case. US law requires that every child receive a “free and appropriate education.” Placing Aidan in a class, gifted or not, without any accommodations for his special needs could not be deemed as appropriate. It is times like this when you can imagine what it might be like for that special co-worker of yours with his quirky ways, his brusque nature, having to do overly simple work alongside many other co-workers doing the same task. It’s an impossible scenario for such professionals in any industry. Likewise, for these young students with even less social know-how to guide them, these scenarios are even more unrealistic.
But where do students like Aidan go when the city’s only gifted and talented system is unable to provide them with an appropriate education? Aidan’s parents had worked hard with the public school all year long to come up with ways to alleviate the situation, even though their original requests for an evaluation were brushed off by the school psychologist. It became clear that the school couldn’t or didn’t know how to make adjustments so that Aidan could make real academic progress.
In May, toward the end of Aidan’s horrible year as a second-grader, a privately-hired psychologist suggested to Aidan’s mother that she pull her son out of school to prevent any more damage. “He was crying every day on the way to school, sobbing, begging not to make him get out of the car,” she said. A former teacher herself, Aidan’s mother made the difficult decision to homeschool him for the few remaining weeks of the school year.
By then, the city’s department of education was willing to provide Aidan with special education services, since his parents had spent thousands of dollars on testing and were able to uncover deficits, based on a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder made by a neuropsychologist at the NYU Child Study Center . Still, the city could not come up with a placement for Aidan for the rest of his second grade year nor for the current school year. Had the whole process of evaluating Aidan for more support taken place when his parents wanted to pursue it back in the beginning of the school year, he might have had more options. But now he had missed admission application deadlines for the very few schools that fit his profile as some states (including New York) pay the tuition for children to attend private school when an appropriate placement in a public education setting cannot be found. During those last weeks that Aidan was home, the city sent a teacher for a total of six hours of home instruction in the six weeks he had left of the school year.
While there is not yet much concrete data showing just how many 2e students like Aidan exist, many professionals that work with the gifted community will tell you that this kind of twice-exceptionality exists in many gifted children and adults. In fact, some researchers in gifted education are attempting to redefine giftedness as a condition of asynchronous development where an individual develops skills unevenly to the extent that the higher the intelligence, the more likely he or she will experience problems of a social nature; the gap between the strengths and weaknesses could be quite large.
 “Identification of these students will need to emphasize aptitude rather than relying only on demonstrated achievement.” 
One of the leaders in the study of twice-exceptional students is psychologist James T. Webb, a former dean and professor of psychology at Wright University and the founder of   Social Emotional Needs of the Gifted , a 30 year-old not-for-profit organization dedicated to bringing attention to the unique emotional needs of gifted children and adults. Webb has heard countless stories like Aidan’s and currently works as a publisher of books about the gifted at Great Potential Press . Using just a few words, he captured the heart of the issue: “It’s widely known that judgment lags behind intellect.” Even if Aidan didn’t have a learning disability of an academic nature, his neurologically-based disability still prevented him from learning in a classroom without special accommodations. “When we talk about wisdom, what we’re talking about is someone who is right but also has judgment,” he told Quartz, citing wisdom as something that can’t necessarily be reasoned out. “What’s the logic behind not asking someone how much they weigh?”
In fact, the National Association of Gifted Children released a position paper in  2010 redefining giftedness  (pdf) to include that some gifted individuals face barriers due to issues such as poverty, discrimination, learning disabilities as well as motivational and emotional problems. “Identification of these students will need to emphasize aptitude rather than relying only on demonstrated achievement,” the paper stated.
Educational options for the gifted but not neatly-packaged student
If homeschooling is not a preferred option, how would students like Aidan receive an education? Dr. Ellen Richer, the founding head of the new  Quad Preparatory School , a private school in New York City, which serves gifted middle school students who also have special social, emotional and/or learning needs, explained to Quartz that gifted education is inconsistent across states and even school districts. Protecting Aidan’s right to receive an appropriate education that matches his intellectual capabilities may not be clearly defined. “For example, the Common Core standards mandate a certain scope or sequence of education for all of the academic subjects,” she said, but “they have nothing that is well thought out in a scope and sequence point-of-view for gifted education.”
Richer is accurate in her assessment as even the definitions of gifted education vary by state. A recent report by the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented at the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education surveyed schools across the country and found that they rarely examined student learning outcomes to guide gifted education programming. The report also stated that school districts were rather dependent on local funding for providing gifted education services. Nearly 40% of districts with elementary gifted programs received no state funding. Moreover, the gifted and talented classroom where Aidan had been placed isn’t the most prevalent model in the US. Fifty percent of students who receive gifted education usually receive pull-out services for just one to four hours per week.
In this state of disarray, it is not surprising that Aidan couldn’t find any support to remain receiving gifted education through the public school system. It’s worth noting also that federal law requires that he not be excluded from gifted programs based on his disability. In an official letter,  the US Department of Education stated in 2007, qualified students with disabilities should be given the same opportunities to compete for and benefit from accelerated programs and classes as are given to students without disabilities.
Yet Aidan’s mother did not feel the benefit of these protections: “We were working so hard to work with them (the school) that it wasn’t clear to us that all they wanted to do was get him out of the school.” The city was never able to find him a suitable placement and his parents were able to enroll him for third grade in a private school that served students like Aidan, many of whom were gifted with special needs. Aidan’s parents later sued the city for tuition reimbursement. The city settled with Aidan’s parents and gave a partial reimbursement of the tuition which still left thousands of dollars of tuition and lawyer fees that Aidan’s parents would have to pay on their own. For every year Aidan attends this school, they must hire a lawyer and sue for tuition even though the city had never come up with a placement recommendation for him when they most needed one.
For those children that do find themselves in the public special education system, oftentimes their learning environments are still inappropriate. “The academics are completely shifted to the sidelines,” says Richer noting that students at her school have experienced this often. “They languish in special ed classes.”
Webb emphasized that “extraordinarily few” teachers have ever received training to recognize the flashes of brilliance that they so often see with the gifted kids.
Brilliant is an understatement when trying to describe students like 16-year-old Jacob Barnett, another twice-exceptional student who is a child prodigy living with autism. Barnett is famous for his work in quantum physics and could have been one of those children destined to languish in special education. The teen scientist described it best in his  TEDxTeen video , “So, they took me to special ed which was extremely special in the fact that it didn’t educate me at all.” His YouTube video “Forget What You Know” has reached over 3 million views.
A gifted education model for all children
Halley Potter, a fellow at  The Century Foundation  and co-author of the forthcoming book  A Smarter Charter: Finding What Works for Charter Schools and Public Education , recently published an article describing what she found to be an ideal situation for gifted students . It involves no admissions testing, works within guidelines of evidence-based research, and successfully creates an integrated and productive environment where not only gifted students but all students can access academic enrichment in a school where 20% of the students were also receiving special education services.
The  Bell Academy   in Queens, New York, is a middle school that employs the  Schoolwide Enrichment Model  created by gifted education researchers Joseph Renzulli and Sally Reis. Potter had been studying the efforts at Bell Academy because she was interested at looking at different models that took the lessons in gifted education but didn’t create the kind of racially and economically segregated environments that are seen in many gifted and talented programs today.
Potter said that the educational model that Bell Academy uses allows all the students in the school to take part in gifted enrichment but also address issues of special needs that require extra support. At Bell, teachers have access to tools such as databases for reading materials based on topics and interests that also help them provide such materials at “just-right” levels for students’ individual needs. “It is a tool that can really help a sixth grade teacher who is having to differentiate instruction for this integrated classroom,” Potter told me, as teachers could have students coming in reading at several levels below grade level as well as several levels above.
It is difficult to believe that a school can be productive this way but at Bell Academy, Potter found that teachers can approach curriculum differently. The high performance levels on the students’ standardized test scores for the school indicates that  Bell is more than meeting state expectations .
Even better than test scores, a visit to a classroom speaks volumes about the efficacy of this type of gifted education. Potter said that some students may test out of a unit on a pretest and be given a challenge instead. She observed a time when a class had been learning environmental sustainability around the same time they were learning about Greek civilizations: “Students who had shown that they were advanced in both of these subjects were pulled out for this individual unit to work together on a self-directed project where they designed what the most sustainable Greek city would have looked like,” Potter observed.
Perhaps if Aidan attended a school like Bell Academy, things would have been different for him. But Bell Academy is only available to students living in a school district in which Aidan does not live. Webb also questions whether the Renzulli model could meet the needs of gifted children who lack motivation and are more commonly known as “underachievers.”
Despite the hardship, Aidan’s parents are happy to have their son back. Aidan’s mother recalls telling him he didn’t have to return to the gifted and talented classroom that caused him tremendous pain. “The day that we told him he didn’t have to go back to school, it was like a light came back on. Within a week, the nightmares were gone, the interest was back.”

Smart cities to be identified before Budget: VenkaiahNaiduPress Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: September 22, 2014 6:09 pm
The Centre will start identifying urban areas which can be transformed into “smart cities”, before the Budget, Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu said here on Monday.
The government is currently holding consultations with all stakeholders including state governments, local bodies and those keen on developing smart cities.
“I have held consultation with my state counterparts and taken them into confidence. Now we are at the advance stage of finalising the contours of the smart cities and by November we expect the process to be completed…and expect to identify the cities before the Budget,” Naidu, who was in town today for the Ieema annual convention, told reporters.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has envisaged developing 100 smart cities by 2022. The Finance Ministry has allocated Rs 7,060 crore for developing these cities as well, which will replace the present flagship urban renewal scheme JNNURM.
“I am planning to complete the process of consultation and finalisation of the contours by end of November and take them to the Expenditure Finance Committee and then to Cabinet. Then from the beginning of the year, roll out will begin,” he said.
“We plan to have at least 2-3 smart cities in each state,” he said.
Emphasising the need for taking all the stakeholders on board, he said, “You have to take the states and urban local bodies into confidence. Then you need support from different sectors and you need finances, which need a lot of consultations. We have finalised PPP model for developing smart cities.”
Naidu further said there is an increased interest from other countries to participate in this project. “I have held consultations with a lot of foreign delegations who are interested in participating in this project. Japan is keen to cooperate to transform Varanasi into a smart city. Similarly, a former Singaporean Prime Minister has also met me and expressed interest in constructing a new capital for Andhra, which I want to make into a smart city,” he said.
He said he will visit cities like Oklahoma and Seoul to understand their models.
However, he noted that creating a smart city is not an easy task. “It is not easy to construct a smart city overnight without light and basic amenities. We need to prepare habitat with a smart leadership. Further, there is a need to provide facilities for transport, water, disposal of waste, traffic security management, education, entertainment and employment opportunities, among others. All these things will take time,” he said.
“In this entire process, having 24×7 power supply will be critical. A city cannot be smart if there is no power. Therefore, there is a need to create proper transmission and distribution system to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity,” Naidu continued…

Chinese Prez accepts role of Buddhism in their culture: DalaiLamaPrint
PTI | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 5:56 pm
Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama today claimed that Chinese President Xi Jinping has publicly admitted that Buddhism has a role to play in the preservation of Chinese culture.
He added this was for the first time in years that any leader of the Communist Party of China, which rules the country, has openly acknowledged the role of religion in Chinese society.
“Preservation of Tibetan Buddhist knowledge, culture and language is of immense value to the Chinese people. President Xi Jinping has publicly said that Buddhism has a role to play in the preservation of Chinese culture.
“I think till 30 years ago… or even 15-20 years ago, no other Communist party leader (was seen) showing some respect to or appreciation of Buddha dharma. Preservation of Tibetan culture, Buddhism, Buddhist leadership… should be paid some attention,” Dalai Lama said.
The Tibetan spiritual leader was delivering a lecture here on, ‘One World, One Vision, One Future’.
Talking about the demand for Tibetan independence, the Dalai Lama said that while pressing for freedom from China it was crucial to remember that spirituality was an important element of Tibetan culture.
“Some (Tibetans) say independence… there is too much of emotion. Tibet is spiritually very rich. But some Tibetans stay as illegal immigrants in Canada, US and some European countries. They are not talking spirituality. They are seeking dollars and euros.
“They should remain in China as far as economy and material development (is concerned)… everyone seeks money from China,” he said.
“They (China) must give us genuine freedom for preservation of our culture. In long run this will be of immense help to Chinese Buddhists,” the Dalai Lama added.
Talking about violence perpetrated in the name of religion, the Dalai Lama said that the kidnapping and killings in Iraq and Syria were harmful to the image of Islam. He added that attacks on Muslims in Sri Lanka and Burma by Buddhists were similarly smearing their religion.
“If they really love their religion, then this kind of behaviour is really harmful for the image of Islam. Similarly, some Buddhists in Burma and to some extent in Sri Lanka are harming Muslims.
“When I first heard about this I was in Washington… I said those Buddhists must first think. Practice of Buddhism is practise of ‘karuna’. We really need some genuine harmony and mutual respect,” the Dalai Lama said.
He added that tolerance and respect for different views, faiths and philosophies was essential in order to achieve global peace and amity.
“To solve the problems of climate and ecology, 7 billion people must work together as one,” the Dalai Lama said.

Widows to participate in Durga Puja festival in Kolkata

Mathura: It would be a homecoming experience for fifty widows from Vrindavan as they will celebrate Durga Puja festival during their week-long visit to Kolkata, commencing from Thursday.
Sulabh International, an NGO, working for the empowerment of the widows, is organising the visit.
"The widows, who belong to West Bengal, would not only watch famous Durga Puja celebrations in Kolkata but would get an opportunity to visit the area, where they were born and brought up and married," an official from the organisation told reporters today.
Sulabh International, an NGO, working for the empowerment of the widows, is organising the visit.
"It would be virtually like homecoming after decades," she said.
Around fifty widows of Vrindavan had already visited Kolkata during Durga Puja celebrations last year, she said.
"Though we came to Vrindavan to pay our obeisance to the Lord Krishna for salvation, however, there can be no substitute to home and there can be no better experience than visiting the area one is born and brought up," an 85-year-old Maanu Ghosh said.
"When we came to Vrindavan from Kolkata about two decades ago, we never had dreamt of visiting our motherland again," 80-year-old Aarati Mistry said.
95-year-old Kanak Lata Devi, who has passed her over four decades in lotus feet of Radha Rani in Vrindavan, is eager to meet the Governor and Chief Minister of West Bengal.
"We have sought an appointment from these two dignitaries for them," the NGO official said.
Metro and Tram ride would be another thrilling experience for them, she said.

Firefighter electrocuted in Kentucky ice bucket challenge accident has diedA Campbellsville fire captain was fatally injured when the ladder from this fire truck came too close to a power line on Aug. 21. (Reuters)
The viral ice bucket challenge fundraiser has been fading, but tragedy lingers for a Kentucky town.
A fire captain who was electrocuted during an ice bucket challenge gone wrong in Campbellsville  died on Saturday , a month after he was admitted to the hospital for his injuries.
Tony Grider, 41, was airlifted to a nearby hospital when the fire truck ladder that was being used to dump water on a group of students at the Campbellsville University came too close to a power line on Aug. 21.
Several firefighters were injured, including some who tried to climb the ladder to help their colleagues.
Grider, a 16-year veteran of the department, was in the bucket of the ladder with firefighter Simon Quinn, who was hospitalized for several weeks before being released.
The Ice Bucket Challenge was a smashing success for the ALS Foundation, raising more than $100 million for the organization. But the practice has caused some injuries – some fatal, including the death of an 18-year old in Scotland who jumped into a quarry after participating in the challenge.

Three Afghan military officers training in Cape Cod are missingBy Abby Phillip September 22 Follow @abbydphillip

Three missing Afghanistan National Army officers, who disappeared while participating in a training program in Massachusetts, were detained while attempting to cross the border into Canada and have been transferred to U.S. custody by the Canada Border Services Agency, a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said on Monday.
The men were detained while attempting to enter Canada at Rainbow Bridge, which connects the cities of Niagara Falls in New York and Ontario, said David Procopio, a Massachusetts State Police spokesman.
Procopio said officials with the Massachusetts State Police, which assisted in the search for the three officers, were notified on Monday that the men had been located and would be questioned by U.S. authorities.
The men – Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar — were in the United States to conduct joint military exercises at a base in Cape Cod. They went missing on Saturday during a trip to the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.
Their disappearance marked the second time this month that a group of Afghan trainees had gone missing while participating in programs in the United States.
In the latest incident, the three members of the Afghanistan National Army were reported missing after taking a trip to a shopping mall in Hyannis, according to CNN .
The three men were part of a group of 15 soldiers and officers from Afghanistan participating in annual joint exercises on Otis Air National Guard Base. Along with nearly 200 others from six countries, they were participating in military training exercises with the National Guard, Massachusetts National Guard spokesman James Sahady told the Boston Globe .
Officials said three Afghan National Army soldiers are missing from a joint military training exercise in Cape Cod, Mass. (Reuters)
The program has been held every year since 2004.
The three men who went missing are senior military officers who had been cleared by the State Department to participate in the exercises, Sahady said.
“There is no indication that they pose any threat to the public,” Sahady said, according to the Boston Herald .
This second incident came just days after two Afghan police officers  training with the Drug Enforcement Administration  in Quantico, Va., disappeared while on a tourism day trip to Washington on Sept. 13. The two men, Mohammad Yasin Ataye, 22, and Mohd Naweed Samimi, 24, were found on Sept. 18 in Buffalo, N.Y., where authorities believe they were trying to reunite with family .
DEA spokesman Rusty Payne noted that the men were chosen to participate in the training program because they were among “the best and brightest” in their country, according to CBS , which added:
According to the DEA, each candidate is extensively vetted and polygraphed. Ataye and Samimi entered the U.S. in mid-August with special visas and were participating in the DEA’s Sensitive Investigative Unit Program (SIU) which offers law enforcement agents from 13 countries training in surveillance, undercover operations and intelligence gathering among other things. Classes are taken on field trips on weekends.

Yamaha on fast track, plans third plant in India

It will boost overall output to over 4 million two-wheelers
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The inauguration of its Chennai plant is still a couple of months away but Yamaha is already contemplating its third facility in India.
The Japanese automaker has a unit in Surajpur, Uttar Pradesh, which can produce one million bikes and scooters annually. Capacity at the second plant in Chennai will be increased in phases to 1.8 million units by 2018.
“By this time, we should have a third unit coming up to take our overall numbers to over four million units by 2020,” a top company official told Business Line. In the process, India will emerge Yamaha’s largest region for production of two-wheelers, ahead of Indonesia and Vietnam.
According to the official, the western region of the country would be the ideal location for the third plant. “We already have operations in the north while Chennai will fill up the void in the south. The west is the best bet going forward,” he said.
It is here that Gujarat could end up bagging the Yamaha mandate for the new plant. It is already gearing up to play host to top brands such as Ford, Suzuki, Honda (two-wheelers and cars) and Hero MotoCorp. Gujarat is also quickly emerging as an alternative to Maharashtra as an auto hub in the west.
Yamaha is keen that its Indian operations play a big role in the new business plan for Africa, its next big market of the future. This also puts in perspective the role of its affordable motorcycle (estimated to be priced at around Rs 30,000) which will be produced in Chennai and shipped out to Africa.
For the first half of this calendar, Yamaha’s sales in India totalled 2.6 lakh units (from 2.03 lakh units in H1 of 2013) with Vietnam marginally ahead at 2.91 lakh units, a steep fall from last year’s 4.3 lakh units.
Numbers in Thailand for January-June crashed to 98,000 units from 2.11 lakh units in 2013 while Indonesia was at the forefront with sales of 1.3 million (1.27 million) units in H1 of this calendar.
From Yamaha’s point of view, the buoyancy in traditionally strong markets like Vietnam and Thailand is a thing of the past. And though Indonesia is chugging along without any hiccups, it is only a matter of time before India takes the top slot. This is thanks to its large base of young buyers coupled with a new role to service markets like Africa.
Clearly, the status of India has changed dramatically for Yamaha since the time it set up shop in the mid-1980s. What began as a dream run gradually turned awry after parting ways with the Escorts group. Today, Yamaha has identified India as an important sourcing hub for its global operations where the business will jump to Rs 360 crore (from Rs 60 crore) by end-2016.

Adivasi leaders demand probe into alleged molestation by CRPF jawan in Jharkhand districtPrint

Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Bandhgaon | Posted: September 22, 2014 6:29 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 7:16 pm
Frustrated by the second such incident in just over a fortnight and the police’s refusal to register an FIR, the traditional adivasi leaders of West Singhbhum’s Bandhgaon came together on Monday to ensure an investigation began into the allegation that a CRPF jawan molested a woman during an anti-left wing extremist operation.
It was an extraordinary show of solidarity from the Manki-Munda Sangh of Bandhgaon block, whose 216 Mundas and nine Mankis – traditional leaders who inherit their titles – decided on September 16 to protest the molestation. It was also an act of reclaiming territory: no elected representative, even those of the panchayats, were given pride of place. The leaders succeeded in convincing police officials to attend the meeting and initiating the process of registering an FIR.
The incident in question took place on the afternoon of September 8 in Kudmud village of Jalasar panchayat. “I was at home when a CRPF man walked in, demanding water. I could see two of his colleagues standing outside,” said the 25-year-old woman, whose husband was away at the time.
The woman said the CRPF man handed her two bottles to fill water. “When I asked for caps to close the bottles, he began stripping himself and caught hold of me,” she said. The woman said when she screamed for help, the three jawans escaped into the jungle. The village elders had taken the woman to the police station on September 9, but police officers refused to file an FIR.
At the meeting held under a peepul tree within the Bandhgaon market, the villagers presented three youngsters who told officer in-charge of the police station K.K. Jha and Block Development Officer Mohd. Shahzad Pervez that they were beaten with batons the same day. Of them, Etwa Lomga’s case related to the molestation. “I was down with fever when the CRPF personnel started interrogating me. They beat me twice on the shin with a baton. When I got a chance, I asked to go to the toilet and used the opportunity to escape,” he said. Etwa said he had run into the forest behind the woman’s house and that three CRPF jawans chased him to the edge of the forest.
Mikhail Lomga, the Munda of Kudmud, said it was the first time security personnel had misbehaved in his village. “The operation had been going on for about a week before the incident. Forces were stationed at schools in two villages – Kahdiri and Podongir. They came to our continued…

Apple sells 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 PlusesApple sells 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Pluses
By David Goldman   @DavidGoldmanCNN September 22, 2014: 11:32 AM ET
 
How much does your iPhone really cost?
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Those long lines at Apple Stores around the world translated into record iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales over the weekend.
Ten million to be exact. That beat last year's iPhone 5S opening weekend by 1 million sales.
The achievement is remarkable, considering that China wasn't a part of this year's opening weekend. Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) sold 9 million iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S smartphones during the first three days of sales a year ago -- a weekend that included Chinese sales.
Demand for the new, larger iPhone 6 has been insatiable. Apple sold a record 4 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones on Sept. 12, the first day that the new iPhones were available for pre-order. Pre-orders momentarily crashed Apple's website a week ago, and supply of the super-large iPhone 6 Plus quickly sold out.
For those who couldn't pre-order their phones, Apple made some supply of the devices available in stores on Sept. 19. Lines for the new iPhone snaked around city blocks, and many people camped out overnight.
 
The iPhone evolved
Somewhat less successful than adoption of the iPhone 6 is Apple's new iOS 8 software. Just 30% of iPhone users have installed the new software, which became available on Sept. 17, according to Mixpanel, a mobile operating system tracker. A year ago, more than half of iPhone customers had downloaded iOS 7 just three days after the software became available.

Still a long way to go with workplace discrimination11
The Tampa Tribune asked former NFL head coach Tony Dungy about Michael Sam, the first openly gay college player drafted into the league.
"I wouldn't have taken him,'' Dungy said. "Not because I don't believe Michael Sam should have a chance to play, but I wouldn't want to deal with all of it."
He later issued a clarification of his remarks, which stressed that he thinks Sam deserves a chance to play in the NFL and should not be evaluated based on his sexual orientation. But the clarification essentially made the same point: Dungy would have passed on a chance to draft Sam because he wouldn't want to deal with the media attention that would follow the league's first openly gay player.
I have news for Dungy: that's discrimination. He can say it has nothing to do with Sam being gay all he wants, but he's still basing a hiring decision on something more than the player's professional qualifications. Sam may or may not succeed with the St. Louis Rams -- the team that drafted him, distractions be damned -- but he will at least have that opportunity.
In 2002, when I was a reporter with the Associated Press, I interviewed Dungy, who had just been hired to coach the Indianapolis Colts. His hiring made Indiana, a one-time stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan, the state with the most black head coaches in high-profile jobs, with Tyrone Willingham coaching Notre Dame football, Mike Davis coaching Indiana University basketball and Isiah Thomas coaching the Indiana Pacers.
Nobody at the time called that rather significant development a distraction. Dungy said to me: "It just shows you that you can't prejudge anything. Just like you can't prejudge anyone."
In 2007, Dungy became the first black head coach to win a Super Bowl as the Colts defeated the Chicago Bears . There was no talk of him being a distraction before, during or after that game. There was only talk of him being a great -- and because of his race, historic -- coach.
To take this from the world of sports and into the everyday workplace, consider this: What if a company has no gay or lesbian employees and finds that a gay or lesbian person is the most qualified candidate for a job? Should that company worry about whether the employee will be a distraction?
No. That company should hire the most qualified person, period.
If everyone took Dungy's approach of minimizing "distractions," companies would be homogenous and lifeless, talented people would be shut-out of opportunities and there would be a lot fewer movies about Jackie Robinson, because he never would've played baseball.
Biases often hide in excuses like the one Dungy offered up. And our laws still allow those excuses to bar qualified LGBT people from jobs.
That needs to change.
Michael Sam will get his chance. And whether he makes it or not, the NFL and other openly gay players to come will benefit, proving once again that diversity enriches any workplace, and fear of distraction is a coward's excuse.

Lavish weddings still catch Indians  fancyStory
The allure of the lavish wedding
An increasing number of families across India are leaving no stone unturned when it comes to wedding festivities.
Maleeka Kashyap     Delhi   Edition: Sept 28, 2014
Saying "I do": A destination wedding has become the favoured choice for couples as their spending power rises. Nadia D. Photography
As the $38-billion Indian wedding market continues to grow bigger in size, the bridal brigade - brides, grooms and their respective families - across the country seems to have embraced the spending frenzy with open arms. About a decade ago, the most talked about society weddings were generally limited to familial lineages. Things, however, are changing now and anyone who has the required finances can surely have a grand wedding of their dreams.
Epicurean delights: Families don't mind spending Rs 1 crore on food by hiring top chefs, and dedicated catering service extras such as bartenders to cake artists
The growing trend of getting married out of the city one is based in, or even overseas, has caught up on every level - from metro-savvy to the illustrious and nouveau riche families in Tier-II and Tier-III cities such as Mysore in Karnataka to Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh.
Says Vandana Mohan, who conceived the New Delhi-based The Wedding Design Company: "For upscale weddings in India, the preferred locations are Rajasthan and Goa. I personally love Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Udaipur .  Kerala is popular among those who want to organise a relatively smaller wedding." With over two decades of event planning experience, Mohan, who is credited with having changed the wedding planning process in India, boasts a clientele that includes royalty and industrialists, among others.
FULL COVERAGE: Luxury Special 2014
Although Southeast Asian islands such as Koh Samui (Thailand), Langkawi (Malaysia) and Bali (Indonesia) seem to be the favourite wedding spots for Indian families for the last five years or so, the search of richer pastures and more exotic locales has pushed the boundaries to even greater heights.
"City-centric areas like London, Paris or New York are given a miss for sought-after destinations like Cannes (France), Florence (Italy) or Portugal," adds Mohan.
"In fact, I just did a wedding at Puglia in Italy. Regions in the south of France always remain a favoured choice." The most recent European destination wedding that made news in the country was of socialite Ayesha Thapar and Google's former senior vice-president Nikesh Arora. The star-studded multi-day celebration in Puglia even had Hollywoods Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis in attendance.
Epicurean delights: Families don't mind spending Rs 1 crore on food by hiring top chefs, and dedicated catering service extras such as bartenders to cake artists
It goes without saying that most destination weddings come with heftier price tags, but to say that they are just for the upper class would be wrong. "The past decade has seen some major changes in terms of wedding expenditure. Yes, weddings have become grander, but earlier only the elite were known for organising such lavish affairs. These days, a new consciousness has been seen in the upper middle-class as well. They too wish to have grand celebrations," says Jasleen Kochhar, Founder-Designer for Bougainvilla Design. The Delhi firm specialises in luxe floral and setup design, and has worked with French fashion houses such as Christian Dior and Chanel.
Its hospitality clients include the US-based Hilton and The Oberoi Group in India. Speaking of numbers, Kochhar says: "It is quite common for people to spend over Rs 1 crore on just food and decor , while on an average, the upper middle-class tends to save up and spend Rs 3 crore to Rs 6 crore on a wedding. A high-end affair would involve anywhere between Rs 10 crore and Rs 20 crore, and an uber-luxurious celebration involves funds upwards of Rs 20 crore."
It's all in the details: In addition to the venue and travel expenses, the overheads of a destination wedding include costs of hiring other personnel such as a photographer and makeup artist
Then there is the exclusivity factor of making your wedding unique in terms of every nuance involved, which is the new demand of High Net Worth Individual (HNWI) families. Forget about copying the fairytale wedding of NRI steel baron LN Mittal's daughter Vanisha Mittal, which had set a new benchmark back in the day. The idea now is to be innovative, especially when it comes to design and decor. Says Sumant Jayakrishnan, the mastermind behind ornate runway sets of couturiers in the country, to larger-than-life installations at family nuptials: "On an average, I tend to design only two weddings in a year." And needless to say, availing his services has a long waiting list.
As far as the guest list goes, as expected, no tables have been left unturned here too. Ravish Kapoor, who designed the invitation cards for Bollywood actresses Shilpa Shetty and Karisma Kapoor's weddings, points out: "At the end of the day, the invite is designed around the destination where the wedding is taking place." Ravish's destination wedding card can cost from Rs 30,000 to more than Rs 1 lakh. As for the gifting tradition with the cards, he says: "People generally prefer Ganesha idols, and sweets. But at times they may also want something different - something specific to the location."
It's all in the details: In addition to the venue and travel expenses, the overheads of a destination wedding include costs of hiring other personnel such as a photographer and makeup artist
As for the number of guests, Ravish says: "Usually, a destination wedding is limited to the size of the hotel. But from our experience, it is usually 200 to 250 guests in attendance, with a much larger reception that is held at home." And these guests, of course, get the best treatment - from travelling in private charter flights to staying in luxe properties or castles to eating Michelin-rated cuisines and experiencing Shakira-esque entertainment. One may recall television personality Rannvijay Singha's wedding to his London-based girlfriend Priyanka Vohra in Mombasa, Kenya from April this year. The quintessential Indian affair was even videoblogged and presented to fans and friends over the Internet ' probably the first of its kind in the country.
It goes without saying that most destination weddings come with heftier price tags.
Last, a realistic figure is hard to calculate while budgeting such weddings as it varies from client to client. "These costs tend to be subjective as it all depends on the family. The cost of organising a wedding in Southeast Asia is similar to organising a wedding in India, the only difference being the addition of ticket prices. The cost of a European destination can be estimated by tripling the expenditure of a European holiday and multiplying the said figure by 400," says The Wedding Design Company's Mohan. Add to this the overheads of epicurean craftsmen, lens and video masters, makeup magicians, et al, to create a fantasy wedding for the ages.

Project to upgrade water supply network, expand sewerage infrastructure and improve roads in North Karnataka towns
The NDA Government at the Centre signed an agreement with Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Tuesday for a Rs.284 crore loan for improving urban services and strengthening municipal and project management capacity in several towns in North Karnataka.
The agreement is for the 4th Project under the overall facility of $270 million for the North Karnataka Urban Sector Investment Programme.
The fourth and last tranche of loan under the North Karnataka Urban Sector Investment Program will help upgrade infrastructure, including expansion of the potable water systems to provide continuous water supply with private sector participation in 12 towns: Basavakalyan, Bellary, Bidar, Gadag-Betegeri, Gokak, Haveri, Hospet, Nipanni, Raichur, Shahabad, Sindhanur and Yadgir. The funds will also go towards the completion of sewerage networks in three towns (Haveri, Hospet and Raichur) and improvements to the road network in 2 towns (Badami and Ilkal).
Tarun Bajaj, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance and M. Teresa Kho, Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission, signed the agreement, according to a PIB press release.
Mr Bajaj said that the project will help upgrade water supply network, expand sewerage infrastructure and improve roads in 14 towns of North Karnataka. He said that this will help the State improve quality of life in these deprived areas of Karnataka. Water utility operators will be engaged through performance-based management contracts to design and construct sections of the distribution networks, provide metered connections and operate and maintain the facilities, he added.
The programme will support a municipal governance program through the use of geographic information systems for property tax mapping and utility mapping, as well as assist the Government of Karnataka to establish a heritage planning cell under the Town Planning Department, for conservation of heritage structures and sites in the State.
The complete investment aimed to improve basic urban services for at least 4.3 million people living in 25 North Karnataka towns by providing them with improved water supply, cleaner environmental conditions, safer and faster urban transportation, and other public facilities.
The project agreement was also signed by D. Chandrashekaraiah, Joint Director (Planning), Urban Development Department, Government of Karnataka and Arifulla Shariff, Executive Director, Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development & Finance Corporation Limited.

Jignesh Shah logs out of MCX  Kotak steps inMahesh Nayak      Follow @MaheshNayak    Edition: Sept 28, 2014
Temporary relief: MCX promoter Jignesh Shah after being released from Kalyan jail in Mumbai. Photo: PTI
Jignesh Shah had already made up his mind to quit the stock exchange business in October 2013, two months before the commodities' market regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) declared him and his company, Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL), unfit to run any exchange.
According to a close associate of his, Shah, who set up the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) in 2003, the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) in 2007, and the stock exchange MCX-SX in 2008, had declared his intention at a seven-hour-long meeting in his lawyers' South Mumbai office that month.
The Rs 5,500-crore NSEL scam had broken in July: the exchange was found to be executing contracts without sufficient underlying assets and had defaulted on its payments when investors wanted to pull out. "He saw what was brewing," says the associate. "He knew people were after his blood as many had not liked his entry into the stock exchange business."
Shah's lawyers, however, convinced him to fight on.
The effort proved futile. The FMC's December 2013 order left Shah and FTIL no choice. FTIL, which had 26 per cent stake in the exchange, initially sold six per cent in the open market, including two per cent to well-known investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala.
Subsequently, the rest was sold as well: 15 per cent - the maximum permissible to a single entity under the new FMC rules - to the Uday Kotak-promoted Kotak Mahindra Bank for Rs 459 crore and the remaining five per cent on the open market for Rs 827 to Rs 830 a share.
The NSEL had already closed down after the scam came to light and the MCX-SX too is as good as dead with no trading happening on the exchange. Among his other travails, Shah was also arrested in May this year, but was recently released on bail .
Its erstwhile promoter's tribulations, however, have not affected MCX significantly. Its turnover may have fallen but its market share is still above 80 per cent.
"There is an early-mover advantage," says Ramesh Abhishek, Chairman, FMC. "If one exchange attracts liquidity in one commodity, others find it difficult to divert those volumes to their exchanges."
Samir Shah, Managing Director and CEO of the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), MCX's closest rival, not only agrees, but also suggests a different reason for the overall fall in trading volumes.
"Though we have garnered some market share, the commodity transaction tax (CTT) has been the primary reason we were not able to take full advantage of the NSEL crisis and attract players to our platform." The finance ministry introduced a CTT of 0.01 per cent on the transactional value of a host of commodities in July 2013. Indeed, MCX saw a big fall in turnover following the imposition of CTT. The NSEL scam added to its woes.
'We think we will make money from the asset not because of the price we paid but because of the quality of the asset,' says Paul Parambi, Group Head Strategy, Kotak Mahindra Bank.
MCX's rock solid performance through the crisis is the reason why Kotak Mahindra Bank could not buy its stake at the price it had hoped, but had to fork out Rs 600 per share. (In June, Business Today had been among the first to report that Kotak Mahindra Bank was likely to pick up a stake in MCX ). MCX remained unshaken despite Jignesh Shah's arrest in May as well as the forensic audit of the exchange ordered by the FMC - and carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers - which found several irregularities in its functioning.
Even the fact that it was the sole bidder did not help Kotak get a better price. "From the beginning it was only Kotak Mahindra Bank that was interested," says a source who was closely involved in FTIL selling its stake in MCX on condition of anonymity. "There was no other qualified bidder which could have picked 15 per cent stake in MCX. In fact, Kotak wanted to buy the entire 26 per cent."
"Kotak quoted Rs 550-575 per share, but eventually increased the price to Rs 600," says a source closely involved with the deal, on condition of anonymity. The bank, however, claims it is fully satisfied.
"We believe Rs 600 per share is a fair price," says Paul Parambi, Group Head Strategy at Kotak Mahindra Bank. "We think we will make money from the asset not because of the price we paid but because of the asset's quality. We factored in a lot of positives and potential negatives before taking our decision."
He lists the positives. "We have liked the financial infrastructure space for some time and believe that as India grows this space will also grow," says Parambi.
"And as more players participate in the ownership of different asset classes, it can provide a further upside apart from the normal growth that happens. MCX has a strong franchise in the commodity space particularly in the metals and crude segment. An opportunity to acquire 15 per cent stake in MCX which usually would not be available was therefore attractive for us."
Besides, what Kotak paid per share was less than the Rs 664 per share that Jhunjhunwalla had forked out earlier for his two per cent - which took his total stake in MCX to slightly less than 3.5 per cent. The first tranche of shares FTIL sold in the open market fetched a price of Rs 720 per share. During the second open market sale, even SBI Life Insurance shelled out Rs 830 per share to acquire less than one per cent of MCX.
Kotak already owns 40 per cent stake in Ahmedabad Commodity Exchange (ACE), which it bought in 2009, but that has not given it much traction in this space so far. "ACE has reinforced our view that market share is difficult to gain," says Parambi. Clearly, acquiring a dominant exchange is an easier route than trying to snatch market share. "The entire financial space including equity and commodities has gone through difficult times. Our view is that at some point there will be a trigger which will make this space look good," he adds.
Kotak, however, has ensured that unlike FTIL, it will not be considered a 'promoter' of MCX. It has a clause in its agreement with MCX to that effect and has made it clear it will annul the deal if SEBI labels it thus. But that does not mean, market insiders feel, it will eschew an active role in MCX's decision making.
"We are not saying we want to run the exchange," says Parambi. "But we have enough skin in the game as we are paying close to Rs 460 crore."

The FMC has cleared the MCX-Kotak deal and the market buzz it that once capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Reserve Bank of India and the Competition Commission of India do so too, Kotak will have a board nominee and may also decide who the new CEO and managing director of MCX should be.
More than anything else Kotak is betting on new amendments to the Forward Contract Regulation Act (FCRA) to liven up things.
"Over a period of time if regulation evolves, if option trading is permitted, if CTT is reduced, if institutions are allowed to participate in the commodity market, then each of these will provide non-linear kickers to growth," says Parambi. "We don't know when these will happen, but they will happen. These were important considerations when we looked at acquiring our stake in MCX."
An FCRA bill with the amendments is likely to be placed before Parliament either in the winter session later this year or next year's budget session. "We have sent a revised FCRA amendment bill to the department and it will take a decision," says FMC Chairman Abhishek. "There are not too many changes, but it will put us on par with SEBI." Many observers agree. "If the regulations change, it can also trigger a merger between MCX and ACE. Volumes will jump manifold and could even double Kotak's valuation in MCX in a single day," says P.H. Ravikumar, former CEO and Managing Director of NCDEX.
It is the end of the road for Jignesh Shah but for Kotak it could be the beginning of a new dawn.

John Lobb shoes offer the right fit at a priceStory
The Right fit, at a price
It is a shoe that takes nine months to make and, hold your breath, can set you back by a whopping Rs 10 lakh.
Arunima Mishra      Follow @Mishra_Arunima    Edition: Sept 28, 2014
Destination India: Thomas Collette, Commercial Director for Europe, Middle East and India at John Lobb, with 'By Request' shoes, launched in India in June.
"The John Lobb shoe is precious and travels from generation to generation. When a shoe costs more than Rs 1 lakh it's like a piece of jewellery," says Atul Nanda, a Delhi-based lawyer. Nanda has been a customer of the European shoemaker for the past 15 years, much before its debut in India in June this year with its 'By Request' service (it allows clients to customise shoes from available styles).
John Lobb's odyssey in India dates back to the early 1900s when members of Indian royal families were its clients. Owned by French luxury house Hermes Group, John Lobb has designed and custom made shoes for the wealthy and famous since 1866. Its customers in the past have included the likes of Frank Sinatra, George Bernard Shaw, Dean Martin and Aristotle Onassis, to name a few.
The 'By Request' service will allow clients to personalise their shoe within their global "JL Ready-To-Wear range", according to Thomas Collette, Commercial Director for Europe, Middle East and India at John Lobb. "However, what we call 'Specials' (exclusive models designed for a specific store or market) is something we love to offer to our clients, on top of our existing collections. As soon as we will know more about the market, no doubt we will be able to offer the same to India." The price of shoes in its 'By Request' range is between Rs 70,000 and Rs 7.5 lakh.
Made to order: The process of making Bespoke John Lobb shoes: (1) creating the wooden last.
The company is planning to scale up its India presence. It gradually plans to introduce its popular Bespoke (made to order) service in India. It allows customer to decide every detail, every colour about their footwear. "Introducing Bespoke in India is obviously on our mind. However, this offer will come at a later stage," says Collette.
designing a pattern.
John Lobb has been making Bespoke boots since its inception. In its Paris workshop, highly qualified craftsmen create unique shoes according to the customers requirements. Each pair of Bespoke shoes requires an average of 50 hours of work by craftsmen and the entire process takes about nine months.
It starts with a craftsman taking a series of foot measurements, while the client chooses the model, shape, type of leather, the height of the heel and other details. The client returns for a second appointment to try on a mock-up of the shoe. This allows the craftsman to further refine the last, a metal or wooden form over which a shoe is shaped. The final fitting and delivery of the shoe is done in the third meeting. Every pair created in the Bespoke workshop is designed to last several years. A John Lobb shoe is durable - it can be worn at least 7,000 times.
VIDEO: John Lobb offers timeless products
Indeed, a Bespoke shoe has a relatively complicated manufacturing process as compared with Ready To Wear (RTW) or By Request shoes. It has a specific last created for it -the shape of the foot is sculpted in hornbeam wood. "For RTW/By Request, we use existing lasts depending on the shoe style, and the size produced," says Saskia Porretta Menne, Sales and Marketing Coordinator for Europe, Middle East and India at John Lobb.
Making the shoe mould.
The Bespoke service doesn't have a fixed price. The final price depends on the style, leather and other specifications of the customer and can exceed Rs 10 lakh. "However, the starting price is Rs 5.5 lakh for a first pair of John Lobb Bespoke shoes," adds Menne.
John Lobb Bespoke shoes are an extension of the personality of the wearer. Pratik Dalmia, President, Regalia Luxury Retail (John Lobb's partner in India), says there's certainly a big market for the Bespoke service. John Lobb's By Request launch has exceeded its expectations in terms of orders from the clients, he says.
"The target customer for Bespoke is different from the customer who buys By Request shoes," adds Dalmia.
The finished product
THE MORE THE MERRIER
Many of John Lobb's global competitors - Maison Corthay, Berluti and Gaziano & Girling - have hardly any presence in India. But some of its rivals including Tod's, Zegna, and Gucci, do have limited operations in the country. While Tod's and Gucci operate at a similar price point as John Lobb, Zegna's "Made to Order" shoes are slightly more expensive. These luxury brands offer bespoke services mostly through workshops and events. These services are generally not offered through retail stores since they are targeted at the super-rich. Bespoke shoes are typically costlier than other categories, such as "by request" and "ready to wear".

Climate Change You Can Believe Inreddit
Previously published on BillMoyers.com
Just as Sunday's big People's Climate March and next week's UN global summit on climate converge here in New York City, the nation and world are experiencing weather of an intensity that should rattle the stubborn false convictions of even the most fervent climate change denier.
Terrible flooding in India and Pakistan, the worst in more than a century, with heavy monsoon rains, 500 lives lost and hundreds of thousands left stranded... thousands of wildfires ignited by severe drought in California and the West... flashfloods in Arizona... the punch of a hurricane pounding Mexico's Baja coast, the strongest in nearly 50 years, battering locals and trapping tourists in their hotels without electricity.
We know it's important not to confuse day-to-day weather patterns with climate, which measure variations of things like temperatures and humidity over long periods of time, but it's clear that these disasters are made more powerful by global warming. The pain is only going to get worse for us and for future generations, unless we act now. Our governments must reduce those carbon emissions that are heating up the atmosphere before it's too late.
But up to now, world leaders have refused to give global warming the crisis treatment that's needed, even as the evidence mounts day by day. A draft report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that the vast amounts of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere will have "severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts," and that we're already seeing the effect in heat waves, floods and rising sea levels. Another UN report, this one from the World Meteorological Organization, says that amounts of carbon dioxide -- the gas that traps heat in our atmosphere -- are increasing even faster than scientists predicted, more than in the last 800,000 years at least. The accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers has crunched the numbers and spots an "unmistakable trend" that puts us just 20 years away from catastrophe. "In a highly globalized economy," they write, "no country is likely to be spared as the impacts of climate change ripple around the world..."
If for some reason you don't believe the scientists and the accountants, listen to the birds. Last week, the National Audubon Society reported that of some 650 bird species studied in the United States and Canada, "more than half are... at risk from global warming." The study's chief author, Gary Langham, told The New York Times, "The notion that we can have a future that looks like what our grandparents experienced, with the birds they had, is unlikely." Imagine a world without birdsong.
But climate change deniers persist in telling us it just ain't so, like the tobacco industry claiming for decade after decade that nicotine wasn't addictive or that cigarettes couldn't kill you. It's been more than a decade since Oklahoma Republican James Inhofe, once chair of the US Senate's committee on the environment and public works, told us that "man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people." He still says he thinks so and so do many of his allies.
Slick public relations and advertising campaigns are underwritten to fool the public and smear the truthtellers. Foundations and think tanks have been created by industry just to create doubt and hammer away against the overwhelming evidence of climate disruption. Last year, the British newspaper The Guardian reported that between 2002 and 2010, via two right-wing groups, Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund, billionaires had given nearly $120 million to more than 100 anti-climate change groups. And the progressive Center for Media and Democracy revealed that a web of right-wing think tanks called the State Policy Network, affiliated with the notorious American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and funded to the tune of $83 million by companies including Facebook, AT&T and Microsoft, was pushing a had right agenda that includes opposition to climate change rules and regulations.
A new study from two groups, Forecast the Facts Action and the SumOfUs.org, says that since 2008, businesses have given campaign contributions to the 160 members of Congress who have rejected climate change that amount to more than $640 million. That includes Google, eBay, Ford and UPS; in fact, 90 percent of the cash came from outside the fossil fuel industry.
Many of the naysayers are not in total denial; they either say climate change is happening more slowly than we think -- the so-called "lukewarmers" -- or they insist that global warming actually is good for you! Here's a headline from the conservative Heartland Institute: "Benefits of Global Warming Greatly Exceed Costs, New Study Says." And here's a statement responding to that new UN report on carbon dioxide from Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Cato Institute's Center for the Study of Science. Cato has received funding from the Koch brothers -- much of whose billions have come from fossil fuels -- and Exxon Mobil. We should, Knappenberger said, be proud of those greenhouse gases and "applaud our progress in energy expansion around the world," and he noted a previous statement of his in which he exulted that the rise in carbon dioxide "is cause for celebration."
Much of this has little to do with the reality of science, some has to do with fundamentalist religious beliefs but most has to do with, you guessed it, money and politics. A study by the journal Climatic Change finds that the more wealthy Republicans are, the more likely they are to think that rising global temperatures are non-existent or no big deal. After all, the industries that are causing the problem -- especially anything to do with the extraction or use of fossil fuels -- are making them filthy rich. And many of them actually believe further climate change could be good for business. Those melting icecaps and glaciers are opening up waterways in the north, you see. And the defense contractor Raytheon Industries sees big profit opportunities because "climate change may cause humanitarian disasters, contribute to political violence and undermine weak governments." We're not making this up.
So intense is the political and corporate opposition to the concept of manmade climate change -- despite a majority of Americans who accept it as reality -- that some of the more rational officeholders and local governments quietly are trying to work around the resistance, preparing for the worst without mentioning the dreaded words climate change or global warming. In Grand Haven, Michigan, AP reports, officials are preparing for heat waves and storm erosion without saying anything about you-know-what. In Florida, communities are taking steps to protect towns against rising sea levels without getting into a fight over what's causing them. In Tulsa, Oklahoma -- where Senator Jim Inhofe used to be mayor -- flood control and drought prevention are sought in the name not of warming but of disaster preparedness.
Meanwhile, some of the media finally are coming around, catching up with public opinion. Once enslaved to the notion of having to give equal weight to both sides despite the overwhelming evidence supporting climate change, they're changing their tune. A few months ago, the independent BBC Trust said that the British broadcaster was giving "undue attention to marginal opinion" when it came to airtime for climate deniers and should adjust accordingly. The Los Angeles Times announced it would no longer print climate change denial letters to the editor -- contrast that with Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal, which last year ran more anti-climate change letters than any other major newspaper. And last month, The Washington Post, long criticized for the space given such climate deniers as columnist George Will, ran a week's worth of climate change editorials, declaring, in the words of its editorial page editor, "an existential threat to the planet."
So we have to ask, how long will we allow the climate deniers the prominence and weight that lets them give our political leaders cover to run and hide from reality?
Two men in Massachusetts decided: No longer. This past May, they used their lobster boat -- the Henry David T., as in Henry David Thoreau -- to block a coal freighter from docking at a Massachusetts power station. They turned themselves in and faced charges that could have resulted in two years in jail and thousands of dollars in fines.
But last week, the local district attorney, Sam Sutter, stood on the courthouse steps and announced that he had dropped the criminal charges. "Climate change is one of the gravest crises our planet has ever faced," he said. "In my humble opinion, the political leadership on this issue has been gravely lacking."
He then announced his intention to be at the People's Climate March in New York.
Pope Francis would say "amen" to that. "Safeguard Creation," he warned, just around the same time the Henry David T. was blocking that coal freighter. "Because if we destroy Creation, Creation will destroy us!"

How FICO s New Credit Score Will Impact Consumersreddit
Fair Issac Corp., the creator of the widely used FICO score, is switching up how it computes credit scores. The new score, known as FICO 9 , will be rolled out to the three major credit bureaus this fall. But what does this mean for consumers?
The Good News
Non-traditional credit, such as your residential rental history, will be taken into consideration. This means that consumers who have little to no credit history but pay rent on time will get a boost. Since payment history and the length of that payment history currently account for approximately 50 percent of your FICO credit score, more consumers will have the opportunity to build a positive credit history through non-traditional means.
Medical collections will have a lower impact on your credit score. Previously, all collection debts--regardless of type and if they're paid--hurt your credit score equally. The new version will give you a break on medical debt, which is great news for the millions of Americans with a medical collection on their credit report. According to FICO, scores could rise by a median of 25 points for consumers whose only negative references are medical collections.
Paid-off and settled collections will be ignored. Under the previous FICO model, if you let an account go into collection, your credit score would take a hit for as long as that collection is on your credit report (seven years). Not so with the new version. Now, as long as the collection has a zero balance, it will be ignored.
The Bad News
Lenders determine when and if to use the new FICO score. While the credit bureaus will be making FICO 9 available to lenders sometime later this fall or in early 2015, lenders will ultimately determine when to use the new score. The reality is that it can cost a significant amount of money to change the current automated underwriting systems. Lenders are already under other regulatory pressures and may not have the time or resources to implement FICO 9 in the near term.
Paid-off and settled collections are still on your credit report. While collections with a zero balance will be ignored, those collections will still show up on your credit report for seven years. So while they won't hurt your credit score, lenders may still have concerns about those debts and can choose to penalize you or give you less advantageous terms.

Grounded: How these Indian tycoons landed in soupThey were famed for their jet-set lifestyles and the names of their companies were emblazoned on airplanes, Formula One cars and the shirtfronts of cricket teams.
   
But now the debt-laden empires of three of India's best-known tycoons — Vijay Mallya, Subrata Roy and T Venkattram Reddy —  are crumbling before their eyes, downfalls that observers say stem from a climate of weak regulation and deference to conspicuous wealth.
   
"All too often, the banks are dazzled by the halo of personal fortunes," said Vishwas Utagi, a veteran campaigner for banking regulation.
   
Some of India's most successful businesses, such as the family-run Tata and Reliance conglomerates, have been led for years by men with little appetite for publicity and who prefer to operate in the shadows.
   
But Kingfisher boss Mallya and Sahara supremo Roy came to epitomise a new breed of tycoon, unafraid of trumpeting their achievements when they started making a name for themselves in the early 2000s.
   
Mallya —  the self-styled "King of Good Times" —  became something of an icon as he turned the United Breweries Group which he inherited from his father into one of the world's largest spirit makers.

As his core business flourished, Mallya branched out by launching the Kingfisher airline, named after his company's best-known beer. His profile rose further when he acquired a stake in the Force India F1 team and ownership of the Royal Challengers Bangalore cricket team.
Selling hotels for bail 
    
But as the Indian economy began to slow sharply at the turn of the decade, with the aviation industry becoming one of the sectors to be worst hit, Mallya's fortunes nosedived too.
   
After selling the liquor business to Diageo in a bid to shore up his airline, Mallya looked on helplessly as Kingfisher continued to haemorrhage cash. The airline never took to the skies again after a pilots' strike over unpaid wages in 2012.
   
Having run out of patience over Mallya's failure to clear debts said to be in excess of $60 million, the United Bank of India this month declared him a "wilful defaulter", making it nigh impossible to access fresh loans.
   
While Mallya is fighting to keep his properties from creditors, Roy is trying to sell his portfolio of luxury hotels -- including New York's Plaza Hotel and the Grosvenor House in London -- to raise the $1.6 billion he needs to secure bail from Delhi's Tihar Prison.
Roy was detained after failing to meet a demand by regulators to pay back millions of small savers the $3.2 billion that Sahara raised via an illegal bond scheme. (File Photo)
   
While he has several media interests, including a Hindi TV channel and newspaper, Roy's profile was heightened by his co-ownership with Mallya of Force India and involvement in cricket.
   
As well as sponsoring the national side, Sahara set up a Pune-based franchise to enter the glitzy Indian Premier League (IPL).
   
The team's expulsion from the IPL at the end of last year's tournament in a dispute over finances hinted that all was not well.
   
Things dramatically worsened in March when Roy was detained after failing to meet a demand by regulators to pay back millions of small savers the $3.2 billion that Sahara raised via an illegal bond scheme.
   
Palatial splendour
    
While Roy owns homes modelled on the White House and Buckingham Palace, Reddy's penchant is for luxury cars with a fleet which reportedly included a Rolls Royce Phantom.
   
He also couldn't resist the glamour of the IPL, buying the Deccan Chargers franchise before it went bust in 2012.
   
While Roy's fortune was self-made, Reddy and his brother T. Vinayak Ravi Reddy inherited the ownership of the Deccan Chronicle from their father.
   
The Hyderabad newspaper's prestige enabled them to draw loans for riskier ventures including a chain of bookstores and a chartered jet company.

Even if the cricket team is no longer sucking money, the Reddys are struggling to keep the wolf from the door and lenders have already seized several of their properties.
   
Tamal Bandyopadhyay, author of a book on Sahara, said a weak regulatory framework enabled tycoons to build up debts that should never have been allowed.
   
"Mallya is a case of over-stretching and over-leveraging, while Roy is the case of exploiting regulatory arbitrage or the loopholes in regulation," Bandyopadhyay told AFP.
   
Utagi, a retired bank worker who is vice president of the All India Bank Employees' Association, said there were too many "pliable people" in the industry who face little comeback if money they lend is not repaid.
   
"When it comes to credit appraisals for corporates, the rules are more often honoured in the breach than the observance," he said.
   
Bandyopadhyay said the ambitions of Indian tycoons were rarely held in check as they were "surrounded by sycophants".
   

Round 2 in Android One war: New phones may hit market by December-endSundar Pichai at Android One Launch in New Delhi. Source: PTI Photo
PTI | New Delhi | Posted: September 21, 2014 8:13 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 7:29 pm
Enthused by the initial response to Google’s Android One, handset makers Karbonn, Spice and Intex are gearing up for round two with a slew of smartphone launches beginning December this year.
The first set of Android One devices were launched last week, priced Rs 6,399 onwards by Micromax, Karbonn and Spice.
Karbonn is expected to be among the first ones to launch newer Android One devices in the country.
“Smartphone penetration in India still remains low and we believe there is still a huge scope…We will look at bringing in a device by December-end,” Karbonn Mobiles Executive Director Shashin Devsare told PTI.
India is the first country where the US-based firm’s Android One devices have been launched.
Similarly, Spice is also looking at unveiling its second Android One smartphone in the January-March quarter of next year, its Chairman and Group CEO Dilip Modi said.
“Our intent is to offer consumers a wide variety of products packed with features across various price points. We already have one of the most affordable smartphones with Firefox and we will continue to bring affordable devices to the market,” he added.
Google is rolling out the programme, which aims to bring affordable smartphone to the masses, across other markets like Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka will follow in the coming months.
It has also included new partners including Acer, Alcatal OneTouch, HTC, Asus and Lenovo, along with Indian brands like Xolo, Lava and Intex to bring in devices with various specifications across price points.
By associating with Google as part of the Android one ecosystem, Intex will offer customers an enhanced experience,
something unique in terms of design, pricing and functionality, Intex Business Head (Mobile) Sanjay Kalirona said.
“We are actively working on bringing out the device to the market. It takes about 3-4 months for any final product to be made available in the market,” Kalirona said but declined to comment on when the device would hit the market.
However, sources said Intex could unveil its device by January next year.
Analysts feel Android One will lead a fiercer competition in the mid-range smartphone market with firms offering better experience at price points in the range of Rs 6,000-10,000.
While the initial launch of the Android One handsets was done in partnership with eCommerce firms Snapdeal, Amazon and Flipkart, the handset makers would sell them through brick and mortar stores as well, which will further fuel competition.
According to research firm IDC, Micromax, Karbonn and Lava (top 5 vendors among total shipment as well as smartphone sales) together accounted for over 30 per cent of the market (in both cases).

Gambhir shines in Kolkata win11th straight win for Kolkata Knight Riders
CLT20, GAME 7—Gambhir's men overcome late stutter to chase down Lahore Lions' 151.

Kolkata Knight Riders 153 for 6 (Gambhir 60, Uthappa 46) beat Lahore Lions 151 for 7 (Shehzad 59, Akmal 40, Narine 3-9) by four wickets
Scorecard and ball-by-ball details
A rare fifty this year for Gambhir
Kolkata Knight Riders' four-wicket victory over Lahore Lions followed the template that has largely been the basis of their 11-game winning run: bowl first to allow Sunil Narine and the other spinners to smother the opposition, before Robin Uthappa and the rest of the top order click to set up the chase of a lightweight target.
This match was blighted by abysmal fielding. The number of catches put down, stumpings missed and regulation stops messed up was astonishing. Narine, though, turned in another world-class performance that underlined his reputation as the best in the Twenty20 business, and 19-year-old chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav added to the buzz about him with a stirring effort to stifle Lions.
Narine: another match-winning spell. Lions' best phase of the game was the opening Powerplay, when Ahmed Shehzad struck some big hits down the ground to push the score to 47 for 0. This despite Narine bowling a maiden in the fifth over. A stunning direct hit from Andre Russell broke the opening stand in the seventh over, by when the wicketkeeper Manvinder Bisla had already mucked up two straightforward stumpings.
The Knight Riders' spinners took charge in the middle overs, with Kuldeep showing solid control for a wrist-spinner, getting his stock ball to turn plenty and using the wrong 'un to confuse the batsmen. Mohammad Hafeez spent much of his short innings trying to heave the ball to midwicket before he became Kuldeep's first victim, holing out for 9.
When Shehzad found Uthappa at long-off in the 13th over to finish on a chancy 59, Lions' top-heavy batting was in trouble, especially with three Narine overs to come. The trepidation of the lesser lights in the batting line-up was obvious when they faced Narine: Saad Nasim missed his first ball and edged his second to short cover, Umar Siddiq lasted one more before being done in by the quicker one, and Asif Raza was bowled first ball. Narine nearly had a hat-trick, but Wahab Riaz had his boot back in the crease before Bisla could break the stumps.
Umar Akmal was still there, though, and he clobbered Piyush Chawla and Pat Cummins to lift Lions past 150.
Gautam Gambhir and Uthappa, aided by some comically inept fielding, put on a century stand to set Knight Riders on course for victory. They were coasting for a large part of the chase before a slew of wickets towards the end briefly made things tight, only for Suryakumar Yadav to finish it off with a five-ball 14.

The World s Leaders Are Failing To Curb Corruption. Here s Why.reddit
Rogue current and former dictators and global bribe-paying giant corporations are enjoying levels of impunity, placing them seemingly above the law, which only encourage international corruption and money laundering. The Group of 20 -- the forum of the leaders of the world's most powerful economies -- meets at summit level in November and needs to use this event to forcefully declare "NO IMPUNITY."
It is encouraging that the G20 is gradually moving in this direction. In this context, actions were agreed in advance of the meeting of finance ministers of the Group of 20 in Australia on September 19 and 20 to end the tax practices of companies like Apple , Amazon and Starbucks
that evaded high rates in countries where they have huge markets by registering their businesses in low business tax countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. These tax approaches have been legal, but they prompted public outrage . The politicians felt the heat and have started to take measures.
But, the G20 needs to go much further. It should build on its anti-tax avoidance initiative to take on the crooks by strengthening the G20's existing "Anti-Corruption Action Plan ." President Obama and the other world leaders, when they hold their summit on November 15 in Brisbane, Australia, should focus on the grand corruption that involves vast sums being stolen, ultimately, from citizens across the world.
Let us just look at a few of the major cases that need to be addressed, from the plunder by the current ruler of Sudan, to the vast theft by the former president of Ukraine, to the activities of one of the world's biggest banks, as well as possibly vast international bribe-paying by the world's biggest retail corporation. These cases are just the tip of the iceberg of political and corporate corruption that demands G20 action.
Example: BNP Paribas , France's largest bank. In early July it pleaded guilty to U.S. Justice Department charges and paid a $8.9 billion fine (the largest ever for money laundering) for violating U.S. sanctions on Sudan, Cuba and Iran. The Justice Department stated that the bank had taken deposits over many years from these countries into its Geneva office and then changed the identities of the account holders so that they could illegally acquire U.S. dollar investments.
The charges indicated that billions of dollars were laundered for Sudan and that means the accounts of Sudan's dictator Omar al-Bashir and his cronies. Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court for massive human rights crimes directly related to the slaughter of thousands of people in Dafur.
Several years ago, Wikileaks, according to The Guardian newspaper, revealed that the Sudanese leader had "siphoned as much as $9 billion out of his impoverished country, and much of it may be stashed in London banks."
There is no evidence that U.K. authorities have investigated these allegations. There is no evidence that BNP Paribas is no longer serving as Sudan's banker or that the French authorities care. No top banker at BNP, or, for that matter, any of the major banks caught by the U.S. Justice Department for money laundering and sanctions violations, have been hauled into court and prosecuted.
Example: former Ukraine president Viktor Yanukovych. Ukrainians where aghast when Yanukovych was forced out of office in February to see the incredible riches of his gold-plated mansion in Kiev. Politicians claimed he had stolen at least $20 billion and perhaps double or triple that sum. Immediately, Swiss and Austrian authorities announced they were blocking bank accounts in their countries belonging to the dictator. In June, the Ukraine authorities announced they were investigating the links of two domestic banks to the former leader.
However, the Austrian and Swiss authorities have not revealed which banks held the stolen cash or how large the assets are that are frozen and whether they will be returning the money to the people of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the dictator or his cronies who have the foreign assets, which were almost certainly laundered through holding companies in countries like Cyprus, Liechtenstein and the Cayman Islands to hide the real owners of the accounts, have been pressured to reveal where the stolen money is.
The vast funds stolen by corrupt leaders, like Yanukovych, or the former dictators of Egypt (President Mubarek) and Tunisia (President Ben-Ami) have not been seized by Western authorities and returned to their rightful owners -- the citizens of their countries. The G20 needs to act to close the money laundering havens and ensure asset repatriation.
Example: Walmart, the world's largest retailer. In March, the company announced that over the previous two years it had spent $439 million conducting internal investigations of bribing foreign government officials in Mexico, China, India and Brazil. It was not the U.S. Justice Department that prompted Walmart to become alarmed. It was an investigation the New York Times in 2012.
There are many other cases of international corruption where the justice departments of G20 governments have either turned a blind eye or done very little. Challenging this complacency is a brand new global campaign launched by the anti-corruption organization, Transparency International, which is called: " Unmask the Corrupt ." It seeks to expose the corrupt villains -- individuals and corporations -- as well as the schemes they use to launder their cash and, as a result, buy yachts harbored in the South of France, mansions in London, Manhattan and Beverly Hills and the world's most valuable works of art.
It is now time for the G20 to do some unmasking. It needs to use its summit meeting and put an end to the impunity that is so widespread.

Uneasy questions after Amit Shah visits Gorta  village with violent pastUneasy questions after Amit Shah visits Gorta, village with violent past
Sudipto Mondal , Hindustan Times  Gorta, Bidar, September 22, 2014
First Published: 08:30 IST(22/9/2014) | Last Updated: 16:17 IST(22/9/2014)
Comments
This village of around 2,000 voters on the Maharashtra-Karnataka border is apparently unremarkable, but BJP president Amit Shah chose this as his destination when he came calling on September 17.
Shah laid the foundation for a 35-foot statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and left with the promise that he would return exactly a year later with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the inauguration.
The answers to his choice of venue lie in history.
In the last two decades, September 17 and Gorta have become mustering points for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Hindu activists in the districts of Karnataka that were under the erstwhile Nizam of Hyderabad.
It was on September 17, 1948, that the Indian Army, sent by Patel, annexed Hyderabad and defeated the private militia of the Nizam called the Razakars.
Gorta is where a resistance group of local Lingayat zamindars suffered heavy losses in a battle against Razakars on May 5 and 6, 1948.
After the battle of Gorta, Muslim inhabitants were driven away, says gram panchayat development officer BS Chincholi.
The lines drawn then still stand. Panchayat member Rajkumar Maitri says, “The landholding Ligayat satraps maintain a ban on the entry of Muslims into the village to this day. Muslims are not allowed to work on the farms or in anywhere in the village.”
Gorta has never truly been far from the saffron sight. BJP patriarch LK Advani unveiled a statue of Patel at Gulbarga, adjoining Bidar district, in 1998.
The ceremony was to happen on September 17 but the installation triggered communal tension and finally happened a month later under tight security.
The same year, Hindutva icon Pramod Muthalik started a campaign for the installation of a similar monument at Gorta and gave the village the title of “Jallianwala Bagh of the South”.
Muthalik’s call, however, did not gain momentum and Gorta receded back into the shadows until the BJP Yuva Morcha focused attention on the village in April this year.
Shah described his visit to this remote village as an initiative to “introduce the young generation” to the history of the region which “would have become Pakistan if it weren’t for Patel”. But the history Shah referred to is a bitterly contested one.
As he was delivering his speech before nearly 20,000 supporters from all over north Karnataka, small Dalit and progressive groups held demonstrations in different parts of the region accusing Shah and the BJP of playing communal politics and “rewriting history”.

Dalit leader Vijanath Suryavanshi, who led one such demonstration in Bidar, says, “This is the land of Basava and Sufi saints who fought against the twin evils of caste and communalism.”
According to him, right-wing Hindu activists have been trying for the last 20 years to revive one, highly polarising version of the region’s history. “Their campaign has become very strong in the last three or four years.”
Although Shah did not make any overtly provocative statements in his speech, the gathering was marked by aggressive behaviour. In addition to anti-Pakistan slogans, groups of activists headed for the venue chanted provocative limericks in which they pledged to turn every village into Gorta.
Waiting for Shah’s chopper to arrive, many young activists huddled around elderly men wearing bright turbans who were witness to the happenings of 1948.
Parasuram Ekalar, 74, from neighbouring Godwadi village, bragged about how his father killed three persons from a family to avenge the atrocities of the Razakars.

The story of Gorta, says Kannada writer K Neela, is like any from the partition era, when thousands of Muslims and Hindus were killed in a cycle of violence and counter-violence.
Neela, who led a demonstration in Gulbarga against Shah’s visit, says, “Erecting a memorial that represents only one side of the story is a clear attempt to polarise society and reopen old wounds.”
For activists such as Neela and Suryavanshi, the recently declassified Pandit Sundarlal Commission (commission sent by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru after reports of large-scale violence) report has become an important tool.
The December 1948 report, which was first accessed by historian AG Noorani in 2001 and became public in 2013, notes that around 50,000 Muslims were killed in the erstwhile princely state to avenge the atrocities of the Razakars.
Karnataka BJP Yuva Morcha chief P Muniraju Gowda bristles at the mention of the massacres after the Razakars were defeated. “If the pseudo secular people are interested, let them make a memorial for those people. Our memorial is for people who fought for the country, not traitors,” he says.
85-year-old Vittal Rao, a landless Dalit from Gorta, lost his father Gundappa Kesari, uncle Narasingh Rao and relatives Madhava and Lakshman Kesari in the 1948 battle.
He wasn’t among the people at Shah’s meeting, neither were other Dalits. The 300 Dalits in the village were ordered to stay off the venue by Lingayat landlords.
“They don’t like our version of history,” says Rao.
“We were attacked by both the landlords and the Razakars. The local Lingayat landlords fought the Razakars because they wanted to protect their land. We had no land so we did not join either side. The Lingayats attacked us calling us traitors and the Razakars attacked us because we were not Muslim,” he says.

No one is sure how many villagers died in the fighting. While Rao says around 12 to 15 people died, local Lingayat leader Neelakanthappa Patil, 82, points to a plaque in the gram panchayat office that lists 20 names.
A press note circulated by the BJP, however, says, “Hundreds were martyred in a single day. The scene was so pathetic that there was no single person (sic) to perform the last rites.”
As competing narratives of a 66-year-old story swirl around, Dalits in Gorta try to draw attention to the more immediate issue of their life and livelihood. “Our houses and our convention hall were damaged in 2009 floods. Nobody wants to repair that,” says Rajendra Kesari, 35.

Fellow Dalit Shrimanth Shinde says, “We are not allowed into barber shops, hotels and temples to this day. Will Narendra Modi solve our issues when he comes next year?”
The Dalits in the village started a series of agitations against untouchability in 2010. It got wide coverage in the local media. Community leaders say they plan to submit a memorandum to the PM when he comes next year, as promised by Shah.

Dolphins  Super Kings look to overcome shaky startMore
Dolphins, Super Kings look to overcome shaky start
With losses in their opening games, Dolphins and Super Kings find themselves with a set of similar challenges.
By The Preview by Rachna Shetty | ESPNcricinfo –  Sun 21 Sep, 2014 5:30 AM IST
Start time 2000 local (1430 GMT)
Big picture
On most days, having reduced the opposition to 51 for 5, Chennai Super Kings would have backed themselves to canter to a win. Against Kolkata Knight Riders in their opening game of the Champions League T20, however, Super Kings' early advantage, built up by Ashish Nehra 's strikes, faded against the blitz from Andre Russell and Ryan ten Doeschate .
MS Dhoni later put down the loss to the fact that his team did not have enough runs on the board. There were a few close decisions that went against Super Kings, but the top order was also effectively stifled by the Knight Riders' spin attack. Against Dolphins, the top order will be tested again, this time by the South African franchise's pacers Kyle Abbott, Craig Alexander and Robbie Frylinck. The trio tied down Perth Scorchers in the Powerplay, giving away just 32 runs in six overs, but they will find themselves faced with a tougher challenge when they run in to bowl against Brendon McCullum and Dwayne Smith , who are part of one of the stronger batting line-ups of the IPL. Super Kings will hope their top order can set a better platform for a big finish.

Apart from needing their top orders to fire, both teams also need their bowlers to maintain pressure after a few tight overs and quick wickets. Against Scorchers, Dolphins gave away 49 runs in the five overs following the Powerplay. Super Kings' spinners R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja struggled against Knight Riders and the five overs they bowled between them cost 54 runs, giving a struggling chase second wind. Against Scorchers, the Dolphins batsmen showed an ability to come back hard at the bowling and it will be important for Super Kings to apply pressure throughout to avoid another surprise charge.
The track at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore is known for being well-suited to batting and that trend may continue during Monday's game as well. The teams will also have to factor in a chance of rain in the evening.

As captain of the side, one of its senior-most batsmen and one half of one of the franchise's more successful opening partnerships, Morne van Wyk carries the responsibility of being an important player for Dolphins. Equally important for the side is his knowledge of subcontinent conditions gathered from his time with the South Africa team during the 2011 World Cup and during a season of the IPL for Knight Riders.
His return to the Super Kings side after having spent most of IPL 2014 sidelined by injury showed why Dwayne Bravo is one of the core members of the team. As a batsman, he switched gears, along with MS Dhoni, to push the total past 150 and with the ball, he sent down a few quiet overs. Bravo did not have a great Caribbean Premier League for Trinidad & Tobago Red Steel, but his early form in the Champions League has looked good.

It s working! Isro successfully test-fires Mangalyaan engineSet for date with Mars, Mangalyaan in 'good health'
Vanita Srivastava , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 22, 2014
First Published: 15:50 IST(22/9/2014) | Last Updated: 05:26 IST(24/9/2014)
Indian scientists on Monday successfully tested the main engine of the country’s Mars mission spacecraft and completed a course correction that put the probe on track to enter the red planet’s orbit on September 24.
 
If successful, India will become the first country to make it to Mars in its maiden attempt, propelling it to an elite club of space race leaders. Only the US, Europe and Russia have so far sent probes that have successfully orbited or landed on the planet.
“We had a perfect burn for four seconds as programmed. The trajectory has been corrected. MOM (Mars Orbiter Mission) will now go for the nominal plan for Mars Orbit Insertion,” the Indian Space Research Organisation’s Facebook page said.
 
The liquid engine, which was dormant for 300 days, will be used with eight small thrusters during orbit entry by the spacecraft in India’s first interplanetary mission.
 
“The spacecraft is in good health. Mission controllers are going through the final round of the sequence of operations,” ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan told HT, adding that there was a lot more to do.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be at Isro’s command centre in Bengaluru at 7.30am on September 24 to witness the mission’s last phase after the probe broke into Mars’ sphere of influence on Monday.

The Mangalyaan, as the spacecraft is popularly known, aims to study Mars' surface and mineral composition, and search its atmosphere for methane, a chemical strongly tied to life on earth.

India’s Rs. 450-crore expedition cost about a tenth of Nasa’s Mars mission Maven that entered the red planet’s orbit on Wednesday. Modi hailed the project’s low price tag in June, saying it was less than the budget of the Hollywood space movie Gravity.
 
“I hope India will consider international participation in any future missions to Mars as this mission will clearly demonstrate its capability to successfully deliver a payload to Mars and many countries would be pleased to collaborate with India,” said Mark Sims, professor of astrobiology and space instrumentation at the UK’s University of Leicester.
 
The 680-million-kilometre journey to Mars that began on November 5 last year has had its share of adventures and feats —five orbit-raising manoeuvres including a small glitch in the fourth such operation that was fixed.
 
Probes to Mars have a high failure rate and a success will boost India’s space exploration programme, especially after a similar mission by China failed to leave earth’s orbit in 2011.

In Washington, politicians seem to fall into one of two camps on climate change. Some believe we need to act quickly to reduce America’s greenhouse gas emissions. Others believe the cost of reducing those emissions will hurt the economy.
As an entrepreneur and investor, I see it differently.
I previously led the innovation and strategy team at Redbox, the company that owns those red automated movie kiosks you see at your local grocery store, pharmacy, or fast food restaurant. My job was to find new ways to grow the business and better serve our customers.
With a sophisticated supply chain, we grew the business from a few hundred locations to more than 35,000 locations in about 10 years. With this many locations, it’s critical to carefully coordinate how field reps move from one kiosk to another to restock new titles.
With these exact logistics, however, we were vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This is especially true because many of our kiosks are located outdoors. Severe weather—extreme temperatures, floods, or unusually strong hurricanes—impacted business in a measureable way. Sometimes, it kept customers away. It often prevented field reps from restocking kiosks. Floods and storms also damaged kiosks and the inventory inside. In fact, Hurricane Katrina destroyed over 100 kiosks across the Gulf Coast.
Katrina made us much more aware of how climate change affected our business. The company started looking for ways to become more sustainable. One of the areas in which we had the most success was route optimization.
We aimed to reduce fuel consumption and time spent on the road by finding the most efficient routes for our field reps to travel between stops. We minimized the number of left-hand turns drivers took and accounted for traffic patterns and stop lights. As a result, the drivers used less gasoline and spent less time on the road. The savings on fuel, labor, and trucks were substantial. And by tightening up the supply chain, severe weather events impacted smaller service areas, creating additional savings for the company’s bottom line.
Smart investments in sustainability measures can pay substantial dividends over time. Likewise, business leaders looking for cost savings may implement efficiency measures that help the environment too. Innovating company practices can create many indirect benefits.
Policymakers could learn from this lesson as well. The EPA has issued new draft standards that will require power plants to reduce their carbon emissions, and each state is free to develop its own plan to meet them. If state officials, utility companies and local business leaders work together to come up with a smart, innovative plan, we can reduce our long-term energy costs, improve energy reliability, and become more competitive than those who stick to business as usual.

Chrysler recalls 230 760 SUVs for fuel pump ...Chrysler recalls 230,760 SUVs globally for fuel pump issue

ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
DETROIT: Chrysler Group is recalling an estimated 230,760 sport utility vehicles globally to install a new part to prevent a fuel pump issue that could cause the vehicles to stall or not start.
Chrysler, a unit of Fiat, said it had discovered in an internal review that some fuel-pump relays in certain 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs were susceptible to deformation.
The automaker said it was unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue.
The fuel-pump relay is inside an integrated power module that helps manage other vehicle function, but none of those other functions are affected, Chrysler said.
The recall covers an estimated 188,723 SUVs sold in the United States, 15,898 in Canada, 7,126 in Mexico and 19,013 outside of North America, the company said.
Chrysler said it would advise customers when they can schedule service.

What s next for markets: Watch cars  homes  jobsInvestors get a clue from cars, homes and jobs

How’s the economy really doing? Investors find out this week by watching three things: cars, houses and jobs.
Investors looking for new datapoints on the economy will get them this week, if they know where to look. Two big companies connected with the auto industry report profit. Car parts seller Autozone (AZO) reports on Monday. Analysts are calling for 8% growth. Perhaps more telling will be car seller Carmax (KMX) on Tuesday. Consumers buy cars when they’re feeling confident. Analysts see earnings up 8%
Confident consumers buy cars, and houses. Homebuilder KB Home (KBH) reports Wednesday. Analysts want to see 46% higher profit. Investors will be looking for clues about a stronger housing market. Existing home sales data are also due out Monday.
Car and home sales are powered by jobs. And there’s data this week on that, too. Payroll processor Paychex (PCX) reports on Wednesday. More paystubs means more jobs. Earnings are expected to be up 4.5%. But what’s more important is what Paychex sees in hiring trends.
True, $200 sneakers aren’t as important as homes or cars. But Nike’s (NKE) earnings report is useful – especially when it comes to gauging global demand. The company is reporting Thursday. Analysts see profit inching up just 2.3%. But investors will want to hear about what Nike is seeing from other parts of the world, including China.
There’s also GDP data. But investors know to watch cars, houses and jobs.

Youths claiming to be Varuns supporters protest outside BJPMPshousePrint
PTI | Allahabad | Posted: September 22, 2014 6:13 pm
A group of youths, claiming to be supporters of BJP leader Varun Gandhi, on Monday staged a protest in front of the house of local MP Shyama Charan Gupta here over the latter’s reported statement wherein he had criticised the party’s former national general secretary and his mother and Union Minister Maneka Gandhi.
The incident took place around noon when nearly a dozen youths gathered in front of the house of Gupta, and burnt the effigy of the industrialist-turned-politician who had joined the BJP and won a party ticket barely a month before the Allahabad Lok Sabha constituency went to polls.
The protesters, who were carrying the party flag, termed Gupta as an “outsider” alluding to his long association with Samajwadi Party and condemned his statement made on Saturday wherein he had criticised Maneka for trying to project her son as a potential chief ministerial candidate for Uttar Pradesh.
They also tore apart a huge banner put up alongside Gupta’s palatial residence.
Gupta had, reacting to the BJP’s debacle in the recent bypolls, reportedly said that Maneka had caused harm to the party by coming out in the open with the demand for a bigger role for her son who was removed from the post of national general secretary after Amit Shah took over as BJP president.
Meanwhile, reacting to the incident, city BJP president Shashi Varshney said “prima facie it seems to be the handiwork of hooligans who are not our full-time workers and who had merely carried the party flag to create mischief”.
“I am at present in Lucknow. Nevertheless, upon returning to Allahabad I would seek a detailed report and if any party worker is found directly or indirectly involved, proper disciplinary action would follow,” Varshney told

Smart cities  to be identified before Budge...budget
(The government is currently…)
MUMBAI: The Centre will start identifying urban areas which can be transformed into "smart cities", before the Budget , Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu said here today.
The government is currently holding consultations with all stakeholders including state governments, local bodies and those keen on developing smart cities.
"I have held consultation with my state counterparts and taken them into confidence. Now we are at the advance stage of finalising the contours of the smart cities and by November we expect the process to be completed...and expect to identify the cities before the Budget," Naidu, who was in town today for the Ieema annual convention, told reporters.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has envisaged developing 100 smart cities by 2022. The Finance Ministry has allocated Rs 7,060 crore for developing these cities as well, which will replace the present flagship urban renewal scheme JNNURM.
"I am planning to complete the process of consultation and finalisation of the contours by end of November and take them to the Expenditure Finance Committee and then to Cabinet. Then from the beginning of the year, roll out will begin," he said.
"We plan to have at least 2-3 smart cities in each state," he said.
Emphasising the need for taking all the stakeholders on board, he said, "You have to take the states and urban local bodies into confidence. Then you need support from different sectors and you need finances, which need a lot of consultations. We have finalised PPP model for developing smart cities."
Naidu further said there is an increased interest from other countries to participate in this project. "I have held consultations with a lot of foreign delegations who are interested in participating in this project. Japan is keen to cooperate to transform Varanasi into a smart city. Similarly, a former Singaporean Prime Minister has also met me and expressed interest in constructing a new capital for Andhra, which I want to make into a smart city," he said.
He said he will visit cities like Oklahoma and Seoul to understand their models.
However, he noted that creating a smart city is not an easy task. "It is not easy to construct a smart city overnight without light and basic amenities. We need to prepare habitat with a smart leadership. Further, there is a need to provide facilities for transport, water, disposal of waste, traffic security management, education, entertainment and employment opportunities, among others. All these things will take time," he said.
"In this entire process, having 24x7 power supply will be critical. A city cannot be smart if there is no power. Therefore, there is a need to create proper transmission and distribution system to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity," Naidu added.

Differing perceptions  over LAC: Chinese mi...China-India border
("We can say President Xi's…)
BEIJING: Amid the continuing standoff with Indian troops in the Ladakh region, the Chinese military today for the first time commented on the recent border incidents, saying there are "differing perceptions" of the LAC but the two sides can resolve boundary issues through dialogue.
"We have noted the relevant media reports," the office of the spokesman of China's Ministry of National Defence said in response to a query from PTI here about the standoff between the troops of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and that of India in Chumar area of Ladakh which has been continuing for over a week.
"The China-India boundary dispute is an issue left over from history. The boundary between the two countries has not been demarcated till now and there are differing perceptions with regards to the Line of Actual Control (LAC)," military said in its first comments on the incident which cast a shadow over President Xi Jinping's high-profile visit to India.
"The border troops of China have always strictly observed the relevant agreements signed between the two countries. The two sides can properly resolve issues arising in the border areas through dialogue and consultations," it said.
The Chinese military referred to the joint statement issued at the end of Xi's visit, stating that the two countries wished to build a closer developmental partnership recognising peace and tranquility on the China-India border areas as an important guarantor for the development and continued growth of bilateral relations.
"They (Xi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi ) also reiterated that pending a final resolution of the boundary question, the two sides would continue to make joint efforts to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas," the military said.
"We are willing to work with the Indian side to earnestly implement the important consensus agreed upon by the leaders of the two countries and work together to maintain peace and tranquility in the China-India border areas," the PLA communique said without specifying how to resolve the issue.
Yesterday, Chiefs of staff of the PLA met to improve the efficiency of the military command under new circumstances.
It is not clear whether the border standoff in Ladakh was discussed.
Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing today that President Xi's visit to India removed "some suspicions" between the two countries, pushed the ties to a "new age" and during talks an "important consensus" was reached on politically resolving the border issue through friendly coordination.
"We can say President Xi's visit to India has removed some of the suspicions of two countries and pushed bilateral relations to a new age," Hua said.

GMR signs agreement with Nepal for 900 Mw projectGMR signs agreement with Nepal for 900 Mw project
Mahesh Kulkarni | Bangalore Sep 22, 2014 06:30 PM IST
GMR Group today announced the signing of project development agreement (PDA) for the 900 Mw Upper Karnali Hydro Power Project with the Government of Nepal on September 19, 2014.
This is the largest FDI for Nepal and also the largest investment for GMR Group outside India, the company said in a filing to BSE.
The Upper Karnali Hydro Power Project was awarded to the GMR Group through an international competitive bidding process in 2008 on BOOT basis. The Project is being developed as an export oriented project, to be constructed over a period of 5 years.
The Project is located on Karnali river, in the Surkhet, Dailekh and Achham districts of Nepal. The power generated, net of Free Power and power supply to Nepal, if any, is planned to be evacuated through a 400 Kv double circuit transmission line up to the interconnection point of Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL), in India.
The financial closure of the project (long term tie up of debt and equity capital) is expected to be achieved by September 2016 and thereafter the commencement of the commercial operation is expected by September 2021.
Continuing with its asset light asset right (ALAR) strategy, GMR Group will be exploring strategic / long term capital tie up of both debt and equity for the project at an appropriate time.
The project is expected to generate about 3,500 million units of energy annually and 420 MUs of energy (12% of installed capacity) has been earmarked as free power to Nepal. The Nepal Electricity Authority will hold 27 per cent free equity stake in the project including all project royalties and the 100% ownership of the
project will be transferred to the Government of Nepal, at the end of the 25 year concession period.

Mumbai, Sept 22:  
Gold continued its downtrend at the domestic bullion market here today on reduced demand from retail consumers amid bearish global cues.
Traders attributed the dull demand for the yellow metal to the ongoing ‘shradh’, a period considered inauspicious by Hindus for making fresh purchases.
Silver also slumped due to heavy speculative unwinding with subdued industrial off—take.
Standard gold (99.5 purity) fell by Rs 100 to close at Rs 26,400 per 10 grams from last Saturday’s level of Rs 26,500.
Pure gold (99.9 purity) also declined by a similar margin to conclude at Rs 26,550 per 10 grams as compared to Rs 26,650 previously.
Silver (.999 fineness) plunged by Rs 830 to finish at Rs 39,680 per kg as against Rs 40,510 last weekend.
On the global front, gold slid to its weakest since early January and silver to a four—year low in early trade as speculation that the Federal Reserve will start its rate— tightening cycle sooner than expected fuelled selling of precious metals.
Spot gold was down to $1,214.84 an ounce and spot silver hit its lowest since June 2010 at $17.30 an ounce in early European trade.

HC rejects Haryana s plea against MarutiHC rejects Haryana's plea against Maruti
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Sep 22, 2014 06:42 PM IST
The Delhi High Court today dismissed Haryana's plea challenging its order restraining the state from prosecuting car maker Maruti for not having prior environment clearance (EC) for its unit in Rohtak.
While rejecting the plea of Haryana State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), a bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw observed that the matter was being pursued "to satisfy the ego of some officers" and hoped it will not be pressed further.
"We do not find any merit in the appeal which is dismissed. We refrain from imposing any costs on appellant (Haryana SEIAA) and its officers who have filed this appeal in the hope that the appellants will not press the matter further which appears to being pursued to satisfy the ego of some officers of the appellants," the bench said.
The state had challenged the high court's May 26 order, passed with the consent of both parties, restraining Haryana from initiating proceedings against Maruti for not taking EC prior to setting up its unit in Rohtak.
The order was passed after the Additional Advocate General (AAG) for the state had submitted before a single-judge bench of the high court that it supports an amicable resolution of the disputes.
With the consent of Haryana and Maruti, the high court on May 26 had said that if the legality and validity of the 2006 notification are upheld and Maruti as well as its directors undertake to obtain ex-post facto EC and comply with its terms and conditions for project in Rohtak and all future projects in Haryana, the state would consider not initiating any criminal action against the company for not procuring prior EC with regard to the present project.
Challenging the order, SEIAA, in its plea, had contended that such an amicable settlement was not provided for under the statute in environment matters.
It had also said that the state had given no instructions to the AAG to give a consent.

Three ways to create a productive virtual work environment1
Explain to job candidates and current team members how working remotely will differ from working in an office environment. There are real challenges, and you should be emphasizing them rather than downplaying them. Candidates who know they are not a good fit for a remote environment can opt out of the hiring process.
Establish a system of clear and open communication throughout the organization. Make every employee feel comfortable pitching ideas directly to senior leadership. Whether you decide to use email, instant messaging, the phone, video chat, or a combination of those mediums, it's crucial to establish consistent expectations from the beginning.
Set measurable benchmarks. Team members should meet certain goals throughout the duration of a project, sales cycle, or specific time period.
KNOW YOUR PROCESS INTIMATELY
With a virtual business, it's tempting to bombard your team with emails and telephone calls. Instead of spending your time and energy managing every small detail, focus your efforts on building processes that allow employees to use their time as efficiently as possible.
When leaders create appropriate processes, they have a much better understanding of the steps necessary to produce a given result. If you don't understanding the process, it's far more difficult to fairly evaluate your team members' contributions.
HOW TO MEASURE AND MANAGE PRODUCTIVITY
When you do experience a drop in productivity, as happens from time to time in all companies, it can be difficult to quickly determine the cause. Below are several suggestions to help you avoid and identify potential pitfalls before they negatively impact your bottom line.
Establish a standard protocol. You must have a system for periodically evaluating certain company-specific benchmarks. Attach benchmarks to periods of time or stages in a process — do not simply evaluate final results.
Measure everything. You cannot objectively evaluate business results without having access to quantifiable data. Invest in resources to identify and measure your business' key performance indicators, then track them over time.
Teach. Observe. Review. Show your team what must be done, then observe them doing it independently. Review your findings with team members and explain how they can improve.
Anticipate and plan for declines. Create reward systems, processes and trainings that guide individuals down the most productive path.
Extinguish small fires immediately. Address small issues before they become major crises, and demonstrate to individuals how they can improve before they're underperforming.
While shifting work from the office to a remote setting can be profoundly beneficial for your company, keep in mind that reducing overhead does not mean reducing the amount of guidance, direction and leadership you owe your team.
Virtual businesses require strong, consistent leadership to ensure that both employee growth and productivity remain on track. In some cases, such a company may even demand more from you as a leader. However, with the right processes and the right people in place, going virtual can work wonders for your business.

U.K. markets rally as Scotland says noMarkets rally as Scotland votes to stay
By Mark Thompson   @MarkThompsonCNN September 19, 2014: 6:28 AM ET
LONDON (CNNMoney)
Investors breathed a deep sigh of relief Friday as Scotland voted to stay in the United Kingdom, averting months of turmoil that would have hurt the economy.
Results from the historic referendum showed 55% voted against independence in Thursday's ballot, a clearer margin than expected.
Stock markets rose, with shares in Scottish companies doing particularly well. The FTSE 100 index gained 0.7% in morning trading.
"The risk of huge disruption from Scottish independence is gone. Not for good ... but for a considerable time," noted Robert Wood, chief U.K. economist at Berenberg bank. "For now markets can return to normal.
The pound got an early bounce before slipping back against the U.S. dollar. It was steady against the euro.
The U.K. currency had already rallied this week, recovering much of the ground lost in early September when surveys suggested Scotland was on the brink of ending its 307-year union with England.
Central bank action will again take center stage for currency dealers.
"Markets can refocus on monetary policy divergence, and as the Federal Reserve marches towards the exit from QE ... the dollar will rally," said Kit Juckes, strategist at Societe Generale.

Companies and banks that warned they may migrate south of the border if Scotland broke away were quick to reassure investors and customers that it was business as usual.
"The announcement we made about moving our registered head office to England was part of a contingency plan to ensure certainty and stability for our customers, staff and shareholders should there be a 'Yes' vote," Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) said in a statement. "That contingency plan is no longer required."
Shares in RBS gained 3%.
A vote in favor of independence would have ushered in months, if not years, of difficult divorce proceedings over the currency , North Sea oil , U.K. national debt and Scotland's place in the European Union.
Investors feared that the considerable uncertainty would dent business and consumer confidence, hurt growth, slow job creation and hit tax revenues.
The Scotch Whisky Association had said it was concerned about how potential changes in Scottish tax and trade rules could hurt exports to international markets.
Still, market relief will be tempered by the fact that the U.K. government made big concessions in the last days of the campaign, promising to hand over much more power to the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh.
That in turn has sparked a political backlash in England , the consequences of which are unclear. And with a U.K. election just eight months way -- a vote that could lead to a referendum on EU membership in 2017 -- political risk will remain high for some time to come.
Scotland's decision may ease concerns about disintegration elsewhere in Europe , particularly in Spain where separatists in Catalonia are pushing for their own independence vote in November.
Spain's stock market gained 1% Friday, outperforming other European markets.

Shonda Rhimes Takes Down NY Times Critic Over Offensive Articlereddit
Shonda Rhimes had little patience on Friday for the way the television critic of the New York Times wrote about her and her shows.
Alessandra Stanley—whose tenure at the Times has been filled with many a bump —may have intended to be complimentary when she wrote an article about how Rhimes has changed the landscape for black women on television , but she probably could have chosen a better way to start the piece off this way:
When Shonda Rhimes writes her autobiography, it should be called “How to Get Away With Being an Angry Black Woman.”
On Thursday, Ms. Rhimes will introduce “How to Get Away With Murder,” yet another network series from her production company to showcase a powerful, intimidating black woman.
Come again?
Critics took issue with just about every single aspect of the entire article .
Rhimes, though, zeroed right in on that lede:
Confused why @nytimes critic doesn't know identity of CREATOR of show she's reviewing. @petenowa did u know u were "an angry black woman"?

From the Boston bombings to Hannah Graham: How Internet sleuths help (and hurt) police investigationsBy Caitlin Dewey September 19 Follow @caitlindewey

In the week since 18-year-old University of Virginia sophomore Hannah Graham mysteriously disappeared while walking home late at night, police have canvassed her neighborhood and interviewed her friends. Her parents have called for the Fairfax County native’s safe return. Her classmates have massed and mourned.
And amateur Internet sleuths, never ones to miss out on public tragedy, have taken some action of their own: watching and rewatching online surveillance videos, creating maps of Graham’s every suspected move … and gradually coming up with a few original theories.
Charlottesville police released surveillance video of 18-year-old University of Virginia student Hannah Graham walking near Sal's Pizza in the early morning before she disappeared Sep.13. (Charlottesville Police)
“I believe Hannah was taken into the garage,” proffered one man on Facebook . “I highly think the older man and the dreaded head man are in this together.”
“Let police know the second man is in this tape,” another guy writes on YouTube . “Black big dude with dreads clearly following her.”
“It is entirely possible” that Graham’s disappearance is linked to other local disappearances, one Redditor writes in a forum dedicated to discussing serial killers. “Besides being female and missing, what other similarities are there that the victims share? Age, race, profession, etc.?”
This is, for better or worse, what a high-profile crime investigation looks like in 2014: constant media hype, breathless real-time “analysis” and veritable Everests of Internet speculation. The story has repeated enough times, in fact, that it’s no longer a novelty. Whenever police release surveillance photos or videos to the public, they can count on the Internet to edit, squint at and otherwise overthink them — generating hundreds of theories and tip-line calls in the process.
Just days ago an anonymous Twitter sleuth earned the praise of Philadelphia — and its police department — when he identified several suspects in a brutal hate crime. Using Facebook’s Graph Search function and tips from other Twitterati, the account @FanSince09 discovered not only clear pictures of all the suspects, but the names of several in the group.
Pretty confident I have at least 3 positive IDs.
— FanSince09 (@FanSince09) September 17, 2014
“This is how Twitter is supposed to work for cops,” detective Joseph Murray tweeted. “This is what makes my job easy.”
But often, of course, social media doesn’t work that way — and while cases like the one in Philadelphia have emboldened and encouraged Internet sleuths, their actual record is spotty. In April of last year, a group of well-intentioned Redditors in the forum r/bostonbombings compiled thousands of videos from the scene of the Boston Marathon bombing, studying them for suspicious backpacks and bystanders.
“It’s been proven that a crowd of thousands can do things like this much quicker and better,” the forum’s moderator wrote at one point. “I’d take thousands of people over a select few very smart investigators any day.”
Except that every “suspect” the forum identified was wrong — complicating the actual FBI investigation  and damaging the reputations of several innocent people. When Redditors attempted to launch a similar forum six months later, this one tied to the Navy Yard shootings, site administrators promptly shut it down .
The hacktivist collective Anonymous has likewise become notorious for its attempts to “seek justice” in a number of national cases — but to Anonymous, “justice” has frequently meant poorly researched, vigilante-style revenge. The group correctly identified a number of high-schoolers involved in Steubenville’s infamous rape case and surfaced critical photos and videos from the scene. But when Ferguson, Mo., police failed to immediately release the name of the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, Anonymous hackers released his name — and address, and Social Security number — themselves.
They had the wrong guy .
This doesn’t mean that crowd-sourced sleuthing is necessarily bad or that law enforcement should discourage it. On the contrary, in cases like Graham’s disappearance, police are often hoping to reach as many potential witnesses and tipsters as possible, and the efforts of 20,000 avid Facebook users can only help get their message out. The last “major break” in the case , in fact, came from public tips: Multiple callers drew police to a condo, and a car, in an apartment complex off the U.Va. campus.
Hannah Elizabeth Graham went missing in Charlottesville last week. (Charlottesville Police)
This, in fact, may be the critical red line between “good” Internet sleuths and “bad”: The former work to help actual investigators; the latter want to be the investigators, themselves. It’s a subtle bit of hubris that explains the yawning ethical and efficacy chasm between calling a tip in to police, say, and calling the suspect or witness directly.
DON’T BE STUPID AND CALL THE RESTAURANT IF YOU ARE NOT THE POLICE
— FanSince09 (@FanSince09) September 17, 2014
In Hannah Graham’s case, it may be the difference between sharing police updates and news releases, and engaging in long, unqualified analyses of the same. Even as I write this, armchair detectives on Facebook and YouTube are demanding to know why police haven’t arrested the “dreads guy” — a man with dreadlocks seen in two surveillance videos who was conclusively ruled out as a suspect.
“I really believe this to be the man they are looking for,” one woman posted on Facebook with a surveillance still of the “dreads guy.”
“I just don’t think there’s a way to tell from the video,” another man replied. “We’ll know that when the police tell us.”
It’s good advice, not only in this case but in most freelance investigations that Internet sleuths get into.

Five Questions To Help Choose The Best Student Loan For YouBy Michael Taormina , CommonBond
I recently laid out some key considerations for thinking through a fixed rate vs. a variable rate student loan option ( "Is a variable rate loan right for me?" ). Ultimately, a borrower's unique individual circumstances, in light of those considerations, determine which option makes more sense. The same is true for choosing a repayment term length, and this post asks five key questions to help a borrower arrive at the best repayment term for his or her specific financial situation.
1) First, why does the length of the loan repayment term even matter?
If you're like me, you want to pay off your student debt as quickly as humanly possible -- while also prudently taking into account any other competing financial goals (retirement, vacations, buying a house, etc.) as well as the level of disposable income and savings you have on hand to pay your debt off.
Your loan's repayment term affects these competing interests because it directly impacts the size of your monthly scheduled loan payment -- the amount of cash you need to set aside each month to stay current on your loan. For example, let's assume you are looking to refinance $100,000 in student loans and are weighing three different repayment term options. (I use $100,000 both for "easy numbers" and because there are a good number of students graduating with this much debt!) For simplicity's sake, we'll keep the interest rate the same across all options to isolate the effect of extending the loan repayment term.
Here is what your monthly payment will look like for a loan with a 5-, 10-, and 15-year repayment term, respectively:
Monthly Loan Payment for Different Repayment Terms
*assumes uniform interest rate
Bottom line: the choice of repayment term directly impacts the amount of cash you'll need to set aside each month to make your monthly student loan payment and also determines how long you'll be paying back your student loans. A longer repayment period reduces your monthly loan payment, all else equal.
2) How does repayment term affect the interest rate you're charged?
The example above assumed the same interest rate for each repayment term, but in reality, the interest rate will be different for each repayment option. If you want to borrow money for a longer period of time, all else equal, the interest rate will typically be higher to compensate the lender for the added uncertainty from providing funds for a longer period of time.
So let's incorporate that reality into the example by simply assuming a 5 percent fixed rate for a 5-year and a 7 percent fixed rate for a 15-year loan:
The Effect of Higher Interest Rates
Bottom line: a longer repayment term reduces a borrower's monthly loan payment, but that benefit comes at the cost of a higher interest rate.
3) What are other tradeoffs to consider in choosing a repayment term?
On the face of it, the 15-year term appears to be the clear winner. You pay the least per month, and therefore free up cash for other expenses and financial goals. However, while that's true, the payment is only lower because you are repaying less principal today... and delaying the repayment of that principal into the future.
In other words, there's no free lunch won by extending your term. You haven't saved any interest by choosing a 15-year repayment term. Rather, by kicking the proverbial loan repayment can down the road, you have instead increased the total interest that will be paid over the life of your loan because the loan will accrue interest for a longer period of time:
Total Interest Paid for Different Repayment Terms
Bottom line: when choosing a repayment term, there is a natural trade-off between minimizing your monthly loan payment vs. minimizing total interest paid over the life of the loan.
4) How do prepayments affect the repayment term decision?
Our examples have assumed zero prepayments made during the entire repayment period. "Prepayments" are payments made in excess of the scheduled monthly loan payment. For example, if a borrower refinances $100,000 of student loans with the hypothetical 10-year loan option, the resulting payment would be $1,110.21 each month. If instead the borrower pays $1,500 for his or her first monthly payment, the extra $389.79 would go towards paying down the outstanding principal balance. By reducing the outstanding principal, prepayments work to shorten the repayment term of the loan. For example, if the borrower pays an extra $300 per month, he or she will pay off the 10-year loan in less than 7.5 years.
Some borrowers make only the scheduled monthly payment, but in our experience, most borrowers do prepay a portion of their loans along the way. Bonuses, savings and increased salary are typical reasons behind a prepayment. (For one grad's perspective on how much he has decided to prepay, check out this piece by our own Nate Howard.) Most lenders -- CommonBond included -- do not charge a prepayment penalty, but it's still important to review the lender's repayment policy for any qualifiers that could reduce the attractiveness of prepaying.
Prepayments can significantly reduce the total interest paid over the repayment period, without impacting the monthly loan payment. For example, let's assume you make only the scheduled payments -- i.e., no prepayments -- for the first 5 years of the repayment term, and then you make one large prepayment in the 60th month to fully pay off the remaining loan balance.
The Effect of a Single Prepayment on Total Interest Paid
That single prepayment greatly reduces the cost (interest paid) for choosing either of the longer repayment terms. Note that you would still pay more interest over the 5-year period if you had chosen a 10- or 15-year term, but much less interest than if no prepayment was made along the way. That extra interest is the effective cost for the borrower's option to flexibly prepay at his or her convenience.
This is a critical point. While a 5-year repayment plan minimizes total interest paid, it also binds the borrower to pay $1,887.12 every single month. That may provide little room for error based on the borrower's monthly income, both to meet other expenses and to build a savings cushion in the event there is a financial hiccup along the way.
If a borrower instead wants the option to pay less each month, they can take that option by choosing a loan with a longer term, but the price they pay for that option is higher interest paid over the life of the loan thanks to 1) a higher interest rate for a longer loan term and 2) the delay in principal payments, which keeps your outstanding loan balance larger for longer.
Bottom line: Prepayments reduce both the total interest paid and the life of your loan. If your goal is to pay off your student loans as quickly as possible -- but only to do so when you are in a financially comfortable position -- a longer repayment term may be worth the cost of paying extra interest until you can prepay the remaining loan balance.
5) How does your specific financial situation affect your repayment plan choice?
The considerations thus far are applicable to all borrowers, but your specific financial situation will determine which repayment option makes the most sense for you. The calculus behind making the right choice for your specific situation starts with calculating how much disposable income you have after first taking into account absolute life essentials (rent, taxes, food, insurance, health, etc.) and then taking into account an estimate for other things on which you'd like to spend the remaining income (vacations, gifts, investments, etc.). The difference between these two figures -- your essential spend and your discretionary spend -- is an estimate for how much income you will have available for your student loan payments. I recommend adding an expense cushion of 5 percent of your post-tax income for emergencies or underestimations, just in case.
Using our three hypothetical refinance options as an example, if you were capable of making a $1,400 student loan payment each month, the 5-year term option is probably not your best move, and you may look to either the 10-year or 15-year options to take advantage of the lower monthly payments.
Bottom line: Your personal financial goals have great influence over your repayment plan choice. If your financial situation improves over time, you may be in a more comfortable position to make prepayments to eliminate your remaining student debt.

Loving Leadership: Does Our Definition Do Us a Disservicereddit
My last blog considered how it's likely that a leader who has inspired us did so because of their loving, but that our beliefs and conditioning may get in the way of our being more loving in our leadership. In this blog I address another stepping stone that many people view as a stumbling block to expressing greater loving as a leader: the various definitions for love or loving.
Love. Debates abound about what the word means. Take for example the various Ancient Greek words for love and their definitions:
Storge means affection. You might use this word in a parental sense, when you're putting up with a relative who is "acting out." "Ya gotta love that kid."
Philia refers to mental love. Another interpretation might be a dispassionate love driven by a person's virtue or loyalty toward a close friend. "I really love that guy."
Éros is about passionate love. Surprisingly, in ancient Greek it was also used in a higher form, referring to the soul recalling experience that contributed to the understanding of spiritual truths - a lover of wisdom. ( Plato's Symposium -  speech by Socrates )
Agápe represents a deeper sense of true unconditional love.
Some of the Greek definitions would run counter to many of today's Human Resources policies intended to ensure an appropriate and neutral work environment. This presents some challenges for using the word love or loving as a leadership quality.
Let's look at deeper aspects of loving.
There are five attributes that are in alignment with leading: acceptance, reverence, presence, courage and gratitude. Presence, courage and gratitude have been written about extensively as virtues of wise leaders. The other two are less frequently addressed, though no less important.
Acceptance - For this discussion, we are considering acceptance as harmonizing with the current reality. It is a coming into alignment with what is actually going on, instead of trying to diminish its reality, wishing things were otherwise, or railing against the unfairness of how things are. Acceptance is a great teacher that helps us recognize multiple perspectives. The challenge for many leaders comes from their ego declaration that their perspective is the only correct or authentic one. Acceptance may require that the leader learn to quiet his or her ego.
As we move toward a world of collaboration and away from command and control, acceptance is becoming increasingly valuable as the first step towards interpersonal understanding.
Some interpretations of the word acceptance have come to mean acquiescence.  We are not suggesting that accepting is the same as agreement. It's not. It is simply a recognition of other people's perspectives while dialoging with them. We accept that they hold a valid point of view different from ours.
Reverence - This word was originally one of the primary virtues espoused by ancient Greek and Chinese cultures. It means deep respect, with perhaps a bit of awe. Today, reverence is primarily used in a religious context.
However, focusing on the core construct of deep respect has value within a leadership context. Holding deep respect--reverence--for another allows clearer communication to take place. If we hold judgment towards another person, that judgment acts as a filter that can disrupt communication.
Together acceptance and reverence create a clear channel for enhanced interpersonal communication. Both are needed in today's leaders.
Now to our take on the other aspects.
Presence - Often how "presence" is described and how a person can develop it, more accurately matches the definition of charisma. However, at it's simplest definition a person is present when their attention is fully focused in (present with) a particular moment of time.
It's simple, but not easy for most of us to do. We may have flashes of being present, but our imagination, emotions and mind are all designed to call our attention to their moment-to-moment desires. How often have you been in a conversation with a close friend and had to ask that something be repeated because you didn't hear it? Your mind may have slipped off to something else, and you were no longer present with them.
Courage - Leadership courage has been written about for eons. Both loving and courage have a similar root: heart. Heart isn't often found in today's leadership education because that mostly focuses on the mind. However, we contend that leadership wisdom requires our mind, our heart and our hunches. It takes courage to engage our heart and to confront fear (our own or others'), pain, danger, uncertainty or perhaps intimidation (another fear-based behavior).
Gratitude - This is the quality of being thankful. If we tie being thankful with recognition toward the person whose action we are being thankful for, we create an organizational culture that is twelve times more likely to enjoy strong business results. ( see Bersin & Associates ). Gratitude simply says to others that our success didn't happen solely as a result of "my" stellar leadership abilities.
Simple Not Easy
These five simple "ways of being" help bring forward more loving in our leadership. They require we open our hearts more widely to those we are leading. They are not complex, but they challenge our comfort zones. And, in this context, they re-define and clarify the definition of loving leadership so that being a loving leader can be an acceptable, worthy and desirable goal.
In future blogs we'll look at each of these attributes more deeply. And I welcome your thoughts and comments on what we've presented so far.

Weekend Roundup: Scotland Stays Stitchedreddit
This week, the world reeled from a welter of cross currents. Though the "yes" vote on independence lost in the end, the Scottish referendum revealed a passionately dis-United Kingdom. Elsewhere, Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in India, the other Asian giant, calling for a global economic alliance of the " world's factory and world's back office ."  On Wall Street, China's Alibaba launched what is expected to be the biggest market valuation of an IPO ever. Pope Francis, meanwhile, mused that we had already entered "a piecemeal WWIII."
In an exclusive commentary for The WorldPost, former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown argues that the real quarrel of his fellow Scots is with the dislocations of globalization, not the Union.
Thanks to his last minute stem-winder in Glasgow against independence, Brown, who successfully steered the world away from financial calamity as the G-20 chair in 2009, is now also hailed as the man who saved the United Kingdom.
As Xi met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the chair of the Indian parliament's foreign affairs committee and former U.N. Under-secretary General, Shashi Tharoor , wrote from New Delhi that China and India "have outgrown the world order dominated by the West." Also writing from New Delhi, former Times of India editor and WorldPost editorial board member, Dileep Padgaonkar , outlines how Prime Minister Modi is already reshaping the geopolitics of Asia.
In our regular feature, " Following Francis ," Sebastien Maillard files an inspiring report from Rome on the humble daily routine of the pope.
In an interview, David Nabarro , the U.N. point man on the Ebola crisis, links the rapid spread of the virus to ill-prepared health systems in countries just emerging from civil strife. Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council calls for "rethinking emergency aid" with more emphasis on development as the global refugee crisis reaches proportions not seen since WWII. Young-mok Kim , who heads Korea's International Cooperation Agency, argues that raising "the bottom 40 percent" is the key to inclusive development.
WorldPost Senior Editor Kathleen Miles reports on the view of Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif ,  who says that the U.S. is repeating the same mistake in its fight against ISIS as it did by invading Iraq: "Foreign presence in any territory creates a dynamic for demagogues like ISIS to use the resentment in the population of being occupied." In an interview with Mehdi Hasan , the FBI agent who tracked down Osama bin Laden warns that the Islamic State group is trying to "suck the West into a new war."
In this week's " Forgotten Fact " series, the WorldPost looks at the Islamic State and social media, revealing that "not everyone tweeting ISIS threats is actually representing the group."
Writing from Beirut, former MI6 agent Alastair Crooke challenges President Obama's assertion that ISIS is "not Islamic." WorldPost Middle East Correspondent Sophia Jones reports from Istanbul that Bulgaria is breaking international law by turning back Syrian refugees. She also chronicles the travails of one homeless Syrian family stuck at a border bus stop between Syria and Turkey. French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy sounds the alarm over the enveloping chill of anti-Semitism in France.
In a riposte to the argument that NATO expansion provoked Russia into a conflict over Ukraine, Maria Snegovaya writes from Moscow that Vladimir Putin's real fear is the subversive effect of Kiev's closer links to the European Union on his Eurasian vision. Writing from Beijing, Zheng Yu sees a clear distinction in U.S. interests and global policy that will lead it to contain Russia but cooperate with China.
As the U.N. Climate Summit approaches, we post the second in a series of videos narrated by actor Leo DiCaprio, now a U.N. Messenger of Peace, on the urgency of keeping carbon resources in the ground.
Finally, Arthur Miller writes about how cutting-edge science is redefining contemporary art in an essay accompanied by stunning photos -- including one of a green iridescent rabbit.

15-Year-Old s Striking Photographs Are Pure MagicFifteen-year-old David Uzochukwu recently won the 2014 EyeEm Photographer of the Year award, beating out 15,000 competitors with his powerful, ethereal photos .
Here's the Austrian teen's winning photo, titled “Cry Me a River”:
This striking self-portrait was part of a personal project last summer, during which David committed to taking one photograph a day. David told The Huffington Post in an email that "working on a tight deadline and being unable to always plan ahead forced me to get creative.” Of course, it helps that he clearly has the eye for what makes a powerful photo, as can be seen below.
David's EyeEm award won him a stay in a five-star Berlin hotel and the opportunity to present and discuss his photography at September's 2014 EyeEm Festival . He documented his trip to Berlin as only an award-winning photographer could.
David’s been pursuing his love of photography for five years, and he’s been taking these amazing self-portraits for two years.
From the moment David started taking photographs, he was hooked. He told HuffPost that "the passion that I felt the first time I consciously took photos is the same I feel today.”
David doesn't have to look far for new ideas. "I'm inspired by everything around me -- light, people, stories, art."  Here, he shows how the right lighting can create magic.
Though these photographs clearly require mad skill, David says the most important thing an aspiring photographer can do is just pick up the camera. “Shoot a lot!" he adds.  "You'll find out what you like and what you don't, and learn something new about photography every time you pick up your camera."
Feeling inspired to take some photos? Just don't commit David's biggest iPhone photo faux-pas: Using flash when it's light outside. “Turn that flash off. Please.”

Climate protesters to  flood  Wall StreetClimate protesters to 'flood' Wall Street on Monday
By Ben Rooney   @ben_rooney September 21, 2014: 8:40 PM ET
Activists say Wall Street Capitalism is fueling the climate crisis.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Hundreds of environmental activists plan to "flood" Wall Street on Monday to protest the role Big Business plays in climate change.
The #FloodWallStreet campaign is part of a series of demonstrations taking place this week as world leaders gather in New York for a climate change summit on Tuesday at the United Nations.
The goal is to highlight "a financial system that's perpetuating the climate crisis," said Bessie Schwarz, a spokeswoman for the group behind the #FloodWallStreet campaign.
Thousands of protesters took to the streets Sunday in New York as part of the People's Climate March, which organizers said was the largest climate change demonstration ever.
"One day after the biggest climate march ever, we plan to take this energy down to Wall Street," said Schwarz, who was reached while taking part in Sunday's protest.
Opinion: No one cares about climate change. Really?
On Monday protesters will decry the "financial profiteering" they say is exacerbating the climate crisis.
While no specific companies are being targeted, the movement is broadly aimed at "polluters and those profiting from the fossil fuel industry."
Organizers expect anywhere from a few hundred to more than a thousand people to take part in Monday's event.
The plan is for people to gather at Battery Park in lower Manhattan early Monday, then march to Wall Street where they "will stay until forcibly removed," said Schwarz.

Organizers expect participants to be "arrested in droves" as they stage "sit-ins" around New York City's financial district. Blue-clad protesters plan to unfurl a 300-foot banner and will inflate a 15 foot "carbon bubble," according to a statement on the #FloodWallStreet website.
The New York Police Department said it would have "an adequate detail in place" to respond.
 
Why climate change is an economic problem
Schwarz said the demonstration will feature speeches by a number of well-known climate change activists, as well as local New York residents who were affected by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

The UN is not expected to announce any concrete agreements this week. But officials hope Tuesday's meeting will create momentum for greater action on climate change at a summit next year.
The White House released a report in May asserting that climate change is real and will only worsen over time.
The National Climate Assessment said evidence of human-made climate change "continues to strengthen" and predicted that flooding, wildfires and drought will intensify if nothing is done to curb emissions of greenhouse gases.
A campaign backed by the fossil fuel industry and its allies challenges whether climate change is real, and if so, whether human activity such as increased carbon emissions from power plants, factories and cars contributes to it.

Brick-and-mortar stores go online to expand reachArpita Mukherjee      Follow @arpitamukherjee    Last Updated: September 23, 2014  | 11:10 IST
With this tie-up, however, there would be one thing that all the orders would be fulfilled by Croma's distribution centres and delivered using Snapdeal's delivery capabilities.
Croma, a Tata Group-promoted electronics retail chain, has tied up with online marketplace Snapdeal wherein both would sell certain products exclusively at Croma stores and retail those items also on snapdeal.com where Croma has set up an exclusive shop. Croma would also be selling its own products on the portal.
This is a part of working towards an omni-channel strategy, which essentially means retailing through multiple channels such as the web as well as brick-and-mortar stores. Currently, products from other brands include a tablet model by Lenovo and a mobile phone model by Karbonn, which would be sold exclusively by them. "We are in talks and we will have more such deals going ahead," said Ajit Joshi, CEO & MD, Croma, Infiniti Retail, without disclosing other names.
With this tie-up, however, there would be one thing that all the orders would be fulfilled by Croma's distribution centres and delivered using Snapdeal's delivery capabilities. The areas around its existing stores, currently numbering 96 in 16 cities in India, could be catered to by the stores themselves.
A fairly similar announcement was made earlier this month wherein Future Group's Kishore Biyani said the company will invest Rs 100 crore in an e-commerce initiative and will utilise the existing merchandise at its stores, and distribution centres, to fulfil orders that come through from customers.
What brick-and-mortar retailers have been attempting recently tells us how they are considering the use of omni-channel retail for more than just reaching out to a larger customer base. The companies are looking at using their existing warehousing capabilities to ensure efficient distribution of existing merchandise and, in turn, avoid a lot of reverse logistics. Brick-and-mortar retailers are in a way ensuring that their existing inventory can be utilised as well as managed better.
On the one hand, Snapdeal, which connects with 5,000 cities in India, would help increase the reach for Croma. On the other, it would also provide Croma with data and information on which products are working well, along with the geographies where they are working best. The same would happen for Future Group, which would keep getting instant information of the product flow through its online channel.
This would essentially help them manage the supply chain better wherein brands would now be able to replenish inventory faster and much more accurately, rather than getting a chunk of inventory stuck in the pipeline. "The supply chain advantages are far more interesting for a brand," says Snapdeal Co-founder and CEO Kunal Bahl. "It helps them to more appropriately ascertain the demand for a particular product geographically," he adds.
A similar thought was expressed by Future Retail's Joint Managing Director Rakesh Biyani. "I hold inventory in 180 doors today, and all of them do not perform at the same level," says Biyani, talking about the technology being brought in that would enable the company to gauge the demand and replenish accordingly, and also utilise the existing inventory to service demand from the online channel.
Under the online initiative, Big Bazaar would be able to take orders from various parts of the country and fulfil it from its distribution centres, or stores closest to the location. The company currently houses about 160,000 stock keeping units in its stores. However, the one thing that would boost these initiatives immensely is the implementation of the goods and services tax, say both Joshi and Biyani.

Mars Mission passes crucial stage as Isro test-fires main engineMars Mission passes crucial stage as Isro test-fires main engine
T E Narasimhan | Chennai Sep 22, 2014 06:23 PM IST
The India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) today passed a crucial test. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) today successfully conducted the test firing of its Main Liquid Engine, which was idle for nearly 300 days, inside the spacecraft.
 
This crucial Trajectory Correction Manoeuver (TCM) was configured for verifying the performance of the Main Liquid Engine to determine the strategy for Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) on September 24.
At 2.47 pm, Isro said that test firing was successful and that there was a perfect burn for four seconds as programmed. "The trajectory has been corrected. Mom will now go ahead with the nominal plan for Mars Orbit Insertion," it stated.
Commenting on today's development, Isro's Chairman K Radhakrishnan told Business Standard: "Test firing performed as expected and the space craft is in good health. Confidence level (to make the Mission success) has gone up."
Isro in a statement said that the 440 Newton Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) of India’s Mars Orbiter Spacecraft was successfully fired for a duration of 3.968 seconds at 1430 Hrs IST today (September 22, 2014). This operation of the spacecraft’s main liquid engine was also used for the spacecraft’s trajectory correction and changed its velocity by  2.18 metre/second.
With this successful test firing, Mars Orbiter Insertion (MOI) operation of the spacecraft is scheduled to be performed on the morning of September 24, 2014 at 07:17:32 hrs IST by firing the LAM along with eight smaller liquid engines for a duration of about 24 minutes.

Corporates upbeat on Modi's US visit, eye tangible outcomes
The survey covered 261 corporate heads and was conducted in the second-third week of September, ahead of the visit.
Post your opinion here
 
India Inc is optimistic about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming US visit, with 77 percent of corporates eyeing tangible outcomes from meetings with President Barack Obama and a boost to bilateral trade from current level of USD 150 billion, says an Assocham survey.
The survey covered 261 corporate heads and was conducted in the second-third week of September, ahead of the visit.
"With the US accounting for over 60 percent of India's software exports of USD 100 billion and the merchandise exports and imports totaling about USD 62 billion, along with the two-way foreign direct investment and the portfolio, the India-US annual commercial engagement is well above USD 150 billion.
"With these cumulative figures, the US is India's largest economic partner holding a greater potential for further scale-up," the industry body said.
Moreover as many as 67 percent of the respondents in the Assocham survey said they would expect the Obama-Modi personal chemistry to be a high point of the forthcoming visit.
"In fact, India Inc expects this very chemistry to then reflect on a whole range of issues which confront the India-US economic engagement, be it divergent views in WTO, issues on visas for IT professionals, non-tariff barriers from the Indian side or national treatment demand by the US on solar equipment in India or opening of the retail and financial sector," Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.
Rawat further said the way Modi has gone about building bridges with the Chinese President Xi Jinping and a personal chemistry with the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe clearly
points to his capabilities for striking a similar friendship with President Obama.
Between China and Japan, the Prime Minister has already received commitment of investment of USD 55 billion from them, he added.
On whether Modi's interaction with business leaders in the US and other policy-influencing people will register a new imprint about India's investment climate, an overwhelming 82 percent of CEOs and corporate leaders in India said the perception has already changed for better and Modi's personal interaction with them will further improve the perception.
Rawat said the industry expects that the government will deliver on the Prime Minister's promise in Japan that a red carpet treatment will be extended to investors instead of red tape.
The Prime Minister will be on a five-day visit, beginning September 26, to the US during which he will address the UN General Assembly in New York and then travel to Washington where he would hold bilateral talks with US President Barack Obama.

PMO asks commerce ministry to cut unnecessary imports

New Delhi: Ahead of the Thursday launch of the "Make in India" campaign announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Independence Day, his office has written to the commerce ministry to forge a plan to reduce the country's dependence on unwarranted imports.
A commerce ministry source told IANS on Monday that they have identified nine commodities where annual imports constitute more than $100 million each.
Edible oil, which leads the import basket with a 60 per cent share, is among the nine commodities, the others being pulses, fresh fruits, cashew, sugar, alcoholic beverages, processed and packaged items, cocoa products and sesame seeds.
A commerce ministry source told IANS on Monday that they have identified nine commodities where annual imports constitute more than $100 million each.
#pmo #imports #commerce ministry
"The ministry has written to the concerned sector councils and associations, seeking suggestions on ways to reduce such imports," the source said.
With local prices of oilseeds falling in the wake of softening edible oil prices overseas, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan told reporters earlier this month that there were no immediate plans to raise the import duty on edible oils.
Industry associations have been demanding a rise in the import duty following a sharp drop in local soybean and groundnut prices.
The world's leading buyer of edible oils, India meets more than half its edible oil needs through imports.
In January, the government raised the import duty on refined edible oil to 10 percent. The industry had been demanding an increase in the import duty on refined oil to 14.5 per cent thereby ensuring a marked difference between crude and refined edible oil.
Owing to the earlier five percent gap in the duties, there had been an increase in the import of refined oils, leading to a fall in the capacity utilisation of domestic refiners.

All play  no work but big pay for Lalit ModiNo work but big pay for Lalit Modi
N Sundaresha Subramanian | New Delhi Sep 23, 2014 12:50 AM IST
Lalit Modi might be famous for his penchant for cricket administration and his ongoing tussle with International Cricket Council chief N Srinivasan, but it is his father,  K K Modi’s empire that accounts for a significant portion of his earnings.
Modi, famous for having made Indian Premier League (IPL) a household name, is seeking reappointment as director of Godrfey Phillips India (GPI), flagship company of the K K Modi group.
But corporate governance experts are opposed to this, saying Modi didn’t attend even a single board meeting of the company during 2013-14 and yet, got Rs 1.7 crore as annual remuneration.
MAN WITH THE MOOLAH
Lalit Modi is seeking reappointment as director of Godrfey Phillips India, the flagship company of the K K Modi group
 
Rs 1.10 crore: The amount that Modi was paid for 2012-13. That year, he  he attended only one board meeting, through teleconferencing
 
For the past two years, Modi has been based in London after Indian authorities initiated legal proceedings against him
 
The proxy advisory firm has asked shareholders to vote against the resolution seeking Modi’s reappointment
Explaining the rationale behind the remuneration, the company had said, “Lalit Kumar Modi has been a prominent member of the board, serving the company through the last two decades. Presently, he is a non-executive director in the company. In recognition of his strong entrepreneurial skills, valuable strategic advice and the assistance provided by him in supporting various business initiatives of the company, the board accorded its approval to remunerate him by way of commission under section 309(4) (b) of the Companies Act, 1956.”
Proxy advisory firm Stakeholders’ Empowerment Services said the company should disclose why it was paying commission to only one non-executive director. “The remuneration of Modi is not aligned to those of other non-executive directors. It is higher than that paid to the board’s chairman. He has not attended the last three AGMs (annual general meetings); in the last three years, he has attended only seven per cent of all board meetings.”
In 2012-13, he attended only one board meeting, through teleconferencing. For that year, he was paid Rs 1.10 crore.
As the pay package of R Ramamurthy, a non-promoter executive director , doesn’t include a performance-based component, it is felt the company’s remuneration policy is skewed in favour of promoters.
Experts believe the remuneration to executive directors should be aligned with the company’s performance and should, therefore, include a variable performance-based component.
“Lalit K Modi was paid Rs 170 lakh as remuneration, 85 times the remuneration paid to the next highest-paid non-executive director/independent director. This indicates the company’s remuneration policy is highly skewed in favour of promoters,” Stakeholders’ Empowerment Services said.
The proxy advisory firm has asked shareholders to vote against the resolution seeking Modi’s reappointment.
An email seeking comment to a Godfrey Phillips spokesperson on Saturday did not elicit any response. Lalit Modi, too, didn’t respond to a message left on his website, www.lalitmodi.com.
Through the past couple of years, Modi has been based in London, following Indian authorities initiating legal proceedings against him over allegations of irregularities in the IPL.

Home ministry orders probe into Ahmedabad hotels diktat to Northeast staff during XivisitThe management of hotel expressed surprise over the reports and claimed all staffers, including those from the northeast, did duty on September 17 when Xi had a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
PTI | Posted: September 22, 2014 6:40 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 6:52 pm
Hours after the Union Home Ministry ordered a probe into reports that employees of an Ahmedabad hotel from the northeast were asked to stay away from duty during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent visit, the city police and hotel management have denied issuing any such instruction.
“I am not aware of any such diktat given by police to the hotel authorities about their staff. We were just concerned about the Tibetans,” said Joint Commissioner of Police(JCP)-Crime A K Sharma.
JCP of Special Branch Vikas Sahay too said he was not aware of any such order having been issued.
The Management of hotel Hyatt Ahmedabad expressed surprise over the reports and claimed all staffers, including those from the northeast, did duty on September 17 when Xi had a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi there.
“There was no such order given to the hotel staff on that day. All staff, including those from the northeast, was present in the hotel and doing duty when Chinese President arrived. I am surprised as to how such baseless reports are doing the rounds,” said Marketing Manager of Hyatt Ahmedabad Ayesha Mishra.
Earlier in the day, the Home Ministry had asked the Intelligence Bureau to ascertain the veracity of reports about the order and, if it was indeed issued, who did it and why.

Adivasi leaders demand probe into alleged molestation by CRPF jawan in JharkhanddistrictPrint

Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Bandhgaon | Posted: September 22, 2014 6:29 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 7:16 pm
Frustrated by the second such incident in just over a fortnight and the police’s refusal to register an FIR, the traditional adivasi leaders of West Singhbhum’s Bandhgaon came together on Monday to ensure an investigation began into the allegation that a CRPF jawan molested a woman during an anti-left wing extremist operation.
It was an extraordinary show of solidarity from the Manki-Munda Sangh of Bandhgaon block, whose 216 Mundas and nine Mankis – traditional leaders who inherit their titles – decided on September 16 to protest the molestation. It was also an act of reclaiming territory: no elected representative, even those of the panchayats, were given pride of place. The leaders succeeded in convincing police officials to attend the meeting and initiating the process of registering an FIR.
The incident in question took place on the afternoon of September 8 in Kudmud village of Jalasar panchayat. “I was at home when a CRPF man walked in, demanding water. I could see two of his colleagues standing outside,” said the 25-year-old woman, whose husband was away at the time.
The woman said the CRPF man handed her two bottles to fill water. “When I asked for caps to close the bottles, he began stripping himself and caught hold of me,” she said. The woman said when she screamed for help, the three jawans escaped into the jungle. The village elders had taken the woman to the police station on September 9, but police officers refused to file an FIR.
At the meeting held under a peepul tree within the Bandhgaon market, the villagers presented three youngsters who told officer in-charge of the police station K.K. Jha and Block Development Officer Mohd. Shahzad Pervez that they were beaten with batons the same day. Of them, Etwa Lomga’s case related to the molestation. “I was down with fever when the CRPF personnel started interrogating me. They beat me twice on the shin with a baton. When I got a chance, I asked to go to the toilet and used the opportunity to escape,” he said. Etwa said he had run into the forest behind the woman’s house and that three CRPF jawans chased him to the edge of the forest.
Mikhail Lomga, the Munda of Kudmud, said it was the first time security personnel had misbehaved in his village. “The operation had been going on for about a week before the incident. Forces were stationed at schools in two villages – Kahdiri and Podongir. They came to our continued…

iPhone opening weekend sales top 10 million:..."Sales for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded our expectations for the launch weekend, and we couldn't be happier," said Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: Apple broke its sales record for an opening weekend of a new iPhone model, delivering 10 million in three days and boasting it could have sold more if it had them.
"Sales for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded our expectations for the launch weekend, and we couldn't be happier," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said Monday.
"We could have sold many more iPhones with greater supply and we are working hard to fill orders as quickly as possible."
The opening weekend for the large-screen iPhones allowed Apple to break its record for launch weekend sales of nine million, which its set last year when it launched the iPhone 5S and 5C.
The new models were launched on Friday in the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico and Singapore.
They will be available in more than 20 additional countries from September 26, and 115 countries by the end of the year.
The positive response was noted by analysts who said Apple is likely to get a lift from the new phones.
"Despite the supply chain constraints... Apple executed extremely well in the face of severe supply constraints," said Brian White at Cantor Fitzgerald in a note to clients.
"More important to us, we believe Apple is in the midst of a 'super cycle' that we expect will keep the stock heading in an upward trajectory."
Benjamin Reitzes at Barclays was also impressed by the sales figures and added that "the key here is that the figure could have been much higher -- which is obvious if you visited a store over the weekend."
Apple shares gained 0.15 percent Monday to $101.11. The global rollout led to long lines outside Tokyo's flagship Apple store in glitzy Ginza, and in stores from Hong Kong to Paris to New York.
Cook personally kicked off sales of the iPhone 6, joining in "selfies" and shaking hands with customers Friday outside the company's store in Palo Alto, California, near his Silicon Valley home.
Both new iPhones have larger screens as Apple catches up with the "phablet" trend pioneered by competitors such as Samsung, which has had success with its Galaxy Note series.
The iPhone 6 has a screen of 4.7 inches and the 6 Plus is 5.5 inches, reflecting a growing preference for bigger displays, despite Apple's earlier vow to stick with the traditional size.
Main rival Samsung has long had a range of larger handsets, which are popular in Asia, and will soon release a new Galaxy Note 4.
Apple said more than four million pre-orders were received in the 24 hours after the sale was announced.
The new iPhones come with Apple steadily losing market share to low-cost Android devices from South Korean rival Samsung and others.
While Apple sold more than 35 million iPhones in the second quarter, its growth was slower than that of many rivals and its market share dipped to 11.7 percent, according to the research firm IDC.
Samsung led the global smartphone market in the quarter with sales of 74 million and a market share of 25 percent, according to IDC figures.
But the strongest growth in the past quarter came from Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Lenovo, which boosted their market share, notably in their home market.
Apple has not yet announced plans for sales of the iPhone 6 in China. State officials said last week the US firm still needs to obtain "a key network access license" before selling on the mainland.
Apple did get broader access to the Chinese market earlier this year when China Mobile, the country's biggest wireless provider, started selling iPhones, ending a six-year wait in a crucial market for the US technology giant.
Along with the new iPhone, Apple released an updated mobile operating system, iOS 8 with more features for fitness monitoring and home automation.
The company also plans to roll out its Apple Watch which links to the iPhone in 2015, and has announced the newer iPhones would be equipped for mobile payments in the US market.

The rupee on Monday closed one paisa down at 60.82 against the US dollar at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market on alternate bouts of demand and supply, snapping a four-day rising trend.
In lacklustre trade, the rupee commenced lower at 60.85 against the American unit from its previous close of 60.81 . It was trapped in a range of 60.7425 and 60.88 before concluding at 60.82, showing a minor fall of one paisa.
In the previous four days, the domestic unit had risen by 32 paise.
The dollar index was down 0.04 per cent against its major global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO, said, "Rupee traded in a thin range and ended flat. Rupee is expected to appreciate in coming days tracking gains in local equities. The trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 60.30 to 61.30."
The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex on Monday washed out  initial sharp losses and gained 116.32 points to end at two-week high.
Foreign  Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought shares worth US $18.48 million  last Friday, as per data released by the Securities and Exchange Board  of India (Sebi).

BofA-ML sees country s current fiscal CAD down at 1.7%BofA-ML sees country's current fiscal CAD down at 1.7 per cent
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 22, 2014  | 19:59 IST

The nation's current account deficit (CAD) is likely to narrow down to 1.7 per cent of GDP this fiscal but may widen to 2.3 per cent in FY16, says a report.
"We have cut down our FY15 current account deficit forecast to 1.7 per cent of GDP from 2.6 per cent earlier as it does not look like New Delhi will remove gold import restrictions in the near future," according to the report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML).
In the quarter ended June, CAD , which indicates imports of goods services and transfer are higher than their exports, stood at $7.8 billion, or 1.7 per cent of GDP.
The report expects the deficit to widen to a fundable 2.3 per cent of GDP in FY16, once gold imports are eased.
The US brokerage said its estimates assume that oil price will settle at $108 a barrel in FY16, although it is currently trading much lower at $98 a barrel and gold rates will stabilise at $1,375 per ounce in the next fiscal.
In terms of capital inflows, BofA-ML has forecast a rise in FDI flows to $25 billion from $ 20 billion and portfolio investments to $35 billion from $ 25 billion.
The report said the Reserve Bank of India needs to build foreign exchange reserves of $373 billion by March 2016 to maintain the present eight-month import cover.
"Including the forwards, the forex reserves currently stand at about $350 billion, assuming the $26 billion raised via the FCNR-B swaps last year are rolled over. This implies the RBI has to buy $23 billion more by March 2016.
The brokerage expects the central bank to continue to buy forex over 58 levels to guard against contagion as done by previous Governors Bimal Jalan and Y V Reddy. Building forex reserves would allow the RBI to cut rates.
The report further said the rupee is likely to end 2014 at 61 per dollar as against the earlier expectation of 60, despite a strong greenback. BofA-ML revised its end-2015 rupee-dollar forecast to 60 from 64 earlier.
"The RBI will likely maintain its 58-62 'range of tolerance' for the rupee until it is able to build up sufficient forex reserves - close to 10 months' import cover - which looks unlikely over our forecast horizon," the report concluded.

Chennai: In a significant decision which is set to benefit students aspiring to enter IITs, the Council meet of the prestigious institutions on Monday decided to consider the aggregate marks secured in Class 12 Board Examinations for admission.
"In addition to the top-20 percentile condition, it has been decided now to give another provision [to aspirants seeking admission] which is the marks secured in the board exams," Secretary, Union Ministry of Human Resources, Ashok Thakur said.
The 48th meeting of the Council of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) was held here today at the IIT Madras, chaired by Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani. Presently, only students those who are in the top-20 percentile in their Class XII board exams are admitted to the 16 IITs across the country.  Also, they must have cleared the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) advanced.
Presently, only students those who are in the top-20 percentile in their Class XII board exams are admitted to the 16 IITs across the country.
#iit #iit jee #cbse #hrd ministry
About 200 students with top scores in JEE, considered tough, could not get into the IITs as they were not in the top-20 percentile league. Now, with the new norm, even if a student does not figure in the 20 percentile category, she or he could aspire to get into the IITs provided they meet the minimum marks prescribed by the Council.
Briefing about the deliberations, Thakur said that the Council approved the new norm of marks secured after due deliberations. According to the norm, an aspiring OBC and general category candidate should have secured 75 per cent and those belonging to SC, ST, and disabled section should have got 70 per cent in class 12 board exam to be considered for admission in addition
to clearing the JEE.
"This norm will bring tremendous releif to students. Now marks secured formula will be there alongwith 20-percentile rule." Replying to a question, Thakur said the heads of the IITs in Chennai and Kanpur have been given the responsibility of preparing a framework for a new India-centric ranking system
for Indian institutions of higher learning.
When introduced, the system will cover the IITs and the Central universities and later it would be extended to UGC funded institutions. "This ranking system will be India centric. The parameters will be relevant to India. The IITs will take the lead and devise the framework for Indian institutions."
By March 2015, the framework for the ranking system is expected to be completed. A pan-Indian IIT-alumni centre, intended to be an interface between the industry and academia, will be set up at Bangalore. "The concept has been approved by the Council," he said.

New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Monday came to the help of a jailed suspected Maoist, who needs urgent surgery for brain tumour, by asking city police and AIIMS authorities to provide "immediate treatment" to him. Chandan Deonath, 38, who has been in Saraikela jail in Jamshedpur district of Jharkhand since November 27, 2007 for his alleged Maoist activities, is partially paralyzed and has been presently "housed in a verandah" of Hauz Khas police station since September 9, awaiting his turn for a surgery at AIIMS, according to a plea.
Deonath is suffering from life-threatening Brain Tumour and Penial Tumour With Hydro-Cphalus, it said. A bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru took note of the plea filed through Peoples' Union For Democratic RIGHTS [PUDR] and asked the SHO, Hauz Khas Police Station and the authorities at AIIMS to "provide immediate medical treatment to undertrial prisoner" and listed the case tomorrow again for hearing.
"This is a matter of life and death," senior advocate Colin Gonsalves said and sought urgent directions for AIIMS and Delhi police on the issue. Deonath and the PUDR, in their plea filed through lawyers Rishabh Sancheti, Padma Priya and Ashish Virmani, has sought directions that the undertrial be "provided with appropriate medical care, on an immediate basis".
Chandan Deonath is suffering from life-threatening Brain Tumour and Penial Tumour With Hydro-Cphalus.

"Respondents (Centre, AIIMS, Jharkhand and Delhi Police) must fix accountability for the inhuman treatment met out to Petitioner no. 1, so that such violation of fundamental rights be forthwith proscribed," the plea said.
"Respondents must be directed to institute a mechanism, by empaneling hospitals, and providing the Police/Jail authorities with details thereof; so as to eliminate the chances of an incident like the present happening ever again," it said.
Deonath was initially treated at Ranchi Institute of Medical Sciences and was diagnosed with a Brain Tumour, Penial Tumour With Hydro-Cphalus and found to be in need of surgery. He was then referred to AIIMS on August 29 for the surgery and has been housed at the verandah in the police station in an "inhuman condition" and is waiting for the surgery as the queue is long at the AIIMS, the plea said, adding that he has also suffered paralysis on the right side.

Firefighter in ice bucket challenge accident diesA Campbellsville fire captain was fatally injured when the ladder from this fire truck came too close to a power line on Aug. 21. (Reuters)
The viral ice bucket challenge fundraiser has been fading, but tragedy lingers for a Kentucky town.
A fire captain who was electrocuted during an ice bucket challenge gone wrong in Campbellsville  died on Saturday , a month after he was admitted to the hospital for his injuries.
Tony Grider, 41, was airlifted to a nearby hospital when the fire truck ladder that was being used to dump water on a group of students at the Campbellsville University came too close to a power line on Aug. 21.
Several firefighters were injured, including some who tried to climb the ladder to help their colleagues.
Grider, a 16-year veteran of the department, was in the bucket of the ladder with firefighter Simon Quinn, who was hospitalized for several weeks before being released.
The Ice Bucket Challenge was a smashing success for the ALS Foundation, raising more than $100 million for the organization. But the practice has caused some injuries – some fatal, including the death of an 18-year old in Scotland who jumped into a quarry after participating in the challenge.

Employees with work friends are more committed to their companiesEmployees with work friends more committed to companies, study shows
Chicago Tribune
By Ellen Jean Hirst, Tribune reporter
Study: Employees tend to trust their co-workers more than company leadership
Study: 73 percent of employees have laughed until they (almost) cried with co-workers at work
Employees with work friends are twice as likely to trust company leadership, study shows
A recent national study of worker relationships says work friends matter more than ever and companies should care more about fostering those connections.  
Most full-time employees spend more time with co-workers than their families, the study of 716 randomly sampled workers at companies with at least 500 employees found. The fall edition of the Globoforce Workforce Mood Tracker survey, which is conducted twice a year, was administered in August.
“There is … a strong argument in this data for companies to be more thoughtful about the cultures they are creating,” the report said, “and to actively promote the development of work friendships and emotional connections among employees.”
A few highlights on co-worker relationships:

SC appoints Anand Grover in whistleblower case  to report Oct 10SC appoints Anand Grover in whistleblower case, to report Oct 10
BS Reporter | New Delhi Sep 22, 2014 05:18 PM IST
The insistence on protection of the whistleblower in the 2G case and the demand of CBI director Ranjit Sinha for disclosure of his name took a new turn today when the Supreme Court appointed special public prosecutor Anand Grover to examine the whole issue and come back to the court on October 10.
The court stated that the issue has 'great ramifications' not only for the 2G investigations and trial which it is monitoring, but also for future public interest cases. Therefore, the bench headed by Justice H L Dattu asked Grover, who is the prosecutor in the 2G trial, to look into all the applications and responses filed regarding the records submitted to the court by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, represented by Prashant Bhushan.
At the start of the hearing, Bhushan 'unconditionally apologized for his inability to disclose the name of the whistle blower' who gave him the file notings and visitors’ register at Sinha’s official residence. His lawyer, Dushyant Dave, denied that there was any attempt at character assassination of Sinha.  The issue of the case diaries and the register given in sealed covers to the judges raised more fundamental issues, like whether Sinha should be allowed to be in overall charge of the investigation.
The records given to the judges purportedly contain evidence that Sinha was meeting several accused persons and tinkering with the prosecution. Bhushan wanted Sinha to withdraw from the investigations. He has also requested the court to recall the order asking him  to disclose the name of the whistle blower.
Sinha’s counsel Vikas Singh, submitted that Bhushan has committed contempt of court by declining to disclose the name of the mole, even to the judges, as ordered last Monday. He does not trust even the judges. This kind of litigation will do more public harm than good, counsel insisted.

South Indian Bank appoints V G Mathew as new MD & CEOSouth Indian Bank appoints V G Mathew as new MD & CEO

Private lender South Indian Bank has appointed V G Mathew as its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer for three years.
"...The Reserve Bank of India has conveyed their approval for appointment of V G Mathew as MD & CEO of the Bank for a period of three years," the bank said in a filing to the BSE.
Mathew's appointment will come to effect from October 1, 2014.
He was the Executive Vice President of the bank earlier.

Power generation jumps 22% during April-June against corresponding periodPower generation jumps 22% during April-June against corresponding period
Shreya Jai | New Delhi Sep 22, 2014 06:48 PM IST
Power generation in the country during April-June was 22% higher than in the same period last year. This was also when there were several reports of coal stocks with power plants close to critical levels.
Executives in the power generation industry said the controversy over coal stocks needs to be understood.
"This situation is always hand to mouth. This year, due to extended summer and less rainfall in north India, there has been high demand for power in the region, for which the stations were required to generate more power and to be run at high plant load factor. Due to this, whatever stock was received got consumed and this hampered build-up at the stations," said an NTPC official.
According to a Central Electricity Authority report, against domestic coal receipts of 405 million tonnes, total consumption by power plants was 457 mt (including imports) in 2012-13. Currently, against the daily requirement of 1.54 million tonnes of coal, the indigenous stock is 8.28 mt, enough to fire plants for six days across the country.
"The demand from thermal power plants is always higher than the supply. A coal stock of seven days is usual. It's during days of contingency that the situation gets worrisome," said the executive.
This was, for example, when the temperature in August was a record high at 37 degrees Celsius in Delhi. The volume of power demand doubled from the usual 180 million units a day and spot prices reached a five-year high of Rs 10 a unit. The peak demand deficit across the country was 4.3% against 3% last year in the same month.
One of the executives quoted above said they were not staring at a blackout. When the temperature cooled, demand went down from major states such as UP, Bihar and Haryana in the first week of September. Spot power prices went down to a three-year low.
Even so, 13,000 Mw of power generation capacity is shut owing to shortage of coal. August saw reports from the northern and western grids on a power shortage and apprehension of a blackout. NTPC, the country's largest thermal power producer, has units in six power plants totalling 2,500 Mw shut across the country due to coal shortage.
"Some cases of low coal production is in our knowledge due to rains/flooding in the mining areas. Transportation is a major issue as some power projects are located far away from the mine area and have to depend on the railway network, which is heavily burdened and congested. All these factors led to a crisis-like situation, despite CIL trying its best to meet the requirement," said a senior executive of NTPC.
To augment supply for the power sector, Coal India has cut the e-auction amount to half, to around 25 mt, and diverted the amount to power plants.

HC grants 3-wks protection to BMW from CCI s...Apart from seeking a stay on the fine, BMW has also challenged CCI's legal proceedings on alleged anti-competitive practice of selling spare parts at higher prices.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court today granted to BMW India three weeks interim protection from Competition Commission of India (CCI) order imposing a penalty of Rs 20.41 crore on the luxury car maker for allegedly violating trade norms in spare parts and after-services market.
Justice Vibhu Bakhru said the order by CCI will not take effect for three weeks by when BMW has to challenge the report of the anti-trust regulator before the Madras High Court which had already issued a "blanket order" on September, 2013 staying the investigation in the matter.
"As far as September, 2013 order is concerned, it's a blanket order. The dispute is not here, so we give them (BMW) three weeks interim protection. They are directed to go to Madras High Court.
"Today, the3 entire case is at Madras High Court, so this court will not interfere in the issue," the judge said.
On August 25, 2014, CCI had fined BMW and 13 other companies Rs 2,554 crore for violating trade norms in the spare parts and after-services market and the same was to be deposited within 60 days.
For each entity, the individual fine amounted to two per cent of their average turnover.
Apart from seeking a stay on the fine, BMW has also challenged CCI's legal proceedings on alleged anti-competitive practice of selling spare parts at higher prices.
It said Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has already got a stay order from the Delhi High Court, so it too should be treated on par with them.
BMW argued CCI had suo motu expanded the scope of investigations into the entire car industry even though it had originally received a complaint against three automobile firms - Honda, Volkswagen and FIAT.
It questioned whether the anti-trust regulator had the powers to expand the scope of investigations on its own even if the complainant had not named a company in the original complaint.
The Director General's (DG) investigation showed these car companies violated competition norms with respect to its agreements with local Original Equipment Suppliers (OESs) as well as in terms of pacts with authorised dealers. The DG is the investigation arm of CCI.
The complaint was filed in January, 2011 against Honda, Volkswagen and FIAT. In April 2011, CCI extended its probe to other manufacturers it found were following a similar practice.
Hyundai obtained a stay order from the Madras High Court against CCI's proceedings in February, 2013.
Subsequently, Nissan had also moved the Madras HC which had in September 2013 stayed the DG investigation against all the 14 car makers.
The Madras HC's single-judge bench had in June 2014 disposed of the car makers' plea.
Nissan had thereafter filed an appeal before a division bench of the Madras HC which had referred the matter back to the single judge while staying the fine imposed.
Besides BMW, the other companies on which penalties have been imposed were Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd, Honda Cars India Ltd, Volkswagen India, Fiat Group Automobiles India Pvt. Ltd, Ford India Pvt. Ltd, General Motors India Pvt. Ltd, Nissan Motor India Pvt. Ltd, Hindustan Motors Ltd, Mercedes-Benz India Pvt. Ltd, Maruti Suzuki and Skoda Auto India Pvt. Ltd.
The Commission had also found that these companies, which were found to be dominant in the after services markets for their respective brands, allegedly abused their dominant position affecting around two crore car consumers.
The fair trade watchdog had also directed the car makers to "cease and desist" from anti-competitive practices.
Meanwhile, CCI opposed BMW's plea saying the final order has already been passed, so addressal of the petition should be before the Competition Appellate Tribunal.

Activists plan to shut down NY stock exchangeClimate activists take on 'Wall Street,' but can't reach NY Stock Exchange

Thousands rally for climate change action
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Hundreds of environmentalists marched in New York's financial district on Monday to protest the relationship between global warming and Big Business.
The protesters blocked traffic as they staged a sit-in and shouted slogans on climate change. But they couldn't march on the actual Wall Street after running into barricades and had to abandon plans to "shut down" the New York Stock Exchange.
At the event, dubbed #FloodWallStreet , the marchers surrounded the iconic bull statue in lower Manhattan and chanted slogans demanding "climate justice" and carried signs saying "Corporate capitalism = climate chaos."
Their beef: the fossil fuels industry and other companies are profiting at the expense of the environment. The activists said they were willing to be arrested to drive home the link between global capitalism and worsening climate change. However, there weren't reports of any arrests by early afternoon.

"The climate crisis is fundamentally an issue of the economy," one activist told CNN. "Flood Wall Street is an attempt to bring the problem to the doorstep of the people who are fundamentally responsible for the crisis we find ourselves in now."
Organizers estimated that 2,500 people took part in the demonstration. They planned to remain in place until forced to leave.
Protesters unfurled a 300-foot banner that read "Flood Wall Street," and inflated two 15-foot "carbon bubbles." The atmosphere was boisterous, with protesters wearing costumes and dancing to the beat of a marching band.
The New York Police Department was out in full force, with some cops on horses.
Monday's demonstration comes one day after tens of thousands of people took part in the People's Climate March in New York City, which organizers said was the largest demonstration of its kind ever.
Related: Hey Occupy Wall Street, abolish my debt too!
In addition to environmentalists, the marchers on Sunday included labor activists and clergy, as well as celebrities and politicians.
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon walked with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore along the two-and-a-half mile route. Celebrity protesters included comedian Chris Rock, as well as actors Leonard DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo.
Rallies were also held in London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo and Bogota, Colombia.
Protesters are calling on world leaders to take more aggressive action to curb the emissions of greenhouse gasses.
Global leaders will gather Tuesday in New York for a United Nations summit on climate change. The UN is not expected to take any major steps, but officials are hoping to create momentum for a bigger commitment next year.

CCI rejects complaint against IrdaCCI rejects complaint against Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 25, 2014  | 15:19 IST

Fair trade watchdog CCI has rejected charges that insurance regulator Irda's rules, which grant of corporate agency license to banks to sell insurance products, are anti-competitive.
In an order, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said that "the issue of abuse of dominance by Irda does not arise and no case of contravention of the provisions of the (Competition) Act is made out against Irda and the information is ordered to be closed forthwith".
A complaint filed with the Commission had alleged that banks in insurance retailing sector were imposing unfair and discriminatory conditions on financed clients to purchase insurance product from them, indulging in predatory pricing, restricting and denying market access to independent insurance agents, among others.
As a result, the complainant had asked the fair trade watchdog to pass directions to Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) to repeal the regulation.
CCI noted in the case that Irda was discharging its regulatory and statutory mandate and did not fall within the purview of Competition norms.
"Regulatory actions are not per se amenable to the jurisdiction of the Commission," CCI said in the order dated September 12.
Under the Irda norm, banks have been granted corporate agency license to operate in insurance retailing.
It was believed that such retailing would raise competition which in turn benefits consumers in terms of increased access to insurance products, increase in the quality of services, among others.

ProofX aims for better medical models through 3D software  printingTake a little piece of my heart? ProofX makes 3D printed medical models technical, personal
How ProofX aims to blend 3D software, printing to build better medical models
'Every day we're learning something.' ProofX pursues better medical models with 3D printing
Say “commercial 3D printing” and most people conjure a picture of whirring printers building knickknacks, fashioning toy robots, or, on the high end, producing expensive hyper-engineered parts for engine manufacturers.
ProofX co-founders Nuha Nazy and Dima Elissa set out to make a better pair of shoes.
It was a literal business pain-point: Nazy’s friend has spina bifida and required a new pair of custom $5,000 shoes twice a year.
The quest to build their artist friend a funkier, faster pair of boots has taken the pair into deeper medical territory.
3D printing as a tool for medical procedures
ProofX CEO Dima Elissa shows an example of a 3D model that can be used as a tool for both medical professionals and the patients.

“Every day we’re learning something,” said Elissa, the company’s CEO. "We’re not linear thinkers."
Today, their company works to prototype better forceps for eye surgeons, lifelike models of a patient’s spinal column for medical students and, lately, tweaking a process that converts pre-surgery MRI scans into 3D models of soft tissue that are accurate enough for surgeons to find weak spots they might have missed on a flat screen.
“It’s been in the planning stage for years, but now people can see it and hold it,” Elissa said in an Illinois Medical District lab space complete with dumpster-sized 3D printers, white-boarded anatomy lessons and shelves of printed medical odds and ends. “It’s just bubbling to the surface, and you’re seeing people become aware of it.”
ProofX is one year old this month, and through it, Nazy and Elissa have been exploring the alternate universe offered by additive manufacturing to people who make things that are complex, specialized and customized.
Global market research company Markets and Markets credits the rapid development of new procedures in 3D printing as the force behind an additive manufacturing market that expands at 13.5 percent a year and is estimated to top $3.5 billion by 2017. Most of that growth has been in industrial business machines, consumer products and motor vehicles, according to the 2014 Wohlers Report on Additive Manufacturing and 3D Printing.
Models and implants for use in medical and dental procedures rounded out the top five applications of the last year, the Wohlers study found.
But the report and industry participants say that regulatory issues, product complexity and a dearth of reliable processes have made medical applications a market where early additive manufacturers have feared to tread, kicky custom boots or not.
Against that background, Nuha and Elissa have charted a course that makes models and simple tools for surgeons — medically related products that don’t need regulatory approval and which keep them close to the industry as the Chicago startup grows.

Five Things People Do to Hurt Their Careers -- And How to Stop Doing Themreddit
Happiness within the modern workplace is improving, sure. We talk less about discrimination, and we're getting closer to equal pay regardless of gender. But that doesn't mean that workers are thriving unhindered. The big difference is that these days, the barrier to advancing is more likely to be self-constructed. That's right: Your own worst workplace nemesis is you.
Maybe it's a lack of confidence to demand the salary you're worth or the promotion you deserve. Maybe you're risk-averse, and inclined to hand over the high-profile (and high-visibility) assignments to someone else. Maybe you don't have a mentor. Maybe you aren't a mentor yourself.
But more than ever, each of us is a brand, in competition with other brands, and in order to succeed, it's important to learn to stop getting in your own way; to create your own path. Here are the top worst mistakes modern workers make, and ways to avoid falling prey to the same traps yourself.
1. Not Marketing Yourself
Most people know that marketing is an essential part of moving up in the workplace, and yet they hold back. The reason: They don't want to be seen as bragging about themselves. But there are plenty of ways to further your personal brand -- and to get the recognition -- without grandstanding. The first step is to be sure you can define and understand your brand: what you can offer, who needs to know about you and why. Be clear and direct about the benefits you offer. If you're simply stating the facts -- to the relevant people -- it'll be hard to take that as being needlessly self-promotional. It's only when you talk about your achievements to someone for whom those achievements aren't relevant that you can sound boastful.
Another approach to indirect, non-braggy marketing is to work to be included on the big and difficult projects. Those are the jobs that bring visibility. At the very least, try to be on cross-functional teams and projects so that people outside your workplace inner circle get to see you in action. Or take on "extra credit" work like writing articles or finding speaking opportunities. Just be sure the extra work isn't the kind where you're in a room working on something that gets you zero exposure. Pick things where the extra work will be recognized.
And lastly, but most critically, do a great job. There's no better marketing tool than a good reputation. Take pride in your work by paying attention to every detail. Avoid careless moves like being late or missing deadlines. As Johnny Carson once said, "Talent alone won't make you a success."
2.  Having Sub-par Communication Skills
One timeless and industry-neutral piece of advice I give to employees of all ages is to learn to be the best communicator you can be. I talk to a lot of people in senior positions, and everyone agrees that ill communication is the biggest problem among employees today, particularly among those just coming out of college. People simply aren't prepared to create and convey a point of view. But sloppy communications hurt you. Clear communications, on the other hand, make you stand out.
Technology is surely partly to blame. We email and we text, and we use shorthand that's getting ever shorter, and as a result we're losing our skills in clear, concise expression. One way to reverse this trend is to use every opportunity you have to speak in front of groups. Presentation skills are like muscles. They need to be stressed if they're going to get stronger. And, like running or lifting weights, the more you do it, the easier it gets, the more you can take on, and the more accomplished you become.
In written communication, meanwhile, again it's critical to take pride in your work. Treat every memo as a reflection of your brand. Is it clear? Is it concise? Is it organized? Is the grammar perfect? It must be all of these things.
3. Refusing to "Lead Like [Insert Opposite Gender Here]"
Lately, many women have rebelled against the idea of "working like a man." But while I support the general intention -- women certainly don't need to be "like a man" in order to be successful -- the fact is that, woman or man, there are always things we can learn from the other gender to help advance our careers. Men are, as a whole, assertive, aggressive, task-oriented, risk taking, dominating, and competitive. Women, meanwhile, are instinctual, nurturing, collaborative, communicative, and responsive. There are some excellent qualities in here that both genders can and should adopt. The fact is that all of one -- all "male" traits -- or all of the other -- all "female" traits -- is not how to lead.
Which means that you can and should pick and choose from among these traits to use what works for you both personally and professionally. Some of the best advice I've ever heard on the topic of "how to be at work" is to know who you are -- and to be that. Don't try to adopt a style that doesn't fit. That said, your ideal workplace persona is very likely a blend of both masculine and feminine traits. Don't reject something that could work just because it may be how someone of the opposite sex "would do it." That there are variations all along the continuum is what makes us individuals, and human.
4. Problematically People-Pleasing
Worried that your assertiveness will be interpreted negatively? This is a mistake more commonly made among women, although men, in trying to be "the nice guy" or being reluctant to brag, often make it, too. But being firm and being nice are not mutually exclusive. You can, and should, be both. Think clearly and dispassionately about fights worth having. Don't create unnecessary drama. (You know exactly what I mean.) Sometimes our self-doubts cause us to go into situations with our fists clenched: "Do unto others before they have the chance to do it to you." We create conflicts we don't have to -- at home, at work. Stop doing that.
At the same time, also think clearly before backing down. It's easy to rationalize the caving in after the fact: "It's not worth it." "I'd lose anyway."  "I don't want to make enemies." But non-confrontation can become a habit that is hard to break. And most successful people learn, very early on, that if everybody in an organization likes you, you're probably not in charge of anything. Being in charge means decisions. And decisions mean somebody is not going to like what you decide.
Look for the win-win if you can. But don't let that, or a need to people-please, stand in the way of the best decision. It's better to look hard than it is to look soft.
5. Going Mentor-less
One way to stop career progress fast is to try to go it on your own. Finding a mentor -- and being a mentor -- is critical. And yet most workers are reluctant to ask for mentors, even when they want them. For those searching for a mentor, the key is to look beyond someone who can give you advice. Find a champion, and make yourself valuable enough to warrant his or her time. Mentoring is one thing, but finding someone with actual follow through -- someone who will advocate for you -- is quite another. It's the difference between talk and action.
At the same time, once you have something to teach, become a mentor to someone else. Mentors get nearly as much from being teachers as their students do from being mentored. You may be afraid to give those below you too much good advice, for fear of being replaced. That's a common fear. But being able to tap into the younger worker's brain, community, and connections is invigorating. Knowing "what the kids are thinking" is what helps keep the veterans on their toes, and thinking fresh. And that's what career progress is all about, isn't it?

Apple iPhone New Year's Day
Apple Inc's latest phone lured throngs of gadget lovers, entrepreneurs and early adapters to its stores in New York, San Francisco and other cities around the world in the latest sign of strong initial demand for the new, larger generation of iPhones.
Even the night before the phones' Friday debut, nearly 70 people were waiting in line in front of the Apple store in downtown San Francisco. Some eager to get their hands on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which feature larger screens and longer battery life, had been there since the night before.

At the Apple store on Fifth Avenue in New York, the line of would-be buyers stretched for more than 10 blocks. Apple employees led them in a New Year's Eve-style countdown to herald the store's opening at 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) and high-fived customers as they entered the glass cube leading to the underground store. 
In Atlanta, police were called in before 5:30 a.m. to assist with crowd control at one mall location because of worries about trampling, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. 
While it has become customary for swarms of people to greet Apple product introductions, Friday's long lines were still a sign of healthy demand for the new models. The phones drew more than 4 million preorder requests in the first 24 hours on Sept. 12, more than double the 2 million for iPhone 5s in the same period two years ago.
The enthusiastic crowds gathered despite signs that Apple's legendary "cool factor" may be dimming with some consumers, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. 
Sales predictions from investors tend to be optimistic. Apple watchers tracking the early sales of the new iPhones note that the precise number of units sold in the first weekend will depend on the strength of the supply chain. A Friday report from Barclays cited the long lines outside stores as a positive sign for demand, suggesting that combined first-weekend sales for the new phones could rise as high as 11 million units.
Despite the high demand, sales could be choked by a limited number of iPhone 6 Pluses available immediately. A T-Mobile US Inc spokeswoman said Friday that demand for the new phones was "tremendous," but the larger model would not be available yet.

The People s Climate March: Join Us On September 21 To Make Historyreddit
An old friend recently got in touch to let me know he'll be joining me at the People's Climate March in New York City this weekend. He's coming from pretty far out of town, and he's not the type some people would consider a traditional climate activist. But he's making the effort to join us. To me, that's what this march is about. The realization that climate change touches all our lives, and that none of us can afford to be complacent about it. That's why thousands of people, young and old, from all walks of life, will be raising our voices together to demand climate action.
This will be the largest climate march in history, and the timing is key: We will take to the streets on Sunday, September 21, just as world leaders begin to gather in New York City for the U.N. Climate Summit.
Our presence will demonstrate the groundswell of support for climate action that has grown around the country and across communities. More than 1,100 organizations, including community, labor, environmental justice, faith and progressive groups will be participating in the March to demand action on climate change. Every single U.S. state will be represented. Students from more than 300 college campuses are mobilizing to come to New York.
This diverse group of concerned citizens is united by a desire to see a more just and sustainable future. Another friend and colleague, a litigator like me, is also coming to march. He and I successfully argued one of the two cases that led to Supreme Court rulings which established the EPA's authority to limit carbon pollution from power plants. You bet we want to see the EPA use that authority to cut power plant pollution and protect our health.
And we are both marching because we know that the EPA's Clean Power Plan is being attacked ferociously by the fossil fuel industry; this march will make clear to our policy makers that they should listen to the vast majority of people who want a clean future, not the few who profit from the dirty present.
My friend who's coming from far outside the city works in land conservation. Back in the day, land conservation and climate change were considered separate concerns. They attracted different supporters. Now, the urgency and reach of the climate problem is bringing all of us together.
Climate has a tremendous impact on land conservation -- just think of the coastlines being swallowed by sea level rise. Areas that have been preserved as habitat for certain species will soon no longer be suitable habitat -- they may become too warm, too wet, or invaded by new species that thrive in the new environment. Wetlands dry up. Plant and animal species that have been brought back from the brink of extinction by conservation efforts may end up in peril, once again.
But land conservation in turn can also limit climate damage. Protected forests help soak up carbon, and open lands likewise help soak up heavy rainfall and floodwaters, reducing the impacts of extreme weather.
My daughter invited her friends to join her at the march -- she'll be celebrating her birthday there with a cast of thousands. Young people like her are marching because they are the generation that will bear the brunt of the consequences if world leaders continue to kick the can down the road instead of facing up to our shared responsibilities.
Climate change -- and efforts to curb it -- affect us all.
All of us are marching -- conservationists, litigators, old school and new blood, labor and faith, moms and kids -- not just to draw attention to the problem, but because we're all part of the solution, too. Action to combat climate change will clean up air pollution so kids breathe easier; it creates good, local jobs in clean energy and energy efficiency -- hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States alone; it means better transportation systems with more choices to get from one place to another; it means cooler, greener, walkable neighborhoods that are more pleasant to live in; it means we are finally stepping up to protect future generations from a legacy of rising seas, storms, dirty air, droughts and heat waves.
Citizen action is a powerful force for change. When so many of us, from so many disparate backgrounds, ages and interests, take to the streets together, our message cannot be ignored. We need swift, decisive solutions that will stabilize the climate and protect our future.
Join the People's Climate March on September 21 in New York City. Show the leaders of the world as they gather at the UN a clear message: The people demand bold climate action, now.

Better Board Governance. Is It the Same for Both Business and Nonprofit Organizationsreddit
Both BoardSource in 2012* and the Charted Global Management Accountant (CGMA) in 2012** have issued reports on improving board governance. The former group focuses on nonprofit boards and the latter focuses on business boards globally.*** Both the nonprofit and business organization reports listed the following prime areas for board improvement or focus:The CGMA report called for improved strategy development & risk analysis; better boardroom behaviors; better relationships between board & management. The BoardSource report asked for improved focus on strategy, with much less emphasis on operations; more board commitment, engagement, & attendance; better self-assessment, recruitment & development.
Although the CGMA report does not differentiate the types (strategic vs. operational strategy) the "risk oversight" notation can indicate there is a need for greater board focus on long-term strategy. For nonprofit boards, the strategic side of planning is often neglected. There has been a decades-long board culture support for directors' involvement in operational decisions, often leading to board micromanagement and less strategic interest.
In contrast to the CGMA report, poor boardroom behaviors are specified in the BoardSource report. These include substantial proportions of directors failing to coach and teach one another; conversations at board meetings being driven by a few individuals and failure of board members to help develop each other's strengths. It can be hypothesized that many of these misbehavior patterns are also found within business boards. This is surprising since most of the business directors are independent ones who receive compensation.
Although the Sarbanes-Oxley Act strongly suggests that business directors develop interpersonal relationships with managers to better understand organization operations, it doesn't seem to be happening on an international basis, according to the CGMA analysis. Relatedly, for nonprofits, there seems to be a need for more board self-assessment and development that can quietly highlight inadequate relationships.
Several modest contrasts between the two entities reside in the relationship between board and staff. Many nonprofits are small organizations, with the staff being only one or two organizational levels below the board. In addition, nonprofit board members have much shorter terms then their corporate counterparts, usually with terms anywhere from two years or less to six years. As a result the staff watches this churn closely. It is concerned that a new influential director or two can make significant differences in their work lives. (Example: Two new directors from an academic institution quickly persuaded their colleagues that the organization needed an extensive management-by-objectives program. As a result the staff had to spend substantial unproductive time completing forms and reviewing them. This went on for three or four years.) As a result, NFP directors need to use opportunities at celebrations and on board-staff committees to become personally acquainted with staff members.
There are certainly differences between nonprofit and for-profit boards in terms of mission, vision and values, but both boards appear to need to improve in operationally similar manners.

Chinese President Xi Jinping addressing an Indian Council of World Affairs function in New Delhi last Thursday. - PTI
China now views itself as an emerging superpower rather than a ‘developing’ country. India should take this into account
Long after President Xi Jinping has flown back to Beijing, there will remain a host of prickly issues that senior ministers and diplomats on both sides will need to bang heads over. During President Xi’s 48-hour whistle-stop through Ahmedabad and Delhi, the climate-controlled atmospherics, the fastidiously choreographed diplomatic pas de deux on Sabarmati, the thunderous rhetoric and the flurry of MoUs made for good optics. But action is always a poor substitute for achievement.
One of the visible thorns in the blossoming relationship is border uncertainty and both President Xi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi did reiterate a need to settle it. But beyond the omnipresent irritation of a virtual border, it is in India’s interest to resolve numerous pending geo-economic issues with China.
Shifts and moves
Start with World Trade Organisation (WTO) first. India invited universal censure after blocking safe passage of Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) at WTO’s General Council meeting in Geneva on July 31, 2014. However, China’s unprincipled floor-crossing on that day was truly shocking, after having supported India’s stand in many multilateral fora (such as G-33, G-20) and in bilateral meetings.
China’s mercurial shift could be understandable if India was found to be acting irrationally. But, on closer analysis, it seems India’s actions were justified. Having agreed at the Bali ministerial to approve TFA, on condition that developing countries not be penalised for food security imperatives till a permanent solution is formalised by 2017, India discovered that all discussions thereafter were focused on only TFA. This was contrary to the post-Bali work programme and gave India (and some other developing countries) grounds to believe that once TFA was out of the way, rich countries didn't care much for the Doha Development Agenda, including food security measures.
But, there are some other valid reasons for India’s principled action. For one, India has a sovereign right to provide food security for its citizens, just as US has the right to buy and stockpile crude oil to provide its citizens with energy security. Two, TFA will cause a spike in infrastructure costs for poor countries; the rich nations were to provide budgetary assistance to help them tide over this unplanned expense, but the amount finalised is too low and the modalities are still vague.
Finally, benefits from TFA are ambiguous, with most gains likely to go to the developed world.
China’s sovereign objectives are somewhat aligned with India on this issue, particularly since it too has to provide food at reasonable prices for large sections of its population. Also, China has been a signatory to all the food security negotiations by G-33, a grouping of developing countries with convergent trade issues.
A change of heart?
While it’s not known if Modi-Xi talks included China’s breach of trust, the joint statement issued by both governments was patently anodyne: “As developing countries, India and China have common interests on several issues of global importance like climate change, Doha Development Round of WTO, energy and food security, reform of the international financial institutions and global governance. This is reflected in close cooperation and coordination between the two sides within the BRICS, G-20 and other fora.”
One reason for China’s change of heart could be India’s lackadaisical communications strategy; also, India’s parleys could have conveyed a message that it’s interested in cherry-picking only food stockpiling from a multitude of other development issues. This might have even influenced some of the other large emerging nations, such as Brazil and South Africa, to isolate India.
But there’s another significant development. There's probably a radical shift in how China views itself: as a world superpower and a trade behemoth, competing with the developed countries. Hence, in keeping with this new-found status, TFA makes more sense rather than hankering for food security. While China is indeed a trade colossus, India needs to keep in mind this change in China’s self-perception when negotiating with President Xi’s men in future.
The border incursion, intriguingly timed to coincide with President Xi’s visit, is a reminder of China’s foreign policy dualism: an extended hand of economic friendship to mask the ugly face of geographic expansionism.
The second issue is climate change and India would do well to keep the new Chinese psyche in mind in future multilateral deliberations.
On the surface, both India and China seem to be on the same page. Apart from a common historical stand, both President Xi and PM Modi have also excused themselves from the UN Climate Summit on September 23.
But that’s where the similarities end. China has already signed a separate climate change agreement with US. While these agreements reduce the climate policy distance between the two superpowers, there are still some sticking points. While China and US agree that that rich countries must provide developing nations with wherewithal to upgrade technology, the divergence is whether the old labels of “developing” or “developed” need to be upgraded.
In essence, the rest of the world’s identity — including India’s — is hostage to progress of talks between two superpowers. The initiative seems to be slipping away from India’s grasp; a climate change strategy is required before the big climate summit in Paris next year. While China’s stand may be driven by thickening smog over its cities, India may have to fashion its own position consistent with its economy and stage of development.
Myriad issues
There are many other unresolved issues on the table — using renminbi as a alternative currency, India’s membership in multilateral institutions (such as Asian Investment Infrastructure Bank) and groupings (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, for example), discussions on how to take the BRICS Bank ahead, enhanced market access for Indian goods and services, are just some of them.
The lessons for Modi are clear: with China what you see is never what you get. Modi will have to take every opportunity to create an independent policy space for india, even if that requires striking trade and investment deals with Japan, USA, EU, Russia or Australia.

Focus on revival of units  not asset-strippingFocus on revival of units, not asset-stripping

With care: Reconstruction is an art yogo/shutterstock.com
Reconstruction firms are merely interested in getting properties on the cheap. The approach to bad debts needs to change
There has been a recent surge in banks selling off their distressed assets to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs). There is a general perception that this has been spurred mainly by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) relaxing some provisioning norms.
But this is open to question. Banks are better equipped in terms of manpower, knowledge of the borrower and knowledge of security (assets). On the other hand, ARCs deal with the borrowers for the first time.
Restructuring of loans, on the condition that the promoters infuse some capital, can be done without banks incurring much loss. Banks can recover the losses later once the company turns around and/or the economic conditions improve. That has been the time-tested practice in the country. But none of the public sector lenders are seen doing this nowadays.
The fear factor
What I observe is that on account of the fear psychosis of an investigation later on by an outside agency, the banks prefer to adopt ARC route. It was expected that all ARCs will have sufficient funds to takeover bad debts and they will develop a mechanism to resolve the same within a shorter timeframe (currently, the time is 8 years, which is too long). The aim was to protect the interests of banks, ARCs and other stakeholders.
However, the majority of ARCs are interested in getting assigned debt that is backed by substantial fixed assets. At the same time, banks are also keen to retain such assets as they expect to recover more from such borrowers themselves. That way, both of them are fighting for the same asset class.
Unfortunately, ARCs are supported mostly by real estate barons, whose main aim is to grab real estate assets rather than initiating any purposeful restructuring or recycling of assets.
So, ARCs should be told that once they get the debt assigned from banks, they should reappraise and re-examine the viability of the project with a reasonable internal rate of return , over a period of 10-15 years. If the unit is found viable, the lenders should evolve a proper monitoring mechanism by appointing financial experts. This will help recycle the NPAs.
Once the project is reappraised, the assets should be classified as ‘standard’ and the borrower and the banks that were not part of the earlier lenders’ group should also be given an opportunity for further funding (the company and promoter should keep on reinvesting the proceeds of the business).
Help at hand
This will go a long way in creating competition and further reducing bad debts. Besides, these steps will help create more employment opportunities and revenue for the Government.
This process will save ARCs from becoming bankrupt due to lack of enough liquidity and/or their inability to resolve NPAs apace.
The State Bank of India chairman’s observations in favour of entrusting the management of industries to outside agencies with full powers, as was suggested in the case of Bhushan Steel, to supervise the day-to-day operations till the promoter-directors infuse substantial stake into the company, is appreciable.
Instead of the bank appointing a nominee, the chairman or MD of the bank be appointed as the chairman of a sick company to run its operations. That will be a real test and this would protect the interests of all stakeholders, as in the case of Satyam Computers.
Till such time, the existing promoters should not be allowed to access bank funds for any other ventures. This will create a deterrent. Therefore, an enabling provision has to be made in the Companies Act, Sarfaesi Act and ARC Act — that as soon as the assets are assigned in favour of ARC, the existing board and shareholder’s powers are suspended and will be revived only when the promoter directors bring in substantial funding.
At that juncture, ARCs should reassess the viability of the project after considering substantial reduction in debt. In other words, if such portion of the debt is scaled down, if reasonable IRR concept is introduced, the purpose of revival of the unit is beneficial, rather than ARCs looking for fixed assets as real estate ventures.
For this, a framework for ARCs has to be stipulated. ARCs should be encouraged to engage professionals not only for resolution of bad debts, but also for running the units.
This will really serve the intention of the Government for the revival of sick units as well as resolving the problem of bad debts. The resolution of bad debts itself should not start from the day it becomes a NPA, but it should be monitored during the implementation of the project.
After initiating these efforts, ARCs and banks should invite expression of interest for takeover of these assets as a going concern.
This will also create huge value for the assets of the defaulting company.
Till such time, promoters should not be allowed to interfere. This will also give an opportunity to make good all the sacrifices made by the banks and the Government.
Recent guidelines of the RBI which insist on takeout financing route will also help the cause of revival of sick units.

Why Ordinary People Bear Economic Risks and Donald Trump Doesntreddit
Thirty years ago, on its opening day in 1984, Donald Trump stood in a dark topcoat on the casino floor at Atlantic City's Trump Plaza, celebrating his new investment as the finest building in Atlantic City and possibly the nation .
Last week, the Trump Plaza folded and the Trump Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy, leaving some 1,000 employees without jobs.
Trump, meanwhile, was on Twitter claiming he had "nothing to do with Atlantic City," and praising himself for his "great timing" in getting out of the investment.
In America, people with lots of money can easily avoid the consequences of bad bets and big losses by cashing out at the first sign of trouble.
The laws protect them through limited liability and bankruptcy.
But workers who move to a place like Atlantic City for a job, invest in a home there, and build their skills, have no such protection. Jobs vanish, skills are suddenly irrelevant, and home values plummet.
They're stuck with the mess.
Bankruptcy was designed so people could start over. But these days, the only ones starting over are big corporations, wealthy moguls, and Wall Street.
Corporations are even using bankruptcy to break contracts with their employees. When American Airlines went into bankruptcy three years ago, it voided its labor agreements and froze its employee pension plan .
After it emerged from bankruptcy last year and merged with U.S. Airways, America's creditors were fully repaid, its shareholders came out richer than they went in, and its CEO got a severance package valued at $19.9 million .
But American's former employees got shafted.
Wall Street doesn't worry about failure, either. As you recall, the Street almost went belly up six years ago after risking hundreds of billions of dollars on bad bets.
A generous bailout from the federal government kept the bankers afloat. And since then, most of the denizens of the Street have come out just fine.
Yet more than 4 million American families have so far have lost their homes. They were caught in the downdraft of the Street's gambling excesses.
They had no idea the housing bubble would burst, and didn't read the fine print in the mortgages the bankers sold them.
But they weren't allowed to declare bankruptcy and try to keep their homes.
When some members of Congress tried to amend the law to allow homeowners to use bankruptcy, the financial industry blocked the bill.
There's no starting over for millions of people laden with student debt, either.
Student loan debt has more than doubled since 2006, from $509 billion to $1.3 trillion . It now accounts for 40 percent of all personal debt -- more than credit card debts and auto loans.
But the bankruptcy law doesn't cover student debts. The student loan industry made sure of that.
If former students can't meet their payments, lenders can garnish their paychecks. (Some borrowers, still behind by the time they retire, have even found chunks taken out of their Social Security checks.)
The only way borrowers can reduce their student debt burdens is to prove in a separate lawsuit that repayment would impose an "undue hardship" on them and their dependents.
This is a stricter standard than bankruptcy courts apply to gamblers trying to reduce their gambling debts.
You might say those who can't repay their student debts shouldn't have borrowed in the first place. But they had no way of knowing just how bad the jobs market would become. Some didn't know the diplomas they received from for-profit colleges weren't worth the paper they were written on.
A better alternative would be to allow former students to use bankruptcy where the terms of the loans are clearly unreasonable (including double-digit interest rates, for example), or the loans were made to attend schools whose graduates have very low rates of employment after graduation.
Economies are risky. Some industries rise and others implode, like housing. Some places get richer, and others drop, like Atlantic City. Some people get new jobs that pay better, many lose their jobs or their wages.
The basic question is who should bear these risks. As long as the laws shield large investors while putting the risks on ordinary people, investors will continue to make big bets that deliver jackpots when they win but create losses for everyone else.
Average working people need more fresh starts. Big corporations, banks, and Donald Trump need fewer.

Amit Shah calls Uddhav as BJP  Shiv Sena bicker over seat sharingComments
The deadlock over seat-sharing between the BJP and the Shiv Sena continued Monday but the alliance partners appeared willing to accommodate each other’s concerns, keeping hopes of reconciliation alive.
The BJP sent a fresh proposal to the Shiv Sena, offering to contest 130 seats -- five down from its initial demand of 135 --- in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly but also hinted it was ready to go it alone.
A day after it made the senior ally the “final offer” of 119 seats, the Sena -– through informal channels -- indicated it was willing to concede another six seats to the BJP, sources said. The Sena had Sunday set aside 151 seats for itself.
For weeks, the saffron combine has been fighting bitterly over the number of seats each party will contest in the October 15 state election.
The alliance fancies its chances this time and whichever party gets more seats, will also get the CM’s post.
“In a contingent situation that the BJP is compelled not to contest with the Shiv Sena, we would go it alone on all 288 seats but we will prefer that Shiv Sena comes along,” BJP general secretary in-charge for Maharashtra Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.

The BJP, said sources, was yet to receive a formal response from Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on its fresh demand for 130 seats.
“We have shown some flexibility... Sena should give us those seats where chances of its victory are nil.” There are some 59 seats that the Sena has not won in last five elections.
Late Sunday, the party’s central election committee had finalised candidates for more than 200 seats, sources said. In case of a split, the BJP would “accommodate” the three smaller parties that are part of the Mahayuti, or the grand alliance, the sources said.
Rudy has been asked go to Mumbai and settle things in the next two-three days. September 27 is the last day of filing election papers. The party’s election in-charge Om Mathur is already in Mumbai.
 
Thackeray had called up two senior BJP leaders on Sunday, but failed to secure any concession, a BJP leader told HT. The party, said sources, would wait for the “inauspicious” Pitrapaksha to end -- on September 24 --before announcing candidates.

The BJP leaders say they want the alliance to work but a break-up with Sena wouldn’t put the party at a disadvantage.
“We will get an opportunity to make inroads in urban areas where Modi magic will give us an advantage,” a BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.
Rudy earlier said that his party had sent “a very liberal proposal” to Sena as the 130 seats include the “worst” possible seats which its ally had never won in last 30 years. Traditionally, the Shiv Sena has fought more seats than the BJP, which wants a bigger share this time following its Lok Sabha victory.

BSE sensex
(The index is now close to…)
NEW DELHI: With the US Federal Reserve uncertainty out of the way, the Indian markets are well placed to surpass their previous record highs on both the Sensex and the Nifty in the next few trading sessions.
Both the Sensex and the Nifty touched their respect record highs on September 8, 2014. The S&P BSE Sensex' record high is placed at 27354.99 and the life high of the 50-share Nifty index is placed at 8180.20.
Fresh buying and a bout of short-coverings helped the Nifty cross the 8,100 mark this week. The index is now close to its all-time high and the momentum suggests that the Nifty will soon hit a fresh high.
Fitch Ratings on Monday also said that US Fed interest rate hike - which could be expected by mid-2015 - will not cause a major disruption in emerging markets (EMs), including India. According to Fitch, India's credit profile is much stronger than other EM peers.
According to experts, valuations of the Indian markets are still not very high. Nifty P/E is at 16, which is substantially lower than its high of 25.
"Since May, I have stood by my forecast of the Sensex hitting 30,000 by the year of 2014. We can expect some slowdown in the markets in the first quarter of 2015 as FII inflows come to a standstill and the US raises its Federal Funds rate," said Raghu Kumar, Cofounder of RKSV.
"I would expect a quarterly growth of 3-5 per cent, which would pin the Sensex at around 31,500 by the end of March and 35,000 at the end of the 2015," he added.
We have collated a list of five less-known stocks where brokerages have initiated coverage in the month of September. These stocks have the potential to deliver up to 63 per cent return in the next 12-18 months:
Kitex Garments: Target Price set at Rs 615
Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on the Kochi-based stock with a 'buy' recommendation. The stock has already rallied nearly 500 per cent so far in the year 2014.
The company is in the business of manufacturing and exporting infant garments. It derives 85 per cent of its revenue from the sale of infant garments and the balance 15 per cent from the sale of fabric to Kitex Childrenwear.
KTG is in the process of adding some large clients in FY15 apart from deepening business with existing clients like Gerber, Toys R Us, Jockey, Mothercare and Carter's.
"Going forward, KTG intends to improve its revenue mix in favor of high margin clients like Toys R Us, Jockey and Mothercare, who procure high value-added products which will drive continued margin improvement," the report said.
"We expect KTG to post a 24.6 per cent revenue CAGR coupled with a 700bp margin expansion over FY14-FY17E. Hence, we expect PAT to post 40 per cent CAGR over FY14-17E. With 60 per cent capacity utilization currently, we expect ramp-up of existing capacities and minimal expansion capex," the report said.
"Given strong balance sheet and significant free cash flows, RoCE and RoE should improve from 37 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively, to 58 per cent and 39 per cent over FY14-17E," the report added.
 
Pennar Industries Ltd: Target price set at Rs 81
Midcap steel company Pennar Industries is in a strong bull run. The stock has surged over 140 per cent so far in the year 2014 and the rally is set to continue as the economic activity picks up, say analysts.
IndiaNivesh sees immense potential in the stock in the next 12 months. They value the stock at a conservative PE multiple of 10x to FY16E EPS (Rs. 8.1), which gives the target price of Rs 81.
Steel products business is expected to grow to more than Rs 450 crore in FY15. The company is expecting double-digit growth in the railways business in FY15. As of now, the railways business has an order book of Rs 120 crore.
All verticals of the company are generating positive cash flows and the management is confident of increasing cash profits in FY15 vs the previous fiscal.
According to the brokerage, corporate action by the company on getting subsidiary (PEBS) separately listed on exchanges could be the additional trigger. Pennar Industries is trading at P/E multiple of 8.8x FY15E and 5.9x FY16E earnings estimate, which is well below 14.3x - three-year historical average.
"Average ROE for the company in the past three years has been 12.9 per cent. In FY15E and FY16E, the ROE of the company is likely to improve to 16.4 per cent and 20.3 per cent respectively on the back of increased capacity utilization and margin expansion," the report said.
Century Plyboard: Target price set at Rs 156
Century Plyboard (CPBI) is India's leading plywood producer with the highest volume and revenue. CPBI and Greenply dominate the organised plywood market with a combined 50% market share. CPBI commands 5 per cent premium over its nearest brand and 20% premium over products of unorganised companies.
IIFL initiated coverage on Century Plyboard (CPBI) with a buy recommendation and one-year target of Rs156. They expect CPBI to record 40 per cent earnings CAGR over FY14-FY17.

CAG can t be blamed for UPA fall  says Vinod RaiPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 4:54 pm
Refuting allegations of having political leanings, former CAG Vinod Rai has said that “credit or blame” for the fall of UPA regime cannot be squarely put on the apex auditor.
Rai – whose latest book ‘Not Just an Accountant’ – has triggered a political controversy, asserted that too much credit is being given to two or three audit findings and the Supreme Court rulings.
It is perceived that CAG findings in the cases of 2G spectrum and coal block allocations were among the major factors for the Congress-led UPA losing the general elections.
“I think it is giving too much of credit to two or three reports that came out or one or two decisions of Supreme Court because I think it is a very futile argument, just the way you said, that CAG has political leanings. When you have nothing to counter CAG on merit you say you have political leanings,” Rai told PTI in an interview.
The book touches upon happenings during Rai’s tenure from 2008-13 as the Comptroller and Auditor General as well as  about the role of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the previous UPA regime.
About allegations that his report was one of the reasons for the fall of Congress and rise of BJP, Rai said political parties should introspect on why the election results came the way it came.
“…it is (said) it is not the failings of the government but was reports of the CAG. I think it requires much more internal introspection for any of the political parties to do, I am not naming anybody, why the result came the way it came.
“I am certain that the credit or the blame cannot be squarely and only that of the reports of the CAG,” he noted.

Modi to stay at US Presidents official guest houseModi to stay at US President’s official guest house

Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 22:  
Narendra Modi will be the first Indian Prime Minister in over a decade to stay at the US President’s guest house — the 190-year-old Blair House — when he travels to Washington on September 29.
Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the last one to stay at the guest house.
“Built as a private home in 1824, Blair House has played an important role in nearly 190 years of American political, diplomatic and cultural history— from Andrew Jackson’s ’Kitchen Cabinet’, to private chats with Abraham Lincoln, to Harry S Truman’s crucial leadership as World War II ended and the Cold War began.
“Now, as then, US Presidents continue to rely on Blair House as a significant foreign policy tool,” as per the official information.
Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh never stayed in the Blair House and always preferred a hotel during his US visits.
The Blair House is the designated guest house of the US president where all his state guests are traditionally known to have stayed.
Located across from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, Blair House has served as the President’s Guest House since its purchase by the US government in World War II and under the stewardship of the Department of State, it welcomes visiting heads of states and other top dignitaries.
In New York, Modi, like Singh, will stay at the New York Palace Hotel in Manhattan when he arrives on September 26 late afternoon.
His first public engagement next day would be a visit to Ground Zero, the site of the World Trade Centre which was destroyed in the terror attacks by al—Qaeda in 2001 followed by a visit to the 9/11 Memorial Museum built in the honour of the victims of 2001 attacks.
Modi will then proceed towards the United Nations to deliver the speech at the General Assembly, scheduled in the first half of the day.
The Prime Minister will then have a series of bilateral meetings including one with his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina.
In the evening, Modi is scheduled to visit the Central Park where he will attend Global Citizen festival.
According to sources here, the Prime Minister will be meeting Jewish groups on September 28, the day on which he will also address thousands of Indian—Americans at the famous Madison Square Garden.
US President Barack Obama will host a dinner for Modi on his arrival in Washington on September 29 from New York.
Significantly, the US President’s dinner meet is not a usual practice and is normally accorded to foreign visitors on state visits.
The dinner meeting would be the first opportunity for Modi and Obama to interact with each other and will set the stage for the summit meeting on September 30.
Vice-President Joe Biden will host a working lunch for Modi on September 30 after which the Prime Minister will travel to Capitol Hill to meet House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner.
In Washington, DC, he will also meet businessmen at an event hosted by the US—India Business Council.

Jan Dhan Yojana: Union Bank engages Fino PayTech in GujaratAhmedabad, Sept 22:  
 
Union Bank of India (UBI) has engaged Fino PayTech in more than 400 villages in Gujarat to identity and enrol unbanked population under the Prime Minister’s Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY).
 
Already, UBI has enrolled more than 9,000 rural customers under the scheme in 41 villages of Gujarat.
 
With the latest numbers reporting four crore accounts opened under the PMJDY, there is growing concern over a single person opening multiple accounts. Following a directive from the RBI, banks have started to undertake massive exercises to identify and enrol the right persons eligible for a bank account under the scheme.
 
Taking the lead in Gujarat, UBI flagged off its national financial inclusion project in the districts of Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Junagadh where camps were held in 44 villages. A total of 9,500 hitherto unbanked people in these villages have been enrolled for new bank accounts.
 
Payments technology firm and leading business correspondent (BC) network operator, Fino PayTech is UBI’s partner in this endeavour. Together they intend to extend the project further in 400 more villages through BC network in Rajkot, Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Surat and Vadodara districts, Vikaas Goel, Vice-President, Fino PayTech, said on Monday.
 
Explaining the strategy for taking forward banking in rural areas, he said business correspondents brought about paradigm shift in the way rural banking was being conducted. The PMJDY further emphasises their strategic role in making financial inclusion possible. “To penetrate further in rural Gujarat we plan to hire over 200 agents who will identity and enroll the unbanked population for new bank accounts under the scheme.”
 
“Identification of an eligible household for a bank account is a major development compared to earlier efforts. We will undertake surveys to identify such households prior to enrollments. This will ensure quality of bank accounts and reduce wastages in terms of effort, cost and duplication,” added Goel.  
 
In addition to enrolling new bank accounts, the agents will also service the customers’ banking needs by providing access to various products such as savings, credit, insurance, RD/ FD and remittances. 
 
Apart from Gujarat, Fino is working with UBI on the PMJDY in UP, MP, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand, among other states, enrolling over 3.75 lakh people for new bank accounts. 
 
Fino PayTech is micro payments solutions provider to banks, financial institutions and MFIs. Together with its service delivery network of 28,000 transaction points it facilitates access to financial services to the unbanked and un-served segments of the population. It services over 2.80 crore active banking customers spread across India, providing a range of financial services like savings, remittance, insurance, credit etc.

Rupee ends flat at 60.82Rupee ends flat at 60.82
Our Bureau
Tweet
September 22, 2014:  
The rupee ended almost unchanged at 60.82 against the dollar amid thin volumes of trades ahead of the RBI monetary policy next week.
The domestic unit opened a tad weaker at 60.85 as angst the previous close of 60.83 per dollar on Friday.
It further depreciated by 3 paise to 60.86 against the US currency in early trade at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market today due to increased demand for the American currency from importers  amid a weak opening in the domestic equity market, which fell nearly 120 points.
However, the equity markets recovered with BSE-benchmark Sensex ending 116 points (0.43 per cent) to 27,207 at day’s close. Such capital flows and dollar selling by exporters supported the rupee to gain to 60.74 per dollar.
“The RBI will likely maintain its Rs 58-62 per dollar “range of tolerance” for USD/INR until it is able to build up sufficient FX reserves – close to 10 months’ import cover – which looks unlikely over our forecast horizon,” said Indranil Sen Gupta, chief economist, Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a report.
Call Rates and G-sec yields fall
The interbank call money rate, the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from one another, pared gains to end weaker at 7.20 per cent from Friday’s close of 7.75 per cent.
The price on the 10-year benchmark 8.40 per cent government security, maturing in 2024, closed higher at Rs 99.74 from the previous close of Rs 99.62. The yield on the bond further softened to 8.43 per cent from 8.45 per cent.
Bond prices and yields move in the opposite directions.

ISIS urge killing of citizens from US-led coalitionThe Islamic State group called on Muslims to kill citizens of all countries taking part in the US-led anti-jihadist coalition by any available means, in a statement posted online Monday.
   
"If you can kill a disbelieving American or European — especially the spiteful and filthy French — or an Australian, or a Canadian or any other disbeliever... including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him," said Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the group's spokesperson.
   
"Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military," he said in the message, which was released in multiple languages.
   
The United States and France are carrying out air strikes against IS targets across Iraq and seeking to build an international coalition against a group increasingly perceived as a global threat.
   
US secretary of state John Kerry said that more than 50 countries have come forward with commitments as part of the coalition, including Egypt and other Arab states.
   
The jihadist group, which has declared a "caliphate" straddling Iraq and Syria, controls swathes of territory in both countries.
   
IS has executed hundreds of Iraqis and Syrians, as well as foreign hostages, and its brutal campaign has forced more than a million people from their homes.
   
Adnani's message — which was released in an Arabic audio recording and transcripts in other languages including English — gave instructions on how the killings could be carried out without military equipment, using rocks or knives, or by running people over.
   
'A new era'
   
The hundreds of foreigners from various Western countries fighting alongside IS have sparked fears that they could return home to carry out attacks.
   
On Monday, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned that any of its citizens "who fight with terrorist groups... will be arrested, prosecuted and jailed for a very long time."
   
Adnani praised militants in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, calling on them to "cut the throats" of those fighting for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and saying Tunisians should follow their example.
   
He criticised Yemen for allowing Shiite Huthi rebels to enter the capital Sanaa, asking: "Is there not in Yemen a person who will take revenge for us (on) the Huthis?"
   
And he called on Muslims in Libya to unite, saying that "your division is from Satan."
   
"We are in a new era, an era where the (Islamic) State, its soldiers, and its sons are leaders, not slaves," Adnani said.
   
"We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted."
   
He also mocked the US air campaign, saying that "the battle cannot be decided from the air".
   
"Are America and all its allies from amongst the crusaders and atheists unable to come down to the ground?"
   
Addressing US President Barack Obama, Adnani said: "You claimed... that America would not be drawn to a war on the ground. No, it will be drawn and dragged. It will come down to the ground and it will be led to its death, grave, and destruction."

When administrative inspections of businesses turn into massive armed police raidsFrom Berry v. Leslie (11th Cir. Sept. 16, 2014) :
It was a scene right out of a Hollywood movie. On Aug. 21, 2010, after more than a month of planning, teams from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office descended on multiple target locations. They blocked the entrances and exits to the parking lots so no one could leave and no one could enter. With some team members dressed in ballistic vests and masks, and with guns drawn, the deputies rushed into their target destinations, handcuffed the stunned occupants — and demanded to see their barbers’ licenses. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office was providing muscle for the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation’s administrative inspection of barbershops to discover licensing violations.
We first held 19 years ago that conducting a run-of-the-mill administrative inspection as though it is a criminal raid, when no indication exists that safety will be threatened by the inspection, violates clearly established Fourth Amendment rights. See Swint v. City of Wadley, 51 F.3d 988 (11th Cir. 1995). We reaffirmed that principle in 2007 when we held that other deputies of the very same Orange County Sheriff’s Office who participated in a similar warrantless criminal raid under the guise of executing an administrative inspection were not entitled to qualified immunity. See Bruce v. Beary, 498 F.3d 1232 (11th Cir. 2007). Today, we repeat that same message once again. We hope that the third time will be the charm….
The Fourth Amendment guarantees “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” Its protections apply to “commercial premises, as well as to private homes.” In general, the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant supported by probable cause to effectuate a constitutional search. Indeed, this Court has explained, “The basic premise of search and seizure doctrine is that searches undertaken without a warrant issued upon probable cause are `per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment—subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.’”
One of those limited exceptions involves administrative inspections of “closely regulated” industries. Because an owner or operator of commercial property “has a reduced expectation of privacy” in this context, the standard for what may be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment is correspondingly broader.
To fall within this exception, a warrantless inspection must satisfy three criteria: (1) “a `substantial’ government interest [must] inform[] the regulatory scheme pursuant to which the inspection is made”; (2) the inspection “must be necessary to further [the] regulatory scheme”; and (3) “the statute’s inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application, [must] provid[e] a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.” The regulatory “statute must [also] be sufficiently comprehensive and defined” such that it “limits the discretion of inspecting officers.” “‘Where a statute authorizes the inspection but makes no rules governing the procedures that inspectors must follow, the Fourth Amendment and its various restrictive rules apply.’”
But even when the criteria set forth above are met, to satisfy the Fourth Amendment, an administrative inspection must be “appropriately limited” in both scope and execution and may not serve as a backdoor for undertaking a warrantless search unsupported by probable cause. Above all, such inspections may never circumvent the Fourth Amendment’s requirement for reasonableness. In this regard, “an administrative screening search must be as limited in its intrusiveness as is consistent with satisfaction of the administrative need that justifies it.”
As detailed earlier, the regulatory framework for barbershop inspections in Florida is embodied in Fla. Stat. § 476.184 and its implementing rules. In particular, § 476.184 requires all barbershops to have a license issued by the DBPR and directs the Florida Barbers’ Board to “adopt rules governing the operation and periodic inspection of barbershops licensed” in Florida. Rule 61G3-19.015(1), Fla. Admin. Code, in turn, provides that the DBPR may conduct inspections biennially on a “random, unannounced basis.” The regulatory framework, which sets forth who may conduct such inspections, notifies barbers that only the DBPR is so authorized. In this case, no one disputes that the DBPR possesses statutory authority to conduct warrantless inspections of barbershops, nor do the parties assert that the statute authorizing such inspections is constitutionally impermissible.
Instead, the plaintiffs contend that the search of Strictly Skillz, which they allege was undertaken with an inordinate display of force, failed to conform to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement for reasonableness. Because we have twice held, on facts disturbingly similar to those presented here, that a criminal raid executed under the guise of an administrative inspection is constitutionally unreasonable, we agree….
Unlike previous inspections of Strictly Skillz, which were all conducted by a single DBPR inspector without the aid of law enforcement, the August 21 search was executed with a tremendous and disproportionate show of force, and no evidence exists that such force was justified. Despite the fact that neither OCSO nor the DBPR had any reason to believe that the inspection of Strictly Skillz posed a threat to officer safety, the record indicates that several OCSO officers entered the barbershop wearing masks and bulletproof vests, and with guns drawn; surrounded the building and blocked all of the exits; forced all of the children and other customers to leave; announced that the business was “closed down indefinitely”; and handcuffed and conducted pat-down searches of the employees while the officers searched the premises. Such a search, which bears no resemblance to a routine inspection for barbering licenses, is certainly not reasonable in scope and execution. Rather, “[i]t is the conduct of officers conducting a raid.”
The show of force and search were all the more unreasonable in view of the fact that DBPR inspectors visited Strictly Skillz a mere two days before the search and had already determined that the barbershop and its employees were in compliance with state regulations. Thus, the subsequent sting operation at Strictly Skillz, the very purpose of which was to check for licensing violations, was gratuitous at best. Moreover, as the DBPR’s implementing rules contemplate only biennial inspections, and no violation warranting a follow-up inspection had occurred, the second inspection also exceeded the scope of the DBPR’s statutory authority….

J&K government launches portal to provide info and services of statedepartmentsPrint
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: September 22, 2014 7:12 pm
From now onwards, people need not undergo the hassle of remembering individual web sites for getting information about various departments in Jammu Kashmir as Omar Abdullah government on Monday launched the state portal so as to provide them a single window for ‘any time’ and ‘any where’ access to information and services of its various departments.
The state portal was launched in the civil secretariat here by the Minister of State for Information Technology and Science Technology (Independent charge), Feroze Khan. The official websites of various state government departments, which were accessible to citizens on different addresses shall now be accessible through this portal, an official spokesman here said.
It aims to enhance the services provided to citizens through common service centres, the spokesman said, adding that the State Portal (SP) has been developed and implemented so as to enable them access the services under a single interface mechanism in the form of the Portal.
The project entails delivery of the services through Common Service Centers (CSCs) by leveraging the common IT infrastructure. This will enable citizens to download forms and submit their applications electronically through a common gateway, he pointed out.
The minister desired to add disaster management features also to this portal as well for use at the time of the disasters for providing free flow of information relating to advisories of various departments like Public Health Engineering, Flood Control, Health, Public Distribution System etc., besides keeping the citizens informed about the rescue and relief operations. Pointing out that the non availability of the information for the trapped and rescued people in the recent flood disaster added to panic amongst the citizens, he desired that the portal be used for ensuring free flow of information in such eventuality by declaring it as a critical application.

Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: September 22, 2014 7:01 pm
At least twelve people lost their lives in different district of Meghalaya’s Garo Hills as floods and landslides played havoc following incessant rains in the past 72 hours.
While seven persons including five children were killed in South West Garo Hills district, five others died in North Garo Hills district, official sources said.
“Incessant rains in the past two days have caused serious havoc. While one person was drowned, six others were killed in landslides. Five of those killed in the landslide were children,” said Ram Singh, deputy commissioner of South West Garo Hills district over the telephone.
Five other persons were killed in landslides in Bugakol village in North Garo Hills district. Floods and landslides have affected about 1.50 lakh people in the Garo Hills region in the past two days.
The army was called out to assist the district authorities in the worst-affected North Garo hills district where at least 100 villages have been submerged. Hundreds of villagers have taken shelter in churches and school located on highlands.
Floods have also washed away several vital bridges and roads. In North Garo Hills district, the Soksan bridge that connects Mendipathar to Resubelpara was washed away. In West Garo Hills district on the other hand, the Ringgi bridge connecting the civil sub-division office in Dadenggre was washed away.
In North Garo Hills, the Soksan bridge, which connects Mendipathar to Resubelpara, was washed away. In West Garo Hills, the Ringgi bridge, which connects to civil sub-division office in Dadenggre, was washed away.
The situation turned worse in the plain areas of West Garo Hills where floods have affectd about 1.2 lakh people. The worst-hit villages are under Phulbari area wherethe Brahmaputra and its tributary Jinjiram were flowing above danger level. Embankments have been breached in several places, sources said.

IIT allows board exam marks; 20 percentile t...IIT eases norm, allows board exam marks; 20 percentile to stay

(In the case of SC/ST candidates,…)
NEW DELHI: The Indian Institutes of Technology have eased the eligibility criteria for admissions, opening their doors to students who have scored at least 75% in class XII, even if they are not among the top 20% performers of their boards, provided they crack the entrance exam. This will be in addition to the top 20-percentile criterion, adopted two years ago at the behest of then HRD minister Kapil Sibal, the IIT Council decided in its meeting in Chennai on Monday.
In other words, an aspirant, who has cracked the entrance test, should either figure in the top 20% performers of the Class XII Board examination or score at least 75%, to be eligible for admission to IITs. In the case of SC/ST candidates, the cut-off will be 70% in board examination. The change, however, will not apply retrospectively.
ET was the first to report on September 16 that IITs were considering a change to the admission criteria. The move follows criticism that the top 20-percentile criterion is shutting out many deserving candidates. Students from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are regarded as the worst hit because the top 20 percentile cut-off for their state boards usually is 90% and more. This year, about 240 students were left out despite cracking the JEE (Advance) as they did not meet the percentile criterion.

An introduction to journo-dronesBy Eugene Volokh September 22 Follow @volokhc
Small unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones, open up new possibilities for many industries, including journalism. We begin our exploration of the legal landscape of drones by looking at their uses for news gathering.
Drones are looming on the horizon these days: lurking on the border , looking for missing children and delivering beer . Public opinion on whether this is a good or bad thing varies widely. The legal issues surrounding our drone future are similarly unsettled. Thanks to the hospitality of the Volokh Conspiracy , we’ll be exploring the legal and policy dimensions of domestic drone use all week, with a special focus on the use of drones for journalistic purposes — we are media lawyers , after all!
Drones for journalistic use — journo-drones, as we’ll call them — have been on the scene since at least 2011, when the Daily, News Corp.’s now-defunct tablet newspaper, flew camera-equipped drones to survey the devastation wrought by tornadoes in Alabama .(The Federal Aviation Administration was not impressed .)
Since then, journo-drones have demonstrated their capabilities as one of the newest tools of the journalist trade. For example, in 2012 a hobbyist flying his drone over the Trinity River in Texas noticed a nearby creek with red rivulets, which, upon closer inspection, were streams of pig blood flowing from a local slaughterhouse. The footage prompted a lengthy investigation. Likewise, in 2013, while Colorado was in the midst of horrific rains and flooding, a private company used drones to map the floods in an effort to educate the public. And in Australia, one media company used a drone to observe refugee encampments on Christmas Island after being denied permission to view the area.
Journalists are eager to use drones in their reporting for many reasons. Here are a few:
Vantage point. First, and most obviously, drones have the ability to capture incredible images, offering vantage points that previously could only be accessed at great expense. Unlike aerial footage from news helicopters, drones offer viewpoints that previously were unimaginable. The Daily’s footage of tornado damage illustrates this advantage: Although on-the-ground reporting might have given a close-up of the outside of destroyed buildings, and helicopter imagery could have displayed the destroyed horizon, the Daily’s news drones were able to switch between those vantage points, offering people perspectives that otherwise could never have been seen. Indeed, many of the places the drone surveyed were not accessible to people, at least not safely. In addition to their visual capabilities, drones can be equipped with an array of sensors to gather data about weather, temperature and radiation, as well as other environmental information.
Drones — better known in the technology industry and among regulators as small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) — come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some look like model airplanes, while others look nothing like the manned aircraft we have seen in the past, taking the form of futuristic mini-spaceships with multiple rotors. From what we’ve seen, most journalists are interested in drones that span less than a few feet in diameter and weigh only a few pounds. The advantage of such drones over helicopters is clear: Their small size permits accessibility to otherwise hard-to-reach areas, allowing versatility in vantage points that range seamlessly from up above to up close, into tight spots and in between obstacles.
Cost. Today, a small Parrot AR drone, which can fly a few hundred feet in the air for about 15 minutes, costs only $300 . The cost of a more sophisticated drone can range from roughly $1,000 to $40,000, depending on its size, the distance it can travel and the time it can stay in the air. By way of comparison, operating a helicopter for news coverage costs approximately $1,000 per hour , including the cost of the personnel required to fly it.
Safety. Unmanned drones can eradicate the need for placing humans in harm’s way when reporting on natural disasters and other dangerous events, making on-the-scene reporting possible as never before. For example, drones can easily fly over forest fires , through the aftermath of a typhoon and even into erupting volcanoes , all without risking human life.
As a result,the demand for drones is growing exponentially. The technology is developing just as rapidly, building on drones’ advantages and minimizing their risks.
The law has not kept pace, lurching forward in fits and starts. Federal regulators have not moved quickly enough to accommodate this nascent industry or to safely integrate drones into American airspace. Though drone enthusiasts, including the media, want the FAA to issue regulations to provide some clear and comprehensive guidance, that has yet to happen.
We will spend the next week wading through a number of issues related to domestic drone use. Given our backgrounds and interest in journo-drones, we will focus primarily on private drone use, leaving for others the questions and debates triggered by drones used by government agencies and law enforcement officials. In our subsequent posts, we will:
(1) Outline some of the potential legal issues raised by drones;
(2) Take a look at the various approaches that policymakers might pursue in regulating drones;
(3) Provide a broad overview of the regulatory history and current regulatory landscape governing drones;
(4) Describe the laws some states have passed governing the private use of drones;
(5) Discuss laws of general applicability that serve to regulate private drone use; and
(6) Offer our thoughts on the laws states have passed thus far regulating private drone use and where we should go from here.
Stay tuned! We look forward to sharing our insights and reading your comments and questions.

Alaska reporter quits on live TV after a segment about the medical marijuana club she runsBy Abby Ohlheiser September 22 Follow @abbyohlheiser
Charlo Green quit her TV job rather abruptly during a nightly newscast. (KTVA/YouTube)
Viewers of KTVA's Sunday night newscast learned all about the Alaska Cannabis Club, a medical marijuana group. And then, they learned something else: The reporter who presented the story to the station's viewers is also the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club.
Charlo Greene then quit her TV job on live television after promising to dedicate "all of my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska."
She added: "And as for this job, well, not that I have a choice, but, [expletive] it, I quit."
You can watch the full video, which contains Greene's explicit sign-off, here .
Although Greene told Alaska Dispatch News that her (former) employers had no idea she was going to quit on air, or that she ran the club she reported on, the Alaska Cannibis Club's Facebook page encouraged its followers to tune in for the Sunday broadcast.
"I wanted to draw attention to this issue. And the issue is medical marijuana," Greene told the Dispatch News after the broadcast. "If I offended anyone, I apologize. But I’m not sorry for the choice that I made."
Although it seems a bit redundant to fire an employee who already quit, KTVA, a CBS affiliate, wanted to make it crystal clear that it did not condone Greene's unexpected remarks on Sunday. Especially the swearing.
Viewers, we sincerely apologize for the inappropriate language used by a KTVA reporter on the air tonight. The employee has been terminated.
— KTVA 11 News (@ktva) September 22, 2014
As NBC-affiliated KTUU noted , Sunday's broadcast wasn't the first time Greene had reported on cannabis for the station, apparently even after the Alaska Cannibis Club's founding earlier this year.
In at least one earlier segment, Greene did not disclose her connection to the group:
KTUU reported that Greene's legal name is Charlene Egbe, which is listed as the name of the Alaska Cannabis Club's owner in the state's corporation records database. The group was founded on April 20.
RELATED: Want to dramatically quit your job? Here are some of the best on-air resignations .
Although search results point to a five-part KTVA series on cannabis that aired on the station starting on April 29, those pages are no longer available on the station's Web site. A cached, text-only version of the URLs still show the pieces, authored by Charlo Greene; some of the segments, like the one above, are still available on YouTube.
Alaska allows for legal, medical marijuana use, thanks to a 1998 ballot measure . Under the measure , patients suffering from cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, MS and other ailments are able to obtain approval to possess, use and grow small amounts of the substance as part of their treatment, with a doctor's certification.
But cannabis advocates in the state -- including Greene's club -- argue that the laws are too vague to safely and legally allow patients to access the substance, even with that approval. Under the current law, cardholders may possess a small amount of marijuana and grow a small number of plants for personal use or for other cardholders in the state.
That's where it gets trickier, advocates argue, because the law is quiet on how cardholders can actually buy what they need to grow the plant or otherwise obtain marijuana for medical use if they're unable to grow it themselves. In other words, a cardholder can grow marijuana for his or her own use (and give away the plant to other approved cardholders), but it's still not really legal to sell marijuana in Alaska.
Greene's club was the subject of an August Alaska Dispatch News story , which noted that the club's founder spoke to the paper "on the condition of anonymity, citing concern over potential repercussions from her employer." In the story, the founder (presumably Greene) explained how her club has set up something of a stop-gap, work-around to help get patients access to cannabis.
Instead of buying marijuana from a grower, club members agree to give "donations" covering the cost of growing the substance to the person growing the plants. Patient and supplier are then paired up, and the club steps out of the picture. Understandably, the Dispatch referred to this system as operating within a "legal gray area" in the state. Which is why Greene's club is trying to change Alaska's laws.
The state will vote on another marijuana measure in November:  Ballot Measure 2 asks voters to approve a proposal that would "allow a person to possess, use, show, buy, transport, or grow set amounts of marijuana, with the growing subject to certain restrictions." If approved, the measure would implement a similar regulation process for marijuana to the one currently in place for the use and sale of alcohol.
Greene has set up an IndieGoGo page to collect donations for her group's marijuana advocacy work. Although she is clearly hoping that her high-profile resignation will draw positive attention to her campaign to support a measure that she believes will clarify and improve state laws on cannabis use, the measure's opponents see something else in the broadcast:
@VoteNo2AK i am very offended and want her jailed. she was most likely high on marijuana that's why she had such a psychotic outbreak.
Washington and Colorado both have recreational marijuana laws on the books; in addition to Alaska, voters in the District of Columbia and Oregon will consider a recreational marijuana proposal in November.

Goa Governor to welcome guests with basket of fruits instead of flowersUpdated: September 23, 2014 03:23 IST
Goa Governor to welcome guests with basket of fruits instead of flowers
Prakash Kamat
Tweet
Governor of Goa, Mridula Sinha has expressed her desire that she would like to welcome dignitaries to the state with a single flower and a basket of fruits and she would also prefer to be welcomed in the same manner.
She has appealed to the public representatives and dignitaries of Goa that they may encourage the same practice which will boost the sale of locally grown fruits and also feed the needy children at various institutions.
Ms. Sinha made a beginning of her innovative idea by welcoming Vice President Dr. M. Hamid Ansari and his wife Salma Ansari at Dabolim airport in south Goa on Sunday with a basket of fruits instead of bouquet of flowers, which was a pleasant surprise for the dignitaries present at the airport.
The Vice President and Ms. Ansari lauded the gesture, said sources in Raj Bhavan. The fruits were later given to orphanage and childcare centers for the needy children. Vice President and his wife stayed at Raj Bhavan during their visit.
Ms. Sinha mentioned that she was inspired by Chief Minister of Gujarat Anandi Ben Patel, when she expressed a desire to be welcomed with basket of fruits instead of flowers.
The Governor hosted a dinner in their honour at Raj Bhavan on Sunday, which was also attended by Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, Dy. Chief Minister Francisco D’Souza, Speaker Rajendra Arlekar, among others.

Mumbai: Navratri security to get extra muscle  women bouncers on prowlThis Navratri, several high-profile mandals in Mumbai have, for the first time, sought the services of women bouncers to calm out-of-control revelers. Diplomatic finesse and a stern demeanour works more effectively than sheer brawn, say organisers.

Ghatkopar Gujarati Samaj, which is holding a Navratri Mahotsav at Police Chowky Ground in Ghatkopar, has hired 12 women bouncers. This is in addition to the usual 50-odd men security guards that the popular event, which is expecting around 1,000 participants daily during the nine-day revelry, hires.
Jitendra Mehta, the group’s president, said the move would make the women participants more at ease. “Men are always ready to come to blows. Women, we hope, will be more calm and better adept at mollifying tricky situations,” Mehta said.
This does not mean that the softer bouncers plan to go easy on the unruly crowds. Pooja Kothkar, who is in her 30's and is part of the 12-women security team, said she could be a toughie if the situation arose. “We always take the troublesome person in the side and reason. But we can throw someone out if needed,” said Kothkar, who said she was an athlete before joining security agencies.   
Umesh Lokhande, the area officer of Andheri-based Industrial Security Consultant Power Limited, the agency providing the security cover to the Samaj, said the demand of women bouncers was on a rise in general, even as it was providing the service to a Navratri celebration for the first time in its 15-year history. The price that each woman bouncer commands, said Lokhande, was around Rs. 1,500 per evening.
Gurmeet Singh Shera, the owner of Tiger Security which is providing the cover at Goregaon Sports Club where singer Falguni Pathak is set to perform, said that 10 women bouncers will man the nine-day event along with 40 male guards. “For the first time, we also received queries from Navratri mandals in Gujarat, and we are extending this service to three celebrations there. This is besides other queries from Mumbai events,” said Shera.
The move has gone down well with the city police too. DCP Dhananjay Kulkarni, spokesperson for Mumbai police, who says he too had appealed the organisers to beef up security by women guards, including women bouncers, said, “Women are better equipped to deal with issues of women. Participants will find it easier to approach a touch woman guard than a man in case of a problem,” he said.

Mars Mission: Isro successfully test-fires Mangalyaan engineSet for date with Mars, Mangalyaan in 'good health'
Vanita Srivastava , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 22, 2014
First Published: 15:50 IST(22/9/2014) | Last Updated: 05:26 IST(24/9/2014)
Indian scientists on Monday successfully tested the main engine of the country’s Mars mission spacecraft and completed a course correction that put the probe on track to enter the red planet’s orbit on September 24.
 
If successful, India will become the first country to make it to Mars in its maiden attempt, propelling it to an elite club of space race leaders. Only the US, Europe and Russia have so far sent probes that have successfully orbited or landed on the planet.
“We had a perfect burn for four seconds as programmed. The trajectory has been corrected. MOM (Mars Orbiter Mission) will now go for the nominal plan for Mars Orbit Insertion,” the Indian Space Research Organisation’s Facebook page said.
 
The liquid engine, which was dormant for 300 days, will be used with eight small thrusters during orbit entry by the spacecraft in India’s first interplanetary mission.
 
“The spacecraft is in good health. Mission controllers are going through the final round of the sequence of operations,” ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan told HT, adding that there was a lot more to do.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be at Isro’s command centre in Bengaluru at 7.30am on September 24 to witness the mission’s last phase after the probe broke into Mars’ sphere of influence on Monday.

The Mangalyaan, as the spacecraft is popularly known, aims to study Mars' surface and mineral composition, and search its atmosphere for methane, a chemical strongly tied to life on earth.
Video: Mangalyaan’s real test on Sept 24: Former scientist Biman Basu?
India’s Rs. 450-crore expedition cost about a tenth of Nasa’s Mars mission Maven that entered the red planet’s orbit on Wednesday. Modi hailed the project’s low price tag in June, saying it was less than the budget of the Hollywood space movie Gravity.
 
“I hope India will consider international participation in any future missions to Mars as this mission will clearly demonstrate its capability to successfully deliver a payload to Mars and many countries would be pleased to collaborate with India,” said Mark Sims, professor of astrobiology and space instrumentation at the UK’s University of Leicester.
 
The 680-million-kilometre journey to Mars that began on November 5 last year has had its share of adventures and feats —five orbit-raising manoeuvres including a small glitch in the fourth such operation that was fixed.
 
Probes to Mars have a high failure rate and a success will boost India’s space exploration programme, especially after a similar mission by China failed to leave earth’s orbit in 2011.

Rupee falls after four days to 60.82 levelForex update: Rupee falls after four days to 60.82 level
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: September 22, 2014  | 20:33 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The rupee on Monday closed one paisa down at 60.82 against the US dollar at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market on alternate bouts of demand and supply, snapping a four-day rising trend.
In lacklustre trade, the rupee commenced lower at 60.85 against the American unit from its previous close of 60.81 . It was trapped in a range of 60.7425 and 60.88 before concluding at 60.82, showing a minor fall of one paisa.
In the previous four days, the domestic unit had risen by 32 paise.
The dollar index was down 0.04 per cent against its major global rivals.

Uma Bharti chalks out plan for Ganga rejuvenation; monitors Guj govt work on SabarmatiriverBharti was on her one-day visit to Gujarat primarily to observe the work done by Gujarat Government to preserve and develop Sabarmati river which could be replicated in the Ganga Rejuvenation project.
Express News Service | Gandhinagar | Posted: September 22, 2014 8:17 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 8:31 pm
Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Uma Bharti  has formed a committee to find out the path of dried up Saraswati river near Siddhpur in Patan district which may help increase ground water level in the region. Bharti said so while talking to media persons on her one-day visit to Gujarat on Monday primarily to observe the work done by Gujarat Government to preserve and develop Sabarmati river which could be replicated in the Ganga Rejuvenation project.
Bharti said that Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had done a lot of work on this (finding path of the dried-up Saraswati river) and added that her ministry had formed a committee which included Gujarat-cadre IAS officer posted with the ministry as additional secretary, Amarjeet Singh, for the task.
She also stated that the committee would make efforts to find out the path of dried-up rivers in the country. She said that this would not necessarily mean effort to recharge the river, but it would certainly help in efforts to increase overall ground water level in the region. She added that it was yet not known if the river could be recharged.
Explaining the primary object of her visit Bharti said, “I have come to see the work done by Gujarat Government on the Sabarmati river. Former Chief Minister of Gujarat who is now the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has given me a very important task of rejuvenating Ganga-Yamuna and sister rivers. A lot of work has been done in Gujarat (on water resources) and so, I am going to visit Sabarmati river. Our department will study the work (done by Gujarat Government there)…”
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done good work in all the subjects in Gujarat. And in the field of water resources, massive work has been done in Gujarat,” she added.
In the morning, Bharti had visited Siddhpur to offer prayers on Matru Shraddha. “Today is a very auspicious day, its Krishna Chaturdashi. And so, I had gone there (Siddhpur) for Matru Shraddha.”
Later in the day, Bharti had paid a courtesy visit to Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel during which she also talked on the work done by Gujarat Government on Sabarmati river.
Sabarmati Riverfront recently came into lime-light when Chinese President, Xi Jinping, and a huge Chinese delegation accompanied by him was hosted by Modi there near Subhash Bridge in Ahmedabad.
After meeting Patel at Swarnim Sankul in New Secretariat in Gandhinagar in the afternoon, Bharti spoke to media persons wherein she refused to comment on the political imbroglio between BJP and Shivsena in Maharashtra on seat sharing continued…

Employees with work friends are more committed to companies  study showsEmployees with work friends more committed to companies, study shows

Study: Employees tend to trust their co-workers more than company leadership
Study: 73 percent of employees have laughed until they (almost) cried with co-workers at work
Employees with work friends are twice as likely to trust company leadership, study shows
A recent national study of worker relationships says work friends matter more than ever and companies should care more about fostering those connections.  
Most full-time employees spend more time with co-workers than their families, the study of 716 randomly sampled workers at companies with at least 500 employees found. The fall edition of the Globoforce Workforce Mood Tracker survey, which is conducted twice a year, was administered in August.
“There is … a strong argument in this data for companies to be more thoughtful about the cultures they are creating,” the report said, “and to actively promote the development of work friendships and emotional connections among employees.”
A few highlights on co-worker relationships:

Apple's iPhone 6 Plus uses chips from Qualcomm, Skyworks Solutions, Avago Technologies and other companies, according to gadget repair firm iFixit, which pried one of the devices open in Melbourne early on Friday.
Apple said it received a record 4 million first-day pre-orders for the new phones, double the number for the iPhone 5 two years ago, underscoring investors' expectations the new handset will maintain the Silicon Valley company's stellar growth.

Like previous iPhones, the iPhone 6 Plus uses a Qualcomm 4G LTE modem, according to iFixit.
Dissembling the device in a Mac repair shop after lining up overnight to buy a phone, iFixit technicians also discovered a Murata wifi module, a Broadcom touchscreen controller, and chips from Skyworks, Avago and TriQuint .

Seven remarkable A-list advertsElliott Gould’s drive time
Judging by reactions to the Lincoln Motor Company’s new advertising campaign, viewers – in amazement and perhaps stupefaction – blinked before either beefcake did.
Paying celebrities to sell cars is a perilous business. In theory, the pitch person amplifies the manufacturer’s message, while in practice, the advert may condense The Odd Couple down to 30 awkward seconds. Sometimes, however, a pairing taps a nerve, resonating beyond the wildest projections of even the most bullish agency executive.
Here are some of the most curious and courageous link-ups in car-advert history.
Kylie Minogue / Ford (2002)
In her long-awaited global breakthrough year, the Australian pop singer capitalised on her newfound ubiquity with… an advert for the most affordable car in Ford’s global portfolio. Minogue’s spot for the Street Ka, set in a northern Italian town, is not subtle in its messaging, but who needs subtlety when the biggest pop star in the world is driving your budget convertible?
Ricardo Montalbán / Chrysler (1975-80)
The suave, crisply tailored star was at the height of his popularity when Chrysler contracted him to pitch its Cordoba luxury two-door sedan. The Mexican actor pronounced the coupe’s name Cor-DO-bah rather than the proper COR-do-bah, and a “lean-burn engine” may have sounded as thrilling as lettuce to consumers squeezed by the 1970s oil crisis, but the mere richness and measured cadence of Montalbán’s voice sold the vehicle. Chrysler would turn to Montalbán again in the late ‘80s for its New Yorker sedan campaign, but it is the Cordoba – and its “Corinthian leather” – with which the actor is forever linked.
Tiger Woods / Buick (2001)
Already one of history’s most dominant golfers at age 24, Woods could have endorsed towel lint in 2001 and been called a visionary. But a supremely athletic 24-year-old behind the wheel of a Buick – long the territory of retirees who might otherwise practice their putter – created perhaps the most dissonant piece of car advertising of the new millennium. When Woods’ romantic life became headline news in 2009, nobody was surprised to learn that his damaged SUV was not a Rendezvous .
Jean Claude Van Damme / Volvo Trucks (2013)
The pieces did not add up. A Belgian action star in his third act; a Swedish trucking company; an Enya soundtrack; a Spanish sunset. Working in concert, however, they created the most popular automotive video uploaded to YouTube in 2013 – or in any other year.
Tina Turner / Plymouth (1988)
Until its dissolution in 2001, Plymouth was positioned as the value brand in the Chrysler firmament. It contracted Tina Turner to convey that approachability for its 1989 Acclaim sedan. A close relation to the roundly reviled K-cars (the name stemmed from the internal designation for models built on Chrysler’s K platform), the Acclaim held little in common with its vivacious spokeswoman other than its name.
Matthew McConaughey / Lincoln Motor (2014)
Since 2012, Ford’s luxury subsidiary has been treated to a new design studio, a brand re-launch and three new models , all part of a $2bn investment by its parent. Lincoln’s loudest move, however, may be in making US actor Matthew McConaughey (in his Oscar-winning year, no less) its television pitchman. Helmed by director Nicolas Winding Refn, the TV spots make arch reference to the values of the Lincoln brand, as McConaughey distills his recent oeuvre into a composite portrayal of himself. It was not surprising, then, when US television presenter Conan O’Brien lampooned the ads, weaving choice bits of dialogue from the actor’s back catalogue into a late-night super-cut .
Eminem / Chrysler (2011)
Surfacing from bankruptcy with new corporate ownership (Fiat Group) and a shrewd marketing chief (Olivier François), Chrysler did what brash players do at the Super Bowl: it flexed for the camera. Over two minutes, the US carmaker called out its critics, reinforced Detroit’s “Motor City” sobriquet and made Chrysler’s 2011-model-year 200 sedan – a warmed-over version of the moribund Sebring – appear desirable. All this, before Eminem even entered frame. The rapper’s parting shot, “This is what we do,” was both rebuke and rally cry for a company – and a city – returning to its feet.

Pabst Blue Ribbon is Being Sold to the Russians  Was So Over AnywayDiselDemon / Flickr
Pabst Blue Ribbon, the cheap-but-tolerable beer that will forever be identified with early 2000s American hipsterdom, is being bought by Russian investors. According to the New York Times, Oasis Beverages will pay more than $700 million to acquire the Pabst Brewing Co., which also makes Colt 45 and Old Milwaukee. The sale will net a tidy profit for Dean Metropoulos, the businessman who bought Pabst for a mere $250 million in 2010.  
After a quarter century of declining sales, Pabst came back from the dead during the early aughts because it was a dirt-cheap beer with a kitschy, blue-collar appeal that tickled the cool kids in places like Portland and Williamsburg . It also had an absolutely unbeatable endorsement from Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet , that, due to Slate's profanity policy, I won't reproduce here. But unlike style statements such as trucker hats and handlebar mustaches, its popularity managed to sustain and grow through the decade, even as sales of pale American lagers like Bud Light and Miller Light flat-lined . In a relatively short period of time it has become a mainstream bargain brew with a global market.

But last year, something funny happened. According to Euromonitor, U.S. sales of Pabst by liter basically stopped rising in 2013, even as they continued their upward march globally. Granted, it was just one off year. But it seems entirely possible that Pabst's future will hinge on drinkers abroad. It certainly wouldn't be the first beer to try and sell an all-American image overseas even as U.S. drinkers lose interest.

"Pabst Blue Ribbon is the quintessential American brand—it represents individualism, egalitarianism and freedom of expression—all things that make this country great," Eugene Kashper, the chairman of Oasis Beverages, said in a statement after the sale was announced. Most Americans probably stopped buying that a while ago. But maybe Russians haven't.

A Guide to Getting the Most of Going to Conferencesreddit
You signed up to go to the conference. Great! Now you can just figure out what to pack, look over the schedule, pick your sessions and breakouts and go. That is one way to go to a conference and it might be fulfilling for you, but when you start to go to a lot of conferences you begin to wonder if you really are getting anything out of them. Stop wondering and start setting goals and making a real plan.
Tips to Better Conferencing
Before the Conference: Figure out your goal for attending.
Is it to meet people in your community?
Do you want to make an important contact that you know will be there (another attendee, a vendor, a speaker, the organizer, or someone else)
Do you want to find new information to accelerate your growth? Trends, tools, tips, and new ideas.
Are you trying to find potential partners for your work?
Do you need to find customers or a job?
Do you just need a weekend to chill out and a conference seems like as good a place as anywhere else.
Don't Wander the Conference: Have a plan before the conference -- what sessions, events and breakouts that you plan on attending.
Look at the schedule before hand and plot out your plan.
Build in time to socialize.
Build in time to rest -- taking in a ton of information all day and playing all night can be a bit hard for most folks. Have a plan on taking some downtime too.
If you are going with a buddy, split up the sessions and have a debrief after the conference to share what you both learned.
Be Ready with Your Info: Have cards ready.
It's ok if you are an introvert, but you have to have a way to leave an impression for folks. That can be as simple as a business card or as complex as a leave behind. If they can't connect with you after the event, well, they won't.
Take Care of You: Conference food trials and tribulations
Conference food isn't always great or even if it is good it just isn't what you are used to eating. If you need a healthy selection of real food you might want to bring it. Stock yourself with whatever you need because more often than not there will be plenty of carbs and the odd green apple, but not a lot of choice.
Swag Crap: What to drag home and what not to take.
Conferences have really become the place to grab tons of gifts and goodies. Here's the thing though, you don't, probably, need any of it. Leave it. Really. Unless it is something you really love you don't want to have to pay more to ship it or try to stuff it into your already crowded bag.
Follow-Up: None of this matters if you don't take the time to follow-up.
You made new friends and met new potential partners. Take the next week and follow-up with them. Connect with them on social media platforms. Then send an actual email -- remind them where they met you and what you talked about. This is WHY you came or at least the very best perk of attending. Don't blow it. Follow up!
Review and Maybe Repeat: Time to think about next year.
Don't leave it up to memory. Take a moment to reflect on the goals you made for the conference and decide if it is something that you want to repeat next year. If you really didn't get something awesome from it, or at least a little awesome, maybe your time and money would be better spent in another way.
Have a great conference tip? Leave it in the comments. Let's make these events the very best we can for ourselves, our companies (if they are sending us) and for those we meet and follow-up with.  Conferences cost a lot of money and time; it is time that you got the most out of them.

Women in Business: Q&A with Venus Hurst  Founder of Doll Face Brandreddit
Venus Hurst is no stranger to entrepreneurship. In 2001, she created Venus Staffing, an agency specializing in promotional and event model staffing. More recently, Hurst has focused on her latest endeavor: Doll Face Brand , a cosmetic line consisting of hand and foot exfoliator kits and quick drying, long lasting, trend-driven nail polish.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?
What inspired me to start Doll Face Brand is my passion for fashion, beauty and glamour and to inspire and empower women. I wanted to create a line of cosmetics that was fun and flirty, while still speaking to the female market in Detroit. It is a one stop shop where ladies can get nail polish or even moisturizers or a t shirt and it makes being a mom easier so she doesn't have to shop around so much. Well I started staffing in 2001 I started Doll Face Brand in 2011. I had a vision to launch Doll Face about 10 yrs ago.
How has your previous employment experience aided your position at Doll Face Brand?
I operate two businesses by balancing my time and my first business helped me with time management and managing staff. Since Venus Staffing is already established I spend more time on that but lately Venus Staffing has been slow since every business has it's ups and downs and I have been able to spend lots of hours promoting and growing Doll Face Brand! I am very passionate about both so I am able to pursue both of them full time.
What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at Doll Face Brand?
We just attended the 2014 Magic Show in Las Vegas, I also attend local events, and parties around the city of Detroit to promote Doll Face brand, social media, online marketing, going to local stores small and large to tell them about Doll Face Brand and hiring a great PR firm. Getting your name out there in magazines newspapers tv and radio as well as online bloggers is great way to promote a brand and blink pr is doing that for us!
How do you maintain a work/life balance?
I turn off my phone at a certain hour and spend time with my kids and I work hard during office hours but make sure to spend quality time with the family too.
What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?
The biggest issue for women in the workplace is learning how to market their own companies especially with social media on the rise -- it's an unknown space that women can take advantage of and use for their benefit.
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?
Mentorship has inspired me to be a natural leader, a great mother and influence to my family. I have also learned to work as a team with my staff and learned valuable management skills in being a female entrepreneur.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why?
Folorunsho Alakija-she's the richest women in the world she owns an oil company and from Nigeria Africa. I admire her ambition! She went to school for fashion design and she also promotes a foundation that helped widows, orphans by empowering them through scholarships and grants.
Sara Blakely...she is the creater of Spanx her invention in power women. Last is Doreen McCarther owner of Rehema Health Care she is a humanitarian an goes above and behind for others and her patients.
What do you want Doll Face Brand to accomplish in the next year?
My goal for Doll Face Brand is to become a Household name world wide and to inspire and empower women. I would like all women to hear the name and know the brand and for customers to be very satisfied with the products and the new releases.

How to Pick a Lifestyle Consistent with Your Passionreddit
Too many people, young and older, let their career and their lifestyle happen to them, rather than proactively making things happen based on their personal passions, skills, and interests. Others make decisions based on someone else's interests, such as the father who wants his son to take over the family business, or dreams openly of having a doctor in the family. Neither of these approaches is likely to lead to a satisfying career or personal happiness for you.
These days, with the instant access to information and experts in every field around the world, and the wealth of personal assessment tools available on the Internet, there is no excuse for not exploring and evaluating the alternatives before you make a step forward. I just finished reading another recently updated resource " Promote Yourself. The New Rules For Career Success " by Dan Schawbel, managing partner of Millennial Branding, a Gen Y research and consulting firm.
Among other things, he outlines some of the popular assessment tools that I also often recommend as a mentor to entrepreneurs, including the following:
MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) . Myers Briggs is one of the most widely used and recognized career assessments in existence, and does an excellent job of identifying your personality type so you can connect it to the right career and lifestyle. It can also help you better relate to others and become more self-aware.
Gallup's Clifton Strength Finder . The focus of this tool is to help you discover your top five strengths and learn how you can use them to excel and perform at a higher level. The creator, Dr. Donald O. Clifton, is widely recognized as the Father of Strengths-Based Psychology, and has helped millions of people around the world discover their strengths.
Marcus Buckingham StandOut Assessment . This one builds on the positive premise that the most effective method for improving people is to build on their strengths, rather than correcting their weaknesses. It's the one to use if you have tried other assessments that claim to tell you who you are, but don't tell you what you can do with that information.
Career Key . This one helps you identify careers and even college majors that match your set of interests, traits, skills, and abilities. It was developed by Lawrence K. Jones, a professor Emeritus in the College of Education at North Carolina State University, who specializes in the areas of school counseling and career counseling and development.
MAPP™ Career Assessment . The MAPP career assessment is perfect for students, graduates and working adults. You'll get a wealth of information to help find the right career that matches your unique assessment profile. The MAPP career test was one of the first comprehensive career tests online for consumers, with over 7 million customers.
Leadership Motivation Assessment . This one tells you how motivated you are to be a leader. After all, it takes hard work to become an effective business leader; and if you are not prepared to put this work in, or if, deep down, you're not sure whether you want to lead or not, you'll struggle to lead people effectively, and not be happy doing it as well.
If after taking one or more of these, you are still stuck on what domain you fit best into, whether you should be an entrepreneur, and how to get started, the following questions should help get those introspective juices flowing into action:
When have you been the most committed and passionate toward something in your life?
What talents do you use the most and what are your strengths?
Which roles and activities did you like and dislike in the past?
What aspect of those roles did you like the most and least?
After you get your own thoughts and assessment results together, it helps to get some feedback from people you respect, including parents, industry experts, and mentors. An outside perspective can be incredibly valuable as well, and help you narrow down what may seem like a long list, and relate that to the real world. Something you feel passionate about that doesn't put food on the table, for example, may not be sustainable.
But the time to start is now. The most important point is to plot your own path, rather than be a victim of unpredictable circumstances and someone else's whims. Don't let other people be winners at your expense.

Reinvent Your Business Model or Diereddit
'Change almost never fails because it's too early. It almost always fails because it's too late.' - Seth Godin
One of the key components of transformation and innovation is the business model, and since the ability of companies to transform and reinvent themselves is crucial to their lifeline, I went straight to the source, the global expert on business models and author of the international bestseller , Business Model Generation , Dr. Alexander Osterwalder .
Dr. Alexander Osterwalder (Twitter: @AlexOsterwalder )
Large companies today don't always understand their current business model very well, let alone be thinking of what the next one will be, yet according to Osterwalder it is the ability to both execute on the current business model while thinking of the business model of tomorrow that will ultimately be the difference between a company that is a one hit wonder and one that is here to stay. To address the fact that very few companies are able to do both at the same time without a tool to help them, Osterwalder invented the " Business Model Canvas ," a strategic management tool to design, test, build and manage business models.
How to develop a business model for today and tomorrow:
1. All master craftsman have the right tools - On Twitter ( @alexosterwalder ), Dr. Osterwalder says that he won't rest until senior executives and entrepreneurs operate as surgeons. He tells us to think of having to go through heart surgery and here comes your surgeon with one tool in his hands - and it's a Swiss army knife.  Scary thought.  Just as a surgeon needs a variety of tools to perform specific operations, company executives need business tools that are practical and go beyond SWOT analysis. This idea was the inspiration for his book and company, Strategyzer . At the heart of the book, Business Model Generation, is a tool called the Business Model Canvas, which allows companies to visualize their business model using 9 building blocks to develop a one-page blueprint of their strategy and tell the story of how they are creating, storing and delivering value.
There's a reason why in the competitive business book market (where 250,000 books exist already and another 11,000 come out each year) why one million copies of Business Model Generation have already been sold. Osterwalder attributes the success of the book to fact that it differentiates itself from the others by being very visual and helping to simplify a complex thing like business models. "The Business Model Canvas enables companies to get out of the world of blah, blah, blah and into the world where strategic conversations are mapped to something more tangible and concrete," says Osterwalder.
2. Design, search, iterate and rinse and repeat - The Business Model Canvas is very simple, yet the implications of the Canvas are deep.  In fact, it's the foundation of a Stanford University course taught by Steve Blank , seasoned entrepreneur and Harvard recognized "Master of Innovation".  "In the next meeting where you have to talk about the business model or strategy, get everyone around a canvas to sketch it out," recommends Osterwalder. "You may think that everyone is on same page, but that is not always the case."
The goal is to be able to sketch out a Business Model Canvas and throw it away in the next minute. Sketch it and test it immediately by getting out of the building and talking to customers to determine if the pains you think your customer has are really there. If they are not, it's back to the drawing board - an iterative process that Osterwalder calls design and search, where you prototype a Business Model Canvas and throw it away until you have actual evidence that it is going to work.  The Business Model Canvas is the tool that is shaping the idea, and the search is giving the evidence that it is going to work.
An iteration process is an important element of business model design. With an initial idea there is a larger degree of uncertainty, which is why Osterwalder recommends doing cheap tests, such as talking to customers or giving customers a link to go to for more information and then tracking if they actually clicked through, that allow companies to learn.  As uncertainty is gradually reduced, companies can increase spending on experiments until they have enough evidence.  The more they know, the more they can invest.  The next step is to turn the evidence from the market into execution; this is where companies can switch from the search mode into execution mode where they can scale the idea.
3. Business plans are a waste of time; execute today while inventing for tomorrow - If you are a large company, the Business Model Canvas can help you to better execute on your existing business while at the same time allowing you to create a playground to think about the business models of tomorrow - essential for reinventing your company in the face of constant disruption.  Osterwalder says that a lot of successful companies today are applying their logic from their existing business plan onto the business models of tomorrow, but because you don't know what's going to work, the answer cannot be found within their four walls. So are business plans a waste of time? Osterwalder and Chuck Blakeman, founder and owner of The Crankest Group think so. Steve Blank's view on business plans is that they do not serve a useful purpose, and he, like Osterwalder, proposes a business model instead.
"Tools like the Business Model Canvas help to leverage a process that companies are already doing but in a better way," explains Osterwalder who says it is more important today to have such a tool because companies need to change their business models more frequently and having a tool can take the pain out of the process. People are struggling with the fact that their old business models are expiring.  If you compare Kodak and Fugi, two companies whose core business was disrupted by digital, Kodak went bankrupt because they were incapable of reinventing themselves, while Fugi succeeded because they were able to successfully reinvent themselves.
4. Hire a Chief Corporate Entrepreneur - CEOs apply the principles of execution to the search of new business models, which according to Osterwalder, does not work because they don't test the business models and the business plan. Today in large companies, Osterwalder is calling for a second job title that operates at the same level and in close partnership with the CEO (Chief Execution Officer). The new title that Osterwalder is proposing, the Chief Corporate Entrepreneur , would be tasked with inventing the future of the company, whereas the CEO is tasked with running the existing business that is financing the future.  The idea behind the new role is that companies run by entrepreneurs are able to reinvent themselves. Osterwalder points to Apple, a company that demonstrates proactive reinvention by introducing new products that make existing ones obsolete (iPhone disrupts the iPod, etc.).  In addition, he says that the number of business models that Amazon is running today is spectacular and they are able to build on the business models that are already running while diversifying.
5. Articulate your customer value proposition - The Business Model Canvas allows companies to describe how they are creating value for their company.  In his new book, Value Proposition Design , Osterwalder provides a new tool for companies to describe how they are creating value for their customer.  The tool allows companies to visualize in a concrete way how products and services are creating value for their customers, something which many companies are currently unable to articulate. The tool zooms into two boxes on the Business Model Canvas, the value proposition and the customer segment being targeted, and provides a visual map to describe how products and services are creating value for customers. It allows companies to connect products and services to the pain relievers and gain creators of customers , and provides them with a shared language to make strategic things more tangible and to be explicit about how they are creating value for customers.
Value Proposition Design will be available for purchase on October 20th, but you can get a sneak peek of 100 pages for free on Osterwalder's website .
6. Make the business model everyone's responsibility - Everyone in the company is responsible for the business model and the value proposition says Osterwalder, who paints a future where these kinds of tools will replace the current broken strategic planning process and offer a social system and living tool that everyone will understand, have visibility into and use to contribute to the corporate strategy.
"If the large company wants to survive they will need to drastically change. Continuous reinvention will be the new normal.  Companies who think it's enough to have one great business model are disposable; they will get big and then disappear. The ones that continuously reinvent themselves will be around for the long haul." - Dr. Alexander Osterwalder.

Why Ordinary People Bear Economic Risks and Donald Trump Doesn treddit
Thirty years ago, on its opening day in 1984, Donald Trump stood in a dark topcoat on the casino floor at Atlantic City's Trump Plaza, celebrating his new investment as the finest building in Atlantic City and possibly the nation .
Last week, the Trump Plaza folded and the Trump Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy, leaving some 1,000 employees without jobs.
Trump, meanwhile, was on Twitter claiming he had "nothing to do with Atlantic City," and praising himself for his "great timing" in getting out of the investment.
In America, people with lots of money can easily avoid the consequences of bad bets and big losses by cashing out at the first sign of trouble.
The laws protect them through limited liability and bankruptcy.
But workers who move to a place like Atlantic City for a job, invest in a home there, and build their skills, have no such protection. Jobs vanish, skills are suddenly irrelevant, and home values plummet.
They're stuck with the mess.
Bankruptcy was designed so people could start over. But these days, the only ones starting over are big corporations, wealthy moguls, and Wall Street.
Corporations are even using bankruptcy to break contracts with their employees. When American Airlines went into bankruptcy three years ago, it voided its labor agreements and froze its employee pension plan .
After it emerged from bankruptcy last year and merged with U.S. Airways, America's creditors were fully repaid, its shareholders came out richer than they went in, and its CEO got a severance package valued at $19.9 million .
But American's former employees got shafted.
Wall Street doesn't worry about failure, either. As you recall, the Street almost went belly up six years ago after risking hundreds of billions of dollars on bad bets.
A generous bailout from the federal government kept the bankers afloat. And since then, most of the denizens of the Street have come out just fine.
Yet more than 4 million American families have so far have lost their homes. They were caught in the downdraft of the Street's gambling excesses.
They had no idea the housing bubble would burst, and didn't read the fine print in the mortgages the bankers sold them.
But they weren't allowed to declare bankruptcy and try to keep their homes.
When some members of Congress tried to amend the law to allow homeowners to use bankruptcy, the financial industry blocked the bill.
There's no starting over for millions of people laden with student debt, either.
Student loan debt has more than doubled since 2006, from $509 billion to $1.3 trillion . It now accounts for 40 percent of all personal debt -- more than credit card debts and auto loans.
But the bankruptcy law doesn't cover student debts. The student loan industry made sure of that.
If former students can't meet their payments, lenders can garnish their paychecks. (Some borrowers, still behind by the time they retire, have even found chunks taken out of their Social Security checks.)
The only way borrowers can reduce their student debt burdens is to prove in a separate lawsuit that repayment would impose an "undue hardship" on them and their dependents.
This is a stricter standard than bankruptcy courts apply to gamblers trying to reduce their gambling debts.
You might say those who can't repay their student debts shouldn't have borrowed in the first place. But they had no way of knowing just how bad the jobs market would become. Some didn't know the diplomas they received from for-profit colleges weren't worth the paper they were written on.
A better alternative would be to allow former students to use bankruptcy where the terms of the loans are clearly unreasonable (including double-digit interest rates, for example), or the loans were made to attend schools whose graduates have very low rates of employment after graduation.
Economies are risky. Some industries rise and others implode, like housing. Some places get richer, and others drop, like Atlantic City. Some people get new jobs that pay better, many lose their jobs or their wages.
The basic question is who should bear these risks. As long as the laws shield large investors while putting the risks on ordinary people, investors will continue to make big bets that deliver jackpots when they win but create losses for everyone else.
Average working people need more fresh starts. Big corporations, banks, and Donald Trump need fewer.

BSE sensex
(The index is now close to…)
NEW DELHI: With the US Federal Reserve uncertainty out of the way, the Indian markets are well placed to surpass their previous record highs on both the Sensex and the Nifty in the next few trading sessions.
Both the Sensex and the Nifty touched their respect record highs on September 8, 2014. The S&P BSE Sensex' record high is placed at 27354.99 and the life high of the 50-share Nifty index is placed at 8180.20.
Fresh buying and a bout of short-coverings helped the Nifty cross the 8,100 mark this week. The index is now close to its all-time high and the momentum suggests that the Nifty will soon hit a fresh high.
Fitch Ratings on Monday also said that US Fed interest rate hike - which could be expected by mid-2015 - will not cause a major disruption in emerging markets (EMs), including India. According to Fitch, India's credit profile is much stronger than other EM peers.
According to experts, valuations of the Indian markets are still not very high. Nifty P/E is at 16, which is substantially lower than its high of 25.
"Since May, I have stood by my forecast of the Sensex hitting 30,000 by the year of 2014. We can expect some slowdown in the markets in the first quarter of 2015 as FII inflows come to a standstill and the US raises its Federal Funds rate," said Raghu Kumar, Cofounder of RKSV.
"I would expect a quarterly growth of 3-5 per cent, which would pin the Sensex at around 31,500 by the end of March and 35,000 at the end of the 2015," he added.
We have collated a list of five less-known stocks where brokerages have initiated coverage in the month of September. These stocks have the potential to deliver up to 63 per cent return in the next 12-18 months:
Kitex Garments: Target Price set at Rs 615
Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on the Kochi-based stock with a 'buy' recommendation. The stock has already rallied nearly 500 per cent so far in the year 2014.
The company is in the business of manufacturing and exporting infant garments. It derives 85 per cent of its revenue from the sale of infant garments and the balance 15 per cent from the sale of fabric to Kitex Childrenwear.
KTG is in the process of adding some large clients in FY15 apart from deepening business with existing clients like Gerber, Toys R Us, Jockey, Mothercare and Carter's.
"Going forward, KTG intends to improve its revenue mix in favor of high margin clients like Toys R Us, Jockey and Mothercare, who procure high value-added products which will drive continued margin improvement," the report said.
"We expect KTG to post a 24.6 per cent revenue CAGR coupled with a 700bp margin expansion over FY14-FY17E. Hence, we expect PAT to post 40 per cent CAGR over FY14-17E. With 60 per cent capacity utilization currently, we expect ramp-up of existing capacities and minimal expansion capex," the report said.
"Given strong balance sheet and significant free cash flows, RoCE and RoE should improve from 37 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively, to 58 per cent and 39 per cent over FY14-17E," the report added.
 
Pennar Industries Ltd: Target price set at Rs 81
Midcap steel company Pennar Industries is in a strong bull run. The stock has surged over 140 per cent so far in the year 2014 and the rally is set to continue as the economic activity picks up, say analysts.
IndiaNivesh sees immense potential in the stock in the next 12 months. They value the stock at a conservative PE multiple of 10x to FY16E EPS (Rs. 8.1), which gives the target price of Rs 81.
Steel products business is expected to grow to more than Rs 450 crore in FY15. The company is expecting double-digit growth in the railways business in FY15. As of now, the railways business has an order book of Rs 120 crore.
All verticals of the company are generating positive cash flows and the management is confident of increasing cash profits in FY15 vs the previous fiscal.
According to the brokerage, corporate action by the company on getting subsidiary (PEBS) separately listed on exchanges could be the additional trigger. Pennar Industries is trading at P/E multiple of 8.8x FY15E and 5.9x FY16E earnings estimate, which is well below 14.3x - three-year historical average.
"Average ROE for the company in the past three years has been 12.9 per cent. In FY15E and FY16E, the ROE of the company is likely to improve to 16.4 per cent and 20.3 per cent respectively on the back of increased capacity utilization and margin expansion," the report said.
Century Plyboard: Target price set at Rs 156
Century Plyboard (CPBI) is India's leading plywood producer with the highest volume and revenue. CPBI and Greenply dominate the organised plywood market with a combined 50% market share. CPBI commands 5 per cent premium over its nearest brand and 20% premium over products of unorganised companies.
IIFL initiated coverage on Century Plyboard (CPBI) with a buy recommendation and one-year target of Rs156. They expect CPBI to record 40 per cent earnings CAGR over FY14-FY17.

A massive boycott of classes is a sign that Hong Kongs student movement is finally waking upThe Future of Hong Kong
September 22, 2014
Thousands of students and hundreds of academics in Hong Kong are boycotting university classes this week to protest Beijing’s restrictive proposal  for how the semi-autonomous territory should choose its leaders. Organizers said over 13,000 students from 25 universities staged a sit-in at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. About  400 academics  have also pledged to boycott this week.

The demonstration is significant, and not just because it comes ahead of another mass protest on Oct. 1 by the pro-democracy group Occupy Hong Kong, which has pledged to bring the city’s financial center to a standstill. It may signal the awakening and coming together of the local student movement, which has been divided, disillusioned or inactive for much of the past three decades.

— Jeffie Lam (@jeffielam) September 22, 2014
Hong Kong is home to some 80,000 students, about 1% of the overall population. Though young people participate in annual demonstrations on June 4, to commemorate the Tiananmen crackdown, and July 1st, when the city was returned to China, most youngsters have become more interested in their studies and potential career opportunities than politics.
According to researchers  (registration required), that’s because previous student movements have been disappointing. In the 1960s, leftist students agitated for reunification with the Chinese motherland, a campaign that was cut short by China’s violent and ideologically extremist Cultural Revolution. Then in the 1980s, another movement to establish a unified democratic China was torpedoed by Beijing’s brutal crackdown of pro-democracy protesters in 1989.

Thus, just as students were pushing ahead reform and democracy movements in South Korea, Indonesia, and  Burma in the 1980s and 1990s, Hong Kong’s students were growing disillusioned and pulling back from local politics. “Unlike elsewhere in Southeast and Northeast Asia, Hong Kong’s students have not played a crucial role in the political development of the state,” Stephen Ortmann wrote in 2012 in the book Student Activism in Asia.
That may be starting to change. Unlike past generations, Hong Kong’s young residents increasingly identify themselves as “Hong Kongers”  over just “Chinese.” More are seeing their problems—fewer job prospects and sky-high rental and property prices—as directly related to  Beijing’s influence over the city-state.
And as in the 1980s, Hong Kong students may be taking inspiration from other student protests in Greater China. Students in Taiwan occupied the legislature for three weeks this spring to oppose a trade pact with China.
“We are willing to pay the price for democracy,” Alex Chow, secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, 0ne of the city’s student unions, told rallygoers today. This week’s boycott, he said, is meant “to wake up society—let them know our city’s death knell is ringing.”

Villages in Bandipora under water  farmers loselivelihoodA Kashmiri flood victim carrying a sack containing relief material walks on a parapet towards village Teing near Srinagar, Sunday, Sept. 14, 2014. (Source: AP photo)
Written by Ruwa Shah | Bandipora | Posted: September 22, 2014 7:22 pm
Fifteen to twenty villages in North Kashmir’s Bandipora district came under water on Wednesday night losing their livelihood for at least three years.
When water levels in Srinagar receded, the Jhelum wrecked its havoc upon the paddy fields and apple orchards that were to be harvested in this month and has affected the livelihood of 2000 families.
Ghulam Rasool, a native of Check-Ganistan in Sumbal is the owner of 300 hectares of land – paddy fields and apple orchards. Rasool has forty members in his family, who are completely dependent on the agricultural land for the bread and butter.
“This was the time we used to collect rice and apples from our field. The color is perfect yellow which means it is ready to harvest but destiny had some other plans for us,” said Rasool. “I don’t know how me and my family is going to survive for the next five years,” he added.
Villages like Ankhola, Check-ganistan, Ganistan, Sumbal, Daehar and villages lying at the border of Wular lake have been drastically affected by the floods.
The entire village comprising of 700 families in Check-ganistan rely on the agriculture. Not a single family holds a business unit or is in proper job in the entire area.
“I did not look for a job, as we had enough land to survive upon. But now it’s gone. Our livelihood is gone,” said Akhtar Ahmad of the area.

German giants spend $25 billion on U.S. rivalsGerman giants spend $25 billion to buy U.S. rivals
By Mark Thompson   @MarkThompsonCNN September 22, 2014: 10:32 AM ET
LONDON (CNNMoney)
European companies just can't get enough of their U.S. rivals.
Two German firms snapped up U.S. competitors for $25 billion before the opening bell Monday, looking beyond record stock prices and a stronger dollar to acquire advanced technology in booming sectors.
In the bigger of the two takeovers, German drug group Merck KGaA ( MKGAF ) will buy Sigma-Aldrich ( SIAL ), based in St Louis, Missouri, for about $17 billion in cash. Merck is offering Sigma shareholders a 37% premium to Friday's closing price.
Merck described the deal as a "quantum leap" that would create a life sciences business better able to compete in the market for research, drugs and biotechnology.
Aging populations in the rich world and rising disposable incomes in many emerging markets are boosting demand for health care, even as many governments demand lower costs, driving a surge in corporate activity .
There were 33 mergers and acquisitions in the sector in the second quarter -- worth $14.5 billion -- according to PwC, up from 23 in the same period last year.
Energy is another hot sector.
Siemens ( SIEGY ) said Monday it was buying Dresser-Rand ( DRC ), of Houston, Texas, for $7.6 billion in cash, or $83 per share. Dresser-Rand closed Friday at $79.91, up more than 17% for the week.
Dresser-Rand is an oil services and power generation technology company. It will give Siemens greater exposure to the U.S. fracking boom .

U.S. stocks hit new record highs last week, helped by a reassurance from the Federal Reserve that interest rates won't rise any time soon despite stronger growth that is boosting corporate profits.
The dollar has gained 8% against the euro, and 3.5% against the pound, since May -- making U.S. assets more expensive for European buyers.
But that isn't stopping executives eager to find stronger growth than Europe can offer .
There have been 397 European takeovers of U.S. companies, worth nearly $156 billion, so far this year. That's up from 339 deals worth $25.6 billion in the same period of 2013.
Of this year's deals, 55 were by German firms, up from 42 in 2013.
The figures include the Siemens/Dresser-Rand deal, but not the Merck/Sigma-Aldrich deal.

Hyderabad, Sept. 22,
YuppTV, the US-based over-the-top (OTT) content player that distributes TV channels through the Internet, will raise $20 million (Rs 120 crore) in the second round funding in the next three months. The company is in talks with the private equity players and it hopes to complete the process in three months.
Serial entrepreneur and founder of the testing tools firm AppLabs Sashi Reddi invested $2.5 million (about Rs 16 crore) to pick 10 per cent in the firm, promoted by Uday Reddy. Prior to that, it got $5, 00,000 from family rounds to build the firm.
“We will use the proceeds from the second round to increase our customer base, with a focus in the Caribbean and Latin American countries. Part of the funds would also go to acquiring a niche player,” Uday told Business Line here.
With an Indian arm located in Hyderabad, the company conducts research in content distribution technologies. It employs 145 people
The firm, which mostly serves the Indian Diaspora in the US, first found the serious need for Indian television content while working in the Caribbean area for Nortel. With a subscribe base of about 80 lakhs including about one lakh paid users, the firm distributes about 200 channels in 12 Indian languages and English.
It made revenues of $10-11 million last year ended December 2013.
“Our technological solutions help you to access the content you missed to watch from our cloud storage. Our development team works on improving the content distribution platform and creation of apps (applications) that work on different mobile operating systems,” Uday said.
Media Player
The company has recently launched YuppTV Media Player that allows the users to switch from one gadget to another yet continue to watch the same programme.
Uday said there was a significant change in the customer preferences. “Watching TV is no longer a linear, top-down distribution of content. “Content distribution will become more and more driven by consumers,” he said.

Soon you can train your smartphone to respond togesturesResearchers have now developed a new form of low-power wireless sensing technology that recognises gestures in the space around the phone. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
PTI | Posted: September 22, 2014 7:44 pm
Researchers, including one of Indian-origin, have developed new wireless sensing technology that could allow users to ‘train’ their smartphones to recognise and respond to hand gestures near the device.
University of Washington researchers said some smartphones are starting to incorporate 3-D gesture sensing based on cameras, but cameras consume significant battery power and require a clear view of the user’s hands.
Researchers have now developed a new form of low-power wireless sensing technology that recognises gestures in the space around the phone.
The technology – developed in the labs of Matt Reynolds and Shwetak Patel, UW associate professors of electrical engineering and of computer science and engineering – uses the phone’s wireless transmissions to sense nearby gestures, so it works when a device is out of sight in a pocket or bag and could easily be built into future smartphones and tablets.
“Today’s smartphones have many different sensors built in, ranging from cameras to accelerometers and gyroscopes that can track the motion of the phone itself,” Reynolds said.
“We have developed a new type of sensor that uses the reflection of the phone’s own wireless transmissions to sense nearby gestures, enabling users to interact with their phones even when they are not holding the phone, looking at the display or touching the screen,” he said.
When a person makes a call or an app exchanges data with the Internet, a phone transmits radio signals on a 2G, 3G or 4G cellular network to communicate with a cellular base station.
When a user’s hand moves through space near the phone, the user’s body reflects some of the transmitted signal back toward the phone.
The new system uses multiple small antennas to capture the changes in the reflected signal and classify the changes to detect the type of gesture performed.
In this way, tapping, hovering and sliding gestures could correspond to various commands for the phone, such as silencing a ring, changing which song is playing or muting the speakerphone.
Because the phone’s wireless transmissions pass easily through the fabric of clothing or a handbag, the system works even when the phone is stowed away.
A group of 10 study participants tested the technology by performing 14 different hand gestures – including hovering, sliding and tapping – in various positions around a smartphone.
Each time, the phone was calibrated by learning a user’s hand movements, then trained itself to respond. The team found the smartphone recognised gestures with about 87 per cent accuracy.
Researchers will present their project, called SideSwipe, at the Association for Computing Machinery’s Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology in Honolulu next month.

Income Tax department launches enhanced, 'single window' website for taxpayers

Central Board of Direct Taxes
("An updated version of the…)
NEW DELHI: A revamped online portal of the Income Tax department was launched today which will enable taxpayers to file returns or apply for a PAN card through a 'single window' format.
Taxpayers so far had to go to different official websites of the I-T department for these matters.
"An updated version of the website -- www.incometaxindia.gov.in -- will act as the 'single window' for all activities and online services offered by the I-T department.
"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was supposed to inaugurate it but due to medical compulsions he could not do so," said a senior I-T official.
As the website is an important tool for taxpayers, the department launched it today without any delay, the officer added.
The new version of the website has been made more user- friendly and robust and can handle a larger number of visits at a time, the officer said, adding that all the links to PAN card data and e-filing have been centralised on this portal.
"The new website has enhanced features and taxpayers will be able to file their I-T returns online and even apply for a PAN on this portal. (These aspects) were till now hosted on a different official web address of the department," the officer said.
Apart from I-T rules and laws, the website also has 106 other Acts under the IPC and CrPC for ready reference.
Separate icons have been provided on the improved portal providing the locations of various I-T offices in the country, including that of the important office of the 'Ombudsman'.
The website will also allow taxpayers to get information about various notices and circulars which are issued from time to time along with other regular developments in the department.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had envisaged such a website in its ambitious 'Vision 2020' document prepared a few years back and the new website is a culmination of efforts to give better services to taxpayers, the officer said.

So you've been hacked... Now what?
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
It's easy to get hacked. And yes, it can happen to you.
Follow this advice from actual hackers, and you'll be a lot safer online.
1. Turn off your phone's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Hackers are religious about this. Keeping these features "on" all the time makes it easy for strangers to slip into your phone.
The problem? If you keep Wi-Fi and Bluetooth active, hackers can see what networks you've connected to before, spoof them and trick your phone into connecting to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices that hackers carry around.
Once connected to your phone, hackers can bombard your device with malware, steal data or spy on you. And you won't even notice.
So, turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when you need them. Turn them off when you don't.
2. Use two-step authentication. Nowadays, a single password isn't enough. They get exposed all the time .
Lots of email and social media services offer an extra later of protection: two-step authentication -- essentially a second, temporary password.
For example, when you set this up with Google, ( GOOG ) Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) and LinkedIn, ( LNKD , Tech30 ) they ask you for a secret code every time you log in from a new device. You immediately get a text message with a six-digit number.
It's an effective way to keep out hackers. Even if someone gets your password, they'd still need your phone too -- an unlikely scenario.
3. Create a smart password strategy. For the select few websites with your most sensitive information (email, bank), create some long and unique passphrases, like +hisPl@tinumDr@gonBreathesF1re.
For everything else? Use a password manager. This type of program stores all your passwords online, so you can make each one different, and you won't have to remember them all.
But only use a password manager that encrypts them on your device. LastPass and Password Safe do this.
(Why not use a password manager for everything? One master password unlocks them all. You create a single point of failure.)
Change all of your passwords more than once a year.

4. Use HTTPS on every website. Install the HTTPS Everywhere tool developed by the pro-privacy Electronic Frontier Foundation . It encrypts all the information your browser is sending between your computer and websites.
If you only see HTTP in the address bar, anyone can spy on your Internet session.
5. Bulk up your home Wi-Fi. Setting up Wi-Fi at home is a tour through the circles of hell. But these two steps are important.
First, set up a password. Don't keep the default password on the sticker.
Next, the machine will ask what type of security encryption standard you'd like. Choose WPA-2.
Lots of machines default to WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) or WPA (Wireless Protected Access). Avoid them at all costs. A known Wi-Fi flaw can give up your password in seconds.
6. Don't hide your home Wi-Fi. Your home router asks: "Hide the SSID?" If you say yes, then your devices are forced to "actively scan" for the home network you're trying to hide. Sure, they'll connect. But as a result, your device "actively scans" for networks all the time.
Your laptop and phone are more susceptible to connecting to strangers' unsafe Wi-Fi networks.
"You're actually setting yourself back five years in terms of security," said Ben Smith, an experienced Wi-Fi hacker who's worked on secretive government projects.
7. Think twice before buying an Internet-connected device. Do you really need a "smart" fridge or oven ?
Companies are still figuring out the kinks -- especially the tiny ones raising money on crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo , according to Duo Security researcher Mark Stanislav.
Tech companies are in a rush to slap the Internet on everything. Cool features get all the attention. Privacy and safety don't.
As a case in point, a foul-mouthed hacker hijacked a baby's monitor last year.
"You might be getting told things are secure, when they're not," said Stanislav, who hacks devices for research.

CEOs of aviation cos to meet minister Ashok Raju on Tuesday
The aviation minister has been promising that he will persuade states to lower sales tax on ATF and this is certainly one thing that's expected to come up in the meeting tomorrow.
Post your opinion here
06:00 pm
The CEOs of India's airlines are scheduled to hold their first meeting with civil aviation minister P Ashok Gajapathi Raju on Tuesday. In this meeting, the aviation sector leaders are expected to point out to the minister how difficult it is to operate in India, given its high cost aviation environment. Leaders from SpiceJet , Indigo, GoAir, Air India, Jet Airways , Vistara and AirAsia India are expected to attend this meeting.
The first and foremost issue is the extremely taxed aviation turbine fuel (ATF) which is a state subject and not much that Raju can do about. But the aviation minister has been promising that he will persuade states to lower sales tax on ATF and this is certainly one thing that's expected to come up in the meeting tomorrow.
Also, high airport charges and the new proposed policy for regional and remote air connectivity which forces airlines to mount flights to areas that are remote and where flying is unviable.
As of now, the government is not offering any viability gap funding for mounting flights to these regions and the airlines are all opposed to it. It adds significantly to the airplanes bottom lines and this is something that they don't want to participate in.
Another issue that is expected to come up is the 5/20 rule which forces airlines to have a five year domestic mandatory operation and a fleet of 20 aircraft before they can fly aboard. Minister Raju is expected to take a quick decision on the 5/20 after tomorrow’s meeting but for all the issues there may still be more discussions required.

Americans hate all public schools  except the ones their own kids attendBy Catherine Rampell September 22 Follow @crampell
In my column last Friday, I mentioned a peculiar paradox: that Americans think public schools nationwide are terrible — except for the ones their own kids attend. (This is not so different from Fenno’s Paradox , which refers to American attitudes toward Congress vs. toward their own congressperson.)
For several decades,  Phi Delta Kappa International/Gallup has been surveying Americans about their attitudes towards public education. Three separate survey questions ask respondents to give grades – A, B, C, D or “fail” —  to denote the quality of schools. One asks about public schools “in the nation as a whole,” another about public schools “in your community,” and the last about “the school your oldest child attends.”
Here are the shares of poll respondents who give a grade of “A” or “B” to each of the questions.  Responses for the question about “the school your oldest child attends” refer only to parents of kids who attend public school; the others refer to the full sample of poll respondents:
Source: Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll.
A few observations: People are generally happy with the public school their own kids attend, though A and B grades have fallen from their peak of 79 percent in 2011 down to 67 percent today. Public school parents consistently view their own kids’ schools better than respondents overall view schools in the “community,” and substantially better than public schools nationwide. Note also that the numbers bounce around over time a bit, but appraisals of public schools in the “community” have generally been trending upward since the early 1980s.
As I mentioned in the column, other poll questions suggest that Americans believe the quality of public schools nationwide is declining. Here’s another question that’s asked more intermittently:
Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll.
This perception appears to be at odds with other available datapoints reflecting the quality of public schools, however. Long-term trend data from the  National Assessment of Educational Progress (as well as other indicators like dropout rates and  high school enrollment in calculus classes ) suggest that at the national level, public school outcomes are improving.

C.B.W. has two daddies -- even in Houston; and the gay one gets custody  says the juryBy Eugene Volokh September 22 Follow @volokhc
Berwick v. Wagner (Tex. Ct. App. Sept. 11, 2014) , involves Jerry Berwick, Richard Wagner, and their son (or is he?) C.B.W. Berwick and Wagner were two gay men, who were involved with each other from 1994 to 2008. In 1997, they began living together in Houston. In 2003, they got married in Canada. In 2005, they registered as domestic partners in California. And,
In 2005, they entered into a gestational surrogacy agreement with a married woman in California for her to carry a child for them. She was implanted with embryos formed from Berwick’s sperm and donated ova, which resulted in pregnancy and the birth of a son, C.B.W. A California court entered an order entitled “Judgment of Paternity” before C.B.W.’s birth, (1) declaring both Berwick and Wagner each to be a “legal parent” of C.B.W., (2) declaring the surrogate and her husband to not be C.B.W.’s legal parents, (3) ordering the hospital to list Berwick in the space provided for father on the original birth certificate, and (4) ordering the hospital to list Wagner in the space provided for mother on the original birth certificate. After C.B.W.’s birth, Berwick and Wagner brought him to Houston, where they lived together as a family for several years.
But then, in 2008, Berwick broke up with Wagner, concluded that homosexuality was sinful, and started dating (in January 2009) and married (in November 2009) a woman (Shellie) who became his wife. This led to a child custody dispute; Wagner sought an order naming him and Berwick “joint managing conservators” (i.e., giving them joint legal custody), and Berwick responded by asking to be sole managing conservator. Berwick also argued “that Wagner lacked standing as a parent to seek custody because only Berwick, but not Wagner, was biologically related to C.B.W. through use of Berwick’s sperm to conceive C.B.W.” And this led to a jury trial, because in Texas (alone among all states, to my knowledge) there is a right to trial by jury in child custody cases.
The jury, however, gave Wagner (the still gay father) custody, though with visitation for Berwick. Some interesting holdings from the appeal:
1. Texas law gives effect to California judgments of paternity, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.
2. Even though courts have recognized an exception to the Full Faith and Credit Clause when an out-of-state judgment violates the state’s public policy, this doesn’t apply here:
Berwick contends that we should consider the California judgment void because, he asserts, under Texas law, (1) “[a] child can have only one legal father,” and (2) surrogacy agreements are unenforceable unless the intended parents are married persons of opposite gender. Berwick cites no authority for deeming a foreign paternity judgment to be so repugnant to Texas policy to render it void and subject to collateral attack. And Berwick’s arguments ignore the strong state public policies favoring stability and finality in matters of parentage evidenced by numerous statutes. [Citations omitted.-EV]
[Footnote: These policies favoring stability and finality in parent-child relationships have been recognized by Texas courts rejecting arguments similar to Berwick's in the same-sex adoption context. Cf. Goodson v. Castellanos, 214 S.W.3d 741, 745 (Tex. App.-Austin 2007, pet. denied) (rejecting biological mother's argument that judgment creating parent-child relationship between her child and biological mother's ex-girlfriend was void as against Texas public policy and citing the strong policies favoring stability and finality in matters of parentage); Hobbs v. Van Stavern, 249 S.W.3d 1, 2 & 4 n.4 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (citing same policy considerations in rejecting biological mother’s untimely collateral attack on same-sex adoption by ex-girlfriend while applying statute rendering adoption judgment unassailable after six months); see also in RE S.D.S.-C, No. 04-08-00593-CV, 2009 WL 702777, at *2 (Tex. App.-San Antonio March 18, 2009, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (rejecting, as untimely, collateral challenge to same-sex adoption brought four years after judgment entered).]
3. Berwick was rightly precluded from arguing to the jury that his being the biological father should count in favor of his custody claim:
Nothing under Texas law supports Berwick['s] argument for applying a presumption in favor of a biological “parent” over a parent acquiring “parent” status through other legal channels (be it adoption, presumption, or assisted reproduction). Although Berwick’s brief treats these concepts interchangeably throughout, under the plain language of the Texas Family Code, only the difference between a parent and a non-parent has legal significance in determining who should be appointed sole or joint managing conservator of a child, e.g., TEX. FAM. CODE § 153.131(a); the difference between a biological parent and a non-biological parent does not. Berwick cites no authority otherwise.
4. The trial court didn’t abuse its discretion when it struck five jurors who said they so strongly opposed homosexuality that they couldn’t be impartial in the case. This didn’t constitute impermissible discrimination based on the jurors’ religion, but rather permissible exclusion of jurors based on their “unequivocally indicat[ing] that they held such strong convictions that they could not base their decisions on the law and evidence.”
5. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury’s findings that Berwick and Wagner shouldn’t have joint custody, and that Wagner should have sole custody, subject to visitation by Berwick (paragraph break added):
According to Berwick, “in naming Wagner the sole managing conservator the jury ignored the overwhelming weight of the evidence, which fails to support their conclusion.” Berwick points to the opinion of the two psychologists who testified at trial, Anderson and Laval, that the parties should be appointed joint managing conservators. Berwick cites trial evidence and these expert’s opinions about both Wagner’s and Berwick’s sincere commitment to parenting C.B.W. Berwick highlights the reasons that Laval cited as tipping the scale in favor of Berwick’s being permitted to establish C.B.W.’s residence, such as Shellie’s ability to stay home to care for C.B.W., and the loving ways in which Berwick and Shellie interact with C.B.W.
The focus of Berwick’s analysis and evidence he discusses, however, does not go to the factors relevant to determination of sole versus joint managing conservatorship. All of the witnesses agreed that both Berwick and Wagner love C.B.W. and are good parents.
But whether appointment of one parent as sole managing conservator is in a child’s best interest turns not on the parent’s ability to parent individually, but instead on several statutory factors related to the parents’ ability to effectively co-parent. These include whether the parents can encourage and accept a positive parent-child relationship with the other parent, whether the parties can prioritize the child’s welfare, and whether the parents can reach shared decisions in the child’s best interest.
Although Berwick and Shellie testified at trial that they accept Wagner as a parent and are willing and able to co-parent with him, they also both admitted this attitude was new. Berwick testified that he had decided to accept Wagner as C.B.W.’s parent during the course of the actual trial; Shellie testified that she changed her mind about Wagner’s role in the “last couple of months” before trial.
Faced with this testimony on the one hand, and evidence about Berwick’s unwillingness to recognize Wagner as a parent entitled to participate in joint decision-making for much of the four years leading up to the trial on the other hand, the jury could have resolved this point against Berwick. There is factually sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that appointing Wagner as sole managing conservator is in C.B.W.’s best interest.

Telangana to spend Rs 4 250 cr on first phase of loan waiverTelangana to spend Rs 4,250 cr on first phase of loan waiver
K V Kurmanath
Tweet
Hyderabad, Sept. 22:  
The Telangana Government has allocated Rs 4,250 crore for the first phase of farm loan waiver scheme. The government has estimated that it would cost Rs 17,000 crore to the exchequer to implement the scheme. It is expected to benefit 36 lakh farmers who had taken loans of Rs one lakh or below before March 31, 2014.
The Group of Ministers, headed by Agriculture Minister Pocharam Srinivasa Reddy, has submitted its report to Chief Minister K Chandrasekhara Rao here on Monday.
The mandate of the panel was to prepare the modalities for the implementation of the scheme. Like its peer Telugu Desam in Andhra Pradesh, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) made a poll promise, offering to waive the loans.
The Telangana Government was considering a few options to implement the scheme. It includes giving the farmers a government to match their loans. This, however, would have resulted in piling up of the dues. The banks have denied loans to the farmers who have not cleared the dues, severely impacting the liquidity position of farmers in the ongoing kharif season.
In the first phase, the Government would directly deposit the amount in the savings accounts of farmers. “I hope this disbursal would prompt the banks to give fresh loans. If they don’t get loans by the month end, they might lose the insurance cover,” Pocharam Srinivasa Reddy said, talking to reporters after submitting the report to the Chief Minister.
He said the GoM would hold a fresh round of talks with the bankers to discuss the roll-out plan.

German giants spend $25 billion to buy U.S. rivalsGerman giants spend $25 billion to buy U.S. rivals
By Mark Thompson   @MarkThompsonCNN September 22, 2014: 10:32 AM ET
LONDON (CNNMoney)
European companies just can't get enough of their U.S. rivals.
Two German firms snapped up U.S. competitors for $25 billion before the opening bell Monday, looking beyond record stock prices and a stronger dollar to acquire advanced technology in booming sectors.
In the bigger of the two takeovers, German drug group Merck KGaA ( MKGAF ) will buy Sigma-Aldrich ( SIAL ), based in St Louis, Missouri, for about $17 billion in cash. Merck is offering Sigma shareholders a 37% premium to Friday's closing price.
Merck described the deal as a "quantum leap" that would create a life sciences business better able to compete in the market for research, drugs and biotechnology.
Aging populations in the rich world and rising disposable incomes in many emerging markets are boosting demand for health care, even as many governments demand lower costs, driving a surge in corporate activity .
There were 33 mergers and acquisitions in the sector in the second quarter -- worth $14.5 billion -- according to PwC, up from 23 in the same period last year.
Energy is another hot sector.
Siemens ( SIEGY ) said Monday it was buying Dresser-Rand ( DRC ), of Houston, Texas, for $7.6 billion in cash, or $83 per share. Dresser-Rand closed Friday at $79.91, up more than 17% for the week.
Dresser-Rand is an oil services and power generation technology company. It will give Siemens greater exposure to the U.S. fracking boom .

U.S. stocks hit new record highs last week, helped by a reassurance from the Federal Reserve that interest rates won't rise any time soon despite stronger growth that is boosting corporate profits.
The dollar has gained 8% against the euro, and 3.5% against the pound, since May -- making U.S. assets more expensive for European buyers.
But that isn't stopping executives eager to find stronger growth than Europe can offer .
There have been 397 European takeovers of U.S. companies, worth nearly $156 billion, so far this year. That's up from 339 deals worth $25.6 billion in the same period of 2013.
Of this year's deals, 55 were by German firms, up from 42 in 2013.
The figures include the Siemens/Dresser-Rand deal, but not the Merck/Sigma-Aldrich deal.

BJP may contest all seats in Maharashtra  says Rajiv Pratap RudySep 22, 2014 at 07:35pm IST
BJP may contest all seats in Maharashtra, says Rajiv Pratap Rudy

New Delhi: Not relenting on seat sharing in Maharashtra, BJP on Monday said that it would fight in all the 288 assembly seats if it is "compelled" to part ways with Shiv Sena, its ally of 25 years.
The statement from Rajiv Pratap Rudy, BJP's General Secretary in charge of Maharashtra, came on a day when impasse over seat-sharing between both parties persisted with BJP leaders charging Sena with making no concrete offers but just talking of a seat-sharing formula through TV channels.
"In a contingent situation that the BJP is compelled not to contest with Shiv Sena, we would go it alone on all 288 seats but we will prefer that Shiv Sena comes along," Rudy said.
"In a contingent situation that the BJP is compelled not to contest with Shiv Sena, we would go it alone on all 288 seats but we will prefer that Shiv Sena comes along," Rudy said.

Party sources said they have prepared a list of candidates for a majority of seats barring "20-30" where they were still looking for appropriate names or expecting leaders from other parties to join them.
"We are not in favour of breaking the alliance. But we are also not in a mood of tolerating their (Sena) uncompromising attitude. There can be flexibility but we are getting to hear their proposals only on news channels," a BJP leader said.
Thackeray had made it clear in Mumbai on Sunday that his final offer to BJP was 119 seats while Sena will fight 151 seats, leaving 18 for smaller allies. BJP, which had said both parties fight 135 seats each, had rejected the proposal.
BJP is also cold to the idea of projecting Thackeray as the chief ministerial candidate of the alliance. There were reports that BJP President Amit Shah spoke to Thackeray today and urged him to reconsider his stand on seat-sharing. But party leaders declined to confirm that Shah made any such call even as they said "messengers" of top leaders of both parties are in touch.
Shah is believed to have spoken to Thackeray on Sunday when the party held its Central Election Committee and Parliamentary Board meeting. Both the meetings, which had gone on for over three hours, were attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah, both of whom spent some time together separately, and other leaders.

Maharashtra: BJP-Shiv Sena  Congress-NCP alliances hang in balance over seat-sharing for polls22
0
New Delhi: The two principal alliances that play the major role in the  Maharashtra political scene are floundering in the heat of elections. The seat-sharing tussle continues between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on the one hand and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiv Sena on the other.
The NCP has now said that it will hold discussions with the Congress on Tuesday morning to resolve the deadlock.
"The Congress has told us that we will sit together and discuss seat sharing. Tomorrow morning, our party president Ajit Pawar, Bhujbal and I will discuss all issues with the Congress," NCP leader Praful Patel said.
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #congress #ncp #shiv sena
He also asked the Congress to consider the NCP's demand for more seats. "The Congress should consider our demand for more seats over and above the share of 124 seats," Patel said.
Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan has welcomed the talks insisting that his party, the Congress, and the NCP remain friends. "The discussion is going on with the NCP. In such talks there are no deadlines. We are friends and the situation is being discussed," he said.
So far the Congress has refused to toe the NCP's ultimatum saying that it can give only 124 seats to the NCP instead of the 144 demanded by them.
Meanwhile, on the other front, the BJP has put the ball in the Shiv Sena's court over seat-sharing.
"We are ready to fight on 130 seats. We are also ready to fight on those seats which the Sena has not won in the last 30 years. This is a very liberal proposal and we hope that the Sena considers our proposal," BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
On Monday, BJP President Amit Shah called  on Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and urged him to not end their 25-year-old alliance.
Shiv Sena had offered 119 seats to BJP and 18 to other allies, leaving them with 151 seats out of 288. The BJP rejected the deal and called for a meeting of all Maharashtra party workers on Tuesday.

Coimbatore: Maintaining that he was not against privatisation, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju Pusapati on Monday said that it alone would not yield results and stressed upon the need for working as a team.
"We need to encourage more Indian players, be it in the private sector or government to improve and strengthen flight connectivity. There is ample scope for improvement both in air cargo and passenger traffic," he said interacting with members of the local chapter of Indian Chamber of commerce and Industry.
Responding to their plea for better flight connectivity and speedy completion of airport expansion project, he said that there is need for a mix of both private and public participation in such infrastructure projects.
"We need to encourage more Indian players, be it in the private sector or government to improve and strengthen flight connectivity," Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said.

"Of the 450 plus airstrips across the country, activity is visible in less than a 100," he said. In response to another appeal for including Coimbatore in the Asian Air Transport Agreement for operation of flights by foreign airliners to the city, he said, "a number of bilateral agreements are still unutilised.
"We do not want to reduce connectivity, but at the same time look to contribute to the GDP of India by encouraging more Indian players."

Over 600 scholars sign letter against BDSBy Eugene Kontorovich September 22
Over 600 academics thus far have signed a new letter opposing an academic boycott of Israel. The signatories include at least one Nobel Prize winner, law school deans, and leading scholars in several fields (that is just based on the some of the signatories I personally know; I have not looked over the whole list).
The statement takes no position on the Israeli-Arab conflict, and tries to to be as neutral as possible about everything other than BDS itself. The key parts of the letter are below; it is open for signature by any college or university faculty faculty or academic staff, including librarians, researchers, post doctorates, etc.
We, the undersigned … oppose faculty or student boycotts of Israel’s academic institutions, scholars and students.
Our opposition is rooted in the following core principles.
1. Academic freedom: The BDS (boycott, divestment and sanctions) movement discriminates against Israeli institutions, professors, and students for no other reason than their nationality and the policies of their government. Thus BDS violates the very principle of academic freedom. Academic boycotts such as those promoted by BDS activists “are antithetical to the fundamental principles of the academy, where we will not hold intellectual exchange hostage to the political disagreements of the moment,” according to a statement signed by 300 university presidents in 2007, and additional statements written by over 250 university presidents last year in response to the ASA boycott of Israel. The American Association of University Professors, other academic organizations, and more than forty Nobel Laureates have opposed all academic boycotts for this reason.
2. Truth: The factual record does not support the accusations and narratives of the BDS movement. Many are based on overstatements, cherry picked evidence, outright falsehood, or on disputed or highly biased data.
3. Peace: The two-state solution – which guarantees to both parties mutual recognition – enjoys the endorsement of the United Nations, the United States, the European Union, and the Arab League. By demonizing and seeking to isolate one of the two parties to the peace process, the anti-Israel BDS movement sets itself apart from the global consensus for peace.
I have signed the letter, and would do so for any such statement about academic boycotts of any country, including those whose policies I particularly detest. I would not want an Iranian leader speaking at my campus , but cannot imagine extending that objection to an Iranian professor. While government control and intimidation in authoritarian countries may make scholarship less reliable or interesting, I cannot see a justification for any non-merit-based boycott. Indeed, I have had some useful correspondence on maritime piracy with Iranian academics.

Dunlop to reopen Sahaganj plant
PTI
Tweet
Kolkata, Sept 22:  
The management of Dunlop India Ltd (DIL) today agreed to reopen its Sahaganj factory after a tripartite meeting held in presence of state Labour Minister Malay Ghatak.
The Dunlop management had declared suspension of work at its Sahaganj factory in West Bengal’s Hooghly district on October 2011 alleging law and order problem at the plant and non—co-operation from workers.
The plant is expected to reopen on September 25 and employees were likely to get Rs 5,000 as lumpsum and rest of the dues was likely to be settled in instalments.
The company management in a statement said during a meeting chaired by the minister, a tripartite agreement was reached for reopening the Sahaganj plant for refurbishment followed by commencement of production in a phased manner, but declined to speak further on the terms of reopening.
The company has about 550 workers on its roll.
The previous Labour Minister Purnendu Bose had alleged there had not been any labour unrest in the factory since the bipartite agreement in 2006 and 306 employees, who had taken early retirement, had not been paid their dues.

IFCI to partly divest stake in Tourism FinanceIFCI to partly divest stake in Tourism Finance Corporation
BS Reporter | Mumbai Sep 23, 2014 12:10 AM IST
IFCI Limited, the state-owned finance company, plans to sell a small stake in Tourism Finance Corporation of India (TFCI).
TFCI is another Delhi-based public financial institution, catering to the financial needs of the tourism industry.
IFCI holds over 42 per cent stake in TFCI. Other promoting entities include State Bank of India (9.19 per cent), Life Insurance Corporation of India (7.7 per cent) and Bank of India (4.7 per cent).
IFCI informed BSE that the company will partially disinvest its shareholding in TFCI in 2014-15. TFCI stock was down by one per cent at Rs 47.7.
However, IFCI will not shed its promoter status. There will not be any strategic divestment. The finance company is only looking to a earn profit on the part-sale of the stake. The cost of investment in TFCI is much less than the ruling price now, said an IFCI executive.
BSE listed tourism finance unit posted a net profit of Rs 18.9 crore for the first quarter ended June 2014 up from Rs 15.8 crore in April-June 2013. The income from operations in Q1 of FY15 was Rs 50 crore up from Rs 45.5 crore in same quarter of FY14.

TVS Motor: Strong on volume growth  margins a concernTVS Motor: Strong on volume growth; margins a concern
T E Narasimhan & Ram Prasad Sahu | Chennai Sep 22, 2014 10:47 PM IST
The sixfold rise in the TVS Motor Company stock — from Rs 30 in September 2013 to Rs 219 now — has its roots in events last year. After nearly three years of a slowdown in new launches, the Chennai-based TVS stepped up the pace of bringing out new vehicles from the second half of 2013-14. As a result, the company’s overall market share improved to 12.6 per cent in the June quarter (now, it is 13.2 per cent). For the company, another major event in 2013-14 was its tie-up with BMW to jointly develop high-end motorcycles (up to 500cc).
Chairman and Managing Director Venu Srinivasan has said the rise in market share results from the engineering the company has done, adding this will help it grow faster in the future.
The volume and market share gains can be attributed to a series of launches, especially in the second half of 2013-14, led by scooter TVS Jupiter, as well as Star City+. Other new products and variants include TVS Sport, TVS Phoenix 125 and TVS Apache.
In addition to the launches, the company has been plugging gaps in its product portfolio, launching the Jupiter in the heavy scooter segment and a more powerful smaller scooter, the Scooty Zest, targeted at women. Through launches such as that of the Scooty Zest, TVS plans to capture 14 per cent share in the domestic market this financial year, selling about 2.2 million two-wheelers, against 1.75 million in 2013-14.
The gains are primarily due to investments in research and development, which increased four per cent year-on-year to Rs 130 crore (1.8 per cent of revenue) for FY14. Advertisement and marketing expenditure increased 37 per cent to Rs 280 crore (3.5 per cent of revenue, against 2.9 per cent last year).
In 2014-15, the environment on the volumes front was expected to improve further, owing to the launch of the new Star City+, the company said.
In a report, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said, “We expect TVS Motor’s lifecycle of brands within its portfolio to increase from historical levels due to better execution on coming launches. This reflects our revised growth assumptions of 26 per cent each for FY15-16. Based on this projection, we think the company should be able to increase market share by 300 basis points to about 15 per cent.”
Analysts at Reliance Securities expect TVS’s volumes to rise 24 per cent to 2.58 million in FY15 and 19 per cent to 3.08 million in FY16.
“Today, we are at the fourth position. We aim to be in the top three players in India, with a stream of product launches every quarter for the next three years, which will significantly strengthen our position,” Srinivasan had told shareholders recently. “One weakness people pointed out was we didn’t have a regular product launch programme. But it was by design, not by accident,” he said.
“It is because we feel we don’t want to launch a product unless we master the field of consumer-led engineering, having deep understanding of consumer psychology and consumer aspiration and convert that to hard engineering and style. Just launching more and more new models will not necessarily improve market share; in fact, it will have bad impact on the bottom line.”
While analysts say the company will meet the Street’s expectations on the volume front, margins remain a concern. For the June quarter, the margin had fallen to a four-quarter low of 5.69 per cent, while revenue rose 31 per cent, helped by volume growth of 22 per cent, compared to the year-ago period.
In a recent report, IDBI Capital said, “While the management sounded extremely optimistic on volume growth momentum continuing across segments (along with market share gains) for TVS, it was equally unconvincing when it came to an explanation for the weak margin in first quarter. We didn’t really get clarity on the road ahead. It does expect to achieve a double-digit margin over the medium term. However, we are not too convinced on the ‘how’ part of it.”
A Karvy report said the company’s margins fell sequentially and remained flat year-on-year, despite a favourable currency. Investors were concerned, as the management said gain in market share was its priority, not margins.
The key to further re-rating will be TVS Motor’s ability to improve its margins, currently lower those of Hero MotoCorp (15 per cent) and Bajaj Auto (20 per cent). While traditional strongholds of executive and premium bikes have helped peers improve volumes and maintain pricing power, TVS Motor has suffered on account of a weak franchise network.
At 16 times, valuations are on a par with those of Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp. Typically, companies with weaker margins and return ratios trade at a discount to category leaders. A lot will depend on TVS’s ability to improve its volume growth. While its plan to launch a product every quarter should help on this front, a large part of margin gains will depend on operating leverage and costs savings. If it manages to improve its margins to double digits and raises market share, it should be counted among the leaders, not an ‘also-ran’.

This robot is better at inserting USB cables than you areBy Rachel Feltman September 22 Follow @rachelfeltman
If you're anything like me, anyway. This robot, presented at the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems , was designed to have great dexterity. To help the robot have a better sense of touch, researchers programmed it to rely on killer eyesight instead of tactile sensors.
The GelSight sensor. (Melanie Gonick)
The robot's finger pad is made of a sensor the researchers call GelSight. A piece of rubber, coated with metallic paint, presses up against the object being grasped. The four edges of the sensor light up in four different colors, which bounce off the rubber when an object deforms it. A camera captures the resulting light, and analyzes the color spectrum to know the exact shape of the object against the rubber pad.
The result, the engineers report , is a robot 100 times more sensitive than a human finger.
The super-accurate USB-inserting skills seen above (the robot got the plug in 34 out of 36 times) didn't actually involve any rotating: The researchers hung the plug in the correct orientation, so the robot just had to lower it into its outlet.
But the researchers told Discover Magazine  that this would actually be much easier than the task of finding the outlet in the first place. The outlet only tolerated about a millimeter of error, so the robot hand had to be incredibly precise. In tests, the robot was only given a GelSight sensor on one finger pad. But with one on each side, it would have no trouble feeling the embossed symbols that distinguish a USB cord -- and rotating as needed.
Realistically, the researchers aren't going to explore the possibility of creating personal USB pluggers for all of us. The robot's ability to plug with accuracy will probably lend itself to more practical applications, such as lining up and inserting screws and bolts.

The latest victim of the Ebola epidemic Pets  left abandoned at zoos in AfricaBy Sarah Larimer September 22 Follow @slarimer

As the Ebola epidemic continues to sweep across West Africa, concern is so great that local zoos are now taking in abandoned wild animals that had once been considered pets, out of fear that the monkeys and cats could spread the deadly virus.
At one Ivory Coast zoo, vets have set up a quarantine zone, with green cages of animals that have been isolated to prevent exposure to the virus, according to an AFP report .
The cages at the Abidjan facility held a two-year-old chimpanzee and a red baboon whose owner had left it on the street. A monkey named Louise sat in one cage, while another cage held two males that hadn't been named.
"As soon as we can, we'll put the (isolated arrivals) in the zoo," with their own species, the zoo's deputy director, Richard Champion, told AFP.
More than 2,700 people have died during this year's Ebola epidemic, according to the World Health Organization. Thousands more confirmed, probable and suspected cases have been reported.
Many have suggested that fruit bats might be to blame for this outbreak, and the WHO also warns that people "should reduce contact with high-risk infected animals (i.e. fruit bats, monkeys or apes) in the affected rainforest areas."
There are no confirmed cases of Ebola in the Ivory Coast, and the animals that have been taken in by the zoo are not infected by the deadly virus.
AFP notes: "Even if they are not carrying the Ebola virus, the beasts taken in by the zoo could be infected with a range of diseases, and at risk of contaminating other animals."
But visitors remain wary.
Take, for example, one frightened woman whom zoo director Samouka Kane remembered. Kane told AFP that the woman walked in "on tiptoe," and told him she was looking for the virus.
"I told her that Ebola doesn't hide in the bushes," he said. "Nor in the eyes of an animal."
Then, there was this case, detailed by AFP:
The zoo's vet, Daouda Soro, said that he had been summoned in haste to Abidjan's military hospital to deal with "an animal who was spreading panic." When he got there, he found a "very small (monkey) who was sleepy but shivering with hunger."
"It was above all Ebola that caused the panic," Soro told AFP.

European shares fall on China growth jittersEuropean shares fall on China growth jitters
Reuters
Tweet
PARIS / LONDON, Sept 22:  
European shares fell on Monday, with a benchmark index retreating from the previous session's near-seven-year high, as concern over the pace of growth in China knocked down mining heavyweights such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.
Shares in Air France-KLM sank 4 percent after the main French pilots union rejected a management proposal for ending a week-old Air France strike. The company said the strike was costing it as much as €20 million ($25.7 million) a day.
UK supermarket chain Tesco also featured among Europe's top losers, sinking 10.2 per cent after the group slashed its earnings forecast - its third warning this year - after finding a fault in its accounts.
Shares in Tesco's rivals also took a beating, with J. Sainsbury down 2.3 percent and Morrisons down 2.1 per cent.
"Tesco has dealt investors a severe blow to confidence, with fellow food retailers also suffering," Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.
"Concerns regarding China, comments from the finance minister and whether additional economic stimulus will be applied also appear to be hitting investor sentiment."
Mining companies were by far the biggest drag on the market, with the STOXX 600 Europe basic resources index down 1.9 per cent, hurt by concern over demand before this week's manufacturing data from top metal consumer China, which is expected to show factory growth is stalling.
Shares in Rio were down 3.4 percent and BHP Billiton was down 2.6 per cent, falling along with prices for such metals as copper, nickel, zinc and aluminium.
Iron ore prices also tumbled, plagued by worries about excess supply. Spot iron ore prices have tumbled by nearly 40 per cent this year, sparking speculation that big London-listed mining companies will have to slash their dividends.
On Sunday, Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said the country will not dramatically alter its economic policy because of any one economic indicator, in remarks that came after many economists lowered growth forecasts after seeing the latest set of weak data.
"News out of China where finance minister Lou poured cold water on hopes that China will take further measures to boost its economy is souring sentiment for stocks," Markus Huber, a senior analyst at Peregrine & Black, said.
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.3 per cent at 1,397.90 points. The index had climbed to near a seven-year high on Friday after Scotland voted against independence.
The index trimmed its losses in afternoon trading after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the ECB stands ready to use additional unconventional tools to spur inflation and growth in the euro zone.
Speaking to the economic and monetary affairs committee of the European parliament, Draghi said the euro zone central bank's Governing Council "remains fully determined to counter risks to the medium-term outlook for inflation".
Demand was lower than expected last week for the ECB's first offering of new long-term loans to banks, part of a stimulus programme aimed at increasing lending to companies within the euro zone. That heightened expectations the ECB will eventually have to undertake asset purchases with new money, the process called quantitative easing.

Internet rumors spread by a surfing website about a 2015 VW Bus are wrong; no Bus is coming.

Don't believe everything you see on the web. Volkswagen is not poised to introduce a new version of its legendary microbus.

A spate of rumors and even a set of photos sprang up on the Internet this week, featuring stats, specs and details on the 2015 version of the German automakers leisure ride.
The website We Are Surfers said the new vehicle would be available with both four- and five-cylinder engines, and even had the MSRP ($25,000) and showroom date (early 2015).
It’s been called a lot of things in a lot of places--the Transporter, Microbus, Camper, Hippie Van, Bulli, Kombi, Breadloaf (by far the most evocative)—but the design of Volkswagen’s Type 2 is known around the world for its versatile but unsafe design.  And today marks...

This joins an earlier series of stories, including one in AutoWeek from May of this year, saying the vehicle known around the world as the Kombi, and in England as the Camper, was on its way back, though perhaps not for several more years.
A 2010 Car and Driver story said the van would be unveiled in 2013, and go into production in 2014.
But Volkswagen says there's no such vehicle.
"This rumor has been floating around the Internet for a while and it just isn’t true," said a company spokesperson.

The Man Making Bill Gates RicherSomeone's looking out for his money
Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images
This article originally appeared in Business Insider.
Bill Gates is worth an astounding $81.6 billion and he keeps getting richer every year. His secret weapon is a man you have probably never heard of: Michael Larson.  Gates hired Larson 20 years ago, when his net worth was a relatively paltry $5 billion, Anupreeta Das and Craig Karmin report in a profile on the notoriously secretive Larson at the  Wall Street Journal .  Larson runs Gates' personal investment company Cascade Investment LLC, funded solely by Gates.
Advertisement
At one time, Gates wealth depended solely on Microsoft. But for years he's been selling off his Microsoft stake. The common perception is that he's been using the proceeds from those sales directly for charity. That's not entirely how it works.  Although Gates makes his own investments in tech, it is Larson, though Cascade, who has taken Gate's money and diversified it. Gates now has vast holdings in real estate and non-tech companies like the Canadian National Railway Co., AutoNation Inc., and Republic Services Inc. It is these vast holdings that helps fund the Gates' donations.
And although Gates has given an astounding $38 billion to his charitable foundation , thanks to Larson, he's getting richer faster than he give his money away. His $81.6 billion is nearly $6 billion more than it was as of March 2014, when he was  worth $76 billion,  we reported at the time. And $76 billion was $9 billion more than he was worth in March, 2013.
In February, Gates celebrated 20 years of this partnership by throwing a gala to honor Larson at his Seattle mansion, reports the WSJ. It was a rare occasion where the two men socialized with each other. Apparently, they aren't buddies and don't hang out much, sources told the Journal.
At the party, Gates told guests that he has "complete trust and faith" in Larson, meaning that Larson invests Gates' money, buying and selling, with completely autonomy.
And he does it all under a cover of such ferocious secrecy that he's been nicknamed "the Gateskeeper."
Although publicly traded companies do reveal when Cascade has invested heavily in them, Larson has all sorts of tricks for keeping Cascade and Bill Gates' name out of other investments, sources told the Journal.
For instance, he makes employees sign confidentiality agreements which cover them even after they leave. He farms out more than $10 billion to up to 25 outside money managers. This helps him find new investment ideas, but it also helps cover the trail. When Cascade was part of an investment group that bought the Ritz-Carlton hotel in San Francisco, the publicist didn't even know Cascade, and Bill Gates, was among them.
He's also been known to fire up a limited Limited Liability Corporation to make real estate purchases, to keep Cascade's name off the deal and the deed.
He's so good at hiding the trail that most people don't know that Gates, through Cascade, owns a significant stake in the Four Seasons luxury-hotel chain.
And he's frugal with the boss's money, too. Apparently Cascade employees, of which there are about 100, are not allowed to stay at the Four Seasons when traveling on business, even if that business is on behalf of the Four Seasons.  They must choose a lower-cost, less luxurious hotel.
"Melinda and I are free to pursue our vision of a healthier and better-educated world because of what Michael has done," Gates told guests at the party.
And ultimately, the money will go to charity. Bill and Melinda Gates have vowed to donate 95 percent of their wealth to their foundation, as part of Gates' Giving Pledge.
But until then, Larson is making it grow.

"When I started off 50 years ago, the term entrepreneur didn't exist," Branson said in the competition's launch video. "The idea of rolling up your sleeves and creating things was seen as a slightly dirty word. The truth is what entrepreneurs are doing is making the world a better place."
Each winner of the competition will be flown in a private jet to spend five days with Branson along with other mentors including FUBU founder Daymond John, The 4-Hour Work Week author Tim Ferriss, and MarieTV's Marie Forleo. Seth Godin, best known for Seth's Blog , will make an appearance to teach a seminar on the island.
Ferriss said it's important to support entrepreneurship as a way to add value to the economy.
"Entrepreneurs are creators," he said. "They create something from nothing; they are value-creators."
But it takes a special kind of entrepreneur to really make an impact, according to Branson.
"You're only going to succeed as an entrepreneur if you create something that makes people's lives better," he said. "I'm biased, but I think being an entrepreneur is a pretty damn good thing."
The eight-month competition rewards the entrepreneurs that bring in the most sales during a two-month period.
Competitions have long inspired entrepreneurship and innovation. From the Latitude Prize in 1714, which awarded £20,000 to whomever could pinpoint a ship's location at sea, to the Daily Mail's £10,000 prize announced in 1913 to the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean by plane.
Last year's Build A Business competition included 21,000 contestants who brought in more than $120 million in revenues. The winners received a cash prize and a trip to NYC to meet industry experts, including Huffington Post's Arianna Huffington.
Amy Crouse, the founder of Colorado-based Bolder Bands, is one of last year's winners.
"It's a risk to step out there and share your product, but at the same time, the rewards far outweigh that risk, and I'm so glad that my husband and I took that step," she said.
Bolder Bands, which sells athletic headbands, says it's on track to be in 1,000 retailers by the end of this year.
Necker Island, located in the British Virgin Islands, is home to wildlife including a flock of 200 flamingos.
To enter, contestants need to launch a store and sell a product on Shopify. Businesses must not have had any sales prior to June 1, 2014. The shop's best two months of sales will be calculated to determine the winners when the competition closes on May 31, 2015.

Why Suzlon Energy Shares Crashed 20% in Two Days
NDTV | Updated On: September 22, 2014 12:26 (IST)
The Week Ahead: Nifty All Set to Conquer 8,500 Peak
Shares in Suzlon Energy fell by their maximum daily limit for second consecutive day on Monday. In last two trading sessions Suzlon Energy shares have fallen over 20 per cent.
The sharp selloff was triggered on Friday, when the shares allotted by the company to foreign currency convertible bond holders got listed on the exchange on September 19, 2014.
Suzlon Energy had issued 270 million equity shares at Rs 15.46 per share to FCCB holders under a restructuring arrangement.
According to the arrangement, FCCBs issued earlier - including unpaid interest and default interest - were converted into equity shares. The conversion of FCCBs to equity shares resulted in dilution of promoter holding from 37.81 per cent to 34.46 per cent.
Analysts say new shareholders have been selling their shares in the open market because the issue price was substantially less than current market price.
As of 10.32 a.m. shares in Suzlon Energy were locked in lower circuit at Rs 18.35 on National Stock Exchange.

Mumbai: The Nifty rose modestly on Monday to notch its fourth consecutive session of gains, led by blue chips that have under-performed recently such as Tata Motors and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), although the mood was broadly cautious.
Shares could be vulnerable ahead of the expiry of monthly derivatives contract on Thursday, while Asian shares skidded as investors awaited the preliminary reading of a private survey of manufacturing in China due on Tuesday
Investors are also expected to remain cautious ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's policy review on September 30. Although the apex bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, markets will focus on the tone of its statement.
"We are in a bull market and buyers are still emerging on every levels. However, you have to remain cautious about valuation and the risk as markets are near record highs," said Daljeet S Kohli, head of research at IndiaNivesh.
The benchmark BSE Sensex closed 0.43 per cent higher at 27,206.74, after ending down 0.08 per cent on Friday.
The broader Nifty ended 0.31 per cent higher at 8,146.30.

Education With a Debt SentenceCross-posted with TomDispatch.com
Imagine corporations that intentionally target low-income single  mothers as ideal customers. Imagine that these same companies claim to  sell tickets to the American dream -- gainful employment, the chance for  a middle class life. Imagine that the fine print on these tickets, once  purchased, reveals them to be little more than debt contracts,  profitable to the corporation’s investors, but disastrous for its  customers. And imagine that these corporations receive tens of billions  of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to do this dirty work. Now, know that  these corporations actually exist and are universities.
Over the last three decades, the price of a year of college has increased by more than 1,200% .  In the past, American higher education has always been associated with  upward mobility, but with student loan debt quadrupling between 2003 and  2013, it’s time to ask whether education alone can really move people  up the class ladder. This is a question of obvious relevance for  low-income students and students of color.
As Cornell professor Noliwe Rooks and journalist Kai Wright have reported, black college enrollment has increased at nearly twice the rate of white enrollment in recent years, but a disproportionate number of those African-American students end up at for-profit schools. In 2011, two of those institutions, the University of Phoenix (with physical campuses in 39 states and massive online programs) and the online-only Ashford University, produced more black graduates than any other institutes of higher education in the country. Unfortunately, a recent survey by economist Rajeev Darolia shows that for-profit graduates fare little better on the job market than job seekers with high school degrees; their diplomas, that is, are a net loss, offering essentially the same grim job prospects as if they had never gone to college, plus a lifetime debt sentence.
Many students who enroll in such colleges don’t realize that there is a difference between for-profit, public, and private non-profit institutions of higher learning. All three are concerned with generating revenue, but only the for-profit model exists primarily to enrich its owners. The largest of these institutions are often publicly traded, nationally franchised corporations legally beholden to maximize profit for their shareholders before maximizing education for their students. While commercial vocational programs have existed since the nineteenth century, for-profit colleges in their current form are a relatively new phenomenon that began to boom with a series of initial public offerings in the 1990s, followed quickly by deregulation of the sector as the millennium approached. Bush administration legislation then weakened government oversight of such schools, while expanding their access to federal financial aid, making the industry irresistible to Wall Street investors.
While the for-profit business model has generally served investors well, it has failed students. Retention rates are abysmal and tuitions sky-high. For-profit colleges can be up to twice as expensive as Ivy League universities, and routinely cost five or six times the price of a community college education. The Medical Assistant program at for-profit Heald College in Fresno, California, costs $22,275. A comparable program at Fresno City College costs $1,650. An associate degree in paralegal studies at Everest College in Ontario, California, costs $41,149, compared to $2,392 for the same degree at Santa Ana College, a mere 30-minute drive away.
Exorbitant tuition means students, who tend to come from poor backgrounds, have to borrow from both the government and private sources, including Sallie Mae (the country's largest originator, servicer, and collector of student loans) and banks like Chase and Wells Fargo. A whopping 96% of students who manage to graduate from for-profits leave owing money, and they typically carry twice the debt load of students from more traditional schools.
Public funds in the form of federal student loans has been called the “lifeblood” of the for-profit system, providing on average 86% of revenues. Such schools now enroll around 10% of America’s college students, but take in more than a quarter of all federal financial aid -- as much as $33 billion in a single year. By some estimates it would cost less than half that amount to directly fund free higher education at all currently existing two- and four-year public colleges. In other words, for-profit schools represent not a “market solution” to increasing demand for the college experience, but the equivalent of a taxpayer-subsidized subprime education.
Pushing the Hot Button, Poking the Pain
The mantra is everywhere: a college education is the only way to climb out of poverty and create a better life. For-profit schools allow Wall Street investors and corporate executives to cash in on this faith.
Publicly traded schools have been shown to have profit margins, on average, of nearly 20%. A significant portion of these taxpayer-sourced proceeds are spent on Washington lobbyists to keep regulations weak and federal money pouring in. Meanwhile, these debt factories pay their chief executive officers $7.3 million in average yearly compensation. John Sperling, architect of the for-profit model and founder of the University of Phoenix, which serves more students than the entire University of California system or all the Ivy Leagues combined, died a billionaire in August.
Graduates of for-profit schools generally do not fare well. Indeed, they rarely find themselves in the kind of work they were promised when they enrolled, the kind of work that might enable them to repay their debts, let alone purchase the commodity-cornerstones of the American dream like a car or a home.
In the documentary " College Inc. ," produced by PBS’s investigative series Frontline, three young women recount how they enrolled in a nursing program at Everest College on the promise of $25-$35 an hour jobs on graduation. Course work, however, turned out to consist of visits to the Museum of Scientology to study “psychiatrics” and visits to a daycare center for their “pediatrics rotation.” They each paid nearly $30,000 for a 12-month program, only to find themselves unemployable because they had been taught nearly nothing about their chosen field.
In 2010, an undercover investigation by the Government Accountability Office tested 15 for-profit colleges and found that every one of them “made deceptive or otherwise questionable statements” to undercover applicants. These recruiting practices are now under increasing scrutiny from 20 state attorneys general, Senate investigators, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), amid allegations that many of these schools manipulate the job placement statistics of their graduates in the most cynical of ways.
The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, an organization that offers support in health, education, employment, and community-building to new veterans, put it this way in August 2013: "Using high-pressure sales tactics and false promises, these institutions lure veterans into enrolling into expensive programs, drain their post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits, and sign up for tens of thousands of dollars in loans. The for-profits take in the money but leave the students with a substandard education, heavy student loan debt, non-transferable credits, worthless degrees, or no degrees at all.”
Even President Obama has spoken out against instances where for-profit colleges preyed upon troops with brain damage: “These Marines had injuries so severe some of them couldn’t recall what courses the recruiter had signed them up for.”
As it happens, recruiters for such schools are manipulating more than statistics. They are mining the intersections of class, race, gender, inequality, insecurity, and shame to hook students. "Create a sense of urgency. Push their hot button. Don't let the student off the phone. Dial, dial, dial," a director of admissions at Argosy University, which operates in 23 states and online, told his enrollment counselors in an internal email.
A training manual for recruiters at ITT Tech, another multi-state and virtual behemoth, instructed its employees to "poke the pain a bit and remind them who else is depending on them and their commitment to a better future.”  It even included a " pain funnel " -- that is, a visual guide to help recruiters exploit prospective students’ vulnerabilities. Pain was similarly a theme at Ashford University, where enrollment advisors were told by their superiors to “dig deep” into students’ suffering to “convince them that a college degree is going to solve all their problems.”
An internal document from Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (owner of Everest, Heald, and Wyotech colleges) specified that its target demographic is “isolated,” “impatient” individuals with “low self-esteem.”  They should have “few people in their lives who care about them and be stuck in their lives, unable to imagine a future or plan well.”
These recruiting strategies are as well funded as they are abhorrent. When an institution of higher learning is driven primarily by the needs of its shareholders, not its students, the drive to get “ asses in classes ” guarantees that marketing budgets will dwarf whatever is spent on faculty and instruction. According to David Halperin, author of Stealing America’s Future : How For-Profit Colleges Scam Taxpayers and Ruin Student’s Lives, “The University of Phoenix has spent as much as $600 million a year on advertising; it has regularly been Google’s largest advertiser, spending $200,000 a day.” 
At some schools, the money put into the actual education of a single student has been as low as $700 per year. The Senate’s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee revealed that 30 of the for-profit industry’s biggest players spent $4.2 billion -- or 22.7% of their revenue -- on recruiting and marketing in 2010.
Subprime Schools, Swindled Students
In profit paradise, there are nonetheless signs of trouble. Corinthian College Inc., for instance, is under investigation by several state and federal agencies for falsifying job-placement rates and lying to students in marketing materials. In June, the Department of Education discovered that the company was on the verge of collapse and began supervising a search for buyers for its more than 100 campuses and online operations. In this “unwinding process,” some Corinthian campuses have already shut down. To make matters worse, this month the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a $500 million lawsuit accusing Corinthian of running a “predatory lending scheme.”
As the failure of Corinthian unfolds, those who understood it to be a school -- namely, its students -- have been left in the lurch. Are their hard-earned degrees and credits worthless?  Should those who are enrolled stay put and hope for the storm to pass or jump ship to another institution? Social media reverberate with anxious questions.
Nathan Hornes started the Facebook group “Everest Avengers,” a forum where students who feel confused and betrayed can share information and organize. A 2014 graduate of Everest College’s Ontario, California, branch, Nathan graduated with a 3.9 GPA, a degree in Business Management, and $65,000 in debt. Unable to find the gainful employment Everest promised him, he currently works two fast-food restaurant jobs. Nathan’s dreams of starting a record label and a music camp for inner city kids will be deferred even further into some distant future when his debts come due: a six-month grace period expires in October and Nathan will owe $380 each month on Federal loans alone. “Do I want to pay bills or my loans?” he asks. Corinthian has already threatened to sue him if he fails to make payments.
Asked to explain Corinthian’s financial troubles, Trace Urdan, a market analyst for Wells Fargo Bank, Corinthian’s biggest equity investor, argued that the school attracts “ subprime students ” who “can be expected -- as a group -- to repay at levels far lower than most student loans.” And yet, as Corinthian’s financial woes mounted, the corporation stopped paying rent at its Los Angeles campuses and couldn’t pay its own substantial debts to lenders, including Bank of America, from whom it sought a debt waiver.
That Corinthian can request debt waivers from its lenders should give us pause. Who, one might ask, is the proper beneficiary of a debt waiver in this case? No such favors will be done for Nathan Hornes or other former Corinthian students, though they have effectively been led into a debt trap with an expert package of misrepresentations, emotional manipulation, and possibly fraud.
From Bad Apples to a Better System, or Everest Avenged
As is always the case with corporate scandals, Corinthian is now being described as a “ bad apple ” among for-profits, not evidence of a rotten orchard. The fact is that for-profits like Corinthian exemplify all the contradictions of the free-market model that reformers present as the only solution to the current crisis in higher education: not only are these schools 90% dependent on taxpayer money, but tenure doesn’t exist, there are no faculty unions, most courses are offered online with low overhead costs, and students are treated as “customers.”
It’s also worth remembering that at “public” universities, it is now nearly impossible for working class or even middle class students to graduate without debt. This sad state of affairs -- so the common version of the story goes -- is the consequence of economic hard-times, which require belt tightening and budget cuts. And so it has come to pass that strapped community colleges are now turning away would-be enrollees who wind up in the embrace of for-profits that proceed to squeeze every penny they can from them and the public purse as well. (All the while, of course, this same tale provides for-profits with a cover: they are offering a public service to a marginalized and needy population no one else will touch.)
The standard narrative that, in the face of shrinking tax revenues, public universities must relentlessly raise tuition rates turns out, however, to be full of holes. As political theorist Robert Meister points out, this version of the story ignores the complicity of university leaders in the process. Many of them were never passive victims of privatization; instead, they saw tuition, not taxpayer funding, as the superior and preferred form of revenue growth.
Beginning in the 1990s, universities, public and private, began working ever more closely with Wall Street, which meant using tuition payments not just as direct revenue but also as collateral for debt-financing. Consider the venerable but beleaguered University of California system: a 2012 report out of its Berkeley branch, “ Swapping Our Futures, ” shows that the whole system was losing $750,000 each month on interest-rate swaps -- a financial product that promised lower borrowing costs, but ended up draining the U.C. system of already-scarce resources.
In the last decade, its swap agreements have cost it over $55 million and could, in the end, add up to a loss of $200 million. Financiers, as the university’s creditors, are promised ever-increasing tuition as the collateral on loans, forcing public schools to aggressively recruit ever more out-of-state students, who pay higher tuitions, and to raise the in-state tuition relentlessly as well, simply to meet debt burdens and keep credit ratings high.
Instead of being the social and economic leveler many believe it to be, American higher education in the twenty-first century too often compounds the problem of inequality through debt-servitude. Referring to student debt, which has by now reached $1.2 trillion , Meister suggests, “Add up the lifetime debt service that former students will pay on $1 trillion, over and above the principal they borrow, and you could run a very good public university system for what we are paying capital markets to fund an ever-worsening one."
You Are Not a Loan
The big problem of how we finance education won’t be solved overnight. But one group is attempting to provide both immediate aid to students like Nathan Hornes and a vision for rethinking debt as a systemic issue. On September 17th, the Rolling Jubilee , an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street, announced the abolition of a portfolio of debt worth nearly $4 million originating from for-profit Everest College. This granted nearly 3,000 former students no-strings-attached debt relief.
The authors of this article have both been part of this effort. To date, the Rolling Jubilee has abolished nearly $20 million dollars of medical and educational debt by taking advantage of a little-known trade secret: debt is often sold to debt collectors for mere pennies on the dollar. A medical bill that was originally $1,000 might sell to a debt collector for 4% of its sticker price, or $40. This allowed the Rolling Jubilee project to make a multi-million dollar impact with a budget of approximately $700,000 raised in large part through small individual donations.
The point of the Rolling Jubilee is simple enough: we believe people shouldn’t have to go into debt for basic needs. For the last four decades, easy access to credit has masked stagnating wages and crumbling social services, forcing many Americans to debt-finance necessities like college, health care, and housing, while the creditor class has reaped enormous rewards. But while we mean the Jubilee’s acts to be significant, we know it is not a sustainable solution to the problem at hand. There is no way to buy and abolish all the odious debt sloshing around our economy, nor would we want to. Given the way our economy is structured, people would start slipping into the red again the minute their debts were wiped out.
The Rolling Jubilee instead raises a question: If a ragtag group of activists can find a way to provide immediate relief to even a few thousand defrauded students, why can’t the government?
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s lawsuit against Corinthian Colleges, Inc. is a good first step, but it only applies to specific private loans originating after 2011, and it will likely take years to play out. Until it's resolved, students are still technically on the hook and many will be harassed by unscrupulous debt collectors attempting to extract money from them while they still can. In the meantime, the Department of Education (DOE) -- which has far greater purview than the CFPB -- is effectively acting as a debt collector for a predatory lender, instead of using its discretionary power to help students. Why didn’t the DOE simply let Corinthian go bankrupt, as often happens to private institutions, and so let the students’ debts become dischargeable?
Such debt discharge is well within the DOE’s statutory powers. When a school under its jurisdiction has broken state laws or committed fraud it is, in fact, mandated to offer debt discharge to students. Yet in Corinthian’s opaque, unaccountable unwinding process, the Department of Education appears to be focused on keeping as many of these predatory “schools” open as possible.
No less troubling, the DOE actually stands to profit off Corinthian’s debt payments, as it does from all federally secured educational loans, regardless of the school they are associated with. Senator Elizabeth Warren has already sounded the alarm about the department’s conflict of interest when it comes to student debt, citing an estimate that the government stands to rake in up to $51 billion dollars in a single year on student loans. As Warren points out, it’s “ obscene ” for the government to treat education as a profit center.
Can there be any doubt that funds reaped from the repayment of federally backed loans by Corinthian students are especially ill-gotten gains? Nathan Hornes and his fellow students should be the beneficiaries of debt relief, not further dispossession.
Unless people agitate, no reprieve will be offered. Instead there may be slaps on the wrist for a few for-profit “bad apples,” with policymakers presenting possible small reductions in interest rates or income-based payments for student borrowers as major breakthroughs.
We need to think bigger. There is an old banking adage: if you owe the bank $1,000, the bank owns you; if you owe the bank $1 million, you own the bank. Individually, student debt is an incapacitating burden. But as Nathan and others are discovering, as a premise for collective action, it can offer a new kind of leverage. Debt collectives, effectively debtors’ unions, may be the next stage of anti-austerity organizing. Collective action offers many possibilities for building power against creditors through collective bargaining, including the power to threaten a debt strike. Where for-profits prey on people’s vulnerability, isolation, and shame, debt collectives would nurture feelings of strength, solidarity, and outrage.
Those who profit from education fear such a transformation, and understandably so. “We ask students to make payments while in school to help them develop the discipline and practice of repaying their federal and other loan obligations,” a Corinthian Colleges spokesman said in response to the news of CFPB’s lawsuit.
It’s absurd: a single mother working two jobs and attending online classes to better her life is discipline personified, even if she can’t always pay her loans on time. The executives and investors living large off her financial aid are the ones who need to be taught a lesson. Perhaps we should collectively demand that as part of their punishment these predators take a course in self-discipline taught by their former students.

Rupee Ends Little Changed at 60.81You are here: Home Market
Rupee Ends Little Changed at 60.81
Reuters | Updated On: September 22, 2014 19:26 (IST)
The rupee ended little changed on Monday after gaining in each of the previous four sessions as investors turned more cautious a day before a preliminary survey on China's manufacturing sector.
The partially convertible rupee ended at 60.8150/8250 per dollar, compared with its close of 60.81/82 on Friday.
Worries about the health of China's economy have been a major drag in emerging market assets over the past week, while uncertainty also remains about the US Federal Reserve's near-zero interest rate policy.
Meanwhile, the rupee is also likely to remain range-bound ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's policy review on Sept. 30. Although the RBI is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, markets will focus on the tone of its statement.
"Rupee should be range-bound, given that we are seeing inflows and state-owned banks are buying (dollars) in the market," said Ashtosh Raina, head of foreign exchange trading at HDFC Bank.
Raina expects the rupee in a 60.50 to 61.50 range in the near term.
Dollar sales by custodians were offset by greenback purchases by public sector banks, keeping the rupee in a range, according to traders.
Traders said foreign fund flows will also be a key for the rupee ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's policy review.
Foreign funds have bought debt and equity worth nearly $3.62 billion so far in September, as per regulatory data, bringing their total for the year to $33.65 billion.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.13/18 while the three-month contract was at 61.66/76.

Xi Jinping demands  absolute loyalty  from PLAChinese President Xi Jinping demands 'absolute loyalty' from PLA

(Xi's directives come in…)
BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping today demanded "absolute loyalty" from PLA's top brass, asking them to repose "firm faith" in the ruling Communist Party, guarantee a smooth chain of command and make sure all decisions are implemented.
"Headquarters of PLA forces must have absolute loyalty and firm faith in the Communist Party of China, guarantee a smooth chain of command and make sure all decisions from the central leadership are fully implemented," said Xi, chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
"Headquarters of all People's Liberation Army (PLA) forces should improve their combat readiness and sharpen their ability to win a regional war in the age of information technology," Xi, who returned from India last week after a three-day visit, was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.
All PLA forces should follow the instructions of President Xi and update their operations to meet new goals and missions set by the CMC, an official statement said.
It is not yet clear why the emphasis was made on absolute loyalty and to follow the orders to ensure smooth chain of command.
Xi's directives come in the midst of a standoff between the PLA and Indian troops in Chumar area in Ladakh region along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).
The standoff took a new turn yesterday with the PLA pitching seven tents well within the Indian territory and showing no signs of withdrawing from the territory.
Xi, 61, acquired the image of China's most powerful leader after Deng Xiaoping, who succeeded Mao, as he headed the Presidency, the CPC and the military from day one of coming to power unlike his predecessor Hu Jintao .
Since then, Xi has reshuffled the military postings of the generals loyal to him at the top and removed and prosecuted some top PLA generals for corruption.
Yesterday, General Fang Fenghui , PLA chief, said in a statement that all PLA forces follow the instructions of President Xi who is also the chairman of the CMC, which is the overall high command of the Chinese military.
Fang said the forces should update their operations to meet new goals and missions set by the CMC.
Meanwhile, the PLA chiefs of staff met in Beijing to discuss how to improve the efficiency of military command under new circumstances. Fang attended the meeting.
Military commanders should have a better understanding of international and domestic security situations as well as the latest military development, Xi said.
They should also strictly discipline themselves and the armies as well as contribute to the reform of national defence, he said.
At Sunday's meeting, PLA chiefs of staff focused on streamlining the operational headquarters of all PLA forces with information technology and revised several important protocols, according to a statement.

The World s Leaders Are Failing To Curb Corruption. Here s Whyreddit
Rogue current and former dictators and global bribe-paying giant corporations are enjoying levels of impunity, placing them seemingly above the law, which only encourage international corruption and money laundering. The Group of 20 -- the forum of the leaders of the world's most powerful economies -- meets at summit level in November and needs to use this event to forcefully declare "NO IMPUNITY."
It is encouraging that the G20 is gradually moving in this direction. In this context, actions were agreed in advance of the meeting of finance ministers of the Group of 20 in Australia on September 19 and 20 to end the tax practices of companies like Apple , Amazon and Starbucks
that evaded high rates in countries where they have huge markets by registering their businesses in low business tax countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. These tax approaches have been legal, but they prompted public outrage . The politicians felt the heat and have started to take measures.
But, the G20 needs to go much further. It should build on its anti-tax avoidance initiative to take on the crooks by strengthening the G20's existing "Anti-Corruption Action Plan ." President Obama and the other world leaders, when they hold their summit on November 15 in Brisbane, Australia, should focus on the grand corruption that involves vast sums being stolen, ultimately, from citizens across the world.
Let us just look at a few of the major cases that need to be addressed, from the plunder by the current ruler of Sudan, to the vast theft by the former president of Ukraine, to the activities of one of the world's biggest banks, as well as possibly vast international bribe-paying by the world's biggest retail corporation. These cases are just the tip of the iceberg of political and corporate corruption that demands G20 action.
Example: BNP Paribas , France's largest bank. In early July it pleaded guilty to U.S. Justice Department charges and paid a $8.9 billion fine (the largest ever for money laundering) for violating U.S. sanctions on Sudan, Cuba and Iran. The Justice Department stated that the bank had taken deposits over many years from these countries into its Geneva office and then changed the identities of the account holders so that they could illegally acquire U.S. dollar investments.
The charges indicated that billions of dollars were laundered for Sudan and that means the accounts of Sudan's dictator Omar al-Bashir and his cronies. Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court for massive human rights crimes directly related to the slaughter of thousands of people in Dafur.
Several years ago, Wikileaks, according to The Guardian newspaper, revealed that the Sudanese leader had "siphoned as much as $9 billion out of his impoverished country, and much of it may be stashed in London banks."
There is no evidence that U.K. authorities have investigated these allegations. There is no evidence that BNP Paribas is no longer serving as Sudan's banker or that the French authorities care. No top banker at BNP, or, for that matter, any of the major banks caught by the U.S. Justice Department for money laundering and sanctions violations, have been hauled into court and prosecuted.
Example: former Ukraine president Viktor Yanukovych. Ukrainians where aghast when Yanukovych was forced out of office in February to see the incredible riches of his gold-plated mansion in Kiev. Politicians claimed he had stolen at least $20 billion and perhaps double or triple that sum. Immediately, Swiss and Austrian authorities announced they were blocking bank accounts in their countries belonging to the dictator. In June, the Ukraine authorities announced they were investigating the links of two domestic banks to the former leader.
However, the Austrian and Swiss authorities have not revealed which banks held the stolen cash or how large the assets are that are frozen and whether they will be returning the money to the people of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the dictator or his cronies who have the foreign assets, which were almost certainly laundered through holding companies in countries like Cyprus, Liechtenstein and the Cayman Islands to hide the real owners of the accounts, have been pressured to reveal where the stolen money is.
The vast funds stolen by corrupt leaders, like Yanukovych, or the former dictators of Egypt (President Mubarek) and Tunisia (President Ben-Ami) have not been seized by Western authorities and returned to their rightful owners -- the citizens of their countries. The G20 needs to act to close the money laundering havens and ensure asset repatriation.
Example: Walmart, the world's largest retailer. In March, the company announced that over the previous two years it had spent $439 million conducting internal investigations of bribing foreign government officials in Mexico, China, India and Brazil. It was not the U.S. Justice Department that prompted Walmart to become alarmed. It was an investigation the New York Times in 2012.
There are many other cases of international corruption where the justice departments of G20 governments have either turned a blind eye or done very little. Challenging this complacency is a brand new global campaign launched by the anti-corruption organization, Transparency International, which is called: " Unmask the Corrupt ." It seeks to expose the corrupt villains -- individuals and corporations -- as well as the schemes they use to launder their cash and, as a result, buy yachts harbored in the South of France, mansions in London, Manhattan and Beverly Hills and the world's most valuable works of art.
It is now time for the G20 to do some unmasking. It needs to use its summit meeting and put an end to the impunity that is so widespread.

During Open Enrollment  Three Ways to Save On Health InsuranceIt's open enrollment! Here's three ways to save on health insurance

It's open enrollment season, a short period of time when companies offer employees the opportunity to make changes to their health insurance and other benefits for the next year. In some cases, your choices this fall could potentially save you hundreds of dollars in 2015.
But you have to take action right now.
Workplace benefits can be complex and confusing to navigate for the nearly 150 million Americans are covered under employer-sponsored health plans. Yet, taking time to ensure that the plan you selected last year is still appropriate for you and your family can potentially save you hundreds of dollars. If you or your dependents have had a change in their health status, you need to consider the out-of-pocket costs and possibly change your plan.
"Determine if you and any dependents on your plan are a high health-care user or low health-care user," said physician and certified financial planner Carolyn McClanahan of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. "Do you visit the doctor only if you're so sick you have to be taken by an ambulance or do you frequent your practitioner every time you get a cough? If you go to the doctor a lot or have a lot of prescriptions, then most likely a lower deductible plan (with higher premiums) is a better option for you. If you rarely go, then likely a high deductible plan (with lower premiums) will be the best option."
Here are three strategies to help you save a little more on health-care costs:
1. Get a discount or bonus with health-care incentives.
Check if your employer is offering any cash incentives for taking extra steps towards your health, such as filling out a health questionnaire, taking a biometric screening, or certifying that you are a non-tobacco user,  said Tracy Watts, a Washington, D.C.-based senior partner at the global consulting firm Mercer.
There are also additional charges to keep in mind. Some employers have a spousal surcharge. So if your spouse has access through his or her employer and they choose not to take it and go on your insurance instead, your employer may charge you extra. Having separate plans could save you money.
2. Carry over $500 in a Flexible Spending Account to next year.
A Flexible Spending Account (FSA) allows you to contribute money from your paycheck to a special fund that can be used for eligible heath-care expenses. Your contributions are made pre-tax, which saves you money, and can be used for medical expenses and dependent care, including child-care costs. Some employees have been wary of FSAs since unused funds generally expire.
But there's been a change to the "use it or lose it" rule: Many employers now offer the ability to carry over $500 of unused FSA money into the next year.
3. Put away money in a Health Savings Account for now, or later.
A Health Savings Account (HSA) is for people enrolled in high-deductible health plans. Contributions are also made pre-tax and what you don't use in a given year will carry over to the next plan year. You can even take your HSA with you when you change jobs. The maximum contribution in 2015 for an HSA is $3,350 for individuals and $6,650 for families. Catch-up contributions for those age 55 or older are $1,000.
You can have an HSA even if your employer doesn't offer one. The only caveat is that you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan.
"If you've done that, anyone can open an account with a bank or broker. Plus it has a triple tax advantage," Watts said.
You don't pay taxes on the money going into an HSA, funds grow on tax-deferred, and you can use the money tax-free to pay for qualified medical expenses.

NIA seeks MHA nod to register case against ISIS  al Qaeda for hiring IndianyouthsPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 8:45 pm | Updated: September 23, 2014 1:57 am
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has sought the permission of the Ministry of Home Affairs to file a case against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
Following reports of Indian youths joining ISIS, the NIA is said to have suggested that an “open case” under provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and the UN Convention on terrorism could be filed against ISIS for brainwashing youths into committing acts of terror.
“We are still deliberating the specific sections under which the case would be registered. The Home Ministry is to take a final call on it,” a senior NIA official said.

Since the group has not committed any crime in India, the Home Ministry is exploring the possibility of registering the case under some preparatory sections, such as Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.
The section states: “Whoever conspires or attempts to commit, or advocates, abets, advises or incites or knowingly facilitates the commission of a terrorist act or any act preparatory to the commission of a terrorist act, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.”
Four men from Kalyan in Maharashtra had left to fight for the ISIS in June this year. One of them was reportedly killed while fighting for the group in Iraq. The US Central Intelligence Agency has said that ISIS, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has 50,000 cadre operating out of Iraq and Syria.

BJP may contest all seats in Maha: Rajiv Pratap RudyAmit Shah
("In a contingent situation…)
NEW DELHI: Not relenting on seat sharing in Maharashtra , BJP today said it would fight in all the 288 assembly seats if it is "compelled" to part ways with Shiv Sena, its ally of 25 years.
The statement from Rajiv Pratap Rudy , BJP's General Secretary in charge of Maharashtra, came on a day when impasse over seat-sharing between both parties persisted with BJP leaders charging Sena with making no concrete offers but just talking of a seat-sharing formula through TV channels.
"In a contingent situation that the BJP is compelled not to contest with Shiv Sena, we would go it alone on all 288 seats but we will prefer that Shiv Sena comes along," Rudy told reporters.
Party sources said they have prepared a list of candidates for a majority of seats barring "20-30" where they were still looking for appropriate names or expecting leaders from other parties to join them.
"We are not in favour of breaking the alliance. But we are also not in a mood of tolerating their (Sena) uncompromising attitude. There can be flexibility but we are getting to hear their proposals only on news channels," a BJP leader said.
Thackeray had made it clear in Mumbai yesterday that his final offer to BJP was 119 seats while Sena will fight 151 seats, leaving 18 for smaller allies. BJP, which had said both parties fight 135 seats each, had rejected the proposal.
BJP is also cold to the idea of projecting Thackeray as the chief ministerial candidate of the alliance.
There were reports that BJP President Amit Shah spoke to Thackeray today and urged him to reconsider his stand on seat-sharing. But party leaders declined to confirm that Shah made any such call even as they said "messengers" of top leaders of both parties are in touch.
Shah is believed to have spoken to Thackeray yesterday when the party held its Central Election Committee and Parliamentary Board meeting.
Both the meetings, which had gone on for over three hours, were attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah, both of whom spent some time together separately, and other leaders.
Later, Rudy told reporters that BJP was willing to contest 130 seats, five less than its earlier claim of 135 constituencies.
He said they have sent "a very liberal proposal" to Sena as the 130 seats include the "worst" possible seats which its ally had never won in last 30 years.
"The fact is that the proposal which has been given and conversation which has taken place with BJP President (Amit Shah).... a very liberal proposal has been sent to Shiv Sena.
"The other seats which we are demanding are those which Sena has never won in last 30 years. We have said... give us the worst possible seats but give us the numbers," he told reporters today.
Though this is the first time BJP has officially come down on its demand but its leaders had been conveying to Sena leadership that they were willing to settle around 130 seats, a demand it has rejected so far.

As BJP today sent a "very liberal proposal" to Shiv Sena seeking to contest 130 of Maharashtra's 288 Assembly seats, its saffron ally appeared in no mood to oblige, raising further the possibility of disintegration of the 25-year-old alliance . A top Maharashtra BJP leader and the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Eknath Khadse even went to the extent of saying the alliance was on the "death bed".
The deadlock has left smaller allies of 'Mahayuti', a mega-alliance led by Sena and BJP, restive with one of them threatening to walk out and contest the polls alone. A day after Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray talked tough and made a "final offer' under which his party would fight 151 seats, BJP 119 and allies the rest 18, BJP made a counter offer seeking 130, a climbdown from earlier 135, but said it would contest all 288 seats if "compelled" to part ways from its oldest ally in the NDA.
Though no Shiv Sena leader was prepared to go on record about the party's response to BJP's proposal, a party MP, speaking on condition of anonymity, said "the proposal is old. Uddhav Thackeray has made it clear that his offer is final." BJP General Secretary in charge of Maharashtra Rajiv Pratap Rudy said in Delhi that his party has sent "a very liberal proposal" to Sena as the 130 seats include the "worst" possible seats which its ally had never won in last 30 years.
"The fact is that the proposal which has been given and conversation which has taken place with BJP President (Amit Shah).... a very liberal proposal has been sent to Shiv Sena. "The other seats which we are demanding are those which Sena has never won in last 30 years. We have said... give us the worst possible seats but give us the numbers," he he said.

"We are not in favour of breaking the alliance. But we are also not in a mood of tolerating their (Sena) uncompromising attitude. There can be flexibility but we are getting to hear their proposals only on news channels," a BJP leader said.
Khadse, one of the claimants for Chief Minister's post if BJP came to power, said the alliance was practically on the "death bed". "The eyes are not moving, so are hands and legs. Looks like its time for (last) preparations," he told a private Marathi TV channel. With no clarity yet on the fate of the alliance, two of Mahayuti's smaller constituents today asked Sena and BJP to resolve the seat-sharing tangle quicky, failing which they would "think of other options."
In separate media briefings, RPI president Ramadas Athawale and Rashtriya Samaj Party leader Mahadev Jankar said Sena and BJP should get their act together to prevent Congress-NCP combine from winning a fourth consecutive term in Maharashtra. "If the seat-sharing issue is not resolved tomorrow and if the alliance breaks, RSP will contest 125 seats on its own," Jankar said. Athawale said neither Sena nor BJP should take RPI for granted. "Don't take us for granted. Sort out the Mahayuti seat-sharing issue fast," he said.
"People want change. We should not betray them," he said, adding BJP should consider the formula put forth by Uddhav Thackeray. "NCP chief Sharad Pawar called me recently and made an offer that RPI could align with them if things don't go well in Mahayuti," Athawale said. Asked what would he do if Sena-BJP alliance breaks, Athawale said, "We have the option of going with either Sena or BJP or contesting on our own or we may even think of the other alternative (going with NCP)."

Draghi gets a grilling, defends cheap loan program

Draghi gets a grilling, defends cheap loan program
"The economic recovery in the euro areas is losing momentum," Draghi told the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. "The early information on economic conditions which we received over the summer has been somewhat weaker than expected."
Post your opinion here
 
The President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, stepped into the spotlight again on Monday, as he testified in front of European policymakers amid renewed concerns of deflation and questions regarding the effectiveness of his policies.
"The economic recovery in the euro areas is losing momentum," Draghi told the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. "The early information on economic conditions which we received over the summer has been somewhat weaker than expected."
He also defended the take-up of the ECB's latest cheap loan program, dubbed TLTRO or targeted longer-term refinancing operation. Last Thursday, the ECB doled out 82.6 billion euros ($106 billion) in loans to banks—an amount which was viewed as disappointingly low by markets.
Draghi insisted: "This is within the range of take-up values we had expected... By design, the September and December operations should be assessed in combination."
Another round of cheap loans will be offered in December.
Read More ECB doles out cheap loans to banks, fuels QE hopes
Draghi also defended Blackrock's role as an adviser on the ECB's purchasing program for covered bonds and ABS (asset-backed securities). The U.S. investment firm was active during the sub-prime crisis of 2007, when major banks collapsed after loading up on securities backed by mortgages which then defaulted in large volumes.
"We are using Blackrock to help us design our program, which is nothing strange at all," said Draghi. He added that the U.S. Federal Reserve had also hired investment management firms to advise them about QE.
"Their function is purely advisory," said Draghi. "We have been extremely careful about containing any conflict of interest."
'QE coming'
TLTROs and private asset purchases are some of a number of stimulus measures recently announced by Draghi that have left markets wanting more. This has led to a growing number of economists expecting the ECB to launch a Federal Reserve-style quantitative easing (QE) program.
On Monday, Draghi said the bank stood ready to use "further additional unconventional instruments" if necessary. He has stated his willingness to do so repeatedly, fueling hopes of QE.
A team of analysts at Barclays, led by Philippe Gudin, are now so sure the central bank will have to start buying up government bonds that they argue a QE program is the base-case scenario for the euro zone.
"Increasing the ECB's balance sheet by up to 1 trillion euros to its 2012 size is unlikely to be achieved via TLTROs, ABS (asset-backed securities) and covered bond purchases alone," the bank said in a research note on Friday. Barclays believes the new measure will most likely be implemented by the first quarter of 2015.

"Second, we believe that the risk of too long a period of low inflation is higher than the ECB's inflation projections imply, while the growth outlook has significantly deteriorated and remains subject mainly to downside risks, especially for France and Italy," the bank added.
Draghi reiterated on Monday that inflation would remain low for the rest of the year, before gradually increasing in 2015 and 2016.
Euro zone inflation remained worryingly low at 0.4 percent in August, amid growing fears that the region could be heading towards a period of deflation - where consumer prices start falling instead of rising. The ECB now forecasts inflation will come in at 0.6 percent this year and will not start accelerating until 2015. Barclays believes it will average 0.5 percent this year and 0.8 percent next year.
An economic indicator called the "five-year, five-year forward breakeven rate" plunged close to 2010-lows on Monday. This is used to gauge where markets think euro zone inflation will be at in the future, and is so closely watched that Draghi name-checked it ahead of cutting interest rates earlier this month.
Monday's reading of around 1.91 percent marks a fall below the level it reached in August, when the ECB was forced into action.
Yields spike?
Injecting liquidity into the economy by buying sovereign bonds would be a controversial move by the ECB, and is thought by many to be beyond the ECB's mandate.
Draghi has, for instance, conceded that the euro zone doesn't have the same capital markets as the U.S. does. It will also be difficult to gauge which sovereign bonds should be bought by the central bank, with concerns emanating from Germany that it could dangerously stoke inflation in the euro zone's stronger nations.
Read More Lagarde: Confident G-20 will reach growth target
"Sovereign debt QE is coming next," Claus Vistesen, the chief euro zone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note on Monday morning. Vistesen believes the catalyst for QE would be higher bond yields in peripheral Europe, rather than fears over prolonged low inflation.
This would arise, Vistesen said, if the periphery—which includes countries like Greece, Portugal and Italy—are "allowed" by the European Union and Germany to run larger fiscal deficits next year.

Officials found dozens of bodies during Sierra Leones Ebola lockdownBy Abby Ohlheiser September 22 Follow @abbyohlheiser
Officials sweeping the homes of Sierra Leone's residents during a three-day lockdown found nearly 100 corpses along with more than 50 people who are infected with the deadly Ebola virus -- cases that were previously unknown to those trying to fight the outbreak, according to the agency leading the country's Ebola response.
Speaking to Reuters, Emergency Operations Center head Stephen Gaojia called the lockdown a "huge success" after the three-day order for residents to remain in their homes was lifted in most of the country. A few areas are still awaiting the completion of the sweep, including parts of the capital city of Freetown. Citing their success, officials said they won't extend the lockdown's duration.
Gaojia said officials removed 92 bodies from homes as of Saturday evening, and identified 56 positive Ebola cases out of 123 people who sought testing during the lockdown. Thirty-one of the 123 tested negative for the virus, while the rest are still waiting for test results.
On Sunday, Gaojia estimated to AFP that the country could end up with as many as 150 new cases from the sweep. That poses a challenge for the country's Ebola response infrastructure, which is already overburdened. "We have an overflow of bodies which we still need to bury but this has been an everyday occurence since the Ebola outbreak," Gaojia said.

According to  Sierra Leone Health Minister Abubakarr Fofanah , officials reached 80 percent of the 1.5 million homes targeted by the campaign.
The lockdown cleared the normally busy streets of Freetown for three days as volunteers went door-to-door, looking for victims and informing residents about Ebola. It was a controversial move, one Sierra Leone's government said was necessary to help fight the outbreak in the country, among the three hardest-hit by the spread of Ebola.
More than 550 of the to 2,793 deaths counted by the World Health Organization so far were in Sierra Leone.
Critics of the lockdown, including Doctors Without Borders, warned that the lockdown would be ineffective in the long term because quarantines and lockdowns "end up driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers."
As the AFP noted, others questioned whether volunteers were giving the most effective advice on their sweeps.
On Monday, the WHO announced that the spread of Ebola in Nigeria and Senegal was "pretty much contained." The two countries were the least affected of the five caught in the Ebola epidemic plaguing West Africa.
The situation is much more stark in Liberia, whose health care system is so overburdened by Ebola cases that people are dying of otherwise preventable illnesses. As The Post reported , patients suffering from ailments like malaria, diarrhea, diabetes, and other treatable conditions are either unable -- or unwilling -- to get treatment.

(KTG is in the process of adding…)
MUMBAI: Kochi-based Kitex Garments (KTG) has rallied 20 per cent in trade after Motilal Oswal initiated coverage with a 'Buy' recommendation.
According to the brokerage, the company has diversified its clients mix from a single client in FY09 to five currently, reducing client concentration risk and improving margins.
KTG is in the process of adding some large clients in FY15 apart from deepening business with existing clients like Gerber, Toys R Us , Jockey, Mothercare and Carter's.
The company is in the business of manufacturing and exporting infant garments. It derives 85 per cent of its revenue from the sale of infant garments and the balance 15 per cent from the sale of fabric to Kitex Childrenwear.
"Going forward, KTG intends to improve its revenue mix in favor of high margin clients like Toys R Us, Jockey and Mothercare, who procure high value-added products which will drive continued margin improvement," the report said.
"We expect KTG to post 24.6 per cent revenue CAGR coupled with 700bp margin expansion over FY14-FY17E. Hence, we expect PAT to post 40 per cent CAGR over FY14-17E. With 60 per cent capacity utilization currently, we expect ramp-up of existing capacities and minimal expansion capex," the report said.

Gen Xers are poorer than their parentsGen Xers are poorer than their parents
By Tami Luhby   @Luhby September 22, 2014: 7:05 AM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Gen Xers may be taking home bigger paychecks than their parents did at the same age, but they haven't been able to accumulate nearly as much wealth.
The typical Gen Xer has only $29,100 in wealth, compared to the $65,200 that their parents had socked away at the same age, according to a new report from the Pew financial security and mobility project. Wealth includes savings, retirement funds, homes and other investments.
"They are on track to be the first in recent history to fall behind previous generations in terms of wealth accumulation, a key indicator of economic security and particularly retirement preparedness," Diana Elliott, research manager at Pew, said of this generation, born between 1965 and 1980. Researchers compared Gen Xers with their own parents.
Only 36% of Gen Xers have exceeded their parents' net worth. That's especially telling since three-quarters of Gen Xers are taking home bigger paychecks than their parents did.
 
Why are Gen Xers so much poorer? Debt, particularly student loans .
The Molly Ringwald/Kurt Cobain generation have nearly six times the debt levels of their parents, primarily from college. And this debt hampered Gen X's ability to accumulate wealth even two decades after they graduated.
That's not to say college isn't worth it. Degree-holding Gen Xers make $25,000 a year more than their non-educated peers. They also have $26,000 more in home equity and $9,000 more in other wealth, Pew found.
Related: Enough with Millennials. Here's what Gen X thinks
When it comes to mobility, Gen Xers are also a lot less likely to move up the economic ladder ... or fall from their perch. Nearly three-quarters of those raised at the bottom of the income ladder never reach the middle, while nearly 70% of those raised at the top never fall to the middle. That's linked to sharp demographic differences between the ends of income spectrum: Those at the bottom are often single and not college-educated, while those at the top are married with a degree.
Gen Xers are also less prepared for retirement , according to an earlier Pew study. They lost 45% of their savings between 2007 and 2010, and only have enough to replace about half of their pre-retirement income.
This lack of savings and wealth have the Pew researchers concerned.
"The findings show that Gen X has bigger hurdles to overcome than previous generations did to achieve financial security," Elliott said.

The 5 Best Places To Do Yoga In Your Officereddit
Don't assume there isn't enough space in your office for a regular yoga or meditation practice. My clients are often surprised by how easy it is to convert their daily workspace into a refuge for inner peace. As the founder of an office yoga company , I have taught yoga in virtually every possible space. Here are my top five most yoga-able office spaces.
Office lounge
In many new offices, especially at tech companies, there is desk-free space. Perhaps it's the section in the center of the office with couches. Maybe it's the room where the ping pong table lives. Even the kitchen/lunch room area can be used during off hours. Furniture in these spaces is easy to move, and a cheap divider or folding screens can be put up for added privacy if the space is open to the rest of the office.
Entryways, foyers
Though this space isn't ideal during business hours, the open entrance area of an office is perfect for yoga before the workday begins. If it's big enough, it can be used during after-work hours, as long as people aren't too distracted by their colleagues leaving the office. This is a good place to use a folding screen for added privacy.
Corners, perimeters around desks
Once again, this space isn't ideal during business hours. However, it can work when the office is empty. A yoga mat really doesn't take up much space, and you'll be pleasantly surprised by how little space seated meditation requires. Believe it or not, this space can work really well at the right time of day!
Conference rooms
Don't overlook the effectiveness of chair yoga. Often, a conference room can seat 20 or more people. A yoga or meditation session can be done here, allowing space for many participants. Bonus: People won't have to change clothing to do yoga in this kind of setting.
Your desk
Believe it or not, your desk can become a refuge! Try a short meditation or desk yoga pose at regular intervals during your work day. A solo practice is a powerful thing, and you will be amazed by how refreshing even one minute of meditation can be. Check out my blog about a fun one-minute meditation practice.
As you can see, office yoga is possible in your work space. Just look around and be creative. If your office has a budget for it, find a teacher who is experienced working in offices spaces. Soon, you'll be enjoying the benefits of a regular yoga practice !

CCI rejects unfair trade charges against 16 entities

The Competition Commission has rejected allegations of unfair trade practices made against 16 entities, including government and public sector enterprises, with regard to allocation of imported gold.
The complaints against Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, RBI and Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) and 12 government appointed agencies for import of gold have been rejected.
These agencies are MMTC Ltd, STC of India, PEC Ltd, Handicrafts and Handloom Exports Corporation of India, Nova Scotia, Kotak Mahindra Bank , IndusInd Bank , YES Bank , HDFC Bank , AXIS Bank , Punjab National Bank , State Bank of India .
It was alleged that the entities had abused their dominant market position by not enrolling and allocating the imported gold among jewellers and gold traders in a transparent and fair manner.
Also read: Gold imports seen up, premiums may double on festive buying
Finding no prima facie case of fair trade norms  violations, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), in an order released today said the entities were "not exclusively engaged in trading of gold, rather trading of gold is a part of their overall activities".
"It may be noted that trading of physical gold is not only done by these nominated agencies but also by the dealers, gold jewellery manufacturers and retailers whose activities are primarily confined to trading of gold," CCI said.
"Since, prima facie, none of the opposite parties appear to be in a dominant position in the relevant market, the question of abuse of dominant position by them under the...Act does not arise," it added.
Further, the Commission observed that there was "no information available on record to suggest any kind of agreement or collusion among the opposite parties in regards to allocation/distribution of imported gold which can be termed as anti-competitive".
The complaint filed by Sri Guru Jewels and Tushar had alleged that the government nominated agencies were either not enrolling applicants interested in allocation of imported gold or were enrolling them but not allocating the metal to them.
 As per RBI policy, nominated agencies are required to ensure that at least 20 per cent of every lot of imported gold is exclusively made available for the purpose of exports and the balance for domestic use against full upfront payment.
Further, the nominated agencies have to make available gold for domestic use only to entities engaged in jewellery business, bullion dealers supplying gold to jewellers and to banks authorised to administer 'Gold Deposit Scheme'.
The complainants had submitted with CCI that the agencies including banks had exclusive right to control the supply and distribution of imported gold among the jewellers and gold traders in the domestic market.
The jewellers and gold traders interested in imported gold are required to enrol themselves with the agencies which would then issue the metal against full upfront payment.

Adrian Peterson Has a Terrible Contract  and Cutting Him Would Save the Vikings a Lot of MoneyAdrian Peterson on the field in St. Louis, Missouri, on Sept. 7.
Photo by Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images
This article originally appeared in Business Insider .
The Minnesota Vikings reversed course last week and decided Wednesday  to bar Adrian Peterson from the team  until his legal issues are resolved. The Vikings put him on the exempt/commissioner's permission list — which will keep him under contract while barring him from team activities. It's basically a paid suspension.
Advertisement
According to  Ian Rapoport of NFL Network , Peterson will still earn the $11.75 million he is owed this season. In  a statement announcing the decision , the Vikings said he would be away from the team "until the legal proceedings are resolved."
Even if you ignore the public-relations problems that would come with keeping Peterson on the team, the Vikings could save a ton of money by releasing him. Peterson is three years into a six-year, $96 million contract extension. However, the Vikings have already paid out the $36 million in guaranteed money that the contract contained,  according to Spotrac.  That means they can cut Peterson without paying him a dime of the ~$56 million he is owed between now and 2017. The only financial penalty of cutting him would be a small cap hit ($2.7 million this year and $2.4 million in 2015, Spotrac reports).
Because Peterson's contract is non-guaranteed from here on, the Vikings have no real incentive to keep him. Even before the allegations of child abuse, Peterson's contract was a knock against him. He's  the 12th-highest-paid player in the NFL this year . In a time when running backs are less important than ever before, Peterson is getting paid like one of the league's most important players.
Grantland's Bill Barnwell had Peterson as only the  42nd-most valuable asset in the NFL this summer  because his contract was so massive. Barnwell said that giving 11% of your salary cap money to a running back is nuts, no matter who he is:
Your typically good Adrian Peterson season is 15 games, 300 carries, 1,400 rushing yards, and 12 touchdowns. That comes with a cap hit, in 2014, of $14.4 million. No other back in football is above $10 million, and the median starting running back has a cap hit of somewhere around $3.4 million. That’s $11 million you can’t put toward an offensive line or a secondary or, yes, a quarterback. If you know you’re going to get a 2,000-yard season out of Peterson like you did in 2012, you would happily pay that extra $11 million. But you’re more likely to get the typical Adrian Peterson season, like 2013’s 279-1,266-10 line, which isn’t far off from what somebody like Alfred Morris can do for $500,000. Every team would love to have Peterson. Very few want to commit nearly 11 percent of its salary cap to a running back, even one as good as Peterson.

Adrian Peterson has a great contract.  The vikings have a terrible contract.   More...

Peterson's cap hit is $15 million for each of the next three seasons. That's a huge financial commitment even if he's is playing at a high level. It's a crippling financial commitment if he's not even on the field.
ESPN’s Chris Mortensen reports that the Vikings “do not foresee Peterson in their future.” That contradicts earlier reporting from ESPN’s Adam Schefter, who said that the team still intended to keep the running back . If the Vikings do keep Peterson on their roster, they're gambling on his resolving his legal issues, avoiding a lengthy suspension from the NFL, and returning to his superhuman form from 2012.

Market looks to avoid hangover after BABA euphoriaMarket looks to avoid hangover after Alibaba euphoria

The Alibaba IPO was big and the first-day pop of 38% made lots of people an awful lot of dough. But the broad U.S. stock market might suffer a short-term hangover after Friday’s BABA bash.
History says the stock market tends to take a breather after the exhilaration, hype and massive flood of new stock for sale after a big initial pubic offering. And the IPO of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, was the biggest first-day stock offering in history.
Early trading Monday in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index suggests market fatigue. The benchmark U.S. stock gauge, which hit a record intraday high of 2019.26 Friday before closing at 2010.40, was down 5 points, or 0.3%. And shares of Alibaba were also trading lower, off $2.89, or 3.1%, to $91. Alibaba shares closed at $93.89, up 38.1%, from its $68 offering price on Friday.
Ironically, some of the stock market weakness today is due to comments over the weekend at the G20 meeting by China’s finance minister suggesting that further stimulus measures in China are unlikely. Wall Street is concerned with slowing growth in China. The stock market was also hurt by a weaker-than-expected reading on existing home sales in August. Sales fell -1.8% vs. July to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.05 million units, below the 5.2 million analysts expected.
Wall Street will also get a broader gauge of the IPO market, as more than a dozen companies, albeit smaller ones, are slated to start selling shares to the public for the first time this week, according to IPO tracker Renaissance Capital.
Historical performance data show that it is not unusual for the broad market to struggle in the week and month after a big IPO. In fact, an analysis of S&P 500 performance following the biggest five IPOs dating  back to 2000 show that the index was down 0.1%, on average, a week after the first day of trading of giant IPOs. Three months later, the index was up just 0.3%.
Here’s how the S&P 500 fared a week and a month after the 5 biggest IPOs since 2000.

Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJIL), which is preparing to launch 4G services, Monday signed a master services agreement for tower sharing with Indus Towers.
Indus Towers, which is the largest tower company in the world, is a joint venture company of Bharti Group, Aditya Birla Group and Vodafone Group. It has 113,490 towers in 15 telecom circles across the country.
As part of the agreement, the telecom arm of  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) would utilise the tower infrastructure services being provided by Indus Towers to launch its services across the country, the company said in a statement.
The pricing would be based on prevailing market rates, the statement added.
"We are building our network through a combination of infrastructure network that we are creating on our own and those that we are renting from quality partners," RJIL Managing Director Sanjay Mashruwala said.
He added: "We already have such tower sharing agreements with all the major players in India, and this relationship with Indus Towers will further accelerate the rollout of our services."
The company has recently signed an agreement with GTL Infra for more than 27,800 towers across India. It had also signed pact with Viom Networks for its 42,000 towers,  Reliance Communications for its 45,000 towers, ATC India for its 11,000 towers, Tower Vision for its 8,400 towers, Ascend Telecom for its over 4,500 towers.
The company had also signed a deal with  Bharti Airtel to share infrastructure created by both parties to avoid duplication wherever possible.
"Our agreement with Reliance Jio will also bring benefits to our existing customers in the form of lower rentals and energy costs. At the same time, the infrastructure sharing will help in avoiding duplication of towers and benefit the environment through lower power and fuel consumption," Indus Towers CEO BS Shantharaju said.
Currently Indus Towers services 11 operators - Airtel, Vodafone, Idea , Aircel, Tata Teleservices, Uninor, Reliance Communications, Videocon, MTNL, BSNL and MTS.
RIL had earlier said that RJio will initially cover about 5,000 towns and cities accounting for over 90 percent of urban India, as well as over 215,000 villages, and the target is to expand this to over 600,000 villages.

Google launches initiatives in support of Digital India

(Google said the mobile app…)
NEW DELHI: Search giant Google today said it is working with government to launch a nationwide contest for developing a mobile application for the PM's Office, an initiative to support the Digital India programme.
"MyGov, the citizen engagement platform of the Government and Google are collaborating to launch a nationwide contest to develop a mobile app for the PM's Office," Google said in a statement.
Google said the mobile app will bring the PMO to every citizen and the contest will showcase how Indians can build a world class app.
As part of supporting the Prime Minister's vision, Google will run a number of initiatives which also include programmes such as helping women get online, getting Indian SMEs online and showcasing India's rich heritage and culture online which will further promote the digital empowerment of citizens.
The search giant said it will continue to build a vibrant language ecosystem online and help the government transition into the increasingly 'mobile' India.
To encourage digital literacy and Internet safety, Google is also introducing curriculum for schools, officials and elected representatives.
Google is working with the Department of Information Technology and other state governments to develop these initiatives.
"I'm happy Google is coming forward to roll out initiatives that will contribute to the Digital India vision. I'm sure others will come forward and join this moment," Department of Information Technology Secretary RS Sharma said.
Google India Vice President and Managing Director Rajan Anandan said India is already home to the third largest number of Internet users globally with 245 million users as of June 2014 and is on track to become the second largest user market by 2015 and a 500 million-user market by 2016.
"Yet, there are more than a billion people who will need to be brought online for India to realise the vision of a digitally connected, knowledge economy. Prime Minister Modi's Digital India programme will play a transformational role in achieving this," Anandan added.

More than 20% of Americans laid off the past five years are still unemployed and one in four who found work is in a temporary job, according to a survey out Monday.
The report underscores that despite a sharp drop in long-term unemployment recently, many people out of work at least six months are still struggling to recoup their former wages and lifestyles. Those idled for years face an even tougher road back to employment.
"While the worst effects of the Great Recession are over for most Americans, the brutal realities of diminished living standards endure for the 3 million American workers who remain jobless years after they were laid off," says Carl Van Horn, director of the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.
The center conducted the survey of 1,153 Americans, about 300 of them long-term unemployed, from July 24 to Aug. 3.
The ranks of the long-term unemployed have fallen by 31% the past year to 3 million. But many of those hired are in temporary or part-time slots, or full-time positions that pay less than their previous salaries.
Forty-three percent of all the unemployed people surveyed were looking for part-time work over the summer, while only 26% sought full-time jobs, a reversal of the findings from the center's previous survey in January 2013.
"I think it's a reflection of the work available to them," Van Horn says. "The labor market is changing." Many employers have converted full-time jobs to part-time or temporary ones to increase efficiency and cut costs.
Workers fortunate enough to land full-time jobs often take significant pay cuts. Forty-six percent of those who found jobs after being laid off said their new job pays less than their previous one.
The financial hardship is greatest for those struggling with long-term unemployment. More than four in 10 sold possessions to make ends meet. More than a fifth moved in with friends or family. And nearly a third missed a mortgage or rent payment.
Nearly half of those out of work at least six months during the past five years estimate it will take three to 10 years to recover financially from the recession.
Despite their struggles, many of the chronically jobless do not benefit from government assistance, the survey shows. Just 38% are receiving unemployment insurance, and 83% of those who did get benefits lost them before finding another job. Last December, the federal government cut off benefits beyond the 26 weeks provided by states.
Most of those laid off during and after the recession received no other government assistance. Twenty-eight percent of the long-term unemployed get food stamps, the survey shows. But just 9% get help looking for a job and 4% are enrolled in a government-funded training program.
"The programs are not well-funded and a lot of people are not aware of them," Van Horn says.

Pilots to be empowered to deal with tipsy air travellersSep 22, 2014 at 07:59pm IST
Pilots to be empowered to deal with tipsy air travellers

New Delhi: Tipsy air travellers, beware! Laws are being tightened to empower crew members to restrain anyone from creating ruckus inside an aircraft or even at the airport before boarding a flight.
A new rule has been drafted by aviation regulator DGCA formally empowering the pilot-in-command of all flights to take suitable action to prevent such commotion which could endanger safety of the flight or passengers or crew members.
It empowers airline staff to "monitor" drunk passengers in lounges or at the airport check-points. The rule makes it mandatory for all airlines, including foreign carriers operating in Indian territory, as well as non-scheduled and charter operators, to evolve Standard Operating Procedures to deal with such situations.
The draft comes a month after a drunk Indian passenger had to be tied up on board an Air India flight from Melbourne to Delhi when he created a mid-air rumpus after having one too many.
#dgca #air india #iata
The draft comes a month after a drunk Indian passenger had to be tied up on board an Air India flight from Melbourne to Delhi when he created a mid-air rumpus after having one too many. He was arrested by police after the plane landed here on charges of causing hurt and wrongful restraint.
Such incidents have been on the rise globally, with the airlines' body International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimating that the number of unruly behaviour reported by airlines had reached some 8,000 cases in 2013.
The proposed rule or Civil Aviation Requirement says that disruptive behaviour of a passenger could not only aggravate discomfort to passengers or disturb crew members from doing their job, but also endanger safety and security of a flight.
Although unruly passengers represent a "minute" proportion of passengers, "we must not forget that one aggressive passenger can jeopardise the entire safety on board an aircraft," official sources said.
Existing laws in India provide imprisonment of disruptive passengers for up to one year or pay up a fine of up to Rs five lakh or both. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked all stakeholders to submit their comments on the draft law within a month, they said.

Commissioner transferred for launching drive against medical malpractices; lawyers  student leaders  politiciansprotestPrint
Written by Prashant Pandey | Allahabad | Posted: September 22, 2014 8:28 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 8:45 pm
People from various sections of the society here have protested against the transfer of Commissioner (Allahabad Division), Badal Chatterjee. Chatterjee had joined as Allahabad Commissioner on February 10 earlier this year and was transferred on September 19. He has currently been put on the waiting list.
Chatterjee, who was with the state civil services before being allotted the 1998-batch of the IAS officers, had recently launched a concerted drive against the malpractices existing in the medical field, including the problem of teachers and doctors in Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital (which is attached the Motilal Nehru Medical College) being involved in private practice. Besides, the nexus between drug suppliers and the doctors was also on the target. The transfer is being allegedly seen as the handiwork of those getting affected by the actions.
The Allahabad High Court Bar Association (AHCBA) and the District Bar Association on Monday submitted a joint memorandum to the Chief Minister, through the District Magistrate, condemning the transfer and demanding that the order be withdrawn.
“In a joint meeting, we have issued a statement saying that the officer was acting in public interest because the unholy nexus in the medical field is rampant and he was taking action as per orders from the Allahabad High Court,” said AHCBA secretary Dr C P Upadhyay.
Upadhyay added that, although the two Associations did not formally give a strike call, many lawyers protested at various places, including outside the high court against the transfer. “If the government does not revoke it, we will intensify our agitation,” he said.
Congress MLA from City (North), Anugraha Narayan Singh, said: “The officer has been working hard in public interest. Besides, his retirement was due in February next year. He should have been allowed to remain within his home district. Moreover, it is not that the government has transferred him because he was gravely needed elsewhere. Instead, he has been put on waiting list, which is an insult. We, as residents of Allahabad and leaders from our students’ days, have expressed our objections to the CM through a faxed message and requested him to revoke it.”
Singh added that, apart from him, former students’ union leaders like Vinod Chandra Dubey (now, a long-timer in the Samajwadi Party), Shyama Krishna Pandey (now in Congress) and some other leaders jointly signed the statement in this regard.
A section of the Allahabad University students, led by outdoing Students’ Union president Kuldeep Singh K D, had also staged a protest on Sunday. They had also submitted a memorandum to the district authorities demanding that the transfer order be revoked.
Earlier, on July 11, the Allahabad High Court, while hearing a PIL, had ordered the Commissioner to constitute a committee that would check the practice of government teachers and doctors. The court had passed the order after it was brought to its notice that a Government Order (GO) of 2003 expressly made the Commissioner responsible for checking the menace. It had also sought a report on the same by the Commissioner by October 28.

For Ganga clean up  Uma Bharti studies Gujarat work on SabarmatiriverBharti was on her one-day visit to Gujarat primarily to observe the work done by Gujarat Government to preserve and develop Sabarmati river which could be replicated in the Ganga Rejuvenation project.
Express News Service | Gandhinagar | Posted: September 22, 2014 8:17 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 8:31 pm
Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Uma Bharti  has formed a committee to find out the path of dried up Saraswati river near Siddhpur in Patan district which may help increase ground water level in the region. Bharti said so while talking to media persons on her one-day visit to Gujarat on Monday primarily to observe the work done by Gujarat Government to preserve and develop Sabarmati river which could be replicated in the Ganga Rejuvenation project.
Bharti said that Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had done a lot of work on this (finding path of the dried-up Saraswati river) and added that her ministry had formed a committee which included Gujarat-cadre IAS officer posted with the ministry as additional secretary, Amarjeet Singh, for the task.
She also stated that the committee would make efforts to find out the path of dried-up rivers in the country. She said that this would not necessarily mean effort to recharge the river, but it would certainly help in efforts to increase overall ground water level in the region. She added that it was yet not known if the river could be recharged.
Explaining the primary object of her visit Bharti said, “I have come to see the work done by Gujarat Government on the Sabarmati river. Former Chief Minister of Gujarat who is now the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has given me a very important task of rejuvenating Ganga-Yamuna and sister rivers. A lot of work has been done in Gujarat (on water resources) and so, I am going to visit Sabarmati river. Our department will study the work (done by Gujarat Government there)…”
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done good work in all the subjects in Gujarat. And in the field of water resources, massive work has been done in Gujarat,” she added.
In the morning, Bharti had visited Siddhpur to offer prayers on Matru Shraddha. “Today is a very auspicious day, its Krishna Chaturdashi. And so, I had gone there (Siddhpur) for Matru Shraddha.”
Later in the day, Bharti had paid a courtesy visit to Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel during which she also talked on the work done by Gujarat Government on Sabarmati river.
Sabarmati Riverfront recently came into lime-light when Chinese President, Xi Jinping, and a huge Chinese delegation accompanied by him was hosted by Modi there near Subhash Bridge in Ahmedabad.
After meeting Patel at Swarnim Sankul in New Secretariat in Gandhinagar in the afternoon, Bharti spoke to media persons wherein she refused to comment on the political imbroglio between BJP and Shivsena in Maharashtra on seat sharing continued…

Walk your patriotism talk: UP Muslims to Narendra ModiComments
Narendra Modi’s conciliatory statement on Indian Muslims has stirred a debate among Uttar Pradesh’s 40 million Muslims, with community leaders agreeing that their lingering distrust of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could be removed if the prime minister walked the talk.
Modi praised the patriotism of Indian Muslims in an interview with CNN last week, saying they could live and die for their country.
The comments have been variously analysed. While some felt it was aimed at broadening his appeal among moderate Hindus and minorities after reverses in a string of by-polls so early on in his term as prime minister, the Congress said the remarks were made to please his American audience ahead of his US visit and did nothing to tamp down Hindu fundamentalists.
But, among the Muslims of Uttar Pradesh, Modi’s words have sparked deep interest over whether they reflected a fundamental shift in the way the prime minister perceived the community and signalled an effort to reach out to it.

A common gripe appeared to refer to Modi’s ability to articulate a moderate position with his party’s ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and numerous other radical Hindu fringe groups.
“It does seem that in his new job and beset with huge responsibilities Modi is certainly trying to attain acceptability of all sections -- a la Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP’s moderate face,” Prof Mohib-ul-Haque of the political science department of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) told HT.
“But for that to happen, he would have to defy the RSS as well as the fringe elements within the (Sangh) Parivar who have been pushing a divisive agenda,” he said, adding that if Modi followed up on his words it could help Muslims drop their “hostility” towards the BJP.
Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, a prominent Lucknow-based cleric, said though he had read comments questioning the timing of the statement, one could hardly disagree with the prime minister.
“Modiji has said that no Muslim would ever side with Al-Qaeda, a terrorist organisation. Now, why should anyone contest that? It’s a fact. Only a crazy person would choose otherwise,” said Sadiq.
But Modi’s unusual praise for the community also caught many Muslims unawares, highlighting the deep religious fault lines over a man many accuse of turning a blind eye to a communal massacre on his watch as chief minister of Gujarat in 2002.
For Shafiq Ahmad, a Noida-based engineer, Modi’s remarks were unexpected.
“It would take a while before the real import of the message sinks in,” Ahmad said.
“It does appear to be an image-makeover attempt. Nothing wrong with that but for it to succeed, Modi would really have to control rabble rousers in the Parivar who often tinker with communal issues for political gains.”
On its part, the RSS is looking to use Modi’s comments to build bridges with Muslims in Uttar Pradesh.
Read: Here's why Modi’s defence of Muslims is expediently wise
“We would be popularizing Modi’s statement among the minorities,” said Mairajdhwaj, an RSS pracharak associated with the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, a Hindu body floated to build consensus among the minorities on contentious issues like the Ram temple.
“I think as far as RSS is concerned it has always stood by nationalist Muslims and the PM’s statement simply underlines it.”
Many Muslims appeared to agree with that argument.
“It’s an emotionally satisfying statement, one that would help Muslims understand that BJP or Modi are not going to eat up the minorities,” said Iqbal Ahmad, a prominent surgeon in Haleema Hospital of minority dominated Mau district.
"Before the Lok Sabha polls, Congress continued to play up Modi's failure to stop the 2002 riots in Gujarat. But the Congress too is guilty of Babri demolition.
“In fact, maximum riots took place with Congress in power. With a little tact Modi can actually help Muslims start believing and trusting the BJP." --

Xi stresses military headquarters  loyalty to Partyprint
The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) should be combat ready for a regional war, President Xi Jinping has said, adding that the armed forces’ chain of command should strictly follow the central leadership’s instructions.
Addressing a closed door meeting with top PLA officers on Sunday, Xi said the armed forces should have complete faith and loyalty to the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) leadership.
Following the meeting, the Chinese defence ministry issued a statement on Monday, stating that the PLA must follow orders issued by President Xi.
Besides being the President and the head of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Xi also heads the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC), which oversees China’s vast armed forces, the largest in the world.
“All PLA forces should follow the instructions of President Xi and update their operations to meet new goals and missions set by the CMC,” the defence ministry statement said.
It was not the first time that Xi has urged the PLA to be ready for a “regional war”, but the statement assumes significance as he said it again days after incursions by the Chinese army cast a long shadow over his three-day India visit.
In the order of things, the PLA is expected to always follow the lead from the civilian government. But Monday’s statement reiterating that fact could trigger speculation among strategists whether the chain of command leading up to Xi was, in fact, working smoothly or not.
 “Headquarters of PLA forces must have absolute loyalty and firm faith in the CPC, guarantee a smooth chain of command and make sure all decisions from the central leadership are fully implemented,” Xi was quoted as telling the officers in the meeting.
Xi then urged them to be combat ready for a “regional war”.
“Headquarters of all PLA forces should improve their combat readiness and sharpen their ability to win a regional war in the age of information technology,” he said.
Official news agency, Xinhua, quoted him as saying that the PLA should “strictly discipline themselves and the armies as well as contribute to the reform of national defence”.
The PLA chiefs of staff met in Beijing on Sunday to discuss how to improve “the efficiency of military command under new circumstances”.
Military commanders should have a better understanding of international and domestic security situations as well as the latest military development, Xi said. Meanwhile, the foreign ministry on Monday continued to play down the PLA incursion into Ladakh.
“We can say that President Xi’s visit to India has removed some of the suspicions of the two countries and pushed bilateral relations to a new age,” spokesperson, Hua Chunying said.
 “As for border issue, and whether it will influence President Xi’s visit, I want to say that this is totally unnecessary suspicion because two leaders have reached important consensus on politically resolving the border issue through a friendly mechanism. We have an effective mechanism for the border issue…and through effective communication can resolve and control disputes.”
She declined to comment on the decision by the Indian government to withdraw clearances for senior Chinese journalists who were heading to New Delhi to attend a media exchange programme.

We need to fix how we compensate the wrongly convictedAwful news, via the NY Post :
Jailed more than two decades for a crime he did not commit, William Lopez’s brief taste of freedom came to a sudden, tragic end Saturday when the man died just days before his $124 million lawsuit for false imprisonment was set to start.
The 55-year-old Bronx man had finally been freed in January 2013, after 23 years behind bars for murder, but a massive asthma attack ended Lopez’s short post-prison life at about 1 a.m. Saturday, his lawyer told The Post.
Supporters said his unexpected demise denied him the justice he deserved.
“He was always looking forward to being compensated,” said his friend and criminal lawyer Jeffrey Deskovic. “His life was really robbed from him.”
Lopez had hoped whatever money he got from the suit would help him enjoy a few of the comforts he was denied in prison.
“He wanted to do some domestic travel to other states, and to travel internationally,” Deskovic said. “He wanted to go to college and to go to law school. He wanted to set his wife up in business, and he wanted to be an entrepreneur.”
“It feels great to be back on Earth,’’ Lopez said after his release. “I’m looking forward to restoring my life as best as I can.’’
Read more about Lopez in this New York Times profile from February.
At the moment, 20 states still have no law at all to compensate the wrongly convicted. That seems flat-out callous. Over the last 25 years, DNA testing has made it overwhelmingly clear that our criminal justice system is quite capable of convicting the wrong person. And whatever flaws in the system produced those wrongful convictions are almost certainly also affecting the far larger number of cases for which DNA isn’t a factor.
But even the states that do compensate the innocent often include stipulations that can make it difficult for victims to collect, such as prohibiting payouts to anyone who failed to contest their conviction, or who falsely confessed to police. This is particularly pernicious when you consider that prosecutors often push for harsher sentences against suspects who maintain their innocence, or offer more lenient sentences to those who plead guilty. Most states also require a full exoneration before a victim can be compensated. That usually means anything short of a DNA test won’t make the cut. Sometimes when exculpatory evidence is discovered after conviction, a prosecutor will make an offer to the defendant to plead guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for a lighter sentence that will enable the defendant to be released. Turning the deal down could mean more months or years in prison fighting the conviction. But accepting it would generally make the defendant ineligible for compensation.
Most states that offer compensation offer a set amount of money for each year of incarceration — the Innocence Project recommends $50,000 per year. But once the victim dies, the checks stop coming. You can’t pass the compensation on to your family.  That seems patently unfair, for a few reasons. First, it assumes that the only victim of a wrongful conviction is the person who is sent off to prison. But the families of innocent people convicted of horrible crimes certainly suffer, too. Spouses lose companionship. Children lose parents. Parents are robbed of seeing their son or daughter realize their full potential.
Second, for those wrongly convicted people who do have children, each year in prison is a year they could have been providing for their kids, and for their kids’ future. If the state wrongly takes 20 of your prime earning years, it doesn’t seem like too much to ask that the state give you the peace of mind of knowing that your children will be financially secure after you die.
Third, it gets the state off the hook. Compensation schemes are meant to be restorative not punitive, but if the government wrongly incarcerated a man for decades, it hardly feels like justice for the government to benefit financially from the fact that the victim just happened to die before collecting his first check.
Finally, for a real-world example of how this payout system falls well short of justice, consider the Tennessee case of Paul House , who served 22 years in prison before his conviction was overturned and he was released in 2008. While he was in prison, House developed multiple sclerosis. House’s doctors believe the state prison system was late diagnosing him, then under-treated him once he had been diagnosed. While in prison, House wasted away. He left prison a ghoulish, wheelchair-bound residuum of his former self. But because House wasn’t exonerated by DNA evidence, he is ineligible to take advantage of Tennessee’s law to compensate the wrongly convicted. His best hope now lies with Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, making House’s compensation more of a political question than a legal one. What’s more, even if he is eventually compensated, the state gets to stop paying once House dies. Which means every year that prosecutors fought House’s release in spite of growing evidence of his innocence, every year that the state kept in prison and under-treated his disease, and every year that Tennessee governors fail to act in his case is one less year Tennessee has to send checks to Paul House.
On top of all of that, unless he is granted some sort of exemption, it could end up making more financial sense for House to refuse compensation even if it’s offered to him. House’s extensive medical bills are currently covered under Tennessee Medicare. But if he is exonerated and eligible for compensation, the new income could make him ineligible for Medicare. For someone in House’s condition, that could end up being a net loss.
Of course, not all wrongly convicted people have House’s medical problems. But it remains true that so long as the compensation checks stop once the victim dies, the state benefits financially by delaying an official exoneration for as long as possible.

Madam Secretary and the sex appeal of TVs most powerful womenBy Alyssa Rosenberg September 22 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
This image released by CBS shows Tea Leoni as Elizabeth McCord, the shrewd, determined, newly appointed Secretary of State in “Madam Secretary,” premiering Sept. 21. (AP Photo/CBS, Craig Blankenhorn)
“Madam Secretary,” which stars Téa Leoni as Elizabeth McCord, a former CIA operative and university professor who finds herself suddenly elevated to the position of Secretary of State, is a throwback in a lot of ways.
Like “The West Wing,” it is a show based on the idea that competence and dedication to doing the right thing can cut through pretty much any form of nonsense. And like plenty of other shows about Washington and politics, “Madam Secretary” is oriented outside the Beltway –Elizabeth and her husband  Henry (Tim Daly) live, teach, and ride horses in what appears to be Virginia–without quite knowing why it makes a difference to focus on D.C. proper rather than Virginia or Maryland.
But most of all, “Madam Secretary” breaks with the current vogue by making Elizabeth a little insecure about her new-found authority. I had series creator Barbara Hall walk me through a scene from the pilot in which Elizabeth talks out some of those feelings with her husband:
"Madam Secretary" stars Tea Leoni as a former CIA analyst plucked from academia to be the newly-appointed Secretary of State. Executive producer Barbara Hall annotates a scene between Leoni and her husband, played by Tim Daly. (The Washington Post)
One of the most delicious things about television right now is its profusion of powerful women whose ultra-competence and cool confidence is an enormous part of their sex appeal.
On “The Good Wife,” which CBS has paired with “Madam Secretary” on Sunday nights , attorney Alicia Florrick’s (Julianna Margulies) cool, devastating style helped fuel her career resurgence after her cheating, corrupt husband (Chris Noth) was sent to prison. It also drew men, including her boss, Will Gardner (Josh Charles), her competitor-turned-business partner Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry) and clients like the sexually adventurous Colin Sweeney (Dylan Baker) and the eccentric Matthew Ashbaugh (John Noble) to her.
Similarly on “Scandal,” Washington fixer Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) finds herself both a magnet for and drawn to men who see her as a potential savior. She begins an affair with Fitzgerald Grant (Tony Goldwyn) as she is doing a turn-around job on his presidential campaign, and then gets entangled with Jake Ballard (Scott Foley), a wounded veteran of her father’s covert operations program. The last season of the show ended with Olivia in a peculiar position: rather than trying to save Fitz, Jake, or either man’s career, she and Jake head off to try to make a go of it as partners, rather than as rescuer and rescued.
Even “Political Animals,” a USA miniseries about a Secretary of State (Sigourney Weaver) who has more in common with Hillary Rodham Clinton than Elizabeth McCord does, played with the idea that a powerful woman is a turn-on . Weaver’s globe-trotting chief diplomat had to fend off requests from dates from ambassadors and attachés, even in her 60s.
So as Elizabeth settles into her role as Secretary of State, let’s hope she stops fretting about her so-called “masculine energy” and starts to own it instead. If Hall wants to use “Madam Secretary” to give us a portrait of a power woman with a functional marriage, she might do well to take a note from some existing hits. Instead of having Elizabeth stress about whether Henry still finds her attractive, maybe Hall should let both of the McCords enjoy the frisson her new job brings into their bedroom, rather than making Elizabeth fret about it.

California woman gives birth next to a freeway. Her Marine Corps husband was terrified.Bolivar Vilchez kisses his newborn daughter, Savannah, at Kaiser Permanente in Anaheim, Calif. (Nick Agro/The Orange County Register via Associated Press)
A funny thing happened on the way to Sandra Vilchez’s mother’s house.
She gave birth.
On the shoulder of a California freeway.
Vilchez, 29, was in her family’s Chevy Tahoe on Sunday, on the way from Riverside County to her mother’s house in Downey, when her water broke, the Orange County Register reported . Her husband, Bolivar Vilchez, was barreling down the freeway, driving in the toll lanes of State Route 91 in Orange County, the Register said.
Her contractions were underway. The baby wasn’t going to wait.
“All of sudden I get this horrible pain that I had felt before with the other ones,” she recalled, according to the Los Angeles NBC affiliate . “I told my husband, ‘She’s coming now,’ and I yelled because her head was coming out.”
Bolivar Vilchez “swung the car across the freeway, parked and ran to the passenger side to help his wife,” the Register reported.
Within seconds, as he was on the phone with an Anaheim Fire Department emergency dispatcher while simultaneously holding the baby’s head, Savannah slipped out into his arms, Bolivar said.
“At the next contraction, we had a beautiful baby in front of us,” he said.
The baby’s father, a 35-year-old Marine Corps veteran, told KNBC he was “terrified” by his stint in the roadside delivery suite, about 12 miles from Disneyland.
“Needless to say, I saw my baby, she’s blue, I didn’t know anything,” he said. “I mean, 18 years in the Marines Corps, you get all this training, but you’re not trained to deliver babies on the side of the 91, especially your own.”
Paramedics arrived shortly after the birth, the Register said, and brought the mother and child to an Anaheim hospital.
Savannah Vilchez was 11 pounds, 6 ounces, and 22 inches at birth.
Her abrupt arrival apparently startled her siblings: According to the Register, the other Vilchez children — ages 6, 4 and 3 — were in the SUV, asking their mother if she was okay.
“Is Savannah doing this to you?” they asked, worried.
“The whole time, I said: ‘We’re fine, we’re fine,’” Sandra said.
(Nick Agro/The Orange County Register via Associated Press)
An Orange County fire official told the Register that roadside births are “much more common than people think.”
In the Washington area, there have been at least two such births in the last 11 months alone. In October, a child was delivered just off the outer loop of the Beltway. And several months ago, a baby was born alongside I-270 in Germantown .

Does Neil deGrasse Tyson make up storiesBy Jonathan H. Adler September 22
Neil deGrasse Tyson may well be America’s most prominent scientist.  He is the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, and a research associate in the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History, both in New York.  He was the host for Fox’s “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey” and PBS’s “NOVA ScienceNow.”  He is a prominent lecturer and public intellectual, and may be more well known than Bill Nye, the Science Guy.  He is a noted authority on science and current affairs — and yet, according to at least one critic, he may have a habit of making up some of the tales he tells in his speeches. In a series of articles for  The Federalist , a right-leaning Web magazine, Sean Davis makes a strong case that Tyson has a habit of telling tall tales.  The details of one personal story – what happened when Tyson was called for jury duty — vary with each telling. Other tales, such as quotes attributed to members of Congress and unnamed journalists, seem too good to be true, and prove difficult to verify. Most significantly, Tyson attributes a quote to a September 2001 speech by former President George W. Bush that no one can seem to find.   Here’s Davis :
According to Tyson, in the days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Bush uttered the phrase, “Our God is the God who named the stars.” According to Tyson, the president made that claim as a way of segregating radical Islam from religions like Christianity or Judaism.
TYSON: Here’s what happens. George Bush, within a week of [the 9/11 terrorist attacks] gave us a speech attempting to distinguish we from they. And who are they? These were sort of the Muslim fundamentalists. And he wants to distinguish we from they. And how does he do it?
He says, “Our God” — of course it’s actually the same God, but that’s a detail, let’s hold that minor fact aside for the moment. Allah of the Muslims is the same God as the God of the Old Testament. So, but let’s hold that aside. He says, “Our God is the God” — he’s loosely quoting Genesis, biblical Genesis — “Our God is the God who named the stars.”
[ Link to video ] Neil deGrasse Tyson’s story has three central claims: 1) Bush uttered that precise phrase, 2) in the days immediately after 9/11, 3) in order to distance American religion from that practiced by radical Muslims. As you have probably already guessed, every single claim is false. Every one! Then there’s Tyson’s aside that Bush’s quote was a “loose quote” of the book of Genesis. Yep, that’s false, too.
Davis could not find any account of Bush having said anything remotely resembling the quote in the days following 9/11, and Bush’s speechwriters deny  this is something the president said.  I checked the WhiteHouse.gov archive of Bush speeches, too, and it’s not there.  (There is, however, a short speech on Islam as a religion of peace , which takes a very different tack than that which Tyson suggests.) The closest thing Davis could find to the quote Tyson attributes to Bush is from remarks the president gave in 2003.
The only similar quote came in February of 2003 after the crash of the space shuttle Columbia, when the president said , “The same Creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today.” However, contrary to what Tyson has repeatedly claimed, the Columbia space shuttle comment — which was wholly different in purpose, content, and timing than the alleged 9/11 quote cited by Tyson — was meant to unite the nation following a horrible tragedy, not divide it based on religion. And contrary to Tyson’s claim that the alleged quote was loosely taken from Genesis, the actual quote was taken from the book of Isaiah. A similar verse can also be found in Psalm 147 .
Note that the claims Davis contests are not casual remarks in conversation or responses to questions, but planned and repeated accounts.  The various stories Davis challenges are regularly repeated in Tyson’s lectures, and the Bush anecdote is highlighted on the Hayden planetarium Web site.  They are the sorts of claims someone of Tyson’s stature should not be making in public lectures unless they are, in fact, true. Politicians are routinely flayed for less — and we know Tyson is much smarter than the average politician. He should not be held to a lower standard. It is possible that all of the claims Tyson has made are accurate (save for all the variations of his jury duty tale).  The various quotes, including that by Bush, may well exist.  If so, I would think Tyson can provide citations.  If not, Tyson should acknowledge his errors. If the quotes are verified, by Tyson or someone else, I will update this post accordingly. I will also post any response I receive from Tyson, and link to any response from him published elsewhere.  Tyson’s agent had no response to this Daily Beast story , though a representative of the Hayden Planetarium apparently verified the Tyson comment referenced here .
[Note: Fixed a typo above - 2001 not 2011]
UPDATE: On his Facebook page , Neil deGrasse Tyson  responds to the allegations and, in the process, did not do himself any favors.  On the alleged bush quote, he initially insists it was based upon his own memory:
I have explicit memory of those words being spoken by the President. I reacted on the spot, making note for possible later reference in my public discourse. Odd that nobody seems to be able to find the quote anywhere — surely every word publicly uttered by a President gets logged.
FYI: There are two kinds of failures of memory. One is remembering that which has never happened and the other is forgetting that which did. In my case, from life experience, I’m vastly more likely to forget an incident than to remember an incident that never happened. So I assure you, the quote is there somewhere. When you find it, tell me. Then I can offer it to others who have taken as much time as you to explore these things.
One of our mantras in science is that the absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence.
So, initially, Tyson insisted that he was correct in his account of what Bush said and the context in which Bush said it.
Then, in response to comments , Tyson confesses that he must have made an error.
Good to see that the Bush quote was found. Thanks to all who did the searching. I transposed one disaster with another (both occurring within 18 months of one another) in my assigning his quote. Perhaps that’s a measure of how upset I was in both cases. The mind is surely the next mysterious universe to be plumbed.
What is really so “mysterious” is why Tyson finds it so difficult to confess error and pretends that bush’s 2003 remarks were only just-now discovered.  As noted above, Sean Davis had pointed to this quote as a potential source from the beginning .  Yet if this is the source of the quote, then nearly everything else Tyson claimed about it and its significance is false (as is his initial account of the source of the quote).
Tyson claims to be a man of science who follows the evidence where it leads. The evidence here clearly shows Tyson screwed up.  Whether knowingly or not, he regularly repeated a false account in order to cast aspersions on another public figure. The only proper thing to do is recant and apologize.
P.S. I am sure some of Tyson’s political adversaries would like to use this episode as a basis for attacking climate science or evolution. No dice. It does not work that way.  That Tyson told tall tales here tells us nothing about these other matters.

NIA suggests open case against ISIS  al Qaeda  seeks MHAnodPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 8:45 pm | Updated: September 23, 2014 1:57 am
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has sought the permission of the Ministry of Home Affairs to file a case against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
Following reports of Indian youths joining ISIS, the NIA is said to have suggested that an “open case” under provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and the UN Convention on terrorism could be filed against ISIS for brainwashing youths into committing acts of terror.
“We are still deliberating the specific sections under which the case would be registered. The Home Ministry is to take a final call on it,” a senior NIA official said.

Since the group has not committed any crime in India, the Home Ministry is exploring the possibility of registering the case under some preparatory sections, such as Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.
The section states: “Whoever conspires or attempts to commit, or advocates, abets, advises or incites or knowingly facilitates the commission of a terrorist act or any act preparatory to the commission of a terrorist act, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.”
Four men from Kalyan in Maharashtra had left to fight for the ISIS in June this year. One of them was reportedly killed while fighting for the group in Iraq. The US Central Intelligence Agency has said that ISIS, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has 50,000 cadre operating out of Iraq and Syria.

Maharashtra BJP split over allianceUpdated: September 23, 2014 03:30 IST

Plan B if ‘respectable’ share of seats not given
As tension over seat-sharing with ally Shiv Sena continues, there seems to be a sharp division in the BJP’s top Maharashtra leadership on keeping the alliance.
Though the BJP has taken the public stance that it “wants to keep” the 25-year-old alliance going, there is talk of a ‘plan B’ if the Shiv Sena does not give the BJP a “respectable” share of seats.
If the deadlock is not resolved, “it’s natural, for both sides,” to put into action ‘plan B,’ Om Mathur, BJP-in-charge of Maharashtra polls, told The Hindu.
‘Time will tell’
In case talks fail, “time will tell” the next course of action, Mr. Mathur said, leaving open all options.
Considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Mathur, however, reiterated that the party “wants to continue the alliance”.
“The Sena has not formally responded to our proposal. We are waiting for their response,” he said.
Maharashtra BJP split over parting ways with Sena
With Sept. 26, the last date for filing nominations for the Maharashtra Assembly elections nearing, the State BJP leaders are eagerly waiting for a direction from the central leadership.
The deadlock in the seat-sharing talks has triggered speculation that the parties could go their separate ways after being together for a quarter century.
The State BJP unit seems to be divided on the pros and cons of fighting without the Sena, with a section of leaders irritated by the long-time ally’s “stubborn” behaviour.
“The Sena is unnecessarily insisting on contesting more seats. We are only asking for a discussion on those 59 seats that it has never won. We want to keep the alliance but if we are kept at 119 you can consider the alliance as good as over. “It’s about self-respect after all,” said a senior leader.
The faction in favour of splitting believes that the party is equipped to go it alone despite the shortage of time.
“The party is ready. The development agenda of Mr. Modi is conducive for us to run alone,” said the leader.
He, however, admitted that going it alone at this moment would put the party at a “little disadvantage.”
However, the argument for running solo seems to be half-hearted. Though some leaders believe that the party missed an opportunity by not declaring to go solo after the Lok Sabha elections, they believe it is now “too late” for a breakup.
“For 25 years you do business, you can’t leave it at the last moment. It will send the wrong message to voters and prove detrimental for both sides,” said a senior leader. Clearly they do not want to cross the line as is evident from their restrained statements on the public challenge thrown by the Sena.

Olive Garden Comes To The Defense Of Its Unlimited Breadsticksreddit
Olive Garden has issued a strongly worded defense of its unlimited salad and breadsticks on Monday, because it had to.
In a 24-slide presentation published Monday , Darden, the owner of Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, The Capital Grille and others, defended its Italian chain's breadstick and salad strategy, complicated menu and overall “brand renaissance.” The report came just days after Starboard Value, an investment firm, issued a 294-slide presentation eviscerating everything from execs’ use of corporate jets to Olive Garden’s insistence on not salting the pasta water.
Darden called its endless salad and breadsticks an "icon of brand equity," and staunchly defended its tactic of piling tables high with buttery carbs and offering a bottomless bowl of salad soaked in Italian dressing.
"It conveys Italian generosity and our salads have the highest loyalty rating of any menu item based on the menu satisfaction surveys we conduct," the company said in the presentation.
Darden remained silent about its refusal to salt its pasta water. When asked about Olive Garden's pasta water, a Darden spokesperson referred The Huffington Post to the presentation.
Darden's full breadstick and salad defense, circled in red below:
Starboard's take on Olive Garden's salad and breadsticks, from its presentation released Thursday:
Darden and Starboard are currently locked in a battle over the restaurant company's future. Over the past several months, Darden has struggled as customers have ditched sit-down restaurants for fast-casual eateries like Chipotle and Panera Bread. The company reported a loss of $19.3 million on Friday and Olive Garden has had five quarters in a row of declining same-store sales, a key retail metric.
Starboard is urging shareholders to dump all 12 of Darden’s board members at the company’s shareholder meeting on October 10 and replace them with a group of its own nominees. Darden is offering a slate that includes four new independent candidates, four continuing independent candidates and four slots to be filled by Starboard, Matthew Stroud, the company's senior vice president of investor relations, said on a conference call with analysts on Friday.

360 000 Obamacare Enrollees At Risk Of Losing Subsidies360,000 Obamacare Enrollees At Risk Of Losing Subsidies
Posted:

More than 360,000 Obamacare enrolleess must confirm their incomes with the health insurance exchange or risk losing subsidies, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services official Andy Slavitt said Monday.
More than 360,000 individuals enrolled in health insurance via the Obamacare exchanges must provide federal authorities with updated information about their incomes by Sept. 30, or risk losing the subsidies that cut the cost of their coverage, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Monday.
Federal authorities will begin contacting 279,000 households, representing 363,000 individuals, on Monday to urge them to provide additional information about how much money they make because the figures submitted in their Obamacare subsidies applications don't match federal tax records, said Andy Slavitt, the principal deputy administrator of the Medicare and Medicaid agency, which also oversees the health insurance exchanges. More than 8 million people enrolled into private health insurance plans via the Obamacare exchanges during the six-month sign-up period that began last October, and 85 percent received subsidies.
Consumers who do not contact health insurance exchange authorities to verify the accuracy of their income or to offer up-to-date information risk seeing their tax credits reduced beginning next month, Slavitt said. These people may also have to repay the government if they received more subsidies than their income should have allowed.
Discrepancies between Obamacare applications and other federal records don't necessarily indicate consumers attempted to defraud the government, and enrollees may have submitted more accurate information than found in previous tax records, the agency emphasized in a press release.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services already has worked through the majority of the cases where records didn't match. As of May 30, income information about 1.2 million households, and more than 1.6 million people, wasn't consistent with other federal records. Since then, issues for 467,000 households have been resolved, and another 430,000 cases are in progress, according to the agency.
In addition, the agency disclosed that 115,000 enrollees haven't verified their citizenship or their immigration status, and will lose their health insurance coverage if they do not. Federal authorities set a Sept. 5 deadline for these individuals to provide accurate information about their legal status when they contacted 310,000 people last month. Advocates for immigrants have complained that some enrollees who attempted to comply encountered bureaucratic obstacles .
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will begin notifying those 115,000 enrollees that their coverage will be cut off at the end of the month. Those who wish to re-enroll with updated citizenship or immigration status documentation will be allowed to do so, Slavitt said.
The next Obamacare enrollment period begins Nov. 15 and runs through Feb. 15.

NHTSA launches #checkforbaby safety campaign to prevent heatstroke deaths from children left in cars.
#checkforbaby safety campaign raises awareness to prevent heatstroke death from children left in cars.
Today is National Heatstroke Prevention Day. #checkforbaby.
A rash of high-profile heat-related deaths of children left in hot cars has prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to launch the “Where’s baby? Look before you lock” public education campaign to highlight the dangers of vehicular-induced heatstroke.
Thursday, July 31 is National Heatstroke Prevention Day.

Forty-four children died in 2013 because they were left unattended in a hot vehicle and 17 deaths have been reported so far in 2014. Since 1998, more than half of the 606 deaths were caused by a child being forgotten in the car by a caregiver.
"The majority of these cases are accidental tragedies that can strike even the most conscientious and loving parents and caregivers, but they can be stopped," said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "Even one heatstroke death is one too many because every death caused by leaving a child unattended in a hot car is 100 percent avoidable."
Heatstroke can be caused by outside temperatures as low as the 60s or 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Even with external temps in the 60s, the interior of a car can heat up above 110 degrees. A child will die of heatstroke once their body temp reaches 107 degrees, according to NHTSA.
A car can heat up by 20 degrees in just ten minutes.
"Parents and caregivers are the first line of defense against these needless tragedies—but everyone in the community has a role to play," said NHTSA’s Acting Administrator David Friedman. "Prevention means never leaving children unattended in a vehicle and always checking the backseat before walking away. If a child is in distress in a hot car, bystanders should call 911 immediately."
In addition to calling 911, bystanders can call immediate service technicians such as Pop-a-Lock at 1-800-Pop-a-lock. The nearest responder will “leave all other priorities aside to arrive as soon as possible” to unlock the car. Launched in1991, the free community service has saved over 350,000 children locked in caregivers’ vehicles.
Bystanders are also urged to break a car window if the child is unresponsive, and to remove the child as quickly and safely as possible. NHTSA recommends cooling the child by spraying them with cool water, but not in an ice bath.

Why do auto manufacturer's have to tie this effort to baby seats? Why can't they just create some sort of vent that allows hot air above a given temperature to escape? It would really help all of us, not just those with babes or tots. The heat that builds up in a car parked in an...

America s 50 Best Cities To Live InTweet
Americans take into account different factors when choosing where to live. For some, the quality of schools is important. For others, the strength of the local economy or personal safety takes priority.
To determine America’s best cities to live in, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data on the 550 cities with populations of 65,000 or more as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau. Based on a range of variables, including crime rates, employment growth, educational attainment, and housing affordability, 24/7 Wall St. identified America’s 50 Best Cities to Live.
Click here to read our methodology.
Because of its importance, the labor market was one of the key measures we used to identify the best cities. In order to be considered, a city needed positive employment growth between 2011 and 2013. Seventy cities did not meet this standard. Cities scored well if employment growth was high. Olathe, Kansas, one of the best cities to live in, received considerable marks because it had 14.4% employment growth — one of the best during that time.
In the U.S., the national unemployment rate was 7.4% in 2013, high by historical standards. And in many cities it was much worse. Because unemployment is such an important factor, we also eliminated cities from consideration if their unemployment rates were more than 33% above the 2013 national rate — our cutoff rate was 9.8%. This alone excluded more than 100 cities from consideration.
Of course, the availability of jobs is not enough to make a city worth moving to. For many Americans, safety is also important. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) data, violent crime rates were far higher in metropolitan areas — where the vast majority of Americans live — than in smaller cities and other parts of the country. Roughly half of all cities were excluded because they reported property or violent crime rates that were at least 25% higher than the 2012 national rates.
The vast majority of the nation’s best cities to live in had especially low violent crime rates. In fact, the violent crime rate in 35 of the 50 cities was less than half the national rate of 387 incidents per 100,000 residents in 2012.
For parents, a strong school system also influences the decision of where to live. According to Daren Blomquist, vice president of RealtyTrac , a housing market data site, “quality of education is the number one issue home buyers ask about most.”
In order to compare educational outcomes in each city, we ranked math, language arts and science scores tabulated by Homefacts, a RealtyTrac subsidiary. Seven of the top 10 cities on our list were among the top 10% of large cities nationwide for math achievement and eight were among the top 10% for language arts.
We also measured the availability of amenities, such as restaurants, theaters and fitness clubs. While such factors might seem like an afterthought, Americans spend an average of more than five hours each day on leisure activities, according to the Census Bureau.
“There is still romance in buying a house,” said Blomquist. Features such as access to outdoor activities, beautiful parks and gyms “are the type of amenities that often will set apart certain communities from others.”

A meeting of all stakeholders has been convened in the national capital on Friday to seek their views on a key bill that seeks to pave the way for construction of a large number of affordable houses .
The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill, 2013 is likely to be taken up for consideration in the Winter Session of the Parliament.
"We have convened a meeting of all stakeholders to seek their views and suggestions on the bill," a senior official of the Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Ministry said.
Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday discussed various aspects of the bill with his officials. The Narendra Modi-government has promised houses for all by 2022.
Naidu emphasised that the bill, while seeking to promote housing activities, should aim at harmonising the concerns of consumers and real estate developers, rather than introducing strangulation in the name of regulation.
The minister said the bill should promote transparency in disclosures by developers with regard to all relevant information about real estate projects by registering them with the proposed regulator.
Besides Naidu and ministry officials, representatives of the Ministries of Environment and Forests and Climate Change, Consumer Affairs, Civil Aviation and Culture would attend the meeting.
Issues like protection of consumers' interests and single window system for approval of real estate projects will also come up for discussion.
Officials of Consumer Welfare Association, Federation of Apartment Owners Associations, Professional Associations like legal firms and management consultants, National Real Estate Development Council, and Council of Real Estate Developers Associations of India will also attend.
After this exercise, Naidu will hold a meeting with ministers concerned before firming up the official amendments to be moved, if required.
There is a suggestion from the real estate sector to rename the Bill as Real Estate (Regulation and Promotion) Bill.

National Seat Check Saturday aims to curb child fatalities from car accidentsNational Seat Check Saturday aims to curb child fatalities from car accidents
carseats and belts
90 percent of child safety seats are not installed correctly. Learn how on National Seat Check Saturday.
Proper buckling can reduce child fatalities and injuries caused by car accidents by 70 pct.
Saturday is National Car Seat Check day.
Installing child safety seats in cars can be a frustrating experience. Finding out that nine out of ten child safety seats are not installed correctly, according to the Illinois State Police, is downright frightening.
8
Car accidents are the second leading cause of death in children up to the age of 14, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over 33 percent of children killed in 2012 were not properly buckled in, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
A rash of high-profile heat-related deaths of children left in hot cars has prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to launch the “Where’s baby? Look before you lock” public education campaign to highlight the dangers of vehicular-induced heatstroke. ( Robert Duffer, Chicago Tribune )
National Seat Check Saturday aims to curb such preventable deaths. On September 20, National Seat Check Saturday concludes Child Passenger Safety Week , a nationwide campaign to raise awareness of proper buckling techniques and safety issues that has been supported by agencies ranging from the CDC to Safe Kids Worldwide.
Buckling children in age- and size-appropriate car seats can reduce the risk of serious and fatal injuries by over 70 percent for infants and 45 percent for grade school children.
0
Clinics are being presented on Saturday at national, state and local levels to demonstrate proper installation and safe seat inspections.
In Chicagoland, there are nearly 50 car seat check sites, ranging from police and fire departments to big box stores, banks, car dealerships, hospitals and restaurants, according to this list by seatcheck.net .
The Illinois Tollway and Illinois Police District 15 are adding fun to the informational with its 7th Annual Family Safety Fair in Downers Grove, (2700 Ogden Avenue), taking place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. It will include inspections and installation demos, as well as rollover simulator, recall info, an inflatable fire truck slide, District 15 police motorcycle demonstration, big rigs and squad cars to touch, and the Jesse White Tumbling Team.
Our partners at Cars.com , who have a four-person team of certified car seat technicians that conduct a car seat check in every car they review, advise caregivers to bring their child, the car seat, the seat’s manual and the vehicle owner’s manual to inspection sites. Also, it’s not just an installation but a demonstration so caregivers can learn proper technique.
If you can’t make an event for National Seat Check Saturday, ongoing car seat checks can be conducted by local police and fire departments, and NHTSA has a database where you can search by zip code for car seat checks.

Vice Editor Says No Collusion  With ISIS For DocumentaryEditor Of Vice News Says There Was ‘No Collusion' With ISIS For Documentary
Posted:
reddit
NEW YORK -– Vice News editor-in-chief Jason Mojica shot down an accusation Thursday night that his news organization may have "colluded" with militants from the Islamic State, or ISIS, in order to gain access for its recent, widely praised documentary .
“I can certainly say that there is no collusion between Vice News and the Islamic State as much as there is a bit of sparring and each of us probably trying to get something different out of [the experience],” Mojica said.
Mojica made his comments during an NYU panel in response to a question from journalist Gil Shefler, which was followed by another member of the audience accusing Vice News of collusion. The panel, moderated by The New York Times' Amy O'Leary, featured editors from several outlets that are currently expanding their international footprints: Mojica, BuzzFeed foreign editor Miriam Elder and Mashable global news editor Louise Roug.
Prior to the audience Q&A, O’Leary raised the issue of access and whether Vice News had possibly aided the propaganda efforts of the Islamic State, an organization that hasn’t permitted any other western journalists to report openly in areas it controls and recently beheaded journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.
“In the case of 'The Islamic State,' that was a very unique case and it comes with, of course, conditions in order to get in and get out with your life,” Mojica said. “You understand you’re operating under a very peculiar set of rules.”
Mojica declined to elaborate when asked what "conditions,” specifically, were agreed upon with the militants. But he said that Vice News tried to reveal as much as possible about how it filmed in Syria and suggested there wasn’t a need to overtly label what was being shown as propaganda.
“You understand you’re being brought around from place to place by a tour guide, by a press officer and things like that,” Mojica said. “It may be a little subtle. We don’t hit you over the head with it. But our goal isn’t to stand there in voiceover, sit there and say, ‘Well, this is obviously propaganda.’ We have enough trust in our audience to be able to kind of read between the lines.”
In early August, Kevin Sutcliffe, Vice’s head of news programming in Europe, told The Huffington Post that "Islamic State" filmmaker Medyan Dairieh was able to gain access to the group through his deep contacts in the region and because its members were familiar with the two previous films he made inside civil war-torn Syria.
Sutcliffe acknowledged at the time that Dairieh hadn't been able to travel freely during his reporting trip inside Syria and was always accompanied by a minder from the Islamic State. “These are managed trips, so you are there with their permission,” Sutcliffe said.
It was clear in the five-part documentary that Dairieh had been led around by press officer Abu Mosa, who was reportedly killed last month by Syrian government forces.
In a way, Vice News staffers' dealings were similar to those of journalists who embed with the U.S. military, in that they were restricted from venturing off unaccompanied. But with the U.S. military, there is an established protocol and application process for embedding journalists. That's not the case with the Islamic State, which is better known for killing journalists than opening up to them, so Vice News' ability to strike any sort of deal with the group has understandably raised questions about the conditions involved.
Given that Islamic State militants controlled Dairieh’s movements while on the ground, it might be assumed they also vetted the video he shot before allowing him to leave. However, a Vice News spokesman told The Huffington Post that the Islamic State did not see the video in advance -- perhaps because the group already knew exactly where he'd been, since he was always accompanied by a minder.
Near the end of the panel, Mojica explained why both the news outlet and subject would have something to gain from striking a deal for access.
“I think that every interaction between a journalist and a subject is basically an act of combat in which two parties are both trying to get very different things out of a shared experience,” Mojica said. “I think that the folks in the Islamic State are not dumb. So I have to assume they have their reasons for giving us the access that they did.”
Speaking hypothetically, he said Islamic State militants might have been familiar with Vice News' immersive style, which is more about presenting what's happening on the ground rather than making an overt judgment about it. Indeed, Islamic State members who appeared in the film were able to voice their views at length.
As for why Vice News would agree to conditions, he said, the reason was to “gain access to a seemingly impossible situation.”
This article has been updated to identify a questioner in the audience as journalist Gil Shefler.

Tea industry asked to get into research
Special Correspondent
research and development
Productivity and quality are two of the major challenges before the industry
Government can be a partner, but the tea industry has to come forward. This was the message given by Rajani Ranjan Rashmi, Additional Secretary, Union Commerce Ministry, while addressing the 131st annual general meeting of the Indian Tea Association (ITA). He said that productivity and quality were two of the major challenges before the Indian tea industry which also needed to make an in-depth study on mechanisation, to see whether it would be of any help.
Referring to climate-change, which was affecting the tea industry, he said that there was need to build up research capability to tackle this. “On the issue of funding of the Tea Research Association by the government, I would urge the tea industry to get into research to see how it could manage drought,” he said. On tea auctions, he said that there was need for greater transparency and better democracy on this.
Quality issue
Noting that the small tea growers were now contributing over 30 per cent of India’s tea crop, he said that this was “a challenge for the large industry.”
Tea Board Chairman Siddharth said that quality and safety issues should be addressed. He said that while Indian standards needed to be strengthened, no laws were violated while growing tea.
Referring to the recent Greenpeace report, alleging presence of pesticide in Indian teas, he said that while the Tea Board had given a strong rebuttal, the industry would have to accept the various quality standards to stop “people from pointing fingers”.
ITA Chairman A. N. Singh said that the sharing of welfare costs between the industry and the government was the key to enhancing the industry’s viability and competitiveness. He also said that the Tea Board schemes on replantation should be continued with high outlays.

Renzi attacca Camusso per sfidare il Pd. In Senato la fronda cresce ma  divisaJobs Act, Matteo Renzi licenzia Camusso e manda in soffitta la vecchia sinistra: "Solo ideologia"

Fino in fondo. Fino al punto di non ritorno. Matteo Renzi non detta un comunicato stampa per rispondere a muso duro a Susanna Camusso e dirle più o meno quasi tutto quello che pensa su di lei e sul sindacato, nello specifico sulla Cgil. Non parla a margine di un convegno, lo fa raramente del resto. E non cinguetta nemmeno su twitter, cosa che invece fa sistematicamente. No, stavolta gli serve un video, che è quasi un discorso alla nazione, benché in tono informale e breve: solo due minuti. A Palazzo Chigi il premier parla con i suoi delle nuove polemiche sulla riforma del lavoro che già martedì plana in aula al Senato. Apprende dei nuovi attacchi del segretario della Cgil che parla di sciopero e lo paragona addirittura a Margaret Thatcher, da sempre simbolo internazionale del pugno duro contro i sindacati nell’immaginario della sinistra tradizionale. E quindi decide: fa piazzare una telecamera di fronte alla finestra di Palazzo Chigi che dà sulla Colonna di Marco Aurelio, lì al centro della piazza antistante. Decide e contrattacca. E con la Camusso manda in soffitta la vecchia sinistra, tutto il pacchetto, tutto compreso: la Cgil, la vecchia guardia Pd che minaccia battaglia in Senato e la loro ideologia. E’ il Rubicone dei rapporti tra il nuovo Pd e il suo passato.
“Oggi la Cgil ha deciso di andare all'attacco del governo”, dice il premier, in look ‘camicia bianca’ che gli piace perché accorcia le distanze dal suo pubblico di riferimento. “Il segretario Camusso – continua calmo - ha detto che il governo ha in mente Margaret Thatcher quando si parla del lavoro. Ma quando si parla del lavoro noi non siamo impegnati in uno scontro del passato, ideologico. Noi siamo preoccupati non di Margaret Thatcher, ma di Marta, 28 anni, che non ha la possibilità di avere il diritto alla maternità" perché "in questi anni si sono fatti cittadini di serie A e di serie B". Ma non si ferma qui. “Noi quando pensiamo al mondo del lavoro non pensiamo a Margaret Thatcher”, ma “a quelli a cui non ha pensato nessuno in questi anni, che vivono di co.co.pro. e co.co.co e che sono condannati a un precariato a cui il sindacato ha contribuito preoccupandosi solo dei diritti di qualcuno e non di tutti”.
Quindi, l’affondo: “A quei sindacati che vogliono contestarci" io "chiedo: dove eravate in questi anni quando si è prodotta la più grande ingiustizia, tra chi il lavoro ce l'ha e chi no, tra chi ce l'ha a tempo indeterminato e chi precario" perché "si è pensato a difendere solo le battaglie ideologiche e non i problemi concreti della gente”.
L’accusa è quasi personale. Nel mirino c’è la Camusso, appunto. Ma l’immaginario tracciato è più ampio. Renzi parla a tutta la vecchia sinistra che si prepara a scendere in piazza per difendere l’articolo 18, ai bersaniani che minacciano la presentazione di “emendamenti” alla legge delega sul lavoro in Senato (lo annuncia oggi Pierluigi Bersani), parla a tutti i dissidenti Pd ma traccia una parabola più ampia: volta a disegnare il nuovo partito che ha in mente, il modello che ha sempre indicato e che ora, da Palazzo Chigi e dalla segreteria, mette in pratica. Perché l’affondo contro ‘Camusso & Co.’ viene sferrato all’indomani dell’ok alla legge delega da parte della Commissione Lavoro del Senato e alla vigilia dell’approdo in aula. Per giunta, proprio mentre a Palazzo Madama si organizza la fronda dei dissidenti Dem che sulla carta sarebbe più grossa dei 16 dissidenti emersi con la riforma costituzionale quest’estate. Perché oltre a Corradino Mineo (che ha già annunciato il suo no anche nel caso in cui il governo porrà la fiducia sul Jobs Act), oltre ai civatiani (pure loro vicini al no anche in caso di fiducia), ci sono altri gruppi critici: tra bersaniani, i dalemiani, i cuperliani, i Giovani Turchi. In tutto, sarebbero una quarantina di senatori, ma al loro interno ci sono diverse sensibilità.
Se l’ex segretario Pierluigi Bersani minaccia “battaglia” e annuncia la presentazione di “tanti emendamenti” sul Jobs Act, i Giovani Turchi, che stanno in maggioranza con Renzi, non vogliono saperne di “posizionamenti politici interni al partito”. “Noi vogliamo ampliare le tutele contenute nella delega e soprattutto legarla alla legge di stabilità perché lì dovranno essere trovati i fondi per garantire i precari…”, spiega Francesco Verducci. Renzi ovviamente sa di queste differenziazioni interne tra i dissidenti. I suoi scommettono che il grosso rientrerà: “Non romperanno”, dice un parlamentare vicino al premier. Ma per Renzi la cosa non fa differenza. Dal governo cercheranno di lavorare ad una mediazione che però non tocchi i cardini della legge delega. Per intendersi: è difficile che il contratto a tutele crescenti arrivi a maturare la possibilità di reintegro in caso di licenziamento senza giusta causa. Insomma, la sopravvivenza dell’articolo 18 è a serio rischio. “Alle brutte, chi nel Pd non ci sta, farà la scissione”, allarga le braccia un senatore renziano doc.
Ma non si arriverà a quel punto, pensano a Palazzo Chigi. E poi il piano B c’è già, rafforzato dall’ultimo incontro tra Renzi e Silvio Berlusconi mercoledì scorso a Palazzo Chigi . Lo spiega il sottosegretario Graziano Delrio parlando alla festa dei giovani di Fratelli d’Italia ‘Atreju’ e rispondendo ad una domanda su un possibile ‘soccorso azzurro’ da parte di Forza Italia: “ll Parlamento è fatto apposta perché tutti possano contribuire. Certo non è uno scandalo se qualche deputato vota una nostra proposta, ma sono convinto che la nostra maggioranza sarà compatta".
I renziani del giro stretto spiegano che a questo punto l’ipotesi più probabile potrebbe essere quella di votare il Jobs Act senza fiducia e con l’aggiunta dei voti di Forza Italia. E’ tutto da vedere, in vista delle trattative del weekend e della riunione del gruppo Pd al Senato martedì mattina. Ma a Renzi stasera interessava marcare definitivamente il territorio: quello post-ideologico, al di fuori del quale ci sono rottamati e rottamandi. Come la Camusso: metaforicamente (ma nemmeno tanto) licenziata per incapacità.

Ponte sullo stretto di Messina, il "ricatto gentile" di Impregilo a Matteo Renzi: "Se riparte l'opera niente penale"
Gabriella Cerami, L'Huffington Post
E-mail

Da tempo non se ne sentiva parlare. Fino a quando oggi, dopo un lungo silenzio, è arrivato il ‘ricatto gentile’ di Impregilo a Renzi . In sostanza, la società appaltatrice del Ponte sullo Stretto 'invita' il governo ad aprire i cantieri, ma se questo non avverrà, lo Stato dovrà risarcire alla ditta oltre un miliardo.
“Siamo in contenzioso per il risarcimento, su cui abbiamo pienamente ragione - ha spiegato l’amministratore generale, Pietro Salini – di fronte a una così importante spesa per le penali non sarebbe più intelligente dire 'perché non lo facciamo?'. Se la domanda è: 'Noi siamo disponibili a rinunciare alle penali se si fa il Ponte?’. La risposta è: ‘Certo’”. Un ragionamento, quasi una minaccia neanche troppo velata, che entra a forza nella testa del premier.
Pagare le penali o riaprire il dossier della costruzione del Ponte sullo Stretto? È il cruccio di Renzi . A confermare che l'argomento sia all'ordine del giorno è lo stesso Salini, che racconta di averne già discusso con Renzi, il quale - per il momento – non avrebbe però preso alcun impegno con l’azienda né fatto richieste specifiche, almeno secondo quanto viene riferito da Palazzo Chigi. I due però potrebbero incontrarsi presto.
Impregilo, la ditta principale appaltatrice del Ponte, ha già spiegato al premier che sarebbe disposta a rinunciare all'incasso delle penali se Renzi rivalutasse l'idea di realizzare l'opera che collega la Sicilia alla Calabria. Il decreto del governo Monti, quello del dicembre 2012, che aveva messo una pietra tombale sulla grande opera per eccellenza, mettendo anche in liquidazione la Società Stretto di Messina spa, non aveva infatti preso in considerazione che il General contractor Eurolink, il consorzio guidato da Impregilo e da altre società minori, potesse fare ricorso in Tribunale chiedendo il pagamento delle penali.
Al premier, la questione di pagare le penali per la non realizzazione di un’opera, che per di più è stata gestita in tempi passati da altri governi, proprio non va giù. Uno dei mantra della predicazione politico-governativa di Renzi, infatti, è sempre stato: "È assurdo pagare le penali per opere non realizzate". E oggi, Renzi sta facendo un po' di conti. Dai dati si evince infatti che il costo per chiudere definitivamente le procedure riguardanti il Ponte sullo Stretto sarebbe troppo alto per le casse dello Stato.
Il premier, come per le altre opere non realizzate, avrebbe chiesto un report dettagliato sullo stato delle procedure che furono interrotte nel dicembre del 2012 dall’allora premier Monti. La definitiva chiusura di tutte le partite aperte con il General contractor Eurolink comporterebbe allo Stato una spesa pari a 700 milioni di euro (a tanto ammonta la richiesta della società che ha fatto causa allo Stato) e si arriverebbe a oltre un miliardo se si considerano gli oneri finanziari di vario genere e i costi di liquidazione della società ‘Stretto di Messina’.
Cifre alla mano ed economia che non riparte, Renzi sta comunque studiando il modo per evitare di sborsare soldi che non ci sono, al netto del fatto che ancora il Tribunale non si è espresso sul ricorso di Eurolink. Nei giorni scorsi, era anche circolata la voce – smentita da Palazzo Chigi – che il premier avesse chiesto al General contractor un "masterplan" dell'opera, dunque un nuovo progetto meno dispendioso e più in linea con i tempi della Spending review. Sarebbe stato anche un modo per prendere tempo e rinviare il pagamento delle penali.
Comunque sia, l’ad di Impregilo è tornato con insistenza a chiedere la costruzione della grande opera, che da sempre ha rappresentato l’Italia delle divisioni ideologiche, dei berlusconiani e degli antiberlusconiani, dividendo al suo interno la destra e al suo interno la sinistra. “Mi auguro e spero che Renzi riapra il dossier. Si tratta di almeno 40mila posti di lavoro in un'area a forte disoccupazione e di un'opera a basso contributo pubblico rispetto a quello privato. Sia chiaro che cancellare un contratto per legge non può succedere in nessun Paese, ma tra incassi Irpef, Inps, volano delle nuove assunzioni e risparmio delle penali e dei sussidi di disoccupazione il Ponte 'vale' 4,5 miliardi, dei quali meno di 1,5 a carico dello Stato”.
E a fargli eco è arrivato subito il presidente della commissione Lavori pubblici del Senato, il forzista Altero Matteoli, per il quale “Salini fa al governo una proposta seria e generosa. Il governo dovrebbe approfittarne per perseguire l'interesse generale e per rimediare ad un madornale errore di Monti”. Che sia un tema caro all’ex ministro è risaputo, tanto che nel 2008, da capo del dicastero dei Trasporti, aveva annunciato per l’anno seguente l’inizio della costruzione del Ponte, ma è altrettanto certo che il dibattuto ‘Ponte sì-Ponte no’ è destinato a tornare sulla scena politica. E a dividere.

REITs must deliver double-digit returnsRUBI ARYA, Vice-Chairperson & Director, Milestone Capital Advisors
Buying ‘A’ grade commercial property and maintaining it are essential for high returns
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) have to offer higher returns over safe investments to make them attractive to investors, says Rubi Arya, Vice-Chairperson & Director, Milestone Capital Advisors, a real estate private equity firm.
She shares her views on what drives returns in commercial properties — the assets that REITs will hold once they are launched — based on her experience from managing two commercial property income funds.
What attributes do you use to shortlist an asset for purchase? 
Location of the property, its demand-supply scenario, tenancy status and current yields are the attributes used to qualify an asset for purchase.
Commercial properties, especially retail and multi-purpose formats, offer a lot of scope for other income from advertising sales and space selling on temporary basis.
This can offset a fair bit of operating costs for the asset and are hence important.  
As the quality of tenants is important in valuing a property, how do you evaluate them?
We look at details such as how long the tenants have occupied the property and whether they will be expanding their operations.
The nature of the business is important to evaluate if the sector is expected to do well. The cash flow position of the tenants is critical too, as it shows their ability to pay rents on time. And if the tenant has spent money on fit-outs, then they are unlikely to vacate the property in the short term. Lastly, we also visit the premises to see how well they maintain the property.
How do you ensure that the building retains its appeal?
For all our commercial properties, we outsource maintenance to International Property Consultants (IPCs) such as Knight Frank, JLL or Cushman & Wakefield, who bring with them many years of experience in property management. Additionally, we have a dedicated in-house team at Milestone that closely coordinates with the IPCs to supervise maintenance.
In the last five-10 years, how have the rental returns and price appreciation been in the commercial segment?
Rental yields in the commercial segment depend on the quality of tenants and their lease terms. Metro cities have generated yields of 9-11 per cent per annum owing to the higher cost of acquisition and construction. Smaller cities, such as Pune, Gurgaon and Rajkot, have generated double-digit rental yields. This apart, capital appreciation has been in the range of 3-3.5 per cent per annum.
That puts total returns in the 12 per cent range. Is this enough to attract REIT investors?
Worldwide, REITs have been successful in places where comparable benchmark rates are low. For instance, in Singapore, government bond yields are 3-4 per cent and fixed deposit rates are at 1-2 per cent, while REITs has a big market, providing around 6 per cent returns.
India’s benchmark bond yield hovers just a notch lower than 9 per cent. So, for India to have a robust REIT market, returns will need to be higher for investors to overlook property, currency and developer-associated risks.
Indicate some good locations and property types that one can consider?
The demand for acquiring leased out grade ‘A’ commercial properties has already started picking up and there is growing interest to own hospitality and healthcare properties. The top three cities for commercial realty are Delhi-NCR, Mumbai and Bangalore.
Delhi and NCR buyers have recently earned a return of 10-12 per cent from the day the capital is invested even if the property is under construction.
In Gurgaon and Noida, the demand for commercial space is expected to increase, but greater supply may limit growth in rentals.
In Mumbai, office space demand is primarily from the banking, financial services and insurance and software. So far, sufficient supply of office space has kept this segment exciting for occupiers as well as investors. With limited future supply in prime locations, rent is expected to go up in the next couple of quarters.
The Bangalore market is set to witness demand for offices and retail in both the central business districts and in the suburbs and peripheral areas.
Additionally, rental and capital value of retail shops is expected to increase across malls in Bangalore.

Government-funded start-up insurer Land of Lincoln Health changes leadership for year 2 of Obamacare enrollmen
Land of Lincoln Health, the startup insurer funded in part by a $160 million federal loan, is shuffling its leadership team ahead of the start of open enrollment in the second year of the Affordable Care Act.
The Chicago-based insurance cooperative, which is affiliated with the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council, plans to announce Monday that Chief Executive Officer Daniel Yunker will step aside from day-to-day operations to take on additional responsibilities with the council. The move is effective Sept. 30.
Jason Montrie, who was formerly executive vice president of Land of Lincoln, will be elevated to president, taking the lead on the insurer's strategic and operational functions.
Yunker, 45, was appointed president and CEO of the council, replacing Kevin Scanlan, 65, who will retire.
Yunker was previously a senior vice president of the council. He will retain his CEO title at Land of Lincoln, focusing primarily on the insurer's relationships with hospitals and provider groups.
In an interview Friday, Yunker said the move was planned previously as part of the council's succession planning. He said he's excited about the opportunity to lead the organization, which directly represents all 89 acute-care hospitals in the eight-county metro area and 150 hospitals and health care providers throughout Illinois, southern Wisconsin and northwest Indiana.
"Our vision is for Chicago to be among the best, if not the best, health care market in the country," Yunker said. "My focus will be on what things we can do to deliver value to the health care community and consumers to meet that vision."

Lampard stuns Chelsea; Leicester shock Man UnitedChelsea's Eden Hazard (L) challenges Manchester City's Edin Dzeko during …
By Mike Collett
LONDON (Reuters) - Chelsea icon Frank Lampard scored for Manchester City to end his old club's perfect start to the Premier League season while Leicester City came from 3-1 down to beat Manchester United 5-3 on a remarkable day in the Premier League on Sunday.
Lampard, Chelsea's record scorer with 211 goals in his 13 years at Stamford Bridge came on as a late substitute and scored to earn the 10-man champions a 1-1 draw against the league leaders but did not celebrate the goal and was later applauded off the pitch by both sets of fans.
Earlier United led 2-0 then 3-1 with 33 minutes to play, but ended up beaten 5-3 in a game that will live on as one of promoted Leicester's most unlikely victories.
But the shocks did not stop there with West Bromwich Albion winning 1-0 at Tottenham Hotspur for their first league win of the season while Crystal Palace, also without a league win, came from behind to beat Everton 3-2 at Goodison Park as both losers suffered Europa League hangovers.
After the dust settled, Chelsea remained top with 13 points from their five matches, followed by Southampton and Aston Villa on 10 points.
Manchester City were 1-0 down to Andre Schurrle's 71st minute far post tap-in following a swift break and down to 10 men after the 66th-minute dismissal of Pablo Zabaleta.
Lampard then joined the fray and converted a James Milner cross in typical style.
"It's a really difficult one. I'd be unprofessional if I came on and didn't do my job so I'm mixed with it," he told Sky Sports.
"The Chelsea fans were singing my name and it was an emotional day. It's not how I expected to say goodbye to the Chelsea fans. I woke up this morning and didn't know what I wanted from today so I'm glad it's out of the way. I guess this is a happy medium."
UNITED COLLAPSE
United also ended with 10 men but no points despite racing 2-0 ahead with a header from Robin van Persie and a brilliant chip from Angel di Maria.
Leonardo Ulloa pulled one back but United looked safe when Ander Herrera back-heeled their third after 57 minutes.
However, Leicester roared back with a David Nugent penalty, an equaliser from Esteban Cambiasso a fourth from Jamie Vardy and a fifth with an Ulloa penalty seven minutes from time, when United defender Tyler Blackett was sent off.
"It was absolutely brilliant," said man-of-the-match Vardy.
"We had done our research this week and their attacking options are frightening but the diamond formation they play leaves a lot of space behind the full backs and we looked to exploit that," he said.
United had beaten Leicester in nine of their last 10 league meetings and drawn the other and their stunned manager Louis van Gaal told the BBC: "In the world of football, these matches happen. I was a coach at Barcelona in my first year and we were 3-0 ahead, with 15 minutes to play and we lost 3-4.
"It is not good because we have the game in our pocket and gave it away. Not because of Leicester, we gave it away and I don't like that."

Health Canada asks Ipca to stop ingredients shipment
P T Jyothi Datta
USFDA detected data manipulation by the company
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
Just months after Ipca voluntarily stopped the export of pharmaceutical ingredients to the United States, the drugmaker has been asked by Health Canada to stop similar shipments to Canada as well.
Health Canada has taken the precautionary step of asking Ipca Laboratories in India to voluntarily stop shipment of products to Canada based on a review of a recent good manufacturing practices (GMP) inspection report by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) where they identified falsification and manipulation of data issues at the company, the regulator said.
“Ipca had not disputed the FDA findings with Health Canada,” it said, adding that the FDA has not issued a recall of any of the affected products.
In July, Ipca had voluntarily stopped exporting active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from its Ratlam plant in Madhya Pradesh to the US following regulatory observations made by the US regulator.
Health Canada recent directive covers about 21 APIs. The department has also asked Canadian companies that import products containing APIs from the Ipca facilities to temporarily quarantine these products, it added.
Since there is no indication that the issues identified during the FDA inspection pose a risk to health, the Canadian regulator said that it was not requesting a recall of products already on the market. But that could change if the situation changes, it added.
The developments in Canada come even as drugmakers like Ranbaxy and Wockhardt grapple with USFDA scrutiny on several of their plants. More recently, even Sun Pharma has been facing regulatory issues at some of its plants.
Regulators collaborate
As regulators around the world share information and inspection reports, Health Canada said it would continue to work with other international regulatory partners, Canadian importers and Ipca, to gather more information about the products involved.
The information being sought includes any additional testing being done, the medical necessity of the products involved, their market share, and risk assessments, it said.
The process could take a few weeks to complete given the complexity of efforts, it said, adding that the voluntary quarantine would continue until the department was satisfied that adequate measures were in place to confirm the quality of the products from these facilities.

Sensex up 116 points; consumer durables  FMCG stocks steal the showSensex up 116 points; consumer durables, FMCG stocks steal the show
Our Bureau/Agencies
Mumbai, Sept 22:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the green amid weak European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex rose 116.32 points or 0.43 per cent at 27,206.74 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty gained 24.85 points or 0.31 per cent at 8,146.30.
Rajesh Agarwal, Head-Research, Eastern Financiers, in a report said: "Going forward, the Sensex earnings multiple at 17 times FY15 earnings looks a bit stretched, and investors would be better off being cautious as the near term upside looks a little difficult. Some reforms have taken place but the quantum of impact on the bottom-line of corporates needs to be seen. Hot money, lower crude prices, monsoon not turning out to be as bad as was earlier expected, are some of the factors that are driving the markets. While we believe that markets could witness correction in short-term, earnings expansion, government initiatives towards infrastructure and strengthening economic data, provide comfort on the medium-term. We strongly believe that the Government’s pro-growth approach will aid the revival in the economy and would in turn boost equity markets."
Among BSE sectoral indices, consumer durables, FMCG, auto and oil & gas indices were the star-performers and were up 3.12 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.88 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, metal index fell the most by 1.22 per cent, followed by healthcare 0.89 per cent and India infrastructure 0.87 per cent.
Tata Motors, ONGC, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and SBIN were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Cipla, BHEL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Infosys.
Concerns over a slowdown in China hammered stocks and commodities on Monday, while signs of differences between major economic powers on the need to stimulate growth further clouded the outlook.
Asian shares fell as investors worried a key measure of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
The slide was carried over into Europe, where fears over Chinese demand hit miners' shares. A further profit warning from British supermarket Tesco, whose shares fell 8 per cent, also took its toll.
Adding to the sense of gloom in markets, Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting in Australia at the weekend said they were close to adding $2 trillion to the global economy, though there were signs of disagreement.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 347.48 at 10:02 a.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.6 per cent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts slid 0.5 per cent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.8 per cent.

The Fed s Schizophreniareddit
Last week the Federal Reserve decided to curtail its purchases of securities after October bringing to an end its long experiment with quantitative easing (QE), presumably because it is more bullish on the economy. But the Fed also said it will continue to hold interest rates at zero indefinitely suggesting it is still bearish on the economy. The Fed's economic forecast was in fact marked down to less than 3 percent for the next several years. Perhaps the best term to describe the Fed's attitude is schizophrenic.
I for one will shed no tears for QE, which has troubled me as it morphed into a never-ending monetary stimulus program. QE1 was born in December 2008 in response to the banking crisis. The Fed began buying longer-term securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). The Fed said it would buy up to $100 billion of the GSEs' debt and up to $500 billion of their MBS from banks and the GSEs themselves. The goal was to pump more money into the economy, shore up the banking system and boost the nation out of recession.
But the recession lingered so in November 2010 the Fed launched QE2 saying it would buy $75 billion of longer-termed securities a month. The economy remained weak. Then in September 2012 the Fed began QE3 increasing purchases to $85 billion a month. By then the economy was growing again, albeit sporadically. This year the Fed has been reducing its buying of debt to about $35 billion per month. So far the overall tab is $2.3 trillion in long-term treasuries and $1.7 trillion in GSE securities -- a total of $4 trillion.
These Fed actions have enabled the banks to amass reserves of $2.6 trillion which means they could create up to $26 trillion in new money. Of course, a major goal of the Fed is to encourage the banks to lend more readily, thus stimulating economic growth and creating jobs. But this effort has not thus far proven very successful. Meanwhile, the Fed's actions have destabilized the economy by encouraging risky behavior, such as excessive speculation in the stock market, a flood of IPOs, more mergers than can be justified economically and a general distortion of our capital markets.
Even though the Fed is moving to reduce its purchase of bonds, it indicates it will keep interest rates at near zero indefinitely. Fed Chairman Janet Yellen is clearly more concerned about slow growth and modest labor market gains than about inflation or increased financial instability.
In sum, the Fed is determined to continue its efforts to promote economic growth and job creation come what may. That is a laudable goal but it is politically risky. Given that the Fed exists outside the normal political process, it may lead to a strong reaction if and when inflation rears its ugly head again or we encounter a new financial crisis as our government tries to cope with all of that new debt the Fed has acquired.

UK visa: When  Ruby  from Mumbai seeks fake gay marriageprint
A new crime sub-category has emerged in Britain after same-sex marriages were made legal in March: fake marriages between same-sex couples for a fee that enables a non-EU citizen skirt strict visa rules and stay in the country after ‘marrying’ a UK/EU citizen.
Organised gangs provide a man or woman for an all-expenses fee of 10,000 pounds, so that the non-EU citizen can enter into the fake marriage. Registrars and immigration officials are said to be struggling to stop such marriages.
The usual modus operandi of such ‘marriages’ is that after it is registered, the two individuals go their separate ways, and file for divorce after the non-EU citizen gets permission to stay in the country after the mandatory period.
In the past, several Indian citizens were arrested for being part of such fake but different sex marriages. After March, when same-sex marriages became legal, there are no reports yet of Indians being involved in such fake marriages.
However, a BBC sting operation telecast on Monday shows an Asian undercover reporter being given the name of ‘Ruby’ from Mumbai by a gang member, who organised the fake marriage, so that she could stay in the country. ‘Ruby’ posed as an illegal immigrant urgently seeking a fake marriage to stay in the UK, while another posed as her uncle.
The gang offered two potential fake Romanian brides to the reporter, both of whom explicitly stated they were not lesbians but were willing to pretend to be gay and marry anyone for cash. Romania joined the EU in 2007, and from January this year, UK lifted temporary restrictions on them to move here.
Peter and Ricardo, the gang's leaders, boasted to the undercover reporters they had ‘fixed’ weddings ‘lots of times’, while one of the girls, Alexandra, said she had previously organised six fake weddings and knew how to deceive immigration officers.
She says in the undercover footage: "We have to declare we live together… That's not gonna happen but that's what we have to declare." She said she could also arrange a "romantic" photo-shoot of the undercover reporter and herself, designed to persuade the authorities that they were in a genuine relationship.
Mark Rimmer, head of Registration and Nationality Services in the London borough of Brent, told BBC: "Here in Brent, the Home Office stops marriages on a weekly basis…I think it is probably more difficult to spot the signs if you have a same sex couple whether they be male or female."
Minister for Immigration and Security, James Brokenshire, said the sting had uncovered disturbing evidence, and added: "Registrars will be given new powers later this year to better identify all fraudulent marriages."

McMonopoly Is Back 9/23reddit
McDonald's goes to the McWell one more time tomorrow, kicking off another round of its Monopoly game promotion. Actually, a Pre-Promotion Sweepstakes lasts for one week beginning September 23, with the full Monopoly game set to launch on September 30. Menus are not the only thing that McDonald's is capable of over-complicating.
For the Pre-Promotion Sweepstakes, consumers are urged to Like McDonald's on Facebook or follow it on Twitter because a special free Code will be given via those channels. Go from social media to PlayatMcD.com for a chance to win $10,000.
With full-tilt Monopoly, consumers can win $1,000,000 (payable as $50,000 per year over 20 years) or one of several new prizes, including a Dream Trip through Delta Vacations, a Beaches Resorts vacation, a Cessna Private Jet Trip (destination to be determined) and $2,500 with a smartphone equipped with Mobile Wallet. The Free Parking game piece could be worth $100,000.
There may never have been more pressure to succeed than this version of Monopoly carries. A year ago, U.S. same-store sales were up +0.7% thanks to Monopoly as well as the Mighty Wings launch. Since then the largest restaurant chain in the world has had difficulty posting positive quarterly reports for U.S. sales. For August, U.S. comp sales were -3.7%, the worst decline in more than a decade. McDonald's would gladly take a 0.7% gain for September and/or October.
Last October, McDonald's Corp. President-CEO Don Thompson lauded Monopoly as a way to focus attention on core classic menu items such as the Big Mac or Chicken McNuggets. Further,  it "drives traffic and builds average check while also engaging customers in a fun and familiar game experience that's only available at McDonald's," Thompson told analysts then. The company certainly is hoping that Monopoly can work that kind of business magic one more time.

New Zealand's Commercial Approvals Bureau has said, "No, no, never, never" to Carl's Jr.'s suggestive TV commercial for its Texas BBQ Thickburger. The "I Love Texas" spot--with model Hannah Ferguson wearing a black-leather sorta swimsuit and sudsing up a grimy truck in a barn plus a special cameo by Paris Hilton--won't be seen on TV in New Zealand. Of course, every young Kiwi worth his Thickburger has already seen the spot on YouTube a few times and has been irrevocably corrupted.
--------------
In February 2011, McDonald's gained credence in France for its commitment to local food sourcing when it launched a snack-size burger made with local Charolais beef. Now the chain is back with not one but two more French cattle breeds.
As part of a "Les Viandes de Nos Regions" (Our Regional Meats) campaign, McDonald's has created a full-size Charolais burger and introduced another burger made with Normande beef from Normandy and a third with Montbéliard beef from the region of that name.
The "Le  Normand" burger has French Emmental cheese, lettuce and mustard sauce and is served on a new cross-hatched bun. The "Le Montbéliard" has an onion sauce instead.
--------------
Speaking of buns, McDonald's continues to explore alternatives, at least overseas. In Denmark the chain introduced Big Ciabatta burgers (beef or chicken) on ciabatta rolls not seen here. These have bacon, Monterey Jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, red pepper, grilled onions and a peppery barbecue sauce.
In Spain it introduced "Los Irresistibles": The double-patty Little Italy and Soho BBQ burgers on seeded buns. Marketing materials describe the latter burger as a "delicious combination of flavors from one of the most cosmopolitan and creative neighborhoods: Soho." McDonald's love for naming overseas menu items after New York City neighborhoods continues as well.

Congress  NCP leaders to meet tomorrow to resolve seat-sharingtanglePrint
PTI | Mumbai | Posted: September 22, 2014 8:34 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 8:37 pm
With less than a week left for nominations to close for Maharashtra Assembly polls, top Congress and NCP leaders will meet here tomorrow in a last ditch attempt to resolve the seat-sharing deadlock and salvage the 15-year-old alliance.
NCP’s Core Committee chaired by party chief Sharad Pawar went into a huddle here this afternoon where it reaffirmed that the alliance should continue but insisted on getting a larger share of the state’s 288 Assembly seats than 124 offered by Congress.
“Congress should be practical and we expect an open dialogue to find a solution to this deadlock. Time is running out for both of us as the last date of filing of nomination papers in September 27,” senior party leader Praful Patel told reporters after the meeting.
Patel said Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and Ahmed Patel, Political Secretary to Congress President Sonia Gandhi called him up yesterday and told him about their engagements in Delhi. They suggested that talks be held tomorrow, he said.
“It was decided that tommorrow at 10 AM Ajit Pawar (Deputy CM), Sunil Tatkare (state NCP Chief), senior leader Chhagan Bhujbal and myself will meet Congress leaders led by the Chief Minister and discuss seat-sharing. We expect Congress to discuss beyond 124 seats which we contested in 2004,” he said.
“The offer of 124 seats is unacceptable to us,” he said, adding NCP’s demand for increased number of seats stays.
NCP had contested 114 and Congress 174 in 2009 Assembly polls and has been insisting on fielding candidates in half of the 288 seats, citing it had double the number of Lok Sabha seats in the state than Congress. In worst-ever performance for the ruling alliance, NCP had won 4 LS seats against Congress’ 2.
Tomorrow’s meeting will be the first between the leaders of the two allies after Sharad Pawar had met Sonia Gandhi on August 6.
Patel also trashed reports suggesting that NCP could go with BJP after the polls.
“Mispropoganda against NCP is not right. We don’t have any other agenda. It’s our right to grow politically. Why accuse us of having an agenda. NCP has been the most loyal and responsible ally of Congress in the state and the Centre. Our conduct has been exemplary,” he said.
Patel said after meeting Congress leaders tommorrow, NCP will discuss the details within the party in the presence of Sharad Pawar and then a final call will be taken.
When asked if the stalemate will be resolved by tommorrow when it has not happened till now, Patel said,” In politics, things always happen at the eleventh hour.”
He, however, chose not to quantify the final number of seats NCP was ready to accept, saying, “We have the barometer of our self respect.”
He said, “We will take a decision which will be in our interest and that of the state. In 2004, we were the single-largest party and gave up the Chief Minister’s post because Congress insisted.”
Responding to a question on whether the Congress-NCP alliance was dependent on the fate of Sena-BJP relations, Patel said his party had nothing continued…

MUMBAI: Luxury super sports car maker Automobili Lamborghini rolled out a new sports car, Huracan LP610-4 today, priced at Rs 3.43 crore (ex-showroom price in Delhi), whose deliveries are scheduled to begin next month.
"Today, we are very proud to officially launch the new Lamborghini Huracan LP 610-4 here in India. Automobili Lamborghini continues to set new benchmarks in the luxury super sports car industry and, we expect the Huracan to be well received in this country," Automobili Lamborghini's Head of South East Asia Sebastian Henry said.
Presently, the Italian auto maker sells models like Gallardo as well as Aventador in the local market, and the Huracan LP610-4 is the replacement for Gallardo.
With its name inspired by the Spanish sport of bullfighting, the Huracan is designed to be bold and edgy, while its exterior incorporates LED-lighting technology.
When asked about the company's sales target for the current year, Henry said no target has been set for this year, but 2015 is expected to be a better year in terms of growth.
"This year is the year of transition and cannot be compared, but next year we will have a full year. So 2015 will be interesting to compare with," he said.
Owned by Audi AG, Lamborghini has sold 22 cars in India, through its two exclusive dealerships, one each in Delhi and Mumbai.
Henry said the company would set up its third outlet in Bangalore by this year.
"The Huracan is expected to become a legend in the future. Since its global launch at the Geneva Motor Show, customer response has been very positive. Deliveries of these units are scheduled to begin in October 2014," Lamborghini India's Head of Operations Pavan Shetty said.

Maharashtra BJP divided over allianceUpdated: September 23, 2014 03:30 IST
Plan B ready, says Modi’s Maharashtra troubleshooter

Om Mathur, BJP-in-charge of Maharashtra polls.

alliances and coalition
Plan B if ‘respectable’ share of seats not given
As tension over seat-sharing with ally Shiv Sena continues, there seems to be a sharp division in the BJP’s top Maharashtra leadership on keeping the alliance.
Though the BJP has taken the public stance that it “wants to keep” the 25-year-old alliance going, there is talk of a ‘plan B’ if the Shiv Sena does not give the BJP a “respectable” share of seats.
If the deadlock is not resolved, “it’s natural, for both sides,” to put into action ‘plan B,’ Om Mathur, BJP-in-charge of Maharashtra polls, told The Hindu.
‘Time will tell’
In case talks fail, “time will tell” the next course of action, Mr. Mathur said, leaving open all options.
Considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Mathur, however, reiterated that the party “wants to continue the alliance”.
“The Sena has not formally responded to our proposal. We are waiting for their response,” he said.
Maharashtra BJP split over parting ways with Sena
With Sept. 26, the last date for filing nominations for the Maharashtra Assembly elections nearing, the State BJP leaders are eagerly waiting for a direction from the central leadership.
The deadlock in the seat-sharing talks has triggered speculation that the parties could go their separate ways after being together for a quarter century.
The State BJP unit seems to be divided on the pros and cons of fighting without the Sena, with a section of leaders irritated by the long-time ally’s “stubborn” behaviour.
“The Sena is unnecessarily insisting on contesting more seats. We are only asking for a discussion on those 59 seats that it has never won. We want to keep the alliance but if we are kept at 119 you can consider the alliance as good as over. “It’s about self-respect after all,” said a senior leader.
The faction in favour of splitting believes that the party is equipped to go it alone despite the shortage of time.
“The party is ready. The development agenda of Mr. Modi is conducive for us to run alone,” said the leader.
He, however, admitted that going it alone at this moment would put the party at a “little disadvantage.”
However, the argument for running solo seems to be half-hearted. Though some leaders believe that the party missed an opportunity by not declaring to go solo after the Lok Sabha elections, they believe it is now “too late” for a breakup.
“For 25 years you do business, you can’t leave it at the last moment. It will send the wrong message to voters and prove detrimental for both sides,” said a senior leader. Clearly they do not want to cross the line as is evident from their restrained statements on the public challenge thrown by the Sena.

Mars Mission a step closer to success  Isro successfully test-fires Mangalyaan engineSet for date with Mars, Mangalyaan in 'good health'
Vanita Srivastava , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 22, 2014
First Published: 15:50 IST(22/9/2014) | Last Updated: 05:26 IST(24/9/2014)
Indian scientists on Monday successfully tested the main engine of the country’s Mars mission spacecraft and completed a course correction that put the probe on track to enter the red planet’s orbit on September 24.
 
If successful, India will become the first country to make it to Mars in its maiden attempt, propelling it to an elite club of space race leaders. Only the US, Europe and Russia have so far sent probes that have successfully orbited or landed on the planet.
“We had a perfect burn for four seconds as programmed. The trajectory has been corrected. MOM (Mars Orbiter Mission) will now go for the nominal plan for Mars Orbit Insertion,” the Indian Space Research Organisation’s Facebook page said.
 
The liquid engine, which was dormant for 300 days, will be used with eight small thrusters during orbit entry by the spacecraft in India’s first interplanetary mission.
 
“The spacecraft is in good health. Mission controllers are going through the final round of the sequence of operations,” ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan told HT, adding that there was a lot more to do.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be at Isro’s command centre in Bengaluru at 7.30am on September 24 to witness the mission’s last phase after the probe broke into Mars’ sphere of influence on Monday.

The Mangalyaan, as the spacecraft is popularly known, aims to study Mars' surface and mineral composition, and search its atmosphere for methane, a chemical strongly tied to life on earth.
Video: Mangalyaan’s real test on Sept 24: Former scientist Biman Basu?
India’s Rs. 450-crore expedition cost about a tenth of Nasa’s Mars mission Maven that entered the red planet’s orbit on Wednesday. Modi hailed the project’s low price tag in June, saying it was less than the budget of the Hollywood space movie Gravity.
 
“I hope India will consider international participation in any future missions to Mars as this mission will clearly demonstrate its capability to successfully deliver a payload to Mars and many countries would be pleased to collaborate with India,” said Mark Sims, professor of astrobiology and space instrumentation at the UK’s University of Leicester.
 
The 680-million-kilometre journey to Mars that began on November 5 last year has had its share of adventures and feats —five orbit-raising manoeuvres including a small glitch in the fourth such operation that was fixed.
 
Probes to Mars have a high failure rate and a success will boost India’s space exploration programme, especially after a similar mission by China failed to leave earth’s orbit in 2011.
 

NIA seeks MHA nod to register case against ISIS  al Qaeda for hiring Indian youthsPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 22, 2014 8:45 pm | Updated: September 23, 2014 1:57 am
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has sought the permission of the Ministry of Home Affairs to file a case against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
Following reports of Indian youths joining ISIS, the NIA is said to have suggested that an “open case” under provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and the UN Convention on terrorism could be filed against ISIS for brainwashing youths into committing acts of terror.
“We are still deliberating the specific sections under which the case would be registered. The Home Ministry is to take a final call on it,” a senior NIA official said.

Since the group has not committed any crime in India, the Home Ministry is exploring the possibility of registering the case under some preparatory sections, such as Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.
The section states: “Whoever conspires or attempts to commit, or advocates, abets, advises or incites or knowingly facilitates the commission of a terrorist act or any act preparatory to the commission of a terrorist act, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.”

Scientists create a Star of David molecule -- a step towards molecular chainmailBy Rachel Feltman September 22 Follow @rachelfeltman

Scientists at the University of Manchester have created a new molecular shape -- a group of interlocking rings, twisted into a six-pointed "Star of David." But they weren't inspired by the shape's religious symbolism: The molecule, reported Sunday in Nature Chemistry , is the most complex molecular shape ever created in the lab.
Interwoven molecules like this one could be used to create some pretty cool new materials. "When you look at viruses, some of their shells have these coatings made of a sort of chainmail of protein, and it's very tough but very light," lead researcher and professor of chemistry David Leigh said. "So the thinking is that if you could do the same thing with a man-made molecule, you could get those same benefits."
But learning how to make interweaving molecules is a challenge, Leigh said -- one that chemists have been working at for over 25 years. The trick his team used was to let the molecules assemble themselves.
"Most have tried to take linear molecules and twist them around each other," Leigh said, "But we choose our building blocks very carefully."
The shape is made of two molecular triangles that interweave with each other three times, creating a star with a perimeter of only 114 atoms . Instead of having to bend the triangles into place, the chemists chose triangles that would interweave on their own as they formed. "Nature does the same thing to assemble the double helix in DNA," Leigh said.
But a single star is not a suit of armor, so Leigh and his team will continue to work on more complex molecular shapes -- and eventually, they'll try to form the chains and sheets of interlocking shapes that will form our modern-day chainmail.

Is there a right to contribute to out-of-state electionsBy Will Baude September 22
Josh Blackman links to an interesting new speech by (retired) Justice Stevens about the Court’s campaign finance jurisprudence. Among other things, Justice Stevens argues that there ought to be little protection (or no protection?) for campaign contributions made across state lines. He begins . . .:
In the first sentence of his controlling opinion [in McCutcheon v. FEC] the Chief Justice correctly states that there “is no right more basic to our democracy than the right to participate in electing our political leaders.” 188 L. Ed.2d 468, 482. And in his concluding paragraph he correctly describes that right as “the First Amendment right of citizens to choose who shall govern them.” Id., at 507 (Emphases added).
McCutcheon’s complaint, however, makes it clear that his objection to the federal statute was based entirely on its impairment of his ability to influence the election of political leaders for whom he had no right to vote. He is an Alabama citizen; in the 2012 election cycle he made equal contributions to different candidates, only two of whom were from Alabama. The other thirteen were campaigning in California, Ohio, Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. Of primary significance is the fact that his only complaint about the federal statute was its prohibition against his making contributions in 2014 to candidates in twelve other non-Alabama elections – Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Minnesota, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin.
To the best of my knowledge in none of the Court’s cases prior to McCutcheon has the Court even mentioned a citizen’s supposed right to participate in elections in which he or she has no right to vote. It surely has not characterized it as a “basic right” of unparalleled importance.
Among other things, Justice Stevens draws on Bluman v. FEC , an opinion by Judge Kavanaugh that held that non-resident aliens had no right to make contributions or expenditures about American elections, and that was summarily affirmed (unanimously!) by the Supreme Court.
This is an interesting point, although I am not at all convinced by Justice Stevens’s analysis. For a different take, here is an excerpt from Jessica Bulman-Pozen’s recent article, Partisan Federalism :
Bluman v. FEC: Political Engagement Across State Lines
In recent years, political engagement across state lines has increased dramatically. This engagement is not limited to out-of-state spending for federal representatives, but also extends to state electoral contests and referenda. In the 2012 Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election, for instance, out-of-state contributions made up a majority of Governor Scott Walker’s arsenal and nearly a third of challenger Tom Barrett’s funds. For South Dakota’s 2006 referendum on abortion, a substantial majority of the funds for both sides came from other states. As one commentator puts it: “Means of communication, fundraising and also campaigning are becoming national–and it’s affecting state and even local races.”
Cross-state engagement furnishes powerful evidence of partisan federalism. For one thing, party organizations are among the most active cross-state participants; the Democratic and Republican Governors Associations have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into state races in the past decade.261 Party actors recognize the power of the states as platforms for national conflict. But so too do individuals, who get involved directly in out-of-state politics for many reasons. In some cases, a donor might contemplate moving to a different state to take advantage of a new policy or visiting to benefit from the policy during a briefer stay. In other cases, one state’s decisions may effectively set policy for the entire nation. But in perhaps the largest number of cases, Americans do not stand to benefit immediately or directly from out-of-state political involvement. Instead, they seek to create momentum for a particular policy or political party, to build a real-life example to inform national debate, or simply to take comfort in knowing that their preferences are actual policy–and their partisan group is in control– somewhere. By channeling money toward states other than their own and embracing the kind of surrogate representation I have explored in Part III, these individuals are enacting partisan federalism.
If we see cross-state political participation, however, it is not because existing federalism doctrine or theory supports the practice. Instead, it is because such activity has been protected as expression under the First Amendment. Today, only Alaska and Hawaii impose any limits on out-of-state contributions, and no state limits out-of-state expenditures. Although the Alaska Supreme Court upheld the state’s residency-based limits, citing “deep suspicions of the motives and wisdom of those who, from outside its borders, wish to remold Alaska,” federal courts have rejected, on First Amendment grounds, attempts by other states to impose similar restrictions. Courts have also largely invalidated–as inconsistent with the First Amendment–state requirements that petition circulators be state residents. While these courts have focused on the expressive dimensions of cross-border contributions and expenditures and have not considered their validity from a federalism perspective, a recent case raises the question of whether such expressive activity undermines American federalism and may accordingly be proscribed. In Bluman v. FEC, a three-judge panel of the D.C. District Court took up a loose end left by the Supreme Court’s holding in Citizens United v. FEC: “whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation’s political process.” In a decision summarily affirmed by the Supreme Court, the court upheld a provision of federal law that prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions or expenditures in connection with federal, state, or local elections. The court reasoned that the case did not turn on the First Amendment questions that have dominated campaign finance jurisprudence but rather a “foundational question about the definition of the American political community.” “It is fundamental to the definition of our national political community,” the court maintained, “that foreign citizens do not have a constitutional right to participate in, and thus may be excluded from, activities of democratic self-government.” Recognizing political contributions and expenditures as integral to electoral processes, the court proceeded to define them as both speech and participation in democratic self-government. Accordingly, it reasoned, limitations on foreign contributions and expenditures are “all ‘part of the sovereign’s obligation to preserve the basic conception of a political community.”’
By moving from the speech-based logic of Citizens United and its precursors to a speaker-based logic, Bluman has recast the question of whether states may ban contributions and expenditures by nonresidents. After Bluman, it is no longer sufficient to define such activity as speech; it is also necessary to define who is speaking and how the speaker relates to the political community. Is it true, as an amicus brief in an earlier case argued, that “from Oregon’s constitutional perspective, a citizen of Florida, Texas, or Vermont has no more of an interest or stake in . . . making campaign contributions in Oregon than does a citizen of Montreal or Mexico City”? Or is it fundamentally misguided to treat Americans from different states as foreigners to one another?
Bluman itself sends mixed signals on this question. In purely doctrinal terms, Bluman makes a strong case for limiting out-of-state financial participation. The opinion cites Gregory v. Ashcroft in support of the proposition that the government may exclude foreigners “from activities ‘intimately related to the process of democratic self-government.”’ Relying in part on the resident alien precedents subsequently cited in Bluman, Gregory maintained that state citizens must be able to determine the qualifications of their government officials free from federal interference in order “to preserve the basic conception of a political community.” Moreover, to the extent that Bluman treats spending money as a form of participation in the process of democratic self-government, Article IV Privileges and Immunities doctrine suggests that states might permissibly restrict nonresidents from making contributions and expenditures. Although Privileges and Immunities jurisprudence is a nationalist strand of federalism jurisprudence, the Court has long reserved to state residents the right to vote and to hold elective office, justifying these restrictions as preserving the states as separate “political” communities and fostering individuals’ “identification with a particular State.” If contributions and expenditures are also forms of democratic participation that shore up political community, this doctrine suggests they too might be activities reserved to state residents.
But if the doctrinal logic of Bluman casts cross-state political participation as a form of foreign participation that may be proscribed, the opinion seems eager to head off just such claims. Responding to the plaintiffs’ argument that contributions and expenditures are not democratic participation akin to voting, as evidenced by the fact that Americans do not vote but do make contributions and expenditures related to elections in states other than their own, the court insisted that citizens of other states are “members of the American political community.” Given particular concerns about “foreign influence,” the court further reasoned, “a law that is justified as applied to aliens may not be justified as applied to citizens of the United States.” In so framing the issue, the court appeared to reject the sort of federalism argument made in litigation about out-of-state contributions and expenditures–namely, that if states are discrete political communities, then out-of-state donors are exerting “foreign influence.” Even as its reasoning points the way to restricting cross-state political participation in order to protect state political communities, Bluman suggests that the relevant political community is the United States, not the fifty states as such. Bluman and existing doctrine ultimately point to two different approaches to cross-state political participation on federalism grounds: either, on a strong federalist logic, states are meaningful political communities and cross-border activity may be proscribed to preserve them as such, or, on a strong nationalist logic, cross-border activity must be permitted because the United States is one national community. We might instead eschew such dichotomous thinking and understand cross-border participation to be consistent with federalism insofar as political participation across state lines reflects and reaffirms the states’ significance as governments and sites of political community. Most narrowly, such participation allows individuals who feel alienated from their own state government to affiliate with another state government. More broadly, it underscores that states serve as opponents of and counterbalances to the federal government for the nation at large. In keeping with Bluman’s dicta, this understanding casts all Americans as members of a national political community. Moving beyond Bluman, it recognizes the states as discrete political communities–but ones that are, in critical respects, discrete national political communities.
One might raise a variety of objections to this defense of cross-border participation. A critique internal to the argument I have offered might run as follows: for states to serve as political counterweights to the federal government and sites of individual partisan identification, they must be meaningfully different from the federal government, but if state elections are shaped by individuals across the nation, we will not see significant divergence. To bolster partisan federalism, we should instead restrict political participation to state residents in order to distinguish the states from the federal government and from one another.
This objection has force. But, I submit, partisan federalism is more consistent with cross-border participation than with its prohibition. Given the restriction of the franchise to state residents and a population unevenly distributed across fifty states, cross-state engagement will not eliminate partisan diversity across states and the federal government. Already today Americans participate in political contests beyond their states of residence, and the states do not mirror either the federal government or one another. On the other side of the balance, allowing people across the nation to contribute money and time to political contests in states other than their own enables them to affiliate with these states. The law shapes as well as reflects our political identities; because cross-border political participation is permitted under existing law, it is relatively easy for individuals to identify with other states as they seek to influence those states’ politics. If the law proscribed such engagement, Americans’ identification with other states would likely decline accordingly. More broadly, recognizing the legitimacy of cross-border participation underscores the role of the states as significant political actors in our national polity. The very fact that individuals from Texas seek to influence California politics, and vice versa, indicates that the states are critical actors on the national stage. Cross-state political participation demonstrates states’ importance as sites of governance and identification, not their lack thereof.

Private corporations are viewed more favourably by emerging economies than developed nations, that's the crucial finding of the CNBC-Burson Marsteller Global Perception Indicator- a survey conducted by research firm Penn Schoen Berland across 25 countries, 25000 individuals and 1800 corporate executives.
72 percent of people living in emerging economies view corporate favourable as against 52 percent in emerging markets.
Here is one piece of data thrown up by the survey that is the most striking- 84 percent of people in China view corporations as a source of "hope" and in the United States only 36 percent agree with that view.
So, is the west getting skeptical about capitalism? And why are emerging economies viewing corporates more favourably? Don Baer CEO, Burson Marsteller believes that the economic recovery has not benefitted everyone in the developed world.

Police narrow search area in hunt for suspect in Pa. state trooper shootingsBy Mark Berman September 22 Follow @markberman

As the hunt for a gunman police say shot two Pennsylvania state troopers stretched into another week, authorities offered glimmers of hope following days of school closures and orders to shelter in place.
Police are scouring a remote corner of northeastern Pennsylvania for Eric Matthew Frein, the 31-year-old they have described as “extremely dangerous.” Frein has been charged with ambushing two troopers outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove late on Sept. 12, setting off an intense manhunt that has lasted for 10 days and rattled the region.
Over the weekend, the Pennsylvania State Police had asked residents of Barrett and Price Townships to shelter in place. People were urged to stay away from windows and to remain indoors. While the order was lifted, residents were still told to exercise caution, with the hunt throwing normal patterns of life into disarray.
Authorities say they are making headway in the hunt, as the search area “is narrowing,” Lt. Col George Bivens of the state police said at a news conference Monday.

This manhunt is in an area of rocky, rugged terrain and very dense woods, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett said. The search is particularly fraught for law enforcement, as police are searching for someone with the stated goal of killing police, Corbett said. Still, he believe that police are making progress.
“I feel confident that we should be able to apprehend this individual,” Corbett said at the same news conference Monday. “I’m very positive about that.”
As long as the hunt is going on, people should continue to lock their doors, keep their cars locked and “use common sense,” Corbett said.
Searchers have found things that Frein had left behind or even stored to use in the future, Bivens said Sunday. That included an assault rifle, magazines and ammunition.
“We know that Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months and maybe years,” Bivens said. “He planned his attack and his retreat.”

The Pennsylvania State Police say that Frein opened fire at the Blooming Grove barracks, targeting two troopers. Cpl. Bryon Dickson was shot and killed while leaving the barracks. Alex Douglass, another trooper, was seriously wounded while arriving. (Frein could have also shot at civilians during this assault, but chose not to, Corbett said, which is why they believe he is only targeting police.)
That launched a manhunt throughout the region. On Monday morning, a man found a Jeep in a pond not far from the barracks. Police said they found Frein’s driver’s license and Social Security card inside the vehicle, along with shell casings that matched those found near the barracks.
The following day, police publicly identified Frein and described him as a highly-trained survivalist with a strong desire to kill police officers. He also belonged to a group that simulated military activities, police said, with members acting as soldiers from eastern Europe.
On Thursday, the FBI added Frein to their list of the 10 most wanted fugitives. They are offering $100,000 for information leading to his arrest, which is on top of a $75,000 reward being offered by a group called the Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers.
Human trackers and dogs are showing signs that police “are on the right trail,” Bivens said Sunday.
“Up until now, his advantage has been that this is his back yard and he knows this rugged terrain,” he said. “Our tactical operations people now also know his back yard, the area he once felt safe in.”
Some schools in the area that had closed last week remained closed on Monday, and others that reopened did so with new rules in place. The Pocono Mountain School District remained closed for a third school day Monay owing to “ongoing safety concerns,” according to the district.
Meanwhile, the Wallenpaupack Area School District reopened Monday after closing on Thursday and Friday. “We are in unprecedented times for our area,” superintendent Michael Silsby wrote in a message to the district. He said that the school will take additional security measures and keep students inside for the entire school day.
However, owing to the situation, he said it is up to parents if they want to send students to school. Any absences will be excused, he said.

Mizoram Congress leader files FIR over Facebook post by Aizawl womanPrint
Written by Adam Halliday | Aizwal | Posted: September 22, 2014 8:56 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 8:58 pm
A senior office bearer of the Mizoram Pradesh Youth Congress Committee, or MPYCC, filed an FIR against a woman from Aizawl for a Facebook post in which she alleged a Mizo fugitive and his friends were beaten up in Delhi by two Mizo Congress youth members impersonating plain clothes policemen.
MPYCC secretary R. Lalhmingmawia Ralte filed the FIR at the Aizawl Police Station on Monday against one Lalrinfeli who goes by the Facebook name Felly Jahau.
Ralte said in the FIR someone going by the name Felly Jahau posted an article on the widely-followed “Zoram Politics” Facebook group where she “defamed” the ruling Congress party and mentioned two party leaders who “do not exist.”
The said Facebook post talked about one Michael, a man wanted by Mizoram Police in connection with a case involving allegations of EVM rigging during last year’s state assembly polls, being approached and manhandled by two men in Delhi.
The post alleged the men were impersonating plainclothes policemen but turned out to be youth Congress leaders.
Michael is wanted by police for instigating a well-known Aizawl educationist to make allegations the Congress rigged EVMs using a “powerful radiowave machine” and winning 34 of the state’s 40 assembly seats unfairly.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has sought the permission of the Ministry of Home Affairs to file a case against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
Following reports of Indian youths joining ISIS, the NIA is said to have suggested that an “open case” under provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and the UN Convention on terrorism could be filed against ISIS for brainwashing youths into committing acts of terror.
“We are still deliberating the specific sections under which the case would be registered. The Home Ministry is to take a final call on it,” a senior NIA official said.

Shares of RadioShack Corp. ( RSH ) rose nearly 5% Monday morning after the struggling retailer said its executives and largest creditors “have had discussions with a major vendor” about modifying a “commercial relationship” to avoid bankruptcy.
“These discussions did not result in a change to the commercial relationship at this time but are continuing,” the Fort Worth, Texas-based company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Its shares rose 4 cents to 95 cents.
With customers increasingly opting to buy electronic parts and gadgets online, RadioShack has been struggling to stay afloat. Earlier this month, the company said it was running out of cash and could be forced to seek bankruptcy protection if it can’t find other ways to shore up finances.
Sales fell 22% year-over-year in the second quarter to $673.8 million, and the company had only about $30.5 million in cash as of the end of the quarter.
“The company continues to explore how to optimize its various commercial relationships in light of alternative restructuring scenarios, and may involve lenders, bondholders, shareholders, lease counterparties and other stakeholders in these discussions at any time,” it said.
RadioShack also warned that such discussions may not result in changes to its commercial arrangements.

Trent'anni di attività imprenditoriale e dieci aziende ma nessun lavoratore a tempo indeterminato, tranne il figlio Matteo Renzi "regolarizzato appena una settimana prima della candidatura alla poltrona sicura di presidente della Provincia di Firenze".
È il record segnato da Tiziano Renzi, padre del premier, indagato per bancarotta fraudolenta dalla procura di Genova.
In un articolo pubblicato dal Fatto quotidiano vengono elencate le dieci società intestate al genitore di Matteo Renzi: "Fanno uso quasi esclusivo di lavoratori atipici". Non per mancanza di affari: "La Chil Post nel 2009 supera i 4 milioni di fatturato o la Mail Service che nel 2006, prima di essere ceduta, chiude il bilancio indicando nello stato patrimoniale un attivo di 4 milioni".
"In città molti hanno collaborato con la Chil, alcuni poi sono diventati giornalisti di testate locali. 'Era faticoso perché ci svegliavamo all'alba ma per il resto era il classico lavoro da studenti e ci ripagavamo le sigarette e qualche uscita di sera'. Il contratto era atipico. 'Ma era regolare cioè potevano farlo'".

Un gol, poi la corsa fino in tribuna saltando la vetrata che la divide dal campo e un abbraccio a una tifosa 'nonna': è la singolare esultanza di Florenzi, attaccante della Roma, autore della rete del 2-0 al Cagliari all'Olimpico. Dopo il raddoppio segnato al Cagliari
Florenzi ha festeggiato salendo in tribuna andando ad abbracciare la nonna 82enne, per la prima volta spettatrice allo stadio Olimpico. Il gesto è costato un'ammonizione al giocatore della Roma, punito dall'arbitro Peruzzo per aver abbandonato il terreno di gioco.
"Questo gol è per mia nonna, è fantastica". Così Alessandro Florenzi al termine del primo tempo della gara di campionato che la Roma sta conducendo per 2-0 sul Cagliari allo stadio Olimpico. Il raddoppio è stato siglato proprio dall'esterno giallorosso che poi è corso in tribuna per abbracciare la nonna, rimediando anche una ammonizione.
"E' la prima volta che viene a vedermi, non lo aveva mai fatto, nemmeno quando ero bambino, quando poteva farlo più facilmente. Invece si è fatta questa scarpinata, e da una nonna di 82 anni non è da tutti. Questo gol è per lei perchè mi ha detto 'Vengo a vedere solo te, pero' vieni a salutarmì. E allora l'ho fatto solo per lei, ne è valsa la pena prendere il cartellino giallo" ha concluso Florenzi ai microfoni di Sky.

"Peccato che a Roma sia difficile trovare la carne di cavallo!". È bastata una frase pronunciata dalla ministra Maria Elena Boschi per provocare le furie degli animalisti e della deputata Micaela Vittoria Brambilla (Fi), impegnata in prima linea proprio per includere i cavalli nella lista degli animali da affezione.
L'episodio risale a venerdì, quando Boschi ha fatto visita alla Festa dell'Unità di Zagarolo (Roma) . Qui le hanno offerto il "tordo matto", specialità a base di carne equina . In questo frangente la ministra alle Riforme costituzionali si è lamentata perché a Roma "si fa fatica trovare carne di cavallo".
L'affermazione non è sfuggita all'Ente nazionale per la protezione degli animali ("ha perso un'occasione per tacere, tanta insensibilità la dice lunga sulla sconnessione tra chi ci governa e i cittadini così infelicemente amministrati""), e nemmeno alla Brambilla che vorrebbe vietare la macellazione di questi animali così come accade negli Stati Uniti.

La cura Di Bella torna di moda: migliaia di pazienti. Lo scienziato Marco Geddes da Filicaia: "È inefficace" (FOTO)

Il "Metodo Di Bella" è tornato di moda. Migliaia di pazienti ricorrono alle cure di Giuseppe Di Bella, il figlio di quel medico dai capelli bianchi che negli anni '90 riuscì a ottenere la sperimentazione della sua terapia anticancro . Secondo l'avvocato Gianluca Ottaviano, si tratta della "seconda cura antitumorale del Paese", alla quale negli anni si sono sottoposte circa due-tremila persone. Se per lo scienziato Marco Geddes da Filicaia, intervistato da La Stampa, il metodo "è inefficace, e la gente deve saperlo", Giuseppe Di Bella si difende così: "Noi siamo seri, ormai su questi temi c'è vasta letteratura".
I farmaci sono quelli di sempre, quelli che già suo padre utilizzava a suo tempo - si legge su La Stampa - somatostatina prima di tutto e poi ancora octreotide, vitamine (A, C, D, E), melatonina, calcio e molto altro ancora. "I risultati ci sono e ottimi", si infervora l'avvocato Ottaviano. "L'unico guaio è che la si deve pagare tutta di tasca propria. E non tutti possono permetterselo".
Il problema del "costo" viene risolto in alcuni casi dai tribunali che impongono alle Asl di "pagare le cure ad alcuni malati": le sentenze favorevoli si basano su perizie che constatano la regressione del male. Ma un'altra questione è tutta da risolvere: quali sono i reali benefici della cura? "L'importante è che le persone siano informate bene sui fatti: il metodo Di Bella è stato valutato in modo approfondito e rigoroso. Ed è stato giudicato privo di efficacia dimostrabile scientificamente", commenta il professor Marco Geddes da Filicaia , intervistato dal quotidiano.
Lo scienziato ha fatto parte della commissione scientifica che nel 1998 valutò la cura. "Fu una sperimentazione corposa e valutata anche da esperti internazionali e indicò che non c'era alcun risultato, a livello di scomparsa o regressione della patologia, grazie al cocktail messo a punto da Di Bella padre. E poi ci fu la revisione delle cartelle cliniche - chiamiamole così - presenti negli archivi del dottore: pure questa non diede alcuna evidenza dell'efficacia del metodo".
Proprio a proposito del "cocktail", Giuseppe Di Bella spiega: "Tutto dipende da come viene somministrata la somatostatina, altrimenti può avere effetti dannosi". "Noi curiamo anche gente al quarto stadio della malattia. Pazienti nei confronti dei quali la medicina tradizionale non fa più nulla se non somministrare cure palliative. Noi, anche in alcuni di questi casi, riusciamo ad ottenere risultati importanti. Dal blocco della progressione fino alla remissione completa e stabile della malattia".
Ma se i risultati ci sono e sono stati pubblicati su importanti riviste, perché non viene proposta un'altra sperimentazione? "Perché sarebbe del tutto inutile - risponde Di Bella - in questa vicenda c'è un gigantesco conflitto di interessi. Sia di natura finanziaria che ideologica. E sono questioni forti, insormontabili".

L'amico scout di Matteo Renzi, Matteo Spanò, e quel mutuo da mezzo milione di euro concesso a Tiziano Renzi

"Intorno al 2010" il Credito Cooperativo di Pontassieve, banca con sede nel paese dove risiede Matteo Renzi, concesse un mutuo di 500mila euro alla Chill Post, azienda ancora in mano al padre del premier Tiziano Renzi.
Lo scrive Marco Imarisio sul Corriere della Sera , aggiungendo un dettaglio importante per la comprensione dell'inchiesta che ha coinvolto Renzi senior, indagato a Genova per bancarotta fraudolenta ; a capo della banca, nel periodo in esame, c'era Matteo Spanò, amico d'infanzia del presidente del Consiglio al quale Renzi diede la guida dell'associazione Muse per la gestione degli spazi museali di Palazzo Vecchio. Spanò è stato anche l'organizzatore della Route, l'assemblea nazionale Agesci che ha riunito 35mila scout, un appuntamento al quale ha partecipato lo stesso premier.
La banca del paese è l’unico filo di questa storia che in qualche modo può condurre all’attuale presidente del Consiglio. L’attuale presidente del Credito Cooperativo di Pontassieve, in carica dal 2010, ex consigliere di amministrazione dal 2008 al 2010, è il quarantenne Matteo Spanò, amico del presidente del Consiglio fin dalla tenera età e suo uomo di fiducia. Appena diventato sindaco, Renzi gli affidò la guida dell’associazione Muse, che gestisce gli spazi museali di Palazzo Vecchio e tutti i musei civici di Firenze, una specie di cassaforte cittadina. L’ex boy scout Spanò, ai vertici dell’Agesci, l’associazione di categoria, è stato uno degli organizzatori della Route, l’evento che nell’agosto appena trascorso ha riunito 35 mila scout nel parco di San Rossore, con la partecipazione straordinaria, durata due giorni, di Matteo Renzi.

Gli esploratori del Nautilus si sono imbattuti in un delizioso polpo Dumbo. Sembra l'inizio di un racconto di Giulio Verne in salsa Disney, e invece l'incontro è accaduto realmente sui fondali marini dell'America centrale dove le telecamere dell'Exploration Vessel Nautilus hanno filmato un rarissimo esemplare di Grimpoteuthis bathynectes - conosciuto come polpo Dumbo per via delle due protuberanze che ricordano l'elefantino dei cartoni animati.
Questi animaletti normalmente sfuggono agli occhi umani poiché preferiscono nuotare dai 400 ai 4800 metri di profondità. L'esserino incontrato dal Nautilus è così buffo che un membro dell'equipaggio ha osservato: "Sarebbe perfetto per un cartone animato". Non possiamo dargli torto.

Issue of stuck packaged food cargo reaches PMOIssue of stuck packaged food cargo reaches PMO
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, September 22:  
The issue of processed food import consignments worth crores of rupees held up by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) in various ports and airports due to ‘improper’ labelling has landed at the Prime Minister’s door.
“I have discussed the issue with Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and the matter is now with the PMO. The system needs to be more transparent and less rigid,” said Union Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal here on Monday. She added that while health safety had to be kept in mind, the growth of industry should also be taken into account.
According to FSSAI, the nodal agency under the Health Ministry, labels on shipped imported packaged food items must list the ingredients used and the nutritional value in English, along with the producer’s name, address and the country of origin in the prescribed format. As per the Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006 that came into force in 2011, pasting of stickers on products is also not allowed.
Badal, who was addressing the media on the her Ministry’s 100-day report card, however, denied reports that her Ministry was pushing for the food regulator to be brought under her Ministry, or jointly handled with the Health Ministry.
“It does not matter under who the system is, but it should not be arbitrary,” Badal said, adding that various stakeholders had met her regarding their import consignments being held up ahead of the festival season. Among the companies affected are some top MNCs as well as gourmet restaurants that use ingredients, such as olives and olive oil, canola oil liquor, seafood, herbs, sauces, chocolate and other ingredients.
Almost 400-500 odd containers of shipment were lying at different ports and airports for their failure to meet FSSAI’s labelling norms. Some importers are said to have even made advance payments for them.

NCP  Cong move to end seats rowNCP, Cong move to end seats row

Key talks: NCP leaders Sharad Pawar (right) and Sunil Tatkare at the Party's core committee meeting in Mumbai on Monday. - VIVEK BENDRE
New Delhi, September 22:  
The Congress leadership is taking hope from the NCP’s decision to hold further discussions with it on their alliance. Though the NCP has demanded at least half of the total 288 Assembly seats, the Congress believes the real issue is not sharing of seats, but the chief ministerial ambition of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.
The NCP on Monday reiterated that it will continue the alliance but also remained firm on its demand for half the Assembly seats in the October 15 Maharashtra Assembly elections. Senior NCP leader Praful Patel said after a party core committee meeting that the party has unanimously decided to continue the alliance with Congress in the State, but is now waiting for a response from the latter.
The Congress high command, after a meeting of the central election committee on Maharashtra, expressed hope that the issues will be settled amicably. The Congress is also attempting some hard bargaining by discussing probable candidates for all the 288 seats. “We have held discussion on all seats,” AICC general secretary Madhusudan Mistry said.
He added that Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, PCC President Manikrao Thakre and the General Secretary in-charge of the State Mohan Prakash will hold discussions with the high command on the issue of alliance.
Later, a Congress leader said the possibilities on the alliance are on “razor’s edge.” “There is 75 per cent chance for the alliance. We do not think that the secular cadre of the NCP will allow the party leadership to leave the alliance,” the leader said and added that the issue can be amicably resolved once Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar meet.
“We do not think that the real issue is seat sharing. The real issue is the aspiration of the Deputy Chief Minister to become Chief Minister,” the leader added.
Ajit Pawar has been advocating going it alone for quite some time. A big section of the NCP that favours this policy believes that the party has more chances to win in a four-cornered fight in the State.
Going it alone
Chhagan Bhujbal, another NCP strongman, has also publicly said that all the parties should contest alone in the State.
Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said there is no scope for a four-cornered contest in the State and the alliance will continue. Chavan said discussions with the NCP are going on on a separate platform. “We are completing our seat selection while talks with NCP are going on at a different level. Discussions with NCP are going on,” he told reporters after the meeting of the selection committee.

Each year, 50,000 Indian mothers die due to pregnancy related complications. Those deaths are tragic for the simple fact that India is losing its mothers and the ripple effect of a missing mother on her children and community is incalculable. And though child deaths have been coming down, 1.4 million Indian children still die every year, most from preventable causes.

Experts Follow Sole Survivor To Deserted Massacre SiteExperts Follow Sole Survivor To Deserted Massacre Site In Peru's Andes

PACCHA, Peru (AP) — This remote hamlet on fertile Andean slopes beside the Apurimac river has been a ghost town for three decades, inhabited only by the buried bodies of villagers slain by security forces who considered them rebel sympathizers.
Earlier this month, forensic investigators began unearthing the remains of the nearly two dozen victims of the July 14, 1984, massacre in this region where government forces regularly hunted alleged collaborators of the Shining Path guerrillas.
Dolores Guzman, the sole survivor, set aside the street stand where she sells hard-boiled eggs in the capital of Lima and journeyed last week to Paccha to help forensic experts find the common graves.

Arriving was not easy. This rugged southeastern region known as "Oreja de Perro," or Dog's Ear, lacks telephones and good roads. Cocaine-trafficking remnants of the otherwise conquered Shining Path movement coexist here with young Quechua men who ferry coca paste over the Andes in backpacks.

In all, 21 sets of human remains were recovered, including those of eight children and a fetus, said Luis Rueda, the forensic archaeologist overseeing the dig. Some 70,000 people were killed in the 1980-2000 internal conflict, most of them civilians, a truth commission found.
Peruvian prosecutors have only recently begun in earnest to catalog the human rights violations committed during those two decades, and identify those responsible.
Since 2003, the remains of slightly more than 2,400 victims have been recovered, but the bodies of an estimated 12,000 more, mostly poor, Quechua-speaking farmers, are believed to remain unearthed. That's more than the number of people who were disappeared during 1970s dictatorships in Argentina or Chile, where the victims were primarily educated city-dwellers.

Today, Paccha is in ruins, the wooden dwellings of its silenced populace are mere skeletons.
Before the massacre, the hamlet was a refuge for dozens of families trying to flee the conflict, said Guzman, who was 20 years old and four months pregnant at the time.
The afternoon of the slayings, Guzman was washing clothes in the river when a patrol of paramilitary police arrived. Thirty villagers managed to escape, but she and 20 other people, including another pregnant woman, were seized.
The killers at Paccha used pseudonyms so Guzman doesn't know their names. Prosecutors say an investigation will now begin, though they lack names as well.
She was spared, she says, because one of her cousins was a police guide. The day after the killings, she was marched out of the village and released.
The cost of keeping her life was to prepare a last meal for the condemned. She cooked sweetened pumpkin and personally fed each detainee because their hands were bound behind them. She gave them water, too.
No one begged for mercy, said Guzman. It seemed futile.
But the silence broke when the killing began, she said.
"The children cried the loudest."

No More Words. Only Emojireddit
Why express yourself in words, when emoji are just so much better? The makers of Keymoji , a free, downloadable keyboard that's compatible with the new iOS 8 for Apple, clearly agree.
Keymoji replaces Apple's new autocomplete bar with emoji-only suggestions.  For example, typing "Going to bed" brings up *Zzz* or the more complete *person* + *number 2* + *sleeping face.* If you click on either, it'll convert the entire text to emoji. For that phrase, it also suggests *zzz* + *ant* + *ladybug* + *ant* in case you actually meant "bed bugs."
You can't rely on autocorrect when you have Keymoji on, so type carefully. But it's easy to go back and forth between the predictive text and the predictive emoji by just pressing the globe in the lower left corner.
Beyond the keyboard, the app itself allows people to submit their own emoji phrases and art. Anyone can use the user-generated emojis, and you can find them by clicking on the little artist palette on the keyboard.
The original emojis that get used the most are ranked on the app's Leaderboards.
"There’s nothing quite like crowdsourcing,” cofounder Randy Saaf told Re/code .
It looks like Keymoji users are making the most of the option to express themselves in little pictures. Check out the highest ranked emoji combos below:
UPDATED: Those current stakes will soon change, however. Cofounder Randy Saaf told The Huffington Post that his team will introduce a profanity filter within the week and plan to add a reporting feature for users similar to what Facebook and YouTube has done.

Krishnapatnam Port gears up for SCIs Yangon-Colombo serviceThe Hindu A view of Krishnapatnam Port
TOPICS
waterway and maritime transport
Having enabled the traders to connect with their counterparts in Myanmar and Colombo, the Krishnapatnam Port Company Ltd (KPCL) is all set to welcome the Shipping Corporation of India’s yet-to-be-named service that would connect both the countries.
At present, KPCL is facilitating a fortnightly service to the Port of Yangon, which is about 1,100 nautical miles, and two weekly services to Colombo through private shipping lines (500 nautical miles).
However, it never occurred to KPCL officials to connect these destinations.
The commencement of SCI’s new service Colombo-Chennai-Krishnapatnam-Yangon-Colombo from October first week would enable the trade to reach these destinations quicker and at lesser cost. From KPCL, traders are exporting clinker, telecom equipment and cars and on return these vessels carried pulses, timber and garment.
Talking to The Hindu, KPCL Director and CEO Anil Yendluri said: “The inclusion of Krishnapatnam Port in the new service is a testimony to our success, and this brings us on a par with major Indian ports. India and Myanmar needs lot of things and this service would help all of us immensely.”
KPCL was the first port to hold trade meet in Myanmar. It also held a trade meet in Ivory Coast that saw significant increase in export of rice and cashew.
Krishnapatnam Rail Company Ltd (KRCL) has completed doubling of 26-km track between the port and Venkatachalam Road junction. On an average 24 rakes are deployed to move one lakh tonnes of cargo such as clinker, containers, cement, agri-food and granites on a daily basis.
“Doubling of track will help provide seamless connectivity to Chennai-Kolkata cities, edible oil refineries, steel, thermal and cement plants located at the hinterland of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. We are all set to become the Eastern gateway of India,” he said.

oil and gas - upstream activities
State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation’s (ONGC) major oil discovery in the Bay of Bengal will start production in 2019, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K. Sarraf said here on Saturday.
“We are moving fast on KG-D5 development. First gas from the block is planned for 2018 and first oil in 2019,” he told reporters.
Estimates
“Conservative estimates put the production at 75,000-plus bpd,” he said.
The oil discovery in Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 is the first large oil production from the east coast. The block also has 10 gas discoveries.
KG-D5 will produce up to 4.5 million tonnes per annum — the largest from any field on the east coast.

For The Love Of God  Don t Put Your iPhone In The MicrowaveThere's a hoax going around the Internet instructing people to put their iPhone in a microwave in order to charge it.
Let us be very clear here: Do. Not. Put. Your. Phone. In. A. Microwave.
On Wednesday, anyone with an iPhone purchased in the past three years could download iOS 8, Apple's shiny new operating system. iOS 8 has many fun new features, including snappier email, smarter autocorrect and a fitness tracker .
But an image circulating on Twitter describes one fun, "exclusive" feature that's definitely not included in iOS 8. It claims that you can wirelessly charge an iPhone by putting it in the microwave for 60 to 70 seconds.
Despite the sleek Apple-esque design of the explainer for the "feature," there are a couple telltale signs that this image is fake. One, there's no "i" in front of "Wave." Duh. Two, on what Earth would it be a good idea to put a hunk of metal in a microwave?
Like most awful things on the Internet, it seems like this hoax may have originated on 4chan, according to screengrabs posted on Reddit .
As you may recall, 4chan is the anarchistic Internet forum that convinced dozens of people that last year's new iOS made iPhones waterproof . (It did not.)
But the idea that a microwave could charge a phone didn't start on 4chan. It's actually a longstanding Internet hoax:
So did some poor, unfortunate souls fall for the prank? It's hard to tell, because you can't really trust what anyone says online. One guy tweeting under the handle @Fallenbot initially claimed he microwaved his phone...
I tried using the new IOS 8 feature WAVE where you can charge your phone with a microwave, does not work @Apple pic.twitter.com/IWsWnVboUl
...before clarifying that his tweet was, basically, a hoax within a hoax.
The amount of people that believe this pic.twitter.com/BktAkFobjn
Let's hope no one actually tried.

DETROIT (AP) — Chrysler is recalling almost 189,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Durangos in the U.S. to fix a fuel pump problem that can cause the SUVs to stall.
But a safety advocate says the recall doesn't cover enough models, contending the same problem can happen in millions of other Chrysler, Jeep and Ram vehicles.
The recall, posted Saturday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, covers some 2011 models with 3.6-liter V6 or 5.7-liter V8 engines. Chrysler says a relay can fail, increasing the risk of a crash, although the company said that as of Aug. 25, it wasn't aware of any crashes or injuries.
The company began looking into the problem in October of 2013 and traced it to a spring that can become deformed because of heat.
The vehicles also might not start, and the fuel pump could keep working even when the engine is shut off. The company says that as of Aug. 25 it's not aware of any crashes or injuries from the problem.
The recall covers SUVs built from Jan. 25, 2010 through July 20, 2011, according to the NHTSA documents.
Dealers will replace the fuel pump relay for free starting Oct. 24.
The Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader, says the recall is inadequate because more than 5 million other Chrysler vehicles have the same fuel pump power control module as the Grand Cherokee and Durango.
"Chrysler should recall them all," Clarence Ditlow, the center's executive director, said Saturday.
Ditlow's group filed a petition last month asking NHTSA to investigate power system failures in Chrysler vehicles that could cause them to stall while being driven.
In the petition, the group contended that an electrical power control module used by Chrysler in millions of vehicles since 2007 can go haywire, causing them to stall in traffic and cut off devices powered by electricity. The allegation covered Ram pickup trucks, Chrysler and Dodge minivans, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Durango and Dodge Journey SUVs, the Jeep Wrangler, and other models.
The safety group says it has received over 70 complaints and that the government has received hundreds.
NHTSA has yet to make a decision on whether to investigate the matter. Chrysler said it is investigating consumer complaints and retrieving components from vehicles in the field for a closer analysis. The company says its vehicles meet all federal safety standards.
The center's petition said that Chrysler's "Totally Integrated Power Module," which includes a computer, relays and fuses, distributes electrical power through the entire vehicle. In addition to stalling, the faulty modules have may have caused air bags not to inflate and fuel pumps to keep running, causing unintended acceleration and fires, the petition said.
Ditlow said the company started phasing them out in 2012, but they remain in the 2014 Jeep Wrangler and the Dodge and Chrysler minivans.
NHTSA also is looking into a New Jersey man's petition filed earlier this month alleging that Chrysler minivans can stall unexpectedly after refueling.
Car owners and advocacy groups can petition the NHTSA asking for investigations that sometimes lead to recalls. The Center for Auto Safety has successfully petitioned NHTSA in the past, including one instance that led to the recent recall of 1.56 million older Jeep SUVs with fuel tanks mounted behind the rear axles. The center contended the tanks can leak fuel and cause fires in a crash, while Chrysler maintains the tanks perform as well as comparable models from other automakers.

State s locks  dams in urgent need of repair  report says37
There are eight locks and dams in the Illinois Waterway System, as well as 29 on the state’s borders, according to the report. All but one were built in the 1930s and according to the report “are in desperate need of repair.”
Preventive maintenance, according to the report, has given way to what the Army Corps of Engineers calls a “fix-as-fail strategy.”
Barring additional revenue, the report states, infrastructure improvements in Illinois waterways may be put on hold by the Army Corps.
The report calls the locks and dams outdated and says they have caused backups that have reduced average tonnage carried through the state’s locks by 20 percent.
Through the report, the Chamber contends that a functioning waterway system saves money on transportation, allows for the use of less fuel, benefits tourism and contributes to less carbon dioxide emission. The report also says that improving the waterways would enhance the state’s global competitiveness, create jobs, relieve traffic congestion on the state’s roads and rail, and inject money into the state’s economy.

Gold Extends Losses, Down Rs 120 on Global Cues, Weak Demand
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 22, 2014 15:10 (IST)
Gold Rebounds on Seasonal Demand; Global Cues
New Delhi: Continuing its declining trend for the third day, gold on Monday fell by another Rs 120 to Rs 26,850 per ten gram in the national capital, tracking weak cues from the global market where the precious metal was trading at an eight-month low.
Besides, subdued demand from jewellers in view of ongoing "Shraadh" - considered as inauspicious days - and diversion of funds towards the rising equity markets too put pressure on prices, traders said.
Silver also dropped for the fifth straight day and declined further by Rs 375 to Rs 39,250 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Sentiment remained weak as gold held near an eight-month low in global markets as the outlook for higher US borrowing costs strengthened the dollar, damping demand for a store of value.
Gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, traded 0.60 per cent lower at $1,208.40 an ounce. Silver also fell 0.3 per cent to $17.78 an ounce, the lowest level since August 2010.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity fell further by Rs 120 each to Rs 26,850 and Rs 26,650 per ten gram respectively. It had lost Rs 480 in the previous two sessions.
Sovereign, however, held steady at Rs 24,200 per piece of eight gram in limited deals.
In a similar fashion, silver ready remained under selling pressure and surrendered Rs 375 to Rs 39,250 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 805 to Rs 38,895 per kg after it sank to four-year low in overseas market. The white metal lost Rs 1,975 in the last four days.
Silver coins plunged by Rs 1,000 to Rs 69,000 for buying and Rs 70,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

NASDAQ Financial Markets European Central Bank NYSE Euronext, Inc. GameStop Corp. Mario Draghi
By Ryan Vlastelica
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a fifth straight weekly advance after China's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and its euro zone peer announced asset purchases in efforts to boost each region's economy.
The gains were broad on a day when both the Dow and S&P 500 ended at closing records. All ten primary S&P 500 industry sectors ended the day higher, while 63 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory. About 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed names were higher on the day.
The People's Bank of China said it was cutting one-year benchmark lending rates for the first time in more than two years.
The move came after European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said "excessively low" inflation had to be raised quickly by whatever means necessary, rekindling expectations the ECB will move to stimulate the euro zone economy. The ECB said it started buying asset-backed securities to encourage banks to lend and revive the economy.
"It isn't the size of the moves but the shock value of the direction that is really lifting markets today," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets. "This is a one-two punch for global growth."
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 88.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,807.94, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 10.7 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,063.45 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.10 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,712.97.
Both the Dow and S&P ended at records. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P added 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent. It was the fifth straight weekly advance for all three.
Gains in the Nasdaq were limited by declines in large-cap tech companies. Microsoft Corp  fell 1.5 percent to $47.97 while Netflix Inc  slid 2.1 percent to $360.28.
GameStop Corp  sank 13 percent to $37.86 a day after the video game retailer posted quarterly revenue and earnings well below expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500.
The benchmark index's biggest gainers were Ross Stores  and Autodesk Inc , both of which rallied after results late Thursday. Ross jumped 7.3 percent to $89.27 while Autodesk was up 6.1 percent to $61.95.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,029 to 1,039, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,461 issues rose and 1,286 fell, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 96 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 44 new lows.
About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the month-to-date average of 6.35 billion.

Electrotherm may launch electric three wheeler next fiscalElectrotherm may launch electric three wheeler next fiscal
Sohini Das | Ahmedabad Sep 22, 2014 09:29 PM IST
As the Centre is expected to take steps to come up with a law to allow plying of e-rickshaws, firms like Electrotherm India Ltd (EIL) are now working on improving the design of the electric three wheeler prototypes they have so that they can grab the opportunity when the time comes. The company is likely to launch the e-three wheeler in the market sometime next fiscal.
Mukesh Bhandari, chairman and chief technical officer of EIL said that the market for electric three wheelers in India is already estimated to be around 100,000 units a year, and once they are legalised through necessary notification, the demand can easily touch 200,000 units a year. His firm already has an electric three-wheeler product since 2006. It did not launch the vehicle commercially owing to low demand as well as working capital crunch.
Bhandari said, “We are working on upgrading the design of the vehicle, and if everything goes well, we can launch the vehicle next fiscal.”
Earlier, this month road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari had said that the government is working coming out with a law that will allow plying of e-rickshaws in Delhi. A notification pertaining e-rickshaws has already been issued.
The government is trying to look at safety and other concerns raised over e-rickshaws and is taking necessary steps as well as modifications in the rules and law to allow the plying of these battery operated vehicles. The Delhi High Court had banned the plying of e-rickshaws on city roads in July and on September 9 had said that the ban on e-rickshaws in the capital would continue until rules are framed to regulate them.
However, as new set of rules are expected that would regulate the plying of e-rickshaws, it opens up huge opportunity for firms like EIL.
As Bhandari explained the firm had a far better quality product ready compared to the electric three wheelers on Delhi roads that require frequent battery replacements. “Even after the limitation of replacing the battery almost every six months, operators are keen on the e-rickshaws as they are economic when one considers the price of conventional fuel. Hence, there is significant demand,” he said.
Anticipating the huge demand for electric three-wheelers in India, already a group of 15 companies from China are planning to set up an industrial park near Sanand with an investment of around $ 100 million. A delegation comprising seven electric vehicle manufacturing companies visited Sanand in August.
This apart, companies are also waiting for more clarity on the subsidy front expected to be announced as a part of the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020. A Noida-based company Lohia Auto has already launched electric three wheelers during the last Auto Expo and they are priced around Rs one lakh at the moment without the subsidy.
Bhandari did not wish to comment on the pricing front for EIL’s electric three wheelers.

How to take action right now to save on health insurance during the open enrollment period.It's open enrollment! Here's three ways to save on health insurance

It's open enrollment season, a short period of time when companies offer employees the opportunity to make changes to their health insurance and other benefits for the next year. In some cases, your choices this fall could potentially save you hundreds of dollars in 2015.
But you have to take action right now.
Workplace benefits can be complex and confusing to navigate for the nearly 150 million Americans are covered under employer-sponsored health plans. Yet, taking time to ensure that the plan you selected last year is still appropriate for you and your family can potentially save you hundreds of dollars. If you or your dependents have had a change in their health status, you need to consider the out-of-pocket costs and possibly change your plan.
"Determine if you and any dependents on your plan are a high health-care user or low health-care user," said physician and certified financial planner Carolyn McClanahan of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. "Do you visit the doctor only if you're so sick you have to be taken by an ambulance or do you frequent your practitioner every time you get a cough? If you go to the doctor a lot or have a lot of prescriptions, then most likely a lower deductible plan (with higher premiums) is a better option for you. If you rarely go, then likely a high deductible plan (with lower premiums) will be the best option."
Here are three strategies to help you save a little more on health-care costs:
1. Get a discount or bonus with health-care incentives.
Check if your employer is offering any cash incentives for taking extra steps towards your health, such as filling out a health questionnaire, taking a biometric screening, or certifying that you are a non-tobacco user,  said Tracy Watts, a Washington, D.C.-based senior partner at the global consulting firm Mercer.
There are also additional charges to keep in mind. Some employers have a spousal surcharge. So if your spouse has access through his or her employer and they choose not to take it and go on your insurance instead, your employer may charge you extra. Having separate plans could save you money.
2. Carry over $500 in a Flexible Spending Account to next year.
A Flexible Spending Account (FSA) allows you to contribute money from your paycheck to a special fund that can be used for eligible heath-care expenses. Your contributions are made pre-tax, which saves you money, and can be used for medical expenses and dependent care, including child-care costs. Some employees have been wary of FSAs since unused funds generally expire.
But there's been a change to the "use it or lose it" rule: Many employers now offer the ability to carry over $500 of unused FSA money into the next year.
3. Put away money in a Health Savings Account for now, or later.
A Health Savings Account (HSA) is for people enrolled in high-deductible health plans. Contributions are also made pre-tax and what you don't use in a given year will carry over to the next plan year. You can even take your HSA with you when you change jobs. The maximum contribution in 2015 for an HSA is $3,350 for individuals and $6,650 for families. Catch-up contributions for those age 55 or older are $1,000.
You can have an HSA even if your employer doesn't offer one. The only caveat is that you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan.
"If you've done that, anyone can open an account with a bank or broker. Plus it has a triple tax advantage," Watts said.
You don't pay taxes on the money going into an HSA, funds grow on tax-deferred, and you can use the money tax-free to pay for qualified medical expenses.

There are now officially a billion Web sites on the Internet (we think)(Internet Live Stats)
The Internet passed a major milestone last week … probably.
According to estimates by Internet Live Stats — and trumpeted by Internet pioneer Tim Berners Lee — the World Wide Web now officially hosts a billion domain names, or roughly one Web site for every three Internet-users on the planet. It’s a profound feat for a technology that’s only been around 20-odd years. And it’s a pretty bold statement on Internet Live Stats’s part, as well: As it turns out, it’s almost impossible to put a number on the ever-shifting Internet.
Since August 1995, a British Internet company called Netcraft has tried . It basically uses a series of bots to ping every Web site, evaluate whether they’re active, and pull the data into a monthly report. ( In August , for instance, Netcraft estimated that 992 million Web sites were online; of those, domains ending in .xyz saw the greatest growth.) Internet Live Stats then runs formulas against those monthly reports that, together with historical data and current projections, informs the site’s “live” counter.
According to that counter, the Internet passed a billion pages on Sept. 17.
But even Peter Collins, Internet Live Stats’s overseer, admits that’s an inexact science — more an educated estimate than an actual “statistic,” with all the open-and-shut authority the word implies. Netcraft’s surveys are not 100-percent conclusive: sending too many requests from bots could overload a server, so Netcraft sometimes just takes a sample and extrapolates from there. Internet Live Stats, meanwhile, has long recorded unpredictable fluctuations in the number of “inactive” sites, which means the Internet could easily be down below 1 billion pages next month. Collins also said the site is missing some data that he said could make its formulas more accurate: He wishes Google would provide better, more timely search data, for instance.
Total number of websites, 2000 to 2014. (Internet Live Stats)
 
Still, the estimate and this particular milestone serve an important role, giving shape to an otherwise boundless, ill-defined Internet. Thanks to estimates from Netcraft, we know that 80 percent of all registered domains are just “parked,” or undeveloped: There’s no actual, unique content on that site. We know that the greatest jump in Web site volume occurred between 2011 and 2012. And over time, Collins thinks, we could know exactly how and when the modern Web developed, and how that’s come to shape our offline world.
“We strongly believe in the value of keeping track of the history of the Internet,” Collins said. “This is something very important because it gives a sense of the development and the usage through its brief history … and ultimately allows us to [understand] the resulting changes in our culture and society.”

Recent Inversion Wave Brings on Slew of Outrage -- What s Nextreddit
Ten years ago, Republicans and Democrats agreed that corporate tax dodging was a problem, and came together to fix it. But large U.S. corporations got trickier -- they sought out new ways to get around paying their taxes on U.S. profits, hiring thousands of tax accountants to take advantage of loopholes in our tax code. The recent fix? Corporate inversions.
Essentially, corporate inversion allows companies to make it look like their U.S. profits are generated abroad, when in fact they are not. By buying out a foreign company and using it as a tax haven, companies that "invert" don't move abroad in any real sense, and continue to benefit from America's infrastructure, education system, security and large consumer market. Average taxpayers, small businesses and larger domestic companies end up footing their tax bill. These offshore loopholes let companies avoid as much as $90 billion worth of taxes each year, according to a U.S. PIRG report . That doesn't seem right.
Last Friday, Sens. Sherrod Brown and Dick Durbin introduced a bill that would dig at an aspect of corporate inversion. It requires companies to "pay what they owe" on the offshore cash that they are hiding the moment it inverts. A couple of weeks ago, Sens. Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin introduced another bill getting at inversion incentives. The legislation comes on the heels of several American companies - including Burger King and Walgreens -- considering moving the address of their headquarters to a foreign subsidiary in order to dramatically shrink their tax bill, using a loophole in the tax code known as "earnings stripping." Companies use this clever accounting trick to essentially load the American part of the company with debt owed to the foreign part of the company, making interest payments tax-deductible and thereby reducing the appearance of American profits.
These bills aren't the only proposals on the table. Sen. Carl Levin's Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, as well as the Stop Corporate Inversions Act and No Federal Contracts for Corporate Deserters Act, are other pieces of legislation on the table to tackle tax avoidance maneuvers. We've seen this time and time again -- bills get introduced, potential cosponsors are prodded, and then nothing happens. So the question remains: What's next?
It's time for things to be different.
Corporations are craftier at finding loopholes in our tax code, but things are changing and there have been some victories of late: Walgreen Co. took into account the deep backlash from its customers, and didn't go through with their inversion deal. Rep. Rosa DeLauro was able to successfully attach an amendment to several appropriations bills that would prohibit any company that inverted in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands from engaging in federal contracts. Both Republicans and Democrats approved of this measure, acting upon their collaboration from 10 years ago, and perhaps paving the way for more bipartisan efforts.
With the recent wave of corporate inversions, now is the time to strike while the iron is hot, and finally act on corporate tax avoidance. While some Members of Congress have shown tremendous support in the effort to curb inversions, we can't forget the bigger picture: Inversions are just one of many loopholes that corporations use to avoid paying their taxes. These bills are all solutions to many pieces to the bigger problem, and must be considered together. Sens. Ron Wyden and Orrin Hatch, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, respectively, should act on the numerous bills, as a collective, and hold corporations accountable to the taxes they should owe.
Companies have gotten smarter at tax dodging. Let's take action, and get ahead of the game.

Economic Growth Patterns in USA  Canada  Mexico and Chinareddit
While the U.S. economy is seeing significant growth, economies in neighboring countries, Canada and Mexico, are doing also well. In Canada, rising exports and consumer spending have translated into better growth. This year, their GDP will grow by about 2.25 percent with a similar boost predicted for 2015 .
Meanwhile to our south, an energy boom is propelling the Mexican economy. The Mexican government's recent decision to allow foreign and domestic companies to explore for and refine oil will prompt Pemex, Mexico's state-owned enterprise, to become more competitive, boosting growth. Also, home building in the country is recuperating, and manufacturing is on the rise as the U.S. and Canadian consumer demand begins to rebound.
This is promising news for U.S. businesses overall since Mexico and Canada are amongst the U.S.' top foreign customers, accounting for $944-billion-plus in exports .
In contrast, China's economic growth is likely to slow in the coming years. Gains will drop to around 6 percent by 2016 from 7 percent in 2015 and 7.3 percent this year . This is a drastic change compared to the double-digit growth China has experienced in the last decade. With bad loans on the rise, the supply of credit from non-traditional lenders such as trust companies has been more limited. Also, falling real estate prices are taking a toll n construction activity and sales, weakening the type of business investments that helped stimulate past growth.
Much of these changes, however, seem to suit Beijing. Officials there think that moderate growth is preferable to additional, riskier, credit-fueled expansion. The government also wants home and rental prices to decrease in order to accommodate average families.
These economic changes pose new opportunities for US companies doing business internationally. The changes are gradual but very promising, and as these developments occur, we as a nation should do everything we can to ensure that the U.S. continue to be a powerful and influential international player. This, as well as the tremendous human capital, that we have will give us the competitive edge for further generations to come. I am bullish about us in the United States and its close neighbors.

Sanjay Jog & Kavita Chowdhury | Mumbai/ New Delhi Sep 22, 2014 07:55 PM IST
The ruling partners Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have decided to hold talks on Tuesday morning on seat sharing arrangement for the election to the 288-member Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. NCP, which had given an ultimatum till today, however, reiterated that it was firm on its demand for 144 seats. NCP also declared that it was against Congress party's proposal of 124 seats for the poll slated for October 25.
Congress is adamant on contesting 174 seats in case alliance works out with NCP. If talks fail, Congress leaders including Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, state party chief Manikrao Thakre and industries minister Narayan Rane have announced party to contest all 288 seats.
Speaking to reporters after the CEC meeting Chavan in New Delhi said: "We are completing our seat selection while talks with NCP are going on at a different level. We are not waiting for the (meeting of) NCP. Discussions with NCP are going on."
NCP's core committee headed by the party president Sharad Pawar held a crucial meeting this afternoon and discussed various options, including going solo. However, the core committee decided to hold yet another round of talks with Congress party on Tuesday morning. NCP leader Praful Patel said Congress party's proposal for 124 seats was not acceptable to NCP. He informed that he held telephonic conversation with Congress party president Sonia Gandhi's political advisor Ahmed Patel.
"NCP is quite keen to survive alliance with Congress in the assembly poll. Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan had called last night for talks. NCP will be represented by state party chief Sunil Tatkare, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, public works minister Chhagan Bhujbal and myself at Tuesday's seat-sharing talks with Congress," Patel said.
However, an NCP leader, who did not want to be identified, admitted that the party was also waiting to see the outcome of talks between BJP-Shiv Sena alliance. ''NCP is prepared to contest all 288 seats and it has already prepared the list of party candidates. If the Congress party relents and decides to give more seats the alliance will survive or else NCP will fight all seats," he said.

MHA orders probe whether Gujarat hotel asked NE staff to stay awayMHA orders probe if Gujarat hotel barred NE staff
PTI  New Delhi, September 22, 2014
First Published: 16:55 IST(22/9/2014) | Last Updated: 22:46 IST(22/9/2014)
The home ministry ordered on Monday a probe into the allegation that employees of northeast origin at an Ahmedabad hotel were asked to stay away during Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent visit to the Gujarat city.
 
Sources said the ministry asked the Intelligence Bureau (IB) to find out the veracity of the order and, if so, who issued it and why.
 
There were also reports that northeast origin employees at a mall in Ahmedabad were asked not to come for duty on the day Xi visited the Gujarat capital last week.
 
The IB has been asked to send its findings by Tuesday after probing the allegations of both the incidents.
 
The sources said that the home ministry ordered the probe taking serious objection to the allegations.
 
Last week, taking umbrage at the reports, Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi had said, "It is an insult to the northeast. They doubted us as if we are not patriots. Are we not citizens of India? This is not good for the region."

Kelsey Juliana comes by her activism naturally -- her parents met in the '90s while fighting the logging industry's destruction of old growth forests and she attended her first protest when she was two months old.
Now just out of high school, she's co-plaintiff in a major lawsuit being spearheaded by Our Children's Trust that could force the state of Oregon to take a more aggressive stance against the carbon emissions warming the earth and destroying the environment. She's walking across America as part of the Great March for Climate Action, due to arrive in Washington, DC, on November 1.
"You don't have to call yourself an activist to act," she says. "I think that's so important that people my age really get [that] into their heads. As a younger person, I have everything to gain from taking action and everything to lose from not... It's important that youth are the ones who are standing up because of the fact that we do have so much to lose."

Sena-BJP alliance on brink but Delhi for soothing touchBJP-Sena tie-up on the brink
Sanjay Jog & Archis Mohan | Mumbai/New Delhi Sep 23, 2014 12:31 AM IST
With neither the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) nor the Shiv Sena willing to yield ground on the number of Assembly seats they want to contest, the alliance between them seems to be on the brink. However, the central leadership of the BJP is trying to salvage the 25-year alliance, fearing repercussions in the Rajya Sabha, where the ruling party does not have a majority. The Sena has three members in the Upper House.
The BJP had already rejected Sena’s last seat- sharing formula of 151:119 for the elections to the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly. The BJP demanded 130 seats. But the Sena is in no mood to relent. While state-level leaders of both the parties have given up on the alliance, the Centre is still counselling patience and wisdom.
Since 1989, no party has contested all the 288 seats in the state alone. Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) was part of the Congress before it was formed in 1999. There are regions where even national parties such as the BJP and the Congress have little or no presence.
But BJP’s state-level leaders, confident that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s magic will help them secure a higher number (of 24 Lok Sabha seats they contested, they won 23, losing only one to former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan) are seeing visions of having a BJP chief minister in Maharashtra’s history.
This is the reason, state BJP leaders say, the alliance is over and that the Central Parliamentary Board has discussed the names of party nominees for all the 288 seats.
State BJP chief Devendra Fadnavis said the Sena was not in a state of mind to hold negotiations. He reiterated the BJP was unable to accept the Sena’s formula.
Curiously, the Sena sought the intervention of Union minister of external affairs Sushma Swaraj to convince the BJP’s central and state leadership to accept 119 seats.
Sena supremo late Bal Thackeray and his son Uddhav had made a pitch for Swaraj’s nomination as the prime ministerial nominee of the National Democratic Alliance but later extended their support to Modi.
In Delhi, party sources neither confirmed nor denied that BJP President Amit Shah spoke to Sena chief on Monday. However, they did complain of Thackeray’s “arrogance”. Sources said Thackeray phoned two senior leaders of BJP before Sunday’s central election committee meeting. They say Thackeray was being highhanded in talking to senior BJP leaders and ignoring state leaders.
Maharashtra polls are on October 15. The last date for filing of nominations is September 27. BJP sources claimed the party had already discussed candidates for 215-seats, and might decide to contest nearly 250 seats if its alliance with Sena comes unstuck.
But the BJP’s central leadership is wary that its opponents could accuse it in the electoral battlefield of being a betrayer of its allies, given its recent break up with Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) and also with Janata Dal (United) in 2013.
However, it is sure of painting Thackeray as “arrogant”, given how he has treated his cousin Raj or senior leaders like Manohar Joshi, Narayan Rane and Suresh Prabhu and was now trying to snap ties with a long time ally.
BJP sources said the party had climbed down from its insistence that both Sena and BJP contest 135 seats each, giving 18 to allies like Republican Party of India (Athavale) and Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathana.
They said party’s Maharashtra unit chief Devendra Fadnavis had proposed that BJP contest 130 seats, Sena 140 and 18 be allocated to other allies.
BJP leadership says the party’s strike rate was better in the 2009 assembly elections when it contested only 119 seats compared to 169 of its ally.
The BJP wants Sena to renegotiate the electoral arrangement on 59-seats that the alliance hasn’t won in the last 15-years. Of these, Sena has never won 40 while BJP’s share is 19.
A leader said all Sena had to do was part with 11-seats from its 40. BJP believes the reason its alliance with Sena couldn’t form a government in the last 15-years is precisely these 59-seats.
“BJP is known as an urban party across India but in Maharashtra it is the Sena which contests urban seats in Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, etc. We are confident of doing well in urban area as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message of good governance has gone to all,” a senior leader said.
The leader also said the party was unlikely to hold any more of its Central Election Committee meetings as its final list is nearly ready.
“We are confident of being the single largest party,” the leader said. The BJP has decided on its slogan in Maharashtra that will liken the good governance of Shivaji's rule with that of Modi's.

Maharashtra polls: BJPs fresh offer of 130 seats to Sena  but ready to goalonePrint

Even as the channels for negotiations with the Shiv Sena are being kept open, the BJP has quietly readied a plan to go without its oldest ally in the coming Maharashtra assembly elections. The party’s top leadership has cleared almost 220 candidates, prepared slogans — for both scenarios — and has already taken the smaller allies into confidence.
Meanwhile, BJP general secretary in charge of Maharashtra Rajiv Pratap Rudy said party president Amit Shah has spoken to Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray . “Shah has spoken to Thackeray, and that itself indicates that we are very eager to continue with the alliance,” he said. He claimed that Shah made a “very liberal offer”, climbing down from the initial demand for 135 seats to 130 seats. He also offered to accept the “worst possible seats” which the Sena has not won in the last 25 years, said Rudy.
“We won’t pull the plug. We are hopeful that a solution will be found. The general consensus (at the party’s central election commission and parliamentary board meetings) was that we want to have an alliance and should work towards it… It would be very disheartening if we have to break the alliance,” said Rudy.
Reducing the demand further, a senior BJP leader in Mumbai said, “If the Sena is ready to give us 126 seats, the alliance stays. Otherwise, consider it the end of the alliance.” But Thackeray continued to keep the BJP hanging. The official response from the Sena office was, “The alliance stays, but the deadlock over seat-sharing continues.”
“At the moment, the status of the Sena-BJP alliance is like that of a patient who is in the ICU,” said Sena MP Sanjay Raut. “It’s on ventilator. But there are cases where patients recover in such critical situations too,” responded a BJP leader.
“We still have to decide on the number of seats. Other things come later,” said central BJP observer O P Mathur. “We have already submitted our proposal — 130 seats for BJP, 140 for Sena and 18 for other allies. We have neither received any formal proposal nor any response from the Sena,” said state BJP chief Devendra Fadnavis.
With the Sena showing no signs of giving in, the BJP has prepared an alternate plan. While both sides had agreed to keep aside 18 seats for the smaller allies — Rashtriya Samaj Party (RSP), Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghana and Republican Party of India (Athawale) — BJP leaders claimed that if the “mahayuti” (grand alliance) in Maharashtra is broken, the smaller parties would remain with it.
Party sources said the BJP, if it goes without continued…

Mizoram Congress leader files FIR over Facebook post by AizawlwomanPrint
Written by Adam Halliday | Aizwal | Posted: September 22, 2014 8:56 pm | Updated: September 22, 2014 8:58 pm
A senior office bearer of the Mizoram Pradesh Youth Congress Committee, or MPYCC, filed an FIR against a woman from Aizawl for a Facebook post in which she alleged a Mizo fugitive and his friends were beaten up in Delhi by two Mizo Congress youth members impersonating plain clothes policemen.
MPYCC secretary R. Lalhmingmawia Ralte filed the FIR at the Aizawl Police Station on Monday against one Lalrinfeli who goes by the Facebook name Felly Jahau.
Ralte said in the FIR someone going by the name Felly Jahau posted an article on the widely-followed “Zoram Politics” Facebook group where she “defamed” the ruling Congress party and mentioned two party leaders who “do not exist.”
The said Facebook post talked about one Michael, a man wanted by Mizoram Police in connection with a case involving allegations of EVM rigging during last year’s state assembly polls, being approached and manhandled by two men in Delhi.
The post alleged the men were impersonating plainclothes policemen but turned out to be youth Congress leaders.
Michael is wanted by police for instigating a well-known Aizawl educationist to make allegations the Congress rigged EVMs using a “powerful radiowave machine” and winning 34 of the state’s 40 assembly seats unfairly.

Alaska reporter quits live on TV
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Well, that's one way to quit your job.
While doing a news segment on the Alaska Cannabis Club, a medical marijuana organization in Alaska, reporter Charlo Greene made a grand exit from her position at CBS affiliate KTVA in Alaska (caution: the video is NSFW).
Greene revealed that she actually owns the marijuana club she was reporting on, and then quit her TV gig with some choice words live on air.
"Now everything you've heard is why I, the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, will be dedicating all of my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska," Greene said on air. "And as for this job, well, not that I have a choice but, f*** it, I quit."
Related: Why it's risky to invest in pot stocks
The fact that Greene was so closely tied to an issue she was reporting on is a conflict of interest that would have forced her to step down, even if she hadn't made a vulgar statement.
The ex-reporter told the Alaska Dispatch News that her dramatic exit was her attempt to bring attention to the issue of marijuana legalization, and apologized for offending anyone.
Not long after the on-air incident, Greene created an Indiegogo campaign to raise funding ahead of the state's November 4 vote on legalizing recreational marijuana.
"As a member of the media, I've seen the dirty campaign tricks and lies that prohibitionists have been using over the past several months to sway Alaskan voters firsthand," she wrote in a statement on the funding site.
Greene also posted a YouTube video explaining her position.
Meanwhile, after Charlo's on-air outburst, KTVA apologized profusely, on air and off.
"We sincerely apologize for the inappropriate language used by a KTVA reporter during her live presentation on the air tonight," KTVA-11's news director Bert Rudman wrote on the station's Facebook page . "The employee has been terminated."
Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Greene's name.

Washington: Modi to stay at President s official guest house during US visit3

New Delhi: Narendra Modi will be the first Indian Prime Minister in over a decade to stay at the US President's guest house, the 190-year-old Blair House, when he travels to Washington on September 29.
Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the last one to stay at the guest house.
"Built as a private home in 1824, Blair House has played an important role in nearly 190 years of American political, diplomatic and cultural history- from Andrew Jackson's 'Kitchen Cabinet', to private chats with Abraham Lincoln, to Harry S Truman's crucial leadership as World War II ended and the Cold War began.
Narendra Modi will be the first Indian Prime Minister in over a decade to stay at the Blair House during his US visit.
#narendra modi #us visit #blair house #atal bihari vajpayee
"Now, as then, US Presidents continue to rely on Blair House as a significant foreign policy tool," as per the official information.
Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh never stayed in the Blair House and always preferred a hotel during his US visits.
The Blair House is the designated guest house of the US president where all his state guests are traditionally known to have stayed.
Located across from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, Blair House has served as the President's Guest House since its purchase by the US government in World War II and under the stewardship of the Department of State, it welcomes visiting heads of states and other top dignitaries.
In New York, Modi, like Singh, will stay at the New York Palace Hotel in Manhattan when he arrives on September 26 late afternoon.
His first public engagement next day would be a visit to Ground Zero, the site of the World Trade Centre which was destroyed in the terror attacks by al-Qaeda in 2001 followed by a visit to the 9/11 Memorial Museum built in the honour of the victims of 2001 attacks.
Modi will then proceed towards the United Nations to deliver the speech at the General Assembly, scheduled in the first half of the day.
The Prime Minister will then have a series of bilateral meetings including one with his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina.
In the evening, Modi is scheduled to visit the Central Park where he will attend Global Citizen festival.

Divestment Isnt the AnswerCommentary about business and finance.

Divestment Isn’t the Answer
To destroy demand for fossil fuels, universities can do a lot better than just selling some stocks.
By Daniel Gross
 
Demonstrators promote the Divest Harvard movement on Oct. 26, 2013, at Harvard University. Universities can do more good on the climate front by investing, however, than divesting.

There’s a nationwide movement afoot on college campuses to have endowments and other pools of philanthropic money divest from fossil fuels—i.e., to sell stocks in companies that mine coal or drill for oil. In May, Stanford decided to dump coal-mining stocks from its endowment. Divest Harvard is urging the Stanford of the East to do the same. Over the weekend, hundreds of thousands of people attending the People’s Climate March in New York City added their voices to the rising chorus. And on Monday—irony alert—a fund controlled by the Rockefeller family, heirs to the Standard Oil fortune, announced it would join the fossil-fuel divestment movement.
Students at Berkeley have urged the University of California to follow suit with its $91 billion endowment. “In the tradition of successful divestment campaigns against the South African apartheid, Sudan, and tobacco, we are targeting the UC Regents and asking for divestment,” the Fossil Free UC campaign urges. “Specifically, Fossil Free UC is asking the university to adopt a five-year plan to freeze new fossil fuel investments, implement a negative screen for the top 194 companies and roll out investment alternatives that address climate-risk and sustainability.” On Sept. 17, however, a committee of the university system’s Board of Regents rejected the call for divestment.
As a kid reporter at the Cornell Daily Sun in the mid-1980s, I covered the heady South Africa divestment protests. The moral case was quite clear: Universities and the people who studied and worked there wanted to reject the repressive apartheid regime. But it’s more complicated with fossil fuels. Pressuring a company to leave a country is a much less complicated proposition—and an easier ask—than asking a company to leave a global industry. And simply selling stock doesn’t actually punish a company much these days. Push a button and sell some shares of Peabody Energy or Exxon Mobil, and they will very likely be snapped up by another investor: an index fund, a mutual fund, perhaps even another college endowment. In the 1980s, it was very easy for individuals to boycott South Africa personally. But even if your university divests its shares in oil and coal companies, it—and you—will continue to provide revenues to many of those exact same companies. Fill up your gas tank at a Mobil station, ride a gasoline-powered university bus, fly home for the holidays, or turn on the university-provided air conditioning or heating, and you’ll be paying companies to find and consume fossil fuels.

Divesting from fossil fuels also poses a complicated investment question. In the 1980s it was very clear which companies were operating plants and factories in South Africa and which were effectively boycotting this small market. Today, it’s harder to clearly identify the fossil-fuel bad guys. Many oil and coal-mining companies are also in the renewable energy business. And what about the utility companies that buy all that coal and burn it? Power producer NRG is one of America’s single largest consumers of coal. But it’s also working on new carbon-capture technology , owns enough solar capacity to run 1 million homes , agreed this spring to buy America’s largest wind farm , and sent employees to the climate march.
By using its financial muscle and consumption power, the University of California is helping to build an industry.
Fortunately, there’s a path for universities and their denizens that is more morally consistent, and more socially and economically useful, than just dumping the shares. Because they are huge economic forces, universities can have a greater influence when they invest (or promise to buy) than when they divest or boycott. Socially conscious consumption can displace the demand for the stuff you don’t like and create demand for the stuff you do like. Institutional purchasing activities and policies help create economic facts on the ground, set standards, and send important market signals. For example, if a university is the dominant employer in a small town and establishes a higher minimum wage, that would likely push the wage floor up throughout the area.
Though it resisted divestment, the University of California is pursuing this more difficult path with energy. It’s a giant system , with 10 campuses and five medical centers, 233,000 students, about 190,000 employees, and thousands of buildings. Powering these facilities and people takes about 250 megawatts of electricity generating capacity, roughly that of a “medium size city,” as the university notes .
(Continued from Page 1 )
Right now, the system’s electricity supply is largely free of coal, if not fossil fuels. It gets about 73 percent of its power supply from natural gas sources. But the University of California is seeking to slash its emissions to 1990 levels and wants to become “carbon neutral” by 2025, which, it says, would it make it the first research university to do so. (Here’s the plan .) That’s an ambitious goal—one that the town of Palo Alto has already achieved . And like Palo Alto, which owns a big chunk of a hydroelectric plant, the University of California is becoming more directly involved with energy markets.
Earlier this year, the system became an “Electric Service Provider,” which lets it function something like a utility: It can buy or generate electricity and then sell it directly to certain large customers. The system plans to act as a centralized purchaser and provider of electricity to several of its units, including the campuses and medical centers in Irvine, San Diego, Santa Cruz, and San Francisco.
Earlier this month, the University of California announced a transaction that it described as “the largest solar energy purchase by any U.S. higher education institution.” It struck a deal with Frontier Renewables to purchase the output of two large solar farms—with a combined capacity of about 80 megawatts—that are currently under development and should be up and running in 2016.
Once those plants come online, several UC campuses and medical centers will get about 60 percent of their electricity from renewable sources, displacing a huge chunk of power generated by fossil fuels. What’s more, virtually every UC campus has its own local program to add renewable energy. “Across the university’s 10 campuses, 11.4 MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has been installed, with an additional 22.9 MW of solar PV planned or in construction within the upcoming year,” the University of California notes. The San Diego campus, for one, has lots of solar panels and a 2.8-megawatt fuel cell , “the largest on any college campus,” that runs on waste methane gas.
By using its financial muscle and consumption power, the University of California is helping to build an industry and create a market, and it’s contributing to the growth of a carbon-free economy. These moves will have a much greater real-world impact than selling off shares of Exxon Mobil. Universities should go ahead and divest if it makes them feel better. But they should realize that it’s a poor use of their financial muscle.
There’s much more that other universities can do. Harvard currently gets about 17 percent of its electricity from renewable sources . Given its resources—an endowment well over $30 billion, the huge growth of renewables in Massachusetts—Harvard could easily do much, much better. Jacking the proportion of renewable electricity up to 60 percent or 70 percent would have a far greater impact on the economy and climate than the divestment strategy advocated by Divest Harvard.
After destroying the demand for fossil fuels to create electricity, universities should work on destroying the demand for fossil fuels to move vehicles. No, Berkeley administrators shouldn’t go out and purchase a fleet of Teslas (and many of them probably own Priuses already). But they might consider investing in electric buses made by Proterra , for example. The purchasing power of universities is a much more powerful force than the moral opprobrium they unleash by selling stocks. I’ll even make a first stab at a snappy slogan, which activists should feel free to improve upon: Don’t demur! Procure!

NEW YORK: US stocks were trading lower heading towards midday on Monday after China's finance minister indicated the country will not increase stimulus measures and US housing data fell short of expectations.
Recent data in China has been weak, leading many analysts to lower their growth forecasts and hope for more aggressive accommodations from the government. In remarks on Sunday, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said China wouldn't dramatically alter its economic policy because of any one economic indicator.
A closely watched gauge of Chinese manufacturing, due on Tuesday, could indicate activity was contracting.
"The China demand story is a new variation of a story we've been worried about for a few months. We get some critical data on it tonight for tomorrow morning," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.
The National Association of Realtors said US existing home sales dropped 1.8 per cent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units, following four straight months of gains. Expectations called for sales increasing to a 5.20 million-unit pace. The PHLX housing sector index was down 1.4 per cent.
The Dow Jones industrial average was falling 61.28 points, or 0.35 per cent, to 17,218.46, the S&P 500 was losing 13.7 points, or 0.68 per cent, to 1,996.7 and the Nasdaq Composite was dropping 52.01 points, or 1.14 per cent, to 4,527.78.
In the latest round of merger activity, Sigma-Aldrich
shares were up 33.5 per cent to $136.62 as the best performer on the S&P 500 after German drugs and chemicals maker Merck KGaA agreed to acquire Sigma-Aldrich for $17 billion in cash to boost its life science business.
Yahoo shares were trading down 5.5 per cent to $38.69. The stock was downgraded by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and by Bernstein in the wake of the Alibaba Group debut Friday. Alibaba shares were down 3.2 per cent to $90.90.
Dresser-Rand shares were up 2.6 per cent to $81.99 after Germany's Siemens agreed to buy the US oilfield equipment maker for $7.6 billion in cash. The stock had rallied more than 17 per cent last week in anticipation of the deal.
Among the largest per centage gainers on the New York Stock Exchange was Kemet, up 11.9 per cent after its second-quarter outlook, while the largest per centage decliner was CARBO Ceramics, down 18.86 per cent.
Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Alibaba , down 4.04 per cent to $90.10; Bank Of America, up 0.91 per cent to $17.10 and Vale SA ADR, down 4.48 per cent to $11.46.

Mumbai: The Bombay High Court on Monday sought a response from Maharashtra government and Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai on a public interest litigation seeking a CID probe into 'a scam' regarding use of antibiotic drugs at civic hospitals.
A division bench, headed by Justice PV Hardas, issued notices to the state home ministry, public health department and the MCGM, seeking replies in four weeks.
On August 18, several patients at a hospital run by MCGM suffered reactions after two antibiotics were administered to them through injections.

The PIL, filed by former journalist Ketan Tirodkar, says that of the 45 patients who were administered these drugs, 28 suffered severe reactions. One of them, Saira Shaikh, died.
Earlier this month, 18 children at a civic-run hospital in Bhiwandi near Thane suffered similar reactions. Also, in August, patients at an MCGM hospital in Ghatkopar complained of chills and abdominal pain after being injected with the two antibiotics.
MCGM has formed a panel to investigate the issue. However, Tirodkar alleges a drug cartel has developed a nexus with Food and Drug Administration officials and politicians. He seeks probe by the crime investigation department and registration of a case against the FDA officials, hospital authorities and the drug companies.

New Delhi: State-owned Coal India (CIL) is in the process of identifying places for setting up of solar projects worth Rs 7,000 crore. "Coal India is in the process of identifying places for setting up the solar projects," a source said. "The directions for the same were given to the company a couple of days ago. CIL is working on them," the source added.
The source, however, refused, to give more details stating that the "initiative was at a very early stage." CIL is in talks with the New and Renewable Energy Ministry for setting up a combined capacity of 1,000 MW.
On an average, Rs 7 crore per megawatt is incurred in setting up a solar power plant. The solar initiative is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to provide 24x7 electricity to push ahead economic growth.
CIL is in talks with the New and Renewable Energy Ministry for setting up a combined capacity of 1,000 MW.
#cil #coal india #coal #economy growth
The government is expecting $100 billion investment in the renewable energy sector in the next four years as it firms up a new policy framework. Renewables account for more than 70,000 MW of the country's total installed power generation capacity of over 2,50,000 MW.
Renewable energy generation worldwide is projected to rise by 45 per cent and account for about 26 per cent of global electricity generation by 2020. Coal India, which accounts for over 80 per cent of the domestic coal production, produced 462 million tonnes (MT) of coal in the last fiscal, missing its target of 482 MT.

Mass. D.A. drops charges against protesters -- because he agrees with their political opinionsBy Eugene Volokh September 22 Follow @volokhc
Jeff Jacoby (Boston Globe) has a column on the incident (which happened two weeks ago, but which I just heard about last week), and I agree that the D.A.’s actions are appalling. As WBUR-FM reported ,
Defendants John O’Hara and Ken Ward were scheduled to go on trial for using a lobster boat to block freighter loaded with 40,000 tons of coal that was bound for the Brayton Point Power Station in Somerset. It’s a charge the climate activists do not deny. They would argue that the threat of global warming is so great, the two men had to act.
That’s unusual enough. But then the bigger surprise came when Bristol County District Attorney Sam Sutter dropped the most serious charges against O’Hara and Ward. And, in front of a cheering crowd, Sutter said he agreed with the protesters.
Here’s a quote from D.A. Sam Sutter :
The decision that Robert Kidd and I, that['s] the Assistant District Attorney who handled this case, reached today was a decision that certainly took into consideration the cost to the taxpayers in Somerset, but was made with our concern for their children, the children of Bristol County and beyond in mind. Climate change is one of the gravest crises our planet has ever faced.
Now the D.A. has said that he thinks the protesters broke the law :
I have a great sympathy with what these two gentlemen did, but I do disagree with their action, obviously, because it broke the law.
Yet because “this was an act of civil disobedience,” Sutter said, “this should be treated as a civil infraction.” According to PRI’s quote of one of the protesters, the protesters were required only to “pay $2,000 restitution to the Somerset police and the state police for their overtime charges essentially.”
And it seems pretty clear that Sutter wasn’t just announcing a general policy that “civil disobedience” (for instance, when people blockade abortion clinics out of moral conviction) should generally “be treated as a civil infraction” even when it may constitute a crime. Sutter was acting as he did because he agreed with the protesters’ policy views, and the protesters’ sense that their policy positions were important and urgent.
So the message is clear: If you are engaging in legal behavior that Bristol County D.A. Sam Sutter sufficiently dislikes, and people are criminally interfering with this behavior, don’t expect the criminal law to protect you by deterring such misbehavior; and if you are committing a crime to express a viewpoint that D.A. Sutter likes, you could be free of criminal prosecution. Next stop — no criminal prosecution of people who blockade fur shops? Gun stores? Any other business that the D.A. believes isn’t worthy of full legal protection?

Reliance’s D1, D3 fields may not get benefit of new gas price
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, September 22:  
Reliance Industries Ltd-BP-Niko Resources partners in the Krishna Godavari Basin acreage may not get advantage of new gas price for their producing fields – D-1, D-3 – in the D6 block.
The Ministry for Petroleum and Natural Gas is expected to have clarity on the new price for domestically produced gas by September 30. Sources in the know of the development said that the Cabinet proposal circulated by the Oil Ministry seeks new price for domestically produced natural gas. But Reliance’s D6 producing fields will be treated separately.
This is because the contractors are already in arbitration with the Government on two issues – proposed cost recovery by the Government for RIL-BP-Niko not being able to meet the committed output from the fields, and delay in implementation by the Government of the “Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guideline 2014” notified on January 10. “The report submitted by the senior official level panel had been discussed over the weekend and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs is now ready to take it up. There will be complete clarity on the gas price by September 30,” a Government official said.
The official declined to state whether the gas pricing issue will be taken up at the CCEA meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for the US visit on September 26, leaving little time for the CCEA to take up the matter.
RIL and its partners in D6 block have been criticised for not being able to contain the fall in output from D-1 and D-3 fields of the KG block after it had hit a peak of 61 million standard cubic metre a day (mmscmd). The current output from D-1, D-3 and MA fields in the block is about 12 mmscmd.
While deferring its decision to implement the new gas price by three months on June 25, the Government had said that the new price will be in place by September 30. It had constituted an inter-ministerial official panel comprising secretaries of Power, Fertiliser and Expenditure and Additional Secretary of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas as the member secretary. The committee submitted its report last week, which had to be discussed by an informal panel of ministers. It is expected that the new price of domestically produced gas will hover around $6/unit-$7/unit.

SEZs need stable policy regime, FTP benefits
New Delhi, September 22:  
Investments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) declined as a result of introduction of Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) and Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) which led to negative investor sentiments, a study commissioned by the Commerce Ministry has said.
Moreover, products manufactured in the zones have become non-competitive in the domestic tariff area (rest of the country) due to high import duty structure and zero or lower tariffs due to free trade agreements, the study titled ‘SEZs in India-Issues and Way Forward’ carried out by research body ICRIER highlighted.
“SEZ units are rather at a disadvantageous position as they are not eligible for benefits under the Foreign Trade Policy,” the study said. To make SEZs attractive again for investors, both domestic and foreign, the study, by ICRIER Professor Arpita Mukherjee, has recommended aligning the SEZ policy with the Foreign Trade Policy so that units in the zone, too, can benefit from incentives given to exporters.
It also advocated a stable policy regime, single window clearance, linking SEZs with the National Investment Manufacturing Zone policy, more focussed investments in the zones and greater accountability of development commissioners.
The Finance and Commerce Ministries are, at present, engaged in devising a package to boost SEZs which has seen a downturn following introduction of taxes in 2012. The Finance Ministry has not yet agreed to restore tax benefits as it believes that they will lead to considerable revenue loss.
Dismissing the notion of SEZs being tax havens, the study pointed out that fiscal incentives are given by all countries and not specific to Indian SEZs.
“Revenue foregone due to direct tax exemptions is only 0.3 per cent of GDP (2013-14) and 12 per cent of total revenue foregone due to direct taxes. Revenue foregone due to indirect tax exemptions does not count as loss since DTA exporters also get export concession benefits,” it said.

In spite of reverses  Anil Agarwal has big aluminium plansIn spite of reverses, Anil Agarwal has big aluminium plans
Dillip Satapathy | Bhubaneswar Sep 22, 2014 10:30 PM IST
Vedanta Resources Chairman Anil Agarwal, after his meeting with Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik at Bhubaneswar recently, announced that his Lanjigarh alumina refinery would raise its production capacity from one million tonne per annum to two million tonne within a year and then gradually ramp it up to six million tonne. Agarwal also pitched for revving up the idle aluminium capacity of the 0.5 million tonne smelter at Jharsuguda in western Odisha. Apart from that, he has a 1.25 million tonne smelter with SEZ (special economic zone) status, which is lying idle for the last three years pending resolution of certain issues with the state government over sourcing of power to run the unit. He expects to get this aluminium capacity going too.
The announcement baffled many - Agarwal has maintained that it's a struggle to keep the Lanjigarh refinery afloat amidst acute raw material shortage. The refinery, located in the backward Kalahandi district, was built in August 2007 on the assurance of bauxite from the nearby Niyamgiri mines of Odisha Mining Corporation. But due to protracted protests by local tribes and green activists, the Union ministry of environment and forest withdrew the mining clearances, dealing a severe blow to the Lanjigarh unit which now runs on bauxite sourced outside the state. The Lanjigarh alumina refinery, as well as the aluminium smelter at Jharsuguda, is currently running at 25 per cent of their installed capacity, Agarwal said at Bhubaneswar.
If it is so, what is the logic behind going for capacity expansion, especially when there is no solution in sight to overcome the bauxite issues? "On the surface it may look queer. But it is the global outlook for alumina/aluminium that has encouraged Agarwal to go for capacity expansion even without any raw material security," says R P Panda, an analyst. With the LME (London Metal Exchange) prices of aluminium hovering around $2,100 per tonne, up from $1,700 a year ago, it is viable to go for the expansion even with imported bauxite, he reasons.
Work in progress
The investment into fresh capacity makes sense for Agarwal because most of the capital expenditure has already been committed. The total investment grounded by Vedanta at Lanjigarh and the aluminium and power complex in Jharsuguda through its subsidiary, Sesa Sterlite (earlier Vedanta Aluminium), is pegged at about Rs 52,000 crore. In fact, the work on the expansion of Lanjigarh alumina refinery from one million tonne to six million tonne had started a few years back before it was halted by an order of the Union ministry of environment and forests.
"Most of the equipment for the expansion had been procured and 50 to 60 per cent of the construction work was over," says a company official. Instead of letting the equipment rust, it is prudent to go ahead with the expansion and make some money in the current bullish market, particularly when the project has received the nod of the locals at a recent public hearing for environment clearance, he adds. "As Vedanta wants to unblock its idle smelter capacity at Jharsuguda and attain two million tonne output in next couple of years, it needs more alumina and that necessitates the expansion of Lanjigarh plant," Panda adds.
Though the LME price of the metal hovers around $2,100 dollar per tonne, there is a premium of $300-400 for quality and other product parameters. This brings the selling price of aluminium to about $2,500 dollar per tonne, when the cost of production, even with imported bauxite, is pegged at $1700-1,800 per tonne. Hence, there is good amount of incentive to push for expansion, without much of fresh cap-ex burden. Had the company owned a bauxite mine, the cost of production would have been further down: around $1,200 per tonne. This underscores the substantial profits other aluminium makers, especially those with captive mines, are making in these good times, Panda says.
Vedanta bears an extra cost of Rs 1,200-1,500 per tonne of bauxite, depending on its source. The bauxite hauled from Gujarat costs about Rs 1,500 per tonne, while it is Rs 1,800 per tonne if imported from places like Guinea or Australia. While imports meet about 30 per cent of the bauxite need of the Lanjigarh plant, the company's own mines in Chhattishgarh supply another 30 per cent. The rest is procured from the states of Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.
With the present capacity and constraints, the company has stepped up efforts to increase the output of Lanjigarh refinery, which now meets 60 per cent of the alumina requirement of the operational smelter at Jharsuguda. The company imports about one million tonne of alumina to feed the Jharsuguda and Korba smelters. If the idle 1.25 million tonne aluminium capacity at Jharsuguda is operationalised, the alumina requirement would go up further. Even after the doubling of the Lanjigarh plant to two million tonne in about a year, the company would still be importing about two million tonne of alumina to produce its projected two million tonne of aluminium per annum.
Depending on imports
Can this state of running the plant on imported bauxite (for alumina refinery) and alumina (for aluminium smelter) be sustainable in the long run? "No," says Agarwal. The metal market is cyclic in nature. The LME metal price could be high now. But when it comes down, it will not be viable to operate without captive mines. "Moreover, the Odisha government had assured to give us raw material linkage, based on which we have invested in the state," adds Agarwal. After being denied the promised Niyamgiri bauxite deposits, Vedanta had applied for 26 alternative mines in a radius of 50 to 60 km of Lanjigarh. There is no progress on that. Only recently, the state government has assured the company to give a small mine at Majhingamali, holding just 20 million tonne of bauxite, but the necessary recommendation to the Centre in this regard is yet to be made. The government, meanwhile, has allotted three laterite (rocks with low alumina content) mines in the Koraput district with a combined deposit of three to five million tonnes, which can at best meet the Lanjigarh plant's one year requirement at the present capacity.
In this backdrop, Vedanta pins its hopes on an arrangement with Larsen & Toubro (L&T) to overcome the raw material issue. Two years back, it had bought Dubal's stake in a joint-venture of L&T that was allotted prospecting license for the Sijimali and Kutrumali bauxite deposits in Odisha, which have reserves of close to 300 million tonne. Through this pact, Vedanta wanted to source bauxite for its Lanjigarh plant. However, the state government is yet to approve the idea, as it holds that the mine was allotted to L&T for setting up of an alumina refinery, so the bauxite from there cannot be diverted to another plant. However, some legal opinions have favoured the L&T-Vedanta pact. The government is still examining the proposal. Particularly, with the past allegations of the Opposition about the government showing favours to Vedanta, the government wants to play it safe.
More trouble
Similarly, revving up the idle aluminium capacity in Jharsuguda SEZ is also fraught with trouble. The Odisha government is not allowing Vedanta to use the power generated at its 2,400 Mw plant, sitting next to the smelter, on the ground that the project is an Independent Power Producer and not a Captive Power Plant. The state government has slapped a cross subsidy surcharge of Rs 1.58 per unit for use of the power for the smelter, forcing the company not to go for commercial operation and keep the 1.25 million tonne aluminium capacity idle. "If we pay the surcharge, it will have an annual impact of Rs 800 to Rs 1000 crore per annum, which is unviable," says a company official.
The company, meanwhile, has approached the government with a request to slash the surcharge rate and hopes an amicable solution to the issue will be reached, which will help revive the idle capacity.
In his presentation before the chief minister, Agarwal emphasised on the benefits to accrue to the state if the problems related to power supply to smelter and bauxite linkage are resolved. He said Vedanta has made a cumulative contribution of Rs 4,030 crore to the Odisha exchequer. In the last fiscal, it made a contribution of Rs 750 crore. If the alumina/aluminium operations are ramped up to full capacity, the contribution could go up to Rs 2,500 crore per annum. Similarly, the direct and indirect employment in the company's facilities at Jharsuguda and Lanjigarh, which is about 25,000 now, would go up to 100,000. Besides, this will trigger 100 downstreamindustriescreating another 100,000 jobs.
Maybe Vedanta, with its grand expansion plans despite the odds, will show the way to realise the goal.

Puri Oil Mills to raise funds for hydropower projectPuri Oil Mills to raise funds for hydropower project
Vijay C Roy | Chandigarh Sep 22, 2014 08:46 PM IST
Puri Oil mills Ltd, the flagship company of North India-based Puri Group, is planning to raise funds for its hydropower project to be set up in Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh.
The total project cost of the 14-megawatt (MW) power project is around Rs 140 crore and the company is contemplating various options such as joint venture, developmental funds and private equity, among others.
Puri Oil Mills Ltd's Managing Director Vivek Puri told Business Standard, "We are planning to expand into hydroelectricity, which is a capital intensive business. We have received techno-economic clearance for running the Uhl River project, going to be set up at Uhl in Mandi District of Himachal Pradesh. The total capacity of the project will be 14 megawatts and the estimated cost is Rs 140 crore. Negotiations are in progress with globally renowned infrastructure companies for both technical and financial collaboration for the project,"
"We are looking at various options such as joint venture, developmental funds from various institutions and private equity, among others, for funding the project. We hope to complete the process in the next couple of months," he added. The company intends to commence the project through a special purpose vehicle and has a target to complete the project by 2017.
Puri Oil mills owns seven small hydropower projects spread across Himachal Pradesh and Haryana, with a total capacity of 31 MW. Out of these, 2 projects in Haryana - at Yamunanagar and Karnal, each having an installed capacity of 1.40 MW - and one at Kullu in Himachal Pradesh with a total capacity of 2 MW have already been commissioned and are running successfully.
In addition to this, the company intends to set up a hydropower project at Kullu (7.50 MW), Karnal (2.1 MW) and Yamunanagar(2.15 MW). All of these projects are at the techno-economic clearance stage.
Puri Oil mills has interests in edible oil, animal feed and hydropower generation. It makes the P Mark brand of mustard oil, which is the market leader across the northern region and has a sizable presence in eastern India. The company has crushing capacity of 60,000 tonnes per annum, with factories in Moga (Punjab), Damtal (Himachal Pradesh) and Bahadurgarh (Haryana).
The company diversified into the renewable energy sector in the year 2006 and started exploring hydropower investment opportunities in the country.

Youth slapped with sedition charges for not standing to national anthem  getsbailPrint
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: September 22, 2014 10:29 pm
Kerala high court on Monday granted bail to a youth, who was arrested and slapped with sedition charge because he did not stand up during the national anthem in a movie theatre.
M Salman, 25, was charged under section 124 A of the IPC (sedition) for allegedly “sitting and hooting” when the national anthem was being played at a movie theatre on August 18. He also faced charges under section 66 A of the IT Act for allegedly posting a derogatory comment about the national flag on Facebook.
Salman was arrested on August 20. Five others were also facing the sedition charge. One of them had obtained anticipatory bail three weeks back.
While granting the bail, single bench of Justice A Hariprasad observed that there was no offence amounting to the security of the nation against the alleged accused. The prosecution has not produced any report showing that Salman was involved in any criminal case.
The court ordered the release of Salman on bail on bond of two sureties of Rs 2 lakh each. He should not intimidate the witnesses or meddle in the investigation. Salman has to appear before the investigating officer twice in a week. He has to surrender his passport, if any, in the magistrate court.
Salman’s arrest on charges of sedition has created an outrage in Kerala from human rights activists. Reacting to the case, CPI (M) general secretary Prakash Karat has demanded that sedition charge (IPC 124 A) should be removed from the Indian Penal Code and the section 66 A of the IT Act be amended to protect the freedom of speech in social media.
In an article in CPI (M) mouthpiece Deshabhimani on Thursday, Karat said as long as section 124 A continues in the Indian Penal Code, it (the sedition charge) would be used for wrong purposes. The IT act should be amended to prevent the suppression of social media and protect the freedom of expression in internet.

SMW Mumbai: Social media has changed political discourse like neverbeforeThe panel was moderated by Indian Express New Media head Anant Goenka.

Social media has changed the political campaign and discourse in India like never before, agreed a panel discussing the learnings from the Lok Sabha elections and the last two US elections as part of the Social Media Week Mumbai on Monday.
The panel was hosted by The Indian Express Group as part of the Social Media Week, being organised simultaneously in many cities across the world.
While Maharashtra Health Minister and Congress leader Suresh Shetty accepted that social media will play a role in all future elections, he said the biggest impact of social media in India would be in how it has allowed people to ask direct questions to their elected representatives.
BJP MP Poonam Mahajan said that while social media is a good platform to reach out, she also went to every galli-mohalla as part of the campaign. “You have to ensure that the real and virtual connect in some way,” she said, while adding that all BJP leaders have been asked to open social media accounts and use it effectively to engage with their voters.
On what the US can teach us, MSNBC journalist Richard Lui said the 2008 Obama camoiagn was more about saying “we know how to use social”, while the next election showed which one of them could go out and swing an election. “In India, May 2014 was a good indicator of a succesful social media campaign, but the next elections will show who is able to go ahead and use this data to win an election,” Lui added.
However, Gautam Chikermane, New Media head at Reliance Industries, countered Twitter India head Rishi Jaitley calling May 2014 a Twitter election. “A lot of Twitter was loose conversartions, some of which got picked up by traditional media who did their due dillegence and raised it as an issue. To call this a Twiter election would be stretching it a bit,” he said.
While there was consensus that politicians were changing in the social media age, Lui summarised that as politicians were adding muscle, so where their voters thanks to social media platforms. The panel was moderated by Indian Express New Media head Anant Goenka.
Earlier in the day, Group M South Asia CEO C V L Srinivas highlighted the growing might of social media in India by elaborating how while the top english language newspaper in India had just 7.5 million readers every day, Facebook has over 11 million daily active users.
However, advertising professional, marketer and investor Mahesh Murthy put things in perspective by saying that a brand like Apple did not have a Facebook or Twitter presence but was connecting with its target audience pretty well. “You don’t need a social media agency or social media strategy if you have a good product,” he said, adding that paying for likes or social media growth was defeating continued…

Two US planes turn back to Dallas after technicalissuesPrint
PTI | Houston | Posted: September 22, 2014 10:05 pm
Two American Airlines passenger planes with a total of 382 people on board flew back to Dallas airport on Monday because of technical issues.
The passenger jets landed safely at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport within two minutes of each other, CNN reported.
Flight 1359 made an emergency landing at 12:21 a.m. after the pilot was alerted to a mechanical issue, airline spokeswoman Laura Masvidal said.
The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 plane had left for Fresno, California, with 140 passengers and five crew members an hour earlier.
Masvidal did not say what the mechanical issue was, the report said.
The second flight, AAL 997, was over the Gulf of Mexico on its way to Buenos Aires, Argentina, when a problem with pressurisation turned up.
The Boeing 777-200, carrying 223 passengers and 14 crew members, turned back to have the issue checked out but did not have to make an emergency landing, Masvidal said. It arrived at 12:23 a.m.
Both planes landed safely, and the flights were rescheduled for later times, the report said.

Huge King fire in California is now bigger than AtlantaBy Mark Berman September 22 Follow @markberman
A wildfire sweeping through parts of California's Sierra Nevada mountains has destroyed 10 homes and is threatening thousands of other structures. (Reuters)
Wildfires continue to ravage  large stretches of California, with thousands of firefighters deployed to battle half a dozen blazes scattered across the state.
The biggest of these remains the gigantic King fire , which has now grown to cover more than 87,500 acres (or about 136 square miles). To put this in perspective, that means the fire is now larger than the cities of Atlanta, Las Vegas, Philadelphia and Portland.

Most of the land that has been burned in the King Fire is on the grounds of the Eldorado National Forest, officials say. Last week, a stretch of the forest was closed due to the fire.
But as the fire has grown , it has also begun to burn homes and other buildings. The King fire has destroyed 10 residences and another 22 structures so far, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (or Cal Fire) said Sunday. And another 21,000 structures remain threatened.

Police arrested Wayne Allen Huntsman last week and charged him with arson in connection to this fire, setting his bail at $10 million. They have provided few details about Huntsman or the investigation, but said they do not think anyone else was involved in setting the fire.
About 2,800 people have been evacuated due to this blaze, which began on Sept. 13 to the east of Sacramento. The fire grew considerably last week, and it nearly tripled in size when it jumped from about 27,000 acres on Wednesday night to about 73,000 acres on Thursday night.
Cal Fire is responding to six major wildfires across the state, with about 6,500 firefighters deployed on Monday. Most of them are fighting the King blaze, which is currently about 18 percent contained.
Weather conditions on Monday should help prevent the fire from growing considerably on Monday night, as higher humidity could slow any potential spread, officials said.
California has seen a significant uptick in wildfires  this year, with more of them occurring than during an average year, according to Cal Fire. Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has declared a state of emergency due to the fires. The catastrophic drought has played a key role in the growth of these wildfires, leaving bone-dry grass and brush that can easily burn and let the fires get stronger.
Cal Fire also reported that the Boles fire in Siskiyou County, which has burned nearly 500 acres since Sept. 15, has been fully contained.
