Patient non-adherence: Perceived challenge or next big opportunityPatient non-adherence: Perceived challenge or next big opportunity

As regulatory hurdles increase and product pipelines shrink, pharmaceutical companies must identify new revenue drivers to maintain growth. Addressing patient non-adherence and thereby improving health outcomes, seems like a popular answer to the problem, yet improving patient adherence is an incommodious task.
As per a 2013 study by 'Cutting Edge Information', pharma companies in the US alone are trying to fight non-adherence costs of more than $290 billion, as almost 50 per cent of patients in the US don't take their medications as prescribed. Considering the socio-economic condition of patients in India, we can safely assume the non-adherence percentage to be higher in the emerging economies.
Let's take an example of patients with Type-2 Diabetes, who do not produce enough insulin to convert blood sugar (glucose) into energy, causing glucose levels to build up in their body. Effective management of Type-2 Diabetes, which includes up to 90 per cent of all diabetes cases, usually involves a multi-pronged approach that includes drug therapies and lifestyle changes. The challenge for primary care physicians (PCPs) is getting patients to adhere to the plan. A recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that between 33 per cent and 48 per cent of Diabetes patients did not meet targets for blood pressure, glycaemia control, or low-density lipoprotein levels.
Without making the article too scientific, let's explore what are the reasons for patients not adhering to the prescribed dosage:
a. Drug companies have limited direct contact with patients, compared to payers and pharmacists, and have struggled with how and when to intervene to make sure patients take their medications
b. All the patients don't really understand the value of adhering to the prescribed dosage of drugs by their doctors
c. Patients' inability to adhere to the prescribed dosage for genuine reasons such as forgetfulness etc.
d. In some cases, even the cost of medicines / treatments, make the patients not take medicines, as soon as they start feeling little better
e. Some patients even claim that their doctors don't spend enough time, explaining them about the requirements and importance of completing the full dose
Interventions have mostly centred on free drugs, reminders, or lower co-pays. But in Western European countries, such as the Netherlands, where medications are fully covered, adherence is still a major issue. We are yet to witness a winner, that is Made-in-India but, globally, a few companies have come up with innovative business ideas to tackle this issue.
Using reward mechanism (GAMIFICATION): Digital health start-up HealthPrize, rewards patients frequently and in small increments. It is working with patients recruited in collaboration with the pharmaceutical companies, and links its site to co-pay cards offered by drug companies through doctors. Patients who respond to reminders receive a variable number of points; they score additionally for engaging in educational quizzes pertaining to their disease. Patients receive the bulk of their points at refill, and rewards are determined by the pharmaceutical company. They can range from an Amazon to an iTunes gift card.
Using Predictive Algorithms: Another start-up RxAnte uses predictive algorithms to help its clients-pharmacy benefit managers and Medicare plans, hone in on patients, most likely to stop taking their prescriptions. RxAnte has drilled so far through a few years of claims data, such as age, sex, race, and clinical history, and assigned individual patients a score which predicts their likelihood of adherence.
Hardware-centric vs. software-only: Developers in the adherence space tend to break down the market into- a) software-only offerings (really cheap and marginally effective) like Smartphone apps and b) hardware-centric offerings, like smart pill bottles and caps, which are more expensive. Trials of hardware solutions, have shown increased adherence than a pure software play. Software solutions are much easier to scale, allowing them to target larger patient populations and to be rolled out more cheaply and easily. But, the biggest problem with software solutions is that using an app isn't part of the normal process of taking a pill. It's an added behaviour, which means to start using it requires a behaviour change.
Co-creation with the pharmaceutical companies, instead of developing solutions in silos:
a. AdhereTech's (smart pill bottle-maker) first pilot focuses on HIV medication, which is expensive, often complicated, and can be a matter of life or death for a patient.
b. Care4Today's (of Janssen Healthcare) new app wants to allow the user to track even vitamins and bottled water. Pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to subsidize that kind of adherence, but consumers might pay a little for it.
c. Ai Cure- a software company that uses a mobile device's webcam to interact with a patient and make sure they're taking their medication- has an advantage with drugs for mental illness.
Ai Cure and AdhereTech are taking different approaches technically, but they both boil down to monitoring a patient's medication behaviour in order to change it through outside motivation. That's been the pattern for a long time, and companies with those sorts of approaches do have some success. I believe, companies shall focus on two areas- a) creating a hardware + software mix solution and b) co-create with the pharma companies, with focus on some therapeutic area(s).
Patient-centric approach
a. Nightingale takes in data from all kinds of consumer devices like Fitbit and Jawbone and combines that data and GPS data from the phone, with a medication tracking calendar. E.g. it learns that a patient takes his medications when he gets to the gym every single day. Nightingale will set up a GPS alarm so if the patient goes to the gym at six one morning or ten another morning, the alarms come in at the right time.
b. CyberDoctor's PatientPartner app that make patients think more about the effect taking their medication has on their overall health by playing through a role-playing game. A small clinical trial showed it increased adherence from 58 per cent to 95 per cent, just even three months after patients used the app.
In my personal opinion, there are a few critical questions companies need to ask before devising successful adherence processes- Are the drugs expensive? Is it extremely critical that patients take their drugs? Are there major negative consequences when patients don't take their drugs? Have the prescribers clearly understood the required dosage? Are the windows for taking these drugs rather tight?
There's a place in the market for a wide variety of adherence approaches, be it apps, smart bottles, smart caps, or smart pills. As it appears, if non-adherence is essentially a behaviour change problem, that's something of a catch-22 and it is in the hands of the patients to feel and decide to change. Companies that succeed will show value to patients above and beyond making sure they take their pills.

Retirement fund manager Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has postponed the November 11 meeting of its apex decision making body, the Central Board of Trustees (CBT), which was scheduled to discuss and approve audit as well as annual report for 2013-14.
The EPFO trustees have to approve the audit and annual report  every year before December 10 for tabling the documents in the  Parliament during Winter Session.
"The 205th meeting of the CBT scheduled to be held on November 11 has been postponed. The next date of meeting shall be informed shortly," said a circular of the EPFO.
During the next meeting, the trustees body headed by the Labour Minister will also review the EPFO's ambitious Universal Account Number (UAN) project under which a portable permanent provident fund account number is being provided to about five crore subscribers of the social security scheme.
UAN is a portable PF account. After getting UAN, the formal sector  workers would not have to apply for the transfer of PF accounts on  changing jobs. UAN will be a permanent and portable account number for  lifetime of the members.
Besides, the CBT may deliberate on tweaking its investment norm to improve the returns on the provident fund deposits by its over five crore subscribers.
An EPFO senior official said the meeting is being called mainly for discussing and approving the audit and annual report of the body for the previous financial year.

Coal India on Saturday reported over 28 per cent fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,192 crore in the second quarter of this fiscal due to higher expenses.
The world's largest coal miner had clocked a profit of Rs 3,052 crore in the same quarter previous year, the company said in a Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) filing.
Its net profit took a beating as the company's Q2 expenses rose by almost 8 per cent as compared to the flat growth in sales in the review period.
Total expenses increased to Rs 14,144 crore in the July-September quarter of this year from Rs 13,112 crore in the same period last year.
The bulk of the expenses were on employee benefits, on which the company spent Rs 7,286 crore, while contractual expenses went up to Rs 1,626 crore from 1,393 crore.
Its net sales increased marginally to Rs 15,677 crore from Rs 15,411 crore in the review period.
Coal India's production increased by 5 per cent at 102.42 million tonnes during the second quarter of this year, compared ot 97.60 million tonnes. Offtake was 110.42 million tonnes compared with 109 million tonnes in review period.
The miner accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal production. Its output stood at 462.42 million tonnes in the previous year.

Central govt to push for BPOs in small towns  citiesCentral government to push for BPOs in small towns, cities

The central government has decided to set up Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) centres in small towns across the country to boost their economic development, Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad said in Patna on Saturday.
"I have directed my officials to formulate guidelines regarding establishing BPO centres in small towns and cities across India like Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Sagar and similar places in Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal," Prasad said.
Tax exemptions would be provided under the new guidelines for BPOs and the process for opening them would be liberalised, he said, adding this would be done adhering to BJP's Lok Sabha poll manifesto to focus on the development of Eastern and Northeastern region.
Pitching for eight to 10 BPOs in Patna, he said proper power and connectivity would be needed for such projects.
Prasad was addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone of an incubation facility at the Software Technology Park (STP). It would cost Rs 10 crore, and would be ready in 18 months.
The minister sought more STPs in different parts of Bihar and said the central government wanted to open them at Bhagalpur and Darbhanga. He requested Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who was also at the dais, to provide land for it.
Manjhi, on his part, said the state government was ready to provide land for STPs at Bhagalpur and Darbhanga engineering colleges.
Expressing happiness at this, Prasad said if the state government provides land, his ministry would open branches of National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT) at Muzaffarpur and Buxar in the state.

US fast food chain Burger King Worldwide will open about 12 outlets in the country over the next 60-90 days, Rajeev Varman, chief executive of the hamburger chain's India unit said on Saturday.
The chain announced last year a tie-up with the Everstone Group to develop the Burger King brand presence in the country.
In India, the hamburger chain has changed its menu to sell mutton, chicken and veggie sandwiches.
"In the long run, India is going to be one of the largest markets globally. Burger King most certainly sees India as one of the biggest opportunities in the future," Varman said ahead of the chain's first store opening in New Delhi.
Burger King is a late entrant in the country. Rival McDonald's Corp has been around for close to two decades and has already grown its network in tier two and three cities.
"Turkey, China and Russia are each growing by around 100 restaurants a year. Here in India, we will set up our first few restaurants and use that to fine-tune our operating model before determining our growth plans," Varman said in an email.

Gold  silver bounce back on robust buying supportGold, silver bounce back on robust buying support

Both the precious metals staged a strong comeback from their multi-year lows at the domestic bullion market on Saturday as jewellery stockists and investors went on a buying spree following a sharp rally in precious metals worldwide.
The domestic bullion market went into a tailspin and witnessed a near-term breakdown spooked by a massive rout in global commodity arena in the aftermath of the Fed's decision to wind down its historic bond-buying programme.
Though the overall global environment remains complicated against the backdrop of interest rates uncertainty, strong retail jewellery demand for marriages as well as good investment offtake at prevailing levels supported the sharp pullback, a bullion trader said.
Keeping with the general trend, silver also trimmed most of its recent losses and closed above the Rs 36,000 per kg mark on heavy speculative demand.
Standard gold (99.5 purity) recovered by Rs 440 to conclude at Rs 25,950 per 10 grams from Friday's closing level of Rs 25,510.
Pure gold (99.9 purity) also recouped with the same margin to end at Rs 26,100 per 10 grams compared to Rs 25,660.
Silver (.999 fineness) shot up by a hefty Rs 750 to finish at Rs 36,500 per kg against Rs 35,750 on Friday.
On the global front, the yellow metal snapped its seven-session losing streak and recovered sharply as investors covered short positions after the metal hit a 4-1/2 year low following a retreat in the US dollar .
Gold for December delivery climbed to settle at $1,169.80 an ounce on the Comex division of the COMEX late Friday, while silver gained to end at $15.71 an ounce.

BSE  NSE to suspend trading in Kingfisher  UB EngineeringBSE, NSE to suspend trading in Kingfisher, UB Engineering
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 7, 2014  | 22:11 IST
In a major clampdown for non- compliance of Listing Agreement, top exchanges BSE and NSE on Friday announced suspension of trading in shares of Kingfisher Airlines and another group firm, UB Engineering, from next month.
Besides, the entire promoter shareholding of these companies have been frozen with effect from today itself.
The action follows non-compliance to a Listing Agreement clause relating to timely preparation and disclosure of financial results by a listed company for two consecutive quarters. The results are required to be disclosed by listed companies on stock exchange platform for benefit of investors.
In separate circulars, BSE and NSE said that the trading would be suspended in securities of Kingfisher and UB Engineering-both parts of crisis-hit UB group headed by Vijay Mallya -with effect from December 1.
The suspension follows Sebi guidelines with respect to Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for suspension and revocation of trading of shares of listed entities for noncompliance of the Listing Agreement that a listed company needs to follow pursuant to its shares getting listed and traded on a stock exchange.
Shares of Kingfisher, once touted as most luxurious airline in India, are currently trading below Rs 2 apiece and its market capitalisation now stands at just about Rs 150 crore. At one point of time, before financial troubles began and led to its grounding in October 2012, the company carried a market valuation of close to Rs 10,000 crore.
For the year ended March 2013, the carrier saw its net loss widen to Rs 4,301.12 crore. During that period, the gross income stood at Rs 683.46 crore. A consortium of 17 banks has an outstanding debt of about Rs 6,521 crore from the now-grounded carrier and outside the consortium, there are some other loans also.
In Kingfisher, promoters have just 8.54 per cent stake, while public holding stands very high at 91.46 per cent.
The non-promoter shareholders include more than two lakh small investors, over 6,000 HNIs, over 2000 NRIs and 13 FIIs, among others.
Along with Kingfisher and UB Engineering, NSE has also announced trading suspension for securities of Varun Industries Limited on account of non-compliance with Clause 41 of the Listing Agreement for two consecutive quarters, that is quarter ended March, 2014 and June, 2014.
"Accordingly, the entire promoter shareholding of Varun Industries Limited, UB Engineering Limited and Kingfisher Airlines Limited shall be freezed with effect from November 7, 2014 till further notice."
"In case, Varun Industries, UB Engineering and Kingfisher Airlines complies with respective requirement/s including payment of fines on or before November 25, 2014 (five days before the proposed date of suspension), the trading in securities of the said companies will not be suspended," NSE said.
In UB Engineering, which has a market cap of about Rs 14 crore, public holds 59.26 per cent stake while promoter group controls 40.74 per cent.
In case these companies fail to comply with the provisions of the Listing Agreement on or before November 25, 2014, then trading in their shares would be suspended from December 1 and the suspension will continue till such time the company complies including the payment of fine.
After 15 days of suspension, trading in the shares of non-compliant companies would be allowed on Trade for Trade basis in on the first trading day of every week for six months, NSE said.
BSE has taken similar action against 21 companies, including Kingfisher and UB Engineering.
Others include Nilachal Refractories, Linkson International, Secure Earth Technologies, Ratan Glitter Industries, Bheema Cements, Arvind International, Elegant Floriculture & Agrotech India, Pretto Leather Industries, UT Ltd, Arihants Securities Ltd, Raghava Estates and Properties, Tutis Technologies, Valuemart Info Technologies, Ontrack Systems, Avon Corporation, Birla Pacific Medspa, Best & Crompton Engineering, Varun Industries and Maestros Mediline Systems.
Kingfisher Airlines is already facing a close regulatory scrutiny over suspected lapses in its accounting practices and the Corporate Affairs Ministry is looking into possible violations of Companies Act.
The airline, part of the Vijay Mallya-led UB Group, has been grounded for over two years now after being bogged down by huge and mounting losses.
The carrier is yet to submit its annual financial results for the 2013-14 period to the stock exchanges.
In a filing to the BSE on August 26, the carrier had said that steps were being taken to appoint directors in order to comply with provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and listing agreement with the stock exchanges.
"Thereafter, steps will be taken towards publishing the audited results for the year ended March 31, 2014 and for the quarter ended June 30, 2014," it had said.
Back in May, Kingfisher had informed stock exchanges that "there are hardly any employees attending office and the company is currently operating with skeletal staff making it difficult to audit and publish the results in time."
As part of the recovery process, banks in February last year decided to sell a portion of the collateral with them, including shares of its group companies United Spirits Ltd and Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd, Mallya's Goa villa, Kingfisher House in Mumbai and the Kingfisher brand, which was valued at over Rs 4,000 crore at the time it was pledged.

India's stock markets did not do much during the week. The NSE Nifty ended at 8,337, up 15 points from last week's close, while the Sensex rose three points to end the week at 27,869. The Sensex touched an all-time high of 28,010 on November 5; but it ended the day below the 28,000 level.
However, the S&P BSE Midcap index rose 1.68% while the S&P BSE Small Cap index gained 1.70% during the week.
The markets were closed for two days on the occasion of Muharram and Guru Nanak Jayanti.
Experts expect some consolidation in the near term. They say that any movement from here will depend on index for industrial production (IIP) and WPI and CPI numbers to be released next week.  
Vivek Gupta, CMT (Director Research), CapitalVia Global Research, says, "Movement of the index in the near term will depend on IIP, CPI & WPI data expected to be announced later in the week, besides the second-quarter results of big companies."
Rajesh Iyer, head of investment advisory services and family office at Kotak Wealth Management, says, "Economic parameters are still to show any meaningful improvement. Lead indicators are showing a mixed trend. Current account and fiscal deficits are turning more positive and inflation is subsiding fast. However, credit offtake, IIP and investment cycle are still showing weakness."
"Re-rating of equities has already happened as the forward PE has moved up from 13x to 16.5x. From here we expect equity returns to equal earnings growth, which is expected in the range of 15-18%. Equity valuations will remain at elevated levels because of strong inflows from both FIIs and domestic investors. Superior returns given by equities over other asset classes will also lead to a rise in inflows into equities."
Vinod Nair, head, fundamental research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services, says, "We are consolidating at market highs as we have moved very fast from the low of 7,750, led by spurt in FII inflows and quantitative easing in Japan. The market is in a sensitive range and expects the RBI to lower interest rates in the near term. It will anxiously wait for CPI numbers for October which will be released on November 12. The data will decide the momentum going forward."
FIIs poured in Rs 4,411.93 crore during the week. Among sector indices, S&P BSE Realty was the biggest gainer (5.72%). It was followed by S&P BSE Healthcare and S&P BSE Bankex with gains of 3.69% and 1.79% respectively. The biggest loser was S&P BSE Metals (4.34%).
S&P BSE Power was the second-worst performing index (1.49%). Among BSE 100 companies, majority of banks and financial services sector stocks touched their all-time highs.

Stock markets took a breather on Friday with the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex falling about 47 points in volatile trade, retreating from record highs, as investors booked profits in banking, metal and capital goods sector stocks.
After remaining positive in early trade, the 30-share BSE barometer touched the day's high of 27,980.93. However, investors took some profits off the table at near record levels which pushed the BSE index to day's low of 27,739.56.
A round of buying at the fag-end helped to trim losses. The Sensex settled with a loss of 47.25 points, or 0.17 per cent, at 27,868.63.
Among Sensex components, 21 stocks including BHEL , GAIL, Coal India, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Steel and Hindalco fell.
In the previous session on Wednesday, the 30-share Sensex had ended at its all-time closing high of 27,915.88 after touching an intra-day record high of 28,010.39. Continued foreign fund inflows on government's reform push amid hopes of a rate cut by the RBI had fuelled the rally.
Likewise, the 50-issue National Stock Exchange (NSE) index Nifty, which had gained 14.15 points in the previous session, fell 1.30 points (or 0.02 per cent) to close at 8,337.00.
During Friday's session, the gauge dipped below the 8300-mark to touch a low of 8,290.25. It had closed at a closing peak of 8,338.30 after recording a lifetime high of 8,365.55 intra-day on Wednesday.
Banking sector stocks saw a round of selling after remaining outperformers in the recent rally. Major losers were SBI and HDFC Bank.
Bucking the overall trend, shares in healthcare, realty, consumer durables and IT sectors continued their upward march.
Shares of DLF rose over 6 per cent after the Securities Appellate Tribunal allowed the realty giant to redeem mutual funds worth Rs 1,806 crore.
Traders said market was in an over-bought position and participants preferred to lock gains at lifetime highs.

DLF shares rose nearly 6 per cent in early trade after the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) allowed the realty giant to redeem mutual funds to meet working capital needs and service debt payments.
The company had sought permission to redeem money locked in mutual funds after being slapped with market regulator's ban last month that bars it from accessing the capital market for three years.
DLF's scrip jumped 5.64 per cent to Rs 133.80 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Friday. At the National Stock Exchange, shares of the company surged 5.52 per cent to Rs 133.75.
Last month, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had banned DLF and six of its senior-most officials, including founder-Chairman KP Singh, from capital markets for three years.
The company had challenged the ban in SAT on October 22 and sought an interim relief.
The final hearing in DLF's main appeal against the Sebi order would be held on December 10, prior to which Sebi and the company will have to file their replies with SAT.
Stock markets were closed on Thursday on account of Guru Nanak Jayanti.

Jan Dhan needed as banking benefits did not reach poor: PMJan Dhan Yojana needed as banking benefits did not reach poor, says Narendra Modi

Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Photo: Reuters)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said Jan Dhan Yojana was required to correct anomalies created by nationalisation of banks four decades ago as banking benefits did not reach the poor.
"When banks were nationalised about 40 years ago, the government of those days said that these financial institutions were thriving on the money of the wealthy class and had nothing to offer to the poor", he said.
"Four decades have passed since then and when we came to power earlier this year, banks remained as inaccessible to the poor as ever," he said while addressing a meeting of BJP workers in Varanasi.
"It is this anomaly that we have sought to correct through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana . The scheme is enabling the poorest of the poor to have a bank account of his or her own. As a result of this scheme, today the number of bank accounts being opened every week is equal to the number of accounts that were opened in one year previously," he said.
The Prime Minister on August 28 launched the the Jan Dhan scheme to boost financial inclusion. About 7 crore bank accounts have been opened under Jan Dhan scheme so far.
"We had given the option of opening zero balance accounts.
But I must salute the honesty of our people who have deposited a total of Rs 5,000 crore from a share of their hard-earned money in the accounts that have so far been opened under this scheme," Modi said.
Under the scheme, the account holders will get an overdraft facility of Rs 5,000. They would also be provided with a RuPay debit cards and Rs 1 lakh accident insurance cover.
Seeking to underscore his government's pro-poor measures, the Prime Minister also said: "We have laid it down that no pensioner should get less than Rs 1,000 per month as pension.
Earlier, it used to be ridiculously low. Some were getting as little as Rs 50 per month.
"As a result, many people did not even care to visit the post office and collect their pension as their entitlement used to be less than even the auto rickshaw fare."
Subscribers to the retirement fund EPFO will get a minimum of Rs 1,000 under Employees' Pension Scheme 1995 (EPS-95) as the government formally launched the programme in September.

Govt may miss spectrum revenue target of Rs 45 000 crGovt could miss spectrum revenue target of Rs 45,000 crore
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 8, 2014  | 11:41 IST
Trai chairman Rahul Khullar
The government is likely to miss the Budgetary target of Rs 45,000 crore it expects to raise from the February 2015 spectrum auctions and licence fees as the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has said that it would not be able to put on the block 2,100 MHz (3G) and 700 MHz bands.
According to DoT, the defence ministry is not ready to vacate these spectrum bands. The 700 MHz band is the most efficient spectrum, which was earlier earmarked for Prasar Bharti for exclusive spectrum availability to All India Radio, Doordarshan and other communication under the control of the government.
According to a memorandum of understanding between the defence ministry and DoT, the former was to free 65MHz in 1,800 and 2,100 MHz bands for commercial use.
In return, DoT was had to complete the laying of an optical fibre network that is already two years behind schedule. "Discussion is on with defence. TC (Telecom Commission) has decided to focus on spectrum for auction that is coming up for renewal," a DoT official told news agency PTI.
Most of the spectrum which is proposed to be put up for sale is being used by Bharti Airtel , Vodafone India , Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications across various parts of the country.
These companies will need to buy back radio waves to continue operations in areas where their licences will expire in 2015-16. The government has already earmarked a budget target of Rs 45,000 crore against spectrum auction and license fees.
While Rs 18,000 crore will come via license fees and spectrum charges, the government expects Rs 27,000 crore from the next auction. On the other hand, the Commission, the highest decision-making body of DoT, has asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review its recommendations on spectrum valuation and pricing of 1,800 MHz, 900 MHz and 800 MHz and that some of the suggestions cannot be implemented.
Trai last month gave recommendations on valuation and pricing of 1,800 MHz and 900 MHz bands, used for 2G services, for the auctions. The regulator had suggested about 10-per cent higher price for spectrum in 1,800 Mhz over the final bid price that was received in the February auctions.
The government had earlier expected auction of 3G spectrum to fetch, at least, Rs 50,000 crore for 15 MHz, as per the 2010 auction price, of which Rs 17,000 crore could come during this fiscal.
The government had earlier expected to garner Rs 10,000 crore from sale of airwaves in the 1,800 MHz, 900 MHz and 800 MHz bands assuming that winners pay only 30 per cent of the bid amount up front.

Bad loans of PSU banks set to become worseNPAs of public sector banks set to become worse
Mail Today Bureau     Mumbai/ New Delhi   Last Updated: November 8, 2014  | 10:17 IST
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan
Bad loans, or non-performing assets (NPAS), of public sector banks increased during the second quarter (July-September) of this fiscal and are expected to continue into the next financial year as well.
Of the 34 banks that reported earnings for Q2, 25 mainly in the public sector reported a rise in bad loans as measured by gross NPAs as a percentage of total loans, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.
The Supreme Court ruling scrapping allocation of 214 coal blocks to companies in power, steel and cement sectors is also expected to fuel bad loans.
Apart from power, metals, mining, highways and textiles have been major stress areas for banks. India Ratings and Research, a unit of credit rating agency Fitch, expects banks to restructure loans worth between Rs 60,000 crore and Rs 1 lakh crore in the next five months with the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) new rules ending the difference between restructured loans and NPAs coming into effect from April FY15.
Consequently, these banks may have to make higher provisions in their books against bad loans, which could further erode their profits. Banks will also need more funds to act as a buffer against the losses from bad loans.
Lenders are already estimated by analysts to need as much as $110 billion in new capital through March 2019 to comply with new global regulations spelt out in the Basel III norms.
Bank of Baroda, which is the largest public sector bank after State Bank of India , on Friday announced 3.32-per cent increase in NPAs for the second quarter up from 3.15 per cent in the year-ago period.
The bank also saw fresh slippages to the tune of Rs 1,758 crore, which spells more trouble ahead. "The stress in the sector may continue for, at least, one or two quarters," said P. Srinivas, an executive director at BoB .
He expects addition to bad loans to be at current levels. Srinivas added that the bank has sought Rs 500-crore capital infusion from the government this year.
Punjab National Bank also reported an increase in its NPAs to 5.65 per cent of the total loans from 5.14 per cent in the corresponding period a year before.
Leading private sector bank ICICI Bank , which also has exposure to the infrastructure sector, has also reported increase in NPAs to 3.12 per cent of total credit in Q2 of 2014-15 compared 3.05 per cent in the same quarter of the previous fiscal.
The country's top lender SBI will announce its financial results next week. The banking sector is sitting on roughly Rs6 lakh crore worth of stressed loans, which works out to nearly 10 per cent of the total advances, according India Ratings and Research.

Brands pose challenge for small firms: Ram Vilas PaswanManu Kaushik      Follow @manukaushik    Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 12:24 IST
Winners of second edition of Business Today's Emerging Companies Excellence awards
The second edition of Business Today's Emerging Companies Excellence awards celebrated the achievements of some of the hidden gems of corporate India.
The event, held in New Delhi's ITC Maurya hotel on November 7, saw a huge gathering of people from the business world. The event started with Business Today Editor Prosenjit Datta explaining the audience the rigorous process that BT followed in choosing the winners for this year.
The chief guest of the evening Ram Vilas Paswan , Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution highlighted the importance of emerging companies for the Indian economy. He said emerging companies - companies with turnover of less than Rs 1,500 crore - are the backbone of the economy. " Small and medium enterprises are thousands in numbers. They give employment to over one crore people in this country."
Citing his own example, the minister said that, when he was young, he never used to pay heed to brands. "We would usually buy products which were sold at low prices. Today, the situation is different. Many people go after brands. This presents a big challenge for small enterprises," he said.
Highlighting the need to improve the image of Indian products globally, Paswan said that emerging companies have to deal with the challenges and still have to compete, not just in India but also in the international markets.
"Our image is terrible. We make the best products but we are not able to market it properly due to perception issues. China and we were at the same level. But their marketing and product finishing are excellent. They are good at finding out the right markets where they can sell products," the minister said.
Paswan said there's a huge difference in the way private and public sectors operate. "I have seen the difference between public and private sectors closely. In the public sector, people work for eight hours and their job is done. On the other hand, private sector entrepreneurs like you work for even 20 hours."
In its endeavour to find out hidden treasures in corporate India, Business Today was supported by knowledge partner YES Bank and procedure reviewer PwC India.

10% GDP growth certainly achievable: ParekhExceptionally good conditions in place for 10 per cent growth, says Deepak Parekh
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 8, 2014  | 12:45 IST

Bullish over robust fundamentals and improving macroeconomic conditions, industry leader Deepak Parekh on Monday said India currently has "exceptionally good conditions" in place to aspire for 10 per cent economic growth but much needs to be done to achieve that target.
While stating that a 10 per cent GDP growth was certainly achievable, Parekh, however, said he would not "hazard a guess" on the time frame for achieving a double-digit growth.
"I try and think back and I can't recall any other instance than now when India had rising stock markets, falling oil prices and a stable, majority government all at the same time.
"These are exceptionally good conditions to once again lay the foundation for the much-aspired 10% GDP growth for India," he said while speaking at the ISB Capital Markets Conclave in Mumbai.
Parekh, known for his candid views on issues related to Indian economy and markets, said it is "suffice to say that a 10 per cent GDP growth will not happen without extensive judicial, electoral, police, labour and land reforms, along with financial sector reforms."
"At this juncture, much needs to be done to even attain a 6.5-7 per cent GDP growth rate.
"But yes, the picture had changed dramatically for India," he said, while listing out three fundamental changes including improved confidence with the government being perceived as being able to deliver on growth and what is driving the present euphoria.
On the other two changes, he said: "India has a Prime Minister who leads from the front and key macro fundamentals are working in India's favour".
For the current fiscal, Parekh said the estimated GDP growth rate was 5.5-5.9 per cent, while adding that India has been performing significantly better than many other emerging markets.
He said the research analysts are already describing India as being on the top among the BRICs and the "best house" in a bad neighbourhood.
"And to borrow the latest buzz phrase from Bill Gross, India is considered the 'cleanest dirty shirt' amongst emerging markets," he said, while adding that India has become the toast of the FII party as it is perceived as 'less of a mess' in comparison.
Parekh said that FIIs have invested $37 billion so far this year, including around $14 billion in equities and debt inflows of $23 billion.
"And while another new high of 28,000 has been touched, brokerage houses have long since sent the Sensex forecast sky high," he added.

Insurance bill will be passed in Winter Session: JaitleyInsurance bill will be passed in Winter Session, says Jaitley

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday expressed the confidence that Insurance Amendment Bill, which seeks to raise the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, will be passed in the forthcoming Winter Session of Parliament.
"I hope to get a positive report from the select committee. Insurance bill may be passed (in the coming session of Parliament)," he said at a book release function in which he was pitted against former Finance Minister P Chidambaram at a book release function.
The debate, during launch of the book '2014: The election that changed India' written by Consulting Editor of India Today Group Rajdeep Sardesai, was moderated by Karan Thapar, senior journalist of India Today.
"Like all good things, this (Insurance Amendment Bill) will come to an end. I am hoping for a positive select Committee report. And I do hope to pass it this month," Jaitley said.
The Winter Session of Parliament, during which the insurance bill is likely to be taken up for discussion and passage, will begin on November 24.
On why the Congress party was opposing its own insurance bill, Chidambaram said, "Perhaps the Congress party is doing tit for tat. It might not be the politically correct thing to do, but if they hung it up to dry for one year, may be some in the Congress party thought let them hang out to dry for four months."
Recalling his meetings with BJP leader Sushma Swaraj and other leaders in December 2013, Chidambaram said, "I implored them ,they said no. Finally they said BJP has no appetite to pass any Bills any more."
The Former Finance Minister said that he would cheer from outside if the Bill was passed in the Winter Session.
The insurance bill is currently with the Select Committee of Parliament which is expected to give its report in third week of November.
Chidambaram said he felt let down when Jaitley did not repeal the retrospective tax amendment of 2012 despite the clear majority in Parliament. The Former Finance Minister said he could not do because of the lack of it.
Jaitley replied saying that he had given clear assurance that there would be no retrospective amendment in future and no notices would be issued.
He said the government could not do it because there was a pending dispute, an apparent reference to arbitration with Vodafone , and felt any amendment would be misconstrued by people as sacrificing government interest.
Referring to the Congress defeat in elections, Chidambaram said after ten years in power anti-incumbency stares in one's face and admitted that some mistakes were made.
But, he added, the economy was a major factor and if the government had been able to turn it around, then the results could have been different. "But still BJP would have been number one."
The CAG report on 2G and other issues, Chidambaram said, "clearly hurt the Congress party. I think 2G could have been handled differently in the sense that the Prime Minister could have put his foot down and said I am sorry, I will not let you go forward with the first come first serve (FCFS) route.
"Or after licences had been granted and issue was brought up, he could have said cancel licences without waiting for the judgement. It hurt us. My personal view was once this came out as a scandal of bandwidth allotment, the Government should have cancelled all the licences without waiting for the Supreme Court (judgement)."
On why the then government did not cancel the licences, Chidambaram said the decision was taken to wait for the court verdict. "The decision was taken to wait for the Court verdict. These are the matters which do not come to the Cabinet. These are ideas which are discussed informally.
"I think the idea as suggested and considered.I always believed it was a pretty simple decision rather than suffer any judgement and then try to work out consequent."

Nissan is recalling more than 52,000 vehicles for passenger air bags that can explode with too much force and send shards of metal into the passenger compartment.
The vehicles have air bag systems made by troubled Japanese supplier Takata Corp. Nissan recalls are among nearly 8 million from 10 automakers over the Takata air bags.
The recall announced on Saturday affects the Infiniti FX35 and FX45 from 2003 to 2005, Infiniti I35 from 2003 and 2004 and Infiniti M35 and M45 from 2006. Also affected are Nissan Pathfinders from 2003 and 2004 and Nissan Sentras from 2004 to 2006.
The vehicles were sold or registered in 12 high-humidity state and territories.
Tokyo-based Nissan says it will notify owners and replace the air bag inflator for free.

JP Morgan plans to cut 3 000 more jobs this yearJP Morgan plans to cut 3,000 more jobs this year

New York, Nov 8:  
JP Morgan, the nation’s largest bank by assets, plans to cut 3,000 more jobs this year than previously planned in its card and mortgage business units.
The bank said in February that it was planning to eliminate about 2,000 jobs this year in its card, merchant services and auto unit, but now says that it will have to cut a total of 4,000 jobs in the unit by the end of 2014.
JP Morgan will also eliminate more jobs in its mortgage unit, reducing up to 7,000 positions in that part of the bank, compared with an earlier target of 6,000.
The New York bank employs about 251,000 employees worldwide, according to FactSet.
The figures were disclosed in a presentation made yesterday by Gordon Smith, CEO of Chase Consumer & Community Banking. He was speaking at the BancAnalysts’ Association of Boston Conference in Boston.
JPMorgan Chase and Co, which reported net income of $5.6 billion in the third quarter, is seeking to cut expenses at its consumer banking unit by $2 billion between 2014 and 2016, according to the presentation.
The bank is also trying to cut costs through greater use of technology.
For example, by encouraging more customers to use electronic statements instead of paper ones, the bank estimates that it can save about $100 million in paper and mailing costs by 2016. Smith estimates that the cost of a mailing statement is about 50 cents, compared to a cost of less than 1 cent for one that is sent electronically.

Rolls-Royce launches Ghost Series II at Rs 4.50 crautomobile
British ultra-luxury car maker Rolls-Royce on Friday rolled out its latest offering Ghost Series II in the domestic market, priced at Rs 4.50 crore and pitched for lower taxes to spur growth in the ultra luxury car segment in the country.
“India is a key market for Rolls-Royce cars. In answer to our clients’ demand for the best in effortless, dynamism, modern luxury and industry leading technology, we are proud to present Ghost II series,” Rolls-Royce Asia-Pacific general manager Sven J Ritter said at the launch.
He said in their latest offering, customers will find the same level of exclusivity, quality and perfection that is quintessentially Rolls-Royce.
He said that India is among the top five markets for Ghost model in the Asia Pacific region but did not divulge any sales number.
The British ultra-luxury car maker, which entered the Indian market in 2005, currently sells three models — Phantom, Ghost and Wraith, through five dealerships across the country.
Ghost was first launched in India in 2009.
However, he said that Rolls-Royce has so far sold 250 units of its three models since 2005.
Building on this success, is Ghost II series which comes with innovative technological design and engineering features, he said.
“We certainly see more growth. Sentiment are positive following the new Government taking over but one thing that could change is the tax system. Taxes are very high. Though there are several other issues which are to be addressed by the new government, we will certainly welcome lower taxes for the luxury segment,” he said.

P Chidambaram vs Arun Jaitley: On tough decisions and moreNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
When Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and his predecessor P Chidambaram shared the stage on Friday, both veterans debated several issues — economic policy, the NDA government’s performance and the political tactics of the two parties. Excerpts from the debate at the launch of Consulting Editor, The India Today Group, Rajdeep Sardesai’s book ‘2014: The Election That Changed India’.
On retrospective taxation
Chidambaram: You have won 282 seats … and this was the time to take hard decisions. With 282, I would have reversed the retrospective tax with a simple amendment. I was firmly hoping that Arun would reverse it … I wish you will do it in 2015 (Budget).
Jaitley: You knew that you were going out of power. I expected Chidambaram would clean up the mess. It was a defining moment and it gave Indian economy a bad name …We did not do a legislation because public could find it difficult to understand why there is a legislation while a case is pending in the court.
On reforms
Chidambaram: I feel let down. (For the BJP government not taking tough reform initiatives despite having a majority).
Jaitley: Nobody feels let down. It’s very easy to comment that we should do the most difficult reforms in the beginning. But those (that) need larger consensus in the country are difficult to pursue in the beginning. You will have to survive to implement. The reforms that can create confrontation can be taken up later
On Insurance Bill
Chidambaram: (On why the Congress had opposed its own Bill) Perhaps the Congress party is doing tit for tat. What happened in 2013 December (when the BJP decided to oppose it despite assurances on its backing) must be haunting them. It might not be the politically correct thing to do, but if they hung it up to dry for one year, may be some in the Congress party thought let them hang out to dry for four.
Jaitley: I hope to get a positive report from the Select Committee … Insurance Bill may be passed (in the Winter Session of Parliament). …Like all good things, this (Insurance Amendment Bill) will come to an end. I am hoping for a positive Select Committee report. And I do hope to pass it this month.
On Nehruvian consensus
Chidambaram: They (the BJP) will try as hard as they might. But I doubt if they can break the consensus evolved in Nehru time. They truly can’t do divisive agenda or Hindutva or Right wing … it cannot dissolve Nehruvian consensus.
Jaitley: We have to evolve a new policy with emphasis on security issues, economic issues etc which may be alien to the era in which Panditji evolved his views. Our agenda is to evolve new polices … which are different from those existing in the era of Jawaharlal Nehru.

Uddhav: Shiv Sena to sit in opposition if BJP accepts NCP supportUpdated: November 10, 2014 08:08 IST
Sena to sit in Opposition if BJP takes NCP support

TOPICS
state politics
"Is the BJP ready to accept support from NCP, which supported the likes of Ishrat Jahan?"
Hours after the Union Council of Ministers was expanded on Sunday, a slighted Shiv Sena, which has been refused a Cabinet berth, declared it would sit in the opposition if the newly elected Bharatiya Janata Party-led minority government in Maharashtra sought the support of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to survive the trust vote on Wednesday.
The Sena will vote against the new government in the State if the BJP accepted support from the NCP, an anti-Hindutva party, party chief Uddav Thackeray told presspersons after a long huddle with Sena MLAs.
“How can you take support from [NCP chief] Sharad Pawar, who was the first to use words such as saffron terrorism? Is the BJP ready to accept support from the NCP, which supported the likes of Ishrat Jahan? If the BJP is ready to accept support from the NCP,” Mr. Thackeray said, “the Sena will sit in the opposition and vote against the BJP government in Maharashtra for the sake of Hindutva.”
However, he refused to say if the Sena would withdraw Anant Geete from the one slot that the Sena has in the Union Cabinet, continuing to keep the doors open for a rapprochement with the BJP.
“I will decide at the right time,” was all he said.
Last week, Mr. Pawar declared that if need be, his party would vote for the trust motion to be moved by the State’s first ever BJP Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis.
The announcement by Mr. Pawar, whose party has 41 MLAs, has weakened the bargaining power of the Sena, which has 63.

Shiv Sena to sit in opposition if BJP takes NCP s support: UddhavLetters to  the editor
Shiv Sena today threatened to sit in opposition in Maharashtra if ruling BJP dared to take support of Sharad Pawar’s NCP for the survival of its government but also kept the door open for reconciliation, saying it should come clear on the issue within two days.
“Shiv Sena won’t hanker for power at the cost of self- respect,” Sena President Uddhav Thackeray told reporters at Sena Bhawan in Central Mumbai tonight, after a meeting of party legislators.
“Had we been hungry for power, we would have accepted whatever came our way in today’s (Union ministry) expansion,” he said.
“If we don’t get a satisfactory answer (from BJP) in next two days, we will sit in opposition,” Uddhav said.
“We feel Hindutva forces should not split. But Sharad Pawar has announced support to BJP. NCP leaders were the ones to visit the house of Ishrat Jahan (one of the victims of alleged 2004 fake encounter in Gujarat),” he said.
“It will be the misfortune of the state and country if BJP accepts NCP support,” he said.
“Hindutva powers should be united and if BJP wants to go with NCP, then our paths will be different,” Uddhav said.
“NCP Chief Sharad Pawar was the one who coined the term “saffron terror”. If BJP accepts his party’s support, we will prefer to sit in opposition and be with the people,” he said.
Asked about Sena MP Anil Desai going to Delhi today but returning here without being sworn in, Uddhav said, “We had told them (BJP) that there cannot be two yardsticks, one for the Centre and other for state.”
“In the Centre you are taking us with you, but there was no clarity about our role in the state,” he said.
To a query on a reported meeting of Sena and NCP leaders recently, Uddhav said, “If I have to meet (NCP leaders) I will do so openly.”
On former Sena leader Suresh Prabhu, who was inducted in the central ministry today, Uddhav said when Atal Bihari Vajpayee government first came to power, Bal Thackeray had named Prabhu as the party’s first choice for ministerial post.
“Pawar had toppled the Vajpayee government and today it is Pawar whose company BJP wants,” Uddhav said.
The newly installed Devendra Fadnavis government is slated to prove its majority on floor of House in a special session beginning tomorrow.
BJP has 121 MLAs and needs support of 24 MLAs more to reach simple majority in the 288-member House.
“Forces which are dangerous for Hindus have raised their heads in recent Assembly polls,” Uddhav said, in an apparent reference to Hyderabad-based the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM), which won two seats in recently held Maharashtra Assembly polls.
“At such a time, if BJP wants to go with Pawar who spoke of saffron terror, we will sit in opposition,” he said, adding, “I am free to take my party’s decision. I expect a response from BJP.”
“We won’t be uninvited guests,” the Sena Chief said when asked why was his party not pressing its case to be a part of the BJP government in Maharashtra.
Sena legislator from adjoining Thane, Eknath Shinde was this evening elected the party’s group leader in the Assembly.

"I offer you to form a commission under Supreme Court to investigate 2013 elections...If the commission accepts fraud in elections, you [Nawaz] will have to resign and hold fresh elections," said Imran.
Pakistan opposition leader Imran Khan on Sunday asked Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to appoint a commission under the Supreme Court to probe allegations of rigging in the last year’s general election.
Addressing a huge rally of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party supporters in Rahimyar Khan city in Punjab, he said that Sharif should resign if fraud in the election was proved.
It was a major concession by cricketer-turned-politician as previously he had always demanded Sharif’s resignation ahead of the probe, charging that Sharif, being in a position of power, will try to influence the investigation.
“I offer you to form a commission under Supreme Court to investigate 2013 elections...If the commission accepts fraud in elections, you [Nawaz] will have to resign and hold fresh elections,” said Imran.
He said the commission should also include officials from army’s Military Intelligence and Inter-Services Intelligence agency.
He also demanded that the probe should complete its work within four to six weeks.
Imran has been protesting in front of the parliament since August, demanding Sharif’s resignation, whom he accuses of rigging the last year’s general elections.
Sharif promised probe into the rigging allegations, but has refused to resign.
The government has so far not responded to the new proposal by Imran to end the political impasse, which the government alleges, has caused a massive loss to the national exchequer.
In August, Sharif has requested the Supreme Court to set up a three—member judicial commission to probe allegations of rigging in polls. The apex court, till date, has not taken any action.
Pressure is mounting on Imran to call off the protests.
But he is adamant and has asked workers to prepare for massive protest in the capital on November 30, if the stalemate continues.

Silence is the thing, amid the din

The noise and confusion that reigns in the world around us.

A French black-and-white silent movie, The Artist, won top honours at the Academy Awards in 2012. It had to happen. There is so much eloquence in silence. Remember the Charlie Chaplin genre of films? Are they coming back? I am no movie buff. But violence and noise are things humankind should shun. And silence being golden is a good break, and we are in dire need of it. The cacophony all around is killing.
We watch on television the noise and confusion that reigns in the world around us. Everybody has something to say but nobody wants to listen. There is zero tolerance.
We watch programmes on TV where the anchor and a panel of experts discuss and analyse issues. They begin nicely enough, but when the debate gets heated, sparks fly and everyone begins to talk simultaneously. Even the anchor has a problem controlling them. The one with most lung power out-speaks others. We are left numb.
Thank god we have the option of switching off the TV to get instant relief. Today’s music is also all noise. Where are the lyrics and the soft and soothing voices? Thank god for classical music — we still can listen to them and derive soul satisfaction.
I admire the silence of the West. Their neighbourhoods are so quiet. One can drink deep of such silence, especially when one is on a walk absorbing a lot of things. I love my India alright, but our strong point is not silence. We may well be one of the noisiest countries on the planet. In the bus, or in queues, in movies theatres, restaurants or even when they go for walks, people talk so loudly that they will wake up entire neighbourhoods — especially early in the morning. Now with dogs abounding on every street, if one dog starts barking, others follow it up with a chorus.
Even children don’t lag behind. I remember watching kids at play in a neighbourhood, abroad. There, like the adults the kids hardly ever scream or shout. Only Indian children scream their throats out.
This happened when I was once holidaying in the U.S. in Silicon Valley. A Japanese lady complained to the office of an apartment complex about an Indian family. The parents were off to work, and the grandparents had come for a holiday and they were teaching the kids slokas. Everytime the kids recited back what had been taught, the grandparents and the kids clapped with all their might, creating a ruckus.
The Japanese lady said: “That is the time my baby is fast asleep and my neighbours are yelling their heads off. The baby is startled into waking up and I am unable to finish my house work.” Being in the adjoining building, I too had heard the kids reciting the slokas and thought it to be laudable. The grandparents, I thought, were spending quality time with them, but they could have kept the decibel level low.
Once upon a time fire-crackers were lighted only during Deepavali. Now they are set off on birthdays, weddings, elections and what have you. Accompanying them on such occasions is loud film music. The world, as Wordsworth wrote, ‘is too much with us’. We are drowning in a welter of noise and other negative factors like road rage, violence, fisticuffs and streetfights. We see so much pent-up anger in people on a number of issues waiting to explode. The word ‘kolaveri’ said it all.
Remember the ‘Tower of Babel’ where people were shouting themselves hoarse in a diversity of tongues and nobody wanted to hear the other? We thought it was mythical, but no, it was real enough. All the chaos is back, it seems. As they say there is nothing new under the sun and history has a way of repeating itself. Things have to come full circle.

New Delhi, November 7:  
Come Sunday, and American fast food chain Burger King will throw open the doors of its first restaurant in India.
According to Burger King India’s Facebook page, the company will open its first restaurant at Select Citywalk Mall in South Delhi on November 9.
Buzz in social media
The announcement has created a buzz in social media networks even before the launch, as Burger King India’s pre-launch campaign introduces Indian consumers to the concept of the “Whopper” and giving a sneak-peek into its menu through its Twitter handle and Facebook page. Burger King India’s Facebook page has already garnered over a lakh fans.
Keeping in mind the Indian palate, the fast-food chain has tweaked its menu to include vegetarian options such as Spicy Bean Royale, Paneer King Melt and Veg Chilli Cheese Melt.
Famous for its beef burgers, Burger King India will be offering mutton whoppers besides chicken burgers. The burger chain earlier hit news when it decided to give a limited time offer to consumers in Delhi to pre-order their burgers by buying whopper-vouchers on e-commerce site eBay India at promotional prices and grab Burger King merchandise that can be redeemed on Sunday.
Rival brands
In a statement earlier this week, Uma Talreja, Chief Marketing Officer, Burger King India, said: “Given that our guests are passionately expressing their love for the whopper online, it made sense to put it online for them to get a sneak peek into what is coming soon.”
Burger King India is entering India at a time when brands such as Fatburger and Johnny Rockets have already forayed into India, while McDonalds and others already have a presence in metros and tier-2 towns.
According to a report by Technopak –Indian Food Trends 2014, “The food service industry has registered swift growth in the past decade, with boóth international and homegrown chains booming.
“It is projected to grow further, at a double-digit rate, over the next five years.”

No dialogue with Pakistan if ceasefire violation continues: Arun JaitleyPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 9, 2014 1:22 pm | Updated: November 9, 2014 1:29 pm
In a stern warning to Pakistan, India on Sunday said there cannot be a dialogue with Islamabad if ceasefire violations are repeated.
“…if repeated ceasefire violations take place then environment for dialogue itself suffers,” Defence Minister Arun Jaitley, who is also holding the portfolio of the Finance Ministry, said at the India Global Forum meeting.
“Yes, there should be a dialogue. We will welcome it but then the environment for dialogue has to be created by both countries. One of them cannot upset the environment and then say why dialogue is not taking place,” Jaitley said.
The dialogue process was derailed after Pakistan envoy met Kashmiri separatists just a day before the foreign secretary level talks in August.
“When we further the discussions (after swearing-in invitation) it was through foreign secretary dialogue, this was responded to by an immediate invite to the separatists particularly keeping in mind elections in J&K at the doorsteps. Now this we found completely unacceptable…,” he said.
Noting that there are issues in Kashmir , Jaitley said that the valley has been by and large peaceful. “We are expecting a peaceful elections in the valley notwithstanding efforts to disturb the environment.”
He also praised the armed forces for showing exemplary courage in rescue and relief operations during the recent floods in the state.
With regard to the border issue in the eastern region, Jaitley said India is keen for expediting the process to resolve the matter.
“As far as China is concerned, our economic relationship continues to grow, there are a lot of mutual investments in both countries and there are huge trade between two countries,” he said.
“But then we have a pending issue of settlement of boundary itself and the commission appointed in 2003 for that purpose; we do hope it functions now expeditiously. We (will) continue to have a meaningful dialogue with them,” he added.

BJP to move no-confidence motion against TMC governmentBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: November 8, 2014 8:30 pm
Alleging that the Trinamool Congress was running a ‘jungle raj’ in West Bengal, state BJP president Rahul Sinha on Saturday said that the party would move a no-confidence motion on the floor of the Assembly.
“I have told my party leader and our only MLA in the state Assembly Shamik Bhattacharya to move a no-confidence motion against the misrule and jungle raj of the TMC government,” Sinha said.
Asked how the BJP would proceed to muster the numbers required to move a no-trust motion when it has only one MLA in the 294-member House, Sinha said, “The previous Speaker used to give importance to the party whose members are few in the
Assembly. Though it is not a hard and fast rule, we hope the present Speaker will follow his example.”
He also gave no specific reply when asked if his party was in talks with other MLAs in this regard.
Sinha also slammed the land policy of the state government and said that statements by the Chief Minister were creating confusion in the industrial community.
“It is strange that even after being in power for three years the state government does not have any clear land policy. Earlier, the government asked industrialists to search for their own land because the state will not interfere. Now they are saying that the state will give land from their land bank,” Sinha pointed out.

India agrees to stay on as advisory board member of UNCCTPrint
By: Press Trust of India | United Nations | Posted: November 8, 2014 10:29 am
India has agreed to UN chief Ban Ki-moon’s offer to remain a member of the advisory board of a UN centre on counter-terrorism for an additional three years.
“We would like to express our consent to the offer of the Secretary-General to India to continue as a member of the Advisory Board of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Center (UNCCT) for an additional three years starting from April 2, 2015,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Asoke Mukerji said in his statement to the 9th meeting of the board.
“We would continue to share with this important center of counter-terrorism our experience in fighting the menace of terrorism,” he said.
Mukerji said India agrees with the assessment that the new contribution of USD 100 million would inject new dynamism into the work of UNCCT.
He, however, said that the finances are only one aspect of the initiative.
“Proper implementation and close monitoring of the projects holds the key,” he said while cautioning that the USD 6.8 million earmarked for projects till December 2015 should be judiciously used.
Mukerji also supported the idea of building UNCCT into a center of excellence.
“We need to expand the capacity of the center, and in this regard we would like to suggest that UNCCT may now look at having an independent infrastructure, character and workforce,” he said.
The UNCCT was established in 2011 within the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) to assist in meeting capacity-building needs of member states, and to strengthen United Nations’ counter-terrorism expertise.
The Centre engages with the over 30 CTITF entities with expertise on a broad spectrum of counter-terrorism related issues.
The centre’s advisory board is chaired by Saudi Arabia and has 22 members including China, Russia, Pakistan, UK and the US.
The board provides guidance to the UNCCT Executive Director on the Centre’s annual plan and programme of work including annual budget, programmes, projects and proposals.

Why Gowda was gently shuntedoutPrint
“Nice man” Gowda not being able to assert himself
Written by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:34 am | Updated: November 10, 2014 8:35 am
Over a month ago, Railway Minister Sadananda Gowda selected an Indian Railway Personnel Service officer to head the crucial ‘Confidential’ branch of the Railway Board. Despite a written order, however, the rail bureaucracy did not move, and the post remains vacant.
The months in office of the first Railway Minister of the Narendra Modi government is replete with instances of the ever-smiling, “nice man” Gowda not being able to assert himself. Several Railway officials said this could never have been said about Gowda’s predecessors Lalu Prasad or Mamata Banerjee.
The Railways are big in Modi’s scheme of things. The PM has given the Railways a list of 30-odd tasks needed to be performed for an overall turnaround. The PMO monitors progress monthly. A majority of these have made no tangible progress.
At the meeting on connectivity-related infrastructure targets convened by the PM last week, the Railways got a tongue-lashing as things did not seem to have moved as desired, sources said.
Gowda did, in fact, try. He called meetings of the entire Railway Board to review PM-monitored projects regularly. One of these meetings took place on a national holiday last week. He also invoked the Swachh Bharat campaign wherever he could.
But things did not move. Devoid of any big idea to lead the ministry that has the biggest people connect, Gowda was increasingly being seen as someone out of his depth, unable to get work done.
Suresh Prabhu, a man with a big reformist reputation and enjoying Modi’s trust, is expected to be a tactful leader who will be able to galvanise the Railways bureaucracy, be more in sync with the deliverables and outside-the-box ideas the PMO is interested in, and overall be a more impressive “brand ambassador” for the Railways.
Prabhu was quick off the blocks on Sunday: tweeting, within minutes of the portfolios being announced, “Railways could be the engine of growth if driven properly. Now in the drivers seat”, and “All those who work for the Railways must work towards realising Honourable PM’s dream”.
By contrast, Gowda’s official handle continued to describe him as “Minister for Railways”, his last tweet having been on November 8, wishing L K Advani a happy birthday.
Gowda failed to find a way to untangle the knot of big infra projects like the locomotive factories in Madhepura and Marhaura, to bring out a roadmap for FDI in Railways, and to show progress in apparently simpler tasks like making Wifi available on trains and stations — something the PMO has been wanting since June.
Officials said the former Karnataka chief minister was also overwhelmed by the complex ways of the Rail Bhavan bureaucracy. For the past four months, the ministry’s proposal to fill posts of seven general managers across India has been getting rejected by the PM-led Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, which has been finding faults with the file. The ACC has recently given scathing remarks on the way the Railways has continued…

The rise of Prabhu: PMs sherpa with Cabinet rank to sherpa inCabinetPrint
Suresh Prabhu.
Written by P Vaidyanathan Iyer | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:24 am | Updated: November 10, 2014 4:07 pm
Three days ago, in his first media interaction as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s sherpa for the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Brisbane on November 15-16, Suresh Prabhu said in a lighter vein that the question of him joining the Council of Ministers could be included in the G20 agenda if the media so desired. Prabhu, 61, a chartered accountant, said this with a wry smile, masking whatever information he had of the weekend’s Cabinet expansion.
Prabhu, who has got Railways, is not just another addition to Modi’s Council of Ministers. Given his intellectual bandwidth, a non-political persona, and the trust reposed by the Prime Minister, he brings more than his weight in the government.
Having decided to severe ties with the Shiv Sena, Modi could not have got the Sena to part with a Rajya Sabha seat for Prabhu. The Prime Minister also felt that attaching ministerial strings would rob Prabhu of his flexibility to advise him on a variety of critical issues, from energy and climate change to physical infrastructure and the economy.
Finally though, Modi decided to add depth and weight to his team by roping in Prabhu and Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar. Prabhu, who had once said in an interview that he would rather quit politics than change parties, was convinced by Modi to join the BJP. After 18 years with the Sena, he formally joined the BJP on Sunday, ahead of the swearing-in ceremony.
A person close to Prabhu said Modi trusted him and the former banker — Prabhu was chairman of Saraswat Bank, one of the largest cooperative banks in Maharashtra — would be his sounding board on complex issues related to energy, infrastructure and climate change.
The Modi government had earlier appointed him as the head of an advisory group for integrated development of power, coal and renewable energy. Subsequently, Prabhu was made the sherpa to brief and assist the PM on India’s stand on global issues at the G20 summit, and given Cabinet rank. He was also tipped to head the “think-tank plus” — the Planning Commission in its new avatar.
Prabhu has been close to Modi since the days when the latter was the Gujarat Chief Minister. In fact, after the Wharton India Economic Forum, a student-run India-centric conference hosted by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, withdrew its invitation to Modi as a keynote speaker in 2013, Prabhu cancelled his speaking programme as a mark of protest. That showed his proximity to Modi.
Prabhu’s biggest strength, as also his drawback in a party like Shiv Sena, was his clean image and unwillingness to shed his integrity at the altar of politics. In August 2002, Sena chief Bal Thackeray pulled him out of then Prime Minister A B Vajpayee’s Cabinet without stating any reasons. Prabhu was then the Union Power Minister.
Prabhu won the Lok Sabha elections thrice since 1996, but lost in 2009.

Amazon launches a speaker you can talk to like Apple iPhone s SiriEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Do you want to talk to your speaker? Amazon.com Inc has launched “Amazon Echo”, a speaker you leave on all day and give it voice directions, like Siri on an Apple Inc iPhone.
As well as taking commands such as “play music by Bruno Mars” or “add gelato to my shopping list”, Amazon said the device accesses the internet to answer questions such as “when is Thanksgiving?” and “what is the weather forecast?”
Amazon said the speaker, which runs on Amazon Web Services, continually learns a user’s speech patterns and preferences.
Users start the speaker up saying the wake up word, “Alexa”.
They can then feed Amazon Echo commands or questions or, if they want, wirelessly stream music web services such as Spotify, iTunes and Pandora via their mobiles.
Amazon Echo is priced at $199, or $99 for members for the online retail giant’s Amazon Prime loyalty scheme. It is available on an invitation-only basis in coming weeks.
Amazon has had an unusually busy year, developing a mobile phone, video productions and grocery deliveries.
Last month, the company forecast sales for the crucial holiday quarter that disappointed Wall Street and investors who are eager to see Amazon curtail its ambitions and start delivering sustainable profits.

Jaitley hopeful of passage of Insurance Bill in Winter sessionJaitley hopeful of passage of Insurance Bill in Winter session

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley (file photo)
New Delhi, Nov 9:  
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today expressed hope that the long-pending Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, which seeks to raise the FDI cap in the sector to 49 per cent, will get Parliament approval in the upcoming Winter Session.
“We have opened up investments in various sectors. I do hope this (Winter) session I will be able to pass the Insurance Bill,” he said at the India Global Forum meeting here.
The month-long Winter Session of Parliament is scheduled to commence from November 24.
FDI in the sector is capped at 26 per cent at present.
The much-delayed Insurance Bill has been referred to the Select Committee of Parliament. The Bill, which comes with a rider that the management control would rest in the hands of Indian promoter, has been pending since 2008 in the Rajya Sabha.
The Minister said India is pursuing the policy of allowing foreign investment with sectoral cap keeping in mind the requirements of the economy and the appetite of the Indian political system.
“When we were in the government last time we opened up the sector. At that time, the political system had an appetite for a limited opening. We are now opening up the sector a little more,” he added.
Bowing to opposition pressure, the government had in August agreed to refer the Insurance Bill to the 15—member Select Committee. The committee is expected to submit its report by the third week of November.
The reform, according to experts, could increase the flow of foreign investment to the tune of Rs 25,000 crore into the private insurance companies. The move would help insurance firms to get the much—needed capital from overseas partners.
There are about two dozen private sector insurance firms, both in life and non—life segment in the country.
Economy
Economy was and is in a challenging situation and one of the primary challenges is to restore confidence in economy, the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, today said.
He added that the tax policy cannot be ultra aggressive given challenges before economy.
GST
On GST, he said last stage of discussions were on with States on its implementation.
PSU banks
The Finance Minister said that the government planned to bring down its stake in PSU banks to 52 per cent.
Pakistan
If repeated ceasefire violation takes place, then environment for dialogue suffers, says Jaitley.

Mutual funds equity folio count expands by over 7 lakh in Apr-OctEquity mutual funds added more than seven lakh investor accounts or folios in the first seven months of the current fiscal (2014-15) in view of sharp rally in the stock market.
Folios are numbers designated to individual investor accounts, though one investor can have multiple folios.
According to Securities and Exchange Board of India data on investor accounts with 45 fund houses, number of equity folios rose to 2,9917,974 at last month-end from 2,91,80,922 at the end of the last fiscal (March 31, 2014), registering a gain of 7,37,052 folios during April-October period this year.
The additions came at a time when the market was scaling new highs.
The month of April saw the first rise in more than four years. Prior to that, the equity mutual fund (MF) sector had seen a continuous closure of folios since March 2009 after the market crashed due to the global financial crisis in late 2008. Since March 2009, it has seen a closure of 1.5 crore folios.
The investor base reached its peak of 4.11 crore in March 2009, while it was 3.77 crore in March 2008.
Industry experts said that strong rally in the equity market and the consequent rise in investors’ interest led to a sharp increase in retail folios.
“There has been rise in Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) registration and a lot of close-ended schemes have been launched by mutual fund houses in the past few months and the rise in such activities are supported by a sharp surge in equity market,” Quantum Mutual Fund Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Patel said.
The addition in equity folios is in line with BSE’s benchmark Sensex surging by 25 per cent in the first seven months of the current financial year.
Moreover, mutual funds industry reported net inflows of nearly Rs 34,000 crore in equity funds in the April-September period of the current fiscal (2014-15), which helped the industry grow its folio count.
Overall, the industry retail folios surged to 3.97 crore at October-end from 3.95 crore at the end of March.

Both the indices end marginally higher after touching new peakFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Both the indices, sensex and nifty, ended marginally higher after touching life-time high in a truncated trading week.
This was on strong buying mainly in Realty, Healthcare, Banking and IT sectors despite mild profit-booking from operators in Metal, Power, Auto and Consumer Durable.
The Sensex conquered the 28,000 mark for the first time on expectations of more reforms by the Modi government and a rate cut by the RBI.
Markets were enthused after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised reforms in labour, land acquisition and insurance laws and expressed readiness to look at privatisation of some loss-making public sector companies.
Strong foreign capital inflows coupled with higher European cues mainly boosted the domestic market sentiment, even as services sector activity in India stagnated during October amid weaker growth of new orders as per an HSBC survey.
“The fall in crude oil prices will have a positive impact on, among other things, inflation….it will embolden the RBI to cut rates,” said HDFC Securities in a note.
The sensex resumed higher at 27,943.04 and shot up further to an all-time high of 28,010.39 on initial strong buying. However, it declined afterwards to 27,739.56 before concluding the week at 27,868.33, showing a marginal gain of 2.70 points or 0.01 pct.
The CNX 50-share Nifty also moved by 14.80 points or 0.18 per cent to finish at 8,337.00 after touching an all-time high level of 8,365.55 during the week.

Sensex takes a breather after heady rally ahead of key dataFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Benchmark indices ended flat-to-positive in a holiday-shortened week after gaining more than 7% since the week ended October 17 as investors refrained from placing big bets ahead of key economic data.
The street is keenly awaiting the monthly industrial output and retail inflation (CPI) data on Wednesday, and the wholesale price inflation (WPI) numbers on Friday.
Sensex ended the week higher by 2.8 points, or 0.01%, from the previous week at 27,868.63. The 30-share gauge touched the psychological mark of 28,000 on Wednesday. The 50-share Nifty ended higher by 0.17% (14.8 points) at 8,337. There were two trading holidays in the week — Muharram and Guru Nanak Jayanti.
Broader markets outperformed the benchmark indices, given the valuations comfort. The BSE Mid-Cap and Small-Cap indices each rose 1.7% from the previous week. The Mid-Cap index is still below its all-time highs of early 2008 and trades at 13.5 times earnings compared to about 19 times for the Sensex.
Overseas funds remained net buyers of Indian equities for the sixth consecutive session on Friday. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) purchased about $418.37 million of shares in the cash segment on Friday — the biggest single-day purchase since July 3. FPIs have now purchased close to $1.5 billion in the last six sessions.
Foreign funds, who have been driving the Indian markets for over a decade, have invested close to $14.8 billion so far this year — the most among eight Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. The purchases have helped the Sensex climb 32% this year, the best performance among the world’s 40 biggest markets.
Real estate and pharmaceutical stocks were in focus this week. The BSE Realty index was the top performer with 5.7% gains. The BSE Healthcare index advanced 3.7% from the previous week.
Dr Reddy’s Laboratories rallied 4.42% — the biggest single-day gain since July this year — to a record as the company received USFDA approval for generic version of antiviral drug Valcyte. Dr Reddy’s has gained more than 12% in the last five sessions.
Realty major DLF surged 6.3% after an appeals court granted interim relief to the Gurgaon-based company to redeem mutual funds worth R1,800 crore for repayment of loans.
Hero MotoCorp declined 2.6% on Friday, taking this week’s loss to 5.8%, after PE firm Bain Capital was said to have sold shares in the motorcycle maker. Mahindra & Mahindra fell more than 1%. HDFC Bank declined 1.5%, while SBI slid 1.4%.
Ashok Leyland gained 1.5% after the company’s second-quarter profit of R121 crore exceeded the median analyst estimate of R20.5 crore.
Sixteen of the 20 Sensex members that have declared results so far have beaten or matched estimates. Earnings of companies on the gauge are likely to expand 23% over the next 12 months vs 15% for companies on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

BSE Sensex edges lower on profit-taking; US jobs dataeyedFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Stock markets took a breather today with benchmark Sensex falling about 47 points in volatile trade, retreating from record highs, as investors booked profits in banking, metal and capital goods sector stocks.
After remaining positive in early trade, the Sensex touched the day’s high of 27,980.93. However, investors took some profits off the table at near record levels which pushed the BSE index to day’s low of 27,739.56. A round of buying at the fag-end helped to trim losses. The Sensex settled with a loss of 47.25 points, or 0.17 per cent, at 27,868.63.
Among Sensex components, 21 stocks including BHEL, GAIL, Coal India, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Steel and Hindalco fell.
In the previous session on Wednesday, the 30-share Sensex had ended at its all-time closing high of 27,915.88 after touching an intra-day record high of 28,010.39. Continued foreign fund inflows on government’s reform push amid hopes of a rate cut by the RBI had fuelled the rally.
Likewise, the 50-scrip NSE barometer Nifty, which had gained 14.15 points in the previous session, fell 1.30 points, or 0.02 per cent, to close at 8,337.00. During today’s session, it dipped below the 8300-mark to touch a low of 8,290.25. It had closed at an all-time high of 8,338.30 and recorded lifetime intra-day high of 8,365.55 on Wednesday.
Banking sector stocks saw a round of selling after remaining outperformers in the recent rally. Major losers were SBI and HDFC Bank.
Bucking the overall trend, shares in healthcare, realty, consumer durables and IT sectors continued their upward march.
Shares of DLF rose over 6 per cent after the Securities Appellate Tribunal allowed the realty giant to redeem mutual funds worth Rs 1,806 crore. Traders said market was in an over-bought position and participants preferred to lock gains at lifetime highs.
Sectorally, the BSE Metal index suffered the most by losing 1.27 per cent, followed by Capital Goods 0.72 per cent, Power by 0.65 per cent and Auto 0.46 per cent among others.
Globally, there was a mixed closing in Asian markets while Europe saw a higher opening. All eyes are now on the US monthly jobs report.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 1,030.85 crores on Wednesday, as per provisional data released by the stock exchanges.
 

Gold price falls to multi-year low at Rs 25 800 on overseascuesGold futures price falls on global cues
Gold and silver prices slumped to their multi-year lows to trade at Rs 25,800 per 10 grams and Rs 34,900 per kg, respectively in the national capital today amid weak cues from global markets as strengthening dollar curbed demand for the precious metals.
In addition, absence of buying by jewellers and retailers on hopes that gold may see further slide in its prices in coming days, dampened sentiments.
Bullion merchants said besides a weak trend in the global market where gold fell to its lowest level since April 2010 as surging dollar eroded demand for safe-haven, considerable fall in demand from jewellers and retailers on hopes of further correction in prices, weighed on the precious metal.
Gold in Singapore, which normally determines price trend on the domestic front, lost 0.90 per cent to USD 1,132.16 an ounce, the lowest since April 2010 and silver dropped by 2.3 per cent to USD 15.06 an ounce, the lowest since February 2010.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity dropped by Rs 100 each to trade at Rs 25,800 and Rs 25,600 per 10 grams, respectively, a level last seen in August 2011.
Meanwhile, gold prices have declined by a whopping Rs 2,000 per 10 grams since Diwali on October 23.
Sovereign, however, held steady at Rs 23,600 per piece of eight grams on scattered support.
In line with an overall weak trend, silver ready dipped below the Rs 35,000-mark for the first time since October 2010 to close down by Rs 150 at Rs 34,900 per kg.
Silver weekly-based delivery dipped by Rs 330 to Rs 34,400 per kg.
Silver coins, however, recovered by Rs 2,000 to Rs 59,000 for buying and Rs 60,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Some Mutual funds miffed as AMFI kept them in dark on Maruti panelFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Some mutual fund houses are piqued at being kept in the dark about setting up a committee by their industry association Association of Mutual Funds of India to discuss the common stand on Maruti’s controversial plan to set up a plant in Gujarat, industry sources said here today.
The AMFI panel has been formed to discuss Maruti’s plans to set up its Gujarat plant as a fully-owned arm of its Japanese parent Suzuki as well as take a common position on similar cases where minority shareholders’ interests are involved.
After Maruti rejected mutual funds’ demand not go ahead with the Gujarat plan and instead hold an extraordinary general body meeting later this month, the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) had set up a panel to take a common mutual fund industry position on the issue.
As many as seven MFs hold 6.5 per cent stake in the country’s largest car maker, while LIC holds 6.83 per cent.
Some fund houses felt that AMFI should have informed them about the decision to form the panel on the issue. They have contended that the committee’s decision would not be binding on them while using their voting rights.
SBI Mutual Fund, which holds some stake in Maruti-Suzuki and has been kept out of the process, has been very critical about the manner in which the AMFI board constituted the committee.
Though the talks were on among mutual fund houses about formation of the committee for quite some time, many fund houses were not informed about the decision to set up the committee, the SBI MF said.
“Normally we are informed about any such decisions taken by the AMFI. However, this time we didn’t receive any communication from the association. Once we get some mail from AMFI in this connection, we will definitely take a call on whether to raise a questions about the issue,” SBI MF Managing Director and Chief Executive Dinesh Khara told PTI.
Maruti-Suzuki’s plan to set up a car plant in Gujarat as a fully-owned subsidiary of its Japanese parent has already been objected to by seven mutual fund houses holding stakes in the car company.
A decision on the proposed plant is likely to be taken by Maruti after its forthcoming extraordinary general meeting which is likely to be held later this month. It needs to get the permission of at least 75 per cent of shareholders for investment in the plant.
LIC Nomura MF, which holds 0.04 per cent stake in Maruti, has also been kept in the dark about the decision. However, it felt that it will raise objections in case any decision is taken by the committee and which was not informed to the MF house in advance.
“Formation of a committee was within the purview of the AFMI. However, we will raise a question before the association in case any decision is taken by the committee without keeping us informed,” LIC Nomura MF Chief Executive Nilesh Sathe said.
While LIC is the single largest minority investor in the country’s largest car maker with 6.8 per cent holding, seven mutual funds hold around 6.53 per cent and domestic financial institutions hold 7.95 per cent in the country’s largest carmaker.
An official of LIC said the financial giant is yet to take a view on the Maruti-Suzuki’s plan.
“A committee is a good forum to have consultation within the industry on issues related to corporate governance. However, any decision to be taken by the committee will not be binding on us when we exercise our voting rights,” Union KBC Mutual Fund Chief Executive G Pradeepkumar said.
However, the Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS) has welcomed the AMFI move.
“It’s good to know that mutual funds and institutional investors are thinking about some critical transactions and getting more active, because every single vote of mutual fund houses, big or small, will count during the EGM of the company,” IIAS Chief Operating Officer Hetal Dalal said.

Market outlook: Inflation  IIP data  cabinet reshuffle key for mkts  say expertsInflation data for October, industrial output numbers for September, quarterly earnings of blue-chips such as Tata Motors, ONGC and SBI, as also the first reshuffle of the Union Cabinet would dictate the stock markets trend this week, say experts.
Besides, overseas investments and movement of the rupee against the dollar would be crucial for markets.
“Movement of index in near-term will depend on upcoming IIP, CPI & WPI data and second quarter results of important companies,” said Vivek Gupta, CMT-Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.
Several blue-chips are slated to announce their earnings this week, including Tata Steel, Cipla, Tata Power, DLF, Hindalco Industries, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Tata Motors, Bharat Heavy Electricals, ONGC and State Bank of India.
Industrial production data for September would come out on Wednesday.
Inflation based on combined consumer price indices (CPI) for October would also come on Wednesday, while inflation based on wholesale price index (WPI) would be announced on Friday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today expanded his Council of Ministers, a move that was hailed by the industry as a further step towards faster reforms.
The benchmark BSE Sensex concluded the week at 27,868.63, showing a marginal gain of just 2.8 points.
“We expect the markets to gain medium-term support from 7,900-7,950 levels. FII flows are pretty strong in the past fortnight and their trend in the coming sessions, coupled with global cues, shall guide the market direction from this point,” said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.

Will continue to guide Goa govt: ParrikarLetters to  the editor
Former Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar has said he has been asked by the BJP high command to guide the Laxmikant Parsekar-led state government, even after he takes over a bigger role at the Centre.
“I will always be guiding Goa government. I may not interfere with the state government, but I will be helping it in the policy decisions. The party high command has asked me to take that role,” Parrikar told PTI, before leaving for Delhi to be inducted today into the Union Cabinet where he is tipped to get the Defence portfolio.
Parrikar, the BJP’s popular face in the state, said he has been asked by the party to help the team in Goa.
“You will not find me interfering with the government, but my role would be restricted to (guiding in) policy decisions,” he said.
Goa’s new Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar had told the media yesterday that Parrikar would be consulted for important decisions, including the upcoming Cabinet expansion and allocation of portfolios.
Parrikar said during his two-and-half years’ tenure as CM, he worked at a pace three times more than normal.
“I was handling the administration single-handedly. I was working for seven days, putting in 16 hours of work a day. Even if you calculate the number of hours put in, you can feel that it is two-and-half times more than normal,” he said.
“God has given me a good knack of administrative capabilities. That helped me in governing the state,” the 58-year-old leader said, admitting that he wanted to complete the tenure (to end in 2017).
The former chief minister said the support and love extended to him by the people of Goa was enormous.
“…Goa has a typical character. If you are loved here, you will get love in abundance and if you are hated, then people will boot you out,” Parrikar said.

JP Nadda: The laidback highlanderThe PM reposes trust in low-profile organisation man
New Delhi, November 9:  
The quiet and retiring Jagat Prakash Nadda from Himachal Pradesh is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s choice over the younger MP and BJP Yuva Morcha chief Anurag Thakur as the sole representative from the northern hill State in the Union Cabinet.
A former minister in his home State, Nadda has been a General Secretary in the central BJP since 2010 and was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2012.
For the last four years that he has been in Delhi, Nadda has barely interacted with the media or bothered cultivating senior leaders, a quality that is clearly valued in the present ruling establishment.
Known for keeping his head down and following order in the organisation ranks, Nadda has known the Prime Minister since he was handling political affairs in Himachal, Haryana and Punjab as the party General Secretary in the late 1990’s.
Although he hails from Vijaypur village in the Bilaspur district of HP, Nadda grew up in Bihar and studied in Patna. He went back to his home State for higher studies, joining Himachal Pradesh University during the turbulent 1970s.
Student leader
There he joined the RSS’s student wing, the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and was active in the JP Movement. During his leadership, the ABVP defeated the Students Federation of India (SFI) for the first time in the Left-dominated campus and Nadda became the student union president.
He rose to become the top functionary of the RSS as General Secretary (Organisation) in the Himachal Pradesh State BJP unit before Murli Manohar Joshi appointed him president of the BJP’s youth wing, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.
Nadda won his first Assembly election from Bilaspur in 1993 at the peak of an anti-BJP wave in the hill State. In 1998, he became Health Minister in PK Dhumal’s Cabinet.
He lost the 2003 Assembly Elections but won again in 2007 and was appointed Forest Minister by Dhumal where he earned a reputation for being upright and honest.
The laidback highlander is now being rewarded for his discretion, honesty and administrative experience.

Credit quality is not getting any worse‘Credit quality is not getting any worse’
Radhika Merwin
Tweet
R Sivakumar, Head - Fixed Income & Products, Axis Mutual Fund, believes that it is a good time for investors to invest in longer duration funds. Over the next six months, he expects yields on the 10-year G-Sec to fall below 8 per cent and anticipates one policy rate cut by the RBI within that timeframe.
What are your expectations on the rate front? 
We believe that the RBI is over-cautious on inflation. In the latest policy document, while the RBI has stated that it is comfortable with retail inflation achieving the targeted 8 per cent by January 2015, it has indicated upside risks to achieving the targeted 6 per cent by January 2016. But if we look at the latest inflation figures, the headline CPI inflation is down to 6.46 per cent and the core CPI is down to 5.9 per cent.
So it’s no longer food inflation that is keeping inflation high; overall inflation is trending lower to 6 per cent levels.
So the 2016 target of 6 per cent is well within reach. What this means is that it opens up room for rate cuts over the next six months. Sometime early next year, we expect the RBI to cut rates.
The US raising rates some time next year may also impact the RBI’s decision on rate cuts…
 The US Fed may hike rates in the middle of 2015 and for this reason, the RBI is mindful of the fact that it cannot cut rates aggressively. But also important to note is that a lot of things have happened over the last one year or so. For one, the fiscal deficit has come off sharply. This year (2014-15), the fiscal deficit will be at 4.1 per cent of GDP.
The new targets for the next two years are aggressive, at 3.5 and 3 per cent of GDP. This means that the fiscal deficit has to consolidate at a faster pace than earlier estimated. Two, the current account deficit has come down to 0-2 per cent of GDP. So the twin deficit problem is now under control. All of this should give the RBI comfort when they look at rate cuts.
Despite the key policy rate left unchanged for a while now, the yield on G-Sec has already started to trend lower…
In the G-Sec market, particularly on the longer end, the yields not only track the current repo rate, but also the future trajectory of this rate. So for instance, in January 2013, the RBI cut the repo rate from 8 per cent to 7.75 per cent, but this was done in the end of January.
However, by early January itself, the 10-year G-Sec yield was at 7.75 per cent. So the market starts to price in a rate cut beforehand. That is what is happening now and the market is moving toward a rate cut expectation.  
So where do you think G-Sec yields will settle by the end of March?
Over the next six months, we expect yields to fall below 8 per cent and expect one rate cut by the RBI within that time frame.
So is it a good time to invest in gilt funds? What is the duration you are maintaining in your funds?
Yes, we believe it is a good time for investors to invest in longer duration funds. However, the risk appetite of the investor will decide the type of fund. Risk-averse investors can go for short-term funds, while risk-takers can invest in gilt or income funds. For Axis funds in particular, both our income and bond funds are running a higher duration of about seven years.  
These two funds in particular have not performed very well when compared to other schemes. Why?
When we compare peers in this space, different funds follow different strategies. In the dynamic and income peer group, funds investing in money market instruments, short-term and long-term debt instruments — all get clubbed together. In the last three to four years, rates have broadly gone up. So we still haven’t seen a full rate cycle yet. Longer duration funds will tend to perform well in a rate cut cycle. 
What kind of credit risk are you taking in your bond portfolio? How do you think the rating for corporate India will pan out?
 In the very near term, we believe that the deterioration in credit performance has stopped. Credit quality is not getting any worse than last year. That said, we feel that the credit quality will not improve very significantly in the near term either. So we will continue to invest in better-rated debt papers for now.

1 mn bank accts  Rs 120 lakh cr black money abroad  BJP s SwamyNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Subramanian Swamy today expressed hope that the black money stashed in foreign banks would return to the country in about one year.
“We are optimistic that the black money stashed in foreign banks would return to the country in about one year time, much before the expectation of the people,” Swamy told reporters here.
Rejecting apprehension that the Centre was taking time on the matter of bringing black money back, Swamy said it was taking some time as about one million bank accounts have been opened by Indians in 70 odd countries.
About Rs 120 lakh crore were stashed in foreign banks, the senior BJP leader said.
On the National Herald case in which Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were named, Swamy said, “The Supreme Court in 2007 had given a direction to set up a special investigation team for the purpose. But, they did nothing till the NDA government came to the power.
“There has been an attempt to grab properties worth Rs 5,000 crore simply by forming a private limited company in the name of Young Indian Ltd by Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Motilal Vora and others,” Swamy said about the case initiated by him.
Stating that the paid off capital of the company was only Rs 5 lakh, Swamy alleged there had been fraud, breach of trust by manipulation.
“Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi own 76 per cent of the share on the private limited company,” he pointed out.
Swamy claimed that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, as majority shareholders of Young Indian Ltd (YIL), benefited from the acquisition of Associated Journals Ltd (AJL).

Pak Occupied Kashmir would love to join IndiaLetters to  the editor
The chairman of Anjuman Minhaj-e-Rasool, an Islamic organisation working for peace and communal harmony, today said that if given a chance the residents of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) would love to join the Union of India.
“If a plebiscite is held in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, more than 99 per cent people there would vote to become a part of the Union of India,” Anjuman Minhaj-e-Rasool chairman Maulana Syed Athar Dehlavi told reporters here.
Dehlavi, who was in Jammu after a five-day visit to flood affected areas of Jammu and Kashmir, said the separatists in Kashmir has lost their grounds and the people in the Valley are talking about good governance and development.
“The separatists in Kashmir have lost their ground and the people in the Valley are discussing issues like good governance, development and education. They are not bothered about what a handful of people are saying,” Dehlavi said.
Dehlavi said during his visit to Kashmir he found that the flood-affected people were all praise for the relief and rescue operations launched by the army.
“The people are praising the army as their savior. The army has done a wonderful job in Kashmir. The people in Kashmir have now realised that the army is their real savior,” he said.
Dehlavi also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “people friendly” policies in Jammu and Kashmir and the country.
He said his Anjuman Minhaj-e-Rasool was the only Islamic organisation that raised voice against Al-Qaida and other terrorist groups.
“When Kashmiri Pandits were forced to leave Kashmir we raised objection in the OIC in Jeddah and we were the one to condemn Osama Bin Laden and now we are strongly condemning Islamic State,” Dehlavi said.

ICICI Bank: On a steadycourseICICI Bank
Rating: Overweight
Q2FY15 earnings at Rs 27.1 bn (15% year-on-year) are in line with our estimates. Other income was slightly higher than our estimates due to Rs 1.65 bn gain from repatriation of profit from overseas branches offset by slightly higher provisioning.
Operating metrics loan growth moderated to 14% y-o-y as corporate growth remained subdued while retail book continued its growth momentum (25% y-o-y) led by mortgages and auto loans–as they entered new geographies. This led to the retail mix improving to 40%. Margins remained firm at 3.42% driven by healthy CASA mix (44%) and moderation in wholesale deposit costs. Fee income growth was moderate at16% y-o-y led by retail fees growing above 20% y-o-y and contributing to 60% of the total fees. Corporate fees, however, were lower due to weaker forex income and slowdown in corporate fees (transactional and commercial banking and lending related fees). Cost income ratio improved to 36.5% as the bank focused on leveraging its technology improvement by curtailing its staff expenses. GNPL (gross non-performing loan) ratio increased by 7 basis points to 3.12% as slippages increased to 1.9%. The restructured book was 3.05%, with the management indicating a pipeline of R18 bn for the remainder this year.

Earnings outlook: We continue to maintain stable asset quality outlook but increase our loan growth forecast slightly for FY16-17e to 21% y-o-y. Overall we expect steady performance with ROA (return on assets) in the range of 1.8-1.9% and ROE (return on equity) around 16-17% by FY16-17e.
Valuation and risks: ICICI is trading at 2.2x P/AB (price-to-adjusted book value) 12-month forward versus its five-year average of 1.8x P/AB, and 1.9x excluding subsidiaries. We value the stock at 2x 12-month forward adj.book on single stage Gordon growth model, thus, slightly increasing our TP to R1,910 (from R1,814) implying a potential return of 20%.

Strong market share performance across all segments: MSIL’s market share performance has remained strong over the past year. Its market share in the passenger vehicles segment rose to 45.5% in H1FY15 compared with 43.6% in FY14 and 41.2% in FY13. In our view, MSIL’s outperformance has been helped by: (i) continued strong growth in rural areas– rural volumes increased 16% y-o-y in FY14 and 26% y-o-y in Q1FY15; (ii) first-time buyer mix has risen to 42% in H1FY15, from 37% in FY14 –MSIL has very high market share (70%) in the entry segment and (iii) successful launch of its Celerio model–6,000 units/ month.
We expect MSIL’s new launch momentum to stay strong over the next two years, which should help it sustain the outperformance. Market share performance was strong across all segments. Here, we would like to highlight two points: (i) A steep improvement in market share in the hatchback segment in FY15 led by the success of Celerio (58-60% so far vs. 44% in FY14); and (ii) MSIL has held on to its market share in the sedan segment despite two launches–Honda Amaze and Hyundai Xcent– which is quite positive. With more launches planned in the UV (utility vehicle) segment over two years, we expect MSIL to improve its market share from 10-12% currently.

Raising FY17F EPS estimate by 9%: Our FY15-17F (forecast) volume estimates remain largely unchanged. We expect 13% volume growth in FY15F and 17% in FY16F. We raise our ASP (average selling price) estimates by 1-3% for FY15-17F to account for a better product mix–more launches in the high-end segment. Our FY15-16F Ebitda margin estimates is largely unchanged while we have raised our FY17F Ebitda margin by 50 bp. Based on currency rates, Ebitda margins can improve by 60bp from Q2 levels. We build in a 1% reduction in discounts over the next two years (FY16-17F).
Overall, we raise our FY15F EPS (earnings per share) estimate by 5%; our FY16F EPS estimate is largely unchanged, while our FY17F EPS estimate is up by 9%.
Conservative depreciation policy vs. peers:We note that MSIL follows a conservative depreciation policy compared to its domestic peers. MSIL’s depreciation rate (based on average gross fixed assets ex-land) is around 11% which is much higher than, say, M&M, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. Thus, MSIL’s earnings quality is better than the rest.
Dividend payout ratio to increase going ahead: MSIL’s board has decided to increase the dividend payout ratio to 18-30% going ahead, from 10-15% earlier. We are building in a 20% dividend payout ratio for FY15-17F into our estimates. However, we note that MSIL still remains a growth stock—at the current price, we estimate the dividend yield at 1% for FY16F.
Reiterate Buy; TP raised to R3,660: We retain our SOTP (sum-of-the-parts) valuation methodology. We value MSIL at R3,813/share based on 18x consolidated FY17F EPS of R212. We then roll back our TP (target price) by four months to Nov-15 at a 13% cost of equity to arrive at our 12-month TP of R3,660.
Given factors like an economic recovery, lower oil prices and benign commodity prices, the outlook for the auto sector is strong. The sector multiples will likely remain towards the higher end of the historical trading range. Further, for Maruti specifically, we foresee some structural changes taking place over the next one-two years: (i) start of its R&D centre in India, leading to faster model rollouts; (ii) a possible fall in royalty rates on new models post higher local R&D; (iii) reduced earnings volatility on lower import content and (iv) likely upside to FCF (free cash flow) from the Gujarat plant deal.
Given the above, we expect MSIL to trade at 16-20x FY17F EPS . We peg our target multiple at 18x FY17F EPS—at the mid-end of our expected trading range. If the four-wheeler industry volume growth is stronger, the stock can trade at 20x FY17F EPS–at the higher-end.

Web & mobile-driven sales at McDonald’s, KFC on the rise, helping them cut costs by half
Ratna Bhushan, ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 06.52AM IST
(The restaurant chains add…)
NEW DELHI: Hungry? If you have a smartphone, you can order a burger online and be rest assured McDonald's is lovin' it. But that's not the only chain that likes online orders. Domino's, KFC, restaurants like Mainland China and Punjab Grill and even local outfits such as Biryani Zone are pushing this route aggressively in an environment that continues to see sales and profits under pressure.
Why? Online orders slash the cost of restaurant chains by half because they reduce the dependence on call centres as these are routed directly from the website to the relevant outlet. They are also more convenient as they allow customers to order from anywhere — on the move or unable to make a phone call. The restaurant chains add that orders through apps help them inform customers about offers, promotions and new menu items, not always possible when an order is placed by phone and is dependent on how effectively the call centre operator can communicate.
"Sheer convenience is driving online ordering numbers," said Harneet Singh Rajpal, senior VP, marketing, at Jubilant FoodWorks. The company said its mobile ordering app has crossed 2 million downloads across smartphones, with the online contribution to delivery sales in the July-September quarter touching 27%, compared with 18% in the year earlier.
"People downloading apps on their mobiles or through their iPads or computer screens is not only a personalised way to order, it also saves us time and costs since the orders are flashed directly on kitchen screens of the concerned restaurants," Rajpal added. Jubilant reported a 5.3% decline in same-store sales compared with 6.6% in the year-ago quarter and a 12.7% decline in standalone net profit to .`29 crore in the July-September quarter.
In global markets such as the US, web and mobile ordering contributes more than 50-60% to sales of restaurants. In India, the trend is gaining ground very rapidly, said experts. Harminder Sahni, founder of consulting firm Wazir Advisors, said: "Online ordering can bring down cost by up to 40-50%... There is a direct correlation as the firms save on maintenance of call centre costs which reduces pressure on profitability."
McDonald's west and south region operator Hardcastle Restaurants revamped its online delivery business this January in recognition of the trend. "Ever since, contribution of our online delivery business has gone up from 5% to about 30% now," said Amit Jatia, vice-chairman of Hardcastle, which runs 192 restaurants across the region. "With web and mobile ordering, it is very rewarding to report positive results in an intensely competitive market, even though we expect economic challenges to persist in the near term," Jatia added.
Harcastle reported a 7.9% decline in same store sales in the July-September compared with 5.5% in corresponding year-ago quarter. For KFC, Yum Restaurants' fastest-growing restaurant chain in India, online orders are almost a fourth of its delivery sales, a spokesperson said. Yum's India division system sales for the July-September quarter were down 4%.
Online food ordering platform foodpanda. in, which connects 4,000 restaurants in 100 cities and operates in 40-plus countries, said its mobile app has now crossed 5 million downloads. Foodpanda.in co-founder Rohit Chadda said even fine-dining restaurants such as Mainland China and Punjab Grill are getting traction on online orders. "While a combination of orders placed through computers and mobile apps is driving sales, there is a clear emerging preference towards using mobile apps for online ordering, ahead of computers or tablets." Chadda said.

Big opportunity to co-create in India: Furla...categories
(It has been a very complicated…)
Eraldo Poletto, CEO of Italian fashion brand Furla, came to India in the summer of last year when his company was awaiting a nod from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board to form a joint venture with local partner Genesis Luxury. Poletto had then said Furla, primarily known for its bags, would make investments in India at "superfast speed" once the approval came through. But the nod didn't come. Poletto says it's one of the complexities of doing business in India. While Furla is no longer keen on the JV, it will continue expanding its presence in India, he told Vijaya Rathore in an interview. Edited excerpts:
What happened to your investment proposal to form a joint venture with Genesis in India? I believe it has been withdrawn...
It has been a very complicated process. We got stuck by all the paper work and a few details. I guess it is part of the complexity of doing business in this country. So, the investment proposal is irrelevant at this stage. For now we decided have to move on and focus on expanding the business here with the partner.
Tell us about the brand's portfolio expansion and marketing push globally.
The year 2015 will be the year of marketing for Furla with a lot of investments going in brand building in all markets. We are getting into new categories. We are set to launch an extensive shoe collection for women and have already launched men's collection, especially for Asia starting with Japan. The key is to communicate that we are not just a bag brand. We are even considering getting into other categories such as watches, which may be outsourced.
Do you plan to launch men's products in India?
Not now and that's because of the challenges like lack of quality real estate. You need big stores to showcase entire product line which remains a challenge here. We'll launch shoes for women, but menswear will have to wait.
What's Furla's growth target globally? How are you doing in India?
In 2013, we closed the year with sales of $227 million. In the next 4-5 years the aim is to double the size of the business globally. Italy and Japan are the largest markets currently and India is doing well too. Indian consumers are very important as they also buy while travelling abroad.
Have you thought of design partnerships in India?
It would be something really interesting to do. There is a great opportunity in this market for co-creating something. I look at it as a way to express respect to the country with such a rich cultural heritage. But it has to be something genuine as consumers here think with their hearts.

Nifty seen opening higher; L&T eyed post Q2 resultseconomy
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open higher on Monday following positive trend seen in other Asian markets. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to surpass its previous record high of 8365.55 in trade today.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 12 points higher at 8,406 indicating a flat-to-positive opening on the domestic market.
Investors will keep a close eye on L&T which reported its results for the quarter ended September 30 post market hours on Friday.
Consolidated net profit rose 7 per cent to Rs 861.75 crore in July-September from a year earlier and revenue climbed 11 per cent to Rs 21,159.35 crore, L&T said in a statement.
Nifty remained very range bound throughout the session on Friday and oscillated in and out of the negative territory to finally conclude the day almost flat at 8,337 losing 1 point on Friday. The Sensex was down by 47 points at 27868.
Present upside momentum still appears strong and may remain so till the time Nifty trades above the level of 8,290 levels, say experts and a move below 8290 may signal further correction till 8220 to 8200 range.
"But, the index has a key support placed at 8170 and as long as 8170 is respected as a support despite any correction the present move may even extend higher till 8460," GEPL Capital said in a report.
"The level of 8460 is the resistance offered by the upper band of an advancing Channel it has been trading in since May 2014 till date. Only a move below 8170 would signal weakness on positional basis," added the report.
On Friday, US stocks ended flat after the jobs report for October trailed expectations even while showing solid growth.
Employers added 214,000 jobs in October and unemployment fell to a six-year low of 5.8 percent, underscoring the U.S. economy's resilience while the global economy faces slowing demand, Reuters reported.
Wall Street ended little changed on Friday, though the Dow and the S&P 500 eked out record closing highs and the three major indexes all managed to post gains for the week, added the report.
Asian shares held firm in early Monday trade after U.S. jobs data pointed to solid economic growth, while China's export performance showed more resilience than some had expected.
Asian shares were trading higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was trading 0.64 per cent lower at 16,777 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 1.8 per cent higher at 23,988.
South Korea's Kospi index was trading 1.1 per cent higher at 1,962 and China's Shanghai index was trading 1.1 per cent higher at 2,445.

‘Kiss of Love’ arrests and the heckler’s veto

With the police successfully silencing participants, the law has acknowledged a veto power in hecklers who can get the law to silence any speaker of whom they do not approve
There is something poisonous about a democracy in which couples are arrested for kissing . This reaction by the state to the non-violent ‘Kiss of Love’ protest in Kerala proved the protesters’ point very effectively: while those who attack young people and vandalise cafes will go scot-free, the police will choose to lock up peaceful protestors. It does not bode well for freedom of expression in our democracy if intolerant and violent groups are able to leverage state institutions to prevent other citizens from exercising their rights.
A group called the ‘Free Thinkers’ organised the ‘Kiss of Love’ as a protest against increasing moral policing. The Facebook page for the site says of the event that ‘…young bloods join their hands together to prove to the society that kiss is the symbol of love’. The protest was announced after Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha volunteers vandalised a cafe in Kozhikode claiming that they were prompted to do so by the “immoral activities” that took place in the cafe. Media speculation indicates that this was a reference to footage of youngsters kissing in the cafe.
The Shiv Sena reportedly declared the protest a new form of ‘love-jihad’ and said that it would cause sexual anarchy in Kerala. In addition to the Shiv Sena, right wing activists from across religious lines including the Yuva Morcha, ABVP, Bajrang Dal, Social Democratic Party of India and radical Hindu and Muslim groups were united in their protests against the ‘Kiss of Love’. Although the Kerala High Court refused a petition to prohibit the event, the police eventually rounded up and locked away over fifty organisers and supporters of the ‘Kiss of Love’.
It is clear from this that the ‘Kiss of Love’ protesters were attacked in two different ways. On one hand, there was the physical threat posed by the right wing ‘anti-kiss’ campaigners. On the other, the state used force to disperse the protest because of the law and order problem created by the anti-protest activists.
Situations where speakers are silenced by the state because an unruly crowd creates pressure through its violence are what American jurist Harry Kalven was trying to describe when he coined the term ‘heckler’s veto’. Kalven pointed out that “if the police can silence the speaker, the law in effect acknowledges a veto power in hecklers who can, by being hostile enough, get the law to silence any speaker of whom they do not approve”.
The Kerala ‘Kiss of Love’ incident is a classic illustration of this veto at work. There was no good reason why the police should have dispersed this non-violent and utterly reasonable protest. However the unruly mob succeeded in creating a sufficiently hostile environment to achieve this. This is not the first time that an aggressive mob has affected the fundamental rights of others in India.
Last month, the Madras High Court had to refuse a demand to ban Tamil films Kaththi and Pulipaarvai by people who felt that these films might be full of anti-Tamil speeches. In June, nine students in Kerala’s Thrissur district were arrested for provocation with intent to cause a riot over a rude anti-Modi crossword clue. In August, St. Xavier’s College retracted an invitation to Dalit activist Sheetal Sathe to speak at their annual festival ‘Malhar’ after the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad threatened the organisers.
Freedom of expression
The ‘Kiss of Love’ incident, therefore, follows Salman Rushdie’s aborted appearance at the Jaipur Literary Festival to become a part of the several cases in which extremists are able to stifle expression by threatening violence and disruption.
Restricting speech in the interests of public order was not permissible under the original text of the Indian Constitution. After the Supreme Court refused to allow the use of the ‘national security’ exception to restrain speech in the interest of law and order, the Nehru government added ‘public order’ among the reasons for which the right to free expression may be restricted under our Constitution. This resulted in the Supreme Court permitting prior restraint of speech in the interest of maintaining law and order. For example in Babulal Parate vs State of Maharashtra the court upheld anticipatory restriction of Article 19(1)(a) in the interests of public order, reasoning that ‘public order must be maintained in advance in order to ensure it’.
Over time, the judiciary has become conscious as to how law is leveraged to silence speakers. Although the Supreme Court has never actually used the phrase, it has acknowledged the dilemma that is termed the ‘heckler’s veto’. This was in S. Rangarajan v. P. Jagjivan Ram where it said “freedom of expression cannot be suppressed on account of threat of demonstration and processions or threats of violence… the State cannot plead its inability to handle the hostile audience problem”.
The phrase ‘heckler’s veto’ features in a 2006 Andhra Pradesh High Court judgment, Lakshmi Ganesh Films and Ors. vs Government Of A.P., where the court examined a state government notification suspending the screening of the film The Da Vinci Code. Justice Raghuram’s compelling judgment supports both the right to freedom of expression and the right to receive information. It states categorically “dissenters of speech and expression have no censorial right in respect of the intellectual, moral, religious, dogmatic or other choices of all mankind”, and announces that the State government’s censorship order “mechanically certified the heckler's veto of a few objectors”. It is hoped that the judiciary continues to protect speech as firmly, and the legal framework is made more resistant to compliance with the heckler’s veto.
United in intolerance
Last year, a kissing protest was staged in a Turkish metro station in response to a morality campaign by Ankara authorities. The police tried to prevent protestors from going into the station, and Islamists attacked the demonstrators, resulting in the stabbing of one person. A ‘kiss-in’ held in Morocco to protest the arrest of two teenagers for kissing was also attacked by Islamist counter-protestors.
It is a matter of concern how extremists everywhere seem united in their opposition to expressions of affection. Take the Shiv Sena and its terming of the Kerala ‘Kiss of Love’ event as an instance of ‘love jihad’ oblivious to the fact that extreme Islamist groups also support punishing all displays of public affection. Extremist groups have always been present and will always jockey for leverage. What is critical is that the law and the state institutions do not support them as they seek to curtail other citizens’ democratic rights.
Robert Post, eminent First Amendment Scholar and Dean of Yale Law School, wrote that a heckler’s veto creates very bad incentives for those who oppose free expression since it permits an angry mob to use the law to silence speakers. This threatens the open public discussion that is critical to democracy.
The ‘Kiss of Love’ protestors were not the ones causing public disorder. That distinction belongs to the intolerant anti-protest activists who disrespected the protesters’ autonomy. When this extremism is facilitated by the state, through its failure to distinguish between peaceful protestors and the thugs who use law and order problems to threaten them, it becomes clear that our laws are being used to facilitate the heckler’s veto, not to protect citizens’ rights.

Faceoff in Hisar: police versus a godmans commandoforceThe ‘guards’ outside the ashram. (Source: Express photo by Gajendra Yadav)
Written by Dipankar Ghose , Varinder Bhatia | Barwala (hisar) | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:30 am
Four days after the Punjab and Haryana High Court issued a non-bailable warrant against a self-styled godman, Sant Rampal, and his aide, Ram Kumar Dhaka, for failing to appear before it in a case related to contempt of court, his supporters here on Sunday organised themselves into a “commando protection force” and said they would not allow the police to take him.
Through the day, a group of over 200 men, armed with helmets, sticks and other weapons, stood guard at the gates of the Satlok Ashram in Barwala. “We have formed a commando protection force, and will not allow anyone inside the ashram. We have formed two human chains, and have been given helmets to protect ourselves. Everyone will be deployed in shifts,” said one person, carrying a flag which said ‘Sat Sena’.
Over a lakh devotees gathered inside the ashram, pledging that the “unjust administration would only be able to reach Baba over our dead bodies”. Many, including women and the elderly, came for a “satsang”, but said they would fight for their Baba.
While Rampal has not made an appearance for the last three days, a huge television screen at one end of the ashram shows him speaking to disciples. One ashram member said that in case the police arrive, the TV screen would be used to notify supporters, “who will form a human chain around the sanctorum where Guruji stays.”
On Wednesday, the division bench rejected a medical reported submitted by Rampal’s counsel, which claimed that he was suffering from conjunctivitis, and ordered the Haryana DGP and district administration to make arrangements for the spiritual leader to be produced before the High Court on November 10.
A day later, the Satlok Ashram called a tactically-timed three-day “satsang” beginning Friday, ensuring the presence of its devotees. On Sunday, women and children sat near the Hisar Chandigarh highway, where the ashram is located, holding up banners decrying the “injustice” being meted out to their leader. Behind them were the armed men, all wearing blue.
Senior police officers said over 3,000 personnel had been deployed in the area. They said they would “wait and watch”, but did not dismiss the possibility of police action in the early hours of Monday.
“We are talking to them and hopefully a solution will emerge. We can only wait and see how the situation develops and try to tell them that the court’s directions have to be followed. We are prepared for any law and order contingency,” said Hisar SP Satyender Gupta.
Rampal’s aide Rahul Das, however, said Rampal would only go to court after he “recovers”. “Our stand is clear. There has been a series of injustices against Sant Rampal, but despite that he is willing to go to court. However, he has been unwell for the past few days, and there is a medical report to prove it… We believe that our guru is our court of law, continued…

This Mizoram village knew no crime  until a teachers arrest for molesting27The village has about 200 families, most of them relatives.
Written by Adam Halliday | Saichal (mizoram) | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:27 am
Till last month, Saichal, a remote village in Champhai district in east Mizoram, had never reported any crime. But that changed last week, with the arrest of a school teacher, H Lalhmingmawia, 30, on charges of molesting at least 27 students — aged between eight to 12 years — since 2011.
The village of about 200 families — most of them related to one another — is still in shock. “Frankly, we don’t even know how we ought to feel,” said P L Zuiliana, a resident.
It was Zuiliana who first heard a group of school girls discussing their teacher’s behaviour on the evening of November 2. “I scolded them and told them not to accuse someone with lies, but one of them replied, ‘It’s not a lie, he touched me till I started bleeding.’ That’s when they got my attention,” recalled Zuiliana.
As word spread, some parents met that night to discuss the issue. Among them was a retired teacher of the lone government primary school in the village — the grandfather of a girl who was allegedly raped thrice by Lalhmingmawia, the last time on October 30. “The next day, we went to the school and told a teacher about what we had heard. We started talking to the girls and made a list of all those who said they had been molested.
In all, 32 girls told us the teacher had touched them in an inappropriate manner,” said the retired teacher.
The police later said 27 girls had been molested. “I asked my granddaughter why she never said anything to me or to her parents or why she did not just cry for help. She said she was always raped behind closed doors,” said the retired teacher.
According to parents of the victims, Lalhmingmawia would ask those who did not know their lessons to stay back for extra classes. That was apparently when he used to molest them.
“We did not see the signs. The girls would wear leggings even when it was very warm. We would scold them, but they would insist on wearing leggings… They also hated the sessions when the teacher asked them their lessons,” said the mother of a victim.
The villagers pointed out that the teacher was an active member of the church’s local Christian youth unit, and was a father of three children — the older two attend the same school. He was hired by the village employment committee in 2011, with the villagers contributing their NREGA wages to pay his salary.
“We are a small village but we wanted to give our children a good education. We got the primary school upgraded to an English medium school in 2011, but we only had one regular teacher who was the headmistress. There were two non-regular teachers employed under the SSA, but we thought it would be a good idea to continued…

Why Sadananda Gowda was gently shuntedoutPrint
“Nice man” Gowda not being able to assert himself
Written by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:34 am | Updated: November 10, 2014 8:35 am
Over a month ago, Railway Minister Sadananda Gowda selected an Indian Railway Personnel Service officer to head the crucial ‘Confidential’ branch of the Railway Board. Despite a written order, however, the rail bureaucracy did not move, and the post remains vacant.
The months in office of the first Railway Minister of the Narendra Modi government is replete with instances of the ever-smiling, “nice man” Gowda not being able to assert himself. Several Railway officials said this could never have been said about Gowda’s predecessors Lalu Prasad or Mamata Banerjee.
The Railways are big in Modi’s scheme of things. The PM has given the Railways a list of 30-odd tasks needed to be performed for an overall turnaround. The PMO monitors progress monthly. A majority of these have made no tangible progress.
At the meeting on connectivity-related infrastructure targets convened by the PM last week, the Railways got a tongue-lashing as things did not seem to have moved as desired, sources said.
Gowda did, in fact, try. He called meetings of the entire Railway Board to review PM-monitored projects regularly. One of these meetings took place on a national holiday last week. He also invoked the Swachh Bharat campaign wherever he could.
But things did not move. Devoid of any big idea to lead the ministry that has the biggest people connect, Gowda was increasingly being seen as someone out of his depth, unable to get work done.
Suresh Prabhu, a man with a big reformist reputation and enjoying Modi’s trust, is expected to be a tactful leader who will be able to galvanise the Railways bureaucracy, be more in sync with the deliverables and outside-the-box ideas the PMO is interested in, and overall be a more impressive “brand ambassador” for the Railways.
Prabhu was quick off the blocks on Sunday: tweeting, within minutes of the portfolios being announced, “Railways could be the engine of growth if driven properly. Now in the drivers seat”, and “All those who work for the Railways must work towards realising Honourable PM’s dream”.
By contrast, Gowda’s official handle continued to describe him as “Minister for Railways”, his last tweet having been on November 8, wishing L K Advani a happy birthday.
Gowda failed to find a way to untangle the knot of big infra projects like the locomotive factories in Madhepura and Marhaura, to bring out a roadmap for FDI in Railways, and to show progress in apparently simpler tasks like making Wifi available on trains and stations — something the PMO has been wanting since June.
Officials said the former Karnataka chief minister was also overwhelmed by the complex ways of the Rail Bhavan bureaucracy. For the past four months, the ministry’s proposal to fill posts of seven general managers across India has been getting rejected by the PM-led Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, which has been finding faults with the file. The ACC has recently given scathing remarks on the way the Railways has continued…

(The battle for MCFL between…)
NEW DELHI: Deepak Fertilisers has bought an additional about 6 per cent stake in Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd (MCFL) for Rs 65.93 crore through an open offer, intensifying its takeover battle with Zuari Group.
The company purchased 70,44,397 shares in MCFL equivalent to 5.94 per cent in the open offer closed on October 20, Deepak Fertilisers said. The company had launched open offer at a price of Rs 93.60 per share on October 1.
Post open offer, Deepak Fertilisers has 31.25 per cent stake in the company whereas Rival Zuari-UB group combine, which had offered the counter bid at Rs 81.60 per share, could acquire only 48,000 shares and presently holds 38.4 per cent stake in MCFL.
After the latest round of takeover battle, Zuari group along with Vijay Mallaya's UB group needs about 12 per cent additional stake in MCFL to take control of the company while at the same time Deepak Fertilisers would require more than 18 per cent stake in the MCFL.
Both open offers were started on October 1 and closed on October 20.
The battle for MCFL between Deepak Fertilisers and Zuari Group was triggered in April 2013 when the latter bought about 10 per cent stake in MCFL through open market.
Later, Deepak Fertilisers acquired 24.46 per cent stake in MCFL in one-go in July 2013. After this, Zuari group had increased its stake to 16.43 per cent in the same month.
Mangalore Chemicals takeover battle got heated up again after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) cleared an open offer launched by Zuari Group firms on September 4. The CCI had cleared the open offer of Deepak Fertilisers on August 19.
Zuari Agro Chemicals had also entered into an agreement this year to use Mangalore Chemicals's facilities for contract production.
Also, MCFL in a BSE filing on October 1 said that the company had shut its urea plant due to expiry of permission given by the government for production of farm nutrient from high cost feedstock naptha.

Yahoo Movies Review: The ShaukeensCast: Anupam Kher, Piyush Mishra, Annu Kapoor, Lisa Haydon and Akshay Kumar
Director: Abhishek Sharma
Rating: *1/2
Sitting through a film like ‘The Shaukeens’ is a depressing experience. We see a lot of lousy writing but a film as banal as this one deserves a special call-out.
You would understand if amateurs were at work here, but the screenplay is by Tigmanshu Dhulia and actors of the calibre of Anupam Kher, Annu Kapoor and Piyush Mishra have agreed to do this film. You can’t expect a better replacement than them for the indomitable trio of Ashok Kumar, Utpal Dutt and AK Hangal who starred in the original ‘Shaukeen’ (1982). And yet, it boils down to one of the most blah outings at the theatres in recent times.
You are ready to account for some amount of sleaze when three lecherous old men, Lali (Kher), KD (Kapoor) and Pinky (Mishra) head to Mauritius for some adult fun. They rent a house that belongs to dusky diva Ahana Bhasin (Lisa Haydon), who is also an aspiring designer. Having met the marijuana-smoking wild child, our tharki (lusty) uncles are just waiting for a chance to score. There are bound to be misadventures and you expect them to be fun. However, what follows is an inane chain of events.
Just when you throw up your arms in despair, tired of the senior citizens gawking at young women and shamelessly looking for an opportunity to cajole the unsuspecting Ahana, Akshay Kumar makes an entry as the alcoholic superstar. While Khiladi Kumar tries to make fun of his “kind” of cinema, there is hardly any reprieve from the tepid humour of this shoddy affair.
Lisa Haydon’s sultry looks work their magic in the “Manali trance” number and when she dons the much-anticipated bikini; but she is saddled with such an unenthusiastic role that it saps the spunk out of her character. She does nothing but add a little to oomph to a terribly languid pace.
Cyrus Broacha as Akshay Kumar’s manager makes a futile attempt to amuse us. A National Award-winning Bengali director with an annoying accent makes another harebrained bid to tickle the funny bone. And then, it all collapses into a convenient lacklustre ending that is unconvincing and contrived.
It’s a shame that film after film reeks of uninspired writing and lazy filmmaking. Are we really this bereft of ideas that we can’t even replicate the success of a film that once worked?

Hindustan Motors offers VRS to employees
PTI
Tweet
Kolkata, Nov 9:  
The C K Birla owned Hindustan Motors Ltd, which was put under suspension of work since May 24 this year, today offered VRS to all its employees.
The VRS notice was pasted on the gates of the company’s Uttarpara unit by the management, which said all workers would be paid their statutory dues plus and additional amount of Rs 1 lakh each.
The VRS scheme would be applicable from today (November 9) till November 20, both days inclusive, the company said in a statement.
The Uttarpara unit of Hindustan Motors (HM) employed about 2,300 odd workers.
HM, which shot to limelight by manufacturing the iconic Ambassador car at its Uttarpara unit, faced troubled fortunes with declining sales of the vehicle over the years owing to onset of competition from Japanese and Korean auto makers.
Coupled with this, the unit was also facing severe cash crunch for which it was not being able to meet the working capital, leading to a situation where the company had to stop the production of Ambassador cars and effect a suspension of work notice at the Uttarpara unit.
A series of tripartite meetings which took place immediately after the suspension of work, yielded no result.
HM said in its statement that today’s decision was in line with the restructuring of the Uttarpara unit, which was announced earlier.

Fall in solar prices attributed to scale effect  industrys maturityFall in solar prices attributed to scale effect, industry’s maturity
M RAMESH
Solar companies predict prices to go further down
Chennai, November 9:  
Going by the results of the bids in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, solar prices seem to be stabilising at under Rs 7 a kWhr, not much higher than the prices of electricity produced with imported coal.
The lowest tariff in the Andhra Pradesh bid was Rs 6 a kWhr (adjusted for the 3 per cent annual hike), by the US company, First Solar. In Karnataka, the best bid was Rs 6.83 by SunEdison, another US solar major.
Compare this with the tariffs quoted in December 2011, in a bidding round of the National Solar Mission—most of the winning bidders quoted between Rs 8 and Rs 9 a kWhr.
Given that prices of raw materials have not fallen as much as to explain a Rs 2.5 fall in tariffs in less than three years, experts attribute the recent bid results to two factors—scale effect and industry’s maturity.
Prices are coming down because solar companies could set up larger projects. Under the National Solar Mission, no bidder could put up more than 50 MW, and again, not more than 20 MW at a single location. Now, Andhra Pradesh allowed 100 MW for a single bidder and Karnataka went as high as 500 MW. Economies of scale have helped.
Vivek Jayakumar, Executive Director of the Mumbai-based solar consultancy, Arbutus, sees among solar companies “a desire to corner a large market share, thereby commanding an ability to influence pricing from suppliers.” He also notes that some solar power developers are also manufacturers of solar equipment (First Solar, SunEdison).
Madhavan Nampoothiri, who runs RESolve Energy Consultants, feels that the prices are also due to the industry maturing. Solar developers now know better, for example, what to buy from whom and are able to enter into long-term supply agreements, hammering costs down. Welspun’s agreement with Bonfiglioli for inverters is an example. Solar companies know more about project execution and teething problems and consequently do not have to leave a cushion in the prices they quote for unknowns.
Will prices fall further?
India today has 2,765 MW of grid-connected solar power and power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed for another 1,900 MW. But a lot more is to come.
The government of India wants to create 15,000 MW more by 2018-19—the road map for 3,000 MW by 2016-17 is clear. Then there are state tenders being readied—Telangana (500 MW), Haryana and Uttarakhand (50 MW each) and Maharashtra (75 MW). Tamil Nadu has announced a feed-in tariff of Rs 7.01, and some stir-up in interest is in evidence.
The question is, where are the solar prices headed? There seems to be consensus among solar companies that there is room for prices to go down further. This will come from incremental improvement in the amount of sun’s energy converted into electricity, breakthroughs in technology (SunEdison recently announced one that will bring polysilicon prices low enough to chip off Re 1 from cost per kWhr of solar power), economies of scale and possible reduction in cost of finance.

Kerala set to become bio-agricultural by 2016Kerala set to become bio-agricultural by 2016
Our Bureau

Kochi, November 9:  
The Government has chalked out strategies to make Kerala into a bio-agricultural State by 2016, KP Mohanan, Minister for Agriculture has said.
Each panchayat will be given cash awards to become eco-friendly so that by 2016, the entire State would become bio-agricultural. Kerala will be the second State in the country to achieve this target, the Minister said at the valedictory session of the Global Agro meet.
According to him, Kerala has all the potential to attract large-scale investment, especially in agriculture and food processing sectors. The government is planning to introduce a single window scheme for the benefit of potential investors to avail licences to set up ventures in the sector without their physical presence.
The Minister pointed out that a major bane of the State is the near extinction of rich rice varieties, which were once common in Kerala. “This situation needs to be changed and we should once again start focusing on rice cultivation. Some of our own varieties even have medicinal values;” he said.
Citing the fall in prices of commodities as a major issue being faced by the sector, Kerala Governor P Sathasivam called for joint efforts by officials and politicians to change the situation by connecting farmers and consumers through specific schemes.

TN determined to raise Mullaperiyar dam height to 152 ft: CMTN determined to raise Mullaperiyar dam height to 152 ft: CM
Press Trust of India
Tweet
Chennai, November 9:  
Tamil Nadu government today asserted that while it was determined to increase the height of Mullaperiyar dam to 152 feet, it would also take all possible efforts to restrain Kerala government from constructing dams across Pambaru and Bhavani rivers.
“Since the water level in the dam is increasing following rains, the height of the dam can be increased only during the summer after the north-east monsoon. Tamil Nadu government is determined to increase the height to 152 ft,” Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said in a statement.
Panneerselvam said work towards increasing the height of the dam, in line with the direction of Supreme Court allowing it to increase storage to 142 ft, was discussed in detail with Kerala officials in September meeting.
He had written a letter to Prime Minister yesterday, after media reports suggested Kerala government’s plan to construct dams across Pambaru and Bhavani rivers, asking to intervene in the matter and stop construction of dams across the rivers without consulting Tamil Nadu.
Pambaru dam
“Tamil Nadu government would make every possible effort to stall any effort taken by the Kerala government to construct dams across Pambaru and Bhavani rivers,” Panneerselvam said.
Karunanidhi on Friday had expressed fears that Tamil Nadu could stand to lose a chance of implementing the Supreme Court order and sought urgent steps by AIADMK government.
Copious rains
Copious rains have ensured increase in the storage level even as discharge of water for drinking needs had been stepped up considerably as the storage had touched 138.10 ft.
“By unnecessarily discharging excess amount of water, Tamil Nadu could lose an opportunity to store water at 142 ft (as per the May 7, 2014 Supreme Court order),” he had stated.

Flipkart eyes $1.5 bn in another round of fu...Amazon
(The company has raised a…)
BENGALURU: India's largest online retailer, Flipkart, could begin another round of mega fund-raising as it expands its product range catering to a widening base of customers. The Bengaluru-based firm will seek funding of about $1.5 billion and has begun shortlisting potential investors, according to two people with direct knowledge of the developments. "Talks haven't begun yet and Flipkart is looking to target only a few investors that they want on board," said one of the two persons directly involved in the process. "The fund-raising process is expected to begin in January 2015."
Flipkart, when contacted, declined comment on its fund-raising and investment plans. The company has raised a total of $1.2 billion this year and has just completed a round of festival sales marked by steep discounts. "At the pace at which it is making investments, Flipkart will deploy most of the funds it has raised by around mid-next year," said the source.
Discounting still accounts for a chunk of Flipkart's monthly costs, with promotions costing it at least Rs 70 crore each month, according to a person who works with Flipkart at a strategic level.
The company has also identified very specific areas to pump in money to ensure its goal of doubling in size by next year.
Post the blockbuster festive season sales of October, when the company shipped around 80 lakh items versus 50 lakh on average, the company has revised its internal targets to reach sales of $4 billion by the end of the current fiscal, according to sources.
A major area of focus is increasing the categories in which they have leadership. "It has built a lead in fashion with the Myntra acquisition. The same push needs to happen across categories," said Manish Saigal , managing director at advisory firm Alvarez and Marsal.
"Furniture and packaged food will be launched very soon," said a person directly involved in the process. The teams are being built for these product categories.
Rival Amazon India recently launched its gourmet and specialty foods category with over 155 Indian and imported brands. Amazon is yet to launch furniture. Snapdeal, on the other hand, already has a presence in these segments.
"There are aggressive existing competitors and large offline players could come in very soon. It makes sense to extend its leadership now," said Arvind Singhal , chairman of retail advisory Technopak.
The seven-year-old company will launch a wider range of lifestyle products and consumer durables. It already has its range of tablets and digital accessories (Digiflip), apparel (Flippd) and home appliances and personal healthcare products such as sandwich makers and hair dryers (Citron).
According to a person directly involved with the process, Flipkart will put more marketing muscle behind in-house brands.
"We have seen how Myntra's inhouse brands have performed and scaled. That is what will be done with the new brands."
For Myntra, its portfolio of about 10 in-house brands accounts for about 20% of overall sales. Its biker brand Roadster is already a Rs 100-crore brand.
Flipkart's stake acquisition in consumer appliances service provider Jeeves Consumer Services should be seen in this light. "When they have their own brand of appliances, they will have to handle servicing, warranties and other such issues.
They can't do this all on their own," said one of the persons who spoke to ET on this matter. A Flipkart spokesperson said through this (strategic) partnership, Jeeves will provide exclusive value-added services in ecommerce to Flipkart customers across India.
"Flipkart and other marketplaces will have to invest humungous amounts into logistics and fulfilment if they want to cover even rural areas," said Technopak's Singhal. Flipkart has a delivery network of about 300 locations and is intending to expand its reach to even small towns.
In each of these areas, Flipkart is also looking at acquisitions.
When Flipkart appointed former Canaan Partners associate Nishant Verman as its M&A head earlier this year, its HR head Mekin Maheshwari said inorganic growth is a strong component of the vision to make Flipkart a $100-billion company. Snapdeal and Amazon have also made their intentions clear to acquire companies in areas ranging from mobile technology to payments.
"The over-arching theme will be acquisitions as they try to bridge existing gaps and scale up faster," said Alvarez and Marsal's Saigal.

Ferrari  Maserati revving up for a return to...Tweet
Maserati plans to open a national sales company in India and is in the process of appointing an eight-member team.
MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Ferrari and Maserati will soon have their marketing and sales setups in place in India, as their Italian-American parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) Group wants to bring back these marquee brands that offer big opportunities in a market where the number of superrich is fast expanding.
Maserati plans to open a national sales company in India and is in the process of appointing an eight-member team, say people with knowledge of the matter. After that, it would decide on a dealership and, according to current plans, will start selling cars from the second half of 2015.
Ferrari, which will manage its Indian operations from Dubai , is in discussions with Yadur Kapur , who is associated with Aston Martin , Lamborghini and Rolls Royce , to appoint him as its principal dealer in Delhi. In Mumbai, it is talking to Navnit Motors, which sells brands such as BMW, Land Rover , and Rolls Royce. The plan is to offer cars from the first quarter of 2015.
"A high-level Ferrari team was in India last month to finalise sales of its high-end cars with new dealers," a person close the matter said. People associated with Kapur and Navnit Motors confirmed the talks.
A spokesperson for the local unit of Fiat said as part of Maserati's growth strategy, the group is constantly evaluating market opportunities, including in India. "We consider India as one of the key growth markets for the automotive industry worldwide. While we can confirm that we are planning to enter the Indian market in the medium term, it is too early to confirm details in terms of structure, setup and cooperation with other FCA Group brands.
We will make an announcement as soon as possible," the spokesperson said in an email. In August, FCA India president and MD Nagesh Basavanhalli had said the parent wanted to bring the marquee brands to India.
The market for super luxury cars in India isn't in a good shape, primarily because of high import tax. Fully-built imported cars attract taxes and other levies totaling 170% on the original price making them too expensive for local buyers. Still, the growing club of rich Indians is giving confidence to luxury carmakers to bring their products here. And, India still is one of the largest markets in the Asia Oceania region for cars costing more than Rs 2 crore.
"India has emerged perhaps as one of the hottest destinations for super luxury carmakers, thanks to its rapidly increasing number of billionaires coupled with the expanding base of passionate drivers," says Amit Kaushik, principal analyst, autos, at consultancy firm IHS .
Ferrari is likely to bring its models such as the California T convertible, V-12 FF, 458 Italia, F12 Berlinetta, 458 Spider and the La Ferrari to India, say people with knowledge of the matter. These models cost between Rs 3.5 crore and Rs 7 crore in India after taxes. Ferrari and Maserati previously had marketing arrangements in India. In 2011, Fiat appointed the Shreyans Group as the official importer for Ferrari in India. They had a separate deal for handling the Maserati brand. The arrangements fell through with the end of the Ferrari franchise earlier this year. The Maserati deal was terminated in 2012-13.

By Duane D Stanford
ATLANTA: PepsiCo recently elevated three executives into bigger roles, marking the next wave of leadership at a company that has lost talent at the very top. Oswald Barckhahn, president of nutrition in North America; Laxman Narasimhan, CEO of foods in Latin America; and Mike Spanos, CEO of the greater China region, all were promoted in September.
While none of the executives is yet seen as a successor to CEO Indra Nooyi , the company is trying to replenish its talent pool after a number of high-level departures. The most recent loss came this week, when PepsiCo disclosed that president Zein Abdalla , who'd been considered a contender to succeed Nooyi, will retire at the end of the year.Barckhahn, who previously served as senior vice-president of Tropicana North America and general manager for Central Europe, is now responsible for Quaker, Gatorade, Tropicana and Naked Emerging Brands.
Narasimhan is now in charge of Pepsi-Co's food brands in Mexico, Brazil, Central and South America as well as the Caribbean , reporting directly to Nooyi.
Spanos, who's been with PepsiCo for about 20 years, now leads the company's food, beverages and dairy businesses in China. He most recently was senior VP and chief customer officer for PepsiCo North America Beverages. Abdalla, 56, managed Pepsi-Co's European unit before being named president in September 2012, one of the company's highest posts. CFO Hugh Johnston also is considered a potential successor to 59-year-old Nooyi, who became CEO in October 2006 and hasn't said how long she intends to continue.
PepsiCo has lost at least two other highprofile executives this year. Brian Cornell , who had run the company's Americas Foods unit, became discount retailer Target Corp.'s CEO in August. Debra A Crew , who was president of PepsiCo North America Nutrition , became president and chief commercial officer of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. last month. The world's largest snack maker and secondbiggest beverage maker didn't give a reason for Abdalla's decision, which was disclosed in a regulatory filing.

How young working couples can build wealth without compromising on lifestyles

( If your investment horizon…)
By Bindisha Sarang
Life can be carefree for young working couples. They have more money and not too many financial responsibilities. But they also have more ways to spend the money. Meet Visakhapatnam-based architect Ananth Domatoti, 31, and his wife Anita Patnaik, 30. They have a combined annual income of almost Rs 22 lakh, but are not able to save even 5% of that. "I struggle to keep my expenses under control," admits Ananth.
In Mumbai, Vishal Nalawade, 30, and his wife Shraddha, 29, are facing a different problem. They have good jobs, spend carefully and save 60% of their net income every month. Yet, their finances are not really going places. In fact, their entire savings of Rs 5 lakh is idling in a bank account, earning a piffling 4% even as inflation eats into its purchasing power. Financial planners would baulk at this. "It's not very smart to keep so much money in a savings bank account. A balance of Rs 1 lakh for emergencies is more than enough," says Mumbai-based financial planner Suresh Sadagopan.
Young working couples such as the Domatotis and the Nalawades are frittering away a terrific opportunity. If they are careful in the way they save, invest and spend their money, they can transform their financial future. Apart from high incomes and few financial responsibilities, these double-income couples have time on their side. With almost 25-30 years of working life ahead of them, they can amass a huge amount using the power of compounding.
This week's cover story looks at how young couples can capitalise on the advantages to build substantial wealth without compromising too much on their lifestyles. We look at the most common mistakes that young couples are likely to make and also list out the essential steps they must take in these formative years.
When you are young and earning well, savings and investing often take a back seat. The double-income comfort tricks many couples into thinking that their saving plans can be postponed by a few years. delaying investments can be a costly mistake because the investor loses out on the power of compounding. We all know that compounding can work wonders but here's an eye opener: If one starts saving Rs 5,000 a month at the age of 30 and earns 10% compounded returns, he would have Rs 1.13 crore at the age of 60. If he delays the investment by 10 years and starts at 40, he will manage to save only Rs 38 lakh. "The sooner you begin, the bigger is the corpus. Young couples should start putting away in the initial years itself," advises Pankaj Mathpal, a Mumbai-based financial planner.
Don't save, invest
Saving alone is not enough. The Nalawades have been saving for more than one year, but instead of growing, their money has shrunk in value in real terms. Wholesale inflation may be down but consumer inflation is still raging at around 7%. If you assume an inflation rate of 7%, the 4% return on their savings idling in the bank account actually means a loss of 3%.
"I am not very clued in to financial matters so could not decide where to invest," explains Vishal, almost embarrassed about the loss in purchasing power. For young investors like him, equity mutual funds should be the instrument of choice. Identifying a good fund is not rocket science. The couple should start investing a small amount in any five-star diversified equity fund.
If the Nalawades have not deployed their money because they lack knowledge, Bengaluru-based IT professionals Aditya Vajha and his wife Sonia Kakodkar have stayed away from equities because of their past experience with the asset class. They are not even 30 but have the risk profile that even a retiree would find too conservative.
  Understanding your risk profile is very important. Young people often make the mistake of taking too little risk even though they can withstand some volatility. If your investment horizon is more than 5-6 years, there is no reason why you should be investing in debt instruments that offer very low yields. The Domatotis are putting away their entire investible surplus in recurring deposits. They should consider equity funds which can give them better returns. Of course, they should do this in a graded manner.
This approach will especially be suitable for Vajha and Kakodkar, who have vowed to stay away from equities due to past losses. Instead of investing and saving for their other goals, they are aggressively paying down their home loan. Apart from the EMI of Rs 37,000, they put their entire monthly surplus of Rs 50,000 in a home saver account to prepay the home loan. "It's good to be debt free but in their bid to prepay their home loan they may be compromising their future," says Parag Paranjpe, a financial planner. At least Rs 10,000 should be diverted to an SIP in a good diversified equity fund. If they are still fearful, they could consider a balanced fund.

ICC warns teams against pull-outsMore
ICC warns against West Indies repeat
The WICB faces a claim for millions of dollars in damages from the BCCI and could still be suspended by the ICC, with the matter a subject of ongoing board meetings in Dubai.

The ICC has issued a warning against players taking contractual matters into their own hands, as West Indies did in withdrawing from their tour of India, and hinted that the right to play in domestic tournaments such as the IPL could be removed for those who transgress in future.
West Indies effectively cancelled their commitments in India last month due to a dispute between the WICB, the West Indies Players' Association (WIPA) and the players themselves. The WICB faces a claim for millions of dollars in damages from the BCCI and could still be suspended by the ICC, with the matter a subject of ongoing board meetings in Dubai.

The ICC, which has previously stated it cannot intervene in disputes over bilateral series unless it receives a complaint, said that players abandoning tours had the potential to cause "irrevocable damage" that could "adversely affect the financial viability of the sport itself".
The statement continued: "Players who behave in a similar manner in the future will not only risk breaching the disciplinary rules of the relevant member board and being sanctioned accordingly, but may also put in jeopardy their ability to conclude future contractual arrangements with domestic franchises or clubs in other jurisdictions."
Several West Indies players, including the ODI captain, Dwayne Bravo , who was at the forefront of the dispute with WIPA, are regular participants in the IPL, although it has previously been suggested that their eligibility would not be affected by the walkout.
The ICC's chairman, N Srinivasan, said: "It was undoubtedly a sad chapter in our sport. It damaged cricket's integrity and reputation, as well as affecting confidence within the cricket community, especially that of the fans. The ICC board was determined to address this situation and ensure such incidents never happen again. The ICC is working with the concerned members towards finding a positive resolution and is confident that there will be constructive outcomes for our game."
West Indies' decision led to one ODI, one T20 and three Tests being cancelled and the BCCI submitting a claim for $42m in damages. The India board has also suspended bilateral relations with the WICB and threatened it with legal action if its demands are not met.

25 years later  Germany marks the fall that changed the worldPrint
By: Associated Press | Berlin | Posted: November 9, 2014 4:28 am | Updated: November 9, 2014 1:18 pm
Germany on Sunday celebrates the 25th anniversary of the night the Berlin Wall fell, a pivotal moment in the collapse of communism and the start of the country’s emergence as the major power at the heart of Europe.
A 15-km chain of lighted balloons along the former border will be released into the air Sunday evening — around the time on November 9, 1989 when a garbled announcement by a communist official set off the chain of events that brought down the Cold War’s most potent symbol.
The opening of East Germany’s fortified frontier capped months of ferment across eastern and central Europe that had already ushered in Poland’s first post-communist prime minister and prompted Hungary to cut open its border fence. The hard-line leadership in East Berlin faced mounting pressure from huge protests and an exodus of citizens via other communist countries.
The collapse of the Wall, which had divided the city for 28 years, was “a point of no return … from there, things headed toward a whole new world order”, said Axel Klausmeier, the director of the city’s main Wall memorial.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, is opening an overhauled museum Sunday at the site — home to one of few surviving sections of the Wall. Merkel, 60, recalls the feeling of being stuck behind East Germany’s border.
“Even today when I walk through the Brandenburg Gate, there’s a residual feeling that this wasn’t possible for many years of my life, and that I had to wait 35 years to have this feeling of freedom,” Merkel said last week. “That changed my life.”
The future chancellor was among the thousands who poured westward hours after the ruling Politburo’s spokesman, Guenter Schabowski, off-handedly announced at a televised news conference that East Germans would be allowed to travel to West Germany and West Berlin.
Soon, Western media were reporting that East Germany was opening the border and East Berliners were jamming the first crossing.
Border guards had received no orders to let anyone cross, but gave up trying to hold back the crowds. By midnight, all the border crossings in the city were open.
East Germany’s then-leader, Egon Krenz, later said the plan was to allow free travel only the next morning so citizens could line up properly to get exit visas.
Since then, some 1.5 to 2 trillion euros has gone into rebuilding the once-dilapidated east.
Much has changed beyond recognition, though some inequalities persist. But the progress toward true unity is seen in Germany’s top leadership: Not only is Merkel from the east, but so is the nation’s president, Joachim Gauck, a former Protestant pastor and pro-democracy activist.
Germans today can be grateful to have lives and opportunities, Gauck said, “that endless numbers of people in the world can only desire and dream of”.

TOPICS
social issue
It seemed the protest would end without so much as a public hug but, the "kiss of love" campaigners surprised everyone with a display of affection leaving behind some iconic images of a new daring.
They were outnumbered, subjected to vituperative attacks online and offline and their leaders put under preventive arrest, but the small group of youngsters who took upon themselves the daunting task of interrogating the deeply entrenched intolerance towards any public display of affection, pulled off an unlikely victory on November 2.
Amid heckling by ultraconservative sections of the Hindu and Muslim right and harassment by the police, nearly 100 youngsters hugged and kissed in public at the Marine Drive in Kochi to declare to the whole world that they are here to challenge moral fascism and moral policing.
At a factual level, theirs was a protest against Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) activists’ act of vandalism against a restaurant in Kozhikode on the argument that young boys and girls are frequenting it to hug and kiss. The resistance group organised themselves into a Facebook group called “Kiss of Love Community” and urged everyone who believed in the freedom for public display of affection to join them in the protest. The call evoked an overwhelming response on the Facebook page and, on the day of the demonstration, nearly 100 of them turned up at the Marine Drive.
Waiting for them were thousands of activists of Shiv Sena, Bajrang Dal and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and conservative Muslim political outfits such the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and the Sunni Yuvajana Sanghom (SYS), besides district-level workers of the Kerala Students’ Union (KSU), the student wing of the Congress. They shared a common slogan: to save Kerala from “western influence,” and were menacing in their slogans and demeanour, ready to pounce on anyone who dared to indulge in public display of affection. They did beat up some youth, but it turned out that this bunch, dressed in western clothing, were out there to protect “Indian culture”! Then came the arrests. As the events at the Marine Drive unfolded, a post on the “Kiss of Love” campaign Facebook page read: “Love is put behind bars while hatred roams freely.”
For a moment, it seemed the protest would end without so much as a public hug but, even as they were being carted away by the police, a few scores of the “Kiss of Love” campaigners surprised everyone with a brave display of affection, hugging and kissing each other, leaving behind some iconic images of a new daring. The event had its resonance in the University of Hyderabad the same day and in Kolkata and Mumbai a few days later, suggesting that moral fascism transcends regional boundaries in India today. For Kerala, however, the protest had a special relevance and meaning, given the State’s reputation of being a modern, educated and progressive society. What the youngsters did was to rip open the façade of modernity and progressivism that hide behind its deeply regressive attitude towards human relationships in public and private spaces.
Wrote J. Devika, leading feminist scholar: “While the Hindutva groups and the conservative constituencies of other religions in Kerala may advance different arguments to justify their loathing of public physical expressions of warmth, the unity they have achieved in their irrational fear of public touch needs to be considered further … I think this event also rubbishes a whole lot of hogwash that plagues one’s ears in contemporary Kerala about how the youth are incapable of doing anything significant, how they keep consuming and turning into crap … ”
The State has been witnessing a rising tide of moral policing in recent times with vigilante groups of both the Left and Right and the majority and minority communities taking upon themselves the job of policing neighbourhoods, harassing men and women and running campaigns of calumny against chosen targets. This is nothing short of an anomalous situation given the State’s long history of progressive social interventions, astounding material progress post-1970s and Malayalis’ exposure to life and culture in other shores.
Creature comforts and gadgetry available to Malayalis are the envy of many elsewhere and the tapestry of visual and aural experiences that have washed ashore with the changing times have added rich hues to the aspirations and life possibilities of every Malayali. But, some 150 years after women of the subaltern communities of former Travancore fought and won the right to cover their breasts after brutal repressions, the State is witnessing attempts at re-tethering to the patriarchal positions that Kerala society has been trying to shake free from. The attack on the restaurant in Kozhikode and the violent response to the “Kiss of Love” campaign were a testimony to this.
What the youngsters achieved, braving heavy odds, was to lay bare all that and trigger a debate in Kerala on the patriarchal attitudes and decadent orthodoxy that have been the hallmark of public — and also private — life in Kerala. One refreshing development was the support extended to their protest by Left parties, particularly the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and the ambivalent stand taken by the rest of the political mainstream.
“More than moral policing, at issue here is the conflict between patriarchy and the desire to bring down all that goes with it. I think those who organised this struggle have a weighty responsibility to keep up the spirit and use the energies they have unleashed to take Kerala society forward on a healthy path,” says veteran journalist and rights activist B.R.P. Bhaskar. For a State that has lived under a coalitional gridlock that has largely benefited mostly patriarchal and commercial vested interests and which seems at the cusp of further political churning, the “Kiss of Love” campaign could just be the opening up of new possibilities of forward movement as well as resistance.

Kerala’s Ashtamudi lake gets recognition for sustainable clam fishing

Ashtamudi lake, a Ramsar wetland of international importance, is the second largest estuarine system in Kerala and the clam fishery began in 1981.
Union Minister of State for Environment Prakash Javadekar on Friday announced that the Clam Governing Council of Ashtamudi lake in Kerala was the first Marine Stewardship Council-certified fishery in India.
Speaking at a press conference, he said that the fisherfolk decided to go in for sustainable activities after they extracted over 10,000 tonne clams from the lake, reducing its capacity over the years. This was the first such certification for India, he pointed out.
The Ashtamudi Estuary showcases to the world that development and environment protection go hand in hand and participatory approach at the local level in managing biodiversity is an important aspect of it, an official statement said. This achievement also opens up the scope for other fisheries in India to work towards MSC certification, which would enhance conservation and sustainability of the resource, while providing greater economic returns. The MSC is an international non-profit organisation set up to help transform the seafood market to a sustainable basis. The MSC runs the only certification and eco-labeling programme for wild-capture fisheries. Ashtamudi short neck clam fishery is only the third fishery in Asia to have received the recognition, the statement added.
Ashtamudi lake, a Ramsar wetland of international importance, is the second largest estuarine system in Kerala and the clam fishery began in 1981. It supports the livelihoods of around 3000 fisherfolk involved in collection, cleaning processing and trading clams. The growth of Ashtamudi’s commercial fishery was driven by demand from Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1980s and the 1990s. By 1991, the catch peaked at 10,000 tonne a year, but declined by 50 per cent in 1993 due to overfishing.
Faced with the prospect of dwindling catch, the community decided to restrict fishing and impose mesh size restrictions for nets, along with a minimum export size and a prohibition on mechanical clam fishing, the official statement added. These measures showed immediate effects, and clam fishery has sustained landings of around 10,000 tonne a year for the past decade.

Chinas trade surplus on rise as exports fare betterUpdated: November 8, 2014 20:35 IST
China’s trade surplus on rise as exports fare better

China’s exports rose 11.6 per cent while its imports increased by 4.6 per cent year on year in October as it recorded a better—than—expected trade surplus of USD 45.41 billion, boosting the country’s bid to contain slowdown of the world’s second largest economy.
The jump in exports by 11.6 per cent last month was slower than the 15.3 per cent rise in September, which was the fastest growth rate in 19 months, according to the official figures released here today.
Imports in October stood at USD 161.46 billion, up 4.6 per cent. Total exports and imports rose by 8.4 per cent to USD 368.33 billion, as trade surplus expanded to USD 45. 41 billion up 46.3 per cent, exceeding market expectations for a USD 42.3 billion surplus, according to a survey by Wall Street Journal.
“Imports and exports in October have both extended a growth trend from the previous month,” the General Administration of Customs said in a statement.
The good news for China is that its trade surplus continue to rise, which could enable it to aggressively address the slowdown with structural reforms.
In the first ten months of this year, China’s total exports and imports hit USD 3.53 trillion, up 3.8 per cent.
Trade surplus during the period stood at USD 277.11 billion, up 38.5 per cent year on year.
China has the largest foreign exchange reserves of USD four trillion and its GDP expanded 7.3 per cent from a year ago in the third quarter, compared with 7.5 per cent in the second quarter and 7.4 per cent in the first quarter of this year, official data showed.
According to forecasts China may miss the official GDP target of 7.5 per cent this year.
China’s growth continues to slowdown, reflecting policy efforts to rebalance the economy as the country works to implement reforms supporting more sustainable growth, the World Bank’s China Economic Update said.
According to the new trade data, during the Jan —Oct period, trade with the European Union, China’s largest trading partner, saw the fastest growth of 9.8 per cent, amounting to 3.12 trillion yuan.
Trade with the US, China’s second—largest trading partner, stood at 2.78 trillion yuan, up 5.5 per cent.
China—ASEAN trade went up 7.4 per cent to 2.4 trillion yuan.
Exports including machinery, garments, textiles, shoes, toys, plastics rose during the first ten months, while exports of electronic products, home furniture and vehicles fell, state—run Xinhua news agency reported.

"Is the BJP ready to accept support from NCP, which supported the likes of Ishrat Jahan?"
Hours after the Union Council of Ministers was expanded on Sunday, a slighted Shiv Sena, which has been refused a Cabinet berth, declared it would sit in the opposition if the newly elected Bharatiya Janata Party-led minority government in Maharashtra sought the support of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to survive the trust vote on Wednesday.
The Sena will vote against the new government in the State if the BJP accepted support from the NCP, an anti-Hindutva party, party chief Uddav Thackeray told presspersons after a long huddle with Sena MLAs.
“How can you take support from [NCP chief] Sharad Pawar, who was the first to use words such as saffron terrorism? Is the BJP ready to accept support from the NCP, which supported the likes of Ishrat Jahan? If the BJP is ready to accept support from the NCP,” Mr. Thackeray said, “the Sena will sit in the opposition and vote against the BJP government in Maharashtra for the sake of Hindutva.”
However, he refused to say if the Sena would withdraw Anant Geete from the one slot that the Sena has in the Union Cabinet, continuing to keep the doors open for a rapprochement with the BJP.
“I will decide at the right time,” was all he said.
Last week, Mr. Pawar declared that if need be, his party would vote for the trust motion to be moved by the State’s first ever BJP Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis.
The announcement by Mr. Pawar, whose party has 41 MLAs, has weakened the bargaining power of the Sena, which has 63.

CCI is also protecting consumer rightsTweet
SUBODH PRASAD DEO, former Additional Director General, CCI
Not just focussed on anti-competitive practices, the CCI is increasingly looking into whether such practices harm consumer interest, says the former Additional Director General, CCI
Maulik Tewari
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been making headlines with its orders against companies indulging in anti-competitive behaviour.
In an email interview with BusinessLine, Subodh Prasad Deo, Partner, Saikrishna & Associates and former Additional Director General, CCI, explains what the CCI means to consumers and the challenges the regulator faces. Edited excerpts:
The CCI is turning out to be the de facto protector of consumer rights in the country in the absence of any other specific regulator. Your comment on this.
It is true that the CCI has addressed the issue of protecting consumer rights in various orders. It seems that while it adopts the classical competition standard in most cases (examining whether the conduct restricts competition), it is, at the same time, not averse to adopting the consumer welfare standard (examining whether the conduct harms consumer interest by, say, higher prices or reduced choices).
The CCI’s orders in the DLF case or the Hiranandani Hospital case are predicated on the notion of consumer harm, rather than on harm to the process of competition.
The legal architecture of the Competition Act 2002 limits the scope for the CCI to address the concerns of consumers directly. Accordingly, it has closed several complaints by home buyers against builders, despite holding in general, and not determinatively, in such cases that the conduct of the builders was unfair and exploitative.
 How is the role of the CCI different from that of Consumer Courts?
Competition concerns arise in the context of business to business (B2B) dealings rather than in business to consumer (B2C) dealings, even though consumers are generally the ultimate victims of anti-competitive conduct. The CCI is mandated to address competition concerns by regulating the conduct in B2B dealings, which thereby benefit consumers. In contrast, consumer courts address consumer issues directly by settling disputes between business and consumer. The two also differ in terms of the process, procedures and evidentiary standards; the former is a regulator whereas the latter is a judicial body.
What challenges are faced by the CCI in investigating cartel cases?
Cartel cases involve unravelling of the ‘agreement’ between the parties that have allegedly indulged in anti-competitive conduct. Cartel conduct is obviously very secretive and the parties take care not to leave behind any evidence.
Meeting the legal threshold even for the ‘preponderance of probability’ standard (that is, given the facts of the case a cartel is more likely than not) is many a time difficult for want of coherent circumstantial evidence. A dogged pursuit of the suspected parties for a longer period of time may be a way out.
The use of leniency provisions (where one of the cartel members provides information in return for full or partial immunity from fines) could also yield results. But such provisions would work only if there is a credible possibility of detection, prosecution and penalties.
An investigation into a case starts with defining the ‘relevant market’. In the DLF case, the CCI has been criticised for defining the relevant market too narrowly. What are your views on that?
Defining the relevant market properly is indeed the key in many cases.
While the CCI is actively engaged in developing capacities of its officials, all investigators are drawn from various government departments for a specified period. There is a need to provide for permanency for a certain percentage of investigators. Non-availability or non-reliability of market data too impinges on the definition of the relevant market.
How long does a typical investigation take? Does the CCI have the resources to handle all cases? 
Typically, an investigation takes nine to 12 months but this could vary depending upon the complexity of cases. While the CCI is trying its best to ensure timely completion of investigation, more skilled personnel would definitely help.

From Gujarat to Centre: Adhia replaces Sandhu as financial services secretaryHasmukh Adhia
By: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi/ahmedabad | Posted: November 4, 2014 3:49 am
In another round of top-level changes in the finance ministry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appointed Gujarat cadre IAS officer Hasmukh Adhia as secretary, department of financial services.
A 1981 batch officer, Adhia will replace incumbent Gurdial Singh Sandhu, who has been now been posted as secretary, National Authority for Chemical Weapons Convention. “The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved the appointment of Hasmukh Adhia, at present in the cadre, as secretary, department of financial services, ministry of finance vice Gurdial Singh Sandhu on his relinquishing the charge of the post,” said an official statement on Monday. The announcement was surprising as Sandhu was slated to meet chiefs of public sector banks on Wednesday, for which the finance ministry had also sent an invitation for coverage.
This is the latest in a series of changes in North Block — ahead of the Union Budget 2015-16 — including the transfer of former finance secretary Arvind Mayaram to the ministry of minority affairs and the appointment of former Rajasthan chief secretary Rajiv Mehrishi as secretary, department of economic affairs.
Adhia, who was a close aide to Modi in Gujarat, was expected to get a key posting in New Delhi for quite some time. At present, he is posted as principal secretary, finance, in Gujarat but he had served as additional principal secretary (2003-04) and later as principal secretary (2004-06) to Modi, when he was chief minister Gujarat. Previously, he had also worked as deputy secretary and director in the department of commerce at the Centre between 1994 and 1999.
A member of the board of governors of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, Adhia holds a Ph.D. in Yoga from Swami Vivekanand Yoga University, Bangalore — for which he had taken a sabbatical from his job. Credited as the man behind the innovations and reforms during the Modi regime, he started annual ‘thought camp’ or ‘chintan shibir’ for IAS officers. He was also the executor of the ideas like the teachers and children’s universities during his stint with the state education department. Meanwhile, in separate appointments, Anjuly Chib Duggal, additional secretary in the department of expenditure was promoted to special secretary in the same department. Vivek Joshi, joint secretary in the ministry of women and child development has been posted as officer-on-special- duty procurement policy division in the department of expenditure in the place of Meena Agarwal.
Annie George Mathew, an officer of the Indian Audits and Accounts Service has also been posted as joint secretary in the department of expenditure in the place of incumbent Sudha Krishnan.

Debt recast loophole: Promoter paychecks come under scannerPrint
Written by Priyadarshi Siddhanta | New Delhi | Posted: November 4, 2014 3:45 am
The government is considering a probe on how banks allowed promoters of highly leveraged companies to draw salaries in crores when their companies were not repaying the debt. In fact, what has peeved the government most is that private and foreign banks made bilateral settlements with companies while public sector banks remained passive.
In a note that analyses the drawbacks of the current corporate debt restructuring (CDR) mechanism circulated to all ministries on October 29, and even to investigating agencies, the finance ministry said, “Promoters did not take any cut in salaries. But the banks ended up making huge sacrifices. There should be a formula of sacrifice they (promoters) have to make.”
Hence, it sought a closer monitoring of the CDR schemes either by the Reserve Bank of India or the ministry of finance.
After a due diligence, the government has found that as on December 31, 2013, the exchequer has incurred an aggregate debt of Rs 2,89,398 crore because of the CDR packages of which nearly Rs 30,000 crore is owing to their failure in cases of 115 companies.
Concerned that the CDR packages may have been manipulated by the companies to their own benefits, the government is planning to order an inquiry into it. “We should know why the CDR did not work in chunk of the cases. There is need for a probe into the entire issue,” a source in the government told The Indian Express.
The finance ministry has said that promoters have repeatedly got away in CDR packages with very little sacrifice. “The principle of all stakeholders taking a haircut has to be enforced,” the finance ministry has argued.
Asking for strengthening of the debt restructuring mechanism, the finance ministry has decided to ask all banks and financial institutions to mandatorily participate in CDR reviews.
Once a package has been approved, those exiting should be penalised, according to the note. “Bilateral deals between the lender and borrower after the CDR package should be frowned upon. Monitoring of this mechanism should be done at a very senior level either by the RBI or the government,” the note said. The problem has compounded because of an inefficient debt recovery tribunal (DRT) system as cases are getting unduly delayed, which needs a thorough review, the finance ministry said.
CDR should provide for ballooning of interest so that during the period of reconstruction, the interest burden is lower and after restoration of an enterprise, normal rates are charged. Also innovative measures like allowing external commercial borrowings to the banks and financial institutions for this purpose can be considered, the ministry suggested.
The CDR schemes were drawn up by the finance ministry and the RBI provide that the borrower could approach the CDR cell in the Industrial Development Bank of India and if 75 per cent of lenders agreed to the package then it would be binding on the rest.

Proof of life certificate: Govt plans digital verification to ease pensioners woesPrint
Written by Subhomoy Bhattacharjee | New Delhi | Posted: November 4, 2014 3:54 am
Millions of retired people could soon be spared the trouble of travelling to banks and post offices to prove they are alive to claim pensions. The government is working on a scheme for digital verification of pensioners.
“We are developing the means to allow pensioners to prove they are alive by a combination of Aadhaar numbers allied to a software tool that can be used from anywhere”, RS Sharma, secretary, department of information technology, told The Indian Express.
Current rules mandate that any person who draws a pension from her employer has to submit a proof every year that she is alive. While there are several alternative form of certificates that banks and post offices accept (11 types for government pension), in all cases they have to be presented by the person who draws the pension to the office from where the monthly payment is made. This applies for spouse to draw family pension, too. The few exceptions are for certified cases of ill health or permanent disability but here too the onus is on the disbursing agency to assure the person is alive.
This is also one of the reasons why government departments wed their pensioners to a single branch of a bank or a post office as the verification records are maintained by that office in physical documents. In February 2013 the department of expenditure relaxed the rules to allow pensioners to hand over their certificates to any branch of the bank which handles her pension account.
Once the alternative system is in place, it is expected to be extended to the pension market for unorganised sector in India too.
Gautam Bhardwaj, managing director, Invest India Micro Pension Services agreed that pension companies in this sector would need this support. “They have not worked out anything so far, but an Aadhaar based application would be essential, I expect”, he said.
The new system will be a joint effort of the finance ministry and the department of information technology. It will allow people to seed their pension accounts with Aadhaar numbers and on top of that build in an additional level of verification using a touch application to demonstrate the person is alive.
Sharma said the scheme has been flagged with the Prime Minister’s Office.
The size of the pension market is expanding fast in India. A Ficci-KPMG report has estimated the potential size of the pension market in India to close to Rs 4,00,000 crore by 2025.

New wilful defaulter law put on the back burnerFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
A more stringent law on wilful defaulters, a plan contemplated by the previous UPA government, is not high on the agenda of the Narendra Modi dispensation, which, instead, would now focus on ways to ensure that lenders get possession of the defaulters’ property quickly enough to stem value erosion.
Sources told FE that the government has decided to amend the Sarfaesi Act and the law on Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRT) to help the lenders lay their hands on the defaulters’ assets more expeditiously than now.
While the overall approach to tackle wilful defaulting is being discussed within the finance ministry, it has also sought the Reserve Bank’s (RBI)  opinion on whether there is at all a need for a separate legislation and separate courts with contempt powers to handle wilful defaulters.
The sources added that even if a new legislation to handle wilful defaulters is brought, which could have provisions for huge penalties, there are few takers in the ministry for an earlier plan to impose jail terms on them.
The ministry feels the RBI Master Circular on defaulters, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, recovery laws such as the Sarfaesi Act, DRT as well as the Indian criminal and civil laws are more than enough to handle all types of defaulters.  According to feedback received from lenders, putting defaulter business persons behind bars and imposing hefty fines on defaulters might have a deterrent effect, but will not actually serve the purpose of recovering unpaid dues, the sources said.
Those against a new wilful defaulter law also feel that a stringent wilful defaulter law will only scare away genuine entrepreneurs and business persons, who will fear that they might get the rough end of the stick in times of economic slowdown, during which many suffer due to cash-flow problems. Therefore, it is better to focus on reviving the economy that will in turn help business persons repay loans promptly, they said.
Expediting the process of enactment of a bankruptcy law will also ensure that India Inc can easily exit non-viable businesses so that the assets can either be sold off or put back to use quickly, they added.
“A new law will definitely take time. Meanwhile, we will soon try to amend Sarfaesi law and the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act (under which the DRTs have been set up),” a highly placed official told FE.
According to a finance ministry official, “The proposed wilful defaulter law is not a priority now. We have asked the RBI for its comments on whether a separate law is needed at all. Banks are only keen on recovery and not more litigation and delays. Besides, defaulters may be committing economic offences and may even have genuine difficulties in running their businesses, but hardly any of them are siphoning off bank money for acts such as drug trafficking, illegal arms trade and terrorism.”
The finance ministry has asked all the state governments to ensure that district magistrates (DMs) help lenders in taking possession of the property in a time-bound manner. The ministry has said that if DMs are still not prompt in helping the lenders, it might bring in amendments to the Sarfaesi law to ensure time-bound possession and transfer of property to lenders.
Observing delays in DRT due to several adjournments, the ministry is also considering amendments to the concerned legislation to ensure that the parties asking for a stay order from the DRT should first deposit a certain amount with the lender. The government will also soon increase the number of DRT benches and appoint more officials in DRTs.

Offline retailers in apparel  lifestyle rue losing festival sales to online playersFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Discounts offered by online marketplaces like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal this festive season have taken a toll on the business proceeds of their brick-and-mortar counterparts, especially in the apparel and lifestyle segments. Several store managers of popular apparel brands like Arrow, Allen Solly, Pepe Jeans and Indian Terrain FE spoke to rued that their Diwali business has taken a hit due to a surge in popularity of online stores, thanks to the discounts.
For instance, the store manager at an Allen Solly outlet on a plush Bangalore locality said on the condition of anonymity that the store sold products worth Rs 14 lakh in the two weeks leading to Diwali against Rs 18 lakh in the corresponding period last year.
“We have witnessed a slump in business this Diwali. Customers want discounts, even on fresh stocks, pampered by e-commerce discounts. We can’t afford that,” the manager said.
The store manager at Indian Terrain concurred. “We did a business of Rs 26 lakh last Diwali.This year, we did only Rs 19 lakh. An internal survey of our stores have shown such a slump in most places. This, despite running promotions and discounts for end of season sale. Customers don’t always understand that the products available online and different from those available in the stores. These are fresh products which usually comes once in six months,” the manager said.
The backlash from retailers has, for the time being, prompted e-tailers to withdraw direct discounts. However, e-tailers have promotional coupons that are equivalent to discount. For instance, on Flipkart, no discount is offered on Van Heusen shirts priced at Rs 1,899. But a promotional coupon offering a discount of 32% on all purchases over Rs 1,799 reduces the price of the product to Rs 1,291.
In a bid to give some relief to the brick-and-mortar stores, manufacturers had recently shot off letters to e-tailers, threatening to stop supply if the discounts were not withdrawn. “We have a written agreement stating that they need our approval before putting products on discount, which they did not adhere to. The letter had an effect. But e-commerce is going to grow. The best way is to offer non-competing products to the online and offline channels,” said Woodland India managing director Harkirat Singh.
In the electronics segment, it has,  however, emerged that in some cases brick-and-mortar stores offered better deals to customers looking for a discount. According to a survey by gadget research site 91mobiles.com, brick-and-mortar retailers are neck and neck with e-tailers when it comes to offering competitive prices. The survey, which took into account 30 popular phone models, suggests that some of the popular models are priced a meagre 5-8% cheaper in online stores.
For instance, iPhone 5S, which costs anything between Rs 35,000 and Rs 41,000 in brick-and-mortar stores, was available at Rs 34,000 on Flipkart, a mere 3% additional discount. The same phone was available at Rs 37,789 on Amazon and Rs 36,650 on Snapdeal. Again, an HTC Desire 516, available at anything between Rs 11,999 and Rs 13,000 in brick-and-mortar stores, was being sold at Rs 10,890 on Amazon and Rs 10,836 on Snapdeal while Flipkart priced it at Rs 11,700. A Sony Experia M, priced at Rs 9,700-Rs 10,500 in physical stores, was available for Rs 9,557 on Amazon, a mere 1% discount.
“This kind of sale at lower than cost price is discontinuous disruption and is against all fair practices of trade. This is creating chaos in the whole distribution network and has resulted in loss of sales for companies and downtrading happens in the market,” Himanshu Chakrawarti, CEO of The Mobile Store, told FE. The company has its own online platform that generates roughly 8% of its revenues.
According to Chakrawarti, while e-commerce firms get foreign direct investment (FDI) to indulge in “predatory pricing”, the rule clearly says FDI is disallowed in the sector.
“This brings in lack of transparency and regulation about the way the business is carried out. FDI is clearly funding this subsidisation of consumers. We are asking for a level playing field. Let the government change the law of land and make FDI permissible in e-commerce.”

After 118% cost overrun  OPaL in final talks with foreign players to sell 26%FPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
ONGC Petro additions (OPaL), a petrochemical project at Dahej promoted by ONGC, GAIL and GSPC, has seen its cost rise to Rs 27,100 crore, up 118% from the initial estimate of Rs 12,440 crore, owing mainly to delays caused by the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors.
To make up for the fund shortfall, the promoters are likely to announce a foreign equity partner for a 26% stake in the project by as early as December, sources privy to the matter told FE.
“Talks for equity participation with a foreign company are in the last phase. The announcement may be made in the next 30-45 days,” said one of the officials directly involved with the discussions. He did not divulge the name of the foreign players talking to OPaL promoters.
In January, ONGC had signed an initial agreement with Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) for “broad cooperation” by which the West Asian firm could buy a stake in OPaL.
OPaL is now set to achieve mechanical completion by March next year while commercial production would kick off by June 2015, the official added.
This is not the first time OPaL’s costs have gone up. The initial estimated investment of Rs 12,440 crore was first revised upwards to Rs 15,870 crore in 2008, further to Rs 19,535 crore in 2010 and again to Rs 21,396 crore last year. The new estimate of Rs 27,100 crore is yet to be approved by the ONGC board.
After taking over, minister of state (independent charge) for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan had directed ONGC to complete OPaL and ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals (OMPL) on top priority.
The project has raised debt to the tune of Rs 14,000 crore. ONGC holds a 26% stake in the project while GSPC has 5% and GAIL has 19% in the project. The joint venture partners are looking to sell the remaining stake to strategic investors.
The official said the cracker has already been commissioned. Other utilities related to power and water supplies are also being commissioned.
The rise in cost may also lead to a rejig in the equity participation by ONGC’s partners GAIL and GSPC. For instance, the GAIL board approved an investment of Rs 996.28 crore at inception, which, at the revised cost,  would fetch a lower stake.
OPaL is setting up a grassroots mega petrochemical project at Dahej in Gujarat. The complex’s main dual-feed cracker unit will have the capacity to produce 1,100 kilo-tonnes per annum (ktpa) ethylene and 400 ktpa propylene, and the associated units consist of a pyrolysis gasoline hydrogenation unit, a butadiene extraction unit and a benzene extraction unit.
OPaL aims to export products overseas to countries such as Africa, China, Singapore, Turkey, Pakistan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

Ambush marketing gets new spin as social media risesWhen Apple launched its iPhone 6 models and there were reports of its phones getting bent in back pockets, rivals were quick to cash in on a snowballing situation.
New Delhi | Posted: November 4, 2014 4:49 pm | Updated: November 4, 2014 4:53 pm
Year 2014 could well be labeled as the year of the gatecrashers. In March this year, PepsiCo trumped arch rival Coca-Cola as the soft drink sponsor on the marquee star studded television property, the Oscars. But the Coca-Cola logo was still seen on three pizza boxes delivered to A-listers who were a part of the awards ceremony. It all began when talk show hostess Ellen DeGeneres joked about the growing hunger of attendees during the awards and ultimately brought out three pizzas from Los-Angeles based pizzeria Big Mama\’s & Papa\’s. To cut a long story short, the pizzeria happened to be a long standing customer of Coca-Cola. The same night, DeGeneres tweeted from her Apple iPhone, even while Samsung was the official sponsor. The Korean handset maker had reportedly paid television network ABC $18 million for five minutes of prime time ads, plus product placement during broadcast.
The word “ambush” means an attack. Most often, it comes from a concealed position and via a cloak and dagger strategy. While earlier ambush marketing was mostly associated with cola companies, bike and soap manufacturers, this year has seen some major duels between the e-commerce giants. Some brick-and-mortar retailers have also had to get into the ring, propelled by the aggressiveness of the e-commerce brands. When India\’s e-commerce posterboy Flipkart came out with the ambitious “Big Billion Day”on October 6 promising customers never-before deals, discounts and surprise gifts across more than 70 categories of products, its full page ads said, “Today, don’t look anywhere else. India’s greatest sale ever is here.” To which, rival Snapdeal was quick to respond, “For others, it’s a big day. For us, it is no different.” E-commerce giant Amazon adopted a smart marketing technique where, when users typed http://www.bigbillionday.com , they landed on the Amazon home page instead of Flipkart. Amit Agarwal, country head and vice president at Amazon India however said that they did not buy the referenced address.
In addition, Amazon.in hijacked Flipkart’s sales blitz for ‘Big Billion Day’ by launching ‘Mission to Mars’ shopping weekend during October 4-6. It also celebrated the Diwali Dhamaka Week during October 10-16  and Dhanteras Dhamaka during 21 October which again gave great offers and deals. “The response from customers on the first day of the Diwali Dhamaka Week went beyond our wildest expectations. Traffic on that day was 200% more than that on our previous biggest day, which was October 6,” said Agarwal.
Responding to Flipkart’s Big Billion Day, Future Group, which owns the Big Bazaar retail chain, ran a full-page ad which read, “No deal can win the trust of a billion people. You continued…

From Pomegranate to Flax seeds: Seven seeds with health benefits
From beverages to bars, seeds are everywhere nowadays thanks to the nutrition they provide. Here are some seeds and their benefits.
Pomegranate for slimming: Nature's "sweet tarts", the juicy seed is a low-calorie winner. It's packed with antioxidants and fat-burning vitamin C so go for it if you want to lose some weight.
Hemp for toned muscles: It's one of the few vegetarian sources of complete protein as it contains all 20 amino acids, key to building calorie-burning muscle. Sprinkle some in a post workout shake for a pine nut-like flavour.
Chia for strong bones: Eat this earthy-tasting seed for its calcium. Two tablespoons offer as much as a slice of cheddar! Mix half a cup with two and a half cups of unsweetened almond milk, one tablespoon maple syrup and cinnamon to taste, and chill for a tapioca like pudding.
Pumpkin for energy: This light and nutty pepita houses iron, a mineral that helps maintain high energy levels. Roast one cup of seeds with half a tablespoon each of paprika, chili powder and sea salt for an easy to-go snack.
Sesame for a healthy heart: The rich seed contains linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid that may help control harmful cholesterol. Toasting amplifies flavour and adds a nice crunch to salads.
Flax for cancer prevention: Nutty flax has cancer-thwarting compounds called lignans and omega-3 fatty acids that reduce disease-causing inflammation.
Wheat germ for digestion: A small part of a wheat kernel, this slightly sweet seed has inulin, a type of fibre that helps maintain good digestion.

Lenovo Vibe X2 launched at Rs 19 999: The processor  extra layers will set this phone apartEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Lenovo might be new to the smartphone game, but it is clearly nurturing dreams of changing the game. Over the past few months the company has had a slew of devices that have made it a significant player in the market, followed by the acquisition of Motorola which has pushed it up to the third slot among smartphone manufacturers in India. Now, the company is bringing it devices which will stand apart in the crowded Android market while trying to create a niche for itself.
The latest launch from Lenovo is the Vibe X2, what the company calls a layered phone. The layers are apparent in the design, which is made of three distinct layers in different colours. This slim layered design makes the device look young and vibrant, and that is the segment the phone is aimed for. But the layers don’t end there.
Lenovo will be selling extra battery and JBL speaker layers to be clipped on to the phone. The extra battery will make the phone thicker and heavier, but it also doubled the battery life from the original 2300 mAh.
The Lenovo Vibe X2 is priced at Rs 19,999 and will be available on Flipkart from November 10.
The phone also stands out for its processor, which is chipmaker MediaTek’s big entry into the top-end segment. Our initial experience with the phone suggests that MediaTek 6595m 2.0 GHz 4G LTE True8Core processor can give the big players a run for their money.
The phone also features the Vibe UI, which gives users a lot of customisation options. Interestingly, the OS gives users access to their most used apps on the lock screen itself. Plus you can click a photo in one tap, even when the phone is locked, so that you don’t miss out much.

Catalonia holds independence vote in defiance of SpainPrint
A man looks at information on a table about an informal poll scheduled for next Sunday in a street in Girona, Spain, on Saturday Nov. 8, 2014. The pro-independence regional government of Catalonia stages a symbolic poll on secession in a show of determination and defiance after the Constitutional Court suspended its plans to hold an official independence referendum following a legal challenge by the Spanish government. (Source: AP)
By: Associated Press | Barcelona | Posted: November 9, 2014 11:39 am | Updated: November 9, 2014 11:43 am
One of Spain’s biggest and richest regions, Catalonia, will today hold a much-disputed symbolic vote on whether it should break away as an independent state, in defiance of the central government. Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s conservative government has vowed to defend the unity of the country, as it recovers from a steep economic downturn, and has mounted a series of constitutional appeals to try to block the vote.
But Catalans have pushed ahead defiantly, fired up by the independence referendum held in Scotland in September, even though Scots voted not to break away from Britain. Rajoy says his country cannot hold an independence referendum like Scotland because, unlike Britain, it has a written constitution that forbids it.
He downplayed the significance of the poll, at a party rally on Saturday in the eastern city of Caceres. “What will take place tomorrow, we can call it whatever one wants, but it is not a referendum, not a consultation, nor anything that resembles it, I can’t even qualify it. What is certain is that it will not have any effect,” he said.
Proud of its distinct language and culture, Catalonia, a region of 7.5 million people, accounts for nearly a fifth of Spain’s economy. Demands for greater autonomy there have been rumbling for years, but the latest bid by the region’s president Artur Mas has pushed the issue further than ever before.
Catalonia took a step towards greater autonomy in 2006 when it formally adopted a charter that assigned it the status of a “nation”. But in 2010 Spain’s Constitutional Court overruled that nationhood claim, fuelling pro-independence passions.
Spain’s recent economic crisis has increased unemployment and hardship in the region and swelled its debts, but in 2012 Rajoy rejected Mas’s request for greater powers for Catalonia to tax and spend. In response, Mas vowed to hold an official yet
non-binding vote on independence, but the Spanish government’s legal challenges forced him to water that down.
Sunday’s polls will be staffed by volunteers. Some 41,000 have signed up for the job.

RIP Nokia! Microsoft to launch first non-Nokia Lumia phone on Nov 11The new Lumia handset would feature the Microsoft logo.
By: PTI | New York | Posted: November 7, 2014 6:58 pm
Months after closing its USD 7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia’s handset unit, tech giant Microsoft is expected to launch the first non-Nokia branded Lumia smartphone on November 11. IndianExpress.com had earlier reported in August 2014 about Nokia’s complete transition into Microsoft .
In a teaser on its Conversations blog, Microsoft today said: “Microsoft is delivering the power of everyday mobile technology to everyone. Come back on November 11, to find out more!”
It includes teaser shots on the look of the device without disclosing the features. Reports suggest that the new handset would feature the Microsoft logo, 5-inch display, 1.2GHz processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB storage.
Last month, Microsoft had confirmed that it plans to do away with the Nokia brand on Windows Phone-based devices.
“We are looking forward to unveiling a Microsoft Lumia device soon. This is of course a natural progression as all devices that once came from Nokia now come from Microsoft,” Microsoft Senior Vice President of Marketing for Phones Tuula Rytila had said.

Bureaucracy wonders how Goa will run without Parrikar(The finances of Goa are in…)
By: Sandesh Prabhudesai
End-November 2004: the 35th edition of the Indian Film Festival of India (IFFI) is for the first time being held in Goa. Sceptics — who are as easy to find as taverns — wonder aloud whether Goa has the infrastructure to host a festival that is already being compared to the one in Cannes, and whether the venue in the capital of Panaji would be ready in time.
Goa was indeed ready. And perhaps for many the showstopper wasn't Amitabh Bachchan or Shah Rukh Khan or Oliver Stone's controversial epic Alexander or Mira Nair's Vanity Fair. Rather, it was Manohar Parrikar in his trademark untucked shirt, loose trousers and sandals.
If the IFFI has become a permanent fixture in Goa — the 45th edition will begin on November 20 — a fair section of Goans will acknowledge (some grudgingly) the efforts of the then chief minister (CM) Parrikar, in his first term between 2000 and 2005.
When he became CM in October 2000, the BJP's first CM, he was looked upon with suspicion by virtually a fourth of Goa's population: the Christians who found it difficult to trust a man seeped in the Hindutva ideology of the RSS. Naturally, Parrikar had to face severe criticism from the Church, too.
By 2012, it was a different story. After the Parrikar-led BJP lost the state elections in 2007, five years later it was back with an absolute majority of 21 in a 40-member House (24 with allies).
And the amazing part: six of his MLAs were Christian. By then the community and the Church were disillusioned with a 'corrupt' Congress and for the grand old party taking them for granted. A 'communal' BJP appeared a better choice.
"Yes, we will miss him," admits writer-turned-politician Vishnu Wagh, who represents a Christian-dominated constituency in north Goa. But he looks at Parrikar's new assignment as a blessing in disguise. "We were over dependent on him. Now we need to behave in a more responsible manner as we have no Parrikar to fall upon," adds Wagh, a firm critic of the former CM on many an occasion.
Siddharth Kunkolienkar, one of his close aides, is disappointed but looks positively at his new assignment. "It's a gain rather than a loss for the party," he says.
The Unfinished Agenda
But the bureaucracy wonders how the state will run without Parrikar at the helm. The finances of Goa are still in a shambles, with the state still not having fully recovered from the setback it received due to total ban on mining activity.
  "The ban reduced our revenue directly by 25% and around 15% indirectly. Still, I was running the state for the last 30 months without allowing the common man to feel the pinch," a visibly emotional Parrikar said in a choked voice as he prepared to leave the state.
Before the ban, Goa was used to earning revenues of Rs 1,400 crore a month from mining. The regular monthly expenditure of salaries, pension, social schemes, power purchase and loan payments works out to Rs 400 crore. Parrikar has managed to break even by personally monitoring revenue earnings on a day-to-day basis and getting roughly Rs 410 crore through commercial taxes, excise, non-tax revenues and share of central taxes.
"It has been a hand-to-mouth position from the time mining activity was banned," admits a senior official in the finance ministry. He wonders whether Parrikar's successor would be able to monitor the financials as efficiently.
Parrikar at the Centre also means that there's an unfinished agenda back in Goa. For instance, in its 2012 manifesto, the BJP had promised to scrap the 'Regional Plan' and draw up a new one with "people's participation in a transparent manner". However, not much has happened on that front, and the plan, according to NGOs and village gram sabhas, will encourage illegal buildings and ecological destruction. Parrikar had also promised to arrest mining scamsters, but that too remains a task incomplete.
While his failures in fulfilling the election promises are glaring, Parrikar deserves credit for shielding Goa from a full-blown financial crisis in the wake of the mining ban. The state for which he worked 18 hours a day for the past two decades as leader of the Opposition and also as chief minister will miss him. He will miss Goa, too.
"I will miss my state, my family and the fish," the 59-year-old widower said at a tearful Cabinet briefing on Friday. "I didn't want to go, but the nation comes first." Many back in Goa may be wishing it didn't have to be that way.

Mixed feelings over Parrikar leaving state: Goa ArchbishopFilipe Neri Ferrao
(Goa Archbishop Filipe Neri…)
PANAJI: Goa Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao said here today that people of Goa have mixed feelings over Manohar Parrikar leaving state politics to take up his new assignment at the Centre.
Parrikar met the Archbishop before tendering his resignation to Goa Governor Mridula Sinha .
"There is a mix reaction over you taking over as a union minister," the Archbishop told Parrikar during an informal meeting.
Parrikar also paid visit to three local temples. "There was lot of pressure on me not to leave the state. But I had to take it in the interest of nation," Parrikar, told Archbishop Ferrao.
Parrikar's meeting with the Archbishop holds significance as local Church had stood by the party during 2012 state assembly election.
The BJP legislative wing had six catholic MLAs which is unprecedented for the party, earlier labelled as communal.

Republicans win: Barack Obama faces double jeopardyBarack Obama
(The message from the US mid-term…)
The triumph of the Republican Party in mid-term elections to the US Congress is a severe setback to President Barack Obama , threatening to jam policymaking and stymie his legacy in the final two years of his office.
With both the Senate and the House of Representatives moving into firm Republican control, he faces double jeopardy and irreparable gridlock between legislature and executive.
Agonising tussles between the president and the Republican-majority House over budget ceilings, fiscal cliffs and shutdowns, coupled with blockage in Republican-ruled states of the president's signature initiatives, had already badly impaired governance prior to the mid-terms.
Now, the US president has to contend not only with the Republican House Speaker, John Boehner, who has been a constant thorn in the flesh, but also Mitch McConnell, who will assume the role of Republican Senate majority leader.
Although McConnell has struck a high sounding note about "working together" with Obama, the band of consensus between America's major parties is quite narrow due to uncompromising ideological polarisation.
Obama has vented frustration at the incompatibility between Congress and the White House by admitting that "our politics are dysfunctional" and warning that "societies don't work if political factions take maximalist positions".
The rise of the far right-wing Tea Party movement and the racist revulsion which mainstream Republicans feel towards Obama have been compounded by fear that the president's strategy of mobilising Hispanics, African Americans and liberal white voters could deny the White House to the Grand Old Party (GOP) for decades to come.
A Trench Warfare
Seasoned conservatives like McConnell, who has been branded by Politico as "the face of Republican obstructionism for most of Obama's presidency", are hellbent on undermining further consolidation of a progressive, youthful, crossclass and inter-racial Democratic coalition within the electorate.
Since Republicans are ideologically loathe to adjusting their views on socio-economic issues to make themselves more electable to the White House, creating policy logjams and sullying Obama's record is their default strategy to make him fail in the eyes of the public.
The US president, who has a superb knack for the popular pulse, has gone along with this Republican trench warfare knowing that Congress will bear most of the blame from voters for adamantly spoiling his well-meaning agenda for the country.
Voter turnout in the just-concluded mid-term elections was just 36%, reflecting how disillusioned Americans are about the Congress as a whole. The fact that Republicans were victorious is less a rejection of Obama than a reiteration of conservative values in the American south and west, where most of the 2014 mid-term races were held.
Overall, the message of this election is not that Americans are moving past Obama but rather that the people are tired of the proverbial Beltway shenanigans. Divided government — wherein different parties hold the reins in the two power centres of the American political system, ie Congress and White House — was devised by makers of the US Constitution as a bulwark against abuse of authority.
The 'Federalist No 51' essay written by James Madison in 1788 laid out the template for checks and balances between different arms of government in order to avert "concentration of the several powers in the same department".
Madisonian separation of powers did succeed in entrenching democratic practices in America and forestalling dictatorial takeovers. But the founding fathers of the American Republic would be churning in their graves today at the abuse of the concept of divided government, which is producing zero governance thanks to dereliction of responsibility by political parties.
The Silver Lining
The only silver lining for Obama is the expectation that the Republican ruled Congress will try to act somewhat less intransigently in view of the big 2016 presidential election contest. Republicans have already been forced to rethink the merits of forcing government shutdowns over budgets after reading public opinion, which sharply disapproved of their blackmail and brinkmanship tactics.
If Boehner and McConnell pay heed to hardline conservatives in their party, they would be helping along prospects for Hillary Clinton or some other Democrat retaining the presidency yet again in 2016.
Sadly, apart from coldblooded calculations about the electoral blowback of one's behaviour, what has been missing in American polity in recent times is respect for larger national and global interests that should restrain parties from wreaking havoc.
A weakened Obama whose every foreign policy priority — resolving conflict with Iran, carving out a Palestinian state, defeating Islamic extremists, accommodating Russia, promoting a multilateral climate change accord, and geostrategically 'pivoting' to Asia — will be rejected, tarnished or sabotaged in Congress cannot hope to be a global leader. With the Congressional monkey on his back, the US president's word and deed will be taken less seriously at the international level in his lame duck years.
A Republican-led legislature that is determined to tighten immigration, reverse regulation of Wall Street, boost fossil fuel-based industries, and roll back universal healthcare is not just sparring with Obama but ruining America's economic, environmental and social wellbeing. Ironically, the great democratic institutional design of James Madison is being harnessed to undo the greatness of America.

Niraj Antani: An Indian American law student wins in mid-term electionsIndian American
(Antani, for his part, will…)
In 2012, during Republican candidate Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, a 21-year-old Indian-American political science student at Ohio State University interned for Scott Jennings, the Ohio state director and senior adviser to the campaign.
Two years later, Niraj Antani has himself been elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, becoming one of the youngest state lawmakers in the US.
Antani attributes his victory to working harder than his opponents and talking about issues that the voters care about. "I believe we have real problems facing our state and that they must be addressed. We must work to create jobs and opportunity for all," he told ET Magazine in an email interview from his home in Miamisburg, Ohio.
Antani, who will be a new face in the Ohio state house next year, won from the house district 42 in southern Montgomery County, defeating his 62-year old Democrat opponent Patrick Morris. This was after winning the Republican Party's nomination for the seat over four candidates, all older than him, when their incumbent died earlier this year.
The 23-year-old doesn't see his youth as a disadvantage in politics. In fact, for him it's an enabler. "It is an advantage. I bring new ideas to the government, new approaches to problem-solving. Some may think I'm too young, but I believe my generation deserves a voice," he says.
Republican and Proud
His parents immigrated to America in 1978 and his mother Kokila has been supportive of his campaign. His father Jaimini — who died in 2010 — worked for tech major Hewlett-Packard for 35 years. "My parents immigrated from India; I was born here. The American Dream, for me, means that anyone who works hard can achieve their dreams," he says.
Dalip Singh Saund, the first Indian American member of the United States House of Representatives from 1957 to 1963, was a Democrat; historically Indians and other immigrant communities have been drawn to the Democratic Party.
However, for the next generation the trend is changing with many young Indian Americans being drawn to the resurgent Republican Party, feels Antani.
"Indian Americans have a conservative culture and are conservative fiscally. I hope more Indian Americans get involved in politics," he says, having connected with the community in his district in a big way during his campaign. "They were very supportive," he adds. Antani will become the second Indian American member of the Ohio state house after Jay Goyal, a Democrat, who was a member for three terms from 2007 to 2013.
 
Changing Trends
Sanjay Puri, chairman of US India Political Action Committee, a bipartisan organization that supports all Indian American community members running for various public offices in the US, is upbeat about the success of various community members in the elections.
"It is an endorsement of the trend that second- and third-generation Indian Americans are now looking beyond traditional fields like medicine and engineering that their parents and grandparents looked at and now feel confident in public life and are participating in large numbers," he says.
Puri adds that there were some excellent Indian-American candidates in the current US elections, though some may have lost because of the Republican wave or an entrenched incumbent.
"Indian Americans originally settled down on the two coasts — California and New York [both Democratic strongholds] — and were inclined towards supporting the Democrats. But things will change if the Republicans do a proactive outreach towards the community since Indian Americans are fiscally conservative and socially liberal," adds Puri.
Significantly, the most high-profile victory for the Indian American community in the just-concluded US election was of Nikki Haley — the Republican governor of South Carolina, who won a second consecutive term.
Antani, for his part, will focus on creating jobs and opportunity for all in his district as a freshly minted lawmaker — and at the same time continue with his legal education at the University of Dayton.

Power shift in US Senate brings sterner tone to foreign policy debateBarack Obama
(Republicans in Senate will…)
WASHINGTON: The Republican takeover of the US Senate will bring a tough new tone to the debate over Washington's foreign policy, with lawmakers expected use their new clout and power over the budget to promote a more interventionist foreign policy.
While leaders of the Democratic-majority Senate mostly backed President Barack Obama's international goals, Republicans plan to pressure the White House to take a tougher line on Iran, Russia and Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria.
"I think the Congress can and will be heard from, particularly on the funding side," John Thune, a member of the Senate's Republican leadership, said in a telephone interview.
After Republicans, who already controlled the House of Representatives, won a majority in the Senate on Tuesday, two of Washington's most vocal foreign policy hawks, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, came in line to chair two key Senate panels.
McCain, who has advocated a more robust response in both Ukraine and Syria, will lead the Senate Armed Services Committee, which oversees military policy. That includes a say in the budget, giving him a strong lever on policy.
Graham is due to chair the Senate appropriations subcommittee that controls the State Department's budget and can withhold or grant aid to foreign governments.
Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, in line to be chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is known as a consensus-builder. But he has backed a sterner policy for Syria and lamented what he sees as a lack of communication with lawmakers by the Democratic White House, which could mean more hearings.
The Foreign Relations committee has the power to approve or reject Obama's nominees for ambassadorships and top State Department positions before they face a full Senate vote.
IRAN DEADLINE LOOMS
The Senate's power shift also could have a big influence on deals the administration reaches with other countries.
An early opportunity for the Republicans to flex their new muscle will come with the agreement that Obama is trying to negotiate with Iran by Nov. 24 to curb its nuclear program.
To reach a deal, Obama must be able to convince Tehran that Washington will lift sanctions. Republicans, who worry that Obama will make too many concessions, are talking about turning the screw on Tehran and imposing yet more sanctions.
Democrats and Republicans are at odds about when to vote on a new authorization Obama wants for his campaign against Islamic State. Democrats want a vote before they hand over power in January, while Republicans want to delay until then.
While Obama and other Democrats want a ban on US ground troops in the conflict, many leading Republicans insist that all options should be open.
The new Congress is expected to take a tougher line against Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine, including pushing for more sanctions. Some Republicans favor sending US weapons to Kiev, a move Obama as well as most NATO allies reject.
There are limits on how assertive the new Congress will be, as the Republican Party also includes members who want less foreign involvement, including a likely 2016 presidential contender Senator Rand Paul.
"It's going to be interesting to see if the Republican tone differs now that they have the responsibility to govern rather than just criticize," said Democratic Senator Christopher Murphy, a Senate Foreign Relations Committee member.

Who will bag the Rs 50 000-crore order for six submarinesDefence ministry
(Early guesses suggest that…)
It was a tough afternoon on October 13 at Hindustan Shipyard Ltd (HSL). Cyclone Hudhud had ravaged Visakhapatnam in the morning, damaging the defence ministry shipyard as well as every other industry in the coastal town.
HSL chairman and managing director NK Mishra had prepared a contingency plan — he had retained key people inside the plant overnight and hired portable diesel generator sets. He was fighting to keep his date with Indian Navy — a promise to float INS Sindhukirti, the Navy's submarine, by October 31.
The submarine has been in refit mode for seven years. However, Mishra's contingency plan was not working. Pieces of the roof kept falling and no worker was ready to enter the building dock. Mishra decided to do what he had to do — put on a helmet and walk in first. The workforce fell in line and HSL lost only half a day to Hudhud.
For the Indian Navy, urgency is critical. Today, it has an ageing fleet of 14 submarines manning Indian waters. The U-boats are key in the Indian Ocean where it is tougher to detect enemy subs because of higher water temperatures, and therefore important to have a large fleet of India's own scouring the deep waters. The Navy had lost the INS Sindhurakshak to a blast in Mumbai in 2013.
Another submarine, INS Sindhuratna, had caught fire in February 2014, killing two. Getting the Sindhukirti back in operation would help the Navy in the near term — especially till it gets new submarines. Mishra's team was finally able to undock Sindhukirti on November 4. Hudhud had deposited silt in the jetty, blocking the way that had to be dredged out.
Meanwhile, between Hudhud and the undocking of Sindhukirti, the world of Indian submarine engineers changed. The defence ministry announced on October 25 its intention to get six new submarines manufactured in India. It had shortlisted seven shipyards that it wanted to evaluate for this job. Naturally, HSL was one of them. But despite its experience in re-fitting subs, it is not the frontrunner.
Public-private One-upmanship
The flavour of the submarine procurement announcement was definitely the Indian defence private sector. Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and Pipavav Defence — the two private sector shipyards — had been listed along with five defence ministry shipyards.
  Coming after almost a decadeand-a-half-long engagement in fits and starts by the defence ministry with the Indian private sector and a clamour for more (this NDA government has already opened up 49% Foreign Direct Investment in defence), the announcement seemed to drop broad hints.
Can the private sector deliver on time in an area where the public sector has repeatedly faltered? Mazagon Dock Ltd (MDL), a Government of India undertaking, in Mumbai, for instance, is building six Scorpene attack submarines with French collaboration and all of them are three to four years behind schedule.
Mishra could sense that HSL was starting the race in fourth position; even MDL, in spite of the delays, seems ahead of it, thanks to its experience in building subs. Mishra makes his case forcefully.
"HSL was brought under the defence ministry to manufacture submarines. Today, I am crying for orders with an order book of only Rs 1,500 crore," he says.
Mishra adds that re-fitting of submarines is a much more complicated task than building one and therefore HSL was ready for the task; he then went on to launch into an old-fashioned rant against the private sector and its reliability. The private sector has its own narratives.
Meet Nikhil Gandhi, the entrepreneur who reminds every interviewer of his paan-wala roots, especially as it somewhat mirrors prime minister Narendra Modi's chai-wala beginnings. Gandhi used to be a small-time Kolkata businessman who ferried the famous Kolkata betel leaves to Mumbai in trains and carried back toys to sell in the City of Joy more than two decades ago.
Today, the Gandhi-promoted Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering Company has built the world's second largest dry-dock in India and was the first private sector Indian shipyard that got permissions to build warships. That Gandhi built his shipyard in Gujarat's Saurashtra may give him an extra brownie point today.
Gandhi also has a tie-up with Swedish defence and aerospace company SAAB and a joint venture agreement with MDL. "We are negotiating one more joint venture proposal with a global major with capacity in warships and submarines," Gandhi says and adds that the large facilities he has created are an obvious magnet for global defence majors.
Then there is L&T, led by the feisty AM Naik. It has financial muscle — standalone net profits of just under Rs 5,500 crore in 2013-14 — unlike Gandhi whose company is saddled with Rs 7,000 crore of debt and its request for Rs 1,355 crore of working capital loan is stuck, pending reworking of its debt.

MANGALURU: Two new Air Cushion Vehicles (ACVs) acquired by the coast guard, H-196 and H-198, would be commissioned by Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala at the Coast Guard complex at Panambur near here on November 10.
The ACVs would complement the existing four inshore patrol vessels with the Coast Guard, Deputy Inspector General of Indian Coast Guard and Karnataka commander Rajamani Sharma said.
The 21-metre-long ACV with 31 tons displacement could achieve a maximum speed of 45 knots, he said. It was capable of undertaking multifarious tasks such as surveillance, interdiction, search and rescue and rendering assistance to small boats and crafts.
The craft could move on land and sea. It operates by skimming over the surface of the water using a cushion of air created by two propellers fitted on top of the craft.
It was fully armed with heavy machine guns and latest state-of-the-art communication and navigation equipment, including radar and worldwide satellite communication, he said in a release here.

(INS Tarasa craft was handed…)
NEW DELHI: India has formally handed over the second fast attack craft INS Tarasa to the Seychelles Coast Guard to boost the country's anti-piracy effort and maritime security.
The craft was handed over by Naval Chief Admiral R K Dhowan yesterday in Seychelles and renamed 'Constant' by authorities there.
Presided by James Alix Michel , the country's President, as also Commander-in-Chief of the Seychelles defence forces, the ceremony was attended by a host of top ranking officers.
The Indian side was represented Dhowan who had flown in particularly for this event.
Dhowan pointed out that the "waters of the Indian Ocean wash the shores of the two nations, not only making them maritime neighbours, but also bonding them closely in a relationship of deep and traditional economic, social and cultural links".
He went on to highlight the importance of the seas to the economic prosperity of both nations in the 21st century and the need to ensure maritime security in the Indian Ocean in the face of growing asymmetric and non conventional threats, so that both nations could grow and prosper unhindered, a statement released by the Navy said.
Dhowan stated that the transfer of INS Tarasa to the Seychelles Coast Guard would strengthen bilateral relationship further and bring the two nations even closer.
INS Tarasa is the second fast attack craft to be gifted by India to Seychelles in the recent times, the previous being INS Tarmugli that was renamed PS Topaz.
PS Constant and PS Topaz along with the Dornier Maritime Patrol aircraft, also gifted by India, are expected to operate together in the coming years, forming the core of the Seychelles Coast Guard's ability to keep the EEZ of the nation safe and secure from burgeoning maritime threats.

BJP tactically  hijacks  Aam Aadmi Party s broomAAP
(“Symbolically, the BJP has…)
During the Festival of Lights, a leaflet with the slogan "patakhon ki dhoom, uske baad broom" was distributed in over 600 primary schools in south Delhi by the municipal corporation, exhorting kids to ask their family members to clean the dirt left behind by burnt firecrackers.
Had this happened during Diwali 2013, the gambit would have been doubtless associated with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which had used the broom effectively to declare its intention to sweep out corruption and other ills plaguing the capital and the country.
Since last Diwali, however, much water — and grime — has flowed under the Yamuna: the AAP, after winning 28 of 70 seats in the Capital in the December 2013 polls, went on to form the government; stepped down in 49 days; and in mid-2014 took a drubbing in the Lok Sabha polls, failing to win a single seat in Delhi.
The AAP may still not be forgotten, but the broom may have since got a makeover in new hands; the "...uske baad broom" campaign was rolled out by the Delhi unit of the BJP, apparently as an extension of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by prime minister Narendra Modi on Gandhi Jayanti (October 2).
"The AAP is in a state of panic because we have taken their broom, although the motive of the prime minister was not meant to scare away the AAP but to clean India and sweep away corruption," says Ashish Sood, general secretary of the BJP's Delhi Unit. "If in that process their [the AAP's] broom has come into our hands it's collateral damage. We will make a clean sweep and win more than 50 seats," adds Sood, who is also chairman of the Education Committee of South Delhi Municipal Corporation, which spearheaded the broom campaign.
"The broom is now a symbol of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, reminding people not only to keep their environment clean but also reinforcing the efforts made by Modi to clean politics," avers Sandiip Kapur, founder and president of Promodome Communications, a Delhi-based advertising agency that executed the campaign. While Kejriwal's is an ordinary broom, Modi's is a magical broom, much like Harry Potter's, he adds.
Hijacking the Broom
"Symbolically, the BJP has tactically hijacked the broom from the AAP," says Bidyut Chakrabarty, a Delhi-based political analyst. And by doing so it has captured the imagination of the middle class which gravitated towards the AAP during last Assembly polls in Delhi, he adds. "When the prime minister of a country picked up the broom to clean the streets, it caught the imagination of the country as well as the middle class in Delhi."
The AAP, with its broom, created an instant brand recall and positive associations with its differentiated marketing. They had a strong and clutter-breaking brand identity. The broom not only symbolized the AAP's fight against rampant corruption, it also connected with the lower classes and marginalized sections of the society.
However, the implementation of brand promise by the AAP was disastrous and left a lot to be desired.
"Modi didn't hijack the broom from the AAP. He merely picked up the broom because AAP dropped it," says social scientist Shiv Visvanathan. Moreover, the AAP has been badly discredited due to its drama and resignation after 49 days and the trust deficit with people would be huge to bridge, he adds.
"Over time, people will associate the broom more with Modi's cleanliness drive rather than the AAP's political symbol," says Ashita Aggarwal Sharma, professor of marketing at SP Jain Institute of Management & Research. "It's a strategy of robbing the AAP of a strong brand property."
The use of the broom by the BJP is a kind of indirect ambush marketing, which involves the use of a certain brand's imagery or advertising themes by the rival brand without making specific reference to the 'hijacked' symbol. The brand which ambushes the other brand's property either benefits from the use of this imagery or dilutes the equity of the latter, explains Sharma. "What the BJP has been doing can also be termed as 'offline brand hijacking'."
However, Sharma sounds a word of caution for the BJP. "Leveraging too much on broom may dilute its own brand image," she says. It is good only as a tactic to support a campaign, she adds.
To be sure, an over-enthusiastic Delhi BJP landed itself in trouble on Wednesday with its 'litter and sweep' act. The state's party president Satish Upadhyay as well as former AAP member Shazia Ilmi were spotted clearing garbage which was apparently 'dumped' minutes before they arrived at India Islamic Cultural Centre in south Delhi for a Swachh Bharat event.
 
AAP Reloaded?
"The broom for them is a photo opportunity," declares Manish Sisodia, a senior AAP leader who was cabinet minister in Kejriwal's 49-day Delhi government. "Our broom will sweep away the BJP from Delhi this time."

(BJP candidates who lost…)
NEW DELHI: BJP candidates who lost previous Assembly elections by narrow margins will be the first choice during ticket distribution for the upcoming polls in the national capital.
"As of now, BJP has not taken any decision on ticket distribution for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections. However, party's candidates, who lost last assembly elections by thin margins, will be given first priority while distributing tickets for forthcoming polls," Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay said.
According to the BJP, party will also take youths and experienced persons on board against the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress .
"Although there are several deserving persons in the party who can be given tickets, we are yet to take decision in this regard," the Delhi BJP chief said.
In 2013 Delhi Assembly elections, several BJP candidates were defeated by AAP candidates with narrow margins.
As per date available on Election Commission's website, Delhi Cannt's AAP MLA Surender Singh defeated BJP candidate Karan Singh Tanwar with a margin of just 355 votes.
Besides, Sadar Bazar's AAP MLA Som Dutt had defeated BJP leader Jai Prakash with a margin of 796 while AAP MLA Dinesh Mohaniya from Sangam Vihar had defeated BJP candidate Shiv Charan Lal Gupta with margin of 777 votes.
Vikas Puri's AAP MLA Mahinder Yadav defeated BJP's candidate Krishan Gahlot with a margin of 405.
In the outgoing Assembly, BJP and its ally Akali Dal have 29 MLAs in a House of 67. Three seats fell vacant after the incumbents were elected to the Lok Sabha.
BJP had emerged as the single largest party in the December Assembly polls winning 31 seats but fell four seats short of a simple majority.
It had refused to form government then, saying it will not resort to any "unfair means" to take over the reins. AAP had formed the government in Delhi with the support of Congress.
The government led by Kejriwal had resigned on 14 February after the party's pet project, the Janlokpal Bill, could not be passed due to opposition from BJP and Congress. President's Rule was imposed on 17 February.

Brooms in limelight: Tracing the history of a hand-made tool that will remain a part of our lives
Vikram Doctor, ET Bureau Nov 9, 2014, 03.00AM IST

Sunday ET
(Brooms are much in the news…)
When Komal Kothari, the great folklorist of Rajasthan, started planning a museum based on his life's work of collecting and interpreting the traditions of his state he decided to focus on one object: the broom. It seemed to be a surprising decision — with all the wealth of objects and arts in the state, why start with something so common and utilitarian?
"Choosing the broom was a stroke of genius," says Rustom Bharucha, the writer and critic whose conversations with Kothari became a book — Rajasthan: an Oral History. "I realized it covers everything — pollution, purity, order, chaos, dirt, cleanliness." Ordinariness makes them universal. Every home has brooms, and most use multiple types whose separate tasks from cleaning courtyards to kitchens to cattle-pens to puja rooms sketch a picture of daily life.
Different brooms are made and used by different communities, like grass brooms by Banjaras and bamboo brooms by Harijans. They are made from a wide variety of materials, like grasses, reeds, date palm and coconut leaves, some local, some transported from across India. Brooms are big business, with huge volumes sold every year and possibly major money made by a few businessmen. Yet the actual brooms are still mostly handmade, by families who do it for basic sustenance, and with women doing much of the work. And all this was even before one got into their ritual uses or role in political activism. "The entire world can be traced in the broom," says Bharucha.
Kothari passed away in 2004, but his vision was realized in Arna-Jharna, the Desert Museum of Rajasthan, which is in Jodhpur. As he wished, its first exhibit was on brooms and Bharucha, who was project director of the museum from 2007-2009, asked documentary filmmaker and photographer Navroze Contractor to take images for it. This developed into a film, the fascinating Jharu Katha, which depicts a world of traditions, work, rituals and community issues revolving around brooms in just the Jodhpur area.
Broom Politics
Brooms are much in the news now. They have been ever since the Aam Admi Party (AAP) chose a broom as its symbol. Prime minister Narendra Modi's launch of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has involved much posing with brooms. It has been like the ice-bucket challenge in India, with politicians and celebrities rushing to be seen sweeping up some carefully placed garbage. Broom stories abound — recently Baba Ram Raheem of the Dera Sacha Sauda in Haryana visited Mumbai with hundreds of followers, all wielding big brooms with which they set about energetically cleaning up a rather surprised city.
Some months back The Times of India carried a report on how broom traders were doing very well from all this clamour for cleaning. They had even devised a broom for "political consumption" that was less wide and thick, more for show than use, and priced at `7 against the regular `20. But whatever this might say about the cleaning power of today's political brooms, symbolism has always been part of the use of brooms. The very act of wielding them signals domesticity and responsibility, the clearing of a space for living amid the unswept chaos of the wilderness.
Brooms signify health, which is why the goddess Shitala, associated with skin diseases like smallpox, carries one. "Shitala causes the disease when angry and takes the disease away when calmed down," writes mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik. He describes an occult ritual, shown in Jharu Katha, of a peacock feather broom being use to sweep away 'nazar' or bad influences from the body. Jharu Katha also shows the shrine of Dher Baba Pir in Barmer where a broom is given as an offering.
Symbolic Power
Yet these auspicious uses of brooms have their opposites. Brooms symbolised the degraded roles forced on untouchables, who sometimes had to wear them as tails to sweep away 'contamination' from behind them (Ketan Mehta's film Bhavni Bhavai, now available on Youtube, vividly depicts this). Beating someone with a broom is seen as particularly cursed — in Jharu Katha one speaker says that anyone who beats a child with a broom will be that child's slave in their next life for as many years as there are twigs in the broom. And in Mumbai's underworld, jharu was slang for the Chinese made AK57 assault rifle which could perform a rather different type of 'cleaning'.

CHENNAI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cleanliness drive programme, the Swachh Bharat campaign, today received more star power with veteran actor Kamal Haasan wielding the broom to mark his 60th birthday at a lake near here.
The actor, who was nominated by Modi last month when the Prime Minister launched the programme, wielded the broom at the Rajakilpakkam lake near here and was joined by scores of his fans and his monitored welfare movement.
The self-confessed atheist star expressed joy over being 'recognised' by the Prime Minister and said, "We are religion-free and colourless as far as politics is concerned.
"We hope this movement is strengthened," he added reiterating his earlier statement that today's effort was nothing new for him or his supporters as "we have been doing this for a long time."
Such an effort was part of nation-building exercise, he said, welcoming more people to join him.
Earlier, actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan and Hrithik Roshan had responded to the call by Modi who had nominated them besides Haasan.

NOIDA: Hailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' as a great move, Bollywood star Aamir Khan said that not just celebrities but every citizen should participate in this movement to make the country clean.
The 49-year-old actor, who was present during the launch of the 'Swachh Bharat' mission in the capital last month, said that everyone should make cleanliness a habit.
"The 'Swachh Bharat' campaign started by our Prime Minister is a great move. Not only celebrities but every citizen should join this movement and not just for one day but ever single days from now on. We should make it a habit that we will not throw garbage anywhere on the road," he said.
The Bollywood actor, who has been raising awareness about various social issues with his TV show 'Satyamev Jayate', added, "Solid and liquid waste management should be adopted. Our office in Mumbai is completely waste free. We recycle our waste."
Besides Aamir, other celebrities who have lent their support to 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' are Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Hrithik Roshan, Kamal Haasan, Anupam Kher among others.

Wishberry - a crowdfunding platform s unique modelYou are here: Home > Collections > Investors
How Wishberry, a crowdfunding platform, has positioned itself at the intersection of creativity & commerce

(What makes Wishberry stand…)
By: Jyoti Pande Lavakare
They sell you dreams. Your own dreams, actually. And then they help you fund those dreams, to make them a reality.
Wishberry, a crowdfunding platform cofounded by two high- energy, articulate and intelligent entrepreneurs, is an unashamed knock off of an existing, successful idea that international platforms such as Indiegogo (founded in 2008), Kickstarter (2009), Pozible (2010) and others captured early. Many similar Indian funding platforms have spawned from the originals — including Wishberry in its current avatar (2012).
But what makes Wishberry stand out from others is not just its focus on the creative spaces (Australian crowdfunder Pozible has a similar model) but how its co founders — Anshulika Dubey and Priyanka Agarwal — have tweaked the international Do It Yourself (DIY) model to fit into the Indian ethos of handholding and tutoring.
"Wishberry is a risk- free way to bring creative, innovative ideas to life," says Agarwal, freshly energized from having raised funds from around 40 investors in the past three weeks.
It was only after many iterations from a crowdgifting site around weddings to a charitable crowdfunder of marathons that Wishberry finally found its identity. The fact that it was agile enough to reinvent itself again and again until it found its niche is the reason why it hasn't ended up disappearing into the abyss of Internet history, the fate of many similar sites. "Wishberry will democratize funding for every Indian youth yearning to follow his or her dreams," Agarwal said.
Rescuing Creativity
Wishberry's own dream — to attract more money from investors to scale up the venture — came true last week when it closed on its desired amount of Rs 4 crore in exchange for 27% of its equity. Of this, around Rs 3 crore came from well -known investors such as Rajan Anandan, Sharad Sharma, TV Mohandas Pai and Deep Kalra on LetsVenture, a curated, online deal-making platform, and Rs 1 crore from seven investors in a dramatic, reality-television -type event called "TiE the Knot" on October 17 at TiEcon 2014, a conference organized by The Indus Entrepreneurs.
Of course, it wasn't as easy to 'TiE the Knot' as it sounds. Before committing to any funds, grizzled, greying heads grilled the ex-McKinsey duo about their revenue model, existing projects, regulatory risks, valuation, market size, competition, entry barriers, exit plan, risks and rewards and other financial indicators.
Agarwal and Dubey answered effortlessly and confidently, throwing out comparative data, financial numbers, startling statistics, attention-grabbing ploys (screw it, lets do it) and saucy taglines (go fund yourself!) with equal ease. Their idealistic claim? "Rescuing Indian creativity since 2012," on their website pitch video.
  "Our coaches help project creators pitch their ideas to online communities in exchange for exclusive rewards and recognition — there is no charity or financial returns involved," Dubey said at TiEcon. Wishberry charges a fee (less than 10% of amount raised) for providing its platform, coaching and other help. "Funders turn into early adopters, mentors and partners, thereby validating the idea and facilitating growth," she added.
This focus on training creators on communication, social marketing and stringent project curation has resulted in a 75% funding success rate, which is three times the industry average. Locally, Wishberry has mobilized Rs 3.75 crore, more than 10 times its largest competitor, from a community of 8,500 funders, 8% of whom have funded more than once on Wishberry, the founders say.
Even Indiegogo has mobilized less than Rs 1 crore in creative projects coming out of India with success rates of less than 10%, said Agarwal, a bachelor in business & engineering from UPenn (University of Pennsylvania). The idea of a startup functioning at the intersection of idealism and commerce is especially attractive to the millennial generation, which is known to do -good -while- doing- well. And what Wishberry does is access the inner dreamer and idealist resident in all of us and sell that dream back to us.
Platforms like Wishberry not just greenlight innovative projects that would likely have withered without the oxygen of monetary validation, they also give ordinary people the permission to participate in an extraordinary journey, whether their own or someone else's, making creative dreams possible.
India's crowdfunding platform space is itself crowded — from IgniteIntent to Start51, Catapooolt, Fundapeer, Fundlined, Pik A Venture, Pitchhike, Make it Now, the list of idealist mercenaries who believe in the ability of people to turn ideas into reality and want to empower them to do so is unending.

Hedge funds pump $525 mn into Indian tech startups in Jan-OctHedge funds pump $525 million into Indian tech startups in January-October

Save precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI: Spurred by the fast-paced growth of Indian technology startups, a new set of hedge funds is starting to lay bets on private internet ventures as valuations soar for these companies.
While Wall Street biggie Tiger Global invested early on in Flipkart - which is now valued at $7 billion - and a dozen other internet startups, a bunch of new names like Steadview Capital, Lionrock Capital , Tybourne Equity Fund and Falcon Edge have entered the domestic startup ecosystem in the past one year eyeing future returns.
This has resulted in overall investments from hedge funds in the consumer tech sector going up to $525 million this year (January to October) against $133 million last year, a fourfold jump, according to data compiled by Venture Intelligence for TOI. The number of deals has increased from twelve in 2013 to eighteen till October this year.
While venture capitalists invest for the long term, involving themselves with startups closely at an early stage, hedge fund investments may seem like a risky proposition, espe cially for younger startups. Coming at a time when Indian tech startups are drawing frothy valuations, hedge funds are seen as pushing these valuations further up.
Tarun Davda, a director at the US venture fund Matrix Partners India , said, "The Indian market dynamics have changed very rapidly -there is political stability, a large and fast growing internet user base, increase in mobile smart phone penetration and the emergence of early market leaders in several sectors. Many of these hedge funds have invested in similar businesses in other markets and have got good returns. They understand that the Indian market is finally ripe for picking ...and they are willing to pay a valuation premium."
The New York-based Tiger Global, which has already invested upwards of $600 million in Flipkart, is particularly active in India. Its portfolio includes Myntra (acquired earlier this year by Flipkart), Olacabs, online classified player Quikr, and a Polyvore-type social commerce site Limeroad, besides others.
Funds like Hong Kong-based Steadview Capital (Olacabs, Urban Ladder and Savaan) and the New York fund Falcon Edge, which has invested in Housing.com, are aggressively chasing some of the midto-late stage startups, people privy with the matter said. An investor with a VC firm who did not want to be named said that hedge funds typically have a short-term thinking and usually follow a momentum-driven investing thesis. They are not as helpful in building the business on the ground. But Indian entrepreneurs seem to think otherwise as they close deals with these hedge funds.
"These hedge funds are mostly co-investing with VCs in startups that have scaled up. They are spotting the opportunities now because a handful of these companies may go public when they can exit and make handsome returns," said Harish HV, partner at Grant Thornton India.

How startups are wooing investors with innovative technologyHow startups like Mukunda Foods and Seven Summits Studio are wooing investors with innovative technology

(A machine to make dosa, a…)
BENGALURU: Indian startups which are working on technology that suit the local taste -in some instances, quite literally too, are making investors take notice.
Bengaluru's Mukunda Foods, which developed an automated dosa-making machine and is working on similar products for samosa and aloo tikki, is backed by Indian Angel Network. A low-cost, energy efficient, semi-automated sanitary napkin making machine developed by a 22-year-old as his final-year project at a Gurgaon engineering college, and a game that seeks to educate about rampant female foeticide have attracted attention from government and other agencies.
New entrepreneurs aren't afraid of developing products from scratch, said Padmaja Ruparel, president of Indian Angel Network. "That's a very good sign."
Indian Angel Network invested an undisclosed amount in Mukunda Foods. The company launched Dosamatic in last January, after getting the funding. Machines to make samosa and aloo tikki are likely to hit the market in the coming months.
Products like Dosamatic have been developed primarily keeping India in mind, unlike many other technologies that startups work on with the global market as target. For these entrepreneurs, the focus has been on the challenges the country faces and the average Indian consumer requirement, though they do find takers in foreign markets too.
Surbhit Arora, the 22-year-old who developed the low-cost sanitary napkin making machine at ITM University , is backed by a collaborative initiative between the National Institute of Design and the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. Arora, who says he drew inspiration from Coimbatore-based Arunachalam Muruganantham, the inventor of the world's first low-cost sanitary napkin machine, was recognized by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and various non-governmental organisations for the product. "You need a good high-quality product, apart from a good business model, to make it an overall success. It's going to happen very soon," said Arora, who is currently a working professional, but continues his research to improve the quality of the product before building a company around it.
Asar Dhandala , co-founder of Hyderabad-based gaming venture Seven Summits Studio, developed Just Born, a Windows app that highlights the highly prevalent practice of female foeticide. Dhandala, 20, is among a few gamers who were selected for the NASSCOM Gaming Forum. Dhandala's Petite, another game that looks at the health of the girl child, got recognition from UNESCO's Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development.
"UNESCO MGIEP is working to channel the potential of innovative technology by encouraging gaming for change in education for peace, sustainability and global citizenship," said Director Anantha K Duraiappah. The institute is an initiative between UNESCO and the Indian government.
"You need technology to scale up, and cater large quantities, especially in the food business.That was the idea behind Dosamatic," said Mukunda Foods' cofounder Eshwar K Vikas, a graduate of SRM University in Tamil Nadu. The machine can pop out plain, masala or paper dosas in under a minute with the press of a button.

Why  food photo bombing  on social sites is not coolWhy the social media menace of 'food photo bombing' is really about showing off

Right up there with Diwali bakshish bastardry, rampant homeopathy and long-form journalism is the pernicious social menace of food photobombing. People may not be serious about this global menace yet, but if this brutal practice of taking photographs of food one is having and sharing them on social media is not tackled head on, we are likely to see more than half of the world's population living off food pictures and not food.
As is wont with all such things, at the source of this abomination is the television. And, for a change, the fault lies not in our primetime newscasting stars. Those expensive recipe books by Jamie Oliver and Kylie Kwong printed on glossy paper that gobbled up the plainer Tarla Dalals and Jiggs Kalras were the products of highbudget low-cholestrol TV tie-ins. With the industrial-military complex now successful in napalming our television channels with Padma Lakshmi stirring something in a kitchen and Nigella Lawson's body parts reacting to sauteed conditions, eating food has become secondary.
You listen to Heston Blumenthal talking us through some concoction as if he was explaining quantum mechanics to a plate of spotted dick (a pudding popular in Britain). And you see those dishes marinated with ditzy drama in those MasterBate cook-offs. Somewhere down the line, recipes — both on our shelves and unfurled on our television sets — suddenly moved from being purely DIY manuals/shows to something overwhelmingly visual that you could frame on your wall and lick when lonely. Never since the 17th century Dutch baroque still-lifes has food stopped being food and start being something you are meant to look at.
But it was with the advent of the mobile phone cameras and social media platforms that what began as photos of homies having a meal together became photos of a plate of hummus. Earlier, it was vaguely about humans having a coq au vin for dinner. Now it's coq au bull snaps with no eaters around to be seen. With captions that demand and elicit comments like 'Yummy!', 'OMG' and the more sophisticated 'Where?' from folks who would probably never taste the dish that they find yummy-looking, uploading food photos on the ether has become the new 'photos from our holiday'. And the way no one dares to point out how ugly the baby is after a parent has posted its photo on Facebook, I'm yet to come across a reaction on the lines of 'My god, what an ugly turd-up on that plate!'
Now, I do believe food pictures serve a certain utilitarian function. Reading the description on a menu not only won't do, but it can also addle the brain and counter the tongue — especially after the man comes to explain what the soup of the day is. When I go to Karim's or Golden Dragon, even after knowing how their bheja masala and chilli shrimp dry respectively taste, I look at the pictures on the menus and reaffirm my faith in their taste.
Brain Teasers
Even when I'm looking up at the back-lit Dunkin' Donuts billboard-menu to check how a yet-to-be-tasted Brute Tough Guy Chicken Burger possibly tastes like, I put my faith on the shiny photo of that edible Tower of Babel. So when the dish that looked like a Gautier model on the menu arrives at my table looking like NH7 roadkill, my belief in human goodness plummets to my gurda and kaleji. Therefore, yes, I do understand the importance of food photographers and the need to dexterously varnish a logpile of seekh kababs before they make themselves visible on the menu.
In the same vein, I can understand people taking photos of the dish that they have cooked. It's about taking pride in coming up with a good concoction, whether it be a chicken curry or a snotty child in his school uniform. But why the obsession to post pictures of food that one has ordered? Is it to share the joy that the picture-taker anticipates in having the dish? Then why not share photos of the eater faking an orgasm eating it?
Then is it to share the information that such a wondrous edible product exists far from the viewer's reach and gullet? That seems to be very close to taunting, and more in the line of taking your shirt off and showing off your six-pack (of beer) in front of an (obese) alcoholic in prohibitionary Ahmedabad. Which is why I certainly think that the purpose of people taking food photos is really about showing off: "I'm going to run my fork along this rack of lamb while you rip your roti. Ha!'
When the remains of human civilization will be discovered by some alien race in the centuries to come, they will ponder over a few things. Along with why Karan Johar movies were so popular and why every person did not actually make hay while the sun still hadn't depleted all its fuel, these aliens will be puzzled by the preponderance of pictures of food humans took. One social scientist among them will probably concoct a theory about the atavistic pleasure humans took in taking pictures of what they consumed, thereby connecting food photography and pornography — and, by extension, the rapid extinction of both eating and sex.
They will, alas, never know the truth about the primal need of humans to spread the singular message: I got this and you, sad paneer-pandering Pavlovian experiment, don't. And nothing does that better and with more devilish variety than the transmission of pictures of food.

MUMBAI: For most Indians, food is a very important part of travelling, a survey has found out.
"About 92 per cent respondents firmly believe in the power of food to connect them to the local culture and they make it a point to experience the destination's famed dish," says TripAdvisor's `Dining out on vacation' survey.
Yet, Indians are still warming up to the concept of `foodie vacation', as only 33 per cent have taken such trips to experience regional cuisines.
The survey was conducted amongst 1,200 Indian travellers. Majority, about 74 per cent, said they were foodies who prefer taste over healthy choices while on vacation.
Sixty-four per cent respondents admitted to indulging in non-healthy options when eating out during the vacation.
"It is interesting to see how Indians have started planning their dining experience well in advance. Genuine travel reviews have fuelled this trend and empowered travellers with choices," said TripAdvisor India Country Manager Nikhil Ganju.
He added that yet Indians are being safe in picking options when it comes to cuisine and restaurant type; 47 per cent respondents said they prefer Indian cuisine while 60 per cent respondents said they get influenced by restaurant promotions or deals.
While deals do attract the value-seeking Indian traveller, they do not mind shelling big bucks on quality dining options -- over 63 per cent are ready to spend between Rs 600-1,500 per person per meal.
The indulgent Indian traveller refuse to settle for poor food quality and service -- 58 per cent get annoyed if the food quality isn't up to the mark. For 23 per cent respondents, slow or poor service is a mood-spoiler.
And, more than half the travellers (57 per cent) have sent a meal back to the kitchen owing to the above factors.

DUBAI: A unique art installation made entirely of edible items to depict Dubai's famous skyline and iconic buildings, will be put on display here during a food festival next year.
The art work created by UK-based food artist Paul Baker , represents city's growing profile as a gastronomy destination and will be shipped to Dubai from London to be displayed during the Dubai Food Festival, which takes place 6-28 February 2015.
"To be asked to create a foodscape model of Dubai was an honour and a huge challenge. We had to incorporate as many landmark buildings and geological features as possible, all made from food that wouldn't deteriorate," Baker said.
"The challenge was to design and construct interesting and recognisable buildings from organic-looking shapes," he said.
Baker headed a team of six, made up of his best model makers. The team spent three weeks to create the foodscape.
One of the big initial questions was how to make the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa , which Baker describes as "the lynchpin of the whole project".
He eventually decided to use sweet corn - a total of 90 cobs - along with baby corn. After that, the rest of the buildings quickly fell into place.
Other famous Dubai landmarks depicted within the model include the Burj Al Arab, for which tubular pasta, lasagne pasta, tortilla wraps, cheese biscuits, diced barbecue chicken, dried herbs and shortbread biscuits were used to recreate the hotel's distinctive shape.
The Dubai World Trade Centre is made of milk and white chocolate bars, while a combination of white bread, pretzel sticks and roasted seaweed was used to model Jumeirah Emirates Towers.
The installation commissioned by the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, Dubai, is currently on display at this year's World Travel Market (WTM) in London.

Kiss me, said Kochi and all of India puckered up. But Kerala shook its head, frowning like a parent at a randy teenager

Kiss me, said Kochi and all of India puckered up. But Kerala shook its head, frowning like a parent at a randy teenager. No kissy wissy, said the state sternly to this naughty itsy-bitsy city; planting kisses on cheeks or elsewhere were like planting bombs along societal paths, didn't you know? Politicians slept uneasy, the sounds of slurpy kisses going off in their ears all night. Just when they were drafting the no-jeans policy for women came this no-kiss one! Police were told to watch out for lips — not guns — being drawn at dawn.
With the word 'kiss' in the air, testosterone ran high. Shops stocked up on mouth fresheners and breath mints. The youth began to practice furiously on pillows. Eve-teasers walked about in a daze: girls were going to stand still and not scream their heads off when they leaned over. Who, when and where to kiss? Read my lips, said the state.
Scramble for a Ringside View
On the day of the great smoocheroo people left things halfway in anticipation of hot action. Only to witness some very passionate lathi charge. Not many would-be kissers made it to Marine Drive, the kiss venue, handcuffed as they were at the start of the kissing trail itself, at the Ernakulam Law College, before they could put forward a foot, let alone a lip. As the police van zoomed off into the sunset, arrested participants gave each other a peck.
Life was no romcom for the policemen either who appeared to be on an arresting spree only because no one would kiss them! Mainly a men's-only event — 'Kiss of Love'— at Marine Drive turned out to be a congregation of voyeurs, not kissers. If respectable people were spotted, they were there only to drag home sisters or daughters who threatened to participate. Nobody wanted the lady of the house in a lip-lock on national television.
What followed was phenomenal pouting on the virtual front, with social media overdosing on the xoxo. 'Kiss of Love' got its own Wiki page. The world at large is now staring at Kerala's mouth, not only to hear what it has to say on the subject of kisses per se but also to kiss it back in case it ever decides to kiss.
The event, or non-event to be more precise, loosened the tongues of even the most no-nonsense non-French-kissing Malayali who finally opened his mouth — not to kiss but to opine. Dry chapped lips were dabbed with coconut oil and oral hygiene reigned supreme on November 2 for some serious inward pursing of mouth. Tch-tch, they went, not mwah-mwah.
The Third World long thought only the white man kissed, courtesy Hollywood fare. Plus, kissing has always been against Indian culture. Cave and temple etchings jump into midact straightaway, with nothing so polite as kissing in the picture. PDA, or public displays of affection, are for exhibitionists, pervs and foreigners. Children in science classrooms routinely suffer cardiac arrests when told their parents — who don't so much as hold hands — have done that!
No Kissing, No Telling
Just like in Hindi the word pappi evokes kiddish non-sexual images, the words oomma and muttham for kiss in Mallu-land only conjure up benign pure exchanges between grandmas and grandsons or a college girl and a love letter she receives. Lips are mobilized for the noble act of hawking or spitting, but never to snog, buss or steal a kiss!
When Hrithik kissed Aishwarya in Dhoom, it may have made the Censor Board swoon, but the average moviegoer remained unmoved. 'Like brother and sister kissing,' they pronounced. Emraan Hashmi singlemouthedly fought the good fight but a soul-stirring pulse-racing effect that is mindful of aesthetics while maintaining believable chemistry continues to elude Bollywood. Malayalam films, however, haven't even joined the celluloid-kiss queue, resorting instead to back shots of heads, where the hero and heroine seem painfully glued at the nose from a distance, like they died at first sniff.
Blissful in its Dubai bling and pastry-shaped bungalows, Kerala asked nothing more of matrimony than someone to go to church/temple with. But the latest controversy has separated pro-kissers from anti-kissers. To kiss or not to kiss: this was the dilemma Kochiites faced. A viral dilemma, infecting Hyderabad and Kolkata and God knows how many more states and cities and people and mouths.
The kisses were a war cry against the Bharatiya Yuva Morcha which attacked a Kozhikode eatery for 'immoral' activity. The anti-kissing drive got secular with different religions coming together to tut-tut; the Hindu Shiv Sena , ABVP and Bajrang Dal joined hands with the Muslim SYS and Social Democratic Party of India.
Until such time the two warring sides kiss and make up, Kerala will remain a Sleeping Beauty waiting for the kiss of true love.

(Activists of the women wing…)
GHAZIABAD: Activists of the women wing of BJP today held a protest here against the SP government in Uttar Pradesh over the "deteriorating" law and order condition in the state.
Workers of BJP Mahila Morcha staged a demonstration at the Shastri Nagar Crossing and burnt an effigy of the Uttar Pradesh government while shouting slogans against it.
"The condition of law and order is deteriorating in the state. Traders are facing troubles and feeling insecure. Kidnapping and extortion cases are increasing day by day," alleged State Secretary of the wing Archna Singh.
"Women are not safe neither on the roads nor at home. There is anarchy in the state and the government is helpless before criminals and mafias," she alleged.

(Haruki Murakami sent…)
TOKYO: Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami sent a message of support to Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters likening their struggle to the fight to bring down the Berlin Wall as he collected a prize in the German capital.
Murakami was speaking in Berlin after being awarded the Welt-Literaturpreis by leading German newspaper Die Welt yesterday on the eve of celebrations marking 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The author spoke of his own memories of the wall that divided East from West Germany and attributed ongoing conflicts throughout the world - including protests in Hong Kong and violence in Gaza - to a system of walls that drive people apart, Kyodo News agency reported.
"I'd like to send this message to the young people in Hong Kong who are struggling against their wall right now at this moment," he was quoted as saying.
Murakami, one of Japan's best known writers who has repeatedly been tipped as a future Nobel Literature laureate, said it was the task of novelists to help readers pass through these walls, and that harnessing the power of each person's imagination "could be the starting point of something".
"We can see (a world without walls) with our own eyes - we can even touch it with our own hands if we try hard."
Beijing has been left grappling with one of the biggest challenges to its control over the semi-autonomous city at a time when the Communist Party is cracking down hard on dissent on the mainland.
The demonstrations, the worst civil unrest Hong Kong has experienced since its 1997 handover from British rule, were sparked by Beijing's decision in August to restrict who can stand for the city's top post.
Publicity-shy Murakami, 65, is the first Japanese author to win the Berlin-based prize since it was established in 1999, reports said.
When he received the 2009 Jerusalem Prize, Israel's highest literary honour for foreign writers, he obliquely criticised authoritarian systems in the Middle East for claiming the lives of innocent civilians.
In an interview published earlier this month, he also chided his own country for shirking responsibility for its World War II aggression and the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
Murakami's latest novel "Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage" was released in Europe and the United States earlier this year.

Surprise investor financing for Kalyan Jewellers and Mindhelix lifts hopes of Kerala entrepreneurs
S Sanandakumar, ET Bureau Nov 9, 2014, 03.00AM IST

(Financial analysts said…)
Kerala maybe God's Own Country, but it has long been a Godforsaken Country for investors. It's not hard to see why. The state barely has an industry of note owing to fervent unionism. So the news of investments in two Kerala companies that are as different as chalk and cheese and at two ends of the entrepreneurial journey to boot, caused not only surprise, but has also raised hope that investors are finally looking at companies from the state in a positive light.
Kalyan Jewellers, one of the largest jewellery retailing units in India, has received financing worth Rs 1,200 crore from private equity giant Warburg Pincus. The investment in the 21-yearold company is one of the largest instances of funding in the jewellery sector in the region. Almost simultaneously, Mindhelix, a startup launched by a bunch of students, raised nearly $1,19,000 (around Rs 73 lakh) through crowdfunding for its home security innovation. The company had set a target of $100,000, but ended up collecting more.
Newfound Faith
Financial analysts said investors, domestic and global, seem to be reposing faith in the potential of the companies in Kerala. Investment consultant and fund manager Porinju Veliyath said many of his friends from other states called up to find out whether the news (of the twin financing) was true.
That's not to say instances of companies receiving money from investors or of raising funds from the market have been rare in Kerala. Catholic Syrian Bank, based in Thrissur, hogged headlines when Thailand-based businessman Surachan Chansrichawala became the largest shareholder. A number of Kerala companies have also tapped the capital market through successful IPOs. PE investors too have been active. For example, New Vernon Investment, based in the US, invested $10 million in Kochi spices company Eastern Condiments, General Atlantic of the US pumped $60 million in Thiruvananthapurambased travel and logistics IT company IBS Software and Baring India put $35 million in financial services company JRG Securities, based in Kochi. But these investments happened nearly a decade ago.
In that context, The Warburg Pincus investment in Kalyan Jewellers has the potential to trigger a fresh wave of interest in companies in Kerala. Veliyath, CEO of Equity Intelligence, a Kochi-based portfolio management company, said companies from the state are being watched with renewed interest. A lot of money is floating around and companies here are bracing to expand, he said, adding that labour unrest, the bugbear of enterprises in Kerala, is now a thing of the past.
Winds of Change
B Girirajan, managing director, Bhima Jewellers, said the investment in Kalyan Jewellers is a signal that the global investors have taken note of the retail prowess of jewellery majors in the state.
Kalyan will use the Rs 1,200-crore investment largely for expansion. For a state where jewellery shops are as common as coconut trees, the company was a pioneer in embracing the concept of large showrooms with lush interiors. Apart from an emphasis on customer service, the company also focused on offering a wide choice of jewellery to customers, according to Kalyan Jewellers chairman TS Kalyanaraman.
Today, Kalyan has 55 exclusive showrooms in India and six in the UAE. The company is about to add 28 showrooms in six months. This includes a further foray in West Asian markets such as Kuwait and Qatar and to South East Asian markets such as Malaysia and Singapore. The expansion is expected to boost the company's revenues to Rs 25,000 crore in three years from Rs 10,000 crore at present, according to the promoters. Kalyanaraman, the only businessman in Kerala to own a private jet and helicopter, which facilitate his visits to showrooms spread across the country, has acquired a second aircraft from Brazil.
Kalyan's ambitions are also a cue for jewellery rivals like Bhima to expand operations. "We have to invest in showrooms and widen our network," Girirajan said. Bhima is preparing to infuse fresh capital from investors in West Asia, he said.
 
Different Direction
Being a startup, the ambitions of Mindhelix are modest in comparison, but the company's founders are no less excited. The company raised $1,19,000 two days before the closing date of fund-raising. Mindhelix's home security sensor-equipped hardware, Rico, works by itself or with a spare smartphone to detect and alert users about changes inside a home, including temperature, smoke and cooking gas. Thanks to the device, users can watch live video feeds of the rooms and control home appliances. According to Mindhelix CEO Kallidil Kalidasan, Rico is a cheaper and smarter replacement for heavy and expensive home security hardware. It will also allow people to reuse their discarded smartphones, he added.

Entrepreneur Rajesh Agrawal launches unique remittance service(India-born Rajesh Agrawal…)
LONDON: A London-based Indian-origin entrepreneur has launched a unique "pay-what-you-want" money remittance service that abolishes compulsory fees.
India-born Rajesh Agrawal believes his Xendpay online platform will save customers in the developing world £60 million over the next five years.
India is the largest recipient of remittances in the world, with USD 71 billion sent last year. World Bank figures show global migrants last year sent home 250 billion pounds in remittances to developing countries - with an eight per cent increase predicted for 2014.
"It is a social imperative that the cost of sending money abroad is significantly reduced," said Agrawal, who announced the launch here this week.
"The remittance industry takes far more than it needs to in profit and in doing so drains away a lot of money that would otherwise reach those in developing nations. By launching a no fees, best rate transfer service I hope to challenge and change this," he added.
Under the Xendpay model, customers can send anything from 1 to 100,000 pounds and will be asked to "tip" what they want for the service - even if it's nothing - and will also be given the best exchange rates usually reserved for multinational corporations.
"I set up Xendpay not to be the biggest or to make money but to make money transfer better and cheaper. I believe people will recognise the value in what we are doing both financially and socially and that as a result the discretionary 'tips' model will work," explains Agrawal.
The Xendpay model has been accepted as a Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Commitment to Action, with an objective to save people sending money through the platform. Established by Bill Clinton in 2005, the CGI convenes global leaders to create and implement innovative solutions to the world's most pressing challenges.
Xendpay is part of the Rational Group of companies, which offers low-cost money transfer services which has made transfers worth over USD 5 billion of transfers since inception in 2005.

Karnataka's 70% jobs quota for locals faces criticism; phenomenon not limited to the state

("Job quotas are economic…)
Volvo Trucks India's 16-year-old plant at Hoskote near Bengaluru is only about 50 km from the border-town of Hosur in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. So naturally the plant has quite a few Tamil workers who have never really given much thought to that identity of theirs.
Even when there have been minor scuffles between Kannadigas and Tamilians nearby, the workers have just gone about their business. But now an industrial policy announced by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in Karnataka, in what is clearly a case of vote-bank politics, has got them worried.
According to the policy, which was approved in September, for every new public sector or private industrial unit to avail of government sops related to land, water and the like, Kannadigas have to comprise 70% of the employees on an overall basis and 100% at the Group D level, which includes, among others, security and housekeeping personnel.
"Are we now making countries out of states within India?" asks a puzzled and distraught Tamil employee at the Volvo plant, requesting anonymity. "Your talent won't be rewarded if you just stay in your state. I will move to Mumbai or Delhi if I get a good job there and no one should stop me," adds the 30-year-old, who has worked on the shop floor at the plant for over six years.
Nagaraj Mariyani, a Kannadiga technician with Harihar Polyfibers & Grasilene Division at Kumarapatnam, about 300 km from Bengaluru, does not agree. "When there are two equally qualified people, the local should get the job. Ability or merit must be the main consideration, but the government also needs to consider the well-being of Karnataka's people when they take such a decision," he says. Harihar is a unit of Grasim, an Aditya Birla Group company which makes cement and viscose staple fibre.
K Shivappa, a senior executive in the administration department at JK Tyre's plant in Mysore, concurs with Mariyani. "In the past, meritorious locals have lost out due to castebased reservation (in government jobs), so the state needs to move towards a merit-based system of appointments," he says, while adding that it is going to be difficult for the government to enforce reservation. The government has said it will track implementation of the policy for five years.
  India Inc Not Pleased
The state government has not stated who will be considered a Kannadiga. But it is likely that only those who have lived in Karnataka for at least 15 years and can speak, read and write Kannada reasonably well will qualify as Kannadigas.
This definition was used by the committee headed by former union minister Sarojini Mahishi. The committee, which submitted its report in 1986, recommended a slew of quotas for Kannadigas, including 65-100% in state and central government departments and public sector units, and all jobs in the private sector except in senior and skilled positions. This is not the first time the state government has introduced such a policy.
Earlier, there was an 80% quota for locals but it was not monitored. K Ratna Prabha, additional chief secretary, commerce and industry, Karnataka, says the pressure for jobs has been increasing, and the government is no longer in a position to give jobs. "So we have dovetailed reservation for Kannadigas in our industrial policy to ensure local Kannadiga youth are employed by industries to which the government is giving incentives and concessions," she notes.
The corporate sector, expectedly, is not pleased with the new policy. Shekar Viswanathan, vice-chairman, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, says quotas such as this do a disservice to the locals because companies quite often export the local talent to other parts of India or the world to help them gain exposure.
"So, instead of being rigid about the percentages, the government should see whether we are broadly compliant with the spirit behind employing local people. We are here to ensure that the best people get employed, and it is in our own interest that we employ locals," he adds.
VJK Nair, Karnataka state president of Centre of Indian Trade Unions, which opposed the Sarojini Mahishi Committee report, says recruitment is the company management's prerogative: "The process will become corrupt if we have these quotas. You should consider the employability of the labour that is available to you."
TV Mohandas Pai, former HR head of Infosys and now chairman of Manipal Global Education Services, believes there are more jobs than people available to do them in some sectors.
"The garment industry itself is short of two lakh skilled workers while the security industry needs one lakh more people. Investors as well as workers will stop coming to our state (Karnataka) if the government starts harassing them like this," he observes.

Now  NET score to serve as passport to jobs in PSUsNow, NET score to serve as passport to jobs in PSUs

Save precious time tracking your investments
PATNA: The National Eligibility Test (NET) conducted by the UGC for the award of research fellowships and also for the appointment of assistant professors in the institutions of higher education in the country will now also serve as a passport to lucrative jobs in the public sector undertakings (PSUs). The UGC has decided to grant permission to PSUs to use its NET result database for recruitment of master's degree holders as their officers.
Patna University (PU) pro-vice-chancellor Ranjit Kumar Verma, who has been pursuing this matter with the UGC for the last one year, told TOI here on Friday that now PSUs can utilize UGC-NET score for recruitment of executives in their organizations in disciplines like science (R & D), management, corporate communications, human resources, finance, etc. With this, the craze for taking the UGC-NET examination would increase manifold in our country and, in return, the universities shall be getting better students for their PhD programmes, Verma said.
He said the UGC gave its final nod to this proposal last week after its approval by its chairman. The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) has even issued an advertisement inviting applications from NET successful candidates. It shall rely on the score obtained by candidates at the NET examination.
It may be mentioned here that the IOCL has introduced the practice of recruiting graduate engineers through GATE scores and also that of law graduates through CLAT score. It has been utilizing score from GATE examination for last three years starting from 2010. In 2012 itself, the number of applicants in GATE increased to about 4.5 lakh from about 1.5 lakh in 2009.
In 2013, over 11 lakh candidates reportedly registered for GATE. After the IOCL, a large number of other reputed PSUs like NTPC , BHEL , DVC etc have started utilizing GATE score. They are enthusiastic as their recruitment process shall become more objective by utilizing scores from highly reputed and standard examinations like the NET conducted by UGC at multiple locations across India, Verma said.

Rabi sowing off to a slow start as wheat coverage trailsRabi sowing off to a slow start as wheat coverage trails
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, November 7:  
If one were to go by early rabi sowing trends, then oilseeds coverage may be higher this year.
But sowing in wheat and pulses are on at a slower pace. According to data from the Ministry of Agriculture, the area under oilseeds is higher at 31.36 lakh hectares (lh) against 28.41 lh during the corresponding period a year ago.
Rapeseed-mustard is the main oilseed during the Rabi season.
Coverage of wheat, the main cereal crop in the rabi season, is lagging behind. So far, 4.47 lh have been covered compared against 9.39 lh in the year-ago period.
The lower acreage can be attributed to problems sugarcane farmers are facing in Uttar Pradesh. With sugarcane crushing being delayed in the northern State, farmers have no option but to delay its harvest and in turn, postpone wheat sowing.
Pulses sowing is also slack with 23.98 lh being covered till now against 30.86 lh year ago. Coverage of gram or chana, the main rabi pulses crop, is down at 16.15 lh against 23.78 lh.
Review meeting
Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh held a review meeting in Mumbai on Friday with officials of State Agriculture and Animal Husbandry departments.
Officials were asked to provide soil health cards to all farmers over the next three years and also called upon scientists to adopt villages to effectively monitor extension activities. The Minister also suggested the establishment of a cow sanctuary project in Maharashtra along the lines of the one in Madhya Pradesh.

Govt in final stages of discussions with states on GST: FM Arun JaitleyNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Hinting that amendments to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) may be introduced in the ensuing Winter session of Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said the government was in the final stages of talks with states on the issue.
“I am in the last stage of my discussion with the states on the eve of Parliament session before introducing the amendments to the GST law in Parliament,” Jaitley said at the India Global Forum meeting here.
The month-long Winter Session of Parliament is scheduled to commence on November 24.
Seeking support from the opposition parties, especially Congress, in passing the key legislation, Jaitley said they should realise that the “merits of some of these actions have positive attitude towards them”.
“I do hope that my friends in the Opposition parties, particularly the principle Opposition, after a wasted opportunity when they were in government, spend a more fruitful tenure when they are in opposition,” Jaitley said.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime aims at subsuming most of the indirect taxes at the central as well as state level. The UPA government in 2011 introduced a Constitution Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha to pave the way for introduction of GST.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.
Pending since 2006, the discussion on GST Bill is stuck at a crucial stage where states have proposed to keep products such as petroleum, tobacco and alcohol out of GST ambit and had demanded the exemption list be included in the Constitutional Amendment Bill.
Talking about reforms, Jaitley said some are possible with a consensus and some others are more challenging.
“I have always believed that some reforms are easily possible … I have clearly prioritised most of them… For next few months we have our plates reasonably full,” he said.
Clearance of CST compensation arrears has been a bone of contention between Centre and states, as the states still wait for Rs 13,000 crore arrears pending till 2010.
As regards the compensation structure, the states have sought a five-year compensation mechanism from the Centre and demanded the same be included in the Constitutional Amendment Bill.
CST, a tax imposed on the inter-state movement of goods, was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in 2007-08 and further to 2 per cent in 2008-09 after the introduction of Value-Added Tax (VAT). The Centre had then promised the states that it would bear losses due to reduction of CST.
As part of the roll-out of GST, the CST is being phased out and has been reduced to two per cent from the earlier four per cent. The Centre collects CST and distributes it among states.
While presenting the Budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had expressed hope that the government would be able to “bring a final solution in the course of this year and approve the legislative scheme which enables introduction of GST”.
GST, he had said, would streamline tax administration and avoid harassment of business and result in higher tax collection both for Centre and states.

Microsoft Corporation to launch first non-Nokia Lumia phone on Nov 11Editorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Months after closing its $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia’s handset unit, tech giant Microsoft Corporation is expected to launch the first non-Nokia branded Lumia smartphone on November 11.
In a teaser on its Conversations blog, Microsoft today said: “Microsoft is delivering the power of everyday mobile technology to everyone. Come back on November 11, to find out more!”
It includes teaser shots on the look of the device without disclosing the features.
Reports suggest that the new handset would feature the Microsoft logo, 5-inch display, 1.2GHz processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB storage.
Last month, Microsoft had confirmed that it plans to do away with the Nokia brand on Windows Phone-based devices.
“We are looking forward to unveiling a Microsoft Lumia device soon. This is of course a natural progression as all devices that once came from Nokia now come from Microsoft,” Microsoft Senior Vice President of Marketing for Phones Tuula Rytila had said.

The devices are priced at Rs 44,000 and Rs 28,900 onwards, respectively.
Developed by US-based Motorola, Nexus 6 was launched globally last month, along with Nexus 9, which was developed by Taiwanese major HTC.
Nexus 6 has been listed on Google’s Play Store for Rs 44,000 (32 GB), while the 64 GB variant will be available for Rs 49,000.
The 16 GB Wi-Fi variant of Nexus 9 will be priced at Rs 28,900, while the 32 GB LTE version will be available for Rs 44,900.

In Gazprom deal  JPMorgan Chase takes on business that some banks fearEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
When JPMorgan Chase & Co  agreed to lead a $700 million bond offering for Russian gas producer Gazprom OAO, it was doing business that some U.S. banks are afraid to do, several lawyers and a banker said.
Gazprom faces U.S. sanctions after the U.S. government widened its restrictions against Russia in September. U.S. companies are prohibited from providing goods or technology to Gazprom and others, although they can provide financial services to the companies, meaning JPMorgan obeyed the law in underwriting bonds for the company. Gazprom announced pricing for the deal on Thursday.
Peter Kucik, a former U.S. Treasury official who left the department in March, said generally short-term transactions, such as underwriting bonds, should not be a problem. But he said U.S. companies need to be careful in conducting long-term business with Russian firms or banks, since sanctions could always get tougher in the future.
Some U.S. bankers would hesitate to do the business, fearing that even if it is legal, it will look bad to regulators.
“Our relationship with regulators is so important. We would not want to make them mad,” said a capital markets banker at a rival firm. “No one would touch it with a 10-foot pole here.”
Some banks’ hesitance to underwrite these sorts of bonds underscores the frostiness in relations between banks and their regulators since the financial crisis. Big banks globally face much tighter restrictions on their activity after the financial crisis of 2008 and have paid tens of billions of dollars in fines for violations over the past few years.
One lawyer who works extensively with sanctions matters said his clients are “skittish,” and are reluctant to expend the effort to determine whether, for example, underwriting bonds for Gazprom’s would be legal.
“They just won’t do business with the entities that are listed in those sanctions, even if it is legal,” the lawyer said.
It is not clear exactly what JPMorgan did in this case, but the bank often checks in with regulators in advance of potentially sensitive assignments, such as through a phone call seeking an unofficial consent, a person familiar with the matter said.
Doing the deal could help JPMorgan cement its relationship with Gazprom, a company that the bank has worked with extensively in the past.
The U.S. sanctions against Russia are meant to be surgical, focusing on particular people, sectors, and businesses, lawyers who work with the sanctions said.

Twitter to set up shop in Hong KongEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Twitter plans to set up shop in Hong Kong early next year, focusing on ad sales instead of the one-to-many messaging service banned in China.
The San Francisco-based service that has served as a platform for dissent and free speech wants to tap into booming growth in Greater China by selling ads to businesses such as exporters.
US Internet titans Google and Facebook already have similar strategies in place.
“We are not entering China, we’re still blocked there,” Twitter told AFP today.
“With half of all Internet, mobile and social media users worldwide in Asia today, we see many opportunities across the region.”
Through the new office, Twitter will target Hong Kong and Taiwan advertising markets while establishing partnerships and promoting its new Fabric platform for developers to weave the service into applications made for smartphones or tablets.
Twitter has offices in Singapore, Seoul, Tokyo and Sydney. Earlier this year, the company announced it will open an office in Jakarta.
“Just like Indonesia, Greater China is an important market for us to tap into for our next phase of growth across Asia Pacific,” Twitter said.
The company referred to the Asian-Pacific area as “the growth engine for the company.”
Twitter has been under pressure to ramp up use of the service along with revenue.
Earnings figures showed that the number of people using Twitter monthly climbed 23 per cent to 284 million in the third quarter of this year. More than three quarters of Twitter users reside outside the United States.
Total revenue in the quarter more than doubled to USD 361 million, but the United States accounted for about two-thirds of the money brought in, according to Twitter.

Xi Jinping jumps up in Forbes rankings of power leadersEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Emerging as the most powerful Chinese leader after Mao Zedong, President Xi Jinping was ranked as the third most powerful person in the world by Forbes magazine this year jumping up from the last year’s ninth position.
Russian President Vladimir Putin bagged the first slot for his tough policy towards Ukraine followed his US counterpart Barack Obama.
Xi’s third rank this year is a big jump from last year’s ninth position though his predecessor Hu Jintao got the first slot in 2010 Forbes list.
Chinese analysts believe Xi’s ranking on the list reflects the expanding influence of China over the Western world.
“For a US magazine which evaluates the world’s power players according to Western values, Xi’s high ranking reflects Xi’s prestige. China’s rapid development also makes his listing inevitable,” Cai Zhiqiang, a professor of Party building with the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, told state-run Global Times.
Considered the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao, the Forbes’ report said Xi is the country’s leader, the head of its Communist Party and its military since taking office two years ago.
It also said that Xi is currently leading an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign in China, as well as reforms in Chinese market economy and judicial system.
Into the second year of his office, Xi has already acquired the image of a tough leader virtually overshadowing all other top party officials in the collective leadership.
Cai said that China has reached a critical stage in its development, facing challenges of unsolved problems accumulated over the past 30 years of China’s reform and opening-up policies.
“What Xi is doing is of great importance,” he added.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang joins Xi on the list in 13th spot.

Dr Reddys rises to record on US FDA nod for genericValcyteFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Dr Reddy’s Laboratories closed at a record high of Rs 3,397.15 on the BSE on Friday, up 4.42% from the previous close, the highest single-day gain since July 2013.
The stock climbed as much as 6.2% intra-day, on the back of the company receiving US FDA approval for a generic version of antiviral drug Valcyte. The scrip has closed higher on each of the last five trading sessions, having gained 12% during the period.
The announcement of the US FDA approval comes a day after Ranbaxy Laboratories said it has lost its 180-day marketing exclusivity on the drug after the US regulator withdrew the previously-granted tentative approval. A Dr Reddy’s spokesperson confirmed that the launch was expected shortly, but did not specify the dosages for which the approval was received or whether it had marketing exclusivity in the US.
Reuters reported US FDA as saying on Friday that there were no companies with such sales exclusivity for Valcyte generic anymore.
Bloomberg Intelligence pegs Valcyte US sales for CY13 at $388.04 million. Ranbaxy said on Thursday that the US FDA had withdrawn tentative approval for two drugs, Valcyte and acid-reflux blockbuster therapy Nexium.
So far in 2014, the stock has generated a return of 34.11% against the benchmark Sensex return of 32%.
In the last 12 trading sessions, top five BFSI firms have collectively added close to 851 points to Sensex’s 1,917-point ascent since October 17, 2014. This represents a near 45% contribution to gains in the 30-share benchmark. The country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), gained 2.2% on Wednesday to close at R2,782.25 — the highest in three-and-a-half years. ICICI Bank, India’s largest private sector lender, and HDFC, the largest bank by market capitalisation, ended at historic highs.
Analysts said growing expectations of rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) at the next policy review have backed the recent rally as has the growing interest of foreign portfolio (FPI) investors in banking stocks. Overseas investors are betting BFSI stocks to be at the heart of the market rally. A pick-up in credit growth will play a pivotal role in an up-turn in economic growth that is envisioned by the government, they said. Credit growth has recovered to 11.16% after a hitting a decade low of 9.7%. Banks are targeting a credit growth of 12-15% for full-year FY15.
The inclination towards banking shares was also seen replicated in the previous two rallies in May 2014 and August-September 2014, when banking stocks contributed about 25-40% at a time when benchmark indices surged more than 7% in a span of 12-19 days. Between May 8 and 23, the Sensex had gained 2,369 points, or 11%. SBI had contributed more with 260 points, followed by ICICI Bank with 248 points. All the banking stocks have outperformed the Sensex so far this year with a return ranging between 37-76%. The Sensex gained 32% in the same period. On Wednesday, the BSE Bankex closed at record high 19,872.26, up 1.41%. Axis Bank was the top performer in the sector with 2.93% gains, followed by SBI. Among the banking stocks, Axis Bank gained the most with 76% return in CY14.

Sensex takes a breather after heady rally ahead of keydataFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Benchmark indices ended flat-to-positive in a holiday-shortened week after gaining more than 7% since the week ended October 17 as investors refrained from placing big bets ahead of key economic data.
The street is keenly awaiting the monthly industrial output and retail inflation (CPI) data on Wednesday, and the wholesale price inflation (WPI) numbers on Friday.
Sensex ended the week higher by 2.8 points, or 0.01%, from the previous week at 27,868.63. The 30-share gauge touched the psychological mark of 28,000 on Wednesday. The 50-share Nifty ended higher by 0.17% (14.8 points) at 8,337. There were two trading holidays in the week — Muharram and Guru Nanak Jayanti.
Broader markets outperformed the benchmark indices, given the valuations comfort. The BSE Mid-Cap and Small-Cap indices each rose 1.7% from the previous week. The Mid-Cap index is still below its all-time highs of early 2008 and trades at 13.5 times earnings compared to about 19 times for the Sensex.
Overseas funds remained net buyers of Indian equities for the sixth consecutive session on Friday. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) purchased about $418.37 million of shares in the cash segment on Friday — the biggest single-day purchase since July 3. FPIs have now purchased close to $1.5 billion in the last six sessions.
Foreign funds, who have been driving the Indian markets for over a decade, have invested close to $14.8 billion so far this year — the most among eight Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. The purchases have helped the Sensex climb 32% this year, the best performance among the world’s 40 biggest markets.
Real estate and pharmaceutical stocks were in focus this week. The BSE Realty index was the top performer with 5.7% gains. The BSE Healthcare index advanced 3.7% from the previous week.
Dr Reddy’s Laboratories rallied 4.42% — the biggest single-day gain since July this year — to a record as the company received USFDA approval for generic version of antiviral drug Valcyte. Dr Reddy’s has gained more than 12% in the last five sessions.
Realty major DLF surged 6.3% after an appeals court granted interim relief to the Gurgaon-based company to redeem mutual funds worth R1,800 crore for repayment of loans.
Hero MotoCorp declined 2.6% on Friday, taking this week’s loss to 5.8%, after PE firm Bain Capital was said to have sold shares in the motorcycle maker. Mahindra & Mahindra fell more than 1%. HDFC Bank declined 1.5%, while SBI slid 1.4%.
Ashok Leyland gained 1.5% after the company’s second-quarter profit of R121 crore exceeded the median analyst estimate of R20.5 crore.
Sixteen of the 20 Sensex members that have declared results so far have beaten or matched estimates. Earnings of companies on the gauge are likely to expand 23% over the next 12 months vs 15% for companies on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

FPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
We maintain ‘outperform’ on Oil India (OIL) with a revised target price of R773 per share (earlier R670) based on 9x FY16e P/E (from 10x) post lower subsidy assumptions. We think implementation of the transparent sharing mechanism will be a stock re-rating catalyst. Onshore royalty uncertainty is a major concern, as it affects OIL’s entire crude volume and could reduce FY16e earnings by 14%. However, the earnings risk on this count reduces with expected lower subsidy per barrel and gets offset by attractive valuation of 7.3x FY16e P/E.
We have revised FY15e/16e EPS by 11%/28% to factor in lower subsidy at $45/34 per barrel (from $56 per barrel). The FY15-17e estimates factor in upstream sharing of 60% of gross under-recoveries for OIL, more conservative than the graded realisation using the Kirit Parikh formula. We trim gas realisation to $5.6 per mmBtu for FY16e/17e after the government announcement.
Our sensitivity analysis across crude price levels of $80-120 per barrel suggests OIL’s FY16e earnings are more leveraged to lower oil subsidy discounts than ONGC’s and more resilient at lower oil prices. OIL’s mean EPS in the analysis was in line with its base-case FY16e EPS of R85.9.
Production will likely recover after a sluggish FY14 in which strikes hurt volumes.

Reduce GSK Consumer on below parQ2FPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
We maintain ‘reduce’ rating on GSK Consumer Healthcare and target price of R4,097 per share. We value the core operating business at 25x one-year forward EPS of R146.4, which gives a value of R3,660. As at the end of FY14, the company had cash of R18.4 billion, which works out to R437 per share.
GSK Consumer reported Q2FY15 results which were below our and street expectations. While sales were 1.3% below our estimates, PAT was 3.1% below our and 2.1% below street estimates. Net sales increased 10.6% to R1075 crore against our expectation of R1089 crore and street expectations of R10.98 crore. Ebitda came in at R196 crore versus our estimate of R216 crore and the street at R197 crore.
Consolidated gross margin declined 155 bps to 62.9% versus our estimate of 50 bps y-o-y improvement. Ebitda margin came in at 18.2%, down 155 bps y-o-y. We were expecting ebitda margins at 19.8% (flat y-o-y) and the street was at 17.9%. PAT came in at R160 crore against our expectation of R165 croren and the street at R1.64 crore. The key saving grace was higher-than-expected non-operating other income.
Volume growth continues to remain soft and below the long-term average. We estimate that for the quarter volume growth has continued to remain in the low single digit range versus long-term average of 11%. Margins also continue to be under pressure both at the gross and ebitda level which is another negative.

The worlds best ScotchEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Every year, lovers of Scotch and single malts eagerly await the publication of Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible. It is widely considered the world’s leading whisky guide. Each edition contains roughly 4,500 professionally-analysed tasting notes on the world’s leading and lesser-known whiskies. The 2015 edition is just out and it has left Scottish distilleries with eggnogg on their faces. For the first time, the top five rankings feature not a single Scottish brand. Instead, Murray has named a Japanese whisky, the Yamazaki Single Malt, as the best in the world. The Yamazaki is from Japan’s oldest distillery (1923) and was given 97.5 marks out of 100. Murray described the drink as a work of ‘near genius’, extolling its ‘nose of exquisite boldness’ and finish of ‘light, teasing spice’. Murray, an English journalist, has been writing about whisky for years and his bible is now in its 12th edition, known for its extensive research and the range it covers.
The 2015 edition contains over 1,000 new entries. Indeed, the bible shows how far the Japanese single malt and whisky industry has progressed. The country’s whiskies have won a slew of awards and widespread critical acclaim in recent years. To rub salt into Scotland’s wounds, the second-ranked whisky was from America: the William Larue Weller 2013 bourbon made by Buffalo Trace Distillery in Kentucky, which has sold out all its stock. The best European whisky of the year went to a British brand, Chapter 14 Not Peated, from the English Whisky Company. Even the best Scotch of the year went to Single Drop, a distillery that shut down some years ago, though its produce is still available.
Two of the last three editions of the bible have named Scotch whiskies as the best in the world—Old Pulteney’s 21-year-old single malt in 2012 and Glenmorangie Ealanta in 2014. Murray says this emergence of such high-quality overseas brands should be a ‘wake-up call’ for the Scottish industry, adding that the Yamazaki is ‘a single malt which no Scotch can at the moment get anywhere near’.
Murray said he had sampled hundreds of Scotch whiskies while tasting 4,700 varieties from around the world for his 2015 bible. Murray bemoans the lack of innovation in the present-day industry in Scotland. However, if you’re looking to pick up a bottle of the winning Yamazaki whisky, it may prove difficult. Only 18,000 bottles were made and are only sold in a few specialist shops for around £100 (R10,000 approx).
For connoisseurs of whisky, here’s the edited list:
2015 World Whisky of the Year:

Third Finest Whisky in the World: Sazerac Rye 18-year-old 2013

Parrikar  Rudy  Suresh Prabhu among those inductedArun Jaitley
(Four ministers were sworn-in…)
NEW DELHI: Former Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar and three others were today inducted into the Union Cabinet as Prime Minister Narendra Modi expanded his Council of Ministers, bringing in 21 new ministers as Shiv Sena kept away from the exercise.
Suresh Prabhu, a former Shiv Sainik and Power minister in Vajpayee government, senior BJP leader J P Nadda and Jat leader from Haryana Birender Singh, who joined BJP ahead of Assembly elections, were the other Cabinet ministers to take oath of office and secrecy at a function in the Rashtrapati Bhawan.
Unresolved issues between Sena and BJP in Maharashtra stopped Sena MP Anil Desai from taking oath as he reportedly returned to Mumbai from the airport after arriving here today morning.
Bandaru Dattatreya and Rajiv Pratap Rudy, who were ministers in the Vajpayee government, and Mahesh Sharma, newly-elected MP from Gautam Buddh Nagar bordering Delhi, were sworn-in as Ministers of State with Independent Charge.
14 other Ministers of State were sworn-in. They are Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Ram Kripal Yadav, Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, Sanwar Lal Jat and Mohanbhai Kalyanjibhai Kundariya Giriraj Singh, Hansraj Ahir, Ram Shankar Katheria, Jayant Sinha, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Babul Supriyo, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti and Vijay Sampla (all BJP) and Y S Chowdary, a Rajya Sabha member from TDP.
This is the first revamping exercise of his ministry undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi since he assumed power in May. Parrikar is all set to be given Defence portfolio, which was held as additional charge by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley .
The strength of the Union Council of Ministers goes up from 45 to 66. Of this, 27 including the Prime Minister are of Cabinet rank, 13 Ministers of State with Independent Charge and 26 Ministers of State.
The swearing-in ceremony was attended among others by Vice President Hamid Ansari, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairperson P J Kurien, Modi and his Cabinet colleagues, BJP patriarch L K Advani and the Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled states Vasundhara Raje, Raman Singh, Manohar Lal Khattar and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu of TDP. None from Congress was present in the ceremony.
Ahead of the swearing-in, the new ministers had a breakfast meeting with Modi at his Race Course residence.
An IIT graduate, 58-year-old Parrikar shares an excellent rapport with Modi and has a reputation for probity and administrative skills.
Prabhu also earned his reputation as a skillful operator and reformer as Power minister in Vajpayee government but was suddenly pulled out of the ministry by Shiv Sena. Ever since has has not been seen as an active Sainik.
Dattatreya's inclusion gives representation to the new Telangana state in the Union ministry while Rudy makes a comeback into the government. First-time MP Mahesh Sharma seems to be a surprise choice as a Minister of State with Independent Charge given the fact that Naqvi, a former minister, has been given just a Minister of State berth.
All the other Ministers of State are newcomers and first-time MPs except Yadav, who had been a Member of Parliament either of the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha having come from RJD in Bihar.
Here is the list of new ministers in Modi government:
Cabinet Ministers
2. Suresh Prabhu (Maharashtra, Shiv Sena)
3. J.P. Nadda (Himachal Pradesh, BJP)
4. Birender Singh (Haryana, BJP)

US  Iran seek nuclear breakthrough as deadline nearsPrint

By: Agence-France Presse | Muscat | Posted: November 9, 2014 4:25 pm
The United States and Iran began high-level talks in Oman today ahead of a looming deadline for a deal on Tehran’s nuclear programme, with both sides under pressure at home.
US Secretary of State John Kerry started a meeting with Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif to try to close substantial gaps before November 24, when an interim agreement is meant to be turned into a comprehensive long-term settlement.
The meeting follows the revelation that US President Barack Obama reportedly wrote to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to push for a deal, arguing the Islamic republic and the West have shared regional interests.
The apparent reference to the fight against Islamic State group militants in Syria and Iraq, however, was played down by Kerry in Beijing on Saturday, with the US diplomat saying “there is no linkage whatsoever” with the nuclear talks.
Despite the approaching deadline, Iran and the P5+1 group- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States plus Germany – are far apart on what capabilities Iran’s nuclear programme should have.
The West has as yet been unconvinced by Iran’s denials that it has never sought a nuclear weapon, while Tehran insists its atomic activities are for peaceful, civilian energy purposes only.
A deal, for the West, aims to put a bomb forever beyond Iran’s reach.
Kerry and Zarif began their talks at 11:30 am (local time), with former EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton also present.
At issue is the number of uranium-enriching centrifuges Iran should be allowed to keep spinning in exchange for sanctions relief and rigorous inspections at its nuclear sites.
Iran wants “industrial grade enrichment” beyond its current capabilities while the world powers want a reduction.
However, domestic politics were hanging heavily over the talks, given the loss in midterm elections of the Senate by Obama’s Democrats to the Republican party, members of whom have consistently bridled at the White House’s negotiations with Iran.
If talks go sour in the coming weeks it is thought the US Congress may respond with fresh sanctions on Iran.
Obama has the power to veto them, but the prospect of new penalties could disrupt an already protracted process.

Pilot-cum-politician Rajiv Pratap Rudy returns to governmentBJP
(52-year-old Rudy comes…)
NEW DELHI: A pilot-cum-politician, Rajiv Pratap Rudy returns to the Union Council of Ministers riding on BJP's success in the assembly polls in Maharastra after the articulate leader played a key role in the party's victory in the politically crucial state.
The induction of Rudy, who had humbled RJD chief Lalu Prasad's wife Rabri Devi in the recent Lok sabha elections in Bihar's Saran constituency, also signals BJP's focus on Bihar ahead of next year's assembly polls.
52-year-old Rudy comes from politically significant caste of Rajputs whose votes will be crucial for BJP in its aim to capture power in Bihar.
He was first made a Minister of state for Commerce and Industry in Atal Behari Vajpayee Ministry in 2001 and become Civil Aviation Minister with Independent Charge two years later.
As BJP General Secretary in-charge of Maharastra, Rudy had worked closely with party President Amit Shah and his induction into the Ministry is seen as a reward for his hardwork.
Rudy, who still holds a pilot's license and often flies commercial flights and has a formidable reputation as a party organiser, is one of the prominent faces on Television debates.
Born on March 30, 1962 in Chhapra, Rudy was a lecturer prior to entering politics and was involved in student politics while studying at Panjab University.
He was first elected in 1990 as an MLA to Bihar Legislative Assembly and then elected to the Lok Sabha in 1996. He was re-elected for a second term to the 13th Lok Sabha in 1999.
Rudy had earlier held the post of National Vice President of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.
In 2004, Rudy was embroiled in a controversy following allegation that he did not pay hotel bills for stay of his family in a Goa hotel and asked Airports Authority of India to pay them.
Rudy is married to Neelam Pratap and has two daughters.

NEW DELHI: A master-strategist and a trusted lieutenant of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as BJP President Amit Shah , Jagat Prakash Nadda's entry into the Government is a vindication of his efficiency and dependability who prefers to work behind the scenes.
A prominent student leader during his college days, mild-mannered Nadda, 53, known as a tough task master, was a strong contender for the post of BJP President but extended full support to Shah after losing out on the race earlier this year.
Nadda is seen as a member of the most powerful troika along with Modi and Shah. He is known to be part of all major decision making processes in the party and is likely to be the bridge between the party and the government.
He also enjoys support from the RSS and has good equations with all prominent leaders of the BJP.
Born on December 2, 1960 in Patna, Nadda has emerged as a very strong political figure from Himachal Pradesh in the last few years where he was an MLA before entering the Rajya Sabha.
Nadda was involved in student politics and became the active member of ABVP. He won the polls to become Secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad in Patna University in 1977. He had served ABVP for nearly 13 years from 1977-1990 and held various key positions.
At the age of 31, Nadda had become National President of BJP Yuva Morcha in 1991. He has been BJP's National General Secretary since May 2010.
His involvement with BJP from that young age has made him realize the importance of training at the grass root level. He also takes personality development and time management workshops for the party workers.
Nadda was member of Himachal Legislative Assembly from 1993-98, 1998-2003 and 2007-2012.
He served as Health Minister in the state from 1998-2003 and from 2008-2010, Minister of Forest and Environment, Science and Technology.
In April 2012, he was elected to Rajya Sabha and has been member of various Parliamentary Committees.
Nadda was inspired by the JP Movement and joined students politics. His father was a Vice Chancellor in Patna University.
He spent his youth in Bihar before moving to Himachal Pradesh.

MUMBAI: He is both feared and revered - Hansraj G. Ahir, the soft-spoken Lok Sabha member from Chandrapur in Vidarbha , can be persistent when it comes to exposing scams.
He blew the whistle on the coal mining scam and sought details on the various dark deals on it, but was stone-walled at various levels, including the then Prime Minister's Office.
But Ahir did not lose heart.
Currently in his fourth-term as Lok Sabha member, Ahir took help of Prakash Javadekar, another Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP, and moved the Central Vigilance Commission to inquire into the incident in early 2012.
A few months later, it was only after the CVC ordered a CBI inquiry into the scam that its ramifications came to light and it hit bigwigs in various sectors. Consequently, the UPA paid a heavy price in terms of the scam's political fallout.
The nation watched as the scam details with the staggering amounts involved tumbled out, and it catapulted into one of the biggest scams to hit the country's political-business landscape.
As in exposing scams, Ahir is equally meticulous and systematic in his parliamentary duties, bagging the Sansad Ratna Award for the Best Parliamentarian in the 15th Lok Sabha.

Sachin Tendulkar s autobiography  Playing It My Way  breaks pre-order subscriptions recordsEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Just as in his heyday Sachin Tendulkar kept breaking records almost every time he came out to bat, his autobiography ‘Playing It My Way’ has done the same.
The autobiography has broken all-time records for an adult hardback on pre-order subscriptions across both fiction and non-fiction categories.
On the day of release before sales began (at 11.30 am on 6th November) the book had topped 150,000 copies in orders, already pulling ahead of both pre-order and lifetime sales of the top hardbacks Dan Brown’s ‘Inferno’, Walter Issacson’s ‘Steve Jobs’ and JK Rowling’s ‘Casual Vacancy’.
“It is no surprise that the Master Blaster’s pen talks up records at the same pace as his bat. We’re delighted that he has now notched up a thousand hundreds on debut, and we’re sure that this innings has only just begun,” gushed Hachette India’s Managing Director Thomas Abraham.

Iraq investigating IS chief s fate after air strikesIslamic State jihadist group chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
By: Agence-France Presse | Baghdad | Posted: November 9, 2014 9:06 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 1:30 pm
Iraq was investigating whether Islamic State jihadist group chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in air strikes by US-led coalition warplanes targeting the group’s leaders.
The death of the elusive Baghdadi would be a major victory for the coalition of countries carrying out air strikes against IS and aiding Iraqi forces fighting to regain large areas of Iraq that the jihadists have overrun.
The announcement of the strikes came after President Barack Obama unveiled plans to send up to 1,500 more US troops to Iraq to advise and train the country’s forces, deepening Washington’s commitment to the open-ended war against IS.
“Until now, there is no accurate information available,” a senior Iraqi intelligence official said when asked about whether Baghdadi had been killed.
“The information is from unofficial sources and was not confirmed until now, and we are working on that,” the official said without specifying what the initial reports indicated.
US Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, yesterday said that coalition aircraft conducted a “series of air strikes” against “a gathering of (IS) leaders near Mosul”.
“We cannot confirm if (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present,” said Centcom spokesman Patrick Ryder.
The US-led strikes late Friday were a further sign of “the pressure we continue to place on the ISIL terrorist network,” he said, using another acronym for the Islamic State group.
The aim was to squeeze the group and ensure it had “increasingly limited freedom to manoeuvre, communicate and command”.
“I can’t absolutely confirm that Baghdadi has been killed,” General Nicholas Houghton, the chief of staff of the British armed forces, told BBC television on Sunday. “Probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation.”
Washington has offered a USD 10 million reward for his capture, and some analysts say he is increasingly seen as more powerful than Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Sena irked by Suresh Prabhu switching parties, no clarity from BJP on stance over NCP
Mumbai, November 9:  
Ties between the BJP and the Shiv Sena have moved dangerously close to the brink in the wake of the spat over Union Cabinet expansion and the BJP’s failure to accommodate the Sena in the Maharashtra Government.
The simmering tension between the parties came to a boil on Sunday as Sena MP Anil Desai, who had rushed to Delhi to join the Modi Cabinet, returned to Mumbai on orders of Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray.
Thackeray told mediapersons that till the Maharashtra picture gets clear, there is no point of having a Minister at the Centre.
Sena’s anger was also fuelled by Suresh Prabhu quitting the party and joining the BJP this morning before being inducted into the Cabinet.
With the two parties at loggerheads, the process of government formation in Maharashtra has become more complicated as the Sena has asked the BJP to clarify its position on taking the support of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for the Devendra Fadnavis Government. Thackeray said if the BJP seeks NCP’s support, then it will sit in the Opposition. Thackeray said the Sena wants a stable government in Maharashtra. For that, it is ready to support the BJP Government but not at the cost of the party’s self-esteem. The election of the Maharashtra Assembly Speaker is scheduled for Wednesday and the person should be acceptable to the Sena, he said. After that, the party will take a call whether or not to support the BJP Government.
“We want full clarity on our relationship with the BJP and we will not enter the Government by making any compromises on our principles. We are in no hurry or compulsion to enter the Government,” Thackeray said.
This brinkmanship has left the fate of Anant Geete, the lone Minister in the Modi Cabinet, hanging. Geete had tried in vain to meet the Prime Minister on Saturday night; he was then asked by the Sena leadership to return to Mumbai.

The new Defence Minister ‘designate’ will have to deal with influential nations, lobbies
New Delhi, November 9:  
The biggest challenge before Manohar Parrikar, tipped to be India’s new Defence Minister, will be to make the decision-making process quicker.
Defence projects and procurement involve dealing with influential countries and strong corporate lobbies, and the money at stake is huge. “Hope Parrikar doesn’t end up like his counterpart in the previous regime who refrained from taking strong decisions in order to protect his reputation,” said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified.
Lobby effect
But Parrikar is not new to dealing with corporate lobbies. As Goa Chief Minister, the 58-year-old has dealt with mining and liquor barons. The pressure as Defence Minister, however, is likely to be much more intense, especially with the Modi Government recently raising the FDI cap to 49 per cent.
Parrikar was expected to join the Modi Government from Day 1. But he had told BusinessLine earlier that he was happy in his own space.
‘Nation comes first’
On what changed in the past few months, Parrikar remained politically correct on Sunday, the day of his swearing-in as a Cabinet Minster, and only said: “The nation comes first.”
Parrikar, as the Defence Minister, is acceptable to most in the Government as he comes with strong technical backing – an IIT degree. Parrikar told BusinessLine that his approach will be to take quick decisions while taking stakeholders along to get fair results. “Defence is a technology driven sector, and a minister having sound footing on technical matters is an asset,” said a senior official.
Fast decision making is required as ‘equipment become obsolete fast’, said an official. Another challenge before the new minister will the issue of middlemen in defence deals.
Recently, the VVIP chopper deal had shown how powerful the lobbies are in the sector. While agents are banned from the sector, the fact remains that it has been dominated by four-five big players who call themselves consultants/agents and facilitate deals for foreign and domestic entities.
“Competition is such in defence procurement that big nations — the US, the EU, South Africa and Israel — are also very aggressive in lobbying for their companies,” another source said.
“It is a tough call for a minister.”

ICAR developing IT-based tool to forecast commodity pricesICAR developing IT-based tool to forecast commodity prices
K V Kurmanath
Tweet
Hyderabad, Nov 9:  
After weathermen, it is the turn of agricultural scientists and economists to utilise technological tools to forecast the prices of commodities before and after the two crop seasons of kharif and rabi. They are in the process of culling out data gathered by different government agencies for over a decade to indicate farmers what is in store for them if they grow this or that crop.
An expert associated with the project points out that this forecasting method would go a long way in equipping the farmers and policy makers to better plan the cropping patterns.
Market intelligence system
The country is in the process of formulating an IT-based solution to create a market intelligence system to forecast the prices. Sponsored by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Network Project on Market Intelligence (NPMI) will hold a national-level brainstorming meet on November 10 and 11 in New Delhi.
NPMI is focussing on developing marketing intelligence-based forecasting capabilities for Bengal gram, chilli, cotton, groundnut and maize.
The conference will review the progress of the project, being collaboratively taken up by different agricultural institutes across the country. The National Council for Agricultural Economics and Policy Research (NCAP) is coordinating the project as per the guidelines of the Planning Commission.
“We are using econometric analysis using different IT solutions, assessing the secondary data collected by different government agencies for about 12 years. We have taken the suggestions of traders too as we arrive at the forecast,” a senior official of Prof. Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University told BusinessLine.
“The price forecasts would be made four times in a year two for kharif (pre sowing and pre harvesting) and two for rabi. We will use media to disseminate the forecasts,” the official said.
Forecasts for kharif season
The university, which is forecasting prices for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, has just come out with its first set of forecasts for the kharif season. Forecasts made by different institutes across the country under the project will be discussed at the national conference.
The team has forecast a price of Rs 3,900-4,500 a quintal for groundnut, Rs 1,250-1,350 for maize and Rs 7,800-8,600 a quintal for chilli.

SBI Pharma Fund: BUYRiding on growth opportunities in pharma companies
November 9, 2014:  
After underperforming the market in early 2014, pharma stocks are now back in action. Pharma has been the best performing sector since the Modi-led Government took charge at the Centre. The BSE Healthcare Index has gained over 42 per cent in the past six months, while the Nifty Index rose a modest 17 per cent. Strong growth in key export markets such as the US — driven by product launches — a weak rupee and a recovery in the domestic market after a tepid show in 2013-14 due to implementation of the new pharma pricing policy have helped these companies clock spectacular growth in revenues and profits.
Generic drugs
Thanks to the generics opportunity in overseas markets, the prospects of drugmakers who have spread their operations across the globe, continue to remain healthy. With many large drug molecules expected to lose patent protection in the US over the next two years, Indian companies seeking approval for generic versions should continue to grow at a healthy pace. Investors with a three- to five-year investment horizon and a moderate risk appetite can consider parking a portion of their surplus in SBI Pharma Fund. The fund has outperformed its benchmark, the BSE Healthcare Index, across one-, three-, and five-year timeframes. It scores over its peers, Reliance Pharma and UTI Pharma, not just in absolute returns but also in consistency.
The fund’s one-year returns have been higher than its benchmark almost two-thirds of the time in the past five years. The fund got its biggest bet right. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, which was its top holding (24 per cent of the total assets), turned out to be the top gainer in the large-cap pharma space.
Good picks
Had you invested systematically in the fund, every month, over the past five years, your annual returns would have exceeded 30 per cent.
As of September, the fund held 16 stocks in its portfolio. Sun Pharma (24 per cent), Lupin (12 per cent) and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (11 per cent) are its top three holdings.

Modi Cabinet leaner than UPA and NDALetters to  the editor
The big expansion of his Council of Ministers by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today has taken the number of ministers to 66 but it is still leaner than those headed by Manmohan Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee before him.
The strength of Singh’s UPA ministry stood at 78 after its final reshuffle in October 2012 while the previous NDA government led by Vajpayee started with a lean 56-member ministry but was expanded up to nearly 88 ministers.
The Modi ministry has now 27 members, including the Prime Minister, of Cabinet rank, 13 Ministers of State with Independent Charge and and 26 Ministers of State.
Singh’s ministry had 33 ministers of Cabinet rank, 12 MoS with Independent Charge and 33 others as MoS.
The UPA-II government had started with 78 ministers but its strength went down following the withdrawal of support from TMC and death and resignation of some ministers. However, after the final reshuffle in October 2012, the cabinet was expanded to its original strength.
The Vajpayee government started with 26 ministers of Cabinet rank, eight MoS with Independent Charge and 22 MoS but its ranks swelled along the way to reach 88.

Snag grounds Air India s New York plane  London flight delayed tooEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Air India passengers bound to New York and London had a harrowing time at the city airport after the airline had to cancel the NY flight due to technical snag and duty time curbs on crew and the other flight because of a mock drill at the airport.
While a technical snag and duty time restrictions on cabin crew grounded AI-191 Mumbai-Newark flight yesterday, the Mumbai-London flight (AI-131) was delayed by nearly three hours due to the mock drill at the airport.
When contacted, Air India admitted to the delays and claimed that passengers had been taken care of.
“Yes, we had to cancel the AI-191 Mumbai-Newark flight with 191 passengers due to a technical snag yesterday. When the snag was rectified, the FDTL (flight duty time limit) of the cabin crew came into being and thus had to cancel the flight,” Air India said in a statement.
The airline further said out of the 191 passengers, 44 were provided hotel accommodation and the rest who came from Mumbai were given taxi fares. All of them were accommodated on today’s flight at 0130 hours which had full load of 303 passengers.
The passengers who came from Ahmedabad were sent to Delhi for the JFK flight which departed at 0200 hrs today from the national capital, the airline said.
As regards the delay of AI-131 Mumbai-London flight, the airline blamed it on the mock drill at the airport.
“Though the flight was ready for departure at 1400 hrs yesterday, it was delayed to 1620 hrs due to a mock drill by MIAL which lasted till 1530 hrs,” Air India said.
In the past few weeks, AI had been facing severe delays, so much so that the aviation ministry had to issue instructions to the national airline to improve its on-time performance.

1 mn bank accts  Rs 120 lakh crore black money abroad  says BJP s Subramanian SwamyNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Subramanian Swamy today expressed hope that the black money stashed in foreign banks would return to the country in about one year.
“We are optimistic that the black money stashed in foreign banks would return to the country in about one year time, much before the expectation of the people,” Swamy told reporters here.
Rejecting apprehension that the Centre was taking time on the matter of bringing black money back, Swamy said it was taking some time as about one million bank accounts have been opened by Indians in 70 odd countries.
About Rs 120 lakh crore were stashed in foreign banks, the senior BJP leader said.
On the National Herald case in which Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were named, Swamy said, “The Supreme Court in 2007 had given a direction to set up a special investigation team for the purpose. But, they did nothing till the NDA government came to the power.
“There has been an attempt to grab properties worth Rs 5,000 crore simply by forming a private limited company in the name of Young Indian Ltd by Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Motilal Vora and others,” Swamy said about the case initiated by him.
Stating that the paid off capital of the company was only Rs 5 lakh, Swamy alleged there had been fraud, breach of trust by manipulation.
“Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi own 76 per cent of the share on the private limited company,” he pointed out.
Swamy claimed that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, as majority shareholders of Young Indian Ltd (YIL), benefited from the acquisition of Associated Journals Ltd (AJL).

Bomber enters Kabul police HQ  targets chiefAfghan Police patrols near the site of a suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan on Sunday. (Source: AP)
By: Associated Press | Kabul | Posted: November 10, 2014 1:39 am
Afghan authorities are investigating how a man wearing an explosives-packed vest was able to infiltrate the heavily guarded police headquarters in central Kabul on Sunday and attempt to assassinate the city’s chief of police.
The suicide bomber’s ability to pass through heavy security and make his way to within meters of General Mohammad Zahir Zahir’s office has revived concerns that insurgents have penetrated Afghanistan’s security and intelligence forces.
The incident was a serious breach of security in the fortified center of the capital and has highlighted the vulnerability of Kabul to a determined and still-virulent Taliban insurgency as a dwindling number of US and NATO troops shift from a combat role to training and support by the end of this year.
Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said the incident had raised questions about someone “wearing a suicide vest who had breached security’’.
“The man was wearing a civilian suit and had a file in his hand and the suicide vest under his clothes,’’ said Sediqqi.
“He was asking police directions to the chief of police’s office, saying he had papers to deliver to him. This is the procedure for anyone who wants to meet with the chief of police, so the police sent him in the right direction.’’
Earlier, Zahir said that the man was wearing a military uniform. Sediqqi said that footage from closed-circuit television clearly showed the attacker’s route through the compound.
Zahir was not in his office on the third floor of the building at the time of the attack, around 9 am, Sediqqi said, “but he was definitely the target’’.
Zahir’s chief of staff, Col Mohammad Yasin was killed in the attack. At least seven others were wounded.
The compound is in one of the most heavily guarded areas of Kabul and also houses the office of the Kabul provincial governor, the Appeals Court and police detention centers for men and women. It is surrounded by high concrete blast walls, with turrets manned by paramilitary police armed with Russian-made PK heavy machine guns. Visitors must past through a number of checkpoints, including body searches and x-rays.

Aggressive reforms in the offing: Jaitley pledges rational tax policyArun Jaitley pledges ‘rational’ tax policy, changes in labour laws, fuel price deregulation and natural resources auctions

(“Aggressive reforms…)
NEW DELHI: India will pursue an aggressive reforms agenda over the next few months to help get the country back to a high-growth trajectory and on the radar of investors, finance minister Arun Jaitley said, promising a reasonable and rational tax policy that will not be "ultra-aggressive" to help further improve sentiment.
"Government has its plate full with respect to reforms for the next few months," Jaitley said in Delhi on Sunday. "Aggressive reforms will help India to grow faster... Hope India will get back on the investors' radar."
The government is looking to alter the land acquisition law as part of reform efforts and is in the last stages of discussions with states on changes to the constitutional amendment bill required for the long-awaited goods and services tax to become a reality.
The government has already embarked on changes in labour policy, fuel price deregulation and natural resources auctions among others.
Jaitley exuded optimism that the insurance bill, seeking to raise the foreign direct investment cap, will be passed in the upcoming session of Parliament.
Speaking at the India Global Forum organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the minister said the Indian economy faces challenges but expects growth to improve next year.
"Economy was and is in a challenging situation and one of the principal challenges before us is to restore the confidence in the Indian economy, to expand economic activity and move towards increasing the growth rate," he said, adding that growth next year will be a "little better". If the trend continues, India could well be restored to a high-growth path.
Streamlining the tax regime and ending uncertainty is a critical part of making India more attractive to investors."We have seen the challenges before the economy. A reasonable and rational tax policy (is needed), it can't be ultra aggressive with tax payers," the minister said. The tax department now follows the principle that those who have to pay tax should do so and those who don't have to should not be harassed for non-payment, he said. He also spoke of the rationale behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make In India manufacturing initiative.
"We have realised that one of the greatest challenges we have is the manufacturing sector. The economy had touched a new low and therefore the manufacturing sector is itself is delicately poised in India. We have to eventually try and make India a hub of low-cost manufacturing," he added.
He also said the government will amend the tough land acquisition law as it looks to restore confidence in the economy. "Some changes may be necessary. We will first try to reach a consensus and if that is not possible we will go ahead and take the decision." The Land Acquisition Bill has been widely criticised by industry as also state governments and central departments for stalling project development. Jaitley said that "obstacles" to land laws would have to be first removed in order to implement the concept of smart cities in India. Alluding to recent reform measures including the coal ordinance, he said the government is giving finishing touches to a reworked mining law.
He said there is a need to follow the e-auction route for the allocation of natural resources to make the process transparent and eliminate corruption.
Allaying skepticism about disinvestment remaining on track, the finance minister said the programme will "unfold" in the next few days. He added that the government aims to lower its equity in public sector banks to 52%.

Prabhu  the political misfit in Cabinet | Parrikar  man with impeccable integrityBal Thackeray
(Modi wanted the 61-year-old…)
MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Humble, soft spoken, man of integrity, these are attributes seldom associated with politicians but fits Suresh Prabhu . Once rated one of the three future leaders of India by Asiaweek, Prabhu was largely ignored by Shiv Sena since 2004. Ten years later, Prabhu returned to be sworn in as Cabinet minister , as a BJP member. Modi wanted the 61-year-old banker-politician in his government despite an overwhelming opinion that he's a 'misfit' in politics.
"He isn't a politician. He is a misfit because he doesn't subscribe to party culture, nor is he a yes-man. He is a fantastic administrator, but doesn't project himself as one. He is very well read and aware of what's going around him, but would be unaware of what's happening in his party," said a Sena leader who knows Prabhu. "And if anyone deserves to be a minister, it's Prabhu," he concluded.
He had brought a rare spark as power minister in Vajpayee's government. Veteran Journalist Pratap Thorat spoke of how Bal Thackeray discovered Prabhu: "Thackeray wanted some experts to interact with Uddhav to broaden his horizons. Shantaram Gotoskar, a journalist with a language daily entrusted the task to Prabhu, who was managing Saraswat Bank. His interactions impressed the Sena chief and he decided Prabhu would be the party's Lok Sabha candidate from Rajapur in 1996," reminisces Thorat.
Thackeray next chose him as a minister, ignoring the claims of seasoned Sena leaders. "I still remember senior leaders sitting at Matoshree to lobby for the post. Prabhu wasn't there, but Thackeray said Prabhu would be the party's choice," said Thorat. Prabhu was to impress his new boss Vajpayee soon. "Vajpayee had a special liking for him... Prabhu as power minister tried hard to initiate reforms in the sector. He campaigns hard for the issues he believes in and is a strong implementor," said ex-BJP member Sudheendra Kulkarni.
But this irked the Thackerays, and Sena forced Prabhu to resign. He, however, took this in his stride. "In all these years, he never spoke against the Thackerays, nor was he demoralised. He quietly went back to his consultancy work," said Thorat.
Prabhu has the ability to take risks and stand by his actions. "We used to tell him that we have plans for the bank but were afraid to implement them. He would always tell us not to bother about the consequences since he would take responsibility," said DR Shirodkar, CEO of New India Cooperative Bank, who worked with Prabhu for 12 years.
His main drawback is that he is not a people's leader. "When he was with the Sena, he stayed aloof from the cadres, and ignored his constituency as an MP. He couldn't connect with the people... he couldn't draw crowds with a speech. Since he is not a political operator, he can only work under a good boss," said Thorat. One will have to see whether he's found the right boss.

New faces of Modi s Cabinet | Parrikar new Defence Minister  Prabhu gets RailwaysChoudhary Birender Singh
(Modi’s election promise…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi carried out the first expansion of his council of ministers on Sunday inducting former Goa CM Manohar Parrikar and former NDA minister Suresh Prabhu , both known for their administrative acumen, as well as BJP general secretary Jagat Prakash Nadda and former UPA minister Choudhary Birender Singh in the cabinet.
The portfolios for the new ministers were announced late on Sunday night. Parrikar was given the defence portfolio, Prabhu railways, Nadda health ministry and Singh rural development. Jayant Sinha was named the new minister of state in the finance ministry while Olympian Rajyavardhan Rathore was made minister of state for information & broadcasting (I&B). Sadananda Gowda was moved from railways to the law ministry. He takes over from Ravi Shankar Prasad , who retains telecom.
Jaitley was given the additional charge of I&B ministry.
Former Army chief VK Singh was moved from northeast development to statistics and programme implemention.
Almost all the names reported by ET in its edition dated November 7 found a place in the expanded list of ministers.
Apart from the four cabinet ministers, former NDA civil aviation minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy , former NDA junior minister for urban development Bandaru Dattatreya and Noida MP Mahesh Sharma were sworn in as ministers of state with independent charge. In all, 21 ministers were inducted into the council of ministers.
Prabhu, who was a Sena nominee in the Vajpayee government, joined BJP on Sunday and now is a BJP minister in the Modi government.
While Parrikar has flown to Lucknow to file papers to contest Rajya Sabha polls, Prabhu will have to get elected to one of the houses of Parliament within six months.
BJP spokesperson and the party's Muslim face, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, former Lalu Prasad aide and BJP's Patliputra MP Ram Kripal Yadav, and the sole Bhumihar representative from Bihar Giriraj Singh, among the 14 ministers of state, sort of balanced the caste, communal and regional equations.
Three out of the four new cabinet ministers are from the Brahmin community. The presence of Fatehpur MP and a Sangh Parivar religious teacher, Sadhvi Niranjan, the only woman, among the 21 inductees as well as that of Singh, the MP from Bihar who had earned notoriety for threatening to pack off opponents of Modi to Pakistan, underscored the fact that the party's more hardline wing had been represented in the exercise. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were conspicuously absent at the swearing-in, possibly indicating a deepening of political polarization, where most other Opposition parties were not spotted.

Infosys stock outperformed NSE IT index since Vishal Sikka joined company as CEO
Varun Sood, ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 07.03AM IST

first non-founder chief executive
(It is the world’s most…)
BENGALURU: Last week, Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, along with the company's senior managers, interacted with about 100 analysts at a five-star hotel over a three-day event in Orlando, making Ray Wang of Constellation Research remark that the newly-appointed boss was "inviting, not defensive", "forward thinking", "not retrospective" and "authentic not forced." His colleague Alan Lepofsky observed that this meeting had "more suits and ties" than any other conference he had been to this year.
Lepofsky is right, for an event by Infosys does manage to have the largest confluence of analysts. It is the world's most scrutinised company, with more than 57 analysts worldwide tracking a company that posted revenue of more than $8.2 billion last fiscal.
So what exactly has Sikka been up to in the 100 days since taking over as the first non-founder chief executive at the company?
To start with, he's attempting to bring about a cultural shift in mindset. "If we do the work of a drone, expect to be replaced," Sikka told the gathering. This cultural shift is largely being pushed by bringing in Design Thinking, a user-centric, problem-solving approach to help engineers make simple, wellwritten code. Already, the company has trained 5,238 employees and aims to have more than 30,000 engineers undergo the process at its Mysore facility.
The company has started placing a team of specialists across service lines who can solve what it believes are some of the challenging business problems enterprises face. The team of Value Ninjas is intended to help the company get more business from existing clients. Sikka's new team of seven former SAP executives, including five senior vice-presidents, will help drive this initiative, which requires a "product centric" background, said a senior company executive.
"Data analytics is the key for this will help customers as they seek faster innovation," according to the executive. This is validated by the company's decision to beef up hiring in its data analytics team, with 300 of the 2,100 professionals the company will hire in the US in the coming 12 months to join this group.
"The new Infosys is here," said Holger Mueller, principal analyst and vice-president at Constellation Research. "Infosys has been focused on product IP before, but there can be no doubt that the product focus has been renewed and reenforced with his appointment."
But are any of the 912 customers buying into Infosys's transformational exercise? Most importantly, has Infosys managed to win new accounts since Sikka's arrival? To be sure, the company posted better-than-expected second quarter results as revenue grew 3.2% over the April-June period to $2,201 million.
The event was attended by eight of Infosys' large clients, including Sean McCormack, chief technology officer at Harley Davidson, the US-based motorcycle maker. On the company's recently spunoff products, platforms and solutions business, which accounts for less than 5% of total revenues, Infosys management shared some early insights.
  Sanjay Purohit, boss of Edge-Verve, outlined six focus areas to scale up the division. The six scope areas are digital marketing, commerce, customer service, distribution (with TradeEdge), ecosystem management and procurement. "Purohit was pretty clear this is a real product offering, with the source code only available to his team," one of the analysts told ET.
Sikka is also focusing on a partnership model, with Infosys forging alliances with companies and universities. Internally too, the change of leadership at the top has brought in a renewed confidence and buzz among the employees. "In my sense, it (attrition) should come down to 13-15% in the next two to three quarters," UB Pravin Rao, chief operating officer, told ET in an interview last month. The 1,65,000-strong Infosys reported an attrition rate of 20.1% for the second quarter ended September.
Investors have been buoyant:
Since Sikka took over as chief executive on August 1, the stock has outperformed the broader National Stock Exchange IT index, up 24.3% versus 12.2%.

Several small caps trading at eye-popping valuationsArun Kejriwal
(The inclusion of Tilak Finance…)
MUMBAI: Late last week, when little-known Tilak Finance made it to the MSCI Small Cap index, it stunned many on Dalal Street. The company's turnover for the year ended March 31, 2014 was Rs 6.42 crore, while its market capitalisation — value of outstanding shares — was Rs 3,861 crore on Friday. The company's only asset is the 19.2 lakh shares, worth Rs 86 lakh, it owns in Esaar India (not Essar Group ).
The inclusion of Tilak Finance along with a couple of others into the MSCI index has put the spotlight on small-cap stocks — many of which are trading at eye-popping valuations. Market watchers said the abnormal values of these stocks suggest operators are active in many of them.
According to an ET study, the market capitalisation-to-sales ratio of nearly 250 actively-traded small-cap stocks is between 50 and 500 times. M-cap-to-sales ratio — one of the several popular valuation matrices — evaluates a stock's performance vis-a-vis the company's actual performance. Broadly, a stock with a marketcap-to-sales ratio of less than one can be considered undervalued. But this ratio varies from sector to sector. For instance, the market cap-to-sales of the IT index is 4.2 times; 5 times for fast-moving consumer goods, 1.6 times for capital goods and 0.6 times for oil and gas.
"Almost in all these stocks promoter holding is minimal, which makes it easy for the operators to manipulate their stock prices," said Arun Kejriwal , founder and CEO of KRIS Research .
After a long hiatus, activity in mid- and small-cap stocks revived in February, sparked by the election euphoria. The heightened activity in this category of shares in the last few months is the lengthiest since 2007. For instance, MC Fincorp (formerly Priti Mercantile) has surged over 331% since January 1. The company with a turnover of Rs 10 crore and net profit of Rs 1.28 crore as on March 31, 2014 is currently valued about Rs 5,000 crore in market cap, which is more than the value of more established companies such as Pfizer , IL&FS Transport, JK Lakshmi Cement or Sobha Developers. CCL International, with a net profit of just Rs 99 lakh, is trading at a market cap of Rs 4,906 crore. The stock found place in the recent revamp of MSCI Smallcap Index.
Several companies like Goldline International, Sulabh Engineers & Services, Pine Animation, Surabhi Chemicals & Investments and Mangalam Industrial Finance, among others, with a sales of few crores and profits of a few lakhs traded with a market cap of over Rs 2,000 crore. Officials at larger brokerages said operators are luring retail investors to buy these stocks by sending text message alerts, Whatsapp messages and emails though it is not as rampant as it was in 2006 and 2007.
While capital market regulator Sebi has strengthened its surveillance in recent years, market watchers believe more could be done in the small-cap space. "The stocks that are trading at unreasonable valuations without any reason warrant an investigation for the price manipulations," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD, InGovern Research Services.

What Narendra Modi s new recruits Manohar Parrikar  others bring to the tableNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Prime Minister Narendra Modi undertook an expansion of his council of ministers and reshuffled portfolios while bringing in 21 new faces. Among them, Manohar Parrikar got Defence Ministry, Suresh Prabhu will head the Railway Ministry, J P Nadda has been given Health and Rajiv Pratap Rudy has been made MoS (Independent charge) for Skill development.
Here is what these new recruits bring to the table:
Manohar Parrikar
From being the first IITian to become a CM, technocrat-turned-politician Manohar Gopalkrishna Parrikar has come a long way. The 59-year-old RSS pracharak, set to get the defence portfolio, will preside over the Modi government’s policy of indigensing defence production, a key component of the Make in India campaign.
As three-time Goa CM, Parrikar has earned the reputation of being a corruption-free administrator and a hard taskmaster. He had led a campaign against the Congress-led government on illegal mining in the state. His decision to reduce petrol prices by around R11 per litre and social schemes like ‘Ladli Lakshmi’ and ‘Grih Adhar’ made him hugely popular in the state. Parrikar has Modi’s trust as he had publicly backed the PM in the 2014 polls, but he is also known for his blunt talk — he once said the post-Godhra riots were a blot on Modi’s career even though he was not a part of it.
Suresh Prabhu
The Shiv Sena high command is certainly not pleased as Prabhu had long fallen out of favour with it. Notably, Sena MP Anil Desai failed to take oath amid talk that Uddhav Thackeray will pull out of the government in New Delhi and play Opposition in Maharashtra.
During Vajpayee’s reign, Prabhu held portfolios such as industry, environment and forests, fertilizers & chemicals, power, heavy industry and public enterprises. He was also chairman of Task Force for Interlinking of Rivers. As power minister, he took steps towards affordable power and introduced transparency in project bidding, among other things. He also spearheaded a project on improving efficiency of old power stations and lowering transmission losses. A qualified CA and banker-politician, Prabhu, 61, is in the good books of Modi. Despite the problems between BJP and the Sena, he was appointed as Modi’s ‘sherpa’ for the forthcoming G20 summit.
JP Nadda
One of the three prominent figures involved in BJP’s decision-making , Nadda enjoys the confidence of both Modi and party president Amit Shah. Born in Bihar, the 53-year-old Nadda has emerged as a strong figure from Himachal Pradesh, where he was member of the legislative assembly before entering the Rajya Sabha. An efficient lieutenant to Modi, Nanda is likely to be a bridge between the party and the government.
Nadda joined student politics inspired by the JP Movement. He was an active member of BJP’s student wing, the ABVP, where he won polls to become the Patna University secretary in 1977. Nadda served ABVP for nearly 13 years, holsing many key positions.
Though mild-mannered, Nanda is known as a hard taskmaster. He was a strong contender for the post of BJP president, but he extended full support to Shah after losing the race earlier this year.
Nadda has also served as health minister in Himachal Pradesh government.
Rajiv Pratap Rudy
A post-graduate in economics and a commercial pilot, Rudy worked his way up in politics with a decade of field work in rural Bihar to become the youngest member of the legislative assembly in 1990.
A member of the previous NDA government, he initially held the commerce and industry portfolio as a minister of state and, then, the civil aviation portfolio as a minister of state with independent charge. The 52-year-old tech-savvy politician also worked as an economics lecturer in Bihar.
In the early part of his political career, Rudy was president of the Chandigarh government college students union. During his work in Bihar, he was closely associated with the BJP’s youth wing as national vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.
Rudy has served in various political and Parliamentary panels, including the Committee on Patents (Second Amendment) Bill in 1999. During leisure, he engages in adventure sport and travel.

Gujarat Guv gives nod to mandatory voting BillO P Kohli
By: Express News Service | Gandhinagar | Posted: November 9, 2014 7:07 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 12:33 pm
Gujarat Governor O P Kohli recently signed the controversial Gujarat Local Authorities Laws Bill, 2009, which has the provisions of compulsory voting and 50 per cent reservation for women in the institutions of local self-governance. Once the Act comes into effect, Gujarat will be the first state to have the provision of compulsory voting.
Secretary of Gujarat Assembly D M Patel said the Governor signed the Bill a few days back and it has been sent to the Legislation Department of the government.
Meanwhile, sources in the Legislation Department said the Bill had the provision that the government would issue notification as and when it felt fit to come out with various additional provisions to implement the law, like the punishment for the voter who does not go for voting.
“These notifications will be issued by the government now in due course,” the sources said.
The Bill encompasses municipal corporations, municipalities and the district, taluka and village panchayats of Gujarat. Elections to six municipal corporations, 31 district panchayats, 231 taluka panchayats and 53 nagarpalikas in Gujarat are due in October next year.
The Bill, which was passed twice by the Gujarat government led by the then chief minister Narendra Modi, had faced stiff resistance from former governor Kamla Beniwal on the ground that forcing voters to compulsorily vote violates Article 21 of the Constitution.
The Bill provides that a person, who does not vote in the local body polls, will be liable for penal action and punishment. The Bill was first introduced in the Assembly in December 2009 and passed by a majority vote.
It was, however, returned by Beniwal in April 2010 with remarks that “forcing voter to vote is against the principles of individual liberty”. Beniwal had returned the Bill to the government for reconsideration with her comments.
Beniwal had also asked the government to separate issue of women’s reservation in local body polls from the compulsory voting one.
However, ignoring Beniwal’s suggestions, the then Modi government had once again passed the Bill on December 28, 2011 by a majority vote in the Assembly and sent it to Beniwal. The Bill was also made a part of the poll agenda by the BJP during the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls.

Web & mobile-driven sales at McDonald’s, KFC on the rise, helping them cut costs by half
Ratna Bhushan, ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 06.52AM IST
(The restaurant chains add…)
NEW DELHI: Hungry? If you have a smartphone, you can order a burger online and be rest assured McDonald's is lovin' it. But that's not the only chain that likes online orders. Domino's, KFC, restaurants like Mainland China and Punjab Grill and even local outfits such as Biryani Zone are pushing this route aggressively in an environment that continues to see sales and profits under pressure.
Why? Online orders slash the cost of restaurant chains by half because they reduce the dependence on call centres as these are routed directly from the website to the relevant outlet. They are also more convenient as they allow customers to order from anywhere — on the move or unable to make a phone call. The restaurant chains add that orders through apps help them inform customers about offers, promotions and new menu items, not always possible when an order is placed by phone and is dependent on how effectively the call centre operator can communicate.
"Sheer convenience is driving online ordering numbers," said Harneet Singh Rajpal, senior VP, marketing, at Jubilant FoodWorks. The company said its mobile ordering app has crossed 2 million downloads across smartphones, with the online contribution to delivery sales in the July-September quarter touching 27%, compared with 18% in the year earlier.
"People downloading apps on their mobiles or through their iPads or computer screens is not only a personalised way to order, it also saves us time and costs since the orders are flashed directly on kitchen screens of the concerned restaurants," Rajpal added. Jubilant reported a 5.3% decline in same-store sales compared with 6.6% in the year-ago quarter and a 12.7% decline in standalone net profit to .`29 crore in the July-September quarter.
In global markets such as the US, web and mobile ordering contributes more than 50-60% to sales of restaurants. In India, the trend is gaining ground very rapidly, said experts. Harminder Sahni, founder of consulting firm Wazir Advisors, said: "Online ordering can bring down cost by up to 40-50%... There is a direct correlation as the firms save on maintenance of call centre costs which reduces pressure on profitability."
McDonald's west and south region operator Hardcastle Restaurants revamped its online delivery business this January in recognition of the trend. "Ever since, contribution of our online delivery business has gone up from 5% to about 30% now," said Amit Jatia, vice-chairman of Hardcastle, which runs 192 restaurants across the region. "With web and mobile ordering, it is very rewarding to report positive results in an intensely competitive market, even though we expect economic challenges to persist in the near term," Jatia added.
Harcastle reported a 7.9% decline in same store sales in the July-September compared with 5.5% in corresponding year-ago quarter. For KFC, Yum Restaurants' fastest-growing restaurant chain in India, online orders are almost a fourth of its delivery sales, a spokesperson said. Yum's India division system sales for the July-September quarter were down 4%.
Online food ordering platform foodpanda. in, which connects 4,000 restaurants in 100 cities and operates in 40-plus countries, said its mobile app has now crossed 5 million downloads. Foodpanda.in co-founder Rohit Chadda said even fine-dining restaurants such as Mainland China and Punjab Grill are getting traction on online orders. "While a combination of orders placed through computers and mobile apps is driving sales, there is a clear emerging preference towards using mobile apps for online ordering, ahead of computers or tablets." Chadda said.

Nikkei hits 1-week low as US jobs data lifts yenNikkei hits 1-week low as US jobs data lifts yen
Reuters

Tokyo, Nov 10:  
Japanese stocks retreated to a one-week low on Monday morning as the yen rebounded against the dollar after US jobs data fell short of expectations, while Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp sold off heavily on a profit warning.
The benchmark Nikkei share average dropped 0.8 per cent to 14,752.04 after falling to as low as 16,713.37, the weakest level since October 31.
NTT tumbles on profit warning
NTT tumbled 6.4 per cent to a two-week low after the telecommunication company cut its full-year operating profit outlook to ¥1.095 trillion from ¥1.215 trillion, hit by its weak mobile phone business. It was the fourth-most traded stock by turnover.
Traders said that the Nikkei is likely pull back further this week given the sharp rally since October 31, thanks to the Bank of Japan’s surprise move to ease policy further and a decision by the Government Pension Investment Fund to increase its allocation of funds to domestic stocks.
Foreigners, who were net sellers in Japanese futures for the past five weeks, bought ¥831.7 billion ($7.21 billion) worth of Japanese futures during October 27-31, according to data provided by the Osaka Exchange. It was the biggest purchase on record, Nomura Securities said.
“Given the extremely aggressive buying recently, the market is prone to profit-taking,’’ said Hiroyuki Nakai, senior executive director at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
“Investors seem to be satisfied after the Nikkei traded above the 17,000-mark and the dollar rose above 115 yen.’’
Exporters languished after the dollar slid to 114.45 yen from a seven-year high of 115.60 after US jobs data missed forecasts. Toyota Motor Corp dropped 1.2 per cent, Honda Motor Co shed 0.6 per cent and Advantest Corp fell 0.5 per cent.
Sneaker manufacturer Asics Corp rose as much as 7.1 per cent after it hiked its net profit outlook for the year ending December to ¥20 billion from the previously forecast ¥17.5 billion.
The broader Topix shed 0.3 per cent to 1,359.87, and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 declined 0.3 per cent to 12,405.95.

Gold dips after rallying on US jobs dataGold dips after rallying on US jobs data
Reuters
Tweet
Singapore, Nov 10:  
Gold slipped nearly 1 per cent early on Monday after a short-covering rally in the previous session, fuelled by a softer-than-expected US jobs report, showing that the metal was still not out of the woods.
Despite a 3 per cent jump on Friday, gold remained below a key $1,180-an-ounce level that could pressure the metal back to 4-1/2-year lows reached last week on a strong dollar and fears regarding an upcoming rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.
Spot gold
Spot gold fell as much as 0.9 per cent to $1,168.10 before recovering slightly to trade down about $8 at $1,170.67 by 0045 GMT.
On Friday, gold fell to $1,131.85 — its lowest since April 2010 — before recovering to post its biggest one-day gain in five months.
US non-farm payrolls data
Gold got a boost after US non-farm payrolls increased 214,000 in October versus a projected 231,000, hurting the dollar and boosting the metal’s appeal as a hedge.
But details of the report were solid with the unemployment rate dipping to a fresh six-year low of 5.8 per cent even as more people entered the work force. The jump also followed earlier sharp losses in the week as speculators covered their short positions.
However, investor positions show that the sentiment towards bullion remains bearish and the metal could plumb new lows before the end of the year.
Holding in SPDR Gold Trust
Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.78 per cent to 727.15 tonnes on Friday — its lowest in six years.
Hedge funds and money managers slashed their bullish bets in gold futures and options to their lowest in four weeks, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had said on Friday.
Gold’s rout may be far from over, with many analysts and traders surveyed by Reuters predicting prices could fall to $1,000 per ounce by the end of the year for the first time since 2009.
In other market news, the curtain came down on nearly a century of tradition for bullion markets on Friday when US bourse Intercontinental Exchange was named as provider of an electronic benchmark gold price to replace the twice daily “fix’’.
Calling time on London’s century-old gold fix could mark the beginning of an even wider industry overhaul that may ultimately dilute the dominance of the highly profitable bilateral over-the-counter trading.

Asian shares firm on US jobs  Chinas export growth dataAsian shares firm on US jobs, China’s export growth data
Reuters
Tweet
Tokyo, Nov 10:  
Asian shares held firm in early Monday trade after US jobs data pointed to solid economic growth, while China’s export performance showed more resilience than some had expected.
US employers added 214,000 jobs in October, slightly below economists’ median forecast of 231,000, but logging the ninth consecutive month of gains of more than 200,000, the longest stretch since 1994.
Unemployment fell to a six-year low of 5.8 per cent, but that did not improve wage growth, with average hourly earnings rising a slim 0.1 per cent, falling short of a projected 0.2 per cent gain.
“It was a familiar combination. Rising payrolls, a falling jobless rate and stagnant wages. All this means is that the US economy is moderately recovering, and no major shift in the Fed’s policy outlook, which should reduces market volatility,’’ Tohru Yamamoto, chief fixed income strategist at Daiwa Securities, said in a report.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei, however, slipped as the yen rebounded on profit-taking in the dollar following the US payroll data.
US share prices ended flat on Friday following the payrolls data as some investors took some money off the table after the market’s rally to record highs.
Dollar vs other currencies
The US dollar also stepped back from a four-year peak against a basket of currencies. The dollar index stood at 87.539, following a 0.4 per cent fall on Friday as it retreated from 88.190 — a high not seen since June 2010.
As the dollar slipped, the euro fetched $1.2460, off a two-year low of $1.2358 hit on Friday.
The yen traded at 114.54 to the dollar, about one percentage point above seven-year low of 115.60 per dollar hit on Friday.
The dollar’s fall lifted the battered gold price from 4 1/2-year lows. Gold traded at $1,170.15 per ounce, above Friday’s low of $1,131.85.
Commodity currencies also won something of a reprieve, with the Australian dollar popping back above 86 US cents from a four-year low of $0.8540.
China’s export growth
Also helping underpin commodity currencies, data out of China on Saturday showed export growth did not slow as much as feared.
“Overall, the data painted a similar macro picture as in previous months: Robust export growth led by the US and ASEAN demand, and depressed imports driven by falling commodity prices and soft domestic demand,’’ said Jian Chang, an analyst at Barclays.
Exports grew 11.6 per cent in October, slowing from a 15.3 per cent jump in September but beating expectations of a 10.6 per cent rise. Imports were weaker than expected.
But the official Shanghai Securities News said on Monday that the above-forecast export growth and heavy trade surplus in October showed signs of manipulation as well as inflows of speculative hot money, quoting economists.
Inflation data
The next focus is China inflation data due later in the day. China’s annual inflation is seen at 1.6 per cent in October, steady from the previous month, but way below the official target of 3.5 per cent.

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty hit fresh lifetime highs on capitalinflowsPrint
BSE Sensex hit new record-high of 28,027.96 and the NSE Nifty touched another peak of 8,383.05, respectively in opening trade today. (Reuters)
By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 10, 2014 10:21 am | Updated: November 10, 2014 5:06 pm
After hitting a new record high of 28,027.96 points in early trade as investors cheered Cabinet expansion, the benchmark Sensex today ended just 6 points higher compared to the previous close as investors booked profit across counters.
After opening on a strong footing, the 30-share Sensex surged to hit new lifetime high of 28,027.96, breaching its previous high of 28,010.39 recorded on November 5.
The index soon started losing momentum quickly and briefly slipped into the negative territory in volatile trade to touch a low of 27,764.75. It finally ended 6.10 points higher at 27,874.73.
ITC Ltd, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s, Hind Unilever, Coal India, Bajaj Auto, BHEL, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Wipro led the 15 Sensex gainers, while Tata Motors, Tata Steel, TCS, SBI, Sesa Sterlite, RIL, M&M, L&T, ICICI Bank and ONGC were among the 15 losers.
The 50-share NSE Nifty after hitting a new peak of 8,383.05 in early trade, also succumbed to profit-booking. It gave up most of initial gains to touch a low of 8,304.45 before ending at 8,344.25, showing a moderate rise of 7.25 points. The gauge had previous intra-day record high of 8,365.55, touched on November 5.
Market players said sentiment was upbeat on hopes that the government will accelerate economic reforms process after expansion of the Union Cabinet, lifting the Sensex and Nifty to new highs.
Some investors sitting on gains, however, became cautious and booked profits in recent outperformers, dragging down the key indices from record highs, they added.
Sectorally, the BSE FMCG index gained the most by rising 2.81 per cent, followed by consumer durables index 1.00 per cent, power index 0.84 per cent and healthcare index 0.47 per cent.
However, oil & gas index ended in the negative zone with a fall of 1.29 per cent, capital goods index (down 1.01 per cent), banking index (down 0.53 per cent), PSU index (down 0.48 per cent) and auto index (down 0.34 per cent).
A mixed closing at the other Asian markets and a slightly higher opening on the European markets influenced the sentiment, market players said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 2,537.13 crore on Friday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.

Theatre is likecookingSanchayita Bhattacharjee as a desperate housewife in A Woman Alone.
Written by Dipanita Nath | Posted: November 10, 2014 10:28 am | Updated: November 10, 2014 12:04 pm
A voice like a hammer answers the phone. It hits you that Sanchayita Bhattacharjee may not be too distant from the formidable protagonist of her latest solo A Woman Alone who suffers fools only until she can shoot them down. The actor, however, insists that she is “very malleable in real life”. Is this because Bhattacharjee is also a chef — specialising in French cuisine — since theatre has offered her only strong, even headstrong, women characters?
She has always been passionate about theatre, says Bhattacharjee, but when the chance came to choose between the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) and Le Cordon Bleu — two prime schools for theatre and hospitality education respectively — the actor opted for the kitchen. At the Le Cordon Bleu in London, Israeli celebrity chef Michael Katz gave her the moniker Chef Sunshine, which sticks to this day. Chef Sunshine now has a restaurant in Kolkata called The Restaurant on the First Floor as well as 25 theatre roles to her credit. She is a part of Kolkata-based arts organisation Padatik and performed in the Capital for the Delhi International Arts Festival. Excerpts from an interview:
She has played a man: It was in a play called Mr Hardheart when I was studying at St Thomas in Delhi. Our principal Mrs Joy Michael, a well-known theatre person who started the Yatrik group, ensured that we learned theatre craft, which included sets, lighting and backstage work. Mr Hardheart was a comic role of a stingy man who has a change of heart after meeting Father Christmas. When I went to Jadavpur University in Kolkata, I did lights and was the first girl to do so in the city.
Theatre is like cooking: It helps me reach out creatively. Unlike film and television, theatre is for the moment and you are only as good as your last character. Every performance is like a new dish; the freshness of every audience and the excitement of playing a role anew keep me going.
The housewife in A Woman Alone is like a curry: It is a fiery curry that starts slow, melts in your mouth and then hits you in the back of your head. She  talks to a new neighbour about her husband who has given her all luxuries and locked her up in her own home. She looks after her brother-in-law who has roving hands, she deals with dirty phone calls, she deals with a psychotic ex-boyfriend, she deals with a pervert who stares at her, she deals with a crying baby — and she makes all of this sound ridiculous.
WOman on the edge can be tough: A Woman Alone is not a laugh riot, it is more a giggly kind of black comedy. Franca Rame, an Italian theatre actor and political activist, said that we women have been continued…

How young working couples can build wealth without compromising on lifestyles
ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 08.00AM IST

( If your investment horizon…)
By Bindisha Sarang
Life can be carefree for young working couples. They have more money and not too many financial responsibilities. But they also have more ways to spend the money. Meet Visakhapatnam-based architect Ananth Domatoti, 31, and his wife Anita Patnaik, 30. They have a combined annual income of almost Rs 22 lakh, but are not able to save even 5% of that. "I struggle to keep my expenses under control," admits Ananth.
In Mumbai, Vishal Nalawade, 30, and his wife Shraddha, 29, are facing a different problem. They have good jobs, spend carefully and save 60% of their net income every month. Yet, their finances are not really going places. In fact, their entire savings of Rs 5 lakh is idling in a bank account, earning a piffling 4% even as inflation eats into its purchasing power. Financial planners would baulk at this. "It's not very smart to keep so much money in a savings bank account. A balance of Rs 1 lakh for emergencies is more than enough," says Mumbai-based financial planner Suresh Sadagopan.
Young working couples such as the Domatotis and the Nalawades are frittering away a terrific opportunity. If they are careful in the way they save, invest and spend their money, they can transform their financial future. Apart from high incomes and few financial responsibilities, these double-income couples have time on their side. With almost 25-30 years of working life ahead of them, they can amass a huge amount using the power of compounding.
This week's cover story looks at how young couples can capitalise on the advantages to build substantial wealth without compromising too much on their lifestyles. We look at the most common mistakes that young couples are likely to make and also list out the essential steps they must take in these formative years.
When you are young and earning well, savings and investing often take a back seat. The double-income comfort tricks many couples into thinking that their saving plans can be postponed by a few years. delaying investments can be a costly mistake because the investor loses out on the power of compounding. We all know that compounding can work wonders but here's an eye opener: If one starts saving Rs 5,000 a month at the age of 30 and earns 10% compounded returns, he would have Rs 1.13 crore at the age of 60. If he delays the investment by 10 years and starts at 40, he will manage to save only Rs 38 lakh. "The sooner you begin, the bigger is the corpus. Young couples should start putting away in the initial years itself," advises Pankaj Mathpal, a Mumbai-based financial planner.
Don't save, invest
Saving alone is not enough. The Nalawades have been saving for more than one year, but instead of growing, their money has shrunk in value in real terms. Wholesale inflation may be down but consumer inflation is still raging at around 7%. If you assume an inflation rate of 7%, the 4% return on their savings idling in the bank account actually means a loss of 3%.
"I am not very clued in to financial matters so could not decide where to invest," explains Vishal, almost embarrassed about the loss in purchasing power. For young investors like him, equity mutual funds should be the instrument of choice. Identifying a good fund is not rocket science. The couple should start investing a small amount in any five-star diversified equity fund.
If the Nalawades have not deployed their money because they lack knowledge, Bengaluru-based IT professionals Aditya Vajha and his wife Sonia Kakodkar have stayed away from equities because of their past experience with the asset class. They are not even 30 but have the risk profile that even a retiree would find too conservative.
  Understanding your risk profile is very important. Young people often make the mistake of taking too little risk even though they can withstand some volatility. If your investment horizon is more than 5-6 years, there is no reason why you should be investing in debt instruments that offer very low yields. The Domatotis are putting away their entire investible surplus in recurring deposits. They should consider equity funds which can give them better returns. Of course, they should do this in a graded manner.
This approach will especially be suitable for Vajha and Kakodkar, who have vowed to stay away from equities due to past losses. Instead of investing and saving for their other goals, they are aggressively paying down their home loan. Apart from the EMI of Rs 37,000, they put their entire monthly surplus of Rs 50,000 in a home saver account to prepay the home loan. "It's good to be debt free but in their bid to prepay their home loan they may be compromising their future," says Parag Paranjpe, a financial planner. At least Rs 10,000 should be diverted to an SIP in a good diversified equity fund. If they are still fearful, they could consider a balanced fund.
Separate wants from needs

China October inflation hovers near 5-year lowBeijing
(The producer price index…)
BEIJING: China's annual consumer inflation remained near a five-year low in October at 1.6 per cent, further evidence that the world's second-largest economy is cooling and reinforcing expectations that authorities will roll out more measures to support growth.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected annual consumer inflation to be 1.6 per cent in October, the same as September, which was the weakest reading since January 2010.
On a monthly basis, consumer inflation was flat in October, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. That compared with 0.1 per cent expected by economists.
"The risk of deflation has risen as the economy is expected to slow further in the next few quarters," ANZ economists said in a research note.
"This is a significant risk ... which requires China's policymakers to monitor the situation closely and take action swiftly," ANZ said, suggesting the central bank could inject money into the system more frequently to keep the financial system working smoothly.
Facing mounting risks to growth and rising risks of deflation, Beijing is widely expected to continue rolling out a steady stream of stimulus measures in coming months, though most economists believe it will hold off on more aggressive action such an interest rate cut unless conditions sharply deteriorate.
President Xi Jinping said on Sunday that the risks facing China's economy are "not that scary" and even if China's economy were to grow 7 per cent, that would still rank it at the forefront of the world's economies.
But signs are growing that the economy is continuing to lose momentum despite a raft of earlier stimulus measures, putting the government's official 2014 growth target of 7.5 per cent at increasing risk.
The producer price index fell 2.2 per cent from a year ago, its 32nd consecutive decline, as sluggish demand curbed the pricing power of companies, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
The market had expected a 2.0 per cent fall in producer prices after a drop of 1.8 per cent in September.
Many Chinese companies are already facing rising borrowing costs as banks grow more reluctant to lend.
Yu Qiumei, a senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics, said worsening factory price deflation in October was mainly caused by a drop in oil prices and over-capacity problems that have plagued some sectors for years.
China has cut retail prices of gasoline and diesel seven times in a row since late July as international oil prices fell.
"The worsening PPI weighed on the manufacturing industry, providing more evidence that China's economic growth will remain under pressure in 2015. Policymakers should take more measures to boost the economy," said Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai .
Nomura expects more forceful measures to come soon, predicting one, 50-basis-point cut in banks' reserve requirement ratio in each quarter from now into late 2015, in addition to more modest easing measures.
China's central bank pledged on Thursday to maintain modest policy support to help the economy in the near term but stressed that it will not flood markets with cash, which it fears may be funneled into speculative activities rather than the real economy.
An official survey released last week showed that the services sector grew at its slowest pace in nine months in October as the cooling property sector weighed on demand, adding to signs of fragility in the economy. A similar survey found factory activity fell to a five-month low.
Data on Saturday showed import growth slowed in October, adding to evidence of sluggish demand.

MUMBAI: Rail stocks surged and ITC posted the biggest intraday gain in 14 months as the Narendra Modi-led BJP government's first cabinet reshuffle boosted investor confidence about the pace and intensity of the government's reform programme.
The benchmark broader indices rose to an all-time high in morning trade before slipping to end the day marginally higher but the limelight was clearly on railway infrastructure stocks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed a leading reformist Suresh Prabhu to head the railway ministry.
Rail stocks rose by up to 9% on Monday led by Texmaco Rail, which jumped 8.98% to Rs 108, Kalindee Rail, which climbed 8.10% to Rs 110, and Titagarh Wagons, up 3.6% to Rs 268. All these stocks outperformed the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap Index which ended flat.
Shares of ITC jumped 4.3% toRs 370 as traders speculated that the new health Minister JP Nadda may not pursue more tax increases for cigarette companies or curbs on their advertisement and marketing. But some analysts said that the government may sell stake in ITC, now being held by the Special Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI). This is ITC's biggest intraday percentage jump since September 2013.
"The government has been providing positive and constructive news on consistent basis in terms of both its vision and how it wishes to implement it. The changes in cabinet are quite exciting," says Ashok Wadhwa, MD & CEO, Ambit Holdings.
The Sensex rose as much as 159 points in the morning session to a record 28,027.96, its fifth all-time high in six sessions, before ending flat at 27,874.73. The Nifty ended at 8,344.25, up 7 points. FIIs bought equities worth Rs 355 crore on Monday while domestic institutions sold equities worth Rs 315 crore as per the BSE provisional figures.
Prabhu, whose family controls the Mumbai-based Saraswat Bank and who was a minister in the 1999-2004 NDA government, was appointed railway minister in the Modi cabinet despite the objections of Shiv Sena, his erstwhile party. He is widely reputed to be a reformist with strong execution skills. "I don't think the government will ease tax rates for cigarette companies such as ITC going forward.
We rather believe that the government may consider selling its stake in ITC as Prime Minister Modi is pushing for more reforms," said Vinod Nair, head, fundamental research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. Analysts say there are a lot of expectations that there will be policy reform oriented announcements going ahead such as formulation of tenders and upgradation of current infrastructure.
"Railway infrastructure related stocks have surged on renewed expectations that the new cabinet minister will intensify capital expenditure and launch new railway projects which will boost earnings of these companies. Market participants are expecting some radical reforms in the upcoming railway budget scheduled in February," said Pankaj Pandey, head of research at ICICI Direct.
In August this year, the new government had notified foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence and railways infrastructure with a limit of 49% and 100%, respectively, through the automatic route in several areas. The cabinet expansion has given concrete signal to the markets on the government's focus on infrastructure ministries, said investment managers.
The Modi-government announced plans to introduce bullet trains on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad route and a nationwide diamond quadrilateral project comprising high-speed trains. Freight and industrial corridors to improve the country's infrastructure and create employment are also being planned. Analysts say some of these projects may soon take off with the new minister assuming charge.
"There are strong expectations that railways will be further opened up to foreign investments while more emphasis will be given by government to boost infrastructure, which may lead to re-rating of select companies. We would like to advise investors to be selective while making their portfolio investments," said Devang Mehta, senior vice-president & head, equity advisory, at Anand Rathi.
Railway infrastructure related stocks have been market darlings for the last one year with Stone India rising 288%, BEML rising 227%, Texmaco Rail climbing 198%. Titagarh Wagons has climbed 155% in the same period.

Samsung to build $3-bn smartphone plant in V...Samsung Electronics
(Samsung has been increasing…)
HANOI: South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has applied for a licence to invest $3 billion in building a second smartphone factory in northern Vietnam, a government official said on Monday.
Samsung Electronics Vietnam plans to build the factory in Thai Nguyen province, where it opened a $2 billion smartphone plant in March, said a senior official at the province's Planning and Investment Department.
"We are working on the project," said the official, confirming an earlier report by Dau Tu, a newspaper controlled by Vietnam's Planning and Investment Ministry. "There are still a few things to fix."
The official was not authorised to speak to media on the matter and so declined to be identified by name. Officials at Samsung Electronics in Vietnam and South Korea declined to comment.
Samsung has been increasing production in Vietnam to reduce costs and better compete with the low-priced smartphones of Chinese rivals in particular.
The company's latest move would bring its total investment pledges in Vietnam this year to around $11 billion, according to Dau Tu newspaper, whose controlling ministry oversees foreign investment.
Mobile phones and accessories became Vietnam's biggest cash earner last year, taking over textiles. In January-October this year, export revenue reached $19.2 billion, or around 15 per cent of the country's total.
Samsung's first smartphone plant in Vietnam, built with an investment of $2 billion, generated $1.9 billion in export revenue in its first four months of operation, according to the Thai Nguyen provincial government.
The government, in a statement earlier this month, said the company's total revenue is expected to jump more than 67 per cent to $13.4 billion next year from $8 billion projected for 2014.

Mumbai, Nov 10:  
Are you planning to be at the Adelaide Oval on February 15 to watch India take on arch rival Pakistan in the ICC Cricket World Cup?
Time is running out for this incredible encounter, which kicks off less than 100 days from now. The good news, however, is that tickets are still available for the India-Pakistan, India-South Africa and other high octane fixtures from travel agents approved by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
The bad news is that you may end up paying 40 per cent higher for travel packages if you do not book within the next 10 days.
The reason: Flight tickets between India and key cities in Australia and New Zealand are expected to soar in the next few weeks, said Shashank Shekhar Mishra, Founder and CEO of Sports Konnect, an ICC authorised sports management company.
“Adelaide (where India takes on Pakistan) is not as well connected compared to Sydney or Melbourne. Carriers with direct or one-stop connections to Adelaide are almost booked out for February 14,” he says.
World Cup fever is building up in a big way among cricket fans. It is not just the high-flyers but solo travellers, families and couples who are keen on getting a ringside view of the action. Travel packages from agents are priced upwards of Rs 1.2 lakh depending on the number of days and other inclusions.
“I know of middle-class families that have been saving since 2011 to be in Australia and New Zealand,” said Anant Roongta, Director of Fanatic Sports, another ICC-approved sports tours company. Cutting Edge Events and TUI-ICE are the other official travel agents for the World Cup.
According to Tourism Australia’s Country Manager (India and Gulf), Nishant Kashikar, at least 5000-6,000 cricket enthusiasts could travel from India for the games next year.
Travel agents say that enquiries from clients have doubled in the last one month. “Timing-wise its perfect as February-March is summer Down Under. Moreover, the Indian mindset is such that if one has come all the way to Australia, they would do New Zealand as well and combine it with the cricket,” says Roongta.
Mishra and Roongta declined to share the number of packages they can retail citing ICC regulations for travel agents.
Though tickets for the India-Pakistan game were sold out on the ICC Travel website as early as June, authorised travel agents still have enough inventory. After India-Pakistan, the next most sought after match is India-South Africa, scheduled to be held at Melbourne on February 26.
“We have already sold 40-50 per cent of the total inventory for the World Cup,” says Roongta.
Australia and New Zealand are leaving no stone unturned in ensuring a strong turnout of Indians for the mega event.
Shibani Phadkar, Senior Vice-President at Thomas Cook says the recent Trans-Tasman joint visa agreement (which grants travellers with an existing Australian visa, a visa on arrival at New Zealand during the World Cup period) will serve as a catalyst in stimulating demand. It will also ease documentation for Indians travelling to Australia and New Zealand, said Phadkar.
Tourism Australia is keen to forge media partnerships to showcase the country’s tourism during the mega event. It plans to promote incentive-driven travel for corporates who wish to reward their top performers with the experience of watching ‘live’ matches, says Kashikar.

Obama arrives in Beijing on Asia tourObama arrives in Beijing on Asia tour

Beijing, Nov 10:  
US President Barack Obama arrived in Beijing today for a regional summit, his first stop on a week-long Asian diplomatic tour.
Obama is due to meet new Indonesian President Joko Widodo this morning, and then address an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) meeting in the Chinese capital.
The president descended from Air Force One on an Air China staircase and was received by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
In Beijing, Obama will seek to reassure Asian nations of America’s commitment to the region at a time when China’s rising profile creates economic opportunity for its neighbours, but also trepidation about Beijing’s desire to exert more influence abroad.
After a formal meeting with the leaders of the 21-member APEC on Tuesday, Obama will stay on for a state visit to China, including talks with President Xi Jinping amid a range of tensions.
He will then travel to Myanmar to attend the East Asia Summit, held on the sidelines of a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), before heading for G20 talks in Brisbane, Australia.
Obama will also meet regional allies including Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese premier Shinzo Abe during the tour.
The president comes fresh from a major election setback at home and assailed on all sides by global crises, from Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria to the conflict in Ukraine and the deadly spread of the Ebola virus.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will be present in Beijing and Brisbane, but the Kremlin had said last week that no meeting between him and Obama had yet been scheduled.
Relations are at the lowest since the Cold War, with Russia under US-backed Western sanctions over its seizure of the Crimea this year and its role in the separatist war in eastern Ukraine.

Coast Guard to continue inducting new platforms‘Coast Guard to continue inducting new platforms’

Mangalore, Nov 10:  
The Indian Coast Guard will continue to induct newer platforms and build the support infrastructure for these new inductions, according to SPS Basra, Commander of the Western Region of the Indian Coast Guard.
Speaking at the commissioning of air cushion vehicles (ACVs) in New Mangalore on Monday, he said the proposed augmentation caters to the effective strength of 150 surface platforms and 100 aircraft by 2018. Induction of these assets in the service will strengthen the already existing capability of the Indian Coast Guard to respond to any challenges, he said.
On the coastal security exercises, he said regular conduct of security exercises involving all stakeholders had strengthened the coastal security mechanism. These initiatives have also resulted in increase in synergy among various agencies and helped to plug the lacunae in coordination.
He said the Coast Guard is in the process of setting up a Coast Guard air enclave in Mangalore in the near future. The real challenge for the Coast Guard in Karnataka will be to find a suitable place for berthing its assets.
He requested the State authorities to hand over land at Karwar on priority so that these ACVs could freely operate and provide assistance to fishermen in distress.

Shanghai, Nov 10:  
China stocks rose on Monday morning after regulators announced that the long-awaited pilot programme allowing cross-border investment between the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets will be launched on November 17.
The CSI300 index rose 27.67671 points, or 1.11 per cent, to 2,529.8297 in early trade, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 18.45701 points, or 0.76 per cent, to 2,436.628. The Hang Seng index added 524.61 points, or 2.23 per cent, to 24,074.85.
Mainland indexes had seen surging volumes in the run-up to the announcement, as investors poured money into long-neglected financial stocks on mainland exchanges, expected to be the primary recipients of investment from Hong Kong.
That helped push up the CSI300 financial services index up over 10 per cent since October 27, led by banks and mainland brokerages.
The move has also helped close the valuation gap between dual-listed companies, which are among the stocks eligible to be traded under the pilot's regulations. The A-H share index stood at 99.05 in morning trade, with 100 representing parity.

Sensex off from life-time high of 28 028Sensex ends flat after hitting all-time high of 28,028
Our Bureau/Agencies
Tweet
Mumbai, Nov 10:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session near flat after hitting all-time highs in early trade on heavy selling in capital goods and oil & gas counters, despite buying in FMCG and consumer durables sector stocks.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex ended at 27,874.73, up 6.1 points and the 50-share NSE index Nifty ended at 8,344.25, up 7.25 points.
Among BSE sectoral indices, oil & gas index fell the most by 1.29 per cent, followed by capital goods 1.01 per cent, banking 0.53 per cent and PSU 0.48 per cent. On the other hand, FMCG and consumer durables stocks were the star-performers and were up 2.81 per cent and 1.00 per cent, respectively.
ITC, Sun Pharma,Tata Power, Coal India and HUL were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were ONGC, Hindalco, Tata Motors, L&T and Axis Bank.
The Sensex resumed higher at 27,919.45 and firmed up further to an all-time high of 28,027.96 on the back of strong foreign capital inflows into the equity market coupled with mixed Asian cues. The CNX 50-share Nifty also hit a life-time high of 8,383.05.
Brokers said sustained foreign funds inflow and widespread buying by investors on hopes of acceleration in economic reforms process after Prime Minister Narendra Modi expanded his Council of Ministers, mainly buoyed the trading sentiment, lifting the key indices to new highs in early trade.
Domestic sentiment was also buoyed in early trade as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had yesterday said that the government will amend the tough land acquisition law.
European stocks inched higher early on Monday, reversing some of the previous session's losses, with Nutreco surging 14 per cent as SHV sweetened its takeover bid for the Dutch animal feed and nutrition company.
At 0850 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.3 per cent at 1,348.80 points, after losing 0.5 per cent last week.
Mixed trading was witnessed in the Asian markets after US jobs data pointed to solid economic growth, while China's export performance showed more resilience than some had expected.
US employers added 214,000 jobs in October, slightly below economists' median forecast of 231,000, but logging the ninth consecutive month of gains of more than 200,000, the longest stretch since 1994.

Blackmoney in foreign banks to return in a year: Subramanian SwamyLetters to  the editor
Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy expressed hope that the black money stashed in foreign banks would return to the country in about one year.
“We are optimistic that the black money stashed in foreign banks would return to the country in about one year time, much before the expectation of the people,” Swamy told reporters here.
Rejecting apprehension that the Centre was taking time on the matter of bringing black money back, Swamy said it was taking some time as about one million bank accounts have been opened by Indians in 70 odd countries.
About Rs 120 lakh crore were stashed in foreign banks, the senior BJP leader said.
On the National Herald case in which Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were named, Swamy said, “The Supreme Court in 2007 had given a direction to set up a special investigation team for the purpose. But, they did nothing till the NDA government came to the power.
“There has been an attempt to grab properties worth Rs 5,000 crore simply by forming a private limited company in the name of Young Indian Ltd by Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Motilal Vora and others,” Swamy said about the case initiated by him.
Stating that the paid off capital of the company was only Rs 5 lakh, Swamy alleged there had been fraud, breach of trust by manipulation.
“Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi own 76 per cent of the share on the private limited company,” he pointed out.
Swamy claimed that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, as majority shareholders of Young Indian Ltd (YIL), benefited from the acquisition of Associated Journals Ltd (AJL).

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty hit fresh lifetime highs on capital inflowsFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Both the indices – Sensex and Nifty – slipped into negative zone after hitting all-time highs in early trade on fresh selling, mainly in capital goods and refinery stocks, despite buying in FMCG and healthcare counters.
The Sensex resumed higher at 27,919.45 and firmed up further to an all-time high of 28,027.96 on initial strong buying on the back of strong foreign capital inflows into equity market coupled with higher Asian cues.
However, it failed to maintain this level and declined afterwards to 27,818.23, showing a loss of 50.40 points, or 0.18 per cent at 1100 hours.
The CNX 50-share Nifty also moved down by 16.25 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 8,320.75 after hitting life-time high of 8,383.05.
Major losers on the Sensex were – ONGC (1.70 per cent), Larsen (1.61 per cent), Hindalco (1.60 per cent), Tata Steel (1.46 per cent), Cipla (1.34 per cent) and Tata Motors (1.01 per cent).
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 2,537.13 crore, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.

Will change Land Acquisition Act  GST talks in last leg: FM Arun JaitleyNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Finance minister Arun Jaitley said on Sunday that the government would amend the stringent land acquisition law, even without the support of the opposition.
Speaking ahead of the oath-taking ceremony of new ministers at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Jaitley also expressed hope that reforms, including the passage of the long-pending Insurance Laws Amendment Bill that seeks to raise the FDI cap in the sector to 49 per cent, and the new indirect tax regime, the Goods and Services Tax, would be rolled out  soon.
“Some changes (in the Land Acquisition Act) may be necessary. We will first try to reach a consensus and if that is not possible we will go ahead and take the decision. We have opened up investments in various sectors. I do hope this (winter) session I will be able to pass the Insurance Bill,” he said at the India Global Forum meeting in Delhi.
The “obstacles” to land laws would have to be removed in order to implement the concept of smart cities in India, Jaitley said.
Smart cities have been a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development vision, and Jaitley kept aside Rs 7,060 crore for 100 smart cities in the 2014-15 budget.
The Land Acquisition Act was passed during the previous UPA regime after the BJP, then in opposition, backed it in Parliament.
The Act provides for “fair compensation” for acquiring farmland for industrial projects. However, states and corporates have been demanding a relaxation in the law which, they argue, has made acquisition very difficult, and hurt infrastructure projects.
The rural development ministry has already suggested a number of amendments to the Land Acquisition Act to ease the process of acquisition.
The finance minister also promised a “reasonable and rational” tax policy which, he said, would restore investor confidence and help make India a global manufacturing hub.
“One of the greatest challenges we have is the manufacturing sector. The economy had touched a new low and therefore the manufacturing sector itself is delicately poised in India. We have to eventually try and make India a hub of low-cost manufacturing,” he said.
One of the “principal challenges” before the government, the minister said, was to “restore confidence, expand economic activity and move towards increasing the growth rate”.
A “reasonable and rational tax policy” is needed, which “can’t be ultra-aggressive with the taxpayers”.
On the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the government’s most ambitious tax reform, Jaitley said the Centre was in the final stages of talks with states, and indicated that the Constitution Amendment Bill may be introduced in the upcoming session beginning November 24.
“I do hope that my friends in the opposition parties, particularly the principal opposition, after a wasted opportunity when they were in government, spend a more fruitful tenure when they are in opposition,” Jaitley said.
The minister also said the government’s disinvestment programme would unfold in the next couple of days, and that the government was aiming to bring down its equity in public sector banks to 52 per cent.

NAVs below launch value open up good entry point for gold fundsTARC seeks separate cell for the rich, tax  on 'large' farmers
Gold funds emulating the performance of gold have been the worst performing asset class over the last one year. While equities come on top and the Sensex at the Bombay Stock Exchange rose by over 33 per cent in the last one year, gold funds saw their returns shrink by an average of over 15 per cent in same period placing it at the bottom of the table. The net asset value of all the gold funds managed by mutual fund houses is trading at a 52-week low and importantly most of them are trading below their NAV values at the time of their launch. It is also for the first time in 14 years that gold has generated a negative return in a calendar year as the year to date prices of gold are down by over 12 per cent. While a significant decline in the prices of the yellow metal may seem as a good opportunity to invest and capitalise on the low prices of gold and at low NAVs of gold funds, experts point out a near term bearishness in gold and suggest that entry into gold only makes sense for those who are willing to invest for the long-term and not for those who want to make some quick money.
An ascending dollar has put pressure on gold globally. The improvement in prospects for US’ economy has strengthened the dollar and as the dollar index hit a seven-year high last week, it put further pressure on the precious metal. Since gold traditionally has an inverse relationship with the dollar, a rising dollar has forced investors to move out of the metal and into the currency thereby resulting in a sharp decline in gold prices globally. Internationally, gold prices have fallen by more than 35 per cent over the last two years. Even in India, on Friday, price of standard gold fell to a level of Rs 25,500 per 10 grams — its lowest level in over 17 months. Going by the rising dollar trend and expectations of its further strengthening on account of expected hike in interest rates in the US by the Federal Reserve by the middle of next year, in all likelihood, gold may continue to remain under pressure in the near term and it may not be a bad idea to start investing in it.
“While long-term investment makes sense, the short-term prospect of gold is not positive and therefore investors who are looking to make short-term gains should not get into it. A look into the performance of various asset classes over the last 12 years shows that different assets performed at different times and one does not know when the cycle may turn in favour of a particular asset class. Investors should therefore not look to time the market and start investing,” said Sundeep Sikka, CEO, Reliance Mutual Fund.
Price fall may lead to a surge in demand
Generally gold demand in India is price elastic, which means that when the prices come down, Indians line up to buy gold and with the marriage season approaching, demand for gold is set to rise. Lakshmi Iyer, head of fixed income and products at Kotak Mahindra AMC points out that while demand may pick up on account of the falling prices and the approaching marriage season, investors should not expect a rebound in gold prices in the immediate future.
“Investors can’t wish away gold at any time from their portfolio as it is the last man standing when everything is going down. While investors can invest up to 10 per cent of their asset into gold, they should not expect euphoric returns as seen in the past and the investments should be made with reasonable expectations,” said Iyer.
A recently released report by CARE Ratings also outlines that gold may get some support from a rise in demand from China and India.
“Increased buying from China and India could provide some cushion for prices. Gold markets could also get some support from higher physical buying at lower prices and from investors who seek portfolio diversification. Nevertheless, the metal is unlikely to see a significant resurgence in demand and the price in the near term is likely to hover around the $1,200/ounce range with a downward bias,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Care Ratings.
Gold ETF is the way to invest
Exchange traded funds are investment funds that are traded on the stock exchanges. In case of gold ETF’s, mutual fund companies invest in gold bullion and thus the ETF tracks the market price of gold. Over the last one year there has been a significant dip in gold prices which has brought the NAV value of gold funds even below their launch value and so those who missed on investing then, may utilise the opportunity available now. It is like the shares of a bluechip company trading below their IPO value and it opens up a good entry point to invest in them.
In India, gold buying in the physical form, especially jewellery, is inevitable. However, those looking to invest in gold for the long-term should avoid doing so in its physical form — either jewellery or bars and coins and instead go for it in its electronic form i.e. exchange traded funds. In case of jewellery purchase, while there are concerns around the purity of gold, investors also lose out on the making charges and other charges that may go up to 20 per cent. Also, while buying gold coins and bars from banks, the cost rises by around 10 per cent on account of brokerage, assaying cost etc. The issue with such purchases is that at the time of liquidation all the additional costs are non-recoverable along with issues of storage and security of the same.
In case of gold ETFs, there are no issues of purity and also the annual expense ratio amounts between 0.5 and 1 per cent which is significantly lower than the cost in case of other forms of gold investing. Additionally, ETFs can be easily liquidated since they trade on the exchange which is not so easy in case of coins.
“Through the ETF, investors can accumulate gold in a disciplined manner every month and it is a cost-efficient way of investing in gold,” said Sikka. While a demat account is required to invest in gold ETF, those who do not have a demat account can invest in Gold fund of fund schemes which do not require the need of having a demat account.

ICAI starts proceedings in Rs 870-crore Reebok scamcompany information
Chartered accountants’ apex body ICAI has started proceedings against a former Reebok India official for his alleged involvement in the Rs 870 crore scam at the sportswear maker that came to light in 2012.
The Rs 870 crore scam was allegedly committed by the company’s former managing director Shubhinder Singh Prem and former chief operating officer Vishnu Bhagat. The latter is a member of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).
A disciplinary committee of the institute is looking into the matter involving the company’ former CFO.
When contacted, ICAI President K. Raghu said the committee has started hearing in the matter.
“The Disciplinary Committee had held a hearing in the matter at Delhi in September, 2014, and further hearing has been adjourned to a later date,” Mr. Raghu told PTI.
Following reports about the scam, the institute took up the matter and had formed a “prima-facie opinion of guilt” against the concerned member.
Besides, the institute has received two separate complaints against the concerned auditors of Reebok India.
One case is being investigated by the Directorate in terms of the Chartered Accountants (Procedure of Investigation of Professional and Other Misconduct and Conduct of Cases) Rules, 2007.
The other matter is pending as it is sub-judice.
In March 2013, Adidas said its balance sheet for 2011 was negatively impacted by 153 million euros on account of commercial irregularities at its arm Reebok India. Adidas owns Reebok.

Arun Jaitley Vows to Push Land Purchase ReformYou are here: Home Industries
Finance Minister Jaitley Vows to Push Land Purchase Reform
Reuters | Updated On: November 09, 2014 11:28 (IST)
Government May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: The government will push ahead with reform to a land purchase law blamed by businesses for slowing industrial projects, even if there is resistance to loosening the rules, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Sunday.
Changes to the law were needed to fulfil Prime Minister Modi's vision of building 100 new "smart" cities across India, Mr Jaitley said.
"Some changes will be necessary, we will first attempt to reach a consensus, if that's not possible we will go ahead and take the decision," he said, speaking at a seminar in New Delhi.
The law was passed last year with support of Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party when it was in Opposition, and seeks to set fair compensation for loss of livelihood for farmers who sell their land to industrial or infrastructure projects.
But its complex procedures have made it very hard for large-scale industrial projects to acquire the land they need.
The BJP would need parliamentary approval to change the law, and might struggle in the upper house where it does not have a majority.
Mr Jaitley also said he hoped to begin a delayed programme to sell stakes in government-owned companies "in the next couple of days". He said the government was aiming to bring down its equity in public sector banks to about 52 per cent.

Take a look: Five world markets themes in the coming weekDespite dip, Indian rupee first among equals
Following are the five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of traders and investors in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.
1. HUBBLE BUBBLE, ROUBLE IN TROUBLE:  Russia’s currency, the rouble, is collapsing. It has depreciated for nine consecutive weeks, and fell 8 percent this week alone in increasingly volatile trade. The central bank on Friday tried to counter that volatility and speculation, saying it could intervene within minutes and without giving prior warning. But it alluded to the seriousness of the crisis, saying the currency’s weaknes is starting to worry the population. What is now a 30 percent drop this year is almost certain to send the dominoes toppling again in the neighbouring “rouble zone” of ex-Soviet states. There could be devaluations in store for the Kazakh tenge, the Belarus rouble and the Ukraine Hryvnia, because of those countries’ massive trade links with Russia. But if oil prices do stabilise, the Russian central bank might feel it is worthwhile inflicting a little bit of pain through intervention for those speculating against the rouble.
2. POLICY EASING:  It’s not just in emerging markets that exchange rate movements have started to dominate the economic and financial agenda. The Japanese yen has fallen 12 percent in three months to a seven-year low, and the euro is its weakest in over two years. The common thread is extraordinary policy easing — realized, in the case of the Bank of Japan, and expected, in the case of the European Central Bank. Weaker exchange rates may be good news for the BOJ and ECB, but a potential headache for the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury should the dollar continue to strengthen. And the dollar is the big global winner, not only against currencies weakened by their own central banks, but also against those hit by the collapse in oil and other commodity prices such as the Norwegian crown, Canadian dollar and South African rand. Competitive devaluations may not be on the official agenda at next week’s G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia. But they will no doubt be discussed on the sidelines.
3. POST-AQR BLUES:  The bank pain trade is getting … even more painful. Investors had bet on the European bank stress tests (Asset Quality Review) to draw a line in the sand for Europe’s banking sector and unleash a pick-up in loan demand, capital return and even M&A. Now investors are taking fright because of the one thing the stress tests did not take into account: the real possibility of deflation in the euro zone. With Italian banks like Monte Paschi forced to look for tie-ups or share sales to raise capital in the midst of a surge in market volatility, investors are being forced to yet again reassess their bets on the financial sector. Euro zone financials have fallen around 6 percent in the two weeks since the tests.
4. GDP WATCH: There seems little chance that euro zone growth data next Friday will do much to reduce pressure on European Central Bank president Mario Draghi to expand asset purchases to government bonds. Quarterly growth is seen at just 0.1 percent, the year-on-year figure little better at 0.7 percent. Euro zone bond yields are therefore set to remain subdued, with the only fly in the ointment Sunday’s “citizens’ consultation” vote in Spain’s wealthiest region Catalonia, where secessionists are seeking independence from Madrid. While fears about political fallout from the vote have eased somewhat as the poll will have no legal standing, a big turnout could fuel political tensions in Spain and push yields further above those for German benchmark Bunds and narrow the gap with the Italian equivalents.
5. STERLING WORK: The past couple of months may have seen a sea-change in markets’ expectations for UK interest rates but on the face of it there may still be plenty of room for another pushback. Next week’s quarterly inflation report from the Bank of England, allied to currently all-important monthly numbers on jobs and wages, might be the ideal time. There are two competing views of what is really happening in Europe’s second biggest economy.
Either Britain is still steadily recovering and, in the normal course of things, it is only a matter of time before that starts showing up in employees’ pockets and thereafter inflation. Or we are still in a situation where things are far from normal, no one is really feeling quite as confident as the government would hope going into an election year, and the euro zone’s malaise will keep a lid on prices for the foreseeable future. PMI surveys in the past week, while in places still positive, hinted at the latter. If wages and the BoE’s rhetoric continue in the recent vein, the August or September rate rise pointed to by money markets may look very precarious by midday on Wednesday.

Blow for Cameron as UK faces deeper cutsGavyn Davies Britain will be squeezed
The level of cuts are nearly twice the £25bn estimate because that figure does not include planned cuts for two years out of the nine – 2015-16 and 2018-19 – and takes no account of the effect on departmental spending of rising numbers of pensioners and increases in pension payments. The Institute for Fiscal Studies last month criticised Mr Cameron for omitting the first and last year of the next parliament when calculating the size of the cuts to be made.
Even if the chancellor manages to cut welfare payments by another £12bn a year , as he promised in January, this would not be enough to prevent deeper overall cuts for government departments during the next parliament.
In the March Budget documents, data show that after taking account of inflation, the coalition cut annual day to day spending by government departments by £25bn between 2009-10 and 2014-15.
The Conservatives plan to increase the pace of these cuts over the next parliament, removing another £48bn from the total, reducing the total spent in departments from £312bn in 2014-15 to £264bn in 2018-19.
So far, the public sector has coped better than many expected. But with employees more restless about slow wage growth and the easier cuts already achieved, many experts think taxes are more likely to rise than fall after the next election to protect public services and keep the deficit falling.
The OBR and the Treasury have seen the FT’s findings but both declined to comment.

Prabhu joins BJP online before taking oath

TOPICS
national politics
The Bharatiya Janata Party’s instant online membership came in handy on Sunday when the former Shiv Sena member, Suresh Prabhu, was inducted into the party just before the swearing-in.Mr. Prabhu took oath as a Cabinet minister.
The Shiv Sena disowned Mr. Prabhu as its nominee for the Cabinet while the party’s official candidate, Anil Desai, was summoned back to Mumbai from Delhi airport. The Shiv Sena maintains that it was assured of two Cabinet berths including Union Minister Anant Geete, but Mr. Desai was made only a Minister of State, which the party rejected.
BJP sources said only a MoS was offered to the Shiv Sena for now.
However, while the Sena flip-flop was on and Mr. Desai was cooling his heels at the Delhi airport, the BJP quietly made Mr. Prabhu an online member. A Press Information Bureau release later said that Mr. Desai could not be administrated oath of office “because he was not available for the purpose.”
Similarly, the party made Ajatshatru Singh, son of Congress leader Karan Singh, an online member when it inducted him into the party on Sunday in the presence of BJP president Amit Shah. After presenting him a bouquet, Mr. Shah suggested that Mr Singh, his wife Ritu and son Rajvijay Singh, become online members using their mobile phones. Even as he was on the dais, Mr Singh dialled a toll-free number and became member No. 1004671837.

LPG subsidy fixed at Rs 568  cooking gas price to change after MarchNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office has fixed the subsidy on domestic LPG at Rs 568 per cylinder —  to be borne equally by the government and national oil companies (NOCs) —  setting the stage for deregulating the pricing of domestic cooking gas.
However, the Prime Minister’s Office on October 22 also decided to keep the consumer price unchanged during the current fiscal year ending March 2015 after which the deliverable price could vary with the change in international price.
At the meeting, the PMO fixed the subsidy for domestic LPG at Rs 40 per kg (or Rs 568 per cylinder of 14.2 kg) to be shared between government and public sector upstream oil companies Oil & Natural Gas Corp, GAIL India and Oil India Ltd.
“Retail selling price of LPG would remain fixed up to March 2015 and any variations in procurement price of LPG by oil marketing companies (OMCs) will be adjusted through fixed compensation of Rs 20 per kg by the government and the balance Rs 20 per kg by upstream national oil companies,” says the proposal for the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA).
“Difference in subsidy admissible from NOCs and actual subsidy will be used when actual requirement of subsidy exceeds Rs 568 per cylinder…
The position of actual subsidy requirement would be reviewed in March 2015,” it adds.
Under the system put in place by the UPA government, consumers were allowed 12 subsidised cylinders without any limit on how much loss would be borne by the OMCs.
The actual subsidy thus paid for consumers used to change in order to keep the price fixed at the level approved by the CCPA.
The CCPA proposal prepared by the petroleum ministry says that the PMO also decided that Rs 568 be transferred as the first time “permanent advance” to LPG consumers when the fixed subsidy scheme is launched in 15 districts from November 15 to cover the entire country by January 1, 2015.
The Modi government on October 18, when it decontrolled diesel pricing, announced a re-launch of the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme for LPG (DBTL) as part of fuel reforms. “Under the modified DBTL scheme, the subsidy on a domestic subsidised cylinder will be fixed,” an official statement had said.
When contacted, petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said any surplus to the OMCs would be kept in a pool account and would be set off against higher international prices in future.
The proposed fixed subsidy is higher than current under-recovery of Rs 416.35 per cylinder but prices were expected to harden in the winter months of November to February, he added. The CCPA note on finalising the burden sharing mechanism for under-recovery of Rs 92,251 crores on sale of LPG, diesel and kerosene also proposes that:
Subsidy burden of Rs 10,821 crores on diesel until October 18 and Rs 28,382 crores on kerosene for fiscal 2014-15 be shared equally between the government and the upstream NOCs with the ratio of sharing between the NOCs to be separately decided by the petroleum ministry.
Oil Industry Development cess of Rs 10,500 crore paid by ONGC and OIL on crude oil production from nominated fields be considered a part of the ONGC and OIL’s burden share in fiscal 2104-15 since the collected cess was not being transferred for the intended purpose of development of the oil industry.
DEREGULATION SOON
* The PMO fixed the subsidy for domestic LPG at Rs 40 per kg to be shared between government and public sector upstream oil firms
* After March, the deliverable price could vary with the change in international prices

Bihar polls on mind  3 more get Narendra Modi berthsGiriraj Singh, MoS for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, belongs to Bhumihar caste.
Written by Santosh Singh | Patna | Posted: November 10, 2014 2:13 am | Updated: November 10, 2014 5:44 am
With the induction of three more ministers from Bihar in the council of ministers — Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Giriraj Singh and Ram Kripal Yadav — the state now has seven ministers including one each from NDA partners, Ramvilas Paswan (LJP) and Upendra Kushwaha (RLSP).
As per the caste equation, BJP, which has 22 MPs from the state, has allotted ministries to four upper castes and one OBC Yadav. The three of the four prominent upper castes represented are Rajputs, Bhumihar and Kayastha. Brahmin, considered the core constituency of the BJP among the upper castes, has been left unrepresented, which is why Buxar MP and prominent Brahmin leader Ashwini Kumar Choubey does not count himself out before any future cabinet expansion ahead of next year’s Assembly elections.
Sunday’s expansion makes it clear that BJP wants to convey that its “social coalition of upper castes is intact” after the “initial confusion of Bhumihars being left out” — only Radha Mohan Singh (Rajput) and Ravishankar Prasad (Kayastha) were inducted from Bihar when Narendra Modi took oath as PM in May.
BJP sources said the party had been looking at the “right choices” and upper caste consolidation with the inductions of Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Giriraj Singh.
“While Rudy comes with previous administrative experience at the Centre, his victory over Rabri Devi (RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s wife) added weight to his resume. That he is a prominent Rajput leader who always dared to challenge Lalu Prasad also goes strongly in his favour,” a BJP leader said,adding that Giriraj Singh now represents Bhumihars at the Centre, a political move that will keep the caste group “committed to BJP” amidst JD(U)’s bid to woo them with a fair representation in the Jeetan Ram Manjhi government.
With the Bhumihars reportedly not voting for JD(U) in the last Lok Sabha elections, the BJP sees all the more reason to consolidate upper caste votes, which constitute 13 per cent of the state’s population.
With Pataliputra MP Ram Kripal Yadav’s induction, BJP looks to throw direct posers to Lalu, whose votebank is now threatened. Ram Kripal, who had been a trusted Lalu aide before the last Lok Sabha elections and a sworn Modi critic, is now projected as BJP’s arsenal against the RJD.
Social scientist and Asian Development Research Institute member secretary Shaibal Gupta explained to The Indian Express: “BJP has now been trying a social coalition of major sections of upper castes and OBC Yadavs along with its traditional Vaishya votebase against Nitish Kumar’s successful NDA days’ coalition of extremes – upper castes and Dalits”. He added that BJP had been “engaging politically muscular castes like Rajputs, Bhumihars, Yadavs and Paswans who may influence voting pattern of other social groups” like EBCs. He said that Dalit leader Ramvilas Paswan and OBC continued…

Newly appointed Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday assumed charge of the office.
Jaitley, who also holds the finance portfolio, was given the charge of the information and broadcasting ministry in a cabinet reshuffle that took place Sunday.
He took over from Prakash Javadekar , who now remains the minister of state (independent charge) for environment, forest and climate change ministry.
Speaking after assuming charge, Jaitley said: "Earlier too, I have remained the information and broadcasting minister, but then print media was more and very little electronic media. But now radio, digital media have grown tremendously."
"There was a time when most work of this ministry was done by Prasar Bharati and Doordarshan. But now we have to look at them as per the changes in information technology," Jaitley added.
Along with Jaitley, Olympian shooter-turned-politician Rajyavardhan Rathore, who has been made the minister of state for information and broadcasting, also took charge.
I&B ministry is an important ministry that communicates with all other ministries, Jaitley said and added he would devote some time every day at I&B, apart from his responsibility as the finance minister .

Bond market expects RBI to cut ratesSuvashree Choudhury and Gaurav Pai     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 16:26 IST
RBI governor Raghuram  Rajan.
The rally in bonds is providing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan an unexpected gift: Falling borrowing costs are starting to provide the benefits of lower interest rates without him actually having to ease monetary policy.
The bond rally - and the lower yields that result - comes as the consumer price index eased to 6.46 per cent in September.
That was the lowest since the series was introduced in January 2012 - a major morale boost for the fixed-income market and its legendary fear of inflation.
Investors are also more confident on the economy after a sharp turnaround in the rupee, the best Asian performer so far in 2014, gaining about 0.7 per cent to 61.53 to the dollar, and bucking a falling trend among its peers.
Despite no change in interest rates, India's largest lender, State Bank of India, last week became among the latest to lower deposit rates, often a precursor to lower lending rates, something some banks have already done for certain consumer loans.
Corporate bond yields have fallen sharply, making it 55 basis points (bps) cheaper for companies to issue bonds than a couple of months ago, bankers said. A 10-year AAA corporate bond is trading at around 8.75 per cent compared with 9.30 per cent just a few months ago.
That is working in Rajan's favour, easing pressure on the RBI to immediately cut rates and allowing him to uphold his hawkish reputation on inflation.
"There is an anticipation of easing by RBI materialising earlier than later and that is triggering the rate cuts by banks and softening in market yields," said Siddhartha Sanyal, India economist at Barclays in Mumbai.
Bond markets are now pricing in a cut in the key repo rate to 8 per cent as early as the RBI's next meeting on December 2 or in February - whereas previously expectations were for an easing in the second quarter of 2015.
As a result, the 10-year bond yield hit this week a 15-month low of 8.19 per cent. The one-year interest rate swap - an indicator of policy rates - fell nearly 37 bps last month, the biggest monthly fall in a year and is now trading at 7.96 per cent.
Meanwhile, cash conditions remain loose, allowing lenders to lower deposit and lending rates because they can access short-term funds more cheaply.
State Bank of India last week lowered some of its deposit rates by 100 bps, having already cut its home loan rates by about 15 bps in August.
CAUTION
For market borrowing costs to fall before a cut in official rates is a marked change in a country where banks often take months to react to changes in official rates.
This shift means any RBI rate cut would be passed through to the domestic economy much faster this time around.
That is critical, given that boosting credit growth, which touched a 13-year low in September, is a key plank in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to revive investment. Lower market borrowing costs also reduce pressure on the RBI to cut interest rates at a time when the economy has suffered from two consecutive years of below 5 per cent growth, a relatively low pace for India.
Rajan has argued repeatedly that economic growth can only revive by defeating inflation. The former International Monetary Fund economist has tried to do that by raising interest rates three times since September.
"Lower interest rates are good for growth. If the reform process by the government, which has already started, continues and is accompanied by lower policy interest rates, then the combination will help growth pick up faster," said Sanjay Mathur, head of economic research for non-Japan Asia at Royal Bank of Scotland in Singapore.
Union Bank of India Ltd, for example, said it was already prepared to lower lending rates after recently reducing deposit rates by 25-30 bps for some maturities to 8.75 per cent.
"Once RBI cuts the repo rate, banks are likely to follow with base rate cuts to push credit," said Arun Tiwari, chairman and managing director at Union Bank of India.
The worry for markets is an unexpected pick-up in inflation, such as via a sudden surge in crude oil prices, that would keep interest rates high for much longer than currently expected, given Rajan's intent to get CPI to 6 per cent by January 2016.
The RBI said after its September 30 policy meeting that it expects inflation to pick up by year-end as the base effect wanes. Food prices also typically rise in the run-up to the monsoon months.
"In India we have seen this play out several times: policy tightens, inflation declines, policy is loosened in response which spikes inflation. I think RBI wants to avoid repeating this mistake," said Jahangir Aziz, chief emerging-Asia economist at JP Morgan.

What Modi s new recruits Parrikar  others bring to the tableNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Prime Minister Narendra Modi undertook an expansion of his council of ministers and reshuffled portfolios while bringing in 21 new faces. Among them, Manohar Parrikar got Defence Ministry, Suresh Prabhu will head the Railway Ministry, J P Nadda has been given Health and Rajiv Pratap Rudy has been made MoS (Independent charge) for Skill development.
Here is what these new recruits bring to the table:
Manohar Parrikar
From being the first IITian to become a CM, technocrat-turned-politician Manohar Gopalkrishna Parrikar has come a long way. The 59-year-old RSS pracharak, set to get the defence portfolio, will preside over the Modi government’s policy of indigensing defence production, a key component of the Make in India campaign.
As three-time Goa CM, Parrikar has earned the reputation of being a corruption-free administrator and a hard taskmaster. He had led a campaign against the Congress-led government on illegal mining in the state. His decision to reduce petrol prices by around R11 per litre and social schemes like ‘Ladli Lakshmi’ and ‘Grih Adhar’ made him hugely popular in the state. Parrikar has Modi’s trust as he had publicly backed the PM in the 2014 polls, but he is also known for his blunt talk — he once said the post-Godhra riots were a blot on Modi’s career even though he was not a part of it.
Suresh Prabhu
The Shiv Sena high command is certainly not pleased as Prabhu had long fallen out of favour with it. Notably, Sena MP Anil Desai failed to take oath amid talk that Uddhav Thackeray will pull out of the government in New Delhi and play Opposition in Maharashtra.
During Vajpayee’s reign, Prabhu held portfolios such as industry, environment and forests, fertilizers & chemicals, power, heavy industry and public enterprises. He was also chairman of Task Force for Interlinking of Rivers. As power minister, he took steps towards affordable power and introduced transparency in project bidding, among other things. He also spearheaded a project on improving efficiency of old power stations and lowering transmission losses. A qualified CA and banker-politician, Prabhu, 61, is in the good books of Modi. Despite the problems between BJP and the Sena, he was appointed as Modi’s ‘sherpa’ for the forthcoming G20 summit.
JP Nadda
One of the three prominent figures involved in BJP’s decision-making , Nadda enjoys the confidence of both Modi and party president Amit Shah. Born in Bihar, the 53-year-old Nadda has emerged as a strong figure from Himachal Pradesh, where he was member of the legislative assembly before entering the Rajya Sabha. An efficient lieutenant to Modi, Nanda is likely to be a bridge between the party and the government.
Nadda joined student politics inspired by the JP Movement. He was an active member of BJP’s student wing, the ABVP, where he won polls to become the Patna University secretary in 1977. Nadda served ABVP for nearly 13 years, holsing many key positions.
Though mild-mannered, Nanda is known as a hard taskmaster. He was a strong contender for the post of BJP president, but he extended full support to Shah after losing the race earlier this year.
Nadda has also served as health minister in Himachal Pradesh government.
Rajiv Pratap Rudy
A post-graduate in economics and a commercial pilot, Rudy worked his way up in politics with a decade of field work in rural Bihar to become the youngest member of the legislative assembly in 1990.
A member of the previous NDA government, he initially held the commerce and industry portfolio as a minister of state and, then, the civil aviation portfolio as a minister of state with independent charge. The 52-year-old tech-savvy politician also worked as an economics lecturer in Bihar.
In the early part of his political career, Rudy was president of the Chandigarh government college students union. During his work in Bihar, he was closely associated with the BJP’s youth wing as national vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.
Rudy has served in various political and Parliamentary panels, including the Committee on Patents (Second Amendment) Bill in 1999. During leisure, he engages in adventure sport and travel.

India may sign WTOs Trade Facilitation Agreement: StudypaperBy: Press Trust of India | Posted: November 10, 2014 3:47 pm
India may finally sign the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement following discussions with the US on the details of an indefinite “peace clause” on food security, according to a research paper discussing the effectiveness of the upcoming G20 summit.
The study paper by Melbourne-based think-tank Australia India Institute (AII) titled ‘The G20: Challenges and opportunities Ahead’, said following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US and his talks with US President Barack Obama, India may finally sign the agreement.
“As a part of a revised proposal, India and the US are reported to be discussing the details of an indefinite peace clause on food security until a permanent solution is found,” it said ahead of the G20 summit in Brisbane starting November 16. Prime Minister Modi is also attending the summit.
“A peace clause would give legal security to member countries and protect them from challenges under other WTO agreements,” the paper said.
It cited that the G20, with its Doha Lite package, ensured the success of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Bali Ministerial Meeting.
“Though the legal texts and technical parameters including rules are still to be finalised, the meeting succeeded in addressing the core concerns of emerging and developing countries on maintaining public stockpiles of food grains for sale to poorer citizens at subsidised prices beyond permissible subsidy limits, in anticipation of a permanent solution,” it said.
“Some obstacles remain. India is trying to stall implementation of the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), agreed to in Bali and has tied ratification of the agreement to a permanent solution to the contentious issue of public stockpiling of food grains,” it added.
The paper also highlighted that the G20 in Brisbane this month would be dominated by the issues of financial sector regulation, trade facilitation measures, protectionism, infrastructure investment and tax policy coordination.
“The G20, as a genuine summit of national leaders, can credibly implement meaningful measures. What is, however, desirable is a more focussed approach to increased economic growth across member nations, especially after the US financial crisis,” it said.
It also sought for strengthening the G20 and that it should be upgraded from a forum to an institution, in a bid to make implementating difficult measures such as structural reform easier and more effective.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to reinvigorate the postal department by linking it with booming e-commerce, IT and Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is scheduled to meet heads of Amazon India and Flipkart this week.
Amazon India Vice-President and Country Manager Amit Agarwal and Monique Meche , Vice President of Global Public Policy at Amazon are scheduled to meet Prasad tomorrow.
Flipkart co-founder and CEO Sachin Bansal is also expected to meet the minister on November 13, sources said.
They said the agenda of the meeting is to discuss the ways in which India Post, world's largest postal network, can be utilised by e-commerce players to deliver goods across the country.
Prasad, they said, is of the view that with its unparalleled rural reach, India Post would be best suited to offer delivery services to e-commerce players.
The government is also looking at using e-commerce to improve the efficiency of postmen, and contemplating ways to incentivise them for timely delivery of goods.
"The postmen are expected to get some reward for timely delivery of products, although its just an idea as of now," said a source.
India Post has over 1.55 lakh post offices of which more than 1.39 lakh are in the rural areas. On an average, a post office serves an area of 21.21 sq km and a population of 7,175 people.
According to market analysts, last-mile delivery of products ordered by online shoppers will figure as one of the major deciding factors for e-commerce firms like Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon and so on.
These firms offer one-day delivery to their clients and the demand is expected further intensify as they are investing hugely in logistics to ramp up their delivery system.
The opportunity in back-end logistics for online shopping segment is estimated to be about Rs 3,500-4,000 crore, a major part of which is last mile delivery.
According to a joint study by consultancy firm PwC and industry body Assocham, the size of the e-retail industry is poised to touch USD 10-20 billion by 2017-2020 and e-commerce firms are expected to spend up to USD 1.9 billion by 2017-2020 on infrastructure, logistics and warehousing.

(The proceeds would be used…)
NEW DELHI: Jindal Steel and Power is likely to list its Oman-based wholly-owned subsidiary Shadeed Iron and Steel LLC in Muscat Securities Market for raising around $ 500 million, said a company source.
The proceeds would be used to part fund its $ 2 billion proposed investment plan of the local firm to raise capacity by 2.5 million tonnes per annum over the next 3-4 years.
Naveen Jindal-led JSPL had bought Shadeed Iron and Steel LLC (Jindal Shadeed) in July 2010 from Abu-Dhabi's Al Ghaith Holdings for about $ 500 million. The capacity of the plant, the third largest in the Middle East , now stands at 2 mtpa.
"Listing of the company on the local bourse is aimed at raising fund for the proposed $ 2 billion expansion over the next 3-4 years to take its capacity to 4.5 mtpa," the official said.
The listing, which is aimed at raising about $ 500 million, may happen next year, he said.
Environmental clearance for the proposed expansion of the plant is likely to come in next 8-9 months and after that the company would start placing orders, looking at completing the expansion by end of 2017 or early 2018.
Jindal Shadeed has sufficient land for moving ahead with the plant expansion. Raw material for the expanded facility would not pose a problem in future, he said.
JSPL foresees a tremendous surge in demand for iron and steel in the gulf markets on huge infrastructure spending. It is now producing billets and rounds at the Oman facility and on course to set up 1.6 mtpa rebar mill, which was expected to be commissioned by September-October next year.
The official said the expansion plans are expected to proceed smoothly as the Gulf nation is determined to achieve its Vision 2020 of diversifying from oil as a major source of income to other allied activities such as metals, downstream oil and gas.

GSMA expects 250 mn broadband connections by...GSMA expects 250 million broadband connections in India by 2017
Muntazir Abbas, ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 02.56PM IST
(According to GSMA Intelligence,…)
NEW DELHI: The UK-based GSM Association (GSMA) that represents the GSM operators worldwide anticipates that India's broadband services user-base would grow to 250 million connections by 2017 and expects favourable policy decisions to augment broadband growth.
"We expect to see increased mobile broadband penetration in India, with over 250 million on either 3G /4G by 2017," GSMA India head Sandeep Karanwal to ET, adding that they expect new regime at the Centre to work closely with the telecom sector.
According to GSMA Intelligence, a research wing of the group, India's 3G and 4G broadband connections stood at 88 million by the quarter ended September 2014.
The telecom regulator, in its broadband services report card, puts broadband's month-on-month growth rate at 4.95%, with 60.87 million subscribers as of March 2014. State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. leads the combined wired and wireless broadband market with 27.54% share.
To ensure broadband vision becomes a reality, Karanwal said that it is vital to ensure affordability and create the necessary supportive ecosystem including a conducive and transparent regulatory environment, improved availability of spectrum at reasonable cost and affordable devices.
The top lobby group believes that the Narendra Modi-led government has an opportunity to reinvigorate the economy and particularly the telecom sector and the new regime must work with the mobile industry to maximize long-term private sector investment and growth.
GSMA, Karanwal said, is quite confident that the new policy leadership in India will provide a clear vision to identify opportunities, constraints and actions around the expansion of broadband services.
India's top five wireless broadband service providers in accordance with sector regulator data, as of March 2014 include Bharti Airtel (10.98 million), Idea Cellular (7.23 million), Reliance Communications (7.11 million), Vodafone (7.02 million) and BSNL (6.77 million).
Broadband is seen as a backbone for the India's ambitious 'Digital India' initiative and Rs 7,000-crore mega program to build 100 smart cities, besides many on-going e-Governance projects as well as robust eCommerce opportunity.
Recently, Google India managing director Rajan Anandan also reiterated that the Indian government should maximize broadband connectivity efforts so that it could become 'competitive nation' in the digital space.

India’s auto industry body defended domestic manufacturers’ safety record on Tuesday, after an international safety watchdog said cars made by Maruti Suzuki  and Nissan Motor had failed an independent crash test.
The latest clash between India’s carmakers and Global New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) — a consumer safety testing body —comes at a time when the country is preparing to overhaul its car safety rules to reduce road accidents.
Watchdog NCAP said this week that Maruti’s hatchback Swift and Nissan’s compact car Datsun Go showed a high risk of life-threatening injuries to occupants when crashed headlong into a stationary object at 64kmph. NCAP had already rattled the industry by failing five Indian-made cars in January.
Maruti Suzuki and Nissan have said they meet the country’s current safety standards and will keep up with required changes.
“It is just scaremongering,” said Vishnu Mathur, director general, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).
“Global NCAP can do what they want. We have our own safety road map that we are going to follow and are already following.”
Mathur said the UK-based agency had not considered that average speeds in India are lower than in the developed world, due to poor road conditions and heavy traffic.
To reduce traffic fatalities on roads, India’s new government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is planning to overhaul highway laws — its most ambitious effort since independence in 1947.
Part of the government’s overhaul is the Bharat New Vehicle Safety Assessment Programme, a ranking system that will include crash tests among other factors before giving cars star ratings.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday said companies are expected to pump in as much as Rs 14,000 crore for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities in 2014-15 and the amount will be increasing in subsequent years.
“… CSR alone in its very first year is going to contribute about Rs 14,000 crore into the (social) sector and that’s reasonably a large amount of money. This is going to increase year after year as corporate profits increase,” he said while speaking at a function organised jointly by the Jubilant Bhartia and Schwab foundations.
Under the new Companies Act, certain class of profitable companies are required to spend at least 2 per cent of their three-year average annual net profit for CSR activities.
The minister later gave India Social Entrepreneur of the Year 2014 award to Hanumappa Sudarshan of Karuna Trust.

NCAER lowers Indias GDP growth forecast for this year to 5 pctPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 5, 2014 5:36 am
The National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has lowered India’s GDP growth forecast to 5 per cent in the current financial year on weak economic fundamentals and uncertainties in growth prospects.
The economic think-tank in its earlier projection had suggested that the Indian economy was likely to grow at 5.7 per cent in 2014-15.
“NCAER is predicting a slower growth for the economy unlike other forecasts. The fundamentals of the economy remain weak with uncertainties prevail. The only redeeming feature is the weakening of inflation and FDI inflows.
“Whether that will help us revive our growth prospects will depend on a number of factors including revival of the external economy and the extent of damage on agriculture due to deficit rainfall,” it said in a release today.
NCAER said that the overall economy is looking weak with uncertain growth prospects.
“The economy is giving mixed signals. On one hand, we had the Sensex reaching record levels partly driven by record foreign institutional investment and FDI.”
However, the business confidence index is showing rise in sentiments on the back of a stable political regime with the new government, it said.
Weakening of prices due to cheaper food and fuel inflation is also positive, but agricultural growth is predicted to be lower than last year as there was deficit rainfall with uneven spatial and temporal patterns.
“The pace of growth shows signs of slowing down in the services sector. Not surprisingly, bank credit to the commercial sector has not picked pace and continues to languish.
“Further, the slowdown in the external economy, except the United States, shows little growth prospects for the external sector even though exports grew in the first quarter,” it said.

BSESensex breaches 28 000-mark; Nifty at 8 363.65The 30-share index flared up by 141.57 points, or 0.50 per cent, to hit a new peak of 28,001.95. (Reuters)

The benchmark BSE Sensex breached 28,000-mark for the first time and the NSE Nifty hit a new peak of 8,363.65 in early trade today on sustained fund inflows amidst optimism over encouraging corporate earnings.
Besides, falling global crude oil prices which dipped to its lowest closing point since October 2011 also influenced trading sentiments, brokers said.
The 30-share index flared up by 141.57 points, or 0.50 per cent, to hit a new peak of 28,001.95, surpassing previous intra-day record of 27,969.82 reached on Monday.
The gauge had shed 5.45 points in the previous session. Markets remained closed yesterday on account of “Muharram”.
All the sectoral indices, led by realty, consumer durables and power, were trading in positive zone with gains up to 1.50 per cent.
Breaching all previous records, the 50-share NSE Nifty gained 39.50 points, or 0.47 per cent, to hit a new lifetime high of 8,363.65. It had touched the intra-day lifetime high of 8,350.60 on Monday.
Marketmen said persistent inflow of foreign funds and sustained buying by retail investors, buoyed by a series of economic reforms undertaken by the government and better-than-expected earnings by blue-chip companies, lifted the key indices to new highs.
Prominent gainers among the 30 Sensex stocks were Bajaj Auto, BHEL, Cipla, ITC, L&T, SBI, Sun Pharma, TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Power.
Among other Asian markets, Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.21 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.62 per cent in early trade today.
The US Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.10 per cent higher in yesterday’s trade.

Even as indices touch new highs  IPOs remain coolPrint
Written by Sandeep Singh | New Delhi | Posted: November 5, 2014 2:39 am
The near-absence of initial public offerings despite a 32 per cent jump in the benchmark Sensex at the Bombay Stock Exchange in the calendar 2014 seems to be an aberration of sorts, as rising indices in the past have led to hectic activity in the primary market with companies lining up public issues and getting listed.
Monthly IPO data accessed from Prime Database shows that the 10-month period ended October 2014, saw only four companies coming out with their IPO to raise a total of Rs 850 crore even though the stock markets jumped by over 30 per cent.
Against this, past years saw a jump in the IPO activity in line with the rise in equity markets. In the other three calendar years in the past — 2006, 2007 and 2009 — when the equity markets rose by over 30 per cent a large number of companies queued up with their issues and raised over Rs 19,000 crore.
While the maximum number of IPOs numbering 100 came in the year 2007 (raising Rs 34,179 crore), the year 2010 saw 64 companies raising an aggregate of Rs 37,534 crore, the highest in a calendar year.
The benchmark Sensex however had risen by only 17.4 per cent in 2010 and the momentum that picked up in 2009 after a sharp revival in markets continued in 2010 resulting into huge IPO mobilisation.
The IPO activity this year has been subdued and has defied the experts’ view that the bull run in the equity markets in India is here for the long run. However, there is hope for a revival in the IPO market.
The CEO of a leading investment banking firm, who did not wish to be named said that a regulatory check is doing a nice filtering job and is raising multiple queries in the approval process to safeguard the small investor.
“Both the regulator and the investors have become smart. The regulator is doing a close check of all the companies coming up with their issues. Free pricing is not allowed anymore and good businesses with good governance and right pricing only seem to be getting the regulator’s nod and that is a filter stopping too many companies to come with their public offering,” said the official.
There are others who feel that the IPO activity is set to witness a revival as several merchant bankers are in the process of filing the offer documents with the regulator.
The month of September witnessed 9 companies file their offer documents with the Securities and Exchange Board of India to raise over Rs 3,500 crore and are awaiting the awaiting the regulators nod.
November and December are expected to see a significant rise in the number of IPO draft document filings with the regulator.
“While the disinvestment activity is expected to take off in the balance part of the fiscal 2014-15, several banks are also currently working on IPO mandates of various private sector companies…and these are expected to be filed with the regulator in the coming months. The period between January and continued…

Special Arrangement New film Aakko has released posters that features Anirudh Ravichander.
TOPICS
arts, culture and entertainment
…but much cause to celebrate. It’s a coming of age of sorts for Kollywood poster boy Anirudh Ravichander, with big-budget Kaththi and his first Bollywood film. vishal menon catches up
I was struggling to get in touch with Anirudh. After innumerable tries, I got a call one day from an unknown number. True Caller said the call was from ‘Music King’. Intrigued, I picked up the phone. “Buddy,” said the voice. “Anirudh here. This is my new number… why don’t you come home tomorrow for the interview? See you at 7.” That’s Anirudh for you… he might take a bit longer than everyone else but he always comes through with a bang.
 
Kaththi, a really big break seems to have happened quite early in your career. How was it working with A.R. Murugadoss?
We met only once at a hotel when Murugadoss asked if I would work with him on his next film with Vijay. Later, when we started work, I asked him why he chose me. He said he was so surprised to see a music director being applauded when the credits rolled after Ethir Neechal. He also noticed how the kids in his apartment complex were singing my songs from Vanakkam Chennai. That’s when he decided to work with me and we gel well as a team. That’s perhaps why he also signed me on for his next Hindi film with Fox Studios, on which work will start in January.
Tell us about Vijay. Were you asked to compose a number specifically for him?
Vijay sir wanted to record at 9 a.m. (Laughs) I’m hardly up at that time. I had sent him a scratch version of ‘Selfie Pulla’. When he came to record, I realised he had already rehearsed it a few times. It was really nice to see such a busy person take the trouble. We finished recording the number in under an hour. The idea of a song for Vijay sir was there from the start. And when I travelled to Singapore for a concert, I noticed how crazy everyone was about selfies. I got the idea of ‘let’s take a selfie’ as the hook line for a song. I returned to Chennai and composed it. Of course, Vijay lent his character to it.
Your songs are quickest to touch the one-million mark on YouTube. It’s as though you know the magic formula.
I think I have a subliminal connection with YouTube (laughs). It’s one of the major reasons I’m here. My listeners are generally aged below 30, and they’re the ones busy on social networks. The future is there and I’m glad I have a base on the Internet, especially when CDs are becoming outdated. Another thing that might have worked in my favour is the length of my songs. Of the forty-odd songs I’ve composed, there are just four or five that exceed four-and-a-half minutes. Most are between three and three-and-a-half minutes. That’s how English songs are.
But Internet successes are also short-lived. Don’t people forget the songs as fast?
No, not really. The radio extends life. By the time a song touches one million views, another set of people starts downloading it or listening to it on the radio.
You’ve a reputation for taking a long time to compose songs.
It’s been three years and I have done just 40-odd songs for six films. After 3, I could have gone on a signing spree and made a lot of money, but I didn’t. It’s true I take a long time to compose songs. I make tunes every day, but they don’t necessarily work. I listen to a song several times to see how I can improve it even if it means flouting deadlines. Only when I’m 100 per cent satisfied, do I play it to the director. So for every song I’ve composed, there are hundreds and thousands of songs that have been discarded. I do just two or three films a year. I did three films in 2014 and I feel that’s a bit much. (Laughs) I want to cut it down to two. Having said that, I must apologise for the delays I have caused.
Your films release with ‘An Anirudh Musical’ written in bold. New film Aakko has released posters that feature you alone — even when you’re not acting in it.
Somehow they’ve given me that place and all I can do is work hard and offer better music. The name and fame I got initially was just too much to handle, but I’ve learnt to deal with it. About publicity, I don’t know how that works. I think it’s the age. If I was 40 and making the same kind of music, I’m sure the craze wouldn’t have been there. I’m glad success has come early.
Tell us about BGM. Is the process different from composing songs?
Background music is not well recognised in our country. Right from my first film, I’ve made it a point to release all my background scores and try to add one or two themes to the album. That’s because the work that goes into BG is much more than what goes into songs. Songs are usually just your imagination, but the score has to work with the scene and what the director wants to convey. The first few months of making a film is all about travelling with the songs and the emotions in them. Later, once the film gets ready, you sit down and see how to enhance each scene reel by reel. That gives you a very different high.
Your compositions continue to feature Vishal Dadlani, Yo Yo Honey Singh, Hiphop Tamizha...
Some people really excite you. When you work with them, you know the session is going to be something else. With Vishal, Honey and Aadhi, the sessions are just electrifying. Once you experience that, you crave for more and so I keep going back to them. The fact that like me they all come from the independent scene gives me a kick. But it’s also time I started looking for new singers.
But you’ve also worked with Yesudas, S. Janaki, Deva...
If working with the younger lot is electrifying, working with the legends is more of a divine feeling. When I work with them, I feel their blessings are with me. I believe that will take me forward.
Can you imagine doing something else? We heard you were a great student...
In the film field, it is easy to get carried away with people around you saying ‘you’re killing it…’ ‘you’re rocking it…’ But my friends have kept me grounded all along. They tell me to my face if a song is good, bad or awful. People think I’m only close to Dhanush and Sivakarthikeyan because I’ve worked with them more than once. But my actual ‘gang’ of friends is a bunch no one knows. As for studies, I always did my exams well but that’s because I was a master at copying not because I studied well. (Laughs)
Do directors still come to you and say, ‘Anirudh, I want one more ‘Kolaveri’?
Not anymore. I wouldn’t do it. That’s done and dusted. Now it’s about going forward. Honestly, I want to get rid of the ‘Kolaveri’ tag as soon as possible.
There were rumours of you getting into acting. You feature in some of your own music videos?
I enjoy shooting for videos as long as it’s just for two or three days. But when it takes longer, I realise I can’t think beyond the sets, how I’m going to dance, and how I look. Eventually, these too are about music and taking it forward. That’s why I didn’t want to get into acting. Making music also takes a lot of time, effort and pain but it’s more enjoyable.
Music is mysterious in the way it takes shape. I have no idea where the tunes come from or if they are going to work at all. At the end of the day, you make a song and play it in your car when you’re driving back home. Nothing feels better than that moment.

Manual hijack of accounts leads to severe financial loss: GoogleEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Cybercriminals are now spending more time in devising targeted attacks on individuals to make significant financial gains instead of launching widespread automated attacks, says tech giant Google.
Incidents of manual hijacking — where professional attackers spend considerable time exploiting a single victim’s account — are still rare at about nine incidents per million users per day, but the impact can be severely damaging, Google said in a study.
“The damage manual hijackers incur is far more severe and distressing to users and can result in significant financial loss,” it added.
Google said these “needle-in-a-haystack” attacks are very challenging and represent an ongoing threat to Internet users.
Manual hijackers often get into accounts through phishing attacks by sending deceptive messages meant to trick users into handing over username, password and other personal information.
“Of the hijacking case samples we analysed, we found that most of the hijackers appear to originate from five main countries: China, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Nigeria, and South Africa,” it said.
The study found that criminals attempted to access 20 per cent of the accounts within 30 minutes of attack. Once logged in, manual hijackers profile the victim’s account and spend an average of three minutes to assess the value of the account before exploiting it or abandoning the process.
It added: “This step entails searching through the victim’s email history for banking details or messages that the victim had previously flagged as important. We also see attackers scanning through email contacts which are then either solicited for funds or targeted with a salvo of targeted phishing emails.”
Google said that using a second authentication factor like a phone, has proven the best defence against hijacking.
“While second factor authentication has some drawbacks, we believe that it is the best way to curb hijacking long term,” it added.

Industry: Cabinet expansion would usher in economic reformseconomy, business and finance
Industry chambers on Sunday welcomed the Cabinet expansion saying the development signals a serious intent on the part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for faster decision-making process and kicking in reforms.
“The induction of new (Cabinet) Ministers and Ministers of State would streamline governance and bring in new ideas for the economic reforms process,” said CII president Ajay Shriram.
Several of the Ministries were under a single Minister, and industry was widely expecting the expansion of the Cabinet at an early date, he added.
“The Cabinet expansion sends out a strong signal that the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is serious about accelerating the reforms process,” he said.
Another industry body Assocham said the expansion of the Cabinet would surely add new vitality to the government.
“The fact that some of the key portfolios will now have full time Cabinet Minister in-charge will provide speed to the decision-making in important sectors of the economy,” it said in a statement.
“Besides, induction of some leaders in the Cabinet, who enjoy clean image and are known for efficient functioning, has also sent a signal about the non-compromising attitude of the Prime Minister when it comes to these attributes,” it added.

AirAsia India joins airfare war  offers one-way ticket for Rs 699Editorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
AirAsia India today joined the domestic airfare war launching a week-long sale offer for its entire network with one-way tickets with prices as low as Rs 699 including taxes.
The move came as part of its Malaysian parent company AirAsia presenting a ‘Big Sale’ with three million promotional seats on its network from Kuala Lumpur, with a starting fare of Rs 2,599 for international flights operated by AirAsia Berhad and Thai AirAsia, the airline said in a release.
The Indian carrier is offering “an all inclusive one way fare” starting from as low as Rs 699 for flights from Bengaluru to Chennai, Kochi, Goa, Jaipur and Chandigarh and vice versa.
The Malaysian parent company’s offer of Rs 2,599 would be available on flights from Chennai, Kochi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Tiruchirappalli and Hyderabad to Kuala Lumpur operated by AirAsia Berhad and Chennai to Bangkok flown by Thai AirAsia, the release said.
The tickets can be booked on Airasia’s website from tonight till November 16, for travel period from June 10 next year to January 17, 2016, it said.
AirAsia India CEO Mittu Chandilya said “it is our constant endeavor to make air travel affordable for every Indian.”
He said the ‘Big Sale’ offer would “allow our guests to plan their travel early with extremely low fares.”
All Indian airlines have been competing with each other to fill up vacant seats, especially during the lean seasons, by offering low fares throughout the year.

From Goa  to help Modi make in IndiaPrint

Written by Liz Mathew , Shalini Nair | New Delhi/panaji | Posted: November 10, 2014 3:08 am | Updated: November 10, 2014 9:15 am
Manohar Gopalkrishna Prabhu Parrikar is known to have been handpicked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he wants the defence ministry to play a crucial role in his “Make in India” program. Parrikar, who has the backing of the RSS too, has seen his stock rise after winning a majority in Goa where political instability was frequent. A taskmaster and a strategist, Parrikar is known for his blunt talk — he reportedly referred to L K Advani as “old rancid pickle” and later had to clarify what he meant — and the way he controlled his Goa cabinet. One of Modi’s closest aides, he was among the first leaders to urge the BJP to announce Modi as PM candidate ahead of the elections. Besides, party insiders say, he “pleased” Modi with his candid remark that the 2002 Gujarat communal violence had been a mistake and that Modi had never allowed such violence to recur.
In his home state, a giant screen was propped up outside the BJP office, where party workers, corporators and Parrikar’s personal staff sat huddled together since noon. As Parrikar appeared on screen, they leapt off their chairs cheering, distributing sweets and lighting firecrackers.
“It is very mixed feelings for us. Yesterday we were sad he is abruptly leaving Goa, today we are proud to see him inducted in the cabinet,” said Sheetal Naik, corporator from Panaji.

Deoband backs Swachh Bharat Abhiyan  not ModiPrint
Written by Mohd Faisal Fareed | Lucknow | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:01 am
Darul Uloom Deoband, India’s largest Islamic seminary, has extended support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. However, the support, the seminary clarified, is only for the cleanliness campaign and not for Modi.
The move has come in response to a letter written by Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu to Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani, the Mohtamim (vice-chancellor) of Darul Uloom Deoband, soliciting the seminary’s support to the PM’s cleanliness campaign.
“I had received a letter from Naiduji. He had sought our support for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. We attribute cleanliness the top priority in Islam and there is no harm if anyone is advocating it. We support the effort. (But) we are not supporting Modi,” Nomani told The Indian Express.
Though Naidu had written to Nomani in September, the latter could reply just a few days back. Nomani said there was a vacation at the seminary owing to Bakrid and he had gone to his native place in Varanasi.
In his reply to Naidu’s letter, Nomani mentioned that Deoband appreciated the mission of the Union government, “supports it in full and congratulates Modi”. Nomani in his letter also mentioned that “lack of cleanliness had been a major issue of our country. As it is a social curse, it affects negatively the human and environment health. It is a pity that even after 67 years of freedom, we could not get rid of this evil. The campaign launched by the Prime Minister Modi is an appreciable step, though taken very late”.

It s time we stop over-dependence on FIIs: Deepak ParekhIt's time we stop over-dependence on 'fickle FIIs', says Deepak Parekh
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 17:16 IST
File picture of Deepak Parekh (Source: Reuters)
Raising concern about over-dependence of Indian capital markets on foreign institutional investors, eminent banker Deepak Parekh has said that something needs to be done to change this pattern.
"There is too much dependence on foreign institutional investors (FIIs), and I think we have exported our capital markets abroad. We have to do something to change this pattern," Parekh told a capital markets meet organised by the ISB here over the weekend.
"Who is really benefitting from our well regulated equity markets? It is not the Indians, it is not our institutions, it is not our labour, it is not our retirees, but the FIIs," said Parekh, Chairman of mortgage giant HDFC.
FIIs' stakes in the Sensex companies hit an all-time high of over 27 per cent in June this year. Their holdings in the wider BSE 200 Index reached an all-time high at 24.5 per cent, as per BofA-ML's Jyotivardhan Jaipuria.
Incidentally, HDFC as also group firm HDFC Bank are among companies with very high FII holdings.
The companies where FIIs have exhausted their permissible investment limits include Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, IDFC, IndusInd Bank, Lupin, Maruti and Titan among others. The sectors where there is still some room comprise banks, cement, auto and consumer goods.
"We all know how fickle FIIs are. They move in and out of the markets effortlessly and there is a herd instinct. History is replete with examples of how sudden reversals in capital flows can cause extensive damage and volatility to a country's financial system," Parekh warned.
A vocal proponent of free market, Parekh also crticised the government for using the divestment as a tool to "plug the fiscal deficit," and said state-run firms like LIC should not take holdings in other PSUs as part of divestment programme.
He also expressed displeasure at no progress being made on the front as yet, saying bunching up of issues towards the end of the fiscal reduces market's absorption capacity.
He also said the government has been "hanging on senselessly" with equity in many public sector companies such as BSNL and Air India as private companies have done very well in their sectors.
Alleging that investigating arms of the government like the CAG or CVC have "little understanding of valuations", Parekh also came out strongly over action taken against civil servants under whose leaderships such stake sales happen.
He further blamed the investment bankers and promoters for being greedy and commanding higher valuations in FY08, which saw a record initial public offerings and said that this behaviour has waned investor interest later.
"The cardinal rule is that one has to leave something on the table for investors, otherwise they will completely back out of such funding," he said, adding the number of issuances have been few even though we are in the midst of a bull-run in the market at present.

Court to hear final arguments in 2G case from Dec 19Special court to hear final arguments in 2G case from December 19
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 15:59 IST
The recording of evidence in the case involving former Telecom Minister A Raja and 16 others had started three years ago on November 11, 2011.
A Delhi court on Monday fixed December 19 for hearing final arguments in the 2G spectrum allocation scam case involving former Telecom Minister A Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and 15 others.
Special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Judge OP Saini, who was scheduled to hear the matter on Monday (November 10), deferred the case after counsel for CBI and the accused sought more time.
During the brief hearing, Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Anand Grover said that he required some more time to advance his arguments.
The SPP's submission came after Vijay Aggarwal, counsel for Swan Telecom promotor Shahid Balwa, one of the accused asked the court how it can commence final hearing when an application has been moved by CBI for examining more witnesses.
Earlier, on September 10, the court had concluded recording of defence evidence in the case. The CBI had alleged that there was a loss of Rs 30,984 crore to the exchequer in allocation of 122 licences for 2G spectrum which were scrapped by the Supreme Court on February 2, 2012.
The special judge, who is exclusively dealing with 2G scam cases , had concluded recording of defence evidence in the case in which the CBI had examined 153 witnesses while the accused called 29 witnesses in their defence.
The recording of evidence in the case involving Raja and 16 others had started three years ago on November 11, 2011, after the court had framed charges against the 17 accused named in the first two charge sheets filed by the agency.
The court has recorded statements of 153 CBI witnesses, including Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group Chairman Anil Ambani, his wife Tina Ambani and former corporate lobbyist Nira Radia, running into over 4,400 pages in the case.
Besides Raja and Kanimozhi, former Telecom Secretary Siddharth Behura, Raja's erstwhile private secretary RK Chandolia, Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka, Unitech MD Sanjay Chandra, three top executives of Reliance ADAG - Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair - are facing trial in the case.

State-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) and national helicopter company Pawan Hans will be listed on the stock exchanges to improve transparency and efficiency, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said on Monday.
The Minister also said that privatisation of national carrier Air India will not happen immediately, but cannot be ruled out in future and there have been suggestions from various quarters in this regard.
Proposals for listing of AAI and Pawan Hans have been made in the Draft Civil Aviation Policy, released by Raju in New Delhi.
Raju said that an expert committee will be constituted to develop the future roadmap for Air India.
"It is essential to ensure that the national carrier achieves its full potential," the Minister said, while adding that a Mission Mode project will also be set up to ensure that all organisations under the Ministry are competitive in terms of cost and efficiency.
"AAI will be corporatised followed by its listing on the stock exchanges to improve efficiency and transparency," Raju said, adding that listing of Pawan Hans would also be undertaken with the same objective.
AAI, a Miniratna Public Sector Enterprise, manages 125 airports across the country, including 11 International, 81 domestic and eight Customs Airports. It also manages 25 Civil Enclaves at Defence Airfields.
It has entered into Joint Ventures at Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Nagpur Airports to upgrade them.
AAI also provides Air Traffic Management Services over entire Indian Air Space and adjoining oceanic areas with ground installations at airports and other locations.
Pawan Hans was incorporated in 1985 and presently its shareholding comprises 51 per cent with the Government of India and 49 per cent with state-run ONGC .
It was incorporated with the primary objective of providing helicopter support services to the oil sector for its off-shore exploration operations, services in remote and hilly areas and charter services for promotion of tourism.
Over the years, it has grown into one of Asia's largest helicopter company and has a fleet of 47 helicopters.

Hundreds of grieving family members and friends of victims of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster are gathering in Amsterdam for a national commemoration ceremony nearly four months after the passenger jet was downed over eastern Ukraine killing all 298 people on board.
Family and friends of the victims were being joined by Dutch King Willem-Alexander, Prime Minister Mark Rutte and other dignitaries for Monday’s event in a conference center on the outskirts of the Dutch capital.
Speaking to broadcaster NOS ahead of the commemoration, Rutte said it will be “a chance for the Netherlands to show the next of kin that they are not standing alone.”
The Boeing 777 was downed July 17 while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.

Micromax Canvas 4+ review: Good performance  but the value proposition is not thatgreatPrint
Buy this if you are a Micromax fan.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:05 pm | Updated: November 25, 2014 11:09 am
For the past year or so Micromax has been giving Samsung tough competition in the Indian hinterland with value for money smartphones. From the time it launched the Canvas Knight earlier this year, this Indian company has been clearly nurturing dreams of offering high-end specs at mid-range price points. The latest in this range is the Micromax Canvas 4+.
Specs: 5-inch HD AMOLED display |  MediaTek MT6592 1.7GHz True Octa core processor with 1GB RAM | 16GB internal storage expandable up to 32GB | 13MP rear camera, 5MP front | 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 3.0 | Android 4.4.2 | 2000 mAh battery
Price: Rs 16,999
Design: Let’s just say this will remind you of the iPhone 3S once in a while. The phone as some bling factor thanks to the golden ring running around the bezel and golden flap on the back. The phone has a fixed back and the two SIMs and SD card go into flaps on the side. It is one of the lightest phones around, especially in this price bracket.
Display: The HD AMOLED display should be one of the selling points of this phone, but it isn’t. In the lock screen the display feels stubborn and need a good strong swipe to open. Inside, with dull colours like grey the pixels seems to show up and there is a matte finish like feel which is odd. The display is okay when the visuals are vibrant and colourful.
Performance: The octa-core processor makes this phone good for multi-tasking and some high-end gaming. There was no noticeable heating during the tests or even benchmarking. But don’t expect more than what you would from a mid range phone.
Software: Micromax still seems to believe in packing the phones with lots of software you might never use. This includes at least five Micromax apps and a few games. There is a camera widget that gives one touch access to features like selfie camera, dual shot using the front and back cameras as well as video. I also liked the simple lock screen that shows only clock.
Camera: This is among the few smartphones in this price range that gives you a 5MP front camera. This camera is good for selfies, though you will need to be in a well-lit area for the efforts to be successful. The rear camera is pretty decent too and has a totality that is rare in smartphone. The photos seem a bit underexposed, but in a good sort of way.
Storage: The phone has 16GB internal storage out of which roughly 11GB is available for users. The internal storage has a 2GB slot for system storage. You might want to buy a 16GB SD card with the phone.
Connectivity: No issues with connectivity, but we found that the FM radio seems to have antenna issues.
Battery: The battery will give you about 12 hours on a full charge. However, there seems to be apps that drain the battery quicker, like the FM radio.
Verdict: The Canvas 4+ has some good features that push the limits for the price range. But I doubt if it offers a great value proposition especially when there are other phones like the Lenovo Vibe X2 or Huawei Honor 6 offering much more at a slightly higher price tag. Buy this if you are a Micromax fan.

AAP slams Modi govt over Naddas appointment as healthministerManish Sisodia alleged that Nadda's appointment will lead to an increase in corruption and the cost of health facilities at AIIMS. (Source: Neeraj Priyadarshi)

The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday slammed the Narendra Modi government over the appointment of JP Nadda as the Union Health Minister as it claimed that he was responsible for the controversial removal recently of the Chief Vigilance Officer of AIIMS.
“JP Nadda, the man who got Sanjeev Chaturvedi transferred from AIIMS, made health min? So, now Modiji will remove corruption in AIIMS through Nadda?” AAP’s National Convener Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet.
AAP has been gunning for Nadda ever since Chaturvedi was removed from the post of the Chief Vigilance Officer at AIIMS in August. The party has alleged that Chaturvedi was ousted after Nadda put pressure on his predecessor in the health minister’s chair, Harsh Vardhan.
Nadda, a BJP national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP, was made the Union Health and Family Welfare Minister in the Cabinet reshuffle yesterday.
Senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia alleged that Nadda’s appointment will lead to an increase in corruption and the cost of health facilities at AIIMS.
“Nadda is the person who played an important in removing honest officials from the Health Ministry… If people like Nadda will sit in the Health Ministry, then it is obvious that medicines and health facilities will get costlier and there will be an increase in corruption,” charged Sisodia.
Chaturvedi was removed as the AIIMS CVO in a controversial manner with the then Health Minister Harsh Vardhan saying the step was taken because he did not fulfill the criteria for the appointment.

India is like home market for us now: Opera CEO LarsBoilesenPrint

Despite being one of the first web browsers that the world got used to Opera has been able to stay ahead of the game by implementing a mobile-first strategy that has now started showing dividends. With over 50 million of its 350 million plus users in India, the Norway-based software company claims to offer the cheapest access to Internet across the world. Opera Mini is now the third largest app in India after Facebook and Whatsapp. Excerpts from an interview with Opera Software CEO Lars Boilesen.
How important is India for you?
Just a few days ago we crossed 50 million monthly active users in India. It is clearly the biggest market for Opera Software. We can even say that this is our home market now. Half our users here are using Android and it shows how fast growing the market is… our goal is to reach 100 million. Only 20 per cent of the population here is connected and our vision since we came to India in 2006 has been to connect the unconnected.
Is the market similar to other geographies?
It is very similar to all other emerging markets, but growing much faster. These are all young, fast growing and mobile-first markets. People in these markets are getting connected for the first time through the mobile phone. And this just syncs with the Opera vision as we allow them to open a Facebook account even on a feature phone. We offer the same speeds for users across all device categories.
In India, is the growth happening on entry level phones?
Yes. We see a lot of growth happening on devices of Indian manufactures like Micromax, Karbonn and Lava. We have strategic partnerships with them and they are a big part of our success here. They pre-install Opera in many of their devices and that is a very efficient delivery model for us.
You said India is like your home market. But is that true in case of revenue also?
No. In terms of revenue India is not the largest. But I think we need to look at the future here. We want to invest in India and be here for 20 years later too. We want to invest in the future, in this great country’s potential. It is not like we don’t make money here. We reinvest all the money we make here and add a bit more. We have multiple revenue streams, but at the end of the day as CEO I want to reach out to all the Indians who are not connected. That is why we are an important part of Internet.org and have been compressing data for users for so many years.
Are you looking at different monetisation models for markets like India?
We have some good partners here continued…

A suicide bomber disguised in school uniform detonated explosives at a high school assembly in the northeast Nigerian city of Potiskum on Monday, killing at least 48 students, according to survivors and a morgue attendant.
Soldiers rushed to the scene, grisly with body parts, in the capital of Yobe state, but they were chased away with stones and calls by people angry at the military’s inability to halt a 5-year-old Islamic insurgency that has killed thousands and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes.
A suicide bomb attack in the same city killed 30 people one week ago, when suspected Boko Haram fighters attacked a religious procession of moderate Muslims.

Some 2,000 students had gathered for Monday morning’s weekly assembly at the Government Technical Science College when the explosion blasted through the school hall, according to survivors who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.
“We were waiting for the principal to address us, around 7:30 a.m., when we heard a deafening sound and I was blown off my feet, people started screaming and running, I saw blood all over my body,” 17-year-old student Musa Ibrahim Yahaya said from the general hospital, where he was being treated for head wounds.

As China dictates terms, MNCs forced to look for ways to avoid the squeeze

(When China joined the World…)
By Keith Bradsher
China is changing the rule book for business, forcing multinational companies to figure out how to play a new game or risk losing out on the world's second-largest economy.
When China joined the World Trade Organization 13 years ago, the government welcomed foreign companies, eager for their factories and technology. Now China is using its growing economic and financial muscle to dictate new terms, as dozens of American, European and Japanese businesses face scrutiny for corruption, monopolistic practices and, most recently, tax evasion.
With heads of state and corporate chieftains in Beijing for a major economic summit this week, China's increasing economic nationalism is expected to be heavily debated. The squeeze on multinationals has coincided with President Xi Jinping's consolidation of power and his increasingly nationalistic and sometimes confrontational stance toward China's neighbors and the West.
"If any leader wants to push for economic cooperation," said Li Cheng, the director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, "he's really taking a serious political risk."
While China has long presented unique challenges for businesses, the regulatory and legal environment has been especially perilous in recent months, with authorities pushing companies to cut prices and punishing them with large fines. GlaxoSmithKline, Volkswagen, Chrysler, Mead Johnson, Samsung, Johnson & Johnson and other companies have been hit with multimillion-dollar fines this year, while Microsoft, Daimler and Qualcomm are under investigation.
Then suddenly, in the last five weeks, there has been a lull in what had been a rapid pace of punishments. The pause has been all the more abrupt because Chinese officials were putting the finishing touches on what seemed likely to be their heaviest penalties yet in the continuing crackdown on monopolistic practices. The target was even identified by Chinese officials at a news conference in mid-September as Qualcomm, which invents and licenses mobile technology.
But Chinese regulators did not end up acting against Qualcomm, as Beijing's leaders were distracted by the protests in Hong Kong. China was then preoccupied with a top-level Communist Party meeting, followed by preparations for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in the coming days.
Another possible factor in the slower pace of investigations may be an important personnel change. Xu Kunlin, the head of the price supervision anti-monopoly division at the National Development and Reform Commission and the leading advocate of a tough stance toward multinationals, was transferred a month ago to run the separate price regulation division, said two people who know Xu but insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of personnel moves.
Xu's transfer came right after foreign businesses and governments had complained bitterly to senior Chinese officials about the anti-monopoly investigations. While his transfer has most likely delayed some antitrust investigations, it is not necessarily a demotion, and the timing with the foreign complaints may be a coincidence, said the two people. The price regulation division has just had a corruption scandal, and Xu has now been given broad authority to rebuild it.
While national and provincial investigators appear to have pressed pause, township governments have quietly stepped up their activities, raiding the local offices of multinationals.
The townships, which do not have the legal authority to enforce antitrust legislation, are operating under old, vaguely worded laws against price gouging as well as collusion that are still on the books even as China has modernized much of its legal code to embrace more market-oriented principles. The local investigators have been copying large amounts of memos, tax records and financial documents. The more complex documents have then been forwarded to more experienced investigators in provincial capitals.
"We have clients that are investigated by very, very rudimentary teams who have no clue what they are doing," said an adviser to multinationals who insisted on anonymity because of the legal sensitivity of the cases. Those teams, the adviser said, nonetheless manage to accumulate large quantities of confidential corporate data, sending a shudder through the head offices of the affected multinationals.
  Whether the Chinese government is focusing disproportionately on foreign companies is the subject of considerable dispute.
Foreign business groups calculate that half the recent national and provincial antitrust and collusion penalties have been aimed at multinationals even though they represent a very small share of the Chinese economy. But Chinese officials said in late September that if all collusion penalties assessed by local governments are included, then multinationals are only the targets a tenth of the time.

Company Expansion
(A new facility for large…)
TOKYO/NEW DELHI: Japanese firm Toshiba Corporation will invest about $ 30 million for expanding its production capacity in the power transmission and distribution business in India.
The investment is part of the company's plan to invest $ 100 million in Indian power sector by 2016.
"Toshiba Corporation will reinforce its transmission and distribution (T&D) business in India with a 3 billion yen (approximately $ 30 million) investment in new production capacity at Toshiba Transmission & Distribution Systems India Private Ltd (TTDI) in Hyderabad," the company said in a statement.
"India is a high-growth market that Toshiba has positioned as a strategic base for its power-related businesses.
"In the period to FY16, Toshiba plans to invest a cumulative 10-billion yen (approximately $ 100 million) in its T&D business there, including this current round of investment," said Katsutoshi Toda, CMD, TTDI.
"Toshiba is seeking to secure a 20 per cent share of the Indian market by 2018, and also reinforce TTDI as a core T&D production base for other major markets, including Europe, ASEAN, and Africa," Toda said.
A new facility for large power transformers will come on line in 2015 at Hyderabad at the same time as the full scale launch of a new unit for switchgears.
Alongside its existing production line of small and medium capacity transformers and low and medium voltage switchgears, the new power transformer line will support production of 765 kV (kilovolt) transformers with a capacity of 500 MVA (mega volt ampere), while the new switchgear line will produce high voltage products.
Toshiba established TTDI in 2013 by acquiring T&D business from Vijai Electricals for 20 billion yen or approximately $ 200 million, and also started operation of a new power transformer facility in Russia in February 2014.

IS leader wounded in airstrike

AP Video grab of leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. File photo.
TOPICS
Iraqi officials said on Sunday that an airstrike wounded the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such a strike or al-Baghdadi being wounded.
Iraq’s Defence and Interior Ministries issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without elaborating.
An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was hit during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim in Iraq’s western Anbar province.
The official, citing informants within the militant group, said the strike wounded al-Baghdadi. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.
Both officials said the operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces. Neither knew the extent of al-Baghdadi’s apparent injuries. State television later also reported that al—Baghdadi had been wounded.
Al-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a USD 10 million US bounty on his head.
Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaeda into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community.
The reclusive leader is purported to have made only one public appearance, delivering a sermon at a mosque in Iraq’s second-largest city of Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June.
Al-Baghdadi’s purported appearance in Mosul came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.
Since then, part of the Islamic State group’s core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as a ruler and not just a fighting force.
In parts of Syria under its control, the group now administers courts, fixes roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology.
A US-led coalition has been launching airstrikes on Islamic State militants and facilities in Iraq and Syria for months as part of an effort to give Iraqi forces the time and space to mount a more effective offensive.

Maharashtra assembly session begins  Sena MLAs sit in OppnShiv Sena sits in opposition in Maharashtra
Dharmendra Jore , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, November 10, 2014
First Published: 12:27 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:27 IST(11/11/2014)
As the new Maharashtra assembly held its first sitting on Monday, the Shiv Sena staked claim to the post of leader of the opposition even as it continued to negotiate with the BJP on joining the government.
 
The BJP confirmed talks were on but reiterated that the Sena should accept what was offered and stop demanding a certain number of ministerial berths or portfolios.

Undermining the seriousness of the legislature’s procedures in its bid to pressure the BJP, the Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for leader of the Opposition. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray justified it saying he sent the letter to the legislature secretary because the Congress was rushing to grab the post.
“The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn’t work? Then we won’t get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader),” Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening. If the talks with BJP fail the Sena would perform the role of a strong opposition party, he added.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands —10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister — to vote in favour of the trust vote on November 12. The BJP is 23 votes short of a majority.
The two parties split just before the assembly elections after 25 years together. Now, both have taken strong positions on power-sharing, but are still talking. A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis himself would prefer to go with `natural ally’ Sena, but wants Thackeray to make `reasonable’ demands since the BJP already has 121 seats.
The Sena leadership, while slowly reconciling itself to sitting in the opposition, is wary the BJP could poach some of its 63 MLAs. It is also worried it could lose control of the Mumbai civic body, where it is in alliance with the BJP.
On Sunday, Thackeray asked Anil Desai, the Sena’s Rajya Sabha member who was to join Narendra Modi’s ministry, to boycott the swearing in. Later, he asked the BJP to clarify its stand on seeking the NCP’s support from outside.
On Monday, the Sena staked claim to the post of leader of the opposition a couple of hours after NCP chief Sharad Pawar reiterated his resolve to support the BJP from outside and ridiculed Thackeray for making remarks against him a day before.   
Armed with a plan B for winning the trust vote – support from the NCP and 14 to 17 MLAs from small parties and Independents -- the BJP was still hopeful of patching up with the Sena. It prefers the Sena because of their common ideology and experience of working together. The BJP was unwilling to go with NCP because of the party’s tainted track record.
The BJP can expect find the going tough if it leans on the NCP. Pawar gave it a veiled warning on Monday when he said that the BJP should reopen and inquire into all the cases (of corruption and irregularities) against his leaders. 
A confident Fadnavis, who said earlier his mandate (from the party high command) was to govern and not to save the government, put on a brave face by telling party colleagues that he would sail through in any case.
When asked, Fadnavis refused to comment on the matter.
A senior BJP leader told HT that the doors were kept open for the Sena even after the day’s development. “Talks with the Sena are on through several channels. We are still hopeful of the Sena withdrawing the claim [to the post of leader of the opposition] if we strike a suitable deal.”

(AFP Photo)
Iraqi military forces have reached the centre of the northern city of Baiji in an effort to break an Islamic State siege of the country's biggest refinery, triggering fierce clashes with the militants, according to an army colonel and a witness.
Separately, contradictory reports emerged over the fate of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL) after US-led air strikes against the group in at least two locations in Iraq on Friday night.
The United States said it had no information to indicate Baghdadi had been hit, but a report on Iraqi state television said he had been wounded.
Baghdadi's fighters seized much of northern Iraq five months ago in a lightning offensive which also saw them capture the city of Baiji and surround its oil refinery, halting production there and besieging a detachment of government troops there.
The colonel said Iraqi troops entered Baiji, a city of about 200,000 people, from the south and west and took over the al-Tamim neighbourhood and city centre.
Islamic State had placed bombs along roads in Baiji and deployed snipers to keep government forces from advancing, tactics used in other cities held by the ultra-hardline Sunni group, which controls swathes of both Iraq and Syria.
"There are IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and snipers that are slowing down the advance, but the presence of the air force has facilitated the process of dismantling the IEDs in order to push forward," said the colonel.
"The areas taken so far are 6 km (4 miles) away from Baiji's refinery," he added. He said 12 militants had been killed. Baiji resident Sultan al-Janabi told Reuters by telephone from his house that clashes had been raging since the advance, the first time security forces reached the city centre since launching a new encirclement strategy at the end of last month.
"Violent confrontations are taking place in Baiji right now. I've been hearing continuous fire and loud bangs," said Janabi.
Baghdadi's fate unclear
US officials said on Sunday they had no information to indicate Islamic State commander Baghdadi had been wounded in air strike near the Iraqi city of Mosul, or if he was even in the convoy that was hit on Friday night.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, were asked about an account on Twitter that said Baghdadi had been wounded.
One official said that "nothing has changed" since Saturday, when the US military said it was unclear if Baghdadi was present at the time of the strikes which targeted 10 vehicles.

A Twitter account claimed Baghdadi had been wounded but other accounts that support Islamic State said the report was untrue.
A member of western Anbar Province's security committee said he had heard unconfirmed reports that Baghdadi had been wounded and moved to Syria.
Iraqi officials and witnesses said there had been an air strike in Anbar, and Islamic State had cleared a hospital so that leaders of the group who had gathered for a meeting which was attacked could be treated for injuries.
Several other Anbar officials gave contradictory reports on Baghdadi's fate. State television cited reports that Baghdadi had been wounded. It gave no further details.
Even if Baghdadi were killed, Iraq would still face the challenge of defeating a group which quickly defeated its military in the north in June and is determined to expand a self-proclaimed caliphate.
The United States, which fought Islamic State's predecessor al Qaeda during the American occupation of Iraq, will send up to 1,500 more troops to train Iraqi forces. Britain also plans to send trainers.
US air strikes, launched after Islamic State beheaded Western hostages, have slowed down the Sunni insurgents and enabled Iraqi security forces to make some gains.

Police general killed
On Friday night, a suicide bomber rammed a truck packed with explosives into a Humvee transporting senior police commander General Faisal Malik, one of the supervisors of the campaign against Islamic State militants surrounding the refinery. The general and two policemen were killed.
The truck used in the attack was armoured, the army colonel and a provincial police command centre said, suggesting Islamic State had seized it from defeated Iraqi troops. Tanks and anti-aircraft weapons have also been taken.
The army colonel estimated that Iraqi forces had taken about 40 percent of the city centre. That could not be independently confirmed.
Iraqi security forces have used helicopters to attack Islamic State insurgents surrounding the refinery. But months of operations have failed to rescue comrades trapped inside and ensure the strategic site will not fall into the hands of Islamic State, who have used oil and fuel to fund their self-proclaimed caliphate.
Iraqi oil industry officials estimate Islamic State is making multi-million dollar profits from the illegal trade. Government forces, including counter-terrorism units, inside the compound have been surviving on airdrops as military forces outside tried to drive Islamic State militants away.
The Baiji refinery was producing around 175,000 barrels per day before it was closed, a senior Iraqi official said in June. Iraq's domestic daily consumption is estimated at 600,000-700,000 bpd.

DDA draw now likely to be held on November 12The fate of more than 10 lakh people — who have applied for the Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) housing scheme 2014 — is likely to be decided on Wednesday, November 12.
Unlike previous years, residents this time can watch DDA’s draw of lots live on YouTube.
DDA’s housing scheme, with 25,034 flats on offer, was launched on September 1 and closed on October 15 after an extension. The draw of lots for the scheme was scheduled to be held on November 5 initially, but following delays in the processing of all the applications, it was postponed to November 10.
However, DDA officials are now sceptical of even being able to meet the new deadline.
“We will hold a trial run of the draw of lots on November 11 and if everything goes well, the draw will be held on November 12,” said DDA vice-chairman Balvinder Kumar. “All the data of the applications have come to us only recently. We are waiting to see if any applications are left or if there are applications that came in after corrections,” he said.
The systems department of DDA will carry out a mock draw on November 11 to see if the software is working perfectly. “That way, we will ensure there are no technical snags at the time of the actual draw,” said a senior DDA official.
Since the number of applications is huge, DDA will be assisted by C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) in carrying out the draw, which will be held at the development authority’s Vikas Sadan headquarters.
“We will hold the draw at Vikas Sadan and servers have already been brought here for the purpose,” Kumar said.
Although the housing scheme draw is a closed door affair, people will be able to watch the process live on YouTube as DDA has decided to webcast the draw this year.

AAI  Pawan Hans to be Listed: Civil Aviation MinisterGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
State-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) and national helicopter company Pawan Hans will be listed on the stock exchanges to improve transparency and efficiency, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said today.
The civil aviation minister also said that privatisation of national carrier Air India will not happen immediately, but cannot be ruled out in future and there have been suggestions from various quarters in this regard.
Proposals for listing of AAI and Pawan Hans have been made in the Draft Civil Aviation Policy, which was released by the minister.
Mr Raju said that an expert committee will be constituted to develop the future roadmap for Air India.
"It is essential to ensure that the national carrier achieves its full potential," the minister said, while adding that a Mission Mode project will also be set up to ensure that all organisations under the ministry are competitive in terms of cost and efficiency.
"AAI will be corporatised followed by its listing on the stock exchanges to improve efficiency and transparency," Mr Raju said, adding that listing of Pawan Hans would also be undertaken with the same objective.
AAI, a Miniratna Public Sector Enterprise, manages 125 airports across the country, including 11 international, 81 domestic and eight customs airports. It also manages 25 Civil Enclaves at Defence Airfields.
It has entered into joint ventures at Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Nagpur Airports to upgrade them. AAI also provides Air Traffic Management Services over entire Indian Air Space and adjoining oceanic areas with ground installations at airports and other locations. Pawan Hans was incorporated in 1985 and presently its shareholding comprises 51 per cent with the Government of India and 49 per cent with state-run ONGC.
It was incorporated with the primary objective of providing helicopter support services to the oil sector for its off-shore exploration operations, services in remote and hilly areas and charter services for promotion of tourism.
Over the years, it has grown into one of Asia's largest helicopter company and has a fleet of 47 helicopters.

Dollar lower  franc within sight of SNB ceiling vs euroDollar surges on strong U.S. jobs data, more room to rise
By Daniel Bases, Reuters
Finance Federal Reserve Mario Draghi Stanley Fischer European Central Bank
The U.S. dollar reached fresh multiyear highs on Friday after a stronger-than-forecast November U.S. jobs report increased expectations the Federal Reserve may begin raising interest rates sooner than previously thought.
Employers added the most workers in nearly three years in November and wages rose, the latest U.S. employment report showed. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 321,000, better than forecasts for an increase of 230,000. The unemployment rate held steady at a six-year low of 5.8 percent.

Earlier this week U.S. central bank officials such as New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer made comments that pointed toward rate increases in response to stronger U.S. economic figures, maintaining a focus on what the data showed.
"The Fed already indicated that they were shifting. The comments from Dudley and Fischer earlier this week suggested they were beginning to think seriously about normalizing (policy) and this would make them think even more seriously, that they should be thinking about H1 (first half of the year) versus H2," said Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX.
0
Friday's jobs data pulled market expectations for the Fed to start tightening monetary policy back toward mid-2015 from September.
Interest rate futures contracts now show that traders see about a 53 percent chance for a July 2015 hike, based on the CME FedWatch program. That is more in line with last month's Reuters poll of economists who see the first rate increase in June of next year.
"The trend is pretty good. Now comes the second-guessing in the market. It brings concerns that the Fed might look to raise earlier than some people had expected. I don't think anyone should fear the Fed right now," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. Brown said the increase could be seasonal but there is optimism heading into 2015.
Rising U.S. interest rates would be in stark contrast to the euro zone and Japan, where monetary policy is moving in the opposite direction. The pattern would increase the yield advantage for investors holding U.S. dollar-denominated assets.
"We think dollar/yen could hit 125 yen before the end of 2014. But then it is going to stabilize. We think that the good news will be priced in at that stage," said Englander, who added the euro has more to fall, perhaps reaching $1.20 before the end of the year and plumbing lows of $1.12 to $1.15 in 2015.
In late afternoon New York trade, the dollar traded at 121.42 yen, a gain of 1.37 percent but off a high of 121.68 yen, the strongest level since mid-2007.
The euro fell 0.70 percent to $1.2290. In the immediate trading after the payrolls data the euro slid to $1.2271, its weakest since mid-August 2012.
On Thursday, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the central bank would decide early next year whether to take fresh action to revive the economy. Draghi also said any decision by the bank's Governing Council need not be unanimous to begin quantitative easing measures, including buying of sovereign bonds in an effort to spur borrowing and investment.
Some in the market were disappointed Draghi did not find an even more explicit way of moving the bank closer to outright quantitative easing.
But his language, and a veiled warning that opposition from German policymakers would not stand in the way of the governing council acting if need be, pointed towards the launch of bond-buying in the first quarter.
"Taking on board likely further falls in headline HICP (inflation), Draghi's comments give succour to the idea that further policy moves are coming at the next couple of meetings," said London-based Gavin Friend, senior markets strategist at National Australia Bank.
The U.S. dollar index hit a peak of 89.467 <.DXY>, its highest since early March 2009, up 0.86 percent on the day.
The slide in crude oil prices to below $66 a barrel  continued to undermine the Norwegian crown. At one point the dollar advanced 1.75 percent to 7.1793 crowns , its strongest since March 2009. It traded late at 7.1263 crowns, for a 1 percent gain on the day.

Prasad to meet top officials from Amazon  FlipkartPrasad to meet top officials from Amazon, Flipkart

New Delhi, Nov 10:  
In a bid to reinvigorate the postal department by linking it with the booming e-commerce industry, IT and Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is scheduled to meet the heads of Amazon India and Flipkart this week.
Amazon India Vice-President and Country Manager Amit Agarwal and Monique Meche, Vice-President of Global Public Policy at Amazon, are scheduled to meet Prasad tomorrow.
Flipkart co-founder and CEO Sachin Bansal is also expected to meet the minister on November 13, sources said.
They said the agenda of the meeting is to discuss ways in which India Post, the world’s largest postal network, can be utilised by e-commerce players to deliver goods across the country.
Prasad, they said, is of the view that with its unparalleled rural reach, India Post would be best suited to offer delivery services to e-commerce players.
The Government is also looking at using e-commerce to improve the efficiency of postmen, and contemplating ways to incentivise them for timely delivery of goods.
“The postmen are expected to get some reward for timely delivery of products, although it’s just an idea as of now,” said a source.
India Post has over 1.55 lakh post offices, of which more than 1.39 lakh are in the rural areas. On an average, a post office serves an area of 21.21 sq km and a population of 7,175 people.
According to market analysts, the last-mile delivery of products ordered by online shoppers will figure as one of the major deciding factors for e-commerce firms such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, and so on.
These firms offer one-day delivery to their clients and the demand is expected to further intensify as they are investing in logistics to ramp up their delivery system.
The opportunity in back-end logistics for the online shopping segment is estimated at Rs 3,500-4,000 crore, a major part of which is last mile delivery.
According to a joint study by consultancy firm PwC and industry body Assocham, the size of the e-retail industry is poised to touch $10-20 billion by 2017-2020 and e-commerce firms are expected to spend up to $1.9 billion by 2017-2020 on infrastructure, logistics and warehousing.

China deal sends global shares to 1-month highChina deal sends global shares to 1-month high
Reuters
Tweet
London, Nov 10:  
A landmark deal to give global investors easier access to China’s $3.9 trillion stock market lifted world shares to their highest in over a month on Monday, as tensions in Libya and Ukraine pushed up oil prices.
Chinese shares jumped 2.5 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbed almost 1 per cent after the two exchanges announced a November 17 start date for their long-awaited tie-up.
European shares
European markets also got off to positive start amid more M&A activity and encouraging results from brewer Carlsberg, pushing the 45-country MSCI All World index, to its highest since late September.
In the currency market, the dollar made a poor start to the week, with some traders still using mixed US jobs numbers on Friday to lock in recent gains. The Swiss franc was also in focus as it nudged the Swiss National Bank’s 1.20 ceiling against the under-pressure euro.
“The dollar has had a good run of late and those who have been short euro dollar for example have just taken this chance (to take stock),’’ said Geoffrey Yu, a strategist with UBS in London.
Bond markets
Europe’s bond markets were feeling the benefit of Friday’s rally in US government bonds after the jobs data.
Even Spanish bond yields dipped despite millions of Catalans voting over the week-end in a non-legally binding referendum on independence from the rest of Spain.
The dollar’s fall also lifted the battered gold price from 4 1/2-year lows. Gold traded at $1,172.50 per ounce, above Friday’s low of $1,131.85 though the rebound in the yen against the dollar pushed down Japanese stocks on the Nikkei.
Crude oil
Oil prices rose on renewed political tensions in West Asia and Ukraine, with Brent crude gaining 0.6 per cent, extending its recovery from a four-year low hit last Wednesday.
Fierce fighting between Iraqi military forces and Islamic State insurgents, the third Libyan oil field closure in a week and shelling in the pro-Russian stronghold of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine were all factors in the move.
Rouble surges
There was no sign that recent volatility in Russia’s rouble was about to let up as, after dabbling with the idea last week, Russia’s central bank formally abolished structured currency market interventions. Shortly before the announcement, President Vladimir Putin had said there were no reasons for the slide in the Russian currency.
After a dramatic fall in the previous week and volatile swings of 6 per cent in its rate on Friday, the rouble was last up almost 3 per cent at 45.32 to the dollar.

Sensex  Nifty end flat on profit bookingMarket update: Sensex, Nifty end flat on profit booking after logging record highs in early trade
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 18:20 IST

After hitting a new record high of 28,027.96 points in early trade as investors cheered Cabinet expansion, the benchmark Sensex on Monday ended just 6 points higher compared to the previous close as investors booked profit across counters.
After opening on a strong footing, the 30-share BSE Sensex surged to hit new lifetime high of 28,027.96, breaching its previous high of 28,010.39 recorded on November 5.
The index soon started losing momentum quickly and briefly slipped into the negative territory in volatile trade to touch a low of 27,764.75.
It finally ended 6.10 points higher at 27,874.73.
ITC, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's, Hind Unilever, Coal India , Bajaj Auto, BHEL, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Wipro led the 15 Sensex gainers, while Tata Motors, Tata Steel, TCS, SBI, Sesa Sterlite, RIL, M&M, L&T, ICICI Bank and ONGC were among the 15 losers.
The 50-share NSE Nifty after hitting a new peak of 8,383.05 in early trade, also succumbed to profit-booking. It gave up most of initial gains to touch a low of 8,304.45 before ending at 8,344.25, showing a moderate rise of 7.25 points. The gauge had previous intra-day record high of 8,365.55, touched on November 5.
Market players said sentiment was upbeat on hopes that the government will accelerate economic reforms process after expansion of the Union Cabinet , lifting the Sensex and Nifty to new highs.
Some investors sitting on gains, however, became cautious and booked profits in recent outperformers, dragging down the key indices from record highs, they added.
Sectorally, the BSE FMCG index gained the most by rising 2.81 per cent, followed by consumer durables index 1.00 per cent, power index 0.84 per cent and healthcare index 0.47 per cent.
However, oil & gas index ended in the negative zone with a fall of 1.29 per cent, capital goods index (down 1.01 per cent), banking index (down 0.53 per cent), PSU index (down 0.48 per cent) and auto index (down 0.34 per cent).
A mixed closing at the other Asian markets and a slightly higher opening on the European markets influenced the sentiment, market players said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 2,537.13 crore on Friday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.

India may sign WTO s Trade Facilitation Agreement: Study paperNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
India may finally sign the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement following discussions with the US on the details of an indefinite “peace clause” on food security, according to a research paper discussing the effectiveness of the upcoming G20 summit.
The study paper by Melbourne-based think-tank Australia India Institute (AII) titled ‘The G20: Challenges and opportunities Ahead’, said following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US and his talks with US President Barack Obama, India may finally sign the agreement.
“As a part of a revised proposal, India and the US are reported to be discussing the details of an indefinite peace clause on food security until a permanent solution is found,” it said ahead of the G20 summit in Brisbane starting November 16. Prime Minister Modi is also attending the summit.
“A peace clause would give legal security to member countries and protect them from challenges under other WTO agreements,” the paper said.
It cited that the G20, with its Doha Lite package, ensured the success of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Bali Ministerial Meeting.
“Though the legal texts and technical parameters including rules are still to be finalised, the meeting succeeded in addressing the core concerns of emerging and developing countries on maintaining public stockpiles of food grains for sale to poorer citizens at subsidised prices beyond permissible subsidy limits, in anticipation of a permanent solution,” it said.
“Some obstacles remain. India is trying to stall implementation of the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), agreed to in Bali and has tied ratification of the agreement to a permanent solution to the contentious issue of public stockpiling of food grains,” it added.
The paper also highlighted that the G20 in Brisbane this month would be dominated by the issues of financial sector regulation, trade facilitation measures, protectionism, infrastructure investment and tax policy coordination.
“The G20, as a genuine summit of national leaders, can credibly implement meaningful measures. What is, however, desirable is a more focussed approach to increased economic growth across member nations, especially after the US financial crisis,” it said.
It also sought for strengthening the G20 and that it should be upgraded from a forum to an institution, in a bid to make implementating difficult measures such as structural reform easier and more effective.

Why did the judge announce his religious inclinationsBy Will Baude November 7
Today the Seventh Circuit decided a case about Northwestern University’s decision to cease dealings with a campus rabbi after several underage drinking incidents. The opinion is by Judge Posner, so it is short, interesting, and starts with links to extraneous material on Wikipedia and Youtube. (Thanks to Chaim Saiman for the link.)
It also contains a strange concurrence by Judge Bauer, which reads in its entirety:
I cheerfully concur in this enlightening opinion. The background and various nuances of the religious groups discussed, or alluded to, are not taken from the record of the case but are both enlightening and, I confess, entertaining. Since the result meets my legal and religious inclinations, I have no reason not to endorse the dissertation and ruling and therefore I do.
This is not the first time Judge Bauer has written such a concurrence. Consider this one (pointed out to me on Twitter by Joel Flaxman):
I join the opinion insofar as it affirms the grant of summary judgment to the defendants. But as Judge Posner points out, many lawyers decided against medical school because of lack of interest in the clinical aspects of medicine or a deeper interest in the less scientific aspects of law. I was one of those who chose law as opposed to medicine.
I think the opinion made the necessary legal point when it said that the record shows that summary judgment was clearly the right decision. That’s where I would stop.
So I get the general idea that the more recent concurrence is meant to contrast with the previous one, with Judge Bauer explaining why this time he’s okay with a tangential discussion in a Posner opinion when he wasn’t before. But I still can’t figure out exactly what Judge Bauer means by saying “the result meets my legal and religious inclinations.” Nor am I really sure why those religious inclinations — as distinct from his legal inclinations — ought to decide whether he joins an opinion in full.
Suggestions welcome.
Will Baude is an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School, where he teaches constitutional law and federal courts. His recent articles include Rethinking the Federal Eminent Domain Power, (Yale Law Journal, 2013), and Beyond DOMA: State Choice of Law in Federal Statutes, (Stanford Law Review, 2012).

Jet-Etihad deal gets Singapore competition watchdog clearanceair transport
Clearing last of its regulatory hurdles, Jet Airways’ commercial alliance with Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, including a Rs 2,060-crore stake sale, has received approval from the Competition Commission of Singapore.
While giving its long-pending clearance, Singapore’s fair trade watchdog has ruled that the alliance “by its nature” has potential to adversely impact competition in the country, but “on the balance” the efficiencies from the deal outweighs the anti-competitive effect.
Over a year after the deal being announced in April 2013, the Singapore regulator announced in June this year that it has launched a public scrutiny of Jet-Etihad alliance to probe any possible violation of competition laws in the country.
The deal, which involved purchase of a 24 per cent stake in Naresh Goyal-led Jet for about Rs 2,060 crore by Etihad along with other tie-ups, went through turbulent times for months after being announced.
The deal finally got consummated late last year after clearance by various Indian regulators including fair trade watchdog CCI (Competition Commission of India) and capital markets regulator SEBI.
However, the deal came under scanner of the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS), as the alliance “relates to the provision of international air passenger transport services (and associated support services), with a specific focus on the Singapore origin and destination city pairs”.
After a public scrutiny and pursuant to submissions made by various stakeholders on filings made by the two carriers, CCS has now given its go-ahead to the deal.
Incidentally, the CCS approval comes at a time when Jet Airways has reported a quarterly net profit on stand-alone basis for the first time since 2012, helped by a one-time income from sale of its loyalty programme to Etihad.
On consolidated basis also, Jet has managed to narrow its losses by about 96 per cent to Rs 43 crore in the quarter ended September 30, as against a whopping net loss of Rs 999 crore in the year-ago period.
Announcing its clearance, CCS said the alliance involves Jet and Etihad cooperating on route and schedule coordination, pricing, distribution and marketing, among other things.
CCS said that it examined the alliance in view of the markets for provision of international scheduled air passenger services and air freight services on the affected Singapore origin and destination city pairs.
“After reviewing submissions provided by the Parties and various stakeholders, CCS finds that the Proposed Commercial Alliance will, by its nature, have the object of preventing, restricting or distorting competition within Singapore.”
“However, given that the Proposed Commercial Alliance has minimal adverse impact on competition in the Relevant Markets, CCS is satisfied that, on the balance, the efficiencies accrued from the Proposed Commercial Alliance outweighs the anti-competitive effect of the Proposed Commercial Alliance and therefore the Proposed Commercial Alliance is excluded from section 34 of the Act,” it said in its 28-page order.
Under Singapore competition laws, “an agreement will fall within the scope of Section 34 prohibition if it has as its object or effect the appreciable prevention, restriction or distortion of competition.”
The decision to clear the deal was conveyed to Jet and Etihad on October 16, but it has been made public now after removing confidential information about the alliance.
Justifying its clearance, CCS said benefits that outweigh anti-competitive effect of this deal include “economic efficiencies achieved through joint operations and sharing of resources, as well as an expansion of Jet’s existing network which will enable it to compete in the market segment of intercontinental travel and Europe-Singapore travel.”
CCS is a statutory body in Singapore and it is mandated to investigate alleged anti-competitive activities, determine if such activities infringe the Act and impose suitable remedies, directions and financial penalties.
Abu Dhabi-based Etihad is the national airline of the United Arab Emirates and it operates to over 85 passenger and cargo destinations in over 50 countries. Jet is a leading airline in India, operating to over 50 domestic and 20 international destinations.
Jet has initiated a major restructuring including significant cost—cutting measures to attain profitability, while it has also begun tapping synergies from Etihad deal.
Struggling under high expenses and adverse operating conditions, Jet had posted its highest—ever annual loss of Rs 4,129 crore in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014.
Forced to take tough measures, Jet has adopted a three—year business plan, which includes cleaning up of balance sheet, pruning of over—valued assets, cost restructuring and changes in service and fleet plans.
These decisions, as also the appointment of Australian national Cramer Ball as new CEO of Jet, were taken at a board meeting on May 27, which was attended for the first time by representatives of Etihad Airways.
Etihad’s investments in Jet, totalling USD 750 million, comprises Rs 2,057.66 crore (USD 380 million) for a 24 per cent stake in the company, USD 70 million towards purchase of three slots at London Heathrow airport, USD 150 million to secure a 50.1 per cent stake in the JetPrivilege Frequent Flyer Programme and USD 150 million through HSBC.
Etihad has come in as “a long—term strategic investor and committed to supporting Jet as it re—engineers its business to achieve sustainable profitability.”
After months of scrutiny, Indian capital markets regulator SEBI had also ruled in May this year that Etihad does not have to make an open offer for Jet shareholders pursuant to the Rs 2,060 crore deal.
SEBI’s long-running probe had centred on the contention whether Etihad was getting control despite purchasing only 24 per cent stake. After looking into various aspects, Sebi finally ruled that Etihad “has not acquired control over Jet“.
The deal was incidentally restructured last year to address various “control” related and other concerns raised by SEBI and the CCI.

The rise of Prabhu: PMs sherpa with Cabinet rank to sherpa in CabinetPrint
Suresh Prabhu.
Written by P Vaidyanathan Iyer | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:24 am | Updated: November 10, 2014 4:07 pm
Three days ago, in his first media interaction as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s sherpa for the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Brisbane on November 15-16, Suresh Prabhu said in a lighter vein that the question of him joining the Council of Ministers could be included in the G20 agenda if the media so desired. Prabhu, 61, a chartered accountant, said this with a wry smile, masking whatever information he had of the weekend’s Cabinet expansion.
Prabhu, who has got Railways, is not just another addition to Modi’s Council of Ministers. Given his intellectual bandwidth, a non-political persona, and the trust reposed by the Prime Minister, he brings more than his weight in the government.
Having decided to severe ties with the Shiv Sena, Modi could not have got the Sena to part with a Rajya Sabha seat for Prabhu. The Prime Minister also felt that attaching ministerial strings would rob Prabhu of his flexibility to advise him on a variety of critical issues, from energy and climate change to physical infrastructure and the economy.
Finally though, Modi decided to add depth and weight to his team by roping in Prabhu and Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar. Prabhu, who had once said in an interview that he would rather quit politics than change parties, was convinced by Modi to join the BJP. After 18 years with the Sena, he formally joined the BJP on Sunday, ahead of the swearing-in ceremony.
A person close to Prabhu said Modi trusted him and the former banker — Prabhu was chairman of Saraswat Bank, one of the largest cooperative banks in Maharashtra — would be his sounding board on complex issues related to energy, infrastructure and climate change.
The Modi government had earlier appointed him as the head of an advisory group for integrated development of power, coal and renewable energy. Subsequently, Prabhu was made the sherpa to brief and assist the PM on India’s stand on global issues at the G20 summit, and given Cabinet rank. He was also tipped to head the “think-tank plus” — the Planning Commission in its new avatar.
Prabhu has been close to Modi since the days when the latter was the Gujarat Chief Minister. In fact, after the Wharton India Economic Forum, a student-run India-centric conference hosted by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, withdrew its invitation to Modi as a keynote speaker in 2013, Prabhu cancelled his speaking programme as a mark of protest. That showed his proximity to Modi.
Prabhu’s biggest strength, as also his drawback in a party like Shiv Sena, was his clean image and unwillingness to shed his integrity at the altar of politics. In August 2002, Sena chief Bal Thackeray pulled him out of then Prime Minister A B Vajpayee’s Cabinet without stating any reasons. Prabhu was then the Union Power Minister.
Prabhu won the Lok Sabha elections thrice since 1996, but lost in 2009.

Giriraj s inclusion  crisp slap  to secularism: CongCongress today took potshots at Narendra Modi’s ministry expansion saying the inclusion of BJP leader Giriraj Singh was a “crisp slap” by the Prime Minister to secularism.
The party said that the expansion was “far more” of caste, geography and less on merit.
Singh’s inclusion in the government is a “crisp slap by Modi to secularism and inclusion”, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.
Priyanka Chaturvedi, a Congress leader and panelist tweeted, “Am certain the way things are going Giriraj Singh will take charge as MoS MEA, to facilitate all Modi haters to move to Pakistan. Strategic.”
Singh had earlier this year made a controversial statement that those opposing Modi should go to Pakistan for which he was also pulled up by the party leadership.
Congress General Secretary and in-charge of party’s Communication Department, Ajay Maken tweeted,”Took 6 MONTHS for Full Time Defense/Security, Power, Rural Development, Surface Transport, Environment #ModiKeMantri OR Wait Who knows even now?”
Referring to the Supreme Court’s order that the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers should desist from appointing tainted people as ministers, Maken tweeted, “27 Aug SC Decision-Expected 13 Tainted Min removal But New Tainted Min added- Affidavit shows 23 cases. Modi Ji What about #SwachhPolitics?”

Govt unveils draft aviation policy  recommends listing of AAI  Pawan HansPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 3:29 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 5:26 pm
The state owned helicopter operator, Pawan Hans Helicopter Limited (PHHL) and airport operator, Airports Authority of India (AAI) are to be listed on the stock exchange, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said on Monday. Set up in 1985, PHHL is currently the largest helicopter operator in Asia with a fleet of 47 choppers.
After releasing the draft Civil Aviation policy on Monday, Raju also said that an expert committee would be set up to draw a future road map for Air India, “which will help it achieve its full potential”.
“If a policy existed (during the UPA rule), it was opaque. We want to develop a transparent policy because opaqueness leads itself to allegations. This government wants to work in a transparent manner,” Raju said.
The draft policy, which is now available in the public domain for greater participation from the stakeholders, proposes enhancing regional air connectivity, develop six major metro airports as international travel and transit hubs, create more airports through PPP mode, rationalise jet fuel cost, promote air cargo, Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services and helicopter operations apart from stressing on improving passenger facilitation services.
The Minister said he was hopeful that the draft policy would be finalised by January next year. “It is essential to ensure that Air India, our national carrier, achieves its full potential. An expert committee will be constituted to develop a future roadmap for Air India. AAI will be corporatised, followed by listings in the stock exchanges, in order to improve efficiency and transparency. PHHL will be listed in the stock exchanges with the same objective,” says the new draft policy.
A senior ministry official said no time frame has yet been fixed for by when the two entities will be listed or what percentage of the Government holding in the companies will be shed.
“It will be easier to list PHHL first – within the next six months – as it is already a registered company. We will work with the Department of Disinvestment, the nodal Ministry for divesting stake in PSUs. Mopping up funds is not the prime objective of the exercise in case of both the entities. It will also help bring about greater professionalism in the boards of these two entities,” the official said.
Raju, however, hinted at an eventual divestment of Air India, saying there were several suggestions made by different sections, including those in favour and those against privatisation of the national carrier.
“Some say that privatisation is a solution while others feel it should remain a public entity. Another section says the airline should be managed professionally by professional bodies. All these suggestions have emerged. It is in the country’s interest that it cruises smoothly. We don’t want to open a pandora’s box. We will have to take a conscious decision as it is a delicate matter.”
He said there were several issues as mentioned in the draft policy for which the Cabinet’s approval would be required, including a decision on the five year and 20 aircraft rule (5/20) for allowing domestic airlines continued…

ET Wealth | 10 financial tips for young couplesYou are here: Home > Collections > Inflation
How young working couples can build wealth without compromising on lifestyles
ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 08.00AM IST
Tags:
( If your investment horizon…)
By Bindisha Sarang
Life can be carefree for young working couples. They have more money and not too many financial responsibilities. But they also have more ways to spend the money. Meet Visakhapatnam-based architect Ananth Domatoti, 31, and his wife Anita Patnaik, 30. They have a combined annual income of almost Rs 22 lakh, but are not able to save even 5% of that. "I struggle to keep my expenses under control," admits Ananth.
In Mumbai, Vishal Nalawade, 30, and his wife Shraddha, 29, are facing a different problem. They have good jobs, spend carefully and save 60% of their net income every month. Yet, their finances are not really going places. In fact, their entire savings of Rs 5 lakh is idling in a bank account, earning a piffling 4% even as inflation eats into its purchasing power. Financial planners would baulk at this. "It's not very smart to keep so much money in a savings bank account. A balance of Rs 1 lakh for emergencies is more than enough," says Mumbai-based financial planner Suresh Sadagopan.
Young working couples such as the Domatotis and the Nalawades are frittering away a terrific opportunity. If they are careful in the way they save, invest and spend their money, they can transform their financial future. Apart from high incomes and few financial responsibilities, these double-income couples have time on their side. With almost 25-30 years of working life ahead of them, they can amass a huge amount using the power of compounding.
This week's cover story looks at how young couples can capitalise on the advantages to build substantial wealth without compromising too much on their lifestyles. We look at the most common mistakes that young couples are likely to make and also list out the essential steps they must take in these formative years.
When you are young and earning well, savings and investing often take a back seat. The double-income comfort tricks many couples into thinking that their saving plans can be postponed by a few years. delaying investments can be a costly mistake because the investor loses out on the power of compounding. We all know that compounding can work wonders but here's an eye opener: If one starts saving Rs 5,000 a month at the age of 30 and earns 10% compounded returns, he would have Rs 1.13 crore at the age of 60. If he delays the investment by 10 years and starts at 40, he will manage to save only Rs 38 lakh. "The sooner you begin, the bigger is the corpus. Young couples should start putting away in the initial years itself," advises Pankaj Mathpal, a Mumbai-based financial planner.
Don't save, invest
Saving alone is not enough. The Nalawades have been saving for more than one year, but instead of growing, their money has shrunk in value in real terms. Wholesale inflation may be down but consumer inflation is still raging at around 7%. If you assume an inflation rate of 7%, the 4% return on their savings idling in the bank account actually means a loss of 3%.
"I am not very clued in to financial matters so could not decide where to invest," explains Vishal, almost embarrassed about the loss in purchasing power. For young investors like him, equity mutual funds should be the instrument of choice. Identifying a good fund is not rocket science. The couple should start investing a small amount in any five-star diversified equity fund.
If the Nalawades have not deployed their money because they lack knowledge, Bengaluru-based IT professionals Aditya Vajha and his wife Sonia Kakodkar have stayed away from equities because of their past experience with the asset class. They are not even 30 but have the risk profile that even a retiree would find too conservative.
  Understanding your risk profile is very important. Young people often make the mistake of taking too little risk even though they can withstand some volatility. If your investment horizon is more than 5-6 years, there is no reason why you should be investing in debt instruments that offer very low yields. The Domatotis are putting away their entire investible surplus in recurring deposits. They should consider equity funds which can give them better returns. Of course, they should do this in a graded manner.
This approach will especially be suitable for Vajha and Kakodkar, who have vowed to stay away from equities due to past losses. Instead of investing and saving for their other goals, they are aggressively paying down their home loan. Apart from the EMI of Rs 37,000, they put their entire monthly surplus of Rs 50,000 in a home saver account to prepay the home loan. "It's good to be debt free but in their bid to prepay their home loan they may be compromising their future," says Parag Paranjpe, a financial planner. At least Rs 10,000 should be diverted to an SIP in a good diversified equity fund. If they are still fearful, they could consider a balanced fund.

PM: Ayurveda can make a global impact  like YogaPM: Ayurveda can make a global impact, like Yoga
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | November 10, 2014 09:37 IST
Seeking to dispel the notion of Ayurveda and Allopathy being competing streams of medical science, the Prime Minister described Ayurveda as a way of life.
 
 
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today said the biggest challenge to Ayurveda comes from people who have dedicated their life to it. They too do not trust it fully, he said. 
Seeking to dispel the notion of Ayurveda and Allopathy being competing streams of medical science, the Prime Minister described Ayurveda as a way of life. He said a disease can be cured by Allopathy; and if a person adopts Ayurveda, he can ensure that he remains healthy and free of disease.
He called upon practitioners of Ayurveda to be dedicated to Ayurveda not just as a profession, but as a service to mankind. He was speaking at the valedictory function of the 6th World Ayurveda Congress.
The Prime Minister said that Yoga had acquired global recognition for people who wanted a stress-free life and were moving towards holistic healthcare. Similarly, if Ayurveda is presented in the right spirit as a way of life, it too can acquire acceptance.
The Prime Minister said it is essential for Ayurveda to reach people in a simple, effective way. For this, the modes of treatment should also be better packaged. Shri Narendra Modi said space has to be created in international medical and science publications, for articles on Ayurveda. But the effort for this has to come from the practitioners and researchers of Ayurveda, he added.

Titagarh Wagons lifts suspension of workTitagarh Wagons lifts suspension of work
Jayanta Mallick
Tweet
Kolkata, Nov 10:  
Titagarh Wagons said that it has lifted the suspension of work at its factory near here from Monday.
The company had suspended work on September 6 following alleged hooliganism at the plant. Lifting of suspension came after a tri-partite agreement among the company, the State Government and the workers’ representatives.
The company said operation at the plant was affected during the last month of the July-September quarter. JP Chowdhary, Chairman of the company, told BusinessLine this, along with two other factors, hit the bottomline of Titagarh Wagons in the quarter ended September 30, 2014.
In notes to the quarterly profit and loss account, the company also said that though it had entered into a contract with the Indian Railways for supplying 1,538 wagons during the fiscal, lower pricing of wagons this year and higher input cost caused a margin squeeze.
“Considering the market situation as also as a prudential practice, we have recognised a loss of Rs 17.10 crore during the quarter,” Chowdhary said.
The company reported a net loss of Rs 10.25 crore during Q2 against a net profit of Rs 1.77 crore in the corresponding quarter last financial year.
Merger of subsidiaries
Meanwhile, Titagarh Wagons has planned to merge some of its subsidiaries with it. A scheme of amalgamation of the subsidiaries aims to absorb the businesses or interests of the companies.
As a result, Cimmco Ltd, another subsidiary of the company, would be a wholly-owned subsidiary. The fledgling ship-building business of the group would also be merged with TWL. Currently, the group operates a brownfield Hooghly riverside yard. It is also developing another Greenfield facility near here.
On the BSE, the stock closed at Rs 269, up 3.62 per cent.

Joint venture to offer farmers in AP, Telangana warehouse receipt financing
New Delhi, Nov 10:  
Collateral management firm Origo Commodities today said it has tied up with Nabard to provide ‘warehouse receipt financing’ to farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
Under this facility, farmers are allowed to deposit the crop at a warehouse closest to their farms and obtain pledge financing from banks to the extent of 70-75 per cent of the value of the commodity.
The joint initiative will enable farmers to use the warehousing infrastructure of Primary Agriculture Co-operative Societies (PACS) and also more than 100 warehouses managed by Origo Commodities across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
“This memorandum of understanding (MoU) is going to help farmers to a great extent by realising the right price by offering them options to sell their produce at the right time,” Nabard Chief General Manager at the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana Regional Office, Jiji Mammen, said in a statement.
The initiative also focuses on Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) accreditation so that farmers can benefit from post-harvest loans at 7 per cent per annum with interest subvention, he added.
Origo Commodities Director Sunoor Kaul said since the key to success will be to ensure rural infrastructure accessible to farmers during the post-harvest period, the company will extend support in creating multiple integrated marketing platforms and storage facilities to sustain the activities of PACs and FPOs.
Under the MoU, Nabard and Origo Commodities will be creating awareness among PACs and farmers on Negotiable Warehouse Receipts and measures to avoid “distress sale” at the time of harvest, the company added.

Blackmoney to return in a year: SwamyLetters to  the editor
Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy expressed hope that the black money stashed in foreign banks would return to the country in about one year.
“We are optimistic that the black money stashed in foreign banks would return to the country in about one year time, much before the expectation of the people,” Swamy told reporters here.
Rejecting apprehension that the Centre was taking time on the matter of bringing black money back, Swamy said it was taking some time as about one million bank accounts have been opened by Indians in 70 odd countries.
About Rs 120 lakh crore were stashed in foreign banks, the senior BJP leader said.
On the National Herald case in which Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were named, Swamy said, “The Supreme Court in 2007 had given a direction to set up a special investigation team for the purpose. But, they did nothing till the NDA government came to the power.
“There has been an attempt to grab properties worth Rs 5,000 crore simply by forming a private limited company in the name of Young Indian Ltd by Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Motilal Vora and others,” Swamy said about the case initiated by him.
Stating that the paid off capital of the company was only Rs 5 lakh, Swamy alleged there had been fraud, breach of trust by manipulation.
“Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi own 76 per cent of the share on the private limited company,” he pointed out.
Swamy claimed that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, as majority shareholders of Young Indian Ltd (YIL), benefited from the acquisition of Associated Journals Ltd (AJL).

The investment is part of the company’s plan to invest USD 100 million in Indian power sector by 2016.
“Toshiba Corporation will reinforce its transmission and distribution (T&D) business in India with a 3 billion yen (approximately USD 30 million) investment in new production capacity at Toshiba Transmission & Distribution Systems India Private Ltd (TTDI) in Hyderabad,” the company said in a statement.
“India is a high-growth market that Toshiba has positioned as a strategic base for its power-related businesses.
“In the period to FY16, Toshiba plans to invest a cumulative 10-billion yen (approximately USD 100 million) in its T&D business there, including this current round of investment,” said Katsutoshi Toda, CMD, TTDI.
“Toshiba is seeking to secure a 20 per cent share of the Indian market by 2018, and also reinforce TTDI as a core T&D production base for other major markets, including Europe, ASEAN, and Africa,” Toda said.
A new facility for large power transformers will come on line in 2015 at Hyderabad at the same time as the full scale launch of a new unit for switchgears.
Alongside its existing production line of small and medium capacity transformers and low and medium voltage switchgears, the new power transformer line will support production of 765 kV (kilovolt) transformers with a capacity of 500 MVA (mega volt ampere), while the new switchgear line will produce high voltage products.
Toshiba established TTDI in 2013 by acquiring T&D business from Vijai Electricals for 20 billion yen or approximately USD 200 million, and also started operation of a new power transformer facility in Russia in February 2014.

Bharat Forge Q2 net up 81 pc to Rs 174.49 croreEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Auto components firm Bharat Forge today reported an 81.04 per cent jump in its standalone net profit at Rs 174.49 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014 on the back of robust export growth.
The company’s net profit stood at Rs 96.38 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal, Bharat Forge said in a filing to the BSE.
Total sales of the company in the July-September quarter of FY 2014-15 stood at Rs 1,138.27 crore, up 34.68 per cent from Rs 845.11 crore during the same period a year ago.
“Q2 FY15 performance has been better than expected on the back of continued robust export growth, in particular from North American Industrial and Commercial Vehicle market,” Bharat Forge CMD B N Kalyani said.
He further added: “Leveraging our in-house R&D and Innovation capabilities, we developed new products and technologies enabling us to win our maiden order from SAFRAN and two other global OEM’s in the Aerospace sector for supply of mission critical forgings.”
On the outlook, Kalyani said demand would improve across all segment with volumes.
“We expect North America demand to increase while Europe is expected to soften a bit. We expect the domestic industrial sector to increase in the next two quarters largely driven by ‘Make in India’ initiatives of the Government of India,” he said.
For the first half of 2014-15, the company’s standalone net profit increased 70.85 per cent to Rs 319.46 crore as compared to Rs 186.98 crore in the same period last year.

1975 L N Mishra murder case: Court fixes Dec 8 forverdictPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:38 pm
A Delhi court today fixed December 8 for pronouncement of verdict in a case relating to the murder of former Railway Minister L N Mishra at a function in Bihar nearly 40 years ago.
District Judge Vinod Goel, who had reserved the verdict for today, deferred it saying the judgement was not ready.
“Judgement not ready yet. Put up for December 8,” the judge said.
After hearing the final arguments of the counsel for CBI and the four accused on September 12, the court had reserved its judgement for today. The final arguments had begun in September, 2012.
The case relates to the bomb blast at a function attended by Mishra at Samastipur Railway Station on January 2, 1975. He succumbed to injuries the next day.
Over 200 witnesses, including 161 prosecution witnesses and more than 40 defence witnesses, were examined in the case.
Advocate Ranjan Dwivedi, who was 24-year-old at that time, was named as an accused along with four Ananda Marga group members, one of whom has died.
Apart from Dwivedi, three other accused in the case are Santoshananda Avadhuta, Sudevananda Avadhuta and Gopalji.
The accused had earlier approached the Supreme Court for quashing of the trial against them in the murder case.
The apex court had on August 17, 2012 dismissed their pleas on the ground that the proceedings could not be quashed merely because they had not been concluded in the last 37 years.
The charge sheet in the case was filed on November 1,1977 in a CBI court in Patna. The case was shifted to Delhi in 1979 on a plea by the then Attorney General to the apex court.
Except Gopalji, all those listed in the charge sheet in Mishra murder case were also named as accused in an attempt to murder case related to the bid on the life of then Chief Justice of India A N Ray in Delhi on March 20, 1975.

Fishermen death row: PM Narendra Modi talks to PresidentRajapaksaPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:21 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 6:38 pm
Government on Monday said it has accorded “very high priority” to bring back five Indian fishermen on death row from Sri Lanka and every possible avenue is being explored to ensure their safe return.
Terming it as a “delicate” matter, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said the government will do everything possible to bring home the fishermen.
“We are pursuing all avenues. We are pursuing it to best of our ability and we have not reached a situation or a stage where we could say that it has reached a happy conclusion,” he told reporters.
Asked about reports of Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking to Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday on the issue, the spokesperson evaded the question, citing sensitivity of the issue.
Emerson, P Augustus, R Wilson, K Prasath and J Langlet, all hailing from Tamil Nadu, were apprehended in 2011 and were sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court on October 30 for alleged drug trafficking.
“We will do everything possible to ensure return of those five Indian fishermen in accordance with Sri Lanka’s legal and executive process.
“It is a matter on which we place very high priority. It is also a matter on which we are exploring a variety of avenues to ensure that those citizens of India return to India safely. These avenues are being pursued in accordance with the Sri Lanka’s legal system and Sri Lanka’s executive role in the process,” the Spokesperson said.
Asked about Sri Lankan government’s response on the issue, he only said both countries have “extremely cordial” relationship and the country always reciprocates positively to India’s efforts.
“India and Sri lanka have an extremely cordial relationship. We are in regular touch with each other. We have a relationship in which both of us understand each other’s requirements, needs and concerns.

Indian cos need govt support to counter Chin...Bharti Airtel
("We are facing might of Chinese…)
NEW DELHI: Indian companies will need active help from the new government in expanding overseas, but such support has been lacking in the past as against China which has always put its might behind its enterprises, leading industrialist Sunil Bharti Mittal said today.
"We are facing might of Chinese state wherever we go abroad," said Mittal, who heads telecom-to-retail conglomerate Bharti group.
Sharing his experiences from the past, Mittal said when his company ventured into Sri Lanka, the government there was expecting assistance of $100 million for a project.
"I conveyed it in MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) and officers in PMO (Prime Minister Office) but nothing moved after that. I could only convey. Few months after that, China doled out cheque of $1 billion to Sri Lanka which helped its companies," Mittal said at the India Global Forum here.
He said Indian companies started venturing abroad and investing big after Tata acquired European steel firm Corus in 2006 and soon it was followed by acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover.
"Indian companies are making big investments abroad. Some of them are extremely successful, some moderate and some are in the process. In Africa, I have seen good amount of goodwill for India. Though we cannot match the amount of money they (China) commit in Africa but government can support Indian businesses there," Mittal said.
Airtel acquired African telecom operator Zain in 2010 for $10.7 billion. The telecom major operates in 17 African countries but is yet to register profit.
At the same event, Wockhardt Chairman and Group CEO Habil Khorakiwala said that Indian companies have brought down price of HIV drugs by about 98 per cent in Africa which was earlier unaffordable for people there.
Mittal said positive changes are taking place under the new government but more needs to be done.
"PM (Narendra Modi) is now making bold moves overseas. He asked us to introduce ourself in Japan," Mittal said.
But unlike foreign businessmen who are made part of delegation when their ministers visit overseas, Indian businessmen are given a badge which says "coinciding with visit of Prime Minister", he added.
"I have asked senior officials to at least make 'accompanying' if not call it delegates. We deserve some respect," Mittal said.
Bharti Enterprise chairman recalled a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Russian President Vladimir Putin where Russian conglomerate Sistema's chairman Yevtushenkov was present during the meeting between heads of the two states.

Domestic LPG cannot be sold to non-PSU entitiesIndian Oil Corp
(The government's top law…)
NEW DELHI: In a setback to non-state LPG marketeers , the government's top law officer has ruled that all domestically produced cooking gas (LPG) should necessarily be sold to PSUs for subsidised sale to consumers.
Ranjit Kumar, Solicitor General of India (SGI), the nation's second highest law offer, has upheld oil ministry view that sale of LPG by domestic producers to anyone other than state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) is not permissible under LPG Control Order.
In his opinion on a query by the ministry, he said non-state LPG sellers , called parallel marketeers, cannot source the fuel from domestic refiners. They have to import LPG if they intend to sell the cooking fuel in domestic market.
Sources said Kumar in his opinion upheld ministry's view that parallel marketeer's distribution/sale in the domestic market could only be of imported LPG subject to conditions prescribed in the LPG Control Order.
While India is surplus in refining capacity, it does not produce enough LPG to meet all of its demand. LPG is produced by both public sector firms like Indian Oil Corp (IOC) as well as private firms like Reliance Industries. This LPG is sold to consumer mostly through distributors appointed by government at subsidised rates.
Reliance Industries, the largest single location LPG producer in the country, had last year contested the ministry view saying rules do not mandate that all domestic LPG must be sold only to state firms. It had allegedly sold the cooking gas produced at its Jamangar, Hazira and Patalganga plants to retail customers.
Sources said the SGI on ministry's query on what action should be initiated against those LPG producer who had sold LPG in parallel market, said the action should be in accordance with the law.
Kumar stated that parallel marketers were allowed to sell LPG sourced from domestic refiners from 2005. And so, they should be first given a notice/warning that they cannot sell domestically produced LPG to the consumer directly and action as per law may be taken only if they do not adhere to the notice/warning.
The SGI said the LPG Control Order of 2000 defines parallel marketeer as someone who is carrying on business of importing, storing, transporting, marketing and distributing of LPG. It does not prohibit the parallel marketeer from producing LPG but it cannot sell such production directly to consumers.
The LPG Order nowhere permits the domestically produced LPG to be sold by a parallel marketeer, who is a person other than a government oil company, and that such parallel marketeer could only distribute/sell imported LPG.

DDA receives 10 lakh applications for 2014 housing schemeDDA receives over 10 lakh applications for 2014 housing scheme
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 17:22 IST
DDA has received over 10 lakh applications for the flagship 'Housing Scheme 2014' and it will on Monday conduct a dry run to check its preparedness for the much-awaited draw of lots.
The tentative date for holding the draw of the lots for the new scheme was November 10, but a senior official of the housing authority today said that the exact date would be decided based on the outcome of Monday's trial.
"We are going to hold a dry run on Monday to test our preparedness for conducting the draw, like the technological elements involved, so as to mitigate any contingency situations on the day of the draw. The exact date for it would be decided accordingly," the official told PTI.
The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for the first time has also planned to webcast the entire event live on YouTube, and so the run serves as a means to test everything in working conditions so as to avoid any glitches later on.
The webcast would be available for "unlimited" number of online users through the YouTube channel.
The scheme, which was launched on September 1 had seen a massive response both online and offline, leading to DDA's website getting crashed within few hours on the opening day itself.
The last date for the scheme was October 9 but the date was extended till October 15 later. Till then 7.5 lakh applications were received. The number rose to 8.5 lakh a few days later as applications from far-flung bank branches reached the DDA headquarters here late.
"The number of received applications has now crossed 10 lakh and that is pretty much the final figure, we would say. People are going online as they can check their application status on our website, where the procedure for conducting the draw has also been uploaded," she said.
The housing scheme offers over 25,000 flats across various categories, ranging from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore.
Although about 17 lakh brochures were sold through DDA counters and the branches of its various empanelled banks, officials ascribed the "lukewarm response" to the scheme to the lock-in period and the nature of flats on offer.
"The primary reason for the not-so-overwhelming response, despite selling so many brochures, could be the five-year lock -in period for the ownership of the flats, which we have introduced for the first time.
"Besides, most flats are of lower range, one-bedroom types, so that could be another factor," the official said.

China unveils Mars rover after India s Manga...China unveils Mars rover after India's successful Mangalyaan
By PTI | 10 Nov, 2014, 05.05PM IST
Photos of the rover's prototype, to be displayed at the annual air show at Zhuai being attended by Defence Attaches of all countries including India, were carried by the State-run Xinhua news agency.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BEIJING: Seeking to catch up with India's Mangalyaan mission, China has unveiled its Mars rover being developed to scurry the Red Planet's surface for signs of water and life and plans to test it in the rugged terrain of Tibet.
China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) has displayed the machine and the technological hardware set-up at an air show.
Photos of the rover's prototype, to be displayed at the annual air show at Zhuai being attended by Defence Attaches of all countries including India, were carried by the State-run Xinhua news agency.
The robotic rover was to crawl over the rough Martian terrain with a powerful six-wheel drive.
At a glace it looks similar to Yutu or Jade Rabbit that China has sent to Moon to explore the lunar surface.
But the Chinese scientists carried out some significant design changes to deal with different environment on Mars, the Hong Kong based South China Morning Post reported.
To beef up communication at longer distance, the rover carries on its back a large dish antenna, which was smaller and mounted at the neck on Yutu.
The wheels were also more solidly constructed than those on Yutu in order to deal with a rockier landscape.
The entire Mars exploration system will include an orbiter, lander and the rover, CASC said.
Some intriguing issues regarding the rover, such as whether it would carry a nuclear power source and the types of scientific payload on board, have still not been answered, the Post said.
Yutu was crippled soon after landing on the moon, probably due to low temperatures and fine dust. The average temperature on Mars is lower than that of the Moon due to its distance from the sun, and the notorious dust storms would also be imposing enormous challenge to the rover.
Ouyang Ziyuan, Chief Scientist of China's lunar project, told state media earlier this year that China's second mission to Mars would be launched as early as 2020, and that by 2030 an unmanned spacecraft would return from the planet with samples.
While Mangalyaan caught China by surprise, it fascinated them as it was sent with a modest budget of less than $100 million.

Kingfisher shares plunge 5% on trading suspension orderKingfisher, UB Engg shares plunge 5% as bourses decide to suspend trading
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 13:12 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
Shares of Kingfisher Airlines and UB Engineering fell as much as five per cent on Monday after top bourses - Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) - announced suspension of trading in the shares of these firms from December.
Kingfisher's shares plunged 4.64 per cent to its lowest trading permissible limit for the day at Rs 1.85 on the BSE.
Shares of UB Engineering also fell by 4.96 per cent to hit its lower circuit limit of Rs 7.67. Selling was also seen in other UB Group stocks, where UBHL was trading lower by 3.24 per cent, followed by McDowell Holdings (down 2.74 per cent) and United Breweries (down 0.44 per cent).
In a major clampdown over non-compliance of Listing Agreement the two top bourses (BSE and NSE), in separate circulars, had said that trading would be suspended in securities of Kingfisher and UB Engineering - both parts of crisis-hit UB Group headed by Vijay Mallya - with effect from December 1.
Besides, the entire promoter shareholding of these companies were frozen with effect from Friday itself.
The action follows non-compliance to a Listing Agreement clause relating to timely preparation and disclosure of financial results by a listed company for two consecutive quarters. The results are required to be disclosed by listed companies on stock exchange platform for benefit of investors.

Is your Provident Fund enough to retire rich | Smart money moves for young couplesAllianz
(To ensure a comfortable…)
If you dream about a comfortable retirement but are planning to depend solely on your Provident Fund (PF) to meet your needs, be ready for a shock. The PF can be an important pillar in a retirement plan, but the corpus of the average subscriber is likely to fall woefully short of his requirement. One needs to make additional investments to build a corpus big enough to sustain one's expenses for 20-odd years after retiring.
To be fair, the Provident Fund's design makes it the most effective way to save for retirement. You start contributing from the very month you start earning, and since it is a compulsory saving, you can't avoid it. Besides, your contribution is linked to your income and rises with every increment in your salary. If a person takes up a job at the age of 25, even a modest contribution of Rs 5,000 a month and a matching contribution by his employer can build up a massive corpus of Rs 6.89 crore over 35 years. This calculation assumes that his income (and, therefore, the contribution) will rise by 8% every year and the PF will give 8.5% returns.
While the figure of Rs 6.89 crore may appear huge, it may not be enough. If you need Rs 50,000 a month for living expenses today, a 7% inflation would push up the requirement to roughly Rs 5.34 lakh a month in 35 years. When you are 60, you would need a corpus of Rs 10.52 crore to sustain inflation-adjusted withdrawals for the next 20 years (see table). Assuming a post-tax return of 8.5% and 7% inflation, the Rs 6.89 crore from the PF would be completely wiped out in a little over 12 years. This could mean having no money in your retirement account at the age of 72.
  There's another problem. To make your PF work for you, you must remain invested for the long term. However, a lot of people withdraw their PF when they change jobs, thus losing out on the power of compounding. "In India, the PF is often used for other purposes, particularly when people change jobs. They end up withdrawing this accumulated corpus to buy expensive gadgets or go on a holiday, forgetting that the purpose was retirement planning," says Arvind Usretay, India Retirement Business Leader, Mercer. A recent global survey by Mercer has ranked India's retirement system the lowest among the 25 countries surveyed. "What continues to hold India back is the lack of retirement coverage for the informal sector and less than adequate retirement income expected to be generated from contributions made to the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and gratuity benefits," notes the Mercer study.
Another global study by Towers Watson points out that a significant majority of employees sees their employer retirement plans as the most important source of income in retirement. "Employers must educate their employees on the need for retirement planning and provide them the tools to help them save adequately," says Anuradha Sriram, director, benefits, Towers Watson, India.
To ensure a comfortable life in retirement, one needs to make additional investments to build a corpus big enough to sustain one's expenses for nearly 20 years in retirement. Here are a few options you can consider.
Mutual funds
Mutual funds are, perhaps, the best way to supplement your retirement savings. Among these, equity mutual funds have the potential to give very high returns, but also carry high risk. They are best suited to younger investors who can withstand short-term volatility to earn long-term gains. "Equity funds should be the instrument of choice for young investors who have 25-30 years to build a retirement kitty," says Suresh Sadagopan, founder of Ladder7 Financial Advisories. An additional advantage of investing in equity funds is that the gains are tax-free.
If you are averse to taking risks, consider a balanced fund, where the equity exposure is lower. Ultra cautious investors can go for MIPs of mutual funds that invest only 15-20% of their corpus in stocks and put the rest in bonds. However, the returns of MIPs will not be able to match those of equity and balanced funds.
Ulips
Ulips have earned a bad name because of the rampant misselling in the past. However, this much reviled product can be a good option for retirement planning. In recent months, insurance companies have come out with online plans that levy very low charges. The Click2Protect plan from HDFC Life charges an annual fund management fee of 1.35%, which is less than the direct mutual fund charges. The Bajaj Allianz Future Gain plan does not levy premium allocation charges if the annual investment is Rs 2 lakh and above. The Edelweiss Tokio Wealth Accumulation Plan doesn't have policy administration charges. Some Ulips, such as Aviva i-Growth and ICICI Prudential Elite Life II, don't have lower charges but compensate long-term investors with 'loyalty additions'. The best part in a Ulip is that one can shift money from debt to equity, and vice versa, without incurring any tax liability. The corpus is also taxfree on maturity.

Watch: How Boko Haram runs a townprint
A new Boko Haram video obtained by AFP on Sunday shows militants on an armoured vehicle parading down a road in an unidentified town they apparently control and the group's leader Abubakar Shekau preaching to locals.
It was not possible to tell whether the footage was staged for propaganda purposes, especially scenes of residents cheering Islamist fighters.
The message appeared to be aimed at reinforcing Shekau's claim that he has created a caliphate within Nigeria.
In the 44-minute video, Boko Haram voices support for other so-called caliphates, including the one proclaimed in Iraq and Syria by the Islamic State (IS) group.
Shekau, who is pictured in closeup shots with rare clarity, again dismisses government claims about ceasefire talks.
'Living in a caliphate'
 
The video, which was delivered through the same channels as past messages, shows armed men lined along a well-paved road, with three pick-up trucks bristling with heavy weapons also visible.
Black, crested flags associated with the Islamist group are also shown.
Later, an armoured vehicle rolls down the road lined with both fighters and individuals who appear to be residents of the town.
Boko Haram has released a series of videos showing similar military hardware, equipment it says was stolen from the Nigerian military. Such claims have been impossible to verify.
No women or girls are seen on the street or anywhere else in the footage.
Most of the message is taken up by a sermon from Shekau, delivered indoors but apparently played on a speaker to locals assembled outside.
"We have indeed established an Islamic caliphate," he said, restating a claim he first made in August.
The images of the sermon include unusually clear closeups of the Nigerian militant leader.
 
 
Shekau has previously expressed solidarity with other jihadi groups and leaders.
In the latest video, he seemed to associate territory under his control with a wider, global caliphate, but did not submit to the authority of any other jihadi leader.
"To everyone living in Islamic Caliphate, we convey our greetings," he said, specifically mentioning "brethren" in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Shishan (an Islamist term for Chechnya), Yemen, Somalia and "the Caliphate in Iraq and Syria."
A graphic shown later includes a picture the IS group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as well as a portion of the message his group issued on July 1 proclaiming a caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
Iraq on Sunday was investigating whether Baghdadi was killed in air strikes by US-led coalition warplanes.
 
'There is no truce'
 
Nigeria maintains it is still negotiating with Boko Haram envoys in neighbouring Chad and that a disputed October 17 ceasefire declaration remains viable.
Violence has however continued and the Islamists are believed to control more than two dozen towns and villages in the northeast.
"There is no truce between me and Nigerian tyrants," Shekau said, dismissing the credibility of Danladi Amhadu, the purported rebel negotiator.
"This person Danladi... if he thinks he can, let him show his face. By Allah, we will kill him," the Islamist leader said.

Kolkata, Nov 10:  
The Union Government has set up a Rs 2,000-crore corpus for Nabard to help lend to food processing units at a “lower interest rate”.
According to Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Union Minister for Food Processing Industries, loans would be provided to units located both inside and outside mega-food parks.
“Initially, the idea was to facilitate loans for units inside the mega-food parks. But then it was extended to include all units – both inside and outside the food parks,” she told reporters on the sidelines of a food processing seminar organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce (BCC) here in the city on Monday.

Setback to non-State marketeers: Domestic LPG cannot be soldSetback to non-State marketeers: Domestic LPG cannot be sold
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 10:  
In a setback to non-state LPG marketeers, the Government’s top law officer has ruled that all domestically produced cooking gas (LPG) should necessarily be sold to PSUs for subsidised sale to consumers.
Ranjit Kumar, Solicitor-General of India (SGI), the nation’s second highest law offer, has upheld the Oil Ministry view that sale of LPG by domestic producers to anyone other than State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) is not permissible under the LPG Control Order.
In his opinion on a query by the Ministry, he said non-State LPG sellers, called parallel marketeers, cannot source the fuel from domestic refiners. They have to import LPG if they intend to sell the cooking fuel in the domestic market.
Sources said Kumar in his opinion upheld the Ministry’s view that parallel marketeers’ distribution/sale in the domestic market could only be of imported LPG subject to conditions prescribed in the LPG Control Order.
While India is surplus in refining capacity, it does not produce enough LPG to meet all of its demand. LPG is produced by both public sector firms such as Indian Oil Corp (IOC) as well as private firms such as Reliance Industries. This LPG is sold to consumers mostly through distributors appointed by the Government at subsidised rates.
Reliance Industries, the largest single location LPG producer in the country, had last year contested the Ministry view saying rules do not mandate that all domestic LPG must be sold only to State firms. It had allegedly sold the cooking gas produced at its Jamangar, Hazira and Patalganga plants to retail customers.
Sources said the SGI on the Ministry’s query on what action should be initiated against those LPG producers who had sold LPG in the parallel market, said the action should be in accordance with the law.
Kumar stated that parallel marketers were allowed to sell LPG sourced from domestic refiners from 2005. And so, they should be first given a notice/ warning that they cannot sell domestically produced LPG to the consumer directly and action as per law may be taken only if they do not adhere to the notice/ warning.
The SGI said the LPG Control Order of 2000 defines a parallel marketeer as someone who is carrying on the business of importing, storing, transporting, marketing and distributing LPG. It does not prohibit the parallel marketeer from producing LPG but it cannot sell such production directly to consumers.
The LPG Order nowhere permits domestically produced LPG to be sold by a parallel marketeer, who is a person other than a Government oil company, and that such parallel marketeer could only distribute/sell imported LPG.

19th century railway section in Assam hills yearns for heritagestatusA 47-km portion encircling the picturesque hill station of Haflong has remained untouched, including its century-old buildings mostly made of stones and timber. (Source: Samudra Gupta Kashyap)
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 10, 2014 5:13 pm
Even as the railways are currently engaged in replacing the 111-year old metre-gauge Lumding-Badarpur Hill Section into a broad-gauge track, a 47-km stretch of the historic line, literally forming a garland around Haflong, Assam’s only hill station, is waiting to be conferred heritage status. The Assam government meanwhile has written to the railways asking them not to dismantle it, so that it could be promoted as a tourist attraction.
While the 225-km Lumding-Badarpur Hill Section – often described as the “most spectacular mountain line of Indian Railways” –  is currently in its last phase of gauge conversion – to be completed by April 2015 – a 47-km portion encircling the picturesque hill station of Haflong has remained untouched, including its century-old buildings mostly made of stones and timber. The 47-km portion has nine stations – Mahur, Migrendisa, Lower Haflong, Bagetar, Haflong Hill, Jatinga, Longrangjao, Mailongdisa and Harangajao – each one a heritage in its own right.
As a group of citizens of Haflong, highly concerned about preserving that 47-km stretch has asked the government to declare it a heritage track and promote it as a tourist attraction, the state government on its part has written to the Railways saying it was serious about retaining and promoting this 47-km stretch as a heritage track. The Hill Section that was considered as a “magnificent engineering feat” of the 19th century, the world’s steepest section (Harangajao-Jatinga) with a minimum gradient of 1:37 will continue to live once a final decision to preserve it is inked.
Officials at the Northeast Frontier Railway headquarters in Guwahati said they were waiting for a “concrete proposal” from the Assam government on how it wants to utilize the 47-km stretch that will be otherwise abandoned and dismantled. “While the Railway Board had recommended dismantling of the Mahur-Haragajao portion because it is not on the new BG alignment, we at NF Railways decided to ask the state government whether it wants us to retain it. The chief secretary replied in the affirmative. Now we are waiting for a concrete proposal from the Assam government,” NF Railway CPRO Sugato Lahiri said.
“The government has already asked the railways not to dismantle the 47-km stretch and the stations on it. We are drawing up a plan to preserve, maintain and promote this portion as a heritage track complete with steam engines and vintage salons,” Dhrubajyoti Hazarika, secretary, tourism, government of Assam told The Indian Express today.
Hazarika said while Jatinga, the village where birds mysteriously flock to commit suicide, has been a global attraction, all the other places along the track including Haflong town together would be promoted as a new package soon. While Haflong has an elevation of about 1685 feet, Jatinga is the tallest station in the Northeast, standing at 2156 feet above sea level.

Suresh Kalmadi quizzed in National GamesscamKalmadi, who remained from 12.15 pm to around 2.30 pm at the Vigilance Bureau, said he answered whatever the officials asked.
By: Express News Service | Ranchi | Posted: November 11, 2014 3:00 am
Former Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chief Suresh Kalmadi on Monday joined the Vigilance inquiry into the 2011 National Games in Ranchi, with the principal investigator saying it was too early to rule him out as an accused.
Kalmadi was asked to be present after two arrested accused in the scam told interrogators that they were merely procuring equipment that was recommended by the IOA.
Kalmadi’s interrogation could mean the investigators are the doorstep of the Commonwealth Games 2010 Organising Committee as well, as multiple vendors associated with the 2010 event were allegedly awarded questionable deals by the committee.
“I am merely a witness in the case, not an accused,” Kalmadi told journalists outside the Vigilance office in Ranchi after spending two hours answering a questionnaire.
“We will ask him to come back if needed. He will be made an accused if evidence turns up against him,” said Assistant Superintendent of Police Anand Joseph Tigga.
The first arrests into the 34th edition of the games were made on October 14 this year, with Vigilance officials arresting former Sports Department Director P C Mishra and Organising Committee Secretary S M Hashmi.

Jitan Ram Manjhi hits back at BJP over demand toquitBy: Press Trust of India | Patna | Posted: November 10, 2014 5:03 pm
Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi Monday hit back at BJP, which has been demanding his resignation in the wake of the controversial appointment of his son-in-law, saying the saffron party had given important posts to people facing corruption and rape charges.
“Why shall I resign? The BJP, which is asking for my resignation, should first answer about giving important posts to people like Y S Yeduruppa and even those facing vigilance cases and rape charges,” Manjhi told reporters on the sidelines of a ‘Janata ke Darbar Mein Mukhya Mantri’ programme at his residence.
He, however, refused to identify the BJP leader facing rape charges and vigilance cases.
On the controversial appointment of his son-in-law Devendra Kumar as his Personal Assistant (PA) against rules, Manjhi accepted it was a “mistake due to lack of information” which was corrected once his attention was drawn to it.
“The chapter is closed now,” he said.
Senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and other party leaders had demanded Manjhi’s resignation over the issue.
Manjhi also rubbished reports of “differences” with his predecessor Nitish Kumar.
“He is running the party (JD-U) and I am running the government,” he said.
Asked if he would be part of Kumar’s ‘Samparak Yatra’ starting from November 13, the Chief Minister said, “It’s a party programme where I cannot go as a CM. But, if party workers demand my presence anywhere, I will be happy to be there.”
Manjhi, who had a nearly two hour-long meeting with Kumar on November 7 amid reports of a growing distance between the two leaders, said he received “tips” from Kumar for running the government more effectively.
Dismissing reports of Kumar avoiding to share dais with him as wrong, he said Nitish could not attend some of the functions with him due to personal reasons and prior engagements.
Asked if the JD(U) and the RJD should merge in the wake of efforts to bring old the Janata parivar together, Manjhi said, “Leaders like Sharad Yadav, Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar can comment on such issues, not me.”
He, however, stressed on an alliance between JD(U), RJD and Congress in the coming Assembly elections to repeat the performance of the recent by-elections in which they won six seats out of ten.

Parrikar said he will need some time to get acquainted with the ministry.
“My work is targeted completion of whatever is required to strengthen India through the defence forces.
“Only due to my lack of information… because I was the Chief Minister of Goa, I was not the Defence Minister. I was not even in the Centre. Therefore, on this, give me a week to have a complete understanding. I will talk to the Prime Minister after that I will reply,” he said.

“Unless I study the department properly, and it won’t take much time… after that I will reply,” Parrikar said.
Talking about the elections, Parrikar said he was proud of getting a chance to represent Uttar Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha.
“After filing nomination for Rajya Sabha from this state I am feeling proud. This state, which has given big leaders, which is the land of Ram-Krishna, which is the starting point of the history of the country… I got a chance to represent such a state, I consider myself lucky,” he said.

He said he was grateful to the MLAs, the party and most importantly the people of UP.
“I assure that with best of my abilities, not only I will serve the nation, but also ensure that whatever my skills and abilities are, they are used to the maximum for UP. I guarantee this to you people,” he said

TOPICS
act of terror
A suicide bomber disguised in school uniform detonated explosives at a high school assembly in the northeast Nigerian city of Potiskum on Monday, killing at least 48 students, according to survivors and a mortuary attendant.
Soldiers rushed to the scene, grisly with body parts, in the capital of Yobe state, but they were chased away with stones and calls by people angry at the military’s inability to halt a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes.
Some 2,000 students had gathered for Monday morning’s weekly assembly at the Government Technical Science College when the explosion blasted through the school hall, according to survivors.
“We were waiting for the principal to address us, around 7.30 am, when we heard a deafening sound and I was blown off my feet, people started screaming and running, I saw blood all over my body,” 17-year-old student Musa Ibrahim Yahaya said from the general hospital, where he was being treated for head wounds.
A mortuary attendant said 48 bodies were brought to the hospital and all appeared to be between the ages of 11 and 20 years old.
Survivors said the bomber appeared to have hidden the explosives in the type of rucksack popular with students.
A suicide bomb attack in the same city killed 30 people one week ago, when suspected Boko Haram fighters attacked a religious procession.

Six out of 10 men in India admit violence against wives: UN studyComments
Six out of 10 men in India admit to having perpetrated violence against their wives or partners, with men who experienced discrimination as children or faced financial stresses more likely to be abusive, said a study released on Monday.
The report, by the United Nations World Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Washington-based International Center for Research on Women, polled 9,205 men, aged 18 to 49, across seven states to understand their views on masculinity, partner violence and son preference.
Violence was defined as emotional such as insults, intimidation and threats, or physical and sexual such as pushing, punching and rape. It also included economic abuse in which a man did not permit his wife or partner to work or took her earnings against her will.
"Many men in India act in a manner that is fairly predetermined by their gendered roles and expectations, socio-economic characteristics and childhood experiences," said the 'Masculinity, Intimate Partner Violence and Son Preference' report.
"Men who experience economic stress were more likely to have perpetrated violence ever or in the past 12 months. This may be because of norms related to masculinity, which reinforce the expectation that men are primary economic providers for their households."
The study - across the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra - found that men who had experienced discrimination as children were four times more likely to be violent towards their partners.
The highest reports of violence came from Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, said the report, with more than 70% of men in these regions admitting to being abusive towards their wives and partners.
More than 38% of all crimes committed against women in India in 2013 were those registered under the charge of cruelty by husband or his relatives, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).
Such crimes make up the largest proportion of crimes against women in the country - with 118,866 cases of cruelty by husband or his family reported from a total of 309,546, says the NCRB.
Physical violence most common
The study, which also polled 3,158 women, said more than half (52%) of women said they had experienced some form of violence during their lifetime.
Physical abuse such as being kicked, slapped, choked and burned was the most commonly reported, with 38% of women saying they had faced such abuse. This was followed by emotional, sexual and economic violence respectively.
The reason less women reported being victims than men  reported being violent was a feeling of shame or fear of social stigma, said the report. They may have also believed such acts were normal in a relationship and expected men to exert some control on their lives, it added.
Women who were discriminated against as children were three to six times more likely to experience violence.
"Women who experienced and observed discrimination or violence growing up are more likely to justify it as adults and may therefore not resist circumstances that may trigger intimate partner violence," the report said.
The head of UNFPA in India, Frederika Meijer, said that this research into the causes of violence would help to structure programmes to engage men and boys more effectively.
"It identifies triggers that could enable them to become change agents in addressing gender discrimination," Meijer said at the launch of the report on the sidelines of the MenEngage conference aimed at getting men involved in gender equality.

Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri said, markets should not panic over the recent plunge of oil prices because the situation will resolve itself,  said on Monday.
"Please do not panic, things will fix(ed) itself," Badri said during a panel discussion at a major energy industry conference in Abu Dhabi.
United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, who was also on the panel, delivered a similar opinion, saying, "We are not seeing the price issue as a major issue that we need to panic about."
Badri indicated that both producers and consumers would be happy with oil prices in a broad range around US $100 per barrel.
"In the last five to six years we don't see any nagging by consumers or producers... $100, $110, $95, they are happy with these prices," Badri said.
The OPEC Secretary-General also said, "A high price is not preferable by OPEC, a low price is not preferable by OPEC" because high prices would mean less demand while low prices would reduce investment in oil supply.
Meanwhile, the basket of 12 crude oils of the OPEC closed at US $78.67 a barrel on Friday compared to $78.27 last Thursday (Oct 30), the OPEC Secretariat said.

More govt support needed for investment abroad: MittalMore govt support needed for investment abroad, says Sunil Mittal

Making a strong pitch for economic diplomacy, Sunil Bharti Mittal, founder and chairman of Bharti Enterprises on Monday called for much greater government support for extending Indian enterprise abroad.
"We don't have the massive state support required to push the soft power of Indian enterprise, as companies get in the US, UK, France, Germany," Sunil Bharti Mittal , said at the India Global Forum in New Delhi hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
The owner of Airtel Africa that operates in 17 countries, Mittal said lack of adequate government support becomes an additional hurdle in a context like in the continent where it is impossible to match the money power of Chinese state companies.
"We cannot match the amount of money the Chinese are putting in Africa. The good news is we have tremendous amount of goodwill, our relations have developed for over a century. Any leader of any standing in Ethiopia has been taught by Indian teachers," he said.
From Africa, Mittal gave the recent example of corporate action abroad "as an important arm of the government to do things they cannot do" like in controlling the Ebola epidemic in the continent.
"The government leans on us for the efforts on Ebola control in 3-4 countries. We went in quickly into Sierra Leone, where we operate, and then into Liberia and later to Nigeria, Ghana and DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo)," Mittal added.
Bharti Airtel has also agreed to join a pan-African mobile telephone fundraising campaign that would allow 700 million subscribers to make donations with their mobile devices to Ebola control.
Citing the instance of Bangladesh where issues like Teesta river waters-sharing also affected business relations, Mittal said: "Businesses are affected to a large extent by the relations between states. Yet we don't have the full extent of state support."

Legal battle involving Rolling Stones reaches Utah... 
November 10, 2014 07:09 AM EST | Associated Press
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Insurance underwriters involved in a legal battle with the Rolling Stones over a $12.7 million claim have won permission to seek evidence in Utah about the mental health of Mick Jagger's girlfriend before she took her life in March.
A federal judge in Utah last month allowed the 12 underwriters to gather testimony and documents from Randall Bambrough of Ogden, the brother of L'Wren Scott.
She was a fashion designer and Utah native whose suicide prompted the rock group to postpone a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand and then file a $12.7 claim for losses due to its postponement.
Jagger was "diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder" after Scott's death and was advised by doctors not to perform for at least 30 days, according to documents filed in the court case in Utah.
Before the tour, the group took out a $23.9 million policy to be paid in the event shows were canceled due to the death of family members or others, including Scott.
In denying the claim, underwriters said Scott might have been suffering from a pre-existing mental illness and her death might not be covered under the policy.
Underwriters are seeking information from Bambrough about possible illnesses, treatments and the circumstances of her death, The Salt Lake Tribune reported (http://bit.ly/1ozCklv ).
Bambrough said Thursday he did not know about the federal court case naming him and had not received a subpoena to provide testimony and documents about his sister. He declined further comment.
The Rolling Stones' Los Angeles public relations firm and the underwriters' Utah attorney did not respond to emails seeking comment.
After underwriters denied the claim, the Stones sued them in London.
The same underwriters petitioned federal court in New York seeking similar information from Scott's former personal assistant, Brittany Penebre, and from the executor of Scott's estate, Adam Glassman.
Scott was adopted by Mormon parents and raised in Roy, Utah, which had a population of less than 10,000 at the time. She left home as a teenager to become a model in Paris, then a top Hollywood stylist and finally a high-end fashion designer best known as the girlfriend of Jagger.
Scott, whose elegant designs in lush fabrics were favored by celebrities like Madonna, Nicole Kidman, Oprah Winfrey, Penelope Cruz and first lady Michelle Obama, was a fixture on Jagger's arm since she met the Stones frontman in 2001. On red carpets, the striking 6-foot-3 designer towered over her famous 5-foot-10 boyfriend.
An autopsy completed on the body of 49-year-old Scott found she died of hanging in her New York City apartment.
The underwriters filed a petition in federal court in Utah on Oct. 10, and U.S. Magistrate Judge Brooke Wells granted their request a week later to gather evidence from her brother, The Tribune reported.

Dendreon files for Ch 11 bankruptcy reorganization...and
versions
The prostate cancer drug developer Dendreon is seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and has reached a financial restructuring agreement with investors holding more than $520 million in debt.
The Seattle company listed more than $664 million in total debts and $364.6 million in assets in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing on Monday. Its largest creditor is Bank of New York Mellon, which holds $620 million in notes.
Dendreon Corp. makes the prostate cancer treatment Provenge. It said Monday that its reorganization allows for the continued delivery of the drug to doctors and patients. The drugmaker also said it has enough cash to support all operations during its restructuring.
The company will attempt to sell itself to a buyer that would continue to produce Provenge, or, if it receives no qualifying bids, continue as a stand-alone company.
Dendreon warned shareholders in August about its debt load and said then that it that it was considering alternatives that could wipe out their ownership. The company said then that there was a "significant risk" that it would not be able to repay or refinance $620 million in notes due in 2016.
The company said Monday that its reorganization plan involves converting all 2016 notes into equity of the reorganized company.
Dendreon launched Provenge, its first commercial product approved by the Food and Drug Administration, in 2010. The drug trains a patient's immune system to fight cancer. Analysts initially expected sales to reach into the billions of dollars. However, the drug's performance has been hurt in part by its cost, limited benefit and reimbursement rates.
The drugmaker changed leadership last summer when it named former Discovery Labs leader W. Thomas Amick president and chief executive officer. The company had said in June that former CEO John H. Johnson planned to resign for personal reasons.
Shares of Dendreon, which is based in Seattle, shed most of their value Monday before markets opened, sinking 59 cents to 35 cents. The stock had slipped below $1 earlier this fall and has tumbled most of this year after closing 2013 at $2.99.

Tips to give your house modest yet stylish lookDeck up your Den
PRIORITISE FUNCTION OVER STYLE
To lend your den a minimalist and stylish look, focus on essential functional elements such as a full-length mirror or a sleek chest of drawers. Natural earth tones as well as combinations of white, black, grey, cream and cool blue work best for walls. Team them with curtains and bedspreads in neutral shades. Stick to wood for furniture as it creates a rugged-yet-warm look.
KEEP IT CLASSIC
Fibreglass and wicker are catching on, but nothing spells class like good ol' teak or redwood. Invest in Chippendale sofas, which look effortlessly elegant. Bulky pieces are best avoided unless you have a lot of space. Limit wall decor to paintings or framed photos. Ceramic or wrought-iron lamps are a good option.
FREE UP SPACE
Instead of filling your rooms with furniture that create the illusion of space, position the pieces to create mini-rooms within your apartment. This neatly compartmentalises the flow of space. With small shelves flanking a hanging TV and a low table underneath for movies and books, you can create a lounge-y atmosphere with two recliners and a couch. Make sure the entertainment system is not too far from the kitchen, where you can incorporate a snack centre and a built-in countertop.
COLOUR COORDINATE
For the bathroom, opt for brick or stone finish tiles. For a more rugged look, design the bathroom in harmony with the connecting room. Stick to stainless steel for a snazzy-looking sink.
INVEST IN MUST-HAVES
No luxurious man cave is complete without a sofa made of genuine leather, a movie theatre with a stereo system, a mini sports bar and an elaborate writing desk.

Theft Home Improvement The Home Depot NYSE Euronext, Inc. Target Brands, Inc.
Home Depot Inc, the world's largest home improvement chain, said hackers stole about 53 million email addresses in addition to customer data for 56 million payment cards previously disclosed by the retailer.
The company, which confirmed the breach in September, said the files that contained the email addresses did not include passwords, payment card information or other sensitive personal information.
Home Depot, which had estimated that the theft would cost about $62 million, was one of a string of U.S. retailers attacked by hackers over the past year.
Read the story
Criminals used a third-party vendor's user name and password to enter the perimeter of its network, Home Depot said in a statement on Thursday.
The hackers then acquired "elevated rights" that allowed them to navigate parts of Home Depot's network and to deploy unique, custom-built malware on its self-checkout systems in the U.S. and Canada, according to the company.
Home Depot said the stolen credentials did not alone provide direct access to the company's point-of-sale devices.

Since September, the company has implemented enhanced encryption of payment data in all U.S. stores and said the rollout to Canadian stores will be completed by early 2015.
This, however, was "really lipstick on a pig" and the proper solution was to add chip and PIN, or EMV technology, to U.S. credit cards, said David Campbell, chief security officer at SendGrid, a cloud-based email delivery service.
Home Depot said it was already rolling out the EMV technology.
The company reaffirmed its 2014 sales growth forecast of about 4.8 percent and earnings per share forecast of $4.54.
The forecast includes estimates for the cost to investigate the data breach, provide credit monitoring services to its customers as well as legal fees, the company said.
"I think the big takeaway was that they are able to maintain their sales guidance for the full year, which means people are still showing up at the stores, still spending.." Joseph Feldman, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, told Reuters.
The company maintained that it has not yet estimated the impact of "probable losses" related to the breach.
"Those costs may have a material adverse effect on The Home Depot's financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and/or future periods," the company said.
Home Depot shares closed up 1.6 percent at $97.29 per share on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Target Corp's unprecedented breach saw hackers steal at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data in 2013.

Balaji Wafers aims at pan-India presenceStory
Snacking its way to success
Balaji Wafers is looking to become a pan-India brand, and that's where the challenge could be.

CATEGORY: Best Emerging Company (Large Companies)
Lunch time for the Viranis, founders of the Rs 1,000-crore Balaji Wafers, is sacrosanct. The three founders, Bhikubhai, Chandubhai and Kanubha, along with their sons Mihir, Pranay and Keyur, respectively, get together over homecooked Gujarati meal every afternoon at their corporate office on the outskirts of Rajkot. Often, the sons seek business advice from the elders. The goal of the younger Viranis, says Keyur, is to make Balaji a national brand. "We are net savvy and are more in touch with consumer preferences and production best practices," he says. "Our endeavour is to be as contemporary as possible but not at the expense of diluting the brand value that our parents have created."
The second generation of the Virani family is clearly beginning to take centre stage. The foray into healthier snacks is the brainchild of the younger Viranis. The company recently invested about Rs 250 crore in setting up new machinery at its 85,000 sq. metre fully automated factory on the outskirts of Rajkot, where it would make a range of baked, multigrain snacks that are perceived to be healthier than traditional fried snacks. It has also acquired land near Indore to set up its third factory, which would be operational in 2016. With this, the company would be spreading its wings to northern India, from its traditional foothold of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
The younger Viranis are aware a bet on healthier snacks by bigger companies - PepsiCo's Aliva and Parle Product 's Smart Chip, for instance - failed to lure customers. Keyur, who looks after research and development, says the R&D team is trying to come up with a product that is tasty as well as healthy. Pranay, who takes care of business development, says Balaji is reducing oil consumption even in its traditional offerings such as potato wafers and namkeen. "But the value addition is only up to the level where the taste doesn't get compromised," he says.

The second generation also feels the need to get some strategic investment into the business in order to take it to the next level. The Rs 1,000-crore company was in advanced talks with PepsiCo and Kellogg's last year, but both deals fell through. "Our idea of strategic partnership was to get access to global best practices... but all of them wanted a majority stake in the business which we were not ready to part with," says Keyur. The company has also been evaluating private equity deals. However, Managing Director Chandubhai isn't keen on roping in strategic investors. He says strategic partners would only want profits. "They will never grow the business with the same passion as we have done," he says.
The company has more than 70 per cent market share in Gujarat and over 60 per cent in Maharashtra
Despite its lofty ambitions, Balaji Wafers remains regional in its thinking. For instance, it doesn't believe in spending much on marketing and advertising. While PepsiCo spends seven to eight per cent of its snack revenue (around Rs 6,000 crore) on advertising and hires Bollywood superstars such as Ranbir Kapoor to endorse its brands, Balaji's ad and marketing spends are negligible. Chandubhai's mantra for growth is to pump in as much muscle into distribution - the company has a network of 600 dealers in Gujarat and Maharashtra. He feels that marketing is all about understanding consumer needs and offering great products. This strategy has certainly worked. It not only has more than 70 per cent market share in Gujarat, but has also managed to displace PepsiCo's Lays in Maharashtra from leadership position in the last five years since it has entered the market, according to industry estimates. Balaji Wafers has over 60 per cent market share in potato chips in the state.
Snack time: Keyur Virani at the Balaji Wafers factory
The biggest positive rub-off of having a distribution-only model is the company's ability to offer more at the same price. While a Rs 10 pack of Lays or Bingo has around 13 grams of chips in it, a Rs 10 pack of Balaji contains 20 grams chips. However, Keyur says they may be soon forced to cut down on grammage as potato prices rise.
The company is also increasing its dependence on snacks. The contribution of wafers has come down from 70 per cent to 40 per cent. "Snacks gets us higher margins than wafers, so we are trying to balance our portfolio," says Pranay. Increasing focus on snacks is, indeed, a logical step forward, points out U. Krishna Rao, the head of the snacks business at Parle Products. Rao says that in the Rs 9,000-crore snack business, the growth of potato chips has decreased to single digits while the namkeen segment is growing 20 per cent annually. "The erratic potato pricing as well as consumers not wanting to consume too much potato wafers has affected sales," says Rao.
The company is also not too open about hiring professionals. Apart from the head of production, Nishikant Bapat (formerly with PepsiCo) and the R&D head, all the other employees holding managerial roles have been groomed by Chandubhai. "Professionals don't stick on for long, all the people I have personally groomed are still there with me," he says.
The Virani family's traditional mindset has definitely worked so far. But will this mindset work when the company is at the cusp of taking a leap to the next phase of growth? Its biggest challenge would be attracting professionals as grooming local talent in a new market would, indeed, be tough, says a senior partner in a leading consulting company.
From a brand valuation perspective, Raghu Vishwanath, Managing Director of brand valuation company Vertebrand, says Balaji may not get incremental valuation as its mindshare has not kept pace with the market share. "Brand valuation is a combination of mindshare and market share. In Balaji's case, the mindshare is negligible. Nobody knows about Balaji outside of Gujarat and Maharashtra," he says. "Regional brands such as MTR could take it up to a point till they sold out. Balaji has to invest in brand-building to survive in the long run."
The company also has to deal with the challenge of coming up with snacks tailor-made for local tastes. Ganthia, a snack which sells like hot cakes in Gujarat, may not necessarily work in UP. The younger Viranis claim that they are fully prepared for the challenge.
Despite being a competitor, Rao of Parle Products is confident that the Viranis will be able to establish themselves in the new markets. "They completely cornered the market leader in Maharashtra when they came in five years ago and became a leader with huge shares. Balaji's entry into North is surely an alarm bell for the larger snack companies."

Jaitley vows to push land purchase reformNew Delhi, November 9, 2014

Jaitley vows to push land purchase reform

economy, business and finance
India will push ahead with reform to a land purchase law blamed by business for slowing industrial projects, even if there is resistance to loosening the rules, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Sunday.
Mr. Jaitley said changes to the law were needed to fulfil Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of building 100 new "smart" cities across India.
"Some changes will be necessary, we will first attempt to reach a consensus, if that's not possible we will go ahead and take the decision," Jaitley said, speaking at a seminar in New Delhi.
The law was passed last year with support of BJP when it was in opposition, and seeks to set fair compensation for loss of livelihood for farmers who sell their land to industrial or infrastructure projects.
But its complex procedures have made it very hard for large-scale industrial projects to acquire the land they need.
The BJP would need parliamentary approval to change the law, and might struggle in the upper house where it does not have a majority.
Mr. Jaitley also said he hoped to begin a delayed programme to sell stakes in government owned companies "in the next couple of days". He said the government was aiming to bring down its equity in public sector banks to about 52 per cent.
Hopeful of passage of Insurance Bill in Winter session
Mr. Jaitley expressed hope that the long-pending Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, which seeks to raise the FDI cap in the sector to 49 per cent, will get the Parliament approval in the upcoming Winter Session.
“We have opened up investments in various sectors. I do hope this (Winter) session I will be able to pass the Insurance Bill,” he said at the India Global Forum meeting here.
The month-long Winter Session of Parliament is scheduled to commence from November 24.
FDI in the sector is capped at 26 per cent at present.
The much-delayed Insurance Bill has been referred to the Select Committee of Parliament. The Bill, which comes with a rider that the management control would rest in the hands of Indian promoter, has been pending since 2008 in the Rajya Sabha.
The Minister said India is pursuing the policy of allowing foreign investment with sectoral cap keeping in mind the requirements of the economy and the appetite of the Indian political system.
“When we were in the government last time we opened up the sector. At that time, the political system had an appetite for a limited opening. We are now opening up the sector a little more,” he added.
Bowing to opposition pressure, the government had in August agreed to refer the Insurance Bill to the 15-member Select Committee. The committee is expected to submit its report by the third week of November.
The reform, according to experts, could increase the flow of foreign investment to the tune of Rs 25,000 crore into the private insurance companies. The move would help insurance firms to get the much-needed capital from overseas partners.
There are about two dozen private sector insurance firms, both in life and non-life segment in the country.
Govt in final stages of discussions with states on GST
Hinting that amendments to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) may be introduced in the ensuing Winter session of Parliament, Mr. Jaitley said the government was in the final stages of talks with states on the issue.
“I am in the last stage of my discussion with the states on the eve of Parliament session before introducing the amendments to the GST law in Parliament,” Jaitley said at the India Global Forum meeting here.
The month-long Winter Session of Parliament is scheduled to commence on November 24.
Seeking support from the opposition parties, especially Congress, in passing the key legislation, Mr. Jaitley said they should realise that the “merits of some of these actions have positive attitude towards them“.
“I do hope that my friends in the Opposition parties, particularly the principle Opposition, after a wasted opportunity when they were in government, spend a more fruitful tenure when they are in opposition,” Mr. Jaitley said.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime aims at subsuming most of the indirect taxes at the central as well as state level. The UPA government in 2011 introduced a Constitution Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha to pave the way for introduction of GST.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.
Pending since 2006, the discussion on GST Bill is stuck at a crucial stage where states have proposed to keep products such as petroleum, tobacco and alcohol out of GST ambit and had demanded the exemption list be included in the Constitutional Amendment Bill.

Alaska Election ResultsHere are seven questions and answers about why patience is a virtue when it comes to the Last Frontier:
Isn’t the election over?
Yes, the election was Tuesday, but we may not have an answer to the questions of who is the new Senator and Governor from the Last Frontier for weeks because there are still votes to be counted and that won’t start until next week. According to Gail Fenumiai, the director of the Alaska Division of Elections, there are 23,271 early and absentee ballots deemed eligible for counting. These are already received and reviewed as eligible. They sent out another 12,541 absentee ballots and if postmarked by November 4th, ballots can arrive legally 15 days after the election and still be properly counted. Of course, they have no idea how many of those will be returned.
How long is this going to take?
We don’t know exactly, but here’s what we can tell you: There are also an unknown amount of provisional ballots, which are ballots that may have been cast at an incorrect polling location or if a poll monitor couldn’t find a voter’s name, amongst other possible irregularities. In 2010, there were about 13,000, but they have no idea if the number will be the same. The ballots are currently being reviewed for eligibility. There are also an additional 2,651 statewide early votes that remain to be counted. On top of those votes, there are absentee ballots coming in daily from Alaska’s over 200 in-person voting locations. Some that arrived before Election Day have been counted, but none of the ballots coming in from as many as 120 rural communities have been tabulated yet. The number of those are completely unknown. In addition to these ballots there are about 2,000 urban early votes that have yet to be counted. They will be counted on November 11th, 14th, and then from the 17th through the 19th if necessary. Remember in Alaska, absentees are sent in from remote locales so these races may not be called for quite a while.
Just how remote are we talking?
Alaska’s biggest city is Anchorage, but the state is dotted with tiny, rural communities, some accessible not by roads, but only by boat or plane. Democratic Sen. Mark Begich made a strong push for these voters sending local campaign staffers to these villages called the Alaskan bush to register voters along with materials in native languages. He even set up campaign offices in some small communities, but Begich’s GOP challenger Dan Sullivan’s wife is the daughter of native Alaskan leaders and he frequently spoke about that heritage on the campaign trail. As in all states, absentee ballots can be mailed in from all over, but unlike other states in Alaska they may come from voters in far flung locales like a commercial salmon fishermen or oil rig workers on the North Slope. In a statement, Begich campaign manager Susanne Fleek-Green noted the outstanding ballots and difficulty some went through to vote saying they were, “inspired by stories of village elders being lifted onto four wheelers to go vote and Alaskans traveling up and down river to cast their ballots.” Get Out the Native Vote, a group working to increase voting access to native Alaskans, released a statement saying “the election isn’t over until ‘rural Alaska sings.’” And this time it certainly looks to be true.

So, where does the vote count in Alaska stand now?
In the Alaska Senate race, with 100% of precincts reporting, Sullivan has 49% to Begich’s 45.3% of the vote. Sullivan leads Begich by 8,149 votes. In the Alaska Gubernatorial race, with 100% of precincts reporting, independent challenger Bill Walker has 48% to incumbent GOP Gov. Sean Parnell’s 46.6% of the vote. Walker, the independent gubernatorial candidate running with a Democratic lieutenant governor to form a “unity ticket,” leads Parnell by 3,165 votes.
But, someone will concede soon, right?
It doesn’t look like it. In neither race are the trailing candidates, Begich or Parnell conceding any time soon.
In statements, Begich campaign manager Susanne Fleek-Green said they were “anxious for a final count” and they respect the “procedures, process and timetable of the Alaska Division of Elections.” She said Begich would make a statement on the race only after “counts arrive from the seventy outstanding villages and when the number of outstanding absentee and questioned ballots is clear.” But, for Sullivan, he posted a statement on his Facebook page as if the election was over writing, “Now, the real work begins. We’re going to get our country back on track and empower Alaskan families and communities to decide their own destiny.” His campaign told ABC News Sullivan is leaving today for Marine Corps Reserve training.
And what about Parnell?
Parnell is also standing firm saying in a statement, “with the governor’s race still dependent on more than 30,000 absentee and questioned votes left to count, this is an extremely tight race. We will make sure every Alaskan’s vote gets counted and we remain confident that the lead can switch with the number of ballots remaining.” Walker announced they will send observers for next week’s ballot counting. In a statement, Walker said, “this race is not yet over, but we remain optimistic that we will maintain our lead as absentee votes are counted in regional centers,” noting they hope to have “more definitive news by next week.” He added that since inauguration is December 1st, despite not being officially elected he has already met with campaign advisors to “review a possible transition timeline that could begin once all the ballots are counted.”
Do Begich or Parnell have a chance?
Stranger things have happened in Alaska, but Sullivan’s lead is hard to overcome. In 2008, the race between then then-Anchorage mayor Mark Begich and longtime GOP Sen. Ted Stevens went on for over two weeks. On election night Begich trailed Stevens by over 3,000 votes out of over 221,000 cast, but ended up winning by about 4,000 votes, an increase of about 2.7 percent. The reason why there’s incentive for both sides not to give in until they have to.

Too early to rejoice over falling inflation:KhanFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Amid a rising clamour for a rate cut, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cautioned markets against an ‘early celebration’ over a falling inflation and said there are still inflationary pressures in the economy.
“There are structural issues regarding protein inflation and base effects, and rural areas are also seeing inflation,” RBI deputy governor HR Khan said on Friday. He said the battle against inflation has a long way to go as input costs and wages remain elevated. Equity and bond markets are already pricing in an early rate cut, with the benchmark Sensex hitting an all-time high of 28,010.4 and bond yields touching a 15-month low of 8.19%.
Earlier this week, at an economic summit, Indian corporates called for a rate cut and finance minister Arun Jaitley also backed such a move, citing the recent fall in retail inflation.
Retail inflation eased to 6.46% in September, led by a drop in food and fuel prices. The RBI has said that it aims to bring down inflation to 8% by January 2015 and to 6% by January 2016. The RBI will release its bi-monthly policy on December 2.
Inflation is likely to ease further due to the drop in global crude oil prices besides easing domestic food prices. However, Khan downplayed the recent sharp fall in commodity prices and said that although this is a boon for India, there are geopolitical risks lurking. “But one cannot be sure…people say this is the bottom, but I don’t know. There are risks like a collapse in (oil-producing) countries like Libya, geopolitical tensions or (drop in) US production,” he said.
Brent crude has fallen nearly $20 per barrel over the last two months. The soft oil prices, along with a stable currency, augurs well for domestic inflation as well as the current account deficit position.
Khan said while an improvement in sentiment is good for the economy, a pick-up in growth is yet to show in hard data. “Growth sentiments are good, the savings investment equilibrium is improving. But capex cycle is yet to pick up, investments are yet to pick up, and exports are showing an up and down trend because of global growth,” he said.
RBI to impound Rs 10,000 cr from banks via cash management bills
After a gap of a year, RBI will impound Rs 10,000 crore from the banking system through cash management bills. RBI in a notice on Friday said it would auction 42-day cash management bills on Monday. The move comes at a time when the banking sector has moved to a neutral liquidity position from a deficit.
Borrowings from the daily repo window have fallen and rates on money market instruments like certificates of deposit and commercial papers have eased around 20 basis points.

New norms may put onus on insiders to proveinnocenceFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will soon finalise rules pertaining to insider trading as also improvise delisting norms. This comes close on the heels of the regulator introducing guidelines on investment trusts for real estate and infrastructure sectors, and improving the framework of equity capital markets.
The new rules may be announced at Sebi’s board meeting on Nov 19 in Mumbai, people familiar with the matter told FE.
In December last year, Sebi chairman UK Sinha had suggested an overhaul in the governance of insider trading by recommending a wider definition of parties considered as ‘insiders’ and putting the onus on insiders to prove they have not breached the law. The recommendations were a part of the draft report formulated by a 15-member high-level committee constituted by Sebi to replace the 22-year-old rule in this area. The committee was headed by NK Sodhi, former Chief Justice of Karnataka and Kerala High Courts as well as former presiding officer of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT).
The panel had emphasised the definition of ‘insider’ and recommended that ‘connected persons’, or any individual in possession of unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI), be considered an ‘insider’. The panel had described a ‘connected person’ as an individual in possession of UPSI and associated with the concerned trade at the time or during the six months prior to the occurrence of the concerned trade, in any capacity. The proposed revision in norms assumes significance in the wake of Sebi receiving complaints of insider trading in not just small companies, but also big corporates.
“We are revising our prevention of insider-trading regulations because we have discovered cases… unfortunately, the cases are not just from small companies, but also from big ones,” Sinha was quoted as saying at a recent capital market conference.
Sebi had also recommended bringing public servants, including Sebi officials, under the purview of insider-trading rules. The rationale was that government officials have access to insider or price-sensitive information. Other recommendations included increasing trades disclosure threshold to R10 lakh or more in a quarter from R5 lakh, and also outlawing “communication of UPSI by any insider except where such communication is legitimately necessary for performance of duties or discharge of legal obligations”.

Laxmikant Parsekar sworn in as Goa Chief MinisterEYE BROWSE
Laxmikant Parsekar sworn in as Goa Chief Minister
His name was formally proposed by outgoing chief minister Manohar Parrikar and seconded by Deputy Chief Minister Francis D'Souza.
IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News –  Sat 8 Nov, 2014

Panaji: Goa Health Minister Laxmikant Parsekar Saturday took oath as chief minister to succeed Manohar Parrikar who is becoming a union minister.
Parsekar took the oath of office and secrecy soon after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) succeeded in persuading Deputy Chief Minister Francis D'Souza to accept his leadership.
And so, while Parsekar's name was formally proposed by Parrikar, D'Souza seconded it at a meeting of party legislators. D'Souza had earlier said he would not serve in the government under anyone else including Parsekar.
Parsekar will be Goa's 11th chief minister.
Parrikar resigned from office after his elevation to the union cabinet, possibly as defence minister.
Parsekar's candidature has also been endorsed by the highest decision-making body of the BJP, the parliamentary board, sources said.
Parrikar resigns as CM
A day ahead of being sworn in as union minister, possibly in charge of the defence ministry, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar Saturday resigned from office.
Parrikar faxed his resignation to Governor Mridula Sinha. His successor is expected to be appointed at 4 p.m.
Earlier, Parrikar met Goa Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao and explained to him the reason for his departure from state politics.
Parrikar, during his third tenure as chief minister from 2012, had a good relationship with the influential Roman Catholic Church in Goa which subtly backed the Bharatiya Janata Party during the last assembly polls.
Parrikar Friday told reporters that he had been formally invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to join his central cabinet and he had decided to accept the offer as a matter of "national interest" although he also said that he was extremely attached to Goa.
The outgoing Goa chief minister will be sworn in as union minister Sunday and is likely to be offered the defence portfolio.
On Monday, he is expected to fly to Lucknow where he will file his nomination papers to book a passage to parliament through the Rajya Sabha.

We play with fire if we skimp on healthNovember 9, 2014 2:15 pm
We play with fire if we skimp on public health
Lawrence Summers
Ebola was a ‘stress test’ on health systems, and Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea could not cope
©AP
Epidemics and pandemics are like earthquakes. Tragic, inevitable and unpredictable. It starts as a random event. A virus jumps species from a bird, bat, or other animal to “Patient Zero” – who passes it on to other human beings. More likely than not, over the course of this century we will face an influenza pandemic similar to the one in 1918 that killed 50m people.
The FT’s A-List
The A-List provides timely, insightful comment on the topics that matter, from globally renowned leaders, policy makers and commentators
President Barack Obama’s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, said in the wake of the global economic meltdown that “you never let a serious crisis go to waste”. Crises are opportunities to learn. They point to measures that will prevent the collapse of institutions when they are under extreme pressure.
While the focus is understandably on responding to the Ebola crisis, it is equally important that it serves as a wake-up call with respect to inadequacies that threaten not just tragedy on an unprecedented scale but the basic security of the US and other wealthy nations. As with climate change, no part of the world can insulate itself from the consequences of epidemic and pandemic.
The report of the Global Health 2035 commission, which I co-chaired, points up three crucial lessons. First, collective action must be taken to build strong health systems in every corner of the globe. In west Africa, Ebola was a “stress test” on national health systems, and in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea the systems could not cope. There were too few trained health professionals; there was also too little equipment and too few supplies, and too little capacity for public health surveillance and control.
More
Reform as the answer
Nigeria’s containment of the virus after the first case was diagnosed in July is instructive. Its success, hailed by the World Health Organisation as a piece of “world class epidemiological detective work”, is explained by its aggressive, co-ordinated surveillance and control response. It already had a polio surveillance system, with skilled outbreak specialists who were quickly put to work tackling Ebola. While much of Nigeria’s health system, such as primary care services, remains very weak, on Ebola the surveillance and control system worked. Every country needs this kind of system. Prevention is cheaper than cure and leads to better outcomes.
Building these systems takes time and money. Our research, conducted with an international team of economists and health experts, and published last year in the medical journal The Lancet, suggests that the price of this “systems strengthening” would be about $30bn a year for the next two decades. The good news is that we have the financing to pay for this through a combination of aid and domestic spending. The cost represents well under 1 per cent of the additional gross domestic product that will be available to low- and lower-middle-income countries due to increased GDP growth over the next 20 years.
The second lesson is that the lack of investment in public health is a global emergency. The WHO’s slow response to Ebola was not surprising, given its recent staff cuts. For that, we all share the blame. Since 1994, the WHO’s regular budget has declined steadily in real terms. Even before the Ebola crisis, it struggled to fund basic functions. The entire budget for influenza was just $7·7m in 2013 – less than a third of what New York City alone devotes to preparing for public health emergencies.
It takes just one infected airline passenger to introduce an infection into a country. We need the WHO more than ever. It alone has the mandate and legitimacy to serve as a health protection agency for all countries, rich and poor. Starving it of funds is reckless.
The third lesson concerns scientific innovation. When it comes to discovering and developing medicines, vaccines and diagnostic tests, we have been largely ignoring the infectious diseases that disproportionately kill the world’s poor. Consequently, we still have no medicines or vaccine for Ebola. All we can do is provide basic life support, such as fluids and blood pressure treatment. For prevention, we have to rely on old-fashioned measures such as quarantine.
Margaret Chan, the WHO’s director-general, has explained the reason for this neglect. Doctors were “empty-handed”, she said, because “a profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay”. Ebola affects poor African nations, so drug companies see no profit in working on it. Nor is there an adequate incentive to invest in prevention. No society will allow companies to reap huge profits when disease is spreading rapidly.
Rich governments and donors need to step up. Investing several billion dollars a year, less than 0.01 per cent of global GDP, could be decisive in preventing tragedy on the scale of world war.
Some issues are even more important than recessions and elections. Ebola is a tragedy. Let us hope that it will also be a spur to taking the necessary steps to prevent the far greater one that is nearly inevitable on the current policy trajectory. The next Ebola is just around the corner.

AAI  Pawan Hans to be listed on stock exchanges; Air India privatisation not now: GovtEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Terming UPA’s aviation policy as “opaque”, government today brought in a fresh draft recommending listing of state-run Airports Authority of India and chopper firm Pawan Hans on stock exchanges and steps to beef up Air India operations, hinting at its stake sale too.
Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju unveiled the draft civil aviation policy which also proposes to enhance regional air connectivity, develop six major metro airports as international hubs, create more airports through PPP mode, rationalise jet fuel cost, promote air cargo, MRO and helicopter operations and improve passenger facilitation.
The rule, which allows an Indian airline to fly abroad only after they have flown domestic for five years and have a 20-aircraft fleet, would also be reviewed, he said.
The draft would now be open for wider consultation with all stakeholders, with the Minister saying he hoped to finalise and implement it by January next year.
“If a policy existed (during UPA rule), it was opaque. We want to develop a transparent policy because opaqueness leads itself to allegations. This government wants to work in a transparent manner,” Raju said in response to questions.
On the proposal to list mini ratna AAI and Pawan Hans Helicopters Limited (PHHL) on stock exchanges to “improve transparency and efficiency”, he said, “AAI will be corporatised, followed by listing in the stock exchanges in order to improve efficiency and transparency. Listing of PHHL would also be undertaken with the same objective.”
“PHHL’s listing straightaway might make sense. For AAI also, that is possible,” the Minister said.
A senior official later said no time frame has yet been fixed for by when the two entities would be listed or what percentage of government holding would be divested in them.
Regarding privatisation of Air India, he said this was a suggestion made by “certain sections. While some say privatisation is a solution, others say it should remain with the public sector. Another section says the airline should be managed professionally by professional bodies.”
“Why should we close our options? Let us take a conscious decision,” he said.
Asked whether Air India could also be listed in the stock market like AAI and PHHL, the Minister said, “If it could get listed, I would be the happiest person”.
Observing that an “in-house” Experts Committee would be set up soon to develop “a future roadmap” for Air India, he said,
“It is in the country’s interest that it cruises smoothly. All these suggestions have emerged. We don’t want to open a pandora’s box. We will have to take a conscious decision as it is a delicate matter.”
Later, the Civil Aviation Ministry official, who did not wish to be named, said any decision on stake sale or professional management would be taken only after the experts group gives its recommendations and then “we will see what is the best alternative or the best way forward.”
On AAI and PHHL, he said it would be easier to list PHHL because it is already a registered company.
“It could take up to six months for listing PHHL. We will work with the Department of Disinvestment, as it is the nodal Ministry for divesting stake in PSUs. Mopping up funds is not the prime objective of the exercise in both the entities. It will also help bring about greater professionalism in the boards of the two entities,” the official said.
To questions on whether the rule of five years of domestic flying and 20-plane fleet to allow Indian carriers to fly abroad would be scrapped, the Minister indicated doing away with it, saying rules which check the growth of aviation would go. “To my mind, it doesn’t make sense … we may throw the bathwater and keep the baby”.
On high taxes on jet fuel, Raju said the Centre has been requesting states to lower the taxes as fuel costs are close to 40-45 per cent of an airline’s total operational cost.
“When global petroleum prices are coming down, we will try to get a strategy in place to pass on that benefit,” he said.

Coal scam: CBI says enough evidence in case involving KM Birla  PC ParakhCBI
(Earlier, on October 21,…)
NEW DELHI: A Supreme Court-appointed Special Public Prosecutor and lawyers representing the CBI told a court on Monday there was enough evidence to take cognisance of offences against the accused in a coal scam case involving industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla and former coal secretary PC Parakh. These developments represent a major twist in the tale in the high-profile case as the CBI had submitted a closure report saying there was no evidence to file charges against any person.
CBI had filed a first information report (FIR) against Hindalco, its owner Kumar Mangalam Birla and former coal secretary PC Parakh in October last year for alleged irregularities in a coal block allocation to the company.
The FIR had led to uproar. While business leaders denounced the CBI action against Birla, many retired civil servants, including former chief auditor Vinod Rai, spoke out in defence of Parakh, asserting that the former coal secretary was known for his integrity.
A few months ago, CBI had filed a closure report saying there was nothing wrong in the allocation and no charges were made out. On October 21, the CBI submitted a revised and comprehensive closure report after the trial court pointed to gaps in the first closure report.
However, on Monday, the SC-appointed Special Public Prosecutor for coal scam cases, RS Cheema told the trail court that there was "prima facie enough material" to proceed against some private parties and public servants in this coal blocks allocation scam case.
"Arguments heard. Special Public Prosecutor states that from the over all facts and circumstances, there is prima facie enough material on record to take cognizance of various offences under Prevention of Corruption Act and Indian Penal Code against the private parties and some of the public servants involved in the process of allocation of impugned coal block. Matter now be put up for consideration on November 25, 2014," Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar said in his order.
AHindalco spokesperson, when contacted for a comment on the matter, said it "is sub-judice and hence we would not like to comment on the same." The decision to allocate the mine to Hindalco was taken by the then prime minister Manmohan Singh.
CBI, however, has not questioned him or Birla in the matter.
Cheema told the judge that the court can take cognisance of the offences mentioned in the closure report as there was prima facie "evidence against the accused to show their involvement". During the hearing, Cheema along with CBI prosecutors VK Sharma and AP Singh, also said: "We are asking for cognisance on the closure report as there was evidence against the accused to show their involvement".
Cheema also said that some further investigation could be required in the matter on CBI's end. The court on September 12 had questioned CBI for showing what it termed as the agency's "hurry" in closing the case in which FIR was registered against Birla, Parakh and others.

Cairn India makes second oil find offshore Senegal  shares riseEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Oil explorer Cairn Energy  has made a second oil discovery off the coast of Senegal, sending its shares as much as 13 percent higher on Monday.
The British-based energy firm, which currently has no producing assets, said on Monday it had found oil at its SNE-1 well around 100 kilometres off the coast of the west African country.
The well, located near its FAN-1 well where it found oil last month, could hold 150-670 million barrels of recoverable resources, Cairn said about its preliminary estimates.
Analysts said the two successful oil discoveries could provide Cairn with an option to sell parts of its 40 percent stake to raise cash for its 2015 exploration work in northwest Europe and Morocco.
Cairn is the operator and 40-percent owner of three blocks off the coast of Senegal, while other stakeholders include oil major ConocoPhillips, which owns 35 percent.
The oil explorer has been unable to tap its $1 billion stake in Cairn India, a business whose backdated taxation practices are being investigated by Indian authorities.
Shares in Cairn were up 9 percent at 172 pence by 0849 GMT.

ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: New Delhi has been ranked 25th among the world's 'Most Fun' cities with Germany's capital Berlin topping the survey.
New Delhi, the only Indian city to make the top 25 cut, was chosen among over 1,800 cities surveyed across the globe.
The Indian capital ranked high for its sports clubs, shopping and bars in 'The Ultimate Fun City Ranking' report commissioned by 'GetYourOwnGuide' and 'GoEuro' travel firms.
The two firms compiled data based on 11 factors such as nightlife, average beer price and entertainment options to define what exactly makes a city fun for travellers of different age groups and interests.
Of the total 1,830 cities, Berlin topped the rankings for its all-round attractiveness of bars and museums, followed by London, Paris, New York and Tokyo completing the top 5.
"New Delhi scored well across the board, which earned it 25th place out of the 25 most fun cities. On a more unorthodox section, Bangkok came out top for adult entertainment, followed closely behind by Tokyo," Berlin-based GoEuro said in a statement.
"Our people (from 23 countries) are a reflection of the diversity in the problem we try to solve with technology... using technology to solve a real world problem," it added.
The online consolidated data-provider service for travellers across the European cities was founded by Indian entrepreneur Naren Shaam around two years ago.
"GoEuro is a uniform and normalised data structure for the entire European ground travel industry that serves over 19 million passengers daily across Europe," Shaam said.
By 2019, GoEuro plans to have partners in all European markets, from Portugal to Russia.

Our support to BJP for a stable Maharashtra: PawarMaharashtra’s interest behind this stance, says NCP
Mumbai, Nov 10:  
NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday reiterated that his party’s earlier offer to support the BJP Government in Maharashtra stands.
This came a day after Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackarey threatened to sit in the Opposition if the BJP, its ally at the Centre and former coalition partner, takes support from the NCP in Maharashtra.
Repeating his party’s stance since the State Assembly results came out on October 19, the NCP strongman said that to support the BJP is a “conscious and collective decision” in the larger interest of the State.
Pawar said the NCP and the Congress do not have enough seats to form a government. Hence, in the interest of having a stable government, his party has offered unconditional support to the BJP, which emerged with the highest number of seats.
Shielding ministers
When questioned if this move is designed to shield some of his ministers from investigations, Pawar said: “The Government at the Centre and the State is free to conduct investigations.”
However, he did not clarify on whether his party will vote in favour of the BJP government in Maharashtra, or abstain from voting altogether on November 12, when the new government will be required to prove its strength on the floor of the House.
“We will decide based on the situation then,” he added.
If the NCP abstains from voting, it will bring down the effective size of the house to 247, bringing the BJP within sniffing distance of comfortably winning the trust vote in the 288-member Assembly.
The BJP, which has 122 MLAs, needs to have at least half the House strength to cross the line.
Policy issues
“We have not been contacted by anybody from the BJP on the issue of our support,” Pawar said, adding that the NCP will oppose the BJP if any of its policies are “anti-people.”
Asked if he has sent a letter of support to the governor, Pawar said: “Why should we give anything in writing? We know how to act on the floor of the House.”

Toshiba to invest USD 30 bn to expand power biz in IndiaToshiba to invest USD 30 million to expand power biz in India
PTI     Tokyo/New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 18:42 IST

Japanese firm Toshiba Corporation will invest $30 million for expanding its production capacity in the power transmission and distribution business in India.
The investment is part of the company's plan to invest $100 million in Indian power sector by 2016.
Toshiba Corporation will reinforce its transmission and distribution (T&D) business in India with a 3 billion yen (approximately $30 million) investment in new production capacity at Toshiba Transmission & Distribution Systems India Private Ltd (TTDI) in Hyderabad, the company said in a statement.
India is a high-growth market that Toshiba has positioned as a strategic base for its power-related businesses. In the period to FY16, Toshiba plans to invest a cumulative 10-billion yen (approximately $100 million) in its T&D business there, including this current round of investment, said Katsutoshi Toda, CMD, TTDI.
Toshiba is seeking to secure a 20 per cent share of the Indian market by 2018, and also reinforce TTDI as a core T&D production base for other major markets, including Europe, ASEAN, and Africa, Toda said.
A new facility for large power transformers will come on line in 2015 at Hyderabad at the same time as the full scale launch of a new unit for switchgears.
Alongside its existing production line of small and medium capacity transformers and low and medium voltage switchgears, the new power transformer line will support production of 765 kV (kilovolt) transformers with a capacity of 500 MVA (mega volt ampere), while the new switchgear line will produce high voltage products.
Toshiba established TTDI in 2013 by acquiring T&D business from Vijai Electricals for 20 billion yen or approximately $200 million, and also started operation of a new power transformer facility in Russia in February 2014.

Maharashtra: Sena sits in Oppn as assembly session beginsShiv Sena sits in opposition in Maharashtra
Dharmendra Jore , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, November 10, 2014
First Published: 12:27 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:27 IST(11/11/2014)
As the new Maharashtra assembly held its first sitting on Monday, the Shiv Sena staked claim to the post of leader of the opposition even as it continued to negotiate with the BJP on joining the government.
 
The BJP confirmed talks were on but reiterated that the Sena should accept what was offered and stop demanding a certain number of ministerial berths or portfolios.
CM Devendra Fadnavis arrives for the three-day special session of Maharashtra assembly in Mumbai. (PTI photo)
Undermining the seriousness of the legislature’s procedures in its bid to pressure the BJP, the Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for leader of the Opposition. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray justified it saying he sent the letter to the legislature secretary because the Congress was rushing to grab the post.
“The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn’t work? Then we won’t get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader),” Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening. If the talks with BJP fail the Sena would perform the role of a strong opposition party, he added.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands —10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister — to vote in favour of the trust vote on November 12. The BJP is 23 votes short of a majority.
The two parties split just before the assembly elections after 25 years together. Now, both have taken strong positions on power-sharing, but are still talking. A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis himself would prefer to go with `natural ally’ Sena, but wants Thackeray to make `reasonable’ demands since the BJP already has 121 seats.
The Sena leadership, while slowly reconciling itself to sitting in the opposition, is wary the BJP could poach some of its 63 MLAs. It is also worried it could lose control of the Mumbai civic body, where it is in alliance with the BJP.
On Sunday, Thackeray asked Anil Desai, the Sena’s Rajya Sabha member who was to join Narendra Modi’s ministry, to boycott the swearing in. Later, he asked the BJP to clarify its stand on seeking the NCP’s support from outside.
On Monday, the Sena staked claim to the post of leader of the opposition a couple of hours after NCP chief Sharad Pawar reiterated his resolve to support the BJP from outside and ridiculed Thackeray for making remarks against him a day before.   
Armed with a plan B for winning the trust vote – support from the NCP and 14 to 17 MLAs from small parties and Independents -- the BJP was still hopeful of patching up with the Sena. It prefers the Sena because of their common ideology and experience of working together. The BJP was unwilling to go with NCP because of the party’s tainted track record.
The BJP can expect find the going tough if it leans on the NCP. Pawar gave it a veiled warning on Monday when he said that the BJP should reopen and inquire into all the cases (of corruption and irregularities) against his leaders. 
A confident Fadnavis, who said earlier his mandate (from the party high command) was to govern and not to save the government, put on a brave face by telling party colleagues that he would sail through in any case.
When asked, Fadnavis refused to comment on the matter.
A senior BJP leader told HT that the doors were kept open for the Sena even after the day’s development. “Talks with the Sena are on through several channels. We are still hopeful of the Sena withdrawing the claim [to the post of leader of the opposition] if we strike a suitable deal.”
 

Won t allow India to be defenceless against enemy: ParrikarComments
Newly sworn-in defence minister Manohar Parrikar said on Monday he will focus on "targeted completion" of defence projects to boost the country's defence, adding that the security of the nation will not be compromised.
The minister was addressing a press conference after filing his nomination for Rajya Sabha elections from Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, a day after being inducted into the cabinet.
Parrikar, who took oath on Sunday and was allocated his portfolio late in the night, said he was "feeling proud" to have filed his Rajya Sabha nomination papers from Uttar Pradesh.
"I consider myself  lucky," he added.
 
To a question, a smiling Parrikar, who quit as Goa chief minister on Saturday, said he came to know of his portfolio at 11.35pm on Sunday.
 
He said he needs to study his new ministry properly, before making any comments.
 
"I will study it properly and reply later," he told reporters.
 
Parrikar – who turns 59 next month – said his aim would be "targeted completion of whatever is required to strengthen India".
"I won't allow the country to be defenceless against the enemy," defence minister added.
Thanking his partymen and the people of the state, Parrikar also said he will be using his experience and would always keep the interest of in Uttar Pradesh in his mind.
 
Saying he will very soon learn to speak fluent Hindi, he assured party leaders that he will visit the state again after the end of the Winter Session of Parliament.
Parrikar was accompanied by Union micro, small and medium enterprises minister Kalraj Mishra and minister of state for skill development Rajiv Pratap Rudy when he went to Vidhan Bhawan to file his nomination before principal secretary Pradeep Dubey.
 
With Parrikar filing his papers for the Rajya Sabha polls, it would be for the first time in India's history that the Prime Minister, the home minister and the defence minister all would be representing UP.
 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a Lok Sabha member from Varanasi, Union home minister Rajnath Singh is a Lok Sabha member from Lucknow, and now defence minister Manohar Parrikar is likely to be elected to Rajya Sabha, based on the BJP's strength of legislators in the state assembly.
 
Polling for 10 Rajya Sabha seats will be held November 20. The ruling  Samajwadi party (SP) has fielded six candidates, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) two, and the Congress one. All are likely to get elected unopposed.

The listing of Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Pawan Hans on stock exchanges will improve transparency and efficiency, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said today.
State-run AAI manages 125 airports across the country. Among them are 11 international and 81 domestic airports. It also owns stake in some of the country's premium airports located in Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.
Pawan Hans, one of Asia's largest helicopter companies, has a fleet of 47 helicopters. The government owns 51 per cent stake in the company, the remaining 49 per cent is owned by another state-run company ONGC.
Pawan Hans provides helicopter support services to the oil sector for its off-shore exploration operations. It also provides charter services for promotion of tourism.
Both AAI and Pawan Hans are profitable companies. During 2013-14, AAI reported a profit of Rs 796 crore. AAI is expected to double its net profit for the current fiscal year to more than Rs 1,400 crore, sources said. Pawan Hans reported a net profit of Rs 11.70 crore during 2012-13.
Mr Raju said it is essential to ensure that Air India achieves its full potential. To achieve this, the government had decided to form an expert committee, which will decide on privatisation or other solutions, the minister said. For 2013-13 fiscal year, Air India reported a net loss of Rs 5,389 crore.
The government will also review the 5/20 guideline. The archaic rule makes it mandatory for a carrier to have 5 years of domestic flying experience and 20 aircraft to become eligible to fly on international routes.
Mr Raju said he will intensify efforts to get states to reduce taxes on aviation turbine fuel (ATF), which currently ranges between 4-35 per cent. Jet fuel constitutes over 40 per cent of an airline's operating costs.
The draft policy entails measures to enhance regional air connectivity, develop six major metro airports as international hubs, create more airports through PPP mode (public-private partnership) and improve passenger facilitation.
The civil aviation policy is expected to come into force early next year after consultations are done and an approval from the Union Cabinet is in place.

Twelve-day Mizoram assembly session to start Tuesday  delayed budget and four bills to betabledPrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: November 10, 2014 5:31 pm
Four bills and a delayed budget is set to be tabled before the house as the Mizoram Legislative Assembly begins its 12-day winter session starting Tuesday.
The session will finally see a full-fledged budget presented before legislators by Finance Minister Lalsawta after two vote-on-accounts of state finances in earlier sessions were necessitated by a delayed release of funds by the Centre. Mizoram depends on more than 90 percent of it’s finances on New Delhi.
Debates about the budget is likely to be stormy since the opposition parties have been raising the issue of the government’s “financial mismanagement” even as it has been reported that the salary component of the plan-fund has been axed to just half of last year’s, a much-discussed issue since the government is the largest employer in the state which has half it’s working population in the tertiary sector.
The Finance Minister has of late also spoken several times on the need to raise taxes to meet government expenses.
The upcoming session will also see the tabling of four important state bills, including one to regulate marriages, divorce and inheritances among residents and another for the setting up of a Lokayukta.
Various bodies including the powerful Mizo Students’ Association, also known as MZP, have been pressing for the setting up of a Lokayukta for years.
As many as 244 starred questions and 49 unstarred questions and two resolutions, including one for the ratification of the National Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2014, have also been submitted.

Next-gen Audi Q3 and RS Q3unveiledPrint
Audi Q3
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 5:41 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 12:52 pm
In the last few months, Audi has given mid-life upgrades to the A6 and A7 range in  international markets. While these refreshments do come up with a few functional  updates, they can be safely termed as cosmetic upgrades only. Which is a fair and  reasonable move on Audi’s part since why do they need to fix something if it is not broken?
In line with the refreshments given to the sedan range, Audi has now revealed the new face-lifted versions of one of the most accomplished SUVs in its line-up, the Q3. Slated to be launched in Europe early in 2015, the new Q3 will be available in standard and a more powerful RS Q3 version. Since Q3 does well in terms of volumes in India, expect Audi to launch it here without much delay.
On aesthetics front, the 2015 Q3’s front fascia features a more bolder look as its new ‘Singleframe’ grille with chrome bezels neatly merges to the headlamp on either side. The headlamp assembly receives the new Xenon Plus technology for the front headlights as standard, which is complemented by Audi’s signature LED daytime running lights. Discerning onlookers will also notice revisions in the front bumper design as compared to the older model. Audi will also be offering dynamic turn indictors (an array of LED bulbs that replace the conventional indictor bulbs and light up sequentially at a fixed time-gap) as an optional extra on the new Q3.
Moving on to the side profile, the new model has a similar silhouette as of the current car, however, the addition of a set of new tasteful alloy wheels give it a refreshed look. Similarly at the rear, the profile remains largely unchanged apart from a redesigned bumper and a pair of new LED tail-lamps. The sportier RS Q3, in addition to the listed updates, gets silver garnishing on front air dams and ORVMs; bigger 19- or 20-inch wheels, larger disc brakes, ‘quattro’ badge on the front grille and a single large exhaust pipe at the rear.
Step inside the new Q3 and you are treated with Audi’s usual high-quality cabin, which now comes with an updated MMI and infotainment system, Audi Drive Select system, new power adjustable front seats and different LED ambient lighting for the cabin. The RS Q3 on the other hand has identical cabin layout, although, you get a flat-bottomed steering wheel, ‘RS’ badges, sporty aluminium foot pedals and all black trim for the interiors that exude the sporty ‘RS’ roots of the brand.
Powertrain options include three petrol and two diesel engines. For international markets, at the lower end there will be a new 150PS producing 1.4 TFSI petrol engine on offer. This version will only be front wheel drive. Next in line is the old car’s 2.0 litre TFSI engine with power output rated at 180PS- a 10PS hike over the current model. The most continued…

What to watch: Macy s leads retail profit paradeEMAIL
Bust out your wallet. You’re going to need it this week.
Key big retailers report quarterly earnings this week. The holidays around the corner. Investors are paying close attention to see if cash registers are jingling.
Macy’s (M) kicks off the retail earnings parade — Wednesday. Are Macy’s efforts getting consumers in the door working? Discounts have been one lure. Can volume make up for lower prices? Analysts expect the company to report 8.5% higher profit. That’s one of the better showings among retailers.
Thursday is even bigger. Wal-Mart (WMT) , Kohl’s (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) all report. Wal-Mart’s is known for low prices. But lately, investors know Wal-Mart for low profit growth. Heavy investment in e-commerce is a profit drag now. Earnings are seen falling 1.8% during the quarter. Wal-Mart is rated a “hold” by analysts. Over at Kohl’s, it’s a similar situation. Earnings are seen dropping 8.6%.
Perhaps the high-end can bail out retail. Nordstrom is a bright spot. The retailer’s earnings are seen rising 4% on 8% higher revenue of $3 billion, says S&P Capital IQ.
Retail not your thing? There are still 55 stocks in the S&P 500 that haven’t reported. Tech stock Cisco Systems (CSCO) is one of them. Just don’t expect much. Analysts see this former high-tech darling posting no profit growth.
Guess you’re better off at the mall.

Gujarat first state to make voting must in local body electionsGujarat first state to make voting must in local body elections
Yahoo India –  Mon 10 Nov, 2014
Print
Gujarat became the first state in the country where voters will have to compulsorily vote in local body elections after Gujarat Governor O.P Kohli signed the Gujarat Local Authorities Laws (Amendment) bill recently, giving his approval for its implementation.
The bill had been passed by the state government twice when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
However, the then Governor Kamla Beniwal had not approved it, citing that the provision of compulsory voting was in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution and forcing a voter to vote was against the principles of an individual liberty.
The provisions of the Bill allow the government to punish and penalize any person who fails to vote during local body elections, though the nature of penalty has not been explained.
The bill also has a provision of about 50 per cent reservation for women in local body's elections.
The Congress Party said it would wait to see how the newly passed Gujarat Local Authorities Laws Bill, which makes voting in the local body elections in the state compulsory, is implemented on the ground.
"I think on principle it can't be criticised because it is a new idea, a new project and let us see how it works itself out... We need to see how it is actually implemented on the ground, for example, how will you implement the penalties, how will you punish, how will you do other things. So, therefore, let's wait and see," Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.

Millennials Love E-Gift Cards -- Can t Lose ThemEmail
Like most everything else in our lives, gift cards are going digital. And Millennials couldn’t be happier. They like gift cards, but prefer digital delivery and storage to plastic cards that can be lost, stolen or left at home.
“Plastic gift cards can take up a lot of real estate in your wallet, electronic versions don’t, and I think that resonates with Millennials,” said Jeanine Skowronski, a credit card analyst at Bankrate.com .

If you give a Millennial a digital gift card this holiday season, she'll be happy and she can't lose it.
Millennials are more than twice as likely as older adults to lose a physical card, according to a new report from Bankrate. In fact, 40 percent of the 18-29 year-olds surveyed admit to losing a gift card.
Bankrate found that a majority (59 percent) of the gift cards on the market can now be delivered digitally, up 18 percentage points from 2010.
Most electronic gift cards have a 16 digit code or provide a web link. They can be printed out and taken to the store, used online or accessed anywhere via email or text.
Mobile gift cards are specifically designed for smartphones. They have a bar code that can be scanned at the register by the sales clerk.
The Bankrate survey found that for Millennials, who live on their phones, mobile gift card usage is double that of older adults.
The personal touch
Many digital gift cards can be customized with a personal message, photos or video, making them a perfect fit for a generation immersed in social media.
Video: TODAY financial editor Jean Chatzky offers advice on how to be smart about spending this time of year, including booking flights eight weeks in advance, and using  balances on gift cards to buy holiday presents.
“This age group is all about instant gratification, so sending them a digital gift card that comes on their phone and has a video that makes them laugh, that really resonates with Millennials,” said Shelley Hunter with GiftCards.com.  (Hunter has written A Guide to eGift Cards .)
Sending electronic gift cards is easier than ever. You can go to the retailer’s website or shop at sites that sell discounted gift cards, such as GiftCards.com , CardCash , Card Hub , Cardpool and Gift Card Granny . And of course, there are also apps for that, such as Gyft , GoWallet , Giftly , GiftFly , GiftRocket and Yiftee .
While growing in popularity, electronic gift cards are still a small part of the overall market. Just eight percent of the $85.8 billion spent on gift cards in 2013 was for electronic gift cards, according to the Mercator Advisory Group .
“There will always be plastic cards because there will always be people who want to give something physical, but every retailer of any size knows they need to think about mobile in the near future,” said Ben Jackson, a senior analyst at Mercator. “We’re just in the beginning stages. We’ll see some really cool things in the future.”
It’s what we want… again
Gift cards are the most requested holiday gift item again this year, the eighth year in a row that they’ve  topped the National Retail Federation‘s Holiday Consumer Spending Survey , ahead of clothing, books, CDs, DVDs, video games, electronics or jewelry.
Remember, all gift cards are not the same.There are two basic types: merchant-specific and general purpose.
Cards linked to a particular store rarely have a fee, but they can’t be used anywhere else. General-purpose cards, with a bank or credit card logo, can be used wherever that credit card is accepted.
Millennials, Generation Xers and Baby Boomers all told Bankrate they prefer to receive general-purpose cards.  Unfortunately, that’s more expensive for the gift-giver because these cards have a purchase fee.
For its report, Bankrate analyzed the terms and conditions of 62 widely-held gift cards. All seven of the general-purpose cards charged a purchase fee, ranging from $3.95 to $6.95. Only seven percent of the store-specific gift cards had a purchase fee.
A few things to keep in mind
“If you get a gift card, try to use it quickly,” advises consumer advocate Edgar Dworsky, founder of ConsumerWorld.org . “That way you won’t lose it or forget about it, and you won’t get hit with a maintenance fee that’s going to nibble away the value.”
Keep in mind:  Under federal law, a gift card cannot expire for at least five years after the date of purchase. Some states, includingCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota and Washington, prohibit retailers from selling gift cards that expire. These laws do not cover general-purpose gift cards sold by credit card companies.
Hold onto the card long enough for it to expire and any remaining balance typically gets turned over to the state.

Battery charging  tire rotation and engine noise: Motormouth solves car problems0
A: There is nothing stopping you from rotating your tires now. Of course, they may make some noise or vibration, but that should eventually go away. When you do a four-wheel rotation, each of the tires spends some time at each of the four corners. Hence, they wear evenly and equally. Twice-yearly rotations may be fine, but we prefer to go by mileage. Every 10,000-12,000 miles seems to work for us. When you buy new tires, have the suspension checked and aligned if necessary. Cupping is often due to worn shock absorbers.
Q: My 2004 Land Rover Discovery has a loud rattling noise coming from the engine area only when I'm driving it. It gets louder the faster I go, but when I come to a stop and the car is just idling the noise stops. I have been told that it's the front differential. Just what is that and can I drive for long with the car sounding this way? Is this repair expensive and can my mechanic fix it or do I have to go to the dealer?
— R.B., Mount Prospect
A: A differential converts the rotation of the driveshaft (longitudinal) to the two axles driving the wheels (lateral or crosswise). While doing this, it also allows one wheel (the outermost) to turn faster than the inner wheel when turning. Quite a nice trick. Two-wheel-drive vehicles have one differential, either front or rear. Four-wheel-drive vehicles have one at each end. If it fails, you are going nowhere. A good tech can repair it or, in many circumstances, replace it as a unit and save some time if not money. Yes, it is expensive, but get it fixed soon.

Want to get a good rate on a new mortgage? Two tips: Be wealthy, and borrow more.
For the first time in recent memory, lenders are offering well-heeled buyers large “jumbo” mortgages at the same — or even better — interest rates as smaller loans. The trend is helping fuel a resurgence at the high end of the real estate market. Sales of homes priced $1 million or more are soaring as lower-priced properties lag, accentuating the uneven nature of the economic recovery.
The share of homes selling for at least $1 million fell when the 2008 financial crisis hit, but it recovered faster than the rest of the market during the past two years. It now hovers at a level last seen near the housing boom’s peak in 2007, according to research firm CoreLogic. The rates help, and so does a robust housing market.  The number of homes sold for $1 million or more climbed 8 percent this year while those at every other price point combined fell 4 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors.
The sales at the higher end are clustered in a few pricey areas, including the Washington region, where purchases of expensive homes also have rebounded to near pre-crash levels, according to a Washington Post analysis of local sales adjusted for inflation.
One in eight single-family homes in the District sold for at least $1 million in each of the past two years — just below the 2007 peak level, the analysis found. While $1 million may not sound like a lot of money in the D.C. area, it is double the region’s median price, according to Real Estate Business Intelligence, a subsidiary of the local multiple listing service.
Banks are helping tilt the market. Burned by the reckless loans of the housing boom, many lenders are turning away potential buyers who lack stellar credit and hefty down payments, and chasing after affluent home buyers by offering favorable terms and interest rates.
Related: How to save a down payment for a home
“Many people are finding out by accident that they can often get a better rate on a $700,000 mortgage than a $400,000 mortgage,” said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. “The opportunities for wealthier borrowers are now better than they’ve been in a decade as far as rates and terms.”
Kathleen McEnerney and her husband sold their D.C. condominium last year to buy a house in Potomac, Md. for slightly more than $1 million. The proceeds from the condo sale would have covered the cost of the new home, McEnerney said. But instead of paying cash, the couple decided to take out a jumbo loan.
The cheap rates were too good to resist, said McEnerney, a director at a local utility. The couple got an adjustable-rate mortgage with a 2.875 percent interest rate. Another draw: the tax benefits.
Homeowners can deduct interest paid on mortgages of up to $1 million from their federal taxes as well as the interest paid on up to $100,000 of home equity debt.
“It’s the first time in a long time that we’ve had a mortgage,” McEnerney said. “But it was a matter of freeing the money up to be able to invest it in other types of assets.”
Among lenders, competition to lure well-heeled borrowers like McEnerney is fierce.
Overall mortgage lending by dollar amount plummeted 44 percent in the first three quarters of the year compared with a year ago, mostly because a recent multi-year refinancing craze has fizzled out, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. The industry is looking to drum up business elsewhere, and they’re turning their attention to home purchases.
But they’re being selective, and catering to jumbo borrowers with lots of assets, cash, and high credit scores. The dollar volume of jumbo lending now makes up 20 percent of all home purchase loans, the highest level since 2002, the trade publication reported.
Lenders are holding onto those mortgages instead of selling them to investors, confident that the loans are of solid quality, said David H. Stevens, chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association. “Banks are much more comfortable in the wealth market,” he said.
Hanging onto the mortgages puts the lenders at greater risk if the borrower defaults, but it also gives them more leeway to offer cheaper rates and more flexible terms, said Cecala from Inside Mortgage Finance. In many cases, the rate on jumbo loans is now lower than the rate on smaller loans backed by mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — and perhaps what’s even more surprising is that it’s been that way through 2014, he said.
Traditionally, the reverse has been true, with rates on Fannie and Freddie loans at least a quarter of a percentage point lower than jumbos. But those smaller loans are also more expensive now because Fannie and Freddie have raised certain fees that are reflected in the interest rates.
These jumbo loans are defined differently across the country. In most parts of the United States, jumbos are loans that exceed $417,000. But in D.C. and a few other expensive markets, they are loans in excess of $625,500.
The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage of $417,000 or less was 4.17 percent last week, and the rate on larger loans was 4.13 percent, according to a survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association.
To get the best rates, buyers must bring plenty of cash to the table. Todd Wood, a builder in Bethesda, said he’s seeing that firsthand with his customers, many of whom are selling their first homes to buy newly built ones in the $1.5 million to $2 million range.
“They’re putting down 20 percent or more. I’m even seeing down payments of up to 50 percent,” said Wood, founder of CastleWood Builders. “But even if you put down 50 percent, you’re not going to get the best rates or the most favorable terms if you don’t have a good credit score. And you might not get the loan at all. I’ve seen that happen.”
In the Washington area, the greatest recovery has been in Arlington, where more than 1-in-5 single-family sales are for at least $1 million, just below the peak reached in 2005. The market share of pricey homes in Arlington dropped by half during the housing bust, falling even faster than the market as a whole. But the share has grown steadily in the past four years.

One doctors old-fashioned idea to cut health care spending: house callsBy Jeff Guo November 6 Follow @_jeffguo
Physician Peter Boling visits patient Helen Shadoan at her home at the Heritage Oaks retirement home in Richmond, Va. Boling is leading a program that attempts to help the elderly avoid expensive hospital stays by bringing medical care to them.  (Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)
RICHMOND, Va. — The two medical students in the back seat lurch left. Then right. Then left again.
“I’m hoping you guys are not vertiginous or anything,” calls out Peter Boling, 60, as his taupe Passat carves the winding, wooded road to his afternoon house call.
Boling, an affable geriatrician who looks like George Bluth but drives like Jeff Gordon, has been visiting elderly patients in their homes since 1984. In those early years, as a newly-minted faculty member at Virginia Commonwealth University, he staffed a clinic in the morning and made house calls in the afternoon.
Home visits, by then, already had become passé. In the 1930s, doctors saw patients at home about 40 percent of the time. In the 1980s, nearly all visits took place at the physician’s office or at a hospital. Less than 1 percent were house calls. Modern medicine was centralizing, trapping primary care physicians in their own webs of equipment and auxiliary staff.
Boling’s experiences, though, convinced him that there is still a role for medicine in the home, particularly for the frailest of the elderly. These patients need more attention than a 15-minute clinic appointment affords them. For many, just getting to a clinic is a struggle. So a slight complaint is allowed to fester into a crisis, an ambulance and an expensive emergency room visit.
“The idea is to deliver health care where it’s best for the patient,” Boling says. “If the clinic is the right place for them, then come to the clinic. If it’s hard for them to come to the clinic, short-term or long-term, we’ll go to them.”
Boling revs through a turn, sending up a puff of rust-red leaves. He tells the students how he got to this moment today.
Decades ago, he and his colleagues at the American Academy of Home Care Medicine embarked on a saga to spread this very personal way of caring for sick elderly patients. Studies were done. The system saved money. Patients were healthier. Families were happier.
Still, few wanted to pay for this rather old-fashioned model of health care. Medicare reimbursed at a paltry rate for house calls. Most of the house-call outfits ran at a loss, subsidized by grants or a sponsoring hospital. The doctors realized that if they wanted to change how medicine was practiced, they had to change how Americans paid for it.
Their efforts came to a head with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which funded a three-year incentive program called Independence at Home. Like many of the other cost-saving experiments that the ACA set into motion, Independence at Home does not propose an entirely new way to deliver health care. It just demonstrates a new way to fund it.
The 17 participating house-call practices are to get an annual bonus — dating to 2012 — based on how much money they saved Medicare by keeping their patients healthy and out of the hospital. The results of the first year are expected to come out shortly. Because these house-call teams serve some of Medicare’s sickest — and most expensive — patients, the savings could be huge.
In 2005, the Congressional Budget Office calculated that the top 5 percent of Medicare cases in a given year account for 43 percent of total costs. Overall, Medicare accounts for 14 percent of the national budget, or about $500 billion annually.
For the teams of doctors and nurses participating in the study, those savings would translate into thousands of additional dollars in revenue per patient each year — the kind of money that would allow the teams to hire more staff members and pay a competitive salary.
Boling has another mission. The nation faces a dire shortage of family doctors, especially those who focus on the elderly. And no wonder: Primary care is exhausting. The hours are long and the pay is paltry compared with specialties such as dermatology or plastic surgery.
“One of my goals, my career-long goals when I quit, is to have established an economic model that makes this a desirable mode of practice,” Boling says. He understands that medical school debt is crushing. “But I think if I could pay these guys like a hospitalist, like a junior cardiologist or something, many of them would be flocking to our door.”
All of which explains why, today, Boling is driving two second-year med students to see 93-year-old Helen Shadoan.

Boling and his students pull into the parking lot at Heritage Oaks, a retirement complex 15 minutes from downtown. A tottering ragtime tune issues from the common room piano.
The crowd shuffles inside Shadoan’s spare living room. On a wooden table in the corner, a white Teddy bear leans against an empty flowerpot. An oxygen machine and its tubes are neatly arranged near the entrance.
Shadoan, 93, sits in a pink gown facing the single window. A rotation of home-care aides looks after her round-the-clock. She is blind and hard of hearing, but her voice is still lustrous. She used to be an audiovisual technician, she says, developing photographs and making charts.
“Do you still remember where you used to work?” someone asks.
“Certainly!” she says. “The Veterans Administration — well, I guess it’s Veterans Affairs now.”
Marie Gerardo, the nurse practitioner in charge of her case, begins to tell Boling about Shadoan’s recent brush with pneumonia. Autumn is a perilous time for the elderly. A couple of weeks ago, Shadoan began to run a fever.
“Her temp in the evening was 101.5 and her pressure when I was here was in the 80s over 60s,” Gerardo says. The room inhales all at once. “So I was begging her to go to the emergency room, literally.”
But Shadoan flatly refused.
Boling leans over to talk into Shadoan’s ear. “When you had that pneumonia, you were really sick,” he says. He grew up near Boston but he has worked nearly his entire career in Virginia. These days his voice slips into a slight twang when he talks to patients.
“Did you feel really sick?” he asks.
“No, I didn’t feel that bad,” Shadoan says. “I just didn’t have that much energy.”
Boling tells the students that this common among older patients, who often can’t tell how sick they actually are.
“I wanted her in the hospital,” Gerardo continues. “And Ms. Shadoan, at 93, was very emphatic about not going. She’s blind and extremely hard of hearing, so a hospital visit is horrible for her.”
“They just give me a nervous breakdown,” Shadoan says.
That day, Gerardo had acquiesced. She ordered a mobile chest X-ray and started Shadoan on antibiotics. She did not force her patient to go to the emergency room.
This, in the end, was the right call. Shadoan was more comfortable at home. She was spared an unnecessary hospitalization, and Medicare saved money.
“It probably took her a bit longer to get better, but in reality she was probably better served not being in the hospital,” Gerardo says. “She has done really quite well.”
Boling turns to the two student doctors standing near the wall. Shadoan is still recovering a bit from the pneumonia, and Boling wants the students to break out their stethoscopes. How does her chest sound? Do they think Gerardo made the right choice?

When President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, most of the nation focused on how the law would extend health-care coverage to more Americans. Recall the bitterly debated insurance mandates; the push to expand Medicaid that some governors foreswore as federal meddling.
Although concerns about ballooning medical spending had gotten the ball rolling on health-care reform, the actual legislation did not roll out grand plans for containing health-care costs. Instead, the law created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to oversee a salvo of demonstration projects, each promising to zap various inefficiencies in the system.
A curious fact about health care in the United States is that most doctors can diagnose its dysfunctions in an instant. They know they should spend more time with their patients, and spend more time following up on them. They want to. They also know they should talk more with nurses, should talk more with social workers, should talk more with psychiatrists, should talk more with pharmacists, and so on.
But by and large, the system can punish those instincts. Most doctors have little opportunity do the kind of coordination and follow-up that leads to better health outcomes. You cannot bill Medicare, for instance, for spending an extra hour on the phone trying to figure out why your patient didn’t get her at-home oxygen tank. But that might be exactly the kind of miscellaneous assistance she needs to get better, and the kind of assistance she might never receive because no one has the time to notice the problem, let alone delegate it to a social worker, if there even is one on staff.
“The system pays for the bricks, but it won’t pay for the cement,” says Bruce Kinosian, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.
One of the goals of the ACA is to figure out, in different ways, how to pay for that cement.
Earlier this year, Kinosian co-wrote a study on the house-call programs operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs. He and his colleagues — including Thomas Edes, the VA’s director of geriatrics — compared the medical costs of patients before and after they entered a house-call program. They found that the VA’s house-call teams not only paid for themselves, but they also went on to reduce overall health-care costs by 12 percent. In part this was because patients were 25 percent less likely to go to a hospital.
In the VA study, patients also reported sky-high satisfaction ratings: 83 percentsaid their care was “very good” or “excellent.”
Another study this year, also in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, compared patients in a D.C. house-call program to a carefully matched control group with similar diseases and medical histories. The house-call patients cost Medicare 17 percent less. About half of the savings came from reduced hospitalizations, and another chunk from keeping patients out of nursing facilities.
A theme of modern health-care reform has been a process called “aligning incentives.” That means, for instance, fining hospitals that discharge patients who quickly land in the hospital again. It also means paying for results, not for individual procedures. Boling and his colleagues have lobbied hard for the government to recognize the savings and increased satisfaction that their house-call programs generate.
Independence at Home, which is limited to 10,000 patients, is an attempt to show how house-call practices can get a cut of the savings they generate. The Medicare office uses a statistical model to predict how much each patient is expected to cost each year. If a house-call team can bring their patients’ costs below the prediction, through better care or fewer emergency room visits, Medicare will share the savings with that team. Medicare takes the first 5 percent saved each year, and gives the doctors 80 percent of any savings thereafter.
Under this formula, a house-call team might get a couple of thousand of dollars extra per patient per year if it can reduce a costs by 10 to 15 percent — a reduction that’s in line with what the studies predict. The money would be a great boon to these practices, most of which can handle only 200 to 500 of these complex, sick patients. (A typical primary care physician might serve 2,500 regular patients.) In his practice, Boling could use the money to hire a couple of extra social workers or physicians.

Boling, who chairs the geriatrics division at VCU’s medical school, runs two house-call teams at the university. He staffs each with a handful of physicians and nurse practitioners, along with social workers, triage nurses and, recently, a pharmacist. Once a week, the teams assemble to discuss their patients and various aspects of their lives.
This is the kind of health care that Boling thinks millions of elderly Americans should have access to: comprehensive, in-depth and insistent.
“We get into every little part of their medical history and their social history,” says Susanna Payne, a nurse practitioner. “I know how many grades she completed in school, I know what she used to do for work. I know how how many kids she has, how many are still alive. How many are actually involved in her care.”
The program is not for everyone. Boling’s doctors focus on the most complex cases: people with multiple chronic illnesses, who rarely leave the house. These are the ones who benefit most from the careful services they provide.
On a recent Thursday, with her colleagues gathered around a conference table, Payne runs down the information on one of her newer charges. Mary is an 82-year-old with high blood pressure, a pacemaker and impaired vision from macular degeneration, with a history of vertigo and stroke. She recently went to the emergency room because she felt dizzy and her urine was dark. The doctors there diagnosed her with a urinary tract infection and sent her home. (Mary’s last name has been withheld for privacy reasons.)
These are the kinds of unnecessary ER visits that the team tries to prevent. Someone could have helped her over the phone, or with a quick visit. The team always has someone on call 24/7.
For five years, Payne says, Mary has been relying on the emergency room for her primary care. “She’s used to calling 911 and going to these hospitals when she really needs something,” Payne tells the group.
It takes “a little while for people to get used to having access to care, to learn to rely on us,” Boling says. “It doesn’t usually take too terribly long for people to find that they don’t like the ER experience as much as having someone come to their house.”
On a recent house call, Mary complained of painful calluses on her feet. Payne arranged a visit from a podiatrist. Mary also showed Payne a $200 bill for a medical bracelet that she could not afford. Payne immediately e-mailed the team’s social worker to see if she could get the bracelet for free.
“When you go into someone’s house, you stumble across these things that you wouldn’t necessarily stumble across in clinic, that really do cause a great deal of anxiety,” Payne says.
Treating very frail elderly patients often requires treating families. Physician Amy Paul brings up another patient she’s worried about, a bedbound 87-year-old woman who lives with her daughter and grandchildren. The daughter, who looks after her mother, is supposed to be seeing a psychiatrist, but she hasn’t been going. The daughter’s blood-sugar levels also recently were so high that she needed a shot of insulin from the ER. But during her home visit, Paul saw the daughter having sweet tea with crackers and Doritos — terrible foods for someone with high blood sugar.
“It’s going to take a couple of visits with a lot of education,” Paul says.

In Helen Shadoan’s apartment, kneeling in the afternoon light, Sarah Hughes lifts her stethoscope to the elderly woman’s chest.
All med students at VCU are required to sign up for a house call. Hughes wants to become a pediatrician. She’s used to being in clinics, where she says the pace is much quicker — 20 minutes per patient, tops. By now, they’ve already been in Shadoan’s room for 35.
Gerardo instructs her to lean closer and talk in a deeper voice so that Shadoan can hear her.
“Hi, Ms. Shadoan,” Hughes says. “I’m a student. My name is Sarah. Can I listen to your heart?”
“Certainly,” Shadoan says. “Just tell me what you want me to do.”
“You just sit there. You’re doing great,” Hughes says.
“You guys have been remembering to observe when you walked in, right?” Boling says, as the students wrap up. “You noticed the oxygen tubing and the walker. Now, Ms. Shadoan can’t see, so she’s already adapted her environment to some extent. She knows where everything is in this apartment, exactly.”
The conversation turns to her daily routine. She wakes up at 5 or 6 every morning and switches on MSNBC. She likes political talk shows, “Morning Joe” in particular.
She voted for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in the 2008 presidential race, and Obama in 2012. “Well as far as I’m concerned, he’s okay,” Shadoan says of the president. “He’s not the best one we ever had. He’s certainly isn’t the worst.”
The best one?
“Oh my, I don’t know,” she says. “Maybe FDR. He’s the first one I ever voted for.”
Someone asks for her thoughts on the Affordable Care Act.
“Well, I don’t quite understand it,” she says, pausing. “My son’s thoroughly against it. But I think there must be some good parts to it.”

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."

Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.

Nike severed ties with Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson after his plea agreement to a misdemeanor assault charge over the whipping of his 4-year-old son.
The world's largest sporting-goods maker had suspended Peterson's endorsement contract in September after he was indicted for striking his child with a tree branch to discipline him. Nike has now completed the separation, spokesman KeJuan Wilkins said Thursday in an e-mail.
Nike seems to be using people and then spitting them out. Why does this not surprise me?

Peterson was fined $4,000 on Nov. 4 by a Texas state judge and ordered to perform 80 hours of community service after he pleaded no contest to reckless assault. He will serve no jail time. His return to the National Football League's Minnesota Vikings will hinge on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who is the only one who can reinstate him.
In September, Nike also ended its endorsement deal with fellow running back Ray Rice. The company severed ties in this case only after a video showing the former Baltimore Ravens player punching his then-fiancee unconscious. Rice had been arrested in February, though criminal charges were later dropped in exchange for court-supervised counseling.
Nike has a history of maintaining relationships with star athletes when controversies prompt other sponsors to sever ties. It stood by basketball player Kobe Bryant when he faced charges of rape, later dropped, and stayed with golfer Tiger Woods following reports of infidelity.
The Beaverton, Oregon-based company has said the use of performance-enhancing drugs is a reason to sever ties. Nike terminated a deal with bicyclist Lance Armstrong after he admitted doping. Last year it released Major League Baseball player Ryan Braun, a former National League MVP, after he was suspended for drug violations.

U.S. lawmakers urge DOJ to investigate Takata and its fatal airbag defects.
Report: Takata knew of air bag defect as far back as 2004.
 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic lawmakers on Friday called for the U.S. Justice Department to examine whether air bag-maker Takata broke the law, as authorities study the dangers of the safety device that is now part of a sweeping recall.
The statement comes a day after the New York Times reported that officials with Takata Corp examined air bag dangers in 2004 but halted the probe after initial tests raised concerns.

Branson Pickle: Billionaire s  Space -Adventure Follyreddit
Before Richard Branson's space plane crashed over the Mojave Desert last week, killing the co-pilot and badly injuring the pilot, somewhere between 500 and 700 people (depending on what news report you've been reading) had signed up to ride to the edge of space, but not out into the deep, dark void. Let's be generous and take the larger figure, so at US$250,000 a pop, that's an eventual $175 million, deposits paid.
But with the fragile-looking SpaceShipTwo capable of taking only six paying passengers at a time, that represents just over 116 flights destined to last two hours each and give the well-heeled a few moments of weightlessness. Then what? Is this a sustainable business that will return some of the hundreds of millions from investors such as the Abu Dhabi government and the state of New Mexico? Are there many hundreds more super-wealthy folks who are willing to go where the brave celebrities -- actors, singers, you-name-its -- have gone before? There are, but are they?
Despite last week's catastrophe -- not the result of a new fuel mix that exploded or rocket-engine failure, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, but possibly owing to the erroneous unlocking of the tail mechanism too early -- Virgin Galactic, which is attempting to create the world's first spaceline, has vowed to move ahead with the project. But in the wake of this tragedy, there is grandiose talk that really is out of this world.
This week the company founded by billionaire Branson -- a dyslexic high-school dropout who started off selling records and moved on to airplanes and much more -- moved to counter widespread criticism that his latest project, now 10 years in the making, is little other than a joyride for the vacuously super-rich.
"For Virgin Galactic, everything rests on our vision of creating accessible and democratized space that will benefit humanity in countless ways for generations to come ... From research, to travel, to innovation, we believe that the technology our industry is pioneering is crucial to the advancement of humanity," the company said in a statement .
It's great to read but hard to believe -- especially when we've all been here before. Well, perhaps not all of us, and certainly not me. I hadn't yet arrived on Earth by time Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit our lonely and increasingly imperiled planet. The year was 1961, the decade of messy free love and a virgin planetary race to space that saw the United States beat out arch-rival Russia to land men on the Moon a mere eight years later.
So, no, with Branson's craft -- destroyed, yes, but a second is nearing completion -- only hurtling a mere 60 miles up into the incomprehensible vastness of the universe, using more or less conventional technology, there won't be any laudable benefits to humanity; instead, the planet will suffer on as yet more tons of carbon from burning fossil fuels are dumped upon us. Branson's feeble craft is, in reality, little other than a glorified airplane engaged in a depressing vanity project.
Virgin Galactic seems hopelessly named and hopelessly fated: It isn't anywhere near galactic; its craft don't even leave the confines of Earth. It's fair to say they will never get anywhere near our nearest neighboring galaxy, Andromeda, at least in our lifetimes and those of many more to come. The audacious project has, sadly -- and ultimately tragically, as three others were killed in a ground-based test-firing of a rocket in 2007 -- been constructed on hype and image, orchestrated by the savvy showman and boosted in the media by celebs' ready signing up for an outrageously expensive cheap thrill, when they really should know better (is it the blinkered-celestial view they hanker after or the "adulation" of being the first, even though they would be far from it?) -- but then all of this thrives on the fuel of publicity.
And as we reached the end of this week, Branson was still busy on social media and with posting blogs, reminding "future astronauts" who won't even go into orbit that their cash deposits remain "fully refundable" -- and that yet more people had signed up for the flight of fancy. (The company says 20 passengers cancelled following the accident.) He delighted in telling us that "we have had inquiries about purchasing Virgin Galactic tickets this week, including many new Future Astronauts either signing up or in the process of signing up to show solidarity with the team and the project."
In the end, it is Branson, propelled by an overarching sense of boyhood adventure, or desperate folly, and rocketing to establish himself in the pantheon of brave travel pioneers, who has become entangled in a Gordian knot of his own vainglorious making and from which he does not know how to untie himself. It could be the undoing of a once-great entrepreneur.

Deepak Parekh says stock markets not helping Indians; only FIIs making big gainsFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Raising concern about over-dependence of Indian capital markets on foreign institutional investors, eminent banker Deepak Parekh has said that something needs to be done to change this pattern.
“There is too much dependence on foreign institutional investors (FIIs), and I think we have exported our capital markets abroad. We have to do something to change this pattern,” Deepak Parekh told a capital markets meet organised by the ISB here over the weekend.
“Who is really benefitting from our well regulated equity markets? It is not the Indians, it is not our institutions, it is not our labour, it is not our retirees, but the FIIs,” said Deepak Parekh, Chairman of mortgage giant HDFC.
FIIs’ stakes in the Sensex companies hit an all-time high of over 27 per cent in June this year. Their holdings in the wider BSE 200 Index reached an all-time high at 24.5 per cent, as per BofA-ML’s Jyotivardhan Jaipuria.
Incidentally, HDFC as also group firm HDFC Bank are among companies with very high FII holdings.
The companies where FIIs have exhausted their permissible investment limits include Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, IDFC, IndusInd Bank, Lupin, Maruti and Titan among others. The sectors where there is still some room comprise banks, cement, auto and consumer goods.
“We all know how fickle FIIs are. They move in and out of the markets effortlessly and there is a herd instinct. History is replete with examples of how sudden reversals in capital flows can cause extensive damage and volatility to a country’s financial system,” Parekh warned.
A vocal proponent of free market, Parekh also crticised the government for using the divestment as a tool to “plug the fiscal deficit,” and said state-run firms like LIC should not take holdings in other PSUs as part of divestment programme.
He also expressed displeasure at no progress being made on the front as yet, saying bunching up of issues towards the end of the fiscal reduces market’s absorption capacity.
He also said the government has been “hanging on senselessly” with equity in many public sector companies such as BSNL and Air India as private companies have done very well in their sectors.
Alleging that investigating arms of the government like the CAG or CVC have “little understanding of valuations”, Parekh also came out strongly over action taken against civil servants under whose leaderships such stake sales happen.
He further blamed the investment bankers and promoters for being greedy and commanding higher valuations in FY08, which saw a record initial public offerings and said that this behaviour has waned investor interest later.
“The cardinal rule is that one has to leave something on the table for investors, otherwise they will completely back out of such funding,” he said, adding the number of issuances have been few even though we are in the midst of a bull-run in the market at present.

Safety  customer satisfaction will be my priority: Suresh PrabhuSafety, customer satisfaction will be my priority, says new Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu

Suresh Prabhu on Monday took over as the new Railway Minister and said rail safety and customer service would be his priorities, as he seeks to unleash the true potential of the transport behemoth.
"We have faced lots of challenges in running the railways in the past. We do have potential which has not been properly utilised," he told reporters after assuming charge.
Prabhu, who took oath as a Cabinet minister on Sunday shortly after he joined BJP from Shiv Sena, replacing SD Sadananda Gowda who was shifted to the Law ministry in the reshuffle.
"The Prime Minister has decided that the condition (of railways) has to change. Our two focus areas will be customer service and railway safety as passenger safety is increasingly becoming an area of concern," he said.
Observing that the people have reposed lot of faith in the government, he said the steps they undertake in railways will be seen in due course of time.
"What we will do will be seen in due course of time, so no announcement will be made is the announcement," he said.
Prabhu said the economy is also dependent on railways.
Railways are an integrating factor for the economy and, "if we work in this direction we can propel economic growth," he said.
With the public transporter having the largest workforce in the country, Prabhu said addressing their concerns will also be high on his agenda as they are the driving force behind the railway's journey.

Nifty Edges Higher To Notch Up New Closing Record
Reuters | Updated On: November 10, 2014 18:25 (IST)
Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
The BSE Sensex and Nifty hit record highs on Monday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's push to expand his cabinet raised further hopes for economic reforms, but gave up most of their gains towards the end of the session as investors booked profits.
The Sensex earlier rose as much as 0.57 percent to a record high of 28,027.96, its fifth all-time high in six sessions.
Mr Modi beefed up his cabinet on Sunday, appointing a separate defence minister to spur military modernization and free Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to focus on the budget and reforms to revive the economy.
The larger cabinet was welcomed by business groups impatient for the Modi government to get the economy out of a long slowdown.
But traders also said the temptation to book profits was high ahead of consumer inflation data on Wednesday and given recent strong gains. The Sensex has gained 32.30 percent this year making India the best performing equity market in Asia.
"The freedom to chose cabinet underscores Modi's ability to take fast decisions. This phase of profit-taking would not last for long," said G. Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics, a research and fund advisory firm.

Why L&T Shares are Down Despite Q2 Profit BeatYou are here: Home Market
L&T Shares Fall on Q2 Margin Dip, Guidance Cut
NDTV | Updated On: November 10, 2014 15:41 (IST)
Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
Larsen & Toubro shares fell over 3 per cent on Monday as the engineering and construction major's quarterly margin failed to impress the Street. L&T's Q2 ebitda margin grew at 11 per cent in the September quarter as compared to 13 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year. Q2 results were announced post market hours on Friday.
A Maybank analyst said the fall in margins was on account of "execution of low margin work". L&T has an order backlog of Rs 2.1 trillion, the brokerage added.
A cut in 2014-15 revenue guidance also weighed on shares. L&T said its revenues are likely to grow between 10-15 per cent this fiscal as compared to earlier stated guidance of 15 per cent.
"The company is facing execution challenges in three sectors - power, metals, and hydrocarbon. To factor this, we marginally cut our FY15 revenue forecast growth to 12 per cent from 15 per cent earlier," Maybank said.
The stock, however, traded off the day's low as L&T ticked most of other key boxes in its Q2. Net profit rose 6.5 per cent rise in Q2, beating analyst forecasts on the back of new order wins in its infrastructure, power and hydrocarbons businesses.
The company said in a statement that net profit came in at Rs 1,042 crore for the three months to September 30. The average estimate of eleven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters was for L&T to make Rs 952 crore.
Last year L&T, which lays roads, constructs ships, makes power plant equipment and develops real estate, reported net profit of Rs 978 crore.
Market analyst TS Harihar said the disappointment in Q2 has been on account of front-ending of expectations from L&T. Q2 numbers are a short-term negative for the stock, he added.
L&T shares ended 2.1 per cent lower at Rs 1,619 apiece, underperforming the Nifty which closed 0.1 per cent higher on Monday.
Brokerages on L&T Q2:
Maybank cut its target price to Rs 1,967 from Rs 2,000. It also cut its profit growth forecast for FY15 to 9 per cent from 12 per cent earlier. FY16/17 profit will rise to 18 per cent as the current backlog of Rs 2.1 trillion (2.3 times revenue) provides strong revenue visibility, it added.
Retaining its buy rating, CLSA said the key positive was 83 per cent of orders booked in domestic market. L&T will take advantage of revival in infra investments, it added.
Citi continues to be neutral on L&T and advised investors to switch to Voltas, Havells and Cummins. However, it added that L&T will benefit immensely from domestic economy recovery.
Macquarie said L&T will see sharp earnings acceleration beginning FY16 and is the best way to play a turnaround in India.

Coal India Shares Shrugs Off Q2 Earnings, Rise 2.5%
NDTV | Updated On: November 10, 2014 10:43 (IST)
Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
Shares of Coal India rose over 2.5 per cent today, shrugging off a lower-than-expected Q2 results. Despite the earnings miss, brokerage firm Macquarie said Coal India's stock valuation remains attractive at 10 times FY16 earnings and cash balance at 30 per cent of market capitalization.
The government is looking at doubling the production output of the state miner to a billion tonnes in the next five years. "I see Coal India production doubling in the next five years. It makes about 500 million tonnes hopefully this year. We'll do a billion tonnes in 2019," Mr. Goyal said at the India Economic Summit.
Macquarie says Coal India's profit can "double in three years under a blue-sky scenario." Coal India shares are flat so far this year as compared to over 30 per cent gain in Sensex.
The sales of the coal miner in the second quarter rose 2 per cent year-on-year to Rs 15,678 crore. Its profit fell 28 per cent to Rs 2,192 crore from a year earlier, with average realisation down 5 per cent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 1420/tonne.
Seasonal weakness and a cut in e-auction volumes have been attributed for the sharp drop in the coal miner's profit. Its e-auction volumes, which fetches better price, fell sharply to 3 MT in Q2 from 17 MT in Q1.
Coal India's e-auction volumes fell after the miner was directed to meet the power sector requirements which forced it to cut volumes through auctions where it gets higher prices.
Its profit was also impacted by higher expenses. Total expenses increased to Rs 14,144 crore in the July-September quarter of this year from Rs 13,112 crore in the same period last year. The bulk of the expenses were on employee benefits, on which the company spent Rs 7,286 crore, while contractual expenses went up to Rs 1,626 crore from 1,393 crore.
At 10:35 am, Coal India shares were up 1 per cent to Rs 347.

The company's profitability as represented by its EBITDA margin fell drastically to 2 per cent against 19 per cent y-o-y. Analysts say turnkey segment which contributes more than 40 per cent to its revenue saw massive cost overrun.
Analysts also said that its EBITDA margin was impacted because the company executed low margin orders.
In the analysts meet conducted post results, the management has also said that further provisioning cannot be ruled out.
EIL shares ended 12.5 per cent lower at Rs 236.60 apiece, underperforming the Nifty which ended at 8,344.25, up 0.09 per cent.

Obamacare Shoppers Get Sneak Peak At New Prices TonightObamacare Shoppers Get Sneak Peek At New Prices
Posted:
reddit
Health insurance consumers using HealthCare.gov will get their first look at the prices for 2015 coverage starting Sunday night, when window shopping goes live on the website, federal officials announced Sunday.
Shoppers won't be able to choose a health plan for 2015 until Nov. 15, when the three-month enrollment period begins. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is providing early access to estimated health insurance premiums and the value of subsidies available to low- and moderate-income households. The window-shopping tool proved to be the most-visited part of HealthCare.gov during the first Obamacare enrollment period, officials said.
HealthCare.gov , which serves insurance consumers in more than 30 states , debuted Oct. 1, 2013, without the ability for people to window shop, which forced users to create accounts and begin applications for coverage before they could view prices. And since the website was barely functional for the first two months of the six-month sign-up period last year, the absence of this tool made it nearly impossible for people to gauge whether they could afford coverage -- and put greater strain on the system -- until the feature was added.
Obamacare officials said they would release an analysis of the health insurance premiums for 2015 later this week.
"We think the news is largely positive," said Kevin Counihan, the CEO of HealthCare.gov and the director of the Center for Consumer and Information and Insurance Oversight within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Independent analyses based on health insurance pricing information made public by state regulators have shown modest average premium increases for Obamacare plans across the nation. According to the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, rates will rise an average of 6 percent in states that have reported 2015 prices. The changes vary greatly, however, so some consumers will see double-digit increases while others will see prices go down if they keep their current coverage. The number of health insurers selling plans on the exchanges also is increasing by about 25 percent .
Consumers will be automatically re-enrolled into the plans they have this year if they are still being sold by their insurance carriers, but Counihan stressed that federal officials want individuals who already have coverage through the exchanges to revisit the website to ensure they're getting the best deal based on the new prices and the subsidies they can receive based on their incomes.
"The majority of our customers will be able to save money by shopping and comparing," Counihan said during a conference call with reporters Sunday. "We are strongly encouraging our customers to return back to HealthCare.gov, update their income and eligibility information, shop and compare, and see if there are better values out there for them."
Next year's prices will be available Sunday night on both HealthCare.gov and CuidadoDeSalud.gov , the Spanish-language portal to the federally run exchanges. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia operate their own exchanges and will provide premium information on their own schedules, the federal officials said.
The health insurance exchanges will open on time next Saturday, said Andy Slavitt, principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. "We've hit all the critical deadlines," he said. "We're not contemplating anything unusual or out of the ordinary, regarding Nov. 15."
The HealthCare.gov team has streamlined the application process most consumers will use, and has completed more than a month of testing to ensure the website functions this time. The website also will be able to serve more users at a time than it did during the first enrollment period.
Officials said it will be easier than it was last year for visitors to HealthCare.gov to access the window-shopping tool and view estimates of the price and benefits of plans available in their local area before this sign-up period.
Shoppers can provide their zip codes, approximate income and information about the make-up of their households to get a look at what's available and what it costs, including the effects of tax credits to reduce premiums, and subsidies to reduce out-of-pocket costs. Then users can sort health insurance plans by price and level of benefits, view information on what services are covered or not covered, and see how much they will pay when they receive medical care. When consumers find a plan they may want to purchase during the enrollment period, they can print out or email the information to themselves or save the link to that plan.

ABU DHABI: Big oil companies such as Total can withstand oil prices at $80 a barrel and the French firm will continue its current investment projects, Total's president for exploration and production said on Monday.
"$100 was a good level to ensure continuous supply of projects for the future," Arnaud Breuillac told a news conference at a major energy industry conference in Abu Dhabi.
But he added, "Large companies like Total have financial capability to weather a bit of time when the oil price is lower," and said Total did not want to cut back its investment budget.
"We will continue with our capital discipline. We have a strong roadmap for the next few years with a lot of projects, and all of them will continue."
Breuillac also said Total did not think oil prices would stay as low as $80 for long.

Phishing successful 45 per cent of the time: Google study

LOS ANGELES: Certain websites included in phishing emails successfully lure users up to 45 per cent of the time, according to a new Google study.
Researchers at Google and the University of California, San Diego found that emails that try to trick users into handing over their information work way better than believed.
Once the user reaches bogus pages, which tend to imitate legitimate sites, 14 per cent of people unwittingly submit their information to hackers, 'Huffington Post' reported.
The study found that the percentage of people who get tricked was "much higher" than they expected.
Researchers looked at 100 phishing emails picked out of a random sample self-reported by Gmail users.
They also reviewed a random sample of 100 phishing websites caught by Google's Safe Browsing system to further understand how the scams work.
Investigators were then able to look back and see how people interacted with the emails and websites.
The study found even on the worst-performing phishing websites, 3 per cent of users still submitted their data. On the most effective phishing sites, as many as 45 per cent did.
Researchers said 20 per cent of hackers access compromised accounts within 30 minutes of getting their credentials.
This is big business for scammers, as one attacker can be responsible for millions of phishing emails, Google noted.

Bharti group s Sunil Mittal demands  respect  from govt  wants support for India Inc to counter China abroadEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Indian companies will need active help from the new government in expanding overseas, but such support has been lacking in the past as against China which has always put its might behind its enterprises, leading industrialist Sunil Bharti Mittal said today.
“We are facing might of Chinese state wherever we go abroad,” said Mittal, who heads telecom-to-retail conglomerate Bharti group.
Sharing his experiences from the past, Mittal said when his company ventured into Sri Lanka, the government there was expecting assistance of USD 100 million for a project.
“I conveyed it in MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) and officers in PMO (Prime Minister Office) but nothing moved after that. I could only convey. Few months after that, China doled out cheque of $1 billion to Sri Lanka which helped its companies,” Mittal said at the India Global Forum here.
He said Indian companies started venturing abroad and investing big after Tata acquired European steel firm Corus in 2006 and soon it was followed by acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover.
“Indian companies are making big investments abroad. Some of them are extremely successful, some moderate and some are in the process. In Africa, I have seen good amount of goodwill for India. Though we cannot match the amount of money they (China) commit in Africa but government can support Indian businesses there,” Mittal said.
Airtel acquired African telecom operator Zain in 2010 for $10.7 billion. The telecom major operates in 17 African countries but is yet to register profit.
At the same event, Wockhardt Chairman and Group CEO Habil Khorakiwala said that Indian companies have brought down price of HIV drugs by about 98 per cent in Africa which was earlier unaffordable for people there.
Mittal said positive changes are taking place under the new government but more needs to be done.
“PM (Narendra Modi) is now making bold moves overseas. He asked us to introduce ourself in Japan,” Mittal said.
But unlike foreign businessmen who are made part of delegation when their ministers visit overseas, Indian businessmen are given a badge which says “coinciding with visit of Prime Minister”, he added.
“I have asked senior officials to at least make ‘accompanying’ if not call it delegates. We deserve some respect,” Mittal said.
Bharti Enterprise chairman recalled a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Russian President Vladimir Putin where Russian conglomerate Sistema’s chairman Yevtushenkov was present during the meeting between heads of the two states.
Mittal said, “A PMO official after the meeting asked me who is Yevtushenkov and said Putin was asking PM why don’t you give a telecom licence to him.
“I said you should have taken me along with you and I could have also asked for licence in Russia.”
Indian businesses can play key role in helping the government build good relationship overseas but states also need to support them, he said.
US companies like Google, Facebook, Apple get tremendous support from their governments, he added.

We need more govt support to invest abroad: Sunil MittalMore govt support needed for investment abroad, says Sunil Mittal

Making a strong pitch for economic diplomacy, Sunil Bharti Mittal, founder and chairman of Bharti Enterprises on Monday called for much greater government support for extending Indian enterprise abroad.
"We don't have the massive state support required to push the soft power of Indian enterprise, as companies get in the US, UK, France, Germany," Sunil Bharti Mittal , said at the India Global Forum in New Delhi hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
The owner of Airtel Africa that operates in 17 countries, Mittal said lack of adequate government support becomes an additional hurdle in a context like in the continent where it is impossible to match the money power of Chinese state companies.
"We cannot match the amount of money the Chinese are putting in Africa. The good news is we have tremendous amount of goodwill, our relations have developed for over a century. Any leader of any standing in Ethiopia has been taught by Indian teachers," he said.
From Africa, Mittal gave the recent example of corporate action abroad "as an important arm of the government to do things they cannot do" like in controlling the Ebola epidemic in the continent.
"The government leans on us for the efforts on Ebola control in 3-4 countries. We went in quickly into Sierra Leone, where we operate, and then into Liberia and later to Nigeria, Ghana and DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo)," Mittal added.
Bharti Airtel has also agreed to join a pan-African mobile telephone fundraising campaign that would allow 700 million subscribers to make donations with their mobile devices to Ebola control.
Citing the instance of Bangladesh where issues like Teesta river waters-sharing also affected business relations, Mittal said: "Businesses are affected to a large extent by the relations between states. Yet we don't have the full extent of state support."

Rupee Ends Higher at 61.88 After RBI Policy Review
Mumbai: The rupee strengthened on Monday, tracking emerging market currencies as the dollar weakened following weaker-than-expected US jobs data, although caution ahead of consumer inflation data later this week tempered some of the gains.
The rupee also failed to get much of a lift from shares, which hit their latest record highs earlier in the session but ended flat as investors booked profits.
Traders are looking ahead at the consumer prices data due on Wednesday, amid rising expectation the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could opt for earlier-than-expected cuts in interest rates should inflation continue to ease.
"Markets will watch out for the CPI data for immediate direction. Outlook for rupee broadly remains positive but global dollar strength will have some effects on the rupee," said Hari Chandramgethen, head of foreign exchange trading at South Indian Bank, predicting a range of 61.30 to 62.30 for the week.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.4950/5050 per dollar compared with 61.6425/6525 on Friday. The unit had hit an intra-day low of 61.6750 in the previous session, its lowest level since October 17.
The gains tracked higher emerging market currencies after data on Friday showed US employers added 214,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month, a bit smaller than economists on Wall Street had expected.
Traders will continue to monitor the dollar's moves as well as foreign fund flows.
Foreign investors have bought shares worth a net $1.2 billion in November, taking total inflows so far in 2014 to $14.89 billion. Net inflows into debt in the year stand at $22.85 billion.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.81, while the three-month was at 62.87.

Defence deals to be transparent  faster: Manohar ParrikarManohar Parrkiar asked everyone to give him time to understand the issues concerning the new Ministry. (Source: PTI photo)
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 6:39 pm
Manohar Parrikar today took charge as Defence Minister and said the defence acquisition process will be transparent and fast under his stewardship.
58-year-old Parrikar met with Defence Secretary R K Mathur and all the three Services Chiefs minutes after he took over in his South Block Office.
The new Minister echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make-in-India” slogan and said the country should manufacture “as much as possible” domestically.
“Very unfortunate. Whatever will be there will be very transparent but fast process. I think that is one of my specialties,” he told reporters here replying to a question about the delayed acquisition process in the last 10 years and defence deals often getting mired in corruption.
He asked everyone to give him time to understand the issues concerning the new Ministry.
Parrikar, who earlier today filed his nomination paper to Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, said he was “equally worried” over the recent sinking of a torpedo recovery vessel off the coast of Visakhapatnam and recalled the series of accidents that the Navy has had over the last year and a half.
“Let me first take real grip of the situation so that the exact position can be expressed to you,” he said.
With his task cut-out, Parrikar, an IITian, thanked Modi for reposing confidence in him by giving him this “very important and sensitive Ministry”.
“I am also aware that Jaitley (who was holding Defence as an additional charge) has done, in spite of constraints, a lot of initiation work on many of the issues concerning the defence and I am quite confident of taking them ahead with speed,” he said.
The former Goa Chief Minister admitted though he has exposure and good administrative experience, the type of requirement at the national level may be different.
“I was left with no time. Let me be frank. I had to virtually pack in five minutes. Two days was given for all the excercise,” he said while requesting the media to give him time to understand the issues concerning the Ministry.
Asked about Modi’s “Make-in-India” slogan, Parrikar said the Prime Minister has been very clear in opening up of the defence sector.
“I feel that as much as possible we should manufacture here in India. Any country with good manufacturing ways, irrespective of defence or any other, can come up economically by generating a lot of employment opportunities,” he said adding he hopes to make use of his ministerial colleague Rajiv Pratap Rudy’s new Skill Development Ministry.
“Skill development is a very important issue and the reason why we need that is that in earlier years, skill was passed down (generations). Now we have to train people. New skills have come up, new requirement. We need to develop that fast. Defence also needs it in all continued…

Shiv Sena to sit in Opposition in MaharashtraPrint
Sena-BJP ties hit a new low in the wake of a spat over Cabinet expansion at the Centre and failure to accommodate the Sena in the Maharashtra government in Mumbai.
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 6:26 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 9:30 pm
The Shiv Sena on Monday staked claim to the leader of opposition post in the Maharashtra Assembly, but maintained that it was still open to talks with the BJP. “While we are firm on staking claim to opposition leader role, we are not denying the possibility of holding talks with BJP. We are always ready for a dialogue with BJP,” Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray said.
The Sena’s flip-flop in the Assembly and outside seemed to suggest a divide within the organisation, with several MLAs still urging Thackeray not to take an extreme stand against the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in the state.
Though Sena’s MLAs occupied opposition benches in the Assembly on Monday morning, the discomfort was visible on their faces.
The Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, submitted an official letter to the state legislature assembly secretariat, claiming its right for the leader of opposition post as it is the second-largest party in the state with 63 MLAs. In the 288-member house, BJP currently has 121 MLAs, the Congress has 42 and the NCP has 41.
Sena’s Member of Legislative Council Neelam Gorhe announced, “We have submitted the letter to stake claim to the role of opposition leader in the Assembly.”
The legislature secretariat confirmed: “The Shiv Sena has the right to the post of opposition leader.”
However, a disgruntled MLA said on condition of anonymity, “It is strange that being the second largest party, we are in the opposition. We should have played our cards carefully to bring BJP to the negotiating table to form the government.”
A senior BJP leader confided, “Officially, talks between the Sena and BJP may have come to a standstill. But back-channel negotiations are underway. Everything will become clear on November 12.”
The BJP has held Sena responsible for taking an extreme stand by not allowing Anil Desai to join the Union cabinet on Sunday. A party source said, “BJP president Amit Shah had sought consent from Thackeray to induct Desai.” The Sena insisted that they would like to see at least two candidates inducted in the cabinet.
The source added, “The central leadership told them that since they have given only one ministerial post to alliance partner Telegu Desam Party, it would not be proper to give two posts to Sena.” However, Sena was assured that their demand for the induction of another minister would be considered in the coming days. At that point, Thackeray had agreed. But 10 minutes before the swearing-in, Thackeray reiterated his earlier demand. The BJP told him that things cannot be reworked at the last minute.
According to sources, “Thackeray urged the BJP emissary to connect him continued…

Will not destabilise BJP govt  but will play Opposition role: Sharad PawarBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 10, 2014 6:14 pm
NCP chief Sharad Pawar, whose party has extended crucial outside support to the BJP government in Maharashtra, on Monday said the decision was prompted by the need to avoid fresh elections but made it clear that the party will play the role of an effective Opposition.
Pawar said the decision to back the minority government was “conscious and collective” and not part of a “hidden deal” with BJP.
“We have not discussed our decision with anyone. It was a conscious and collective decision in the larger interest of the state. Nobody asked us for our support. BJP is free to not accept our support,” he told a press conference.
Pawar said since Congress and NCP were not in a position to provide an alternative government, the only way to avoid a fresh poll was to back the BJP dispensation.
“The number game is such that there is no (possibility of) alternative arrangement. We don’t want the state to go for another election immediately,” he said.
Rubbishing suggestions that NCP had lent unconditional outside support to the BJP government as part of a “hidden deal”, Pawar said,” The government is free to investigate all the charges and allegations against NCP leaders so the truth can come out. If its decisions or bills are not people oriented, we will not support the government.”
“Even though NCP will not destabilise the government, it will play the role of an effective Opposition,” he said.
The NCP leader also slammed Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for his yesterday’s remark on “saffron terror” attributed to him.
While issuing an ultimatum to BJP, Uddhav had said his party will sit in Opposition if the government took NCP’s support for its survival as Pawar had spoken about “saffron terror”.
Nobody asked us for our support. BJP is free to not accept our support.

Knowing more about finance does not lead to better financial decisions.
In fact, some of the most supposedly financially knowledgeable people -- mutual-fund managers -- don't make better financial decisions than other people, according to a new study by Michigan State and Notre Dame researchers, as reported in The Atlantic.
It's the latest evidence that a years-long campaign to help normal Americans achieve "financial literacy" is ineffective at best and misguided at worst. As The Atlantic notes, expert stock-pickers in finance and forecasters in other fields have been derided for decades as no better than dart-throwing monkeys .
When it comes to getting ordinary people to know more about finance, however, the consensus has been that this time it’s different. On the surface, it’s a well-intentioned and uncontroversial mission: Helping people help themselves by making better decisions. And there's plenty of evidence that people have a scary lack of financial knowledge: One study found that just a third of Americans would correctly answer three simple financial questions.
And those questions are models of transparency compared with the opaque language consumers often face when making even the simplest financial decisions. The goal of making people financially literate seems to imply that it's the individual’s responsibility to safely navigate what is often intentionally inscrutable financial language.
The same companies who create the problem of financial products Americans can’t understand push financial literacy as the solution. For instance, Bank of America thinks the key is an online course . The financial industry’s self-regulatory organization has an entire foundation devoted to investor education .
But financial literacy in this gauzy, generalized form simply doesn’t work. The Cleveland Fed found no “conclusive support that any benefit at all exists” from financial education as it is currently taught. Shocking no one who has been to high school, one study showed that taking a financial literacy class in high school does nothing to improve financial literacy.
And a study by researchers at the Brookings Institution could not find “strong evidence that financial literacy efforts have had positive and substantial impacts."
In a 2011 presentation titled “The Financial Education Fallacy,” Lauren Willis , a professor at Loyola Law School, shot down the idea that “ordinary consumers would have made better mortgage choices and would have accumulated sufficient precautionary savings to weather the recession" if they'd just been financially educated. Straightforward consumer protections, like putting limits on how many single stocks people can own in retirement accounts, are most effective. Financial education is no substitute for financial regulation, she argues.
There is evidence that giving people specific information about a specific product (say, about credit card debt for people who are interested in applying for a credit card) works better . It’s not easy, given the mountain of details involved. But single-serving consumer information is likely to be far more helpful than vague goals of getting Americans to solve their own financial problems by thinking them through.
Personal finance author Helaine Olen has called financial literacy “both a failure and a sham.” This conclusion deserves to be widely accepted.
When mutual-fund managers are making dumb decisions, it’s time to admit that making average Americans generally more financially literate is not a useful goal. Starting with clear-cut consumer protections and unbiased information about specific financial products is far more helpful.

This Is A Game ChangerStarbucks Plans Delivery After Sales Fall Short
 | By                                                                CANDICE CHOI

NEW YORK (AP) — After reporting disappointing quarterly sales Thursday, Starbucks said it will offer a delivery option on its mobile app in select areas of the U.S starting next year.
The Seattle-based company declined to provide more details, but has been pushing to get people to use its app as a way to build customer loyalty. It also previously said it plans to let customers across the country place orders ahead of time on their smartphone by next year, an option intended to get people in and out of stores quicker.
"We are playing offense," CEO Howard Schultz said in explaining the various steps the company is taking to adapt to changing customer habits, including their move toward online shopping and away from brick-and-mortar stores.
The delivery plans for the second half of 2015 were announced by Schultz during a conference call Thursday discussing the company's fiscal fourth quarter results. For the period ended Sept. 28, Starbucks reported sales that rose but fell short of Wall Street expectations. Global sales at established locations rose 5 percent, including in the Americas and Asia.
Starbucks Corp. is pushing aggressively into different areas as it faces more competition from fast-food chains serving specialty coffees. To boost sales of food in the afternoon, for instance, it has been revamping its sandwiches and adding new offerings like a grilled cheese sandwich that's warmed up in an oven.
This summer, Starbucks also launched its Fizzio soda drinks in the Sunbelt. But Wells Fargo analysts said in a note this week that their checks at a dozen stores in six states suggested the drinks aren't performing up to expectations so far.
In a phone interview, Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead said the soda drinks are doing "exactly what we expected it to do," but that a national launch isn't planned for 2015. In a previous interview, Alstead had said he expected the drinks to be in much of the U.S. by the upcoming summer.
Alstead said Starbucks is instead focusing on growing its tea business. He said tea accounted for a "high single digit" percentage of sales last year, and that the company expects it to reach "well into the teens" over time.
For the quarter, Starbuckst earned $587.9 million, or 77 cents per share. Not including one-time item, it earned 74 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet.
Revenue came in at $4.18 billion, short of the $4.24 billion analysts expected.
For the current quarter ending in December, Starbucks expects its per-share earnings to range from 79 cents to 81 cents. Analysts expected 83 cents per share. The company expects full-year earnings in the range of $3.08 to $3.13 per share.
Shares of Starbucks were down 4 percent at $74.04.

Facebook Launches Ebola Charity Donation ButtonRecipes From the First Thanksgiving
Nov. 22, 2006
Everyone's favorite roving correspondent, Mike Barz, went on an American adventure perfect for the holiday season.
Barz visited Plymouth, Mass., site of the Mayflower's landing and the first Thanksgiving in 1623.
The folks at Plimouth Plantation shared some of the early settlers' first Thanksgiving recipes, which you'll find below.
The Ancient New England Standing Dish
New World pumpkins and squashes were introduced into Europe in the late 15th century.
By the time the colonists had made their way to Plymouth, "pompions," as pumpkins were called by settlers of the era, had gained widespread acceptance in England.
In New England, stewed pumpkin was everyday fare -- a "standing dish" -- particularly in the fall and winter.
This recipe for stewed pumpkin comes from John Josselyn, an early traveler to New England.
His description of the common dish is full of wonderful details that provide both a sense of how the finished dish should taste ("tart like an apple") and a vivid glimpse into a colonial kitchen ("stew them upon a gentle fire a whole day.")
"The ancient New England standing dish" is one of the earliest written recipes from New England.
The Ancient New England Standing Dish
But the Housewives manner is to slice them when ripe, and cut them into dice, and so fill a pot with them of two or three Gallons, and stew them upon a gentle fire a whole day, and as they sink, they fill again with fresh Pompions, not putting any liquor to them; and when it is stew'd enough, it will look like bak'd Apples; this they Dish, putting Butter to it, and a little Vinegar, (with some Spice, as Ginger, &c.) which makes it tart like an Apple, and so serve it up to be eaten with Fish or Flesh: It provokes Urin extreamly and is very windy. -- John Josselyn, New-Englands Rarities Discovered, 1672
Modern version:
4 cups cooked squash or pumpkin, mashed
4 tablespoons butter
1-2 tablespoons of cider vinegar
1-2 teaspoons of ground ginger (or any combination of nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and or pepper, to taste)
1 teaspoon salt
Place the squash, butter, vinegar and spices in a saucepan over low heat. Stir and heat until all of the ingredients are well combined and hot. Adjust the seasonings to your liking and serve.
Serves 8
You Say Pompion, I Say Squash
Pompion is the common 16th and 17th century English word for what we now call squash and pumpkins.
Squash, the shortened, English version of the Narragansett Indian word asquutasquash, first appeared in print in 1643.
Confused? It only gets worse. In reality, there is absolutely no botanical difference between squash and pumpkins.
William Woys Weaver, in Heirloom Vegetable Gardening, explains that "pumpkin is merely a term of convenience, for there are only squash. … Pumpkins are really a type of squash."
Ducks With Cranberries and Wine
This duck recipe -- even with a few New England adaptations -- is the most luxurious in this chapter, both in the cooking techniques employed and in the ingredients used.
This is the sort of dish that would have occupied a place of honor on a fine feast table in 1621.
The original recipe from 1615 uses tart barberries in the sauce. It is possible that in Plymouth in 1621, English cooks substituted cranberries for the unavailable barberries.
The increasing availability of ducks in local grocery stores makes it a lovely option for a Thanksgiving bird of a different sort.

A rare hormonal condition caused her breasts to balloon. Surgery was the answer.Sometimes the pain would shoot through her chest without warning — a sharp, debilitating burn so excruciating that Kerisha Mark was convinced she was having a heart attack.

Other times, it started in her shoulders before crawling up the nerves in her neck and settling inside her head, where it would blossom into a full-blown migraine that could last for days.
Each time Mark ended up in the emergency room, doctors told the 40-year-old high school social worker from Beaumont, Tex., the same thing: She wasn't having a heart attack and, no, she didn't have a brain tumor, either.
The problem was her breasts.
More specifically, their size. Mark had always had an exceptionally large bust, she said, but by her late 30s, her chest had ballooned to size 36NNN due to a rare hormonal condition called gigantomastia.
The condition, which results in the massive enlargement of breast tissue, can occur during puberty or pregnancy. Gigantomastia can also unleash a spate of health issues that quickly begin to take their toll; for Mark, they included pulled muscles in her chest, severe back pain and emotional distress.
"I could not run or jump or work out at all," she told The Post. "I was very limited in a lot of things I could do. I mean, you can't find a sports bra that size anyway."
Mark estimates that her breasts weighed around 15 pounds each and said that she began using duct tape to hold them in place.
After several years of reluctantly considering surgery, Mark decided to get a breast reduction from Franklin Rose, a well-known plastic surgeon based in Houston. Rose told The Post that he couldn't recall seeing a patient with larger breasts in almost 35 years of work as a plastic surgeon.
"The breasts really hung down to her hips and were essentially like carrying around three basketballs at all times because they were so large," he said. "When we went into the exam room — I don't know if I would use this word 'shocking,' but it was certainly startling to see breasts of that magnitude."
Fortunately, Rose said, breast reduction surgery is largely the same regardless of the patient's breast size, though he was forced to bring in a second assistant to facilitate the four-hour surgery in September, just days after Mark's 40th birthday. During the procedure, Rose said, he removed 15 pounds of tissue.
... and after. (Debbie Porter Photography/Utopia Plastic Surgery and Medspa handout)
"The challenge is not so much what you remove, but what you leave behind to make a pretty breast," Rose said. "We left her with a nice full DD that she was very happy with."
Left untreated, he added, Mark may have developed degenerative kyphosis, a condition in which a person's spine curves forward, forming a hump or "hunchback."
More than a month after her surgery — which, she said, was covered by insurance — Mark said she's feeling much better and that her symptoms have disappeared. In addition to losing weight from her breast reduction, she's dropped another 10 pounds in recent weeks.
She plans to start exercising again. She is also picking out a new wardrobe, she said, and is excited about purchasing her first bathing suit in two decades.
"Getting my breasts reduced was like a divorce," she said. "And like a bad relationship, you don't always realize how bad things were until it's over."

Obamacare in Illinois: Higher premiums  more choices  regulators say30
IlliniCare Health is new to the marketplace this year, and will be offering HMO plans in Cook County to a very specific target market — low-income consumers no longer eligible to be covered by Medicaid. Partnered with the Sinai Health System on Chicago's West Side, and Swedish Covenant Hospital on the North Side, the plans were created to follow the so-called "churn" population, whose increased income qualifies them for private insurance.
Previously, IlliniCare Health worked exclusively with the Illinois Medicaid population. The company is part of St. Louis-based Centene, which offers Medicaid plans across the country through contracts with 17 states.
"We wanted to focus on those neighborhoods in the city that sometimes get left behind," said Lindsey Artola, spokeswoman for IlliniCare Health. "I think a lot of plans are focused more on the higher-income, healthier populations, and our sweet spot has always been the most vulnerable, so that's what we're targeting our marketplace product to as well."
Lake County residents are likely to see higher premium increases on average than those in other Chicago-area counties, including Cook, according to state data. Lake County rate increases are in the 5 to 10 percent range for the lowest-cost silver plans, while Cook, DuPage and Will counties can expect increases of zero to 5 percent, according to a map released by the insurance department.
Plans on the health care marketplace range from bronze for the least expensive premiums through silver, gold and platinum, which has the highest premiums. However, bronze plans generally have the highest out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, copays and coinsurance, while platinum plans have the lowest out-of-pocket costs.
During last year's enrollment, 56 percent of Illinois residents who bought plans on the exchange picked a silver plan, 29 percent picked a bronze plan, 15 percent picked gold and 1 percent picked platinum.
Those with household incomes up to $46,680 for a person and $95,400 for a family of four are eligible for subsidies.
According to examples supplied by the Illinois insurance department, in 2015 a single 30-year-old in Chicago or Peoria with a household income of $23,000 could be eligible for a subsidy of $72 per month in Chicago or $88 in Peoria. That could bring his or her monthly cost to $119 per month in both cities on the second-lowest-cost silver plan, compared with $121 per month this year.
A couple from Chicago or Peoria, both age 55, with household income of $40,000 could be eligible for a subsidy of $479 in Chicago and $540 in Peoria. That could bring their costs for the second-lowest silver plan to about $273 per month in 2015 versus about $276 this year.
Consumers must select a plan by Dec. 15 to avoid being automatically re-enrolled in the same plan and to ensure coverage  Jan. 1. Open enrollment ends Feb. 15.

Judge confirms Detroit plan to exit historic bankruptcy

The largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history is near an end.
Detroit won U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval on Friday for a road map to end its fiscal free fall and revitalize a city sinking under a huge debt load and dysfunctional government.
Judge Steven Rhodes confirmed the city's plan to shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations and plow $1.7 billion into improvements, finding it both fair to creditors and feasible to implement.
"The city has worked honestly, diligently, and tirelessly to accomplish precisely the remedy that the bankruptcy code establishes for municipalities," Rhodes said in the ruling he read from the bench.

He acknowledged the anger the bankruptcy fueled among many Detroit residents and urged them to look forward.
"And so I ask you, for the good of the city's fresh start, to move past your anger. Move past it and join in the work that is necessary to fix this city," he said.
He also called Detroit's inability to provide adequate services to its residents "inhumane and intolerable," saying that the city's plan aims to fix that problem.

Once the proud symbol of U.S. industrial strength, Detroit fell on hard times after decades of population loss, rampant debt and financial mismanagement left it struggling to provide basic services to residents. During the 15 1/2-month bankruptcy process, the city's historic collection at the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) came into play as a potential pot of assets to satisfy creditors.
The journey through Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy began on July 18, 2013, with major creditors girding for battle, and has wound down in a flurry of settlements. A so-called Grand Bargain taps in to $816 million from foundations, the DIA and the state of Michigan to ease pension cuts and protect city-owned art work from sale.

In his ruling, Rhodes said that settlement, which was key in winning the support for the plan from Detroit's two retirement systems and scores of city workers and retirees, "borders on miraculous." Bigger cuts to retiree healthcare were justified because that benefit, unlike pensions, was not protected under Michigan's constitution, he said.
However, a deal that granted unsecured holders of the city's unlimited tax general obligation bonds a 74 percent recovery was possibly at the top range of reasonableness, Rhodes said. He also noted that bond repayment can no longer be the only top budget priority in Michigan ahead of pensions.
Richard Ciccarone, head of Merritt Research Services, said Detroit changed the risk profile for municipal bonds.
"It's a milestone for municipal credit risk. If we look back over the past 50 years, this stands out as evidence that municipal bonds are not risk-free."
Two companies that guaranteed payments on Detroit bonds and were the last major holdout creditors in the case, Syncora Guarantee Inc and Financial Guaranty Insurance Co , received options to develop parcels of land. Rhodes imposed the plan on two classes of miscellaneous creditors.
With the cost of Detroit's consultants and lawyers topping $140 million, Rhodes said a process will be established to determine if those fees are reasonable.
Attending Rhodes' ruling were Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, who took Michigan's biggest city to bankruptcy court, and Mayor Mike Duggan, who is now tasked with carrying out the plan. Orr came under fire from many Detroit constituents and city-elected leaders when he was appointed by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to turn the city around.
"The rule of law, comity, civility and unity prevailed. Sometimes not too easily - but eventually," Orr said at a news conference following the ruling.
Duggan, at the same news conference, took issue with Rhodes' concern that it is a possible conflict of interest for the mayor and a member of the city council to have a seat on a nine-member, state-created oversight board for a post-bankruptcy Detroit.
"I am going to sit on that financial review commission to make darn sure that every single document they ask for, every single concern they raise is responded to promptly by the city of Detroit," Duggan said.
Snyder, who authorized the bankruptcy, also noted at the news conference that much work remains to be done. "We need to redouble our efforts on the neighborhoods, to make Detroit a place where people want to raise their families."

Mystery Of Dinosaur Feathers Finally Has A Solutionreddit
Why did dinosaurs have feathers millions of years before the first reptiles took to the air?
Paleontologists have been puzzling over that question for years. But now an answer may finally be at hand, thanks to a fascinating new study by researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany.
“Until now, the evolution of feathers was mainly considered to be an adaptation related to flight or to warm-bloodedness,” the study's first author Marie-Claire Koschowitz, a graduate student at the University's Steinmann Institute for Geology, Mineralogy and Paleontology, said in a written statement. “I was never really convinced by any of these theories."
Instead, the study suggests plumage evolved in dinosaurs because its bright coloration facilitated communication and mate selection.
Koschowitz and her team came up with the idea after analyzing genetic similarities between dinosaurs and modern-day reptiles and birds. The analysis led them to hypothesize that dinosaurs had "tetrachromatic" vision -- in other words, they had photo receptors to detect ultraviolet light as well as blue, green, and red.
"If you look at a cladogram (tree of life) for a group of animals for which the relationships are well known and you find a feature that is shared by all of them, it's pretty safe to assume that this feature was present at the base of the tree and kept throughout the evolution of the last common ancestor into the different species," Koschowitz told The Huffington Post. "So I looked at the morphology and general color vision in reptilia and birds and lo and behold, it turned out that tetrachromacy is present in every single branch of todays reptiles."
This means dinosaurs likely used visual signals to communicate with each other, Koschowitz said. Developing large, sheet-like feathers would have resulted in a huge variety of colors and patterns they could use to recognize one another -- and mate.
The research was published online on Oct. 24 in the journal Science.

U.S. Creates 214 000 Jobs In October; Unemployment Rate Falls To 5.8 PercentU.S. Creates 214,000 Jobs In October; Unemployment Rate Falls To 5.8 Percent
Posted:
The U.S. economy added 214,000 jobs in October, as the unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.
More from the AP:
WASHINGTON (AP) — Three days after voters registered their sourness about the U.S. economy, the government said Friday that employers added a solid 214,000 jobs in October, extending the healthiest pace of hiring in eight years.
The Labor Department also said a combined 31,000 more jobs were added in August and September than it had previously estimated. Employers have now added at least 200,000 jobs for nine straight months — the longest such stretch since 1995.
The burst of hiring lowered the unemployment rate to 5.8 percent from 5.9 percent. It is the lowest rate since July 2008. Yet workers' average hourly pay rose only slightly, a glaring weak spot in an otherwise solid report.
Voters identified the economy as their top concern in Tuesday's elections. That suggested that economic improvement hasn't yet been felt by many Americans. The sluggish pace of pay growth is a likely factor.
Average hourly pay rose 3 cents in October to $24.57. That's just 2 percent higher than the average wage was 12 months earlier and is barely ahead of the 1.7 percent inflation rate.
"While the labor market is improving and in many respects has already healed, employee bargaining power remains virtually nonexistent," Dan Greenhaus, an analyst at the brokerage firm BTIG LLC, said in a research note.
Still, the brightening jobs picture led more people to start looking for work last month. The percentage of Americans who either have a job or are looking for one rose in October to 62.8 percent. And 267,000 people who had been out of work said they were now employed. Their hiring reduced the number of unemployed to just under 9 million.
The job gains were broad-based, though many lower-paying industries posted especially large increases. Retailers added 27,100 jobs. Restaurants, hotels and entertainment firms gained 52,000.
Some higher-paying industries also showed progress. Manufacturers added 15,000 jobs, up from 9,000 the previous month. Transportation and shipping companies gained 13,300. And professional and business services, which includes accountants, engineers and other higher-skilled fields, added 37,000.
Analysts say the economic expansion remains strong enough to support the current pace of hiring. Over the past six months, the economy has grown at a 4.1 percent annual rate.
U.S. manufacturers are expanding at the fastest pace in three years, according to a survey by the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group. A measure of new orders showed that factory output will likely continue to grow in coming months. A separate survey by the ISM found that retailers, restaurants and other service companies grew at a healthy pace last month.
Home sales rose in September at their fastest rate this year, a sign that housing could pick up after a sluggish performance for most of this year.
Still, faltering global growth could create trouble for the U.S. economy in the months ahead. Exports fell in September, the government said this week, widening the trade deficit. That led many economists to shave their predictions of economic growth in the July-September quarter to an annual rate of 3 percent or less, down from the government's initial estimate of 3.5 percent.

Automatically Generated Transcript (may not be 100% accurate)
00:02  So one of the things that happen particularly in the
00:04  Rust Belt during the recession as you had several cities that
00:08  were already in very bad shape so compared to the nation's
00:11  unemployment for example was horrible. They've got much worst in the
00:15  nation as a whole as you went into the trough of
00:18  the recession and then for these comebacks in these. They rose
00:22  very quickly and in some cases match the recovery of the
00:25  country as a whole so the three really big. Come back
00:28  cities during a bit of the crescent around Detroit there Indianapolis.
00:32  Battle Creek and Coca mile. And if you look at these
00:36  two which you've got is an unemployment rate in Indianapolis. That.
00:41  Killed eleven point 3%. In its now down to six point
00:44  1%. In Battle Creek it's dropped from eleven point five to
00:49  five point five. And in Kokomo it's really a huge slide
00:53  it's fourteen point 5% to five point 7%. Over the period
00:58  from the trough of the recession. To this last August. But
01:03  what you have here for the most part is cities that
01:06  are directly related to Detroit which as we all know. Went
01:10  bankrupt many of these places where feeders for auto parts for
01:14  services. Some of them have auto plants and them. So as
01:18  you had and GM and Chrysler going to Chapter Eleven. And
01:22  in essence strip out a lot of costs these cities for
01:25  the most part were badly damaged by the recovery in these
01:29  cities. This to some extent based on the fact that they're
01:33  fairly small. So you may open a plan to a new
01:36  business might move then. If you had an employment population that's
01:40  250000. People. You don't have to add a lot of jobs
01:45  for that unemployment rate to drops significantly most of these jobs
01:49  we're because of some resurgence in manufacturing. It may not always
01:53  have been automotive related manufacturing. But for the most part it
01:57  was jobs and factories. And related industries. That pushed these things
02:02  back up one of the things that's common to most of
02:05  these come back cities' is that. A lot of the jobs
02:08  that were lost were high wage jobs income some case unionized
02:12  jobs. So the amount people were paid per hour was high
02:16  the benefits were high. Once those companies were wiped out or
02:20  downsized a lot of good jobs came back and we're jobs
02:25  for people work part time or with long benefits are lower
02:28  hourly wages so for most of these cities unemployment will continue
02:32  to be relatively. The question for them is though will there
02:36  ever be a lot of high quality jobs that come back.
02:39  The kind of jobs that allow people to make 405060000. Dollars
02:44  a year. And household income. And for most of these cities
02:47  that isn't true right now so ultimately this is not just
02:51  a story about unemployment it's also a story about wages and
02:55  for cities to recover. By a large margin they need to
02:59  have a recovery of both of those factors.

The Great Recession was hard on most of the country, but few areas were hit harder than the rust belt. Since the end of the recession, however, many of the region's cities have rallied, adding jobs as their economies improve.
Based on a review of data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 24/7 Wall St. identified five cities that had some of the worst unemployment rates before and during the recession but also some of the most dramatic recoveries in recent years.
As recently as 2010, the unemployment rates in these five cities were exceptionally high, even when compared to the national unemployment rate of nearly 10%. In Muskegon, Michigan, for example, 13.5% of the workforce was unemployed in 2010, among the worst rates in the nation. In Kokomo, Indiana, the unemployment rate exceeded 12%.
As of August, however, the unemployment rates of all of these cities were less than or equal to the national unemployment rate of 6.1%. In Kokomo, the unemployment rate was 5.7%, or 8.8 percentage points lower than its former peak rate. Similarly, the unemployment rate in Indianapolis fell from a high of 11.3% in 2010 to just 6.1% this August.
These metro areas have also had a broad resurgence in economic activity. Nationwide, economic output fell by 1.9% between 2006 and 2009 and rebounded by 8.2% from 2009 through last year. By comparison, real gross metropolitan product (GMP) in Toledo, Ohio fell by 6.5% from 2006 through 2009, and rose by 9.4% in the four years that followed. No metro area has had larger swings in economic output than Kokomo. From 2006 to 2009, Kokomo's GMP shrank at a compounded annual rate of more than 15%, or by a total of more than 40% in that time. From 2009 to 2013, however, Kokomo's GMP rose at a compounded annual rate of roughly 12.7% — for a total increase of more than 61%.
One major reason for the resurgence in these areas has been a growth in manufacturing jobs. From 2009 to 2013, manufacturing employment in Toledo and Indianapolis rose by more than 9%. In Kokomo, employment in the sector was up 7% in that time. A number of developments in recent years have contributed to manufacturing growth. For one, President Barack Obama has championed manufacturing through the White House's Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, which aims to foster innovation and improve the business climate for manufacturers. Another development was the drop in natural gas prices, which has lowered manufacturing costs for a broad range of products.
The revitalization of the car industry has also been a boon to most of these cities. Each of the five metro areas reviewed is located in one of three states: Indiana, Michigan, or Ohio. All of these states are home to a large number of automotive industry jobs. According to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing some of the largest carmakers in the industry, nearly 22% of Michigan's job force works for an automaker, supplier, or dealer. In Ohio and Indiana, 12.4% and 13.9% of workers do, respectively. These three states alone account for nearly a third of all automotive sector jobs in the U.S.
To determine the five metro areas that are back from the dead, 24/7 Wall St. looked at unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). To be considered, a metro area had to have an unemployment rate of at least 6.0% in 2006, or roughly 30% above the national average. By 2010, unemployment must have risen to at least 11% before recovering to an unemployment rate equal to or below the national average of 6.1% in August. The labor force also could not have contracted more than 2.8% between 2010 and 2014. We reviewed average weekly wages by metro area through August 2014. For job growth data, we used three month moving averages.
In addition to BLS figures, we reviewed annual economic output data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis through 2013. From the U.S. Census Bureau, we looked at median home values, educational attainment, poverty rates, and the percent of employees by industry. Census Bureau data are as of 2013.
Here are five cities that are back from the dead.
Toledo, Ohio
> Decline from peak: 6.6 percentage points
> Peak unemployment: 12.2%
> Unemployment, August: 5.6%
> GMP change, 2009-2013: 9.4%
Toledo's unemployment rate rose by more than six percentage points between 2006 and 2009, peaking at 12.2%. By comparison, the national unemployment rate rose 4.7 percentage points over the same period, from 4.6% to 9.3% . As unemployment rose, economic output fell. In fact, GMP dropped by more than 6.5% between 2006 and 2009, well below the nation's 1.9% decline. However, the unemployment rate in Toledo soon began to fall. In August, just 5.6% of the metro area's labor force was unemployed, making Toledo's drop in unemployment rate one of the largest in the country over that period.
Toledo's recovery is likely attributable to the rebound in manufacturing jobs. In 2009, nearly one in 10 manufacturing jobs was lost. But since 2011, manufacturing employment growth has hovered near 2% annually. The return of manufacturing jobs also helps explain the 17.9% increase in average weekly wages between 2010 and 2013. By 2013, manufacturing workers in Toledo earned nearly twice as much as average manufacturing employee in the U.S., on average. However, many Toledo residents are still struggling. In 2013 19.5% of residents lived below the poverty line, nearly four percentage points above the national rate of 15.8%.

Invincible India clinch seriesMore
Dhawan, Kohli set up India series win
Shikhar Dhawan missed out on a second hundred in the series, but his 79-ball 91 and skipper Virat Kohli's half-century were enough for India to comfortably chase down Sri Lanka's 242 at Hyderabad.

India 245 for 4 (Dhawan 91, Kohli 53) beat Sri Lanka 242 (Jayawardene 118, Dilshan 53, Yadav 4-53, Akshar 3-40) by six wickets
Scorecard and ball-by-ball details
Pacer Umesh yadav picked up four wickets in Sri Lanka's uninspiring innings.
Akshar Patel is perhaps chief among them: He removed three batsmen through the middle overs, while Umesh Yadav struck at either end of the innings to earn a career-best haul of 4 for 53.
Sri Lanka at least had one batsman make triple figures during their innings of 242, but Mahela Jayawardene took little visible joy in his effortless 118 off 124, as a string of team-mates abandoned him during the middle overs. Jayawardene became the fifth batsman to 12000 career runs during the knock, before Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli hit half-centuries to notch career milestones of their own, in India's innings. Kohli became the fastest batsmen to 6000 ODI runs in his 136th innings, while Dhawan became the quickest India batsman to 2000 runs, in his 48th knock.
It had been Akshar, however, who made the most telling play of the game, taking a wicket in each of his three Powerplay overs to gut the visitors' middle order. As has been the case throughout the series, it was his fluctuations in pace that vexed Sri Lanka.
Angelo Mathews had appeared settled when the Powerplay was called for in the 31st over. He had reverse-swept R Ashwin powerfully for four a few balls before, but was slow on the pull as Akshar skidded one through and the top edge looped to cover.
Akshar's flat, fast deliveries in the next over kept Ashan Priyanjan scoreless for four balls, before the mistake was induced. The batsman aimed a heave over mid-on, but managed only to hit it to Yadav, who took a diving catch. Chaturanga de Silva, playing this match instead of Suraj Randiv , attempted to carve Akshar over cover in the final over of the Powerplay. When he found the fielder, Sri Lanka had slipped from 144 for 3 to 154 for 6. Thisara Perera 's wicket two overs later, embedded them in further strife.
Even before the crumble in the Powerplay, Jayawardene had to launch a rescue effort alongside Tillakaratne Dilshan. The pair rebuilt sagely from 7 for 2 as Jayawardene reverted to perhaps the safest version of his own game by collecting his first boundary via a ramp over the keeper's head, played sinfully late. Eleven of his 12 fours were scored behind the wicket, and 80 of his 118 made in the same region.
Dilshan scrambled a fifty, but Jayawardene's next four partners lasted 11.2 overs put together, and soon, having lost faith in his team-mates, Jayawardene was turning down singles into the outfield as early as in the 38th over. Seekkuge Prasanna was put down by Suresh Raina in the slips on 0 and provided Jayawardene slightly better company after that, sticking around for a partnership of 67 before Jayawardene was stummped of an Ashwin top-spinner. The innings would soon wipe out in the 49th over, with about 60 fewer runs on the scoreboard than what might have made for an interesting chase on a flat Hyderabad pitch.
Sri Lanka had recalled Nuwan Kulasekara for this match, but he could find little swing early on, and India's batsmen quickly settled into a now familiar routine. They laid low for the first few overs, waited for the seam to grow soft, then began to play their strokes. Ajinkya Rahane fell to Thisara Perera 's prolonged short-ball attack, but Dhawan and Rayudu picked up the pace quickly after that, ensuring 62 for 1 was as weak as India's chase would look.
Dhawan had hit his third successive fifty, and the visitors' attack had been rendered virtually toothless when the India batsmen contrived a run out in the 25th over - a seething Rayudu having to make the trek back on 35, after Dhawan failed to respond to his call for a quick single. Kohli then arrived and settled in with ease from there, hitting some superbly timed boundaries, particularly when the bowlers strayed too full.
Dhawan looked set for a second ton in the series until he got a bad decision on 91, when a Kulasekara short-ball took a deflection off his helmet, rather than his bat. Kohli though, breezed ahead at a run-a-ball, raising his 31st ODI fifty and his 6000th run with the same stroke. He was caught at the fence for 53 trying to close out the chase in a hurry, but Wriddhiman Saha hit the winning runs soon after, with 35 balls still remaining.

Coal scam: CBI does a U-turn on Birla  Parakh closure reportCoal scam: CBI now says enough evidence to take cognisance against Birla, Parakh
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 15:46 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
In an apparent U-turn, CBI, which had filed a closure report in a coal blocks case involving industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla, former coal secretary P C Parakh and others, on Monday told a special court there was enough evidence against the accused to take cognisance of offences.
The Supreme court appointed-special public prosecutor (SPP) R S Cheema submitted before Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar that the court can take cognisance on the closure report filed by it on October 21 as there was prima facie "evidence against the accused to show their involvement".
The court after hearing the submissions advanced by Cheema and CBI prosecutors V K Sharma and A P Singh fixed the matter for November 25 for consideration of the agency's closure report.
"SPP states that under the facts and circumstances of the case, prima facie there is enough material to take cognisance of the offences against private parties and some of the government officials involved in the process of coal blocks allocation. Put up for consideration on the closure report on November 25," the judge said.
The CBI also placed on record a compilation of relevant documents relating to the case.
During the hearing, Cheema said, "We are asking for cognisance on the closure report as there was evidence against the accused to show their involvement."
The judge asked the prosecutor that if the court decides to take cognisance of the offences, will the agency be ready with its documents.
To this, Cheema said some further investigation was required in the matter.
Earlier, on October 21, CBI had filed a "detailed and comprehensive" revised final closure report before the court in the case.
The FIR against Birla, Parakh and others was registered in October last year by CBI which had alleged that Parakh had reversed his decision to reject coal block allocation to Hindalco within months "without any valid basis or change in circumstances" and shown "undue favours".
The FIR relates to allocation of Talabira II and III coal blocks in 2005.
On September 12, the court had asked CBI what was the hurry in closing the case in which FIR was registered against Birla, Parakh and others after it first filed the closure report on August 28.
CBI had booked Birla, Parakh and other officials of Hindalco under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct on the part of government officials.
In its FIR, the agency had alleged that during the 25th Screening Committee meeting, chaired by Parakh, applications of Hindalco and Indal Industries were rejected for mining in Talabira II and III "citing valid reasons".

US-Iran nuclear deal: Obama faces last best chance to curb Iran s nuke programPrint

By: Associated Press | Muscat | Posted: November 10, 2014 12:03 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 12:15 pm
The Obama administration is facing its last best chance to curb Iran’s nuclear program — not just to meet an end-of-the-month deadline for a deal, but also to seal one before skeptical Republicans who will control Congress next year are able to scuttle it.
Years of negotiations to limit Tehran’s nuclear production entered the final stretch Sunday as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and European Union senior adviser Catherine Ashton in Oman’s capital. With no immediate agreement in sight, officials said the discussions were expected to continue into Monday.
The stakes are high as the Nov. 24 deadline approaches. A deal could quell Mideast fears about Iran’s ability to build a nuclear bomb and help revive the Islamic Republic’s economy.
It also would deliver a foreign policy triumph for the White House, which is being hammered by prominent Republican senators over its handling of the civil war in Syria and the growth of the Islamic State militancy in Iraq. Those same critics seek to put the brakes on U.S.-Iranian bartering, if not shut it down completely, once they seize the majority on Jan. 3.
The Obama administration “needs to understand that this Iranian regime cares more about trying to weaken America and push us out of the Middle East than cooperating with us,” Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona, the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said in a statement last week.
President Barack Obama told CBS’ “Face The Nation” that his administration’s “unprecedented sanctions” on Iran are what forced Tehran to the negotiating table. “Our number one priority with respect to Iran is making sure they don’t get a nuclear weapon,” he said.
But Obama also cited “a big gap” between Iran and world powers as they try for a final agreement. “We may not be able to get there,” he said in the interview broadcast Sunday.
Over the past year, congressional Republicans have made little secret of their skepticism of Obama’s outreach to Tehran. They say it has alienated Israel and kept the U.S. from maintaining a hard line on a number of foreign policy fronts, including Iran’s detention of three continued…

Man pays premium charge for park-facing home  gets artificial grass carpetComments
Shankar Sanghi (name changed) wanted a grass carpet welcome when he decided to move into his apartment in Noida Extension. Accordingly, he paid a preferential location charge of Rs. 100 per sq ft while booking the home four years ago.
While checking out his unit being readied for possession a few days ago, Sanghi was shocked to see artificial grass instead of the lush green park he had paid for. Today, he feels conned.
"I had paid the additional charge for an apartment that faced a park but have got a green carpet instead. It may be a cost cutting measure on the part of the developer, but it now needs to be seen if I will want to pay monthly maintenance for a fake green strip instead of a garden."
According to a Delhi-based architect, a grass carpet is relatively easy to maintain and costs between Rs. 100 and Rs. 150 per sq ft, while a real garden with waterproofing etc costs between Rs. 300 to Rs. 500 per sq ft.
 
If Sanghi decides to drag the developer to court for fraud, he has a case, according to a legal expert.
"This is an absolute hoax. A builder cannot possibly presume that a buyer is so gullible that he will pay preferential location charges for a fake grass carpet instead of a park-facing apartment. This amounts to fraud and consumers have a remedy available under the law," said Vaibhav Gaggar of Gaggar&Associates.
Sanghi has to make the call now, but the developer may be banking on the possibility that he will not have the time, energy and money to pursue the case and put up with what he has been offered.
This kind of belief on the part of a builder is not unheard of or uncommon.
Close to Sanghi's apartment, another builder has pulled a fast one on his customers. The builder had initially sold the project with six swimming pools being the unique selling proposition. It has now been reduced to one.
These gaps between and promises and delivery are in line with usual stories of additional floors being constructed on top of what was pitched as a penthouse at the time of booking and new towers coming up on land initially projected as a park.

The house in Flint, Mich.

Flint, Mich., was one of the hardest hit cities before and during the recession. Once one of the state's largest cities, and a prosperous one when auto production plants were there, it came under the control of an emergency manager, appointed by the governor, during two periods, long before Detroit did. While Detroit may be the home of the $1,000 house, one home in Flint is on the market for $188.
The house does not have much to recommend it. Located at 2518 Dakota Ave., it only covers 1,225 square feet, which accommodates three bedrooms and a single bath. It sits on a lot of just 5,663 square feet. The house was built in 1928, before the Great Depression.
The listing of the house on Realtor.com says it is a:
"Fixer Upper Home, Needs lots of work, has major fire damage, seller selling AS IS"
MORE: States where poverty is worse than you think
If Flint's government could afford it, the house might be a candidate to be bulldozed into the ground to make way for a flat field that might be used for a garden, or for nothing at all. The house sits in a neighborhood with similar homes, just off Michigan's Route 59 and not far from I-475, as if anyone might drive there.
Flint's population peaked at over 196,000 in 1960, according to the Census, and fell under 99,000 last year. The median household income in Flint is just above $27,000, compared to the national average of just over $51,000.
The economy is so badly broken that the local Flint newspaper, the Flint Journal, is only published three times a week.
Most cities battered by the recession and the collapse of the car industry have some chance of coming back. Not so for Flint. According to a Detroit Free Press evaluation of Flint:
Thirty years ago, it was the home of 14,000 workers, a sprawling complex of factories that churned out millions of auto parts a day for General Motors Corp.
By 2005, the city had almost been destroyed as more and more manufacturing moved away. The number of auto workers has fallen close to zero.
Is a house for sale for $188 even imaginable to most Americans? It might be when one around the corner is on the market for $210.

"There's been class warfare going on for the last 20 years, and my class has won."
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett made that remark more than three years ago and it still holds true today — only the gap between the richest and the poorest has gotten even wider.
Here's how bad it is: Oxfam now calculates that the 85 richest billionaires on the planet, including the likes of Carlos Slim, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, have as much money as the 3.5 billion poorest people.
And for all the talk about the urgent need to address income inequality, the mega-rich just keep on getting richer.
How much richer?
Oxfam estimates that between March 2013 and March 2014, those same 85 billionaires saw their wealth grow by $668 million every day.
These people are so grotesquely rich that if Bill Gates, for example, spent $1 million every day, it would take him 218 years to exhaust his funds.
That, of course, would never happen because Gates would be earning millions of dollars a day in interest on the rest of his wealth.
When you have more money than you could possibly spend in several lifetimes, you can afford to do some pretty crazy things.
Like spend $95,000 on a 4 lb white truffle that looks like a turd because when your name is Vladimir Potanin, the Russian mining tycoon, and you have a net worth of $13.9 billion, $95,000 is pocket change.
Much ink has been spilled about the widening gap between the richest and the poorest, and about what it means for the global economic outlook, and yet, extreme inequality persists.
And while some argue that more should be done to help people at the bottom, rather than attack those at the top, former US Department of Health and Human Services assistant secretary Peter Edelman said it was time for the rich to pay up.
"I used to believe," Edelman said in his book "So Rich, So Poor," "that the debate over wealth distribution should be conducted separately from the poverty debate, in order to minimize the attacks on antipoverty advocates for engaging in 'class warfare.' But now we literally cannot afford to separate the two issues."
The "economic and political power of those at the top," Edelman said, is "making it virtually impossible to find the resources to do more at the bottom.
"The only way we will improve the lot of the poor, stabilize the middle class, and protect our democracy is by requiring the rich to pay more of the cost of governing the country that enables their huge accretion of wealth."
Don't hold your breath.

Give people a penny for their thoughts, and they're likely to open up about their financial problems. Money issues weigh heavily on the minds of many.
Some 71% of Americans have financial worries, and 31% of them say their biggest concern is a lack of savings, according to a recent survey of 2,016 adults conducted for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling . In fact, 34% say they have no non-retirement savings. Only 39% of people have a budget and track spending.
USA WEEKEND worked with the NFCC to identify three families who need a "money makeover." Here's a look at those folks and how a credit-counseling expert is helping them improve their financial situations. We'll check in with them in the spring to update their progress.

ITC Shares Gain on Hopes of  Acche Din  AheadYou are here: Home Market
ITC Gains on Change of Guard in Health Ministry
NDTV | Updated On: November 10, 2014 15:49 (IST)
Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
Shares in cigarette manufacturer ITC jumped 2.5 per cent on Monday as traders said the removal of Dr Harsh Vardhan from the Health Ministry is a positive for the tobacco industry. Dr Harsh Vardhan was shifted to the more low-key Science and Technology and Earth Sciences Ministry in the Cabinet reshuffle announced on Sunday.
ITC, which is the most influential stock in the Nifty, was among the top gainers in morning trade and helped the blue chip index register a record high in morning trade. The stock has underperformed the broader markets over the last six months because of a clamp down on the tobacco industry.
Over the last five months, Dr Harsh Vardhan took several steps to curb India's tobacco consumption. Taxes on tobacco products have gone up and companies have been ordered to print more health warnings on packages. Recently, the Health Ministry was also considering a ban on electronic cigarettes and sale of single conventional cigarettes. While most e-cigarettes are imported and sold by small firms, India's largest cigarette maker ITC started selling the devices in August.
Indians smoked more than 100 billion cigarettes in 2012, according to Euromonitor International, and it is common for vendors to sell them individually. A single cigarette costs about Rs. 10 in Delhi as compared with a pack of 20 that costs Rs. 190.
ITC shares have gained just 0.6 per cent in the last six months as compared to a 17 per cent gain in the broader Sensex over the same period. Now, there is hope for the stock. Market analyst TS Harihar said ITC could gain 5-10 per cent in the short term.
Political commentator Sudheendra Kulkarni told NDTV that Dr Harsh Vardhan was an ideal person to head the Health Ministry, so his removal was surprising.
"He took many initiatives... The anti-tobacco campaign is extremely important to take on the threat of cancer in India," he said.
Up to 9 lakh Indians die every year of tobacco-related diseases, and that number could reach 1.5 million by 2020 if users do not kick the habit, the International Tobacco Control Project estimates.
ITC shares ended  4.08 per cent higher at Rs 370.15 apiece on Monday and was also the top gainer in Nifty. However, other tobacco companies such as Godfrey Philips and VST Industries ended with losses of 4.3 per cent and 0.45 per cent respectively.

Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 10, 2014 13:59 (IST)
Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
New Delhi: Auto components firm Bharat Forge today reported an 81 per cent jump in its standalone net profit at Rs 174.49 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014 on the back of robust export growth.
The company's net profit stood at Rs 96.38 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal, Bharat Forge said in a filing to the BSE.
Total sales of the company in the July-September quarter of FY 2014-15 stood at Rs 1,138.27 crore, up 34.68 per cent from Rs 845.11 crore during the same period a year ago.
"Q2 FY15 performance has been better than expected on the back of continued robust export growth, in particular from North American Industrial and Commercial Vehicle market," Bharat Forge CMD B N Kalyani said.
He further added: "Leveraging our in-house R&D and Innovation capabilities, we developed new products and technologies enabling us to win our maiden order from SAFRAN and two other global OEM's in the Aerospace sector for supply of mission critical forgings."
On the outlook, Kalyani said demand would improve across all segment with volumes.
"We expect North America demand to increase while Europe is expected to soften a bit. We expect the domestic industrial sector to increase in the next two quarters largely driven by 'Make in India' initiatives of the Government of India," he said.
For the first half of 2014-15, the company's standalone net profit increased 70.85 per cent to Rs 319.46 crore as compared to Rs 186.98 crore in the same period last year.
Bharat Forge's net sales during the six-month period increased 29.92 per cent to Rs 2,126.40 crore as against Rs 1,636.67 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal.
Shares of Bharat Forge were trading at Rs 869.45 per scrip, up 3.90 per cent from their previous close on the BSE in the afternoon trade.

India Inc Sees Promise of Accelerated Reforms in Cabinet Expansion
Reuters | Updated On: November 10, 2014 10:21 (IST)
FDA Criticises Quality Control, Training at Wockhardt US Plant
New Delhi: The larger union cabinet has been welcomed by business groups impatient for the Narendra Modi government to fulfil campaign pledges to get the economy out of a long slowdown by fixing India's power crisis and overloaded infrastructure.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Modi appointed a separate defence minister in Former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar to spur military modernization and free Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to focus on the budget and reforms to revive the economy.
"The cabinet expansion sends out a strong signal that the government under Prime Minister Modi is serious about accelerating the reforms process," said Ajay Shriram, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry.
Mr Jaitley had run both defence and finance since Mr Modi took office six months ago, leading to criticism that neither of the key departments could be properly led.
Even though PM Modi relieved Mr Jaitley of defence, the media-savvy lawyer will still have to juggle three ministries, since he now has the additional portfolio of information and broadcasting.
Including junior ministers, Mr Modi added a total of 21 new names into his team including one woman - bringing to eight the number of women in his 65-strong council of ministers.
Jayant Sinha, a Harvard Business School graduate and investment fund manager who is the son of former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, was brought in as a junior to Mr Jaitley.
The expansion went some way towards addressing Mr Modi's reliance on a small group of overworked ministers, but several posts remain vacant.
Mr Jaitley was hospitalised for several weeks in August and September after an operation to treat diabetes. Doctors blamed his workload for delaying his recovery. The opposition Congress party had criticized Mr Modi for turning defence and finance into "part-time jobs."
An ambitious $9.5 billion (Rs 57,950 crore, $1 = Rs 61) privatisation target is well behind schedule, partly because of delays in getting a new team in place in the finance ministry. Mr Jaitley now has a new bench of officials in the ministry, including one of the world's leading economists, Arvind Subramanian, as an adviser.
Together they must revive investment, growth and job creation; the country adds some 10 million people to the workforce every year. The next budget is due in February and investors are hoping for bold decisions on the economy.
"Some reforms are easily possible, some are possible with a consensus, and some are more challenging. I have clearly prioritised most of them...and for the next few months we have our plates reasonably full," Mr Jaitley said on Sunday.
The government has so far taken a series of steps to make life easier for businesses and has reduced subsidies on fuel, spurring a rally in stocks and bond markets after the longest period of low growth since the 1980s. But investment in the economy has not picked up, and industrial output is flat.

Sena-BJP row: Some problems take care of themselves  says JaitleyLetters to  the editor
Amid simmering tension with Sena which appears to be on verge of parting ways with BJP over a spat on Cabinet expansion, Union Minister Arun Jaitley today said some problems take care of themselves.
As he took over as the Information and Broadcasting minister, Jaitley, who already holds charge of the Finance Ministry, said the problem would be solved and stressed that some problems find their own solution.
“Some problems take care of themselves,” he said when asked by reporters about the BJP-Shiv Sena row.
Sena-BJP ties hit a new low in the wake of a spat over Cabinet expansion at the Centre and failure to accommodate the Sena in the Maharashtra government in Mumbai.
Sena MP Anil Desai not taking oath as Union Minister yesterday and the induction of Suresh Prabhu, who had been in the Shiv Sena as Cabinet Minister, had added to the growing chasm between the friends-turned-foes.
The simmering tension between them came to a boil yesterday as Desai left for Mumbai from Delhi airport without attending the swearing-in ceremony.
Desai had returned to Mumbai on orders of Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray whose party accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi as also the BJP of a host of broken promises and heaping “humiliation after humiliation” on it.
Union Minister Anant Geete is the lone Shiv Sena representative in the Union Cabinet and the developments could culminate in his being asked by the Sena leadership to quit the government.
Speaking to reporters, Jaitley, who took over as the Information and Broadcasting minister from Prakash Javadekar, said it is through the Information and Broadcasting ministry that communication of the Government and its ministries is done.
Referring to his previous stint in the I&B ministry, Jaitley said the domain of the media has now expanded immensely.
“I have been in this ministry before, there was more print media than electronic media. Today, there has been a lot of growth of the radio and digital mediums.
“There was a time, when the major work of this ministry was Doordarshan and All India Radio. It is still a major area, but this changed information process scenario, this ministry has to look at that,” he said.
Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, who joined as Minister of State in the ministry, said there was perceived to be a communication gap between the government and the media, and only “one way communication” was taking place.
“I think one of the most important thing for this government after it came was to take immediate and important steps to put the economy and national prestige and security on track. And hence perhaps you get the impression that the communication was a little stifled. However, that is not the intention at all.
“With Arunji here and with myself as MoS, we’ll make all efforts to be available to you and all sorts of two way communication, as you refer, will be there,” he said.
Rathore was also asked by reporters to explain the expanded size of the Council of Ministers when the government itself had been talking about minimum government and maximum governance and synergy.
He said minimum government and maximum governance is a concept and an attitude that the Prime Minister wants all in the government to have.
“Numbers are symbolical. Right in the beginning when we said that with lesser ministers, we are giving lesser interference, it is symbolic. Now when the policies have been decided, direction for the whole nation has been decided, to implement those policies, we need larger number of people in the ministries and yet it will still remain minimum government because interference is going to be limited,” he said.
The minister said the idea is to be a catalyst in the progress of the nation.
Asked for his focus area in the ministry, he said the “vision of the Prime Minister” is the objective and the target.
Rathore was also asked as to whether there will be a greater projection of sports as he himself has been an ace sportsman.
“I think every medium, every sector, every field where there is skill, where there is any Indian doing well needs to be projected, whichever medium that is,” he said.

Six out of 10 Indian menadmit violence against wives: UN studyComments
Six out of 10 men in India admit to having perpetrated violence against their wives or partners, with men who experienced discrimination as children or faced financial stresses more likely to be abusive, said a study released on Monday.
The report, by the United Nations World Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Washington-based International Center for Research on Women, polled 9,205 men, aged 18 to 49, across seven states to understand their views on masculinity, partner violence and son preference.
Violence was defined as emotional such as insults, intimidation and threats, or physical and sexual such as pushing, punching and rape. It also included economic abuse in which a man did not permit his wife or partner to work or took her earnings against her will.
"Many men in India act in a manner that is fairly predetermined by their gendered roles and expectations, socio-economic characteristics and childhood experiences," said the 'Masculinity, Intimate Partner Violence and Son Preference' report.
"Men who experience economic stress were more likely to have perpetrated violence ever or in the past 12 months. This may be because of norms related to masculinity, which reinforce the expectation that men are primary economic providers for their households."
The study - across the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra - found that men who had experienced discrimination as children were four times more likely to be violent towards their partners.
The highest reports of violence came from Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, said the report, with more than 70% of men in these regions admitting to being abusive towards their wives and partners.
More than 38% of all crimes committed against women in India in 2013 were those registered under the charge of cruelty by husband or his relatives, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).
Such crimes make up the largest proportion of crimes against women in the country - with 118,866 cases of cruelty by husband or his family reported from a total of 309,546, says the NCRB.
Physical violence most common
The study, which also polled 3,158 women, said more than half (52%) of women said they had experienced some form of violence during their lifetime.
Physical abuse such as being kicked, slapped, choked and burned was the most commonly reported, with 38% of women saying they had faced such abuse. This was followed by emotional, sexual and economic violence respectively.
The reason less women reported being victims than men  reported being violent was a feeling of shame or fear of social stigma, said the report. They may have also believed such acts were normal in a relationship and expected men to exert some control on their lives, it added.
Women who were discriminated against as children were three to six times more likely to experience violence.
"Women who experienced and observed discrimination or violence growing up are more likely to justify it as adults and may therefore not resist circumstances that may trigger intimate partner violence," the report said.
The head of UNFPA in India, Frederika Meijer, said that this research into the causes of violence would help to structure programmes to engage men and boys more effectively.
"It identifies triggers that could enable them to become change agents in addressing gender discrimination," Meijer said at the launch of the report on the sidelines of the MenEngage conference aimed at getting men involved in gender equality.

New Delhi, Nov 10:  
The mutual fund industry’s assets under management (AUM) climbed to record high of nearly Rs 11 lakh crore in October on the back of strong capital inflows and surge in equity markets.
The country’s 45 fund houses together had an average AUM of Rs 10,95,653 crore at the end of October 31, 2014, up from Rs 9,59,415 crore in the preceding month, according to the data by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).
The AUM data for individual fund house is not being disclosed.
Industry experts said the monthly rise in AUM is largely on account of gains in equity markets and strong capital inflows. Besides, retail participation in equity schemes has increased significantly during the recent months.
The fund houses together witnessed an inflow of Rs 1.24 lakh crore. During the month, the benchmark BSE Sensex grew by over 1,200 points or nearly five per cent.
The assets managed by mutual funds had crossed Rs 10 lakh crore—mark for the first time in May, when the markets went up after the General Elections’ result.

Shiv Sena to sit in Opposition inMaharashtraPrint
Sena-BJP ties hit a new low in the wake of a spat over Cabinet expansion at the Centre and failure to accommodate the Sena in the Maharashtra government in Mumbai.
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 6:26 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 9:30 pm
The Shiv Sena on Monday staked claim to the leader of opposition post in the Maharashtra Assembly, but maintained that it was still open to talks with the BJP. “While we are firm on staking claim to opposition leader role, we are not denying the possibility of holding talks with BJP. We are always ready for a dialogue with BJP,” Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray said.
The Sena’s flip-flop in the Assembly and outside seemed to suggest a divide within the organisation, with several MLAs still urging Thackeray not to take an extreme stand against the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in the state.
Though Sena’s MLAs occupied opposition benches in the Assembly on Monday morning, the discomfort was visible on their faces.
The Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, submitted an official letter to the state legislature assembly secretariat, claiming its right for the leader of opposition post as it is the second-largest party in the state with 63 MLAs. In the 288-member house, BJP currently has 121 MLAs, the Congress has 42 and the NCP has 41.
Sena’s Member of Legislative Council Neelam Gorhe announced, “We have submitted the letter to stake claim to the role of opposition leader in the Assembly.”
The legislature secretariat confirmed: “The Shiv Sena has the right to the post of opposition leader.”
However, a disgruntled MLA said on condition of anonymity, “It is strange that being the second largest party, we are in the opposition. We should have played our cards carefully to bring BJP to the negotiating table to form the government.”
A senior BJP leader confided, “Officially, talks between the Sena and BJP may have come to a standstill. But back-channel negotiations are underway. Everything will become clear on November 12.”
The BJP has held Sena responsible for taking an extreme stand by not allowing Anil Desai to join the Union cabinet on Sunday. A party source said, “BJP president Amit Shah had sought consent from Thackeray to induct Desai.” The Sena insisted that they would like to see at least two candidates inducted in the cabinet.
The source added, “The central leadership told them that since they have given only one ministerial post to alliance partner Telegu Desam Party, it would not be proper to give two posts to Sena.” However, Sena was assured that their demand for the induction of another minister would be considered in the coming days. At that point, Thackeray had agreed. But 10 minutes before the swearing-in, Thackeray reiterated his earlier demand. The BJP told him that things cannot be reworked at the last minute.
According to sources, “Thackeray urged the BJP emissary to connect him continued…

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."

Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.

Obamacare Shoppers Get Sneak Peak At New PricesObamacare Shoppers Get Sneak Peek At New Prices

Health insurance consumers using HealthCare.gov will get their first look at the prices for 2015 coverage starting Sunday night, when window shopping goes live on the website, federal officials announced Sunday.
Shoppers won't be able to choose a health plan for 2015 until Nov. 15, when the three-month enrollment period begins. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is providing early access to estimated health insurance premiums and the value of subsidies available to low- and moderate-income households. The window-shopping tool proved to be the most-visited part of HealthCare.gov during the first Obamacare enrollment period, officials said.
HealthCare.gov , which serves insurance consumers in more than 30 states , debuted Oct. 1, 2013, without the ability for people to window shop, which forced users to create accounts and begin applications for coverage before they could view prices. And since the website was barely functional for the first two months of the six-month sign-up period last year, the absence of this tool made it nearly impossible for people to gauge whether they could afford coverage -- and put greater strain on the system -- until the feature was added.
Obamacare officials said they would release an analysis of the health insurance premiums for 2015 later this week.
"We think the news is largely positive," said Kevin Counihan, the CEO of HealthCare.gov and the director of the Center for Consumer and Information and Insurance Oversight within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Independent analyses based on health insurance pricing information made public by state regulators have shown modest average premium increases for Obamacare plans across the nation. According to the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, rates will rise an average of 6 percent in states that have reported 2015 prices. The changes vary greatly, however, so some consumers will see double-digit increases while others will see prices go down if they keep their current coverage. The number of health insurers selling plans on the exchanges also is increasing by about 25 percent .
Consumers will be automatically re-enrolled into the plans they have this year if they are still being sold by their insurance carriers, but Counihan stressed that federal officials want individuals who already have coverage through the exchanges to revisit the website to ensure they're getting the best deal based on the new prices and the subsidies they can receive based on their incomes.
"The majority of our customers will be able to save money by shopping and comparing," Counihan said during a conference call with reporters Sunday. "We are strongly encouraging our customers to return back to HealthCare.gov, update their income and eligibility information, shop and compare, and see if there are better values out there for them."
Next year's prices will be available Sunday night on both HealthCare.gov and CuidadoDeSalud.gov , the Spanish-language portal to the federally run exchanges. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia operate their own exchanges and will provide premium information on their own schedules, the federal officials said.
The health insurance exchanges will open on time next Saturday, said Andy Slavitt, principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. "We've hit all the critical deadlines," he said. "We're not contemplating anything unusual or out of the ordinary, regarding Nov. 15."
The HealthCare.gov team has streamlined the application process most consumers will use, and has completed more than a month of testing to ensure the website functions this time. The website also will be able to serve more users at a time than it did during the first enrollment period.
Officials said it will be easier than it was last year for visitors to HealthCare.gov to access the window-shopping tool and view estimates of the price and benefits of plans available in their local area before this sign-up period.
Shoppers can provide their zip codes, approximate income and information about the make-up of their households to get a look at what's available and what it costs, including the effects of tax credits to reduce premiums, and subsidies to reduce out-of-pocket costs. Then users can sort health insurance plans by price and level of benefits, view information on what services are covered or not covered, and see how much they will pay when they receive medical care. When consumers find a plan they may want to purchase during the enrollment period, they can print out or email the information to themselves or save the link to that plan.

India will cross 6 pct GDP growth in 2015-16Narendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Expressing confidence that India will cross 6 per cent GDP growth in 2015-16, the new Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha today said the priority of the government will be job creation and inflation management.
“We are expecting the growth to pick up and be on the accelerating trajectory. Hopefully we will cross 6-6.5 per cent next year,” Sinha told reporters soon after taking charge.
He further said the economy will return to 7-8 per cent sustainable growth trajectory in the coming years.
The economic growth slumped to 4.7 per cent in 2013-14 and is estimated to be between 5.4-5.9 per cent in current fiscal.
The 51-year old Sinha, an IIT-Delhi and Harvard alumnus, was inducted as the Minister of State during the expansion of Union Council of Ministers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday.
Sinha also expressed hope that the government will be able to push the Insurance Bill and the Constitutional amendment bill on Goods and Services Tax (GST) during the Winter session of Parliament beginning November 24.
Referring to the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, which seeks to raise FDI cap in the sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, he said: “when it comes to Parliament we are confident that we will get the support that we require”.
As regards GST, Sinha said: “that itself has gone through years and years of preparation and consensus building … We are sure will be able to show some positive results in this session”.
On fiscal situation, he said, it was well in hand and the government is monitoring the situation very closely with respect to tax collections.
Referring to the priorities of the government, he said they have already been articulated by the Prime minister and the Finance Minister.
“First, creating jobs is very important for us and for the economy. The second area that we have emphasised and we have done well on is obviously managing inflation and price rise, which has been a major election issue and I think we have done remarkably well on that,” Sinha said, adding it was necessary to get the investment cycle moving.
Earlier, he was briefed by senior officials in the Ministry soon after taking charge. He assumes office at a time when the Ministry is preparing the Budget for 2015-16.
“We have been fortunate to have tailwinds of lower oil prices which are going to help on the expenditure side. So when we take into account we are very confident that we will be able to achieve our fiscal targets,” he said.
Sinha was elected to the Lok Sabha in May this year from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand.
His career has seen him work as an investment fund manager and management consultant.

Altman's shoes going out of business in style
After 47 years as a Loop institution, Altman's Shoes for Men will shut its doors Dec. 31. But not before the family business bids farewell to its bevy of loyal customers and finds some new ones with discounts on its inventory of thousands of new and vintage shoes.
"It's been crazy," Jackie Delott, who runs day-to-day operations, said Monday as customers squeezed in and out of the small shop at 120 W. Monroe St. "Crazy good."

Delott, who took the reins of the business from her father, Marty Altman, decided not to relocate.
"It's time to close," Delott said. "We're really happy with what we've accomplished."
The shop boasts a long line of VIPs as customers. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Rev. Jesse Jackson are regulars, Delott said. David Byrne, the Talking Heads frontman, bought a pair of black cowboy boots there.
Carlos Nieves, an employee for 25 years, said his favorite celebrity client was Tommy Lee Jones, who visited the store while in town filming "The Fugitive."
"He was a 101/2 EEE," Nieves remembered. "He got a couple of Allen Edmonds."
Altman's made its mark by carrying a wide range of sizes, from size 5 to 20 and extra-wide EEEEEE to super-narrow AAAA.
It also is known for its shoeshine stand, manned for the past 15 years by Larry Wynn, which transformed the store into a place to hang out and converse as much as shop.

Healthcare Policies and Laws Courts and the Judiciary Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) U.S. Supreme Court Barack Obama Insurance U.S. Congress
The Supreme Court will hear a legal challenge to a key part of Obamacare
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear a legal challenge to a key part of the Obamacare health law which, if successful, would deprive millions of Americans of tax-credit subsidies to help them afford health insurance coverage.
In a one-sentence order, the court said it would take up a case brought by conservative challengers of the law, the most sweeping overhaul of U.S. healthcare in decades and President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy accomplishment.
Although President Obama's healthcare law starred in tens of thousands of campaign ads, it "was not a significant vote factor" in Tuesday's election, according to one of the Republicans' most prominent polling firms. ( David Lauter )
The Supreme Court will issue a ruling by the end of June in the case, in which the plaintiffs have appealed a July ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the subsidies.
At issue is whether the subsidies - a vital component of Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, known widely as Obamacare - should be available in all 50 states, or only in some states.
Obamacare set up health insurance exchanges and a system of subsidies to help people afford insurance premiums. The plaintiffs say the language of the law restricts subsidy availability to states that run their own insurance exchanges.
8
The legal question rests on a phrase in the law that authorizes subsidies for coverage purchased via an "exchange established by the state." The battle is over whether that phrase means subsidies are not available through the federally-run exchange.
If the court found the plaintiff's interpretation to be correct, the subsidies would not be available in 36 states that lack their own health insurance exchanges. In those states, the federal government runs the exchanges.
The Obama administration remains confident that Congress wanted the subsidies to be available nationwide, said White House spokesman Josh Earnest in a statement.
cComments
@Jeff019 If no one could interpret law, we wouldn't have a court. As the court won't go around looking for anything criminal, plus it's not their job to do so. Using your analogy, if you are injured in an auto accident by a drunken driver that plowed into your car, your lawyer...

"This lawsuit reflects just another partisan attempt to undermine the Affordable Care Act and to strip millions of American families of tax credits that Congress intended for them to have," he said shortly after the Supreme Court took the case.
The share prices of major hospital chains HCA Holdings Inc , Community Health Systems Inc and Tenet Healthcare Corp closed down more than 4 percent, while shares of health insurers UnitedHealth Group, Aetna Inc and WellPoint Inc dropped nearly 3 percent.
Five million people could be affected, analysts have estimated, if the administration loses the legal fight and subsidies disappear from the federal marketplaces. In 2014, 8 million consumers signed up for healthcare via the exchanges.
Libertarian group backs case
The plaintiffs in the legal challenge are business owners and individuals who object to the law. The court's decision to hear the case was welcomed by Sam Kazman, general counsel of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank that is funding the litigation.
"The need for a quick and final resolution of this question is undeniable," Kazman said in a statement.
David Cutler, a professor of applied economics at Harvard University, said on Friday that if the court throws out the subsidies, "the premiums would skyrocket and the thing would just die." He was speaking at an event at The Forum at Harvard School of Public Health in collaboration with Reuters.
The case will give the Supreme Court a second shot at reviewing Obamacare. In June 2012, the nine justices upheld by a 5-4 vote the constitutionality of Obamacare's core feature that requires people to get health insurance.
The court also ruled that the states are not required to sign on to the expansion of the Medicaid assistance program for people on low incomes that the law envisioned as mandatory.
The high court's decision to hear the subsidies availability case is somewhat surprising since there is no split among federal appeals courts on the issue.
In July, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the subsidies, but the court later threw out that ruling and decided to rehear the case. Oral arguments in that case are scheduled for Dec. 17.
The case before the Supreme Court, expected to be argued in early March, is King v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-114.

Govt may privatise Air India | IPOs to watch out for in 2015Government unveils draft aviation policy; may privatise Air India, Pawan Hans
ET Bureau Nov 10, 2014, 04.00AM IST

Aai
(Civil Aviation Minister…)
NEW DELHI: The government on Monday announced a draft set of reforms for the aviation sector that includes plans to list airport operator Airports Authority of India (AAI) and helicopter service provider Pawan Hans Ltd, arguing that listing will not only improve efficiency but also instill transparency in their operations.
Making the announcement, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said views of the public will be sought on the draft before the government adopts the policy. "Listing improves transparency and efficiency," the minister said. "AAI will be corporatised and the listing on the stock exchanges would follow. Listing of Pawan Hans would also be undertaken with the same objective. Pawan Han's listing straightaway might make sense. For AAI also, that is possible."
Aviation secretary V Somasundaran said the ministry expects the process to conclude in six months. "After the policy is finalised, we need to get into discussions with the disinvestment ministry on various issues," Somasundaran said. "We hope to complete the process in six months.
The exercise will help bring transparency and greater professionalism in the boards of the two entities."
Analysts have welcomed the move to list the two entities. "It's a good move, as it will bring market discipline into these companies. It will not just unlock the potential of these two companies but also make them much more professional than today by providing more autonomy and professional management.
These companies should become much more professional to compete," said Dhiraj Mathur, leader-aerospace and defence at PwC India. On the suggestion to privatise national carrier Air India , Raju said it will be decided in due course of time. "If it could get listed, I would be the happiest person," the minister said. "An experts committee would be set up soon to develop a roadmap for Air India. All these suggestions have emerged.
We will have to take a conscious decision as it is a delicate matter," he said. The draft also talks of privatising only Jaipur and Ahmedabad airports and awarding management contracts for Kolkata and Chennai airports. One of the key initiatives of the draft policy is to develop helicopter aviation in the country. This is the first time that the country's aviation policy has categorised helicopter aviation separately from general aviation. The focus of the policy is to develop infrastructure to support helicopter operations.
The Business Aircraft Operators Association, a grouping of all business jet and helicopter operators, has termed this a step in the right direction. "We welcome the move to develop helicopter aviation, which will promote its greater use by industries to enable business. While we see a major thrust on remote connectivity in the draft, the role of small aircraft operators needs to be given due consideration," the association said in an email reply.

India's grains stock substantially higher than targets
Reuters Nov 10, 2014, 05.43PM IST
(India's milled rice inventory…)
NEW DELHI: India had 30.1 million tonnes of wheat in government warehouses as of Nov. 1, government officials said on Monday, more than double the official target which raises the prospect of overseas shipments from the world's second-largest producer.
Bumper harvests since 2007 have led to huge stockpiles of rice and wheat with the government, which buys from farmers to meet emergencies and for welfare programmes providing subsidised food to the poor.
India's milled rice inventory at the beginning of November was 13.7 million tonnes against a target of 7.2 million, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
The stock positions have helped cushion the blow of a weak start to the four-month annual monsoon rains in June and curb food inflation that plummeted to a near three-year low of 3.52 percent in September.
India in 2011 lifted a four-year-old ban on wheat and non-basmati rice exports to offload the grains from its bulging bins. The country has shipped out nearly 7 million tonnes of wheat from its warehouses in the past few years.
Since 2009, the government has kept an additional 3 million tonnes of wheat and 2 million tonnes of rice as strategic reserves in addition to the monthly stocks.

NEW DELHI: Singapore government's investment arm Temasek Holding has completed the acquisition of 10.16 per cent stake in Indian company Intas Pharmaceuticals.
Temasek acquired the stake by way of secondary purchase of shares from private equity investor ChrysCapital.
This investment will deepen Temasek's exposure to the country's pharma industry.
"ChrysCapital has been a valuable partner for Intas over the years. We are delighted to have lived up to the expectation of ChrysCapital and now look forward to welcoming Temasek to enable Intas to reach greater heights in the years to come," Intas Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Binish Chudgar today said in a statement.
"Intas has been an excellent investment for ChrysCapital with the company having grown revenues at 27 per cent CAGR since its investment in CY06... ChrysCapital reaffirmed its faith in the Company with a fresh Rs 300 crore investment from a separate fund in CY12 and will continue to remain invested for the next few years," ChrysCapital MD Sanjiv Kaul said.
Intas, incorporated in India, is a vertically integrated pharmaceutical company with global operations. The company has presence in more than 70 countries in North America, Europe, Central and Latin America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Asia-Pacific.
Last month, Competition Commission of India (CCI) had approved Temasek's proposed 10.16 per cent stake purchase in Intas.

NEW DELHI: Lavasa Corporation, the realty arm of construction major HCC, has received market regulator Sebi's approval for raising Rs 750 crore through an initial public offer (IPO).
The company had filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in July this year for the proposed public offer.
Sebi issued its final observations on the draft offer documents on November 7. Sebi's observations are necessary for the companies to launch any public offer.
Prior to that, Sebi had sought clarification on two instances from Lavasa's lead manager, Axis Capital Ltd, regarding the company's proposed IPO.
The company, which is developing a large township (hill city) in 10,000 hectares in 'Lavasa' near Pune, is making a second attempt to raise money though IPO.
This is the company's second effort to hit the capital market. In November 2010, Lavasa had got the Sebi clearance for an IPO to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore, but bad market conditions forced the company to scrap the plan.
As per initial papers, Lavasa plans to launch an IPO of its equity shares of Rs 10 each aggregating to Rs 750 crore. The proceeds from the current issue would be used to fund the company's growth.
The Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) group, which has 68.72 per cent stake in Lavasa, had said that proposed public issue is subject to receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, market conditions and other considerations.

Public sector banks employees to hold strike on WednesdayPublic sector banks employees to hold strike on Wednesday
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 20:49 IST
Normal banking operations such as cheque clearance in public sector banks across the country are likely to be hit on Wednesday as employees have decided to go on one-day nation-wide strike to press for wage revision.
"In negotiations held today, Indian Banks Association (IBA) stuck to its earlier stand of 11 per cent (wage hike) despite unions scaling down their demand to 23 per cent. Consequently, the conciliation ended in failure," United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) Convener M V Murali told PTI.
Hence, the call for strike on November 12 stands, he added.
"We have scaled down our demand from 25 per cent to 23 per cent, but IBA is not yielding. It has been sticking to its earlier offer of 11 per cent which is not enough," Ashwini Rana, General Secretary of National Organisation of Bank Workers, said.
Banks, including the country's largest one SBI, have already informed customers about the inconvenience they are likely to face on Wednesday.
"UFBU has given a notice to IBA calling for nationwide bank strike on the November 12 and All-India State Bank Officers Federation and All-India State Bank of India Staff Federation being a part of UFBU will also participate in the said strike," SBI said in a statement.
"Since the said call is given at all-India level covering all banks, the bank will not be impacted separately," the statement said.
Monday's meeting before the Chief Labour Commissioner ended in a deadlock so unions would go on with strike call, All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) General Secretary C H Venkatachalam said.
The staff of public sector banks had gone on a nationwide strike for two days beginning February 10 after discussions with the IBA had failed.
The wage revision of public sector bank employees has been due since November, 2012.
The UFBU is an umbrella organisation of nine bank employee and officer unions.
There are 27 public sector banks in the country with a combined employee strength of about 8 lakh. There are about 50,000 branches of these banks across the country.

Performance-chasing could spur year-end rallyPerformance-chasing could spur year-end rally

It’s the time of year when money managers whose funds are lagging the overall market or specific index or style benchmarks they are measured against have to start playing catch-up. And with a large swath of funds lagging behind this year, that means a lot of fund managers could chase the market and buy stocks.
And that so-called performance-chasing could provide yet another building block for a market already trading at record highs on the strength of a strong seasonal tailwind, robust corporate earnings, an improving economy and continued support and stimulus from central banks around the globe.
Only 14% of fund managers posted returns that topped the performance of the S&P 500 index this year through the end of October, according to an analysis done by Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The average fund return was 8.6%, which trailed the market benchmark by almost 2.5 percentage points. Fewer than 6% of growth fund managers topped the S&P 500, BofA data show.
Only 14% of actively managed funds had topped the performance of the benchmark S&P 500-stock index in 2014 through the end of October. (Chart: BofA)
Similarly, fewer than 18% of fund managers topped the large-cap Russell 1000 stock index — putting the funds’ miss rate at its worst level in 10 years.
While Subramanian says she’s not a big believer in the thesis that the market gets a fourth-quarter boost from funds “buying risk in an attempt to catch up,” many Wall Street pros say it can have a bullish effect on the market near year’s end.

LeapFrog has entered the console wars with the release of LeapTV, a gaming console built from the ground up for little kids. It combines the best of Wii-type pointer play with active gaming similar to Kinect, and weaves education into the mix. The result is a gaming system for kids ages 3-8 that gets them up and moving as they learn.
The new LeapTV system ($149.99) comes with a compact console (a round device about the size of a CD player), motion-sensing camera, camera mount, one two-way transforming controller, and HDMI cable. The console has 16 GB of memory and built-in Wi-Fi for downloads; and it delivers 720p HD gaming, which means the games look about as high def as those seen on the WiiU.
The console needs three to six feet of play space in front of the TV. Parents can set up five separate profiles and one guest from within the password-protected Parental Controls.
Parental controls don't include the ability to set a timer for the amount of gaming, which is disappointing. However, you can select the child's school grade so that the games automatically deliver age-appropriate educational content. The games also support adaptive leveling, based on how your child is doing.
Two things make this system interesting: It has three ways to play, and education has been added into the gaming.
Kids can play by standing in front of their TVs.

As with Kinect, kids can play many of the games on this system by simply standing in front of the TV with no controller. Their bodies become the controller as they see themselves jumping and dancing
The system's transforming controller provides two additional ways to play games. In its classic gaming position, the controller has two handles to let kids use a classic joystick to control characters, and two buttons for jumping and executing attacks. But, this controller can also transform to a Wiimote-like pointer by pushing a button and pulling the two handles apart.
Every game for this system will be educational. At launch, there are eight available, but by year end, there will be 100 videos, apps and games for downloading using LeapTV marketplace. Branded characters are on board, including Jake and the Never Land Pirates, Sofia the First, Bubble Guppies and more.
Since a gaming system is only as good as the games that play on it, I ran four of the launch games (sold separately for $29.99) through their paces to provide a frame of reference for this review. Three of the four were home runs. Not bad.
I am most impressed with the Dance & Learn game for kids ages 4-7. Kids get their groove on in nine movement games that also teach early-reading skills.
Also fun is Kart Racing: Supercharged!, a Mario Kart-type game about putting the pedal to the metal while also doing fast math. For ages 5-8, this game supports two-players, if parents buy a second controller for $29.99.
Sports, for ages 4-7, delivers nine different arenas for combined sports and math domination. Expect to see your kids karate-chopping geometric shapes.
I would stay away from Marvel Ultimate Spider-Man, a math and Web-slinging game for ages 4-7. Its controls don't always work and it contains violence that seems inappropriate for the target age, including boss battles (defeating super-tough baddies) with a lot of combat.
Here's the bottom line: This is a great starter console for kids. It's a snap to set up, delivers high-resolution gaming, gets kids moving as they think and encourages fun play experiences with others. Unlike the other consoles, which cater to players ages 8 and up, this product features games that are made for young children, and include appropriate audio and visual cues. And unlike educational tablet play, LeapTV delivers active gaming that is social.

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

Obamacare rates in Illinois: Higher premiums  more options in 201530
IlliniCare Health is new to the marketplace this year, and will be offering HMO plans in Cook County to a very specific target market — low-income consumers no longer eligible to be covered by Medicaid. Partnered with the Sinai Health System on Chicago's West Side, and Swedish Covenant Hospital on the North Side, the plans were created to follow the so-called "churn" population, whose increased income qualifies them for private insurance.
Previously, IlliniCare Health worked exclusively with the Illinois Medicaid population. The company is part of St. Louis-based Centene, which offers Medicaid plans across the country through contracts with 17 states.
"We wanted to focus on those neighborhoods in the city that sometimes get left behind," said Lindsey Artola, spokeswoman for IlliniCare Health. "I think a lot of plans are focused more on the higher-income, healthier populations, and our sweet spot has always been the most vulnerable, so that's what we're targeting our marketplace product to as well."
Lake County residents are likely to see higher premium increases on average than those in other Chicago-area counties, including Cook, according to state data. Lake County rate increases are in the 5 to 10 percent range for the lowest-cost silver plans, while Cook, DuPage and Will counties can expect increases of zero to 5 percent, according to a map released by the insurance department.
Plans on the health care marketplace range from bronze for the least expensive premiums through silver, gold and platinum, which has the highest premiums. However, bronze plans generally have the highest out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, copays and coinsurance, while platinum plans have the lowest out-of-pocket costs.
During last year's enrollment, 56 percent of Illinois residents who bought plans on the exchange picked a silver plan, 29 percent picked a bronze plan, 15 percent picked gold and 1 percent picked platinum.
Those with household incomes up to $46,680 for a person and $95,400 for a family of four are eligible for subsidies.
According to examples supplied by the Illinois insurance department, in 2015 a single 30-year-old in Chicago or Peoria with a household income of $23,000 could be eligible for a subsidy of $72 per month in Chicago or $88 in Peoria. That could bring his or her monthly cost to $119 per month in both cities on the second-lowest-cost silver plan, compared with $121 per month this year.
A couple from Chicago or Peoria, both age 55, with household income of $40,000 could be eligible for a subsidy of $479 in Chicago and $540 in Peoria. That could bring their costs for the second-lowest silver plan to about $273 per month in 2015 versus about $276 this year.
Consumers must select a plan by Dec. 15 to avoid being automatically re-enrolled in the same plan and to ensure coverage  Jan. 1. Open enrollment ends Feb. 15.

The Hitachi CP DH 300 is a full HD and 3D projector. It has a 3000ANSI Lumens lamp, which has a life of 4,000 hours. It is capable of projection from 30 inches to 300 inches without compromising on quality.
This is a short throw projector done in glossy white that makes it look good and gel beautifully in any home environment. The device is easy to set up. Hitachi has added controls on the projector and it is accompanied with a remote control.
There are three indicator lights for lamp, temperature and power. Just below these are buttons for power, mode, menu, and source, etc. The connectivity options placed at the back include an HDMI port, two VGA ports, and monitor out, video in. There isn't any USB port for playing content directly from a pen drive.
It doesn't take long to start up and detects the source automatically. Unlike many projectors, it doesn't throw hot air or sound. However, it does heat up after 15 minutes of use, which seems to be normal in most home projectors. While projection of this projector is great, what impressed me the most was the 3D projection.
We played multiple videos on YouTube and the 3D effects were superb. Under settings, there are basic options of selecting the wall colour. There are preset modes for watching movies, playing games, for presentation, bright and user mode. For watching 3D content, there was a 3D sync setting that allows users to watch 3D movies and switch between top-bottom and side-by-side mode. Our review unit was accompanied with an active 3D glass However, it did strain our eyes after a few minutes.
Bag it or junk it: The Hitachi CP DH 300 is a great projector

The coding-focused Challenge is held each year to help attract young tech talent to Chicago. About 300 students from 10 Midwest schools took a preliminary test earlier this year. The 50 finalists were brought to Chicago this week for the final test as well as networking interviews with local companies including kCura, CDW and Cleversafe.
Matthews plans to become a software developer when he graduates.
“I like Chicago a lot,” he said, after winning the award. “I can see myself here, or maybe Seattle or somewhere on the West Coast.”
Nearly half the finalists this year came from either the University of Chicago or Northwestern University, each of which sat 12 for the final test. The Hyde Park contingent shone in the end, however, claiming the first, second, third and fifth place spots.

The Friday Exit: To succeed in business  make a few new friends0
Kate MacArthur’s story on Cari Sacks showed a different side of entrepreneurship than we often see: A mover and shaker who can fund her own project and get advice from friends like Eric Lefkofsky, the CEO of Groupon. She figured out that traditional fine-art clients might not be the best potential customer for her app, Curate, which allows users to visualize pieces of art on virtual walls matching their room measurements. “I think the 30-somethings who are buying their first piece of art from emerging artists and emerging galleries are really the right demographics for this app,” she says.
Jimmy Odom also talked to John Carpenter about staying the course on delivery even as his company also emphasizes Locally, its new platform for merchants. Will goods in the future reach us by drones, Uber taxis or driverless cars? Another reminder this week of our appetite for convenience: an as-told-to version of the made-in-Chicago GrubHub story. And it was bye by blog as Paul Lee announced he was stepping down from his role at Lightbank to lead a project he’s so far referring to only as Stealth Co.
Amina Elahi’s story about the new Argo Tea app reflects an idea we often muse on in our nearby coffee destinations, where we enjoy conversing with visitors to Chicago but don’t necessarily want them debating the menu in front of us, and where we are occasionally fooled by seeing a lone customer in line who winds up ordering eight espresso drinks. And that idea is: Can’t there be a line for regulars? Ordering and paying ahead has the potential to achieve that.
Here’s a thought: You can be pro-Chicago without being completely in denial about the rather obvious allure of California. What story do tech leaders tell prospective recruits about why to land here and not there? Here are a few who at least start by admitting it’s not the weather.
We were feeling the effects of the time change this week, and Inc. offered a few tips on how to create a productive but sleep-friendly culture: aka not so many late-night emails and not forcing people too far off their own normal schedules.

Bank of Baroda net slips 5.5% on higher baddebtsFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Bank of Baroda’s net profit fell 5.5% year-on-year to Rs 1,104.22 crore in the quarter ended September on account of an increase in the gross non-performing assets, which stood at 3.32% in the quarter compared with 3.11% in the June quarter. The domestic net interest margin (NIM) improved to 3.02% in the June quarter.
The net interest income rose 17.5% y-o-y to Rs 3,401.11 crore from Rs 2,894.73 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.
“The bank has taken steps to improve bottomline rather than concentrating more on the top line. Our performance was focused on improving margins and better credit management,” said P Srinivas, Bank of Baroda executive director. Total income rose 13% y-o-y to Rs 11,817.32 crore against Rs 10,447.31crore, in the same period last fiscal.
The asset quality deteriorated year-on-year in the September quarter with gross NPA ratio rising to 3.32% to Rs 13,057.57 crore from Rs 12,086.81 crore in the preceding quarter. The net NPAs fell 12 bps to 1.74% y-o-y, however, it showed a sequential rise of 16 bps.
“Our slippages have marginally come down and we have also improved our recovery position. Last year we were able to recover Rs 800 to Rs 900 crore but this time we have recovered Rs 1,900 crore. As a result of the stress in the system slippages are happening, and it will continue in the next two quarters,” said Srinivas. Provisions against NPAs stood at Rs 584.25 crore and the provision coverage ratio was at 65.39%.
Total advances in the September quarter grew 13.5% y-o y to Rs 3,85,766 crore, while retail credit increased 15.8% y-o-y to Rs 47,379 crore.

music
From Gaelic lore to lines from Lalan Fakir, Simon Thacker’s Svara Kanti stirred up a maelstrom of music, drawing from both Western and Indian Classical music with generous helpings of folk
Funnily, it worked. A guitarist from Scotland, a cellist from Poland, a Baul singer, a Punjabi folk artiste and a tabla maestro from our country…they made music that was sometimes strange but always interesting. One hesitates calling the performance a fusion concert as Simon Thacker, the creator of the group detests that term. He explained why at the inaugural concert of The Hindu Friday Review November Fest.
“It is diversity, not fusion. Each of us brings our own classical tradition of music and we stay true to that and, at the same time, develop new traditions.” He uses the word ‘coalesce’ to describe the music.
Cellist Justyna Jablonska was pure magic. The sonorous and sometimes soulful strains of sound coming from an instrument had one swaying to it. “We rarely get an opportunity to listen to this instrument here and it was grand,” said music critic Ramadevi. She also commented on the difficulty of marrying Indian and Western Classical music traditions. Another audience member, Parthasarathy, agreed but was full of admiration for Simon Thacker whose Western Classical upbringing must be so different from Indian music sensibilities. “For him to have studied our music, understood it and then reinterpreted it, is amazing,” he said.
It was like a lec-dem as Simon took time off to explain each piece before launching into it — the scales, the tonal quality of the instruments, the re-interpretations. He pointed out how certain compositions had abstract Indian influences that were then recast in ‘un-Indian ways’. The duet with the cello and the guitar was all about that. In one of his solo guitar performance, the sounds were more Middle Eastern while another solo saw Simon using digital delay to create textures.
Japjit Kaur lent the vocals with her lilting Bhojpuri and Punjabi folk songs. For those who understood the lyrics, they were about the beloved and unrequited love. The music was familiar yet unfamiliar as the sonorous notes of the cello accompanied her, instead of the Punjabi dholak or the dafli.
Swaranjali, a guitar and tabla duet, followed. Sarvar Sabri’s flying fingers kept pace with the lightening movement of Simon’s fingers; it was like watching a sitarist. They then followed that up with a foot-tapping sawal-jawab.
For many, the performance by Raju Das Baul was the icing on the cake. Simon and Raju met on Facebook and came up with this performance, that had its world premiere in Coimbatore. Raju, in a flowing gown, a turban and with bells on his feet lovingly played the Khamak. Din to gelo, sandhya holo, paar koro aamare (the day is done, it is evening, take me across)…he sang. It was goosebumps all the way as Raju threw open his voice. One was transported to the paddy fields of Bengal and its blue skies.
There is something to be said about ancient folk traditions, they are simple and straight from the heart and one can’t help but respond in the same way. Raju Das sang another gem written by Lalan Fakir. The song exhorted one to drown in oneself. That was the only way to find the treasure. The one who merely floated through life would never find the gem…The Khamak that Raju played was phenomenal. Such a simple instrument and so much depth. And he brought drama and flourish into his performance by spontaneously breaking into a dance.
As Jayashree Vivek from the audience later observed, “There is something so primeval about this music. The Western music we heard was also brilliant. But that is something we appreciate, enjoy and acknowledge cerebrally. My response to Raju Das Baul was straight from the gut!”
A melancholy Gaelic composition came next. Simon explained it was the love song of a poor girl who falls in love with a rich man and is betrayed by him. It was a lore from the Highlands, and closing one’s eyes one could imagine the wild beauty of the meadows and the loch beside which the heart-broken girl sang her heart out. Of course, it was all instrumental with the cello and the guitar playing plaintively. When asked why he did not sing the song, Simon rolled his eyes and replied, “I’d rather poke my own eyes out with a hanger than sing!” But it was beautiful and moving and conveyed the pain without using words.
The finale was a shining coming together of all the musicians to perform ‘Aruna’, which means the lustre of the rising sun.

Portfolios  track records: All you need to know about Modi s new ministersAll you need to know about Modi's new ministers

In the first cabinet expansion exercise of the Narendra Modi government, 21 ministers were inducted into the council of ministers on Sunday. Four ministers were allotted cabinet rank, whereas three took charge as ministers of state (independent charge). The remaining 14 took oath as MoS.
While former Goa chief minister Manohar Parikkar has been allotted the defence ministry, JP Nadda, who has been a long-time organisation man, is the new health minister. The incumbent Harshvardhan has been given science and technology and earth sciences. Birender Singh, who had shifted to the BJP from the Congress ahead of the Haryana elections, is the new rural development minister.
Here are the profiles of the newly sworn-in ministers and their portfolios.
Cabinet ministers
Manohar Parrikar, 58 (Defence): A metallurgical engineering graduate from IIT-Bombay, he has a reputation for honesty and simplicity. He was praised as the 'Common Man's CM' for flying without security or entourage and carrying his own briefcase.
Suresh Prabhu, 61 (Railways): He was the chemical and fertilizer minister in the first National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. Prabhu, who later became the environment minister during the NDA regime, is known as a performer. A former Shiv Sena member, he is part of international bodies on sustainable growth and climate change. A law degree holder with doctorate in climate change from Germany, Prabhu is a strong votary of a balance between economic development and environment protection. His website says he has "uncommon whiff of much needed fresh air" who introduced amendment to the Patents Act that gave fillip to the Indian generic medicine industry.
Jagat Prakash Nadda, 54 (Health and family welfare): Brought up in Patna, Nadda was one of the youngest legislators to be elected to Himachal assembly. The veteran politician who earned recognition as a Himachal Pradesh leader lost the race for BJP's presidency to Amit Shah after the Lok Sabha elections. His big leap into politics started during Emergency in 1977 as an Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad activist. Nadda is known to maintain a low profile and claims to be a disciplined solider of the RSS.
Birender Singh, 68 (Rural development): A long-time Congress man, he joined the BJP before assembly elections in Haryana this August to protest against the grand old party not agreeing to the sacking of then chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. In his long political career, he had been Congress in-charge for many states such as Uttarakhand and Himachal, and was the chairperson of many parliamentary standing committees. He had joined the BJP apparently on the assurance that he would get a Union cabinet berth.
Ministers of State (independent charge)
Bandaru Dattatreya, 67 (Labour and employment): A minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, he was president of the BJP in newly created state of Telangana. An RSS activist, he was the founding member of the party in residual Andhra Pradesh and was chairperson of several parliamentary standing committees. He had been elected to the Lower House for the first time from Secunderabad in the 10th Lok Sabha.
Rajiv Pratap Rudy, 52 (Skill development and entrepreneurship, parliamentary affairs): At an age of 38, he was inducted as one of the youngest ministers in the Vajpayee government in 2000. He was a minister of state and elevated with independent charge three years later and given the important portfolio of civil aviation. An alumni of Panjab University and MP from Bihar, he was in-charge of the party in Maharashtra, where the BJP emerged as the largest single party in the recently concluded assembly elections.
Dr Mahesh Sharma, 55 (Culture, tourism, civil aviation): A doctor by profession, Sharma is an MP from Gautam Budh Nagar, Noida. He runs several charitable hospitals and clinics in the National Capital Territory. Sharma has been a long associate of the RSS and is former Noida MLA from the BJP.
Ministers of State
Hansraj Ahir, 59 (Chemicals and fertilizers): He is a member of Lok Sabha from Chandrapur in Maharashtra and was instrumental in exposing the coal scam. It was on his letter to the Central Vigilance Commission that led to a CBI inquiry into the coal scam. He was face of the BJP in exposing the coal scam during the UPA regime and obtained relevant documents to embarrass the Manmohan Singh led government. An active parliamentarian, Ahir had introduced a large number of private member bills in over 15 years as an MP.
Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, 57 (Minority affairs, parliamentary affairs): A vocal BJP spokesperson and former MoS for information and broadcasting, Naqvi has been the Muslim face of the party for long. Born in 1957 in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, Naqvi contested his first election on now-defunct Janata Party ticket in 1980 and was one of the ministers in Vajpayee's cabinet in 1998. Known for freely airing his views, he created a flutter by saying that now even Dawood Ibrahim can join the BJP on decision to induct Bihar Janata Dal (United) leader Shabbir Ali during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
Giriraj Singh, 54 (Micro, small and medium enterprises): His emergence on the national political scene had been rather dramatic. During Lok Sabha polls, the Election Commission debarred him from campaigning after he asked all Modi detractors to go to Pakistan. And after the polls, he was in the news for about Rs. 1.14 crore stolen from his house in Patna. A firebrand Bhumihar leader, he was a minister in the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) and BJP alliance government, and has influence over vast pockets in southern Bihar, which goes to polls in 2015, and election-bound Jharkhand.
Ram Kripal Yadav, 57 (Drinking water and sanitation): A former Lalu Prasad supporter, he quit the party after being denied a ticket from Pataliputra. He contested on a BJP ticket and defeated Prasad's daughter Misa Bharti. A former deputy mayor of Patna and a law graduate, Yadav is known for his rhetoric in both the houses of Parliament, where he had represented Prasad's RJD. An aggressive campaigner with vote base among backwards in Bihar, his induction will strengthen the BJP's campaign to form the next government in the state in 2015 assembly elections.
Babul Supriyo, 44 (Urban development, housing and urban poverty alleviation): It was on a flight with Baba Ramdev as co-passenger that singer Babul Supriyo's political baptism took place. Ramdev reportedly asked Supriyo if he was interested in politics and contesting an election. The singer's induction gives West Bengal representation in the Modi cabinet. Supriyo's thumping victory from Asansol on a BJP ticket was a huge boost for the party. Born and raised in Uttarpara, he is the musical heir to a prestigious musical family of Bengal and the grandson of the noted composer, Banikantha NC Baral.
Jayant Sinha 51 (Finance): The 51-year-old Hazaribagh MP, Jayant Sinha, is a former corporate honcho with wide experience in corporate governance and strategy consulting. He will be an asset in an economic ministry. Son of former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, he spent 12 years with McKinsey & Company as a partner apart from serving as president of Internet Business Capital Corp and in consulting positions at Stone & Webster and Synergic Resources Corporation, US. Sinha is an MBA with distinction from the Harvard Business School; has an MS in Energy Management and Policy from the University of Pennsylvania; and a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering with distinction from the IIT, Delhi.
Sanwar Lal Jat, 59 (Water resources, river development and ganga rejuvenation): Sanwar Lal Jat had defeated Congress heavyweight Sachin Pilot from the Ajmer seat. His elevation balances the Jat-Rajput equation in Rajasthan. Jat is a powerful leader in the area and had quit the Vasundhara Raje Cabinet to contest the elections.
Mohan Kundariya, 63 (Agricultutre): He is an influential leader from Patel community and MP from Rajkot. Powerful politician with strong roots in the Saurashtra region, he had served as minister in the Modi cabinet in Gujarat.
Ram Shankar, 50 (Human resource development): A second-time Lok Sabha member from Agra, Shankar is an academician by profession and had been part of the party's anti-corruption campaign. He was also part of several parliamentary committees in the 15th Lok Sabha. He was sworn in as minister of state.
Vijay Sampla, 53 (Social justice and empowerment): It is a rag to riches story for him. A Dalit employed as plumber in Saudi Arabia after his matriculation, he returned to Punjab a few decades ago and joined politics. A successful businessman now, Sampla was elected to Lok Sabha from Hoshiarpur in Punjab and inducted into the cabinet for the first time.
YS Chowdhary, 53 (Science and technology, earth science): It has been a meteoric rise for the TDP leader. A businessman from Hyderabad, he was unanimously elected to Rajya Sabha in 2010. His brief bio-data on the Rajya Sabha website says he is an engineer by profession but was hand-picked for the election to Upper House by TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu.
Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, 60 (Home affairs): He is an MP from Banaskantha in Gujarat. He has been a BJP member since 1988, and had been the vice-president of Gujarat state unit from 2005 to 2010.
Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, 47 (Food processing industries): The lone woman induction in the Modi cabinet, Jyoti is an MP from Fatepur who defeated RLD's Amar Singh. She was in news recently after a bid on her life and well-known RSS leanings.

The 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin WallBy Ilya Somin November 9
Today is the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. What I wrote on the 20th anniversary in 2009 is still very much relevant today:
In several ways, the Wall and its collapse are fitting symbols of communism. They demonstrate several truths about that system that we would be wise not to lose sight of.
First and foremost, Cold War-era Berlin was the most visible demonstration of the superiority of capitalism and democracy over communism and dictatorship. Despite the fact that East Germany had one of the highest standards of living in the Soviet bloc, it had to build a wall to keep its people from fleeing to the capitalist West. By contrast, West Germans and other westerners were free to move to the communist world anytime they wanted. Yet only a tiny handful ever did so. Decisions to “vote with your feet” are often even better indicators of peoples’ true preferences than ballot box voting, since foot voters have better incentives to become well-informed about the alternatives before them . Even more powerful evidence is the reality that many East Germans and others fled from communism even when doing so meant risking their lives.
Second, the Berlin Wall was an important symbol of the way in which communist governments violated the human right to freedom of movement, one of the most important attributes of a free society. If people are forcibly trapped under the rule of the government in whose territory they happen to be born, they are not truly free; rather, they are hostages of their rulers.
Finally, the sudden collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 vividly demonstrated the extent to which communist totalitarianism relied on coercion to maintain its rule. Some Western scholars and leftists contended that most Russians and Eastern Europeans actually supported communism or at least preferred it to the available alternatives. The events of 1989 gave the lie to this notion… Once the Soviet government and its puppet states in Eastern Europe signalled that they would no longer suppress opposition by force, the Berlin Wall was quickly torn down, and communist governments throughout Eastern Europe collapsed within months….
Despite all of the above, I am somewhat conflicted about the status of the Berlin Wall as the symbol of communist oppression in the popular imagination. My reservations have to do with the underappreciated fact that the Wall was actually one of communism’s smaller crimes. Between 1961 and 1989, about 100 East Germans were killed trying to escape to the West through Wall . The Wall also trapped several million more Germans in a repressive totalitarian society. These are grave atrocities. But they pale in comparison to the millions slaughtered in gulags, deliberately created famines in the USSR, China, and Ethiopia, and mass executions of kulaks and “class enemies.” The Berlin Wall wasn’t even the worst communist atrocity in East Germany….
In 2014, as in 2009, we still have a long way to go before we have fully rectified our relative neglect of the history of communist crimes . The issue is even more significant now than it was five years ago, because the Putin regime in Russia has ramped up its efforts to whitewash the communist past .

Google Study Finds Email Scams Are More Effective Than You d Expectreddit
You know those weird emails that try to trick you into handing over your information? Turns out they work way better than you'd expect, according to a new study from Google and the University of California, San Diego.
Certain websites included in phishing emails successfully lure users up to 45 percent of the time, according to the study , which came out on Thursday. Once on the bogus pages -- which tend to imitate legitimate sites, like Google itself , in an effort to obtain people's private details -- 14 percent of people unwittingly submit their information to hackers. Researchers said the percentage of people who get tricked was "much higher" than they expected.
To gather this data, Google and UCSD looked at 100 phishing emails picked out of a random sample self-reported by Gmail users. The researchers also reviewed a random sample of 100 phishing websites caught by Google's Safe Browsing system to further understand how the scams work. These websites were all created through Google Forms, which is how researchers were able to access the data.
The researchers were then able to look back and see how people interacted with the emails and websites. Even on the worst-performing phishing websites, 3 percent of users still submitted their data. On the most effective phishing sites, as many as 45 percent did.
Google notes in its write-up that this is big business for scammers, as one attacker can be responsible for millions of phishing emails.
Once a hacker is able to access someone's account, they spend an average of three minutes figuring out how much it's worth, and will apparently move on if the account doesn't seem valuable enough. According to the study, hackers use Gmail's own search function to figure out if an account is worth their time, looking for terms like "wire transfer" and "bank."
What happens next probably won't surprise you: The hacker tries try to get money from an account's contact list. They send emails to the person's friends, family and colleagues with fake stories like "we were mugged last night in an alley" in the hopes of getting them to send cash.
Google's advice for staying safe? Enable two-step verification on your email account, and report any suspicious emails instead of responding to them. And if you suspect your account has been compromised -- maybe because you've belatedly realized that something seemed off about the website you visited, or because a friend has asked you about the weird email they just got from your address -- you should work as quickly as possible to regain control . Twenty percent of hackers access compromised accounts within 30 minutes of getting their credentials , the study says.
These scams have long been a problem online, but recent examples are particularly concerning. A cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase brought the issue back into the spotlight earlier this year. That hack affected up to 76 million households, leaving an untold number of individuals vulnerable to potential phishing efforts.

Accenture develops m-Seva for Arunachal Pradesh governmentEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Accenture today announced that it is developing a mobile government system for the Arunachal Pradesh Department of Information Technology.  The system, the company said in a statement, is designed to enhance citizen access to more than 21 government services across 12 categories in eight state departments using mobile platforms and an online portal.
Following completion of the mobile government system called Arunachal m-Seva, citizen access to government services ranging from safety and health alerts to employment services and pension benefits will be enabled using these mobile tools. Digital government services help reduce costs-to-serve and improve constituent satisfaction and engagement.
The government of Arunachal Pradesh is committed to serving our citizens,” said Er. Gaken Ete, Secretary, Government of Arunachal Pradesh, Department of Information Technology. “The new mobile government system will provide increased opportunities to help us meet the needs of our citizens in new ways.”
The $70,000 contract for the development of the mobile government system has two major components – first, Accenture has developed the system requirements, which is complete; and now, Accenture will design, test and launch the mobile government system. Arunachal m-Seva will be accessible across multiple technology platforms, including Android, Windows, Nokia and iPhone, as well as marketplaces such as Google Play, Windows Phone Store, iPhone App Store and Nokia Store. Short message service (SMS) technology will be enabled for alerts on safety, health and emergency information.
Accenture also has designed and will launch a web-based portal for the eight state departments of Health, Police, Tourism, Disaster Management, Agriculture, Land Management, Social Welfare and Employment. Government officials and citizens will be able to track citizen requests, initiate actions for solutions and view transaction details.
By providing important information to citizens in an easily accessible manner, the state of Arunachal Pradesh is addressing citizen demands for digital government services at a time and place convenient to them,” said G. Sethuraman, Managing Director of Accenture’s Health & Public Service business in India. “Arunachal m-Seva is an exciting move toward a more citizen-centered government for the state.”
A recent 10-country study by Accenture ranked India eighth in its use of digital government services to engage with citizens. According to the survey, a majority (81%) of citizens want their government to provide more services through digital channels, including portals, digital channels and social media.
Mobile government extends the ability of citizens to interact with government and access important services and information to mobile platforms, including smartphones, tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and wireless internet infrastructure. By making these services available on mobile platforms, mobile government helps make public information and government services available anytime, anywhere,” continued Sethuraman.
Accenture also is working with the Arunachal Department of IT on the e-District project and with the Arunachal Pradesh Police to implement the state’s Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System (CCTNS), an integrated system to share information on crimes across India.

OPEC urges markets to stay calm about oil price plungeMarkets should not panic over recent oil price plunge, says OPEC Secretary General

Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri said, markets should not panic over the recent plunge of oil prices because the situation will resolve itself,  said on Monday.
"Please do not panic, things will fix(ed) itself," Badri said during a panel discussion at a major energy industry conference in Abu Dhabi.
United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, who was also on the panel, delivered a similar opinion, saying, "We are not seeing the price issue as a major issue that we need to panic about."
Badri indicated that both producers and consumers would be happy with oil prices in a broad range around US $100 per barrel.
"In the last five to six years we don't see any nagging by consumers or producers... $100, $110, $95, they are happy with these prices," Badri said.
The OPEC Secretary-General also said, "A high price is not preferable by OPEC, a low price is not preferable by OPEC" because high prices would mean less demand while low prices would reduce investment in oil supply.
Meanwhile, the basket of 12 crude oils of the OPEC closed at US $78.67 a barrel on Friday compared to $78.27 last Thursday (Oct 30), the OPEC Secretariat said.

Enough evidence in coal scam case, says CBI

trials
Earlier, on October 21, CBI had filed a "detailed and comprehensive" report before the court in the case.
Changing its stand, the CBI informed a special court here on Monday that “there is prima facie enough material on record’’ to prosecute chairman of Aditya Birla Group Kumar Mangalam Birla and former Coal Secretary P.C. Parakh, in connection with the allocation of coal blocks to Hindalco in violation of the rules.
Hindalco is the metals flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group.
“Special Public Prosecutor states that from the overall facts and circumstances, there is prima facie enough material on record to take cognisance of various offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code against the private parties and some of the public servants involved in the process of allocation of impugned coal blocks.
A compilation of the relevant documents has also been filed for a ready reference,’’ Special Judge Bharat Parashar said in his brief order.
Among other persons, Mr. Birla and Mr. Parakh figure as accused in the investigation report filed by the CBI in the case. Later, the judge fixed November 25 as the date for consideration of the CBI’s investigation report in the case for further proceedings.
Judge to consider CBI probe report on November 25
Special Judge Bharat Parashar heariang the coal blocks allocation case has fixed November 25 as the date for consideration of the CBI’s investigation report in the case for further proceedings.
Among other persons, chairman of Aditya Birla Group Kumar Mangalam Birla and former Coal Secretary P.C. Parakh figure as accused in the investigation report filed by the CBI in the case.
The investigating agency had earlier sought closure of the case. On perusal of the probe report, the Special Judge had in September pulled up the investigating agency for not filing the original of minutes of the Screening Committee, along with the final report with a plea to close the case. The Screening Committee had considered the company’s application for allocation of coal blocks to Hindalco.
The investigating agency had later filed a revised investigation report with all the documents.
The CBI had last year lodged an FIR against Mr. Parakh, Mr. Birla and others, alleging that Mr. Parakh had reversed his earlier decision not to allocate coal blocks to Hindalco without any valid basis or change of the circumstances and shown undue favour to it.
Coal block allocation: chronology of events
July 14, 1992
A number of coal blocks, which were not in the production plan of Coal India Ltd and the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), were identified and a list of 143 blocks were prepared.
1993 to 2010
A total of 70 coal mines or blocks were allocated between 1993 and 2005, 53 in 2006, 52 in 2007, 24 in 2008, 16 in 2009 and one in 2010.
In all, 216 block were allocated between 1993 and 2010, out of which 24 were taken away at different points in time, effectively leaving the total number of allocated blocks at 194.

Scientists develop single dose nano medicine for osteoporosis in ratsScientists develop single dose ‘nano medicine’ for osteoporosis in rats
Vanita Srivastava , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 10, 2014
First Published: 18:31 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 18:35 IST(10/11/2014)
Scientists have developed a nanoparticle that can stimulate growth of bone forming cells and deliver the drug used for osteoporosis straight to the affected area in rats which can show a way forward for reversal of osteoporosis in humans.
 
The study was published recently in the online version of European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Further clinical trials are needed before reaching the medical shelf.
About 9 million bone fractures occur each year due to osteoporosis, a progressive bone disease in  which bone loses both its mass and density, thereby becoming weaker. Current treatment  regimes involve restricting further bone damage, but not restoring previous strength. Zoledronic acid (ZOL) is the commonly used drug; it has successfully reduced risk of fracture in post- menopausal women. However, prolonged use of the drug can cause several adverse effects like  unwanted bone changes.
A team of engineers and pharmacologists from IISc and Al-Ameen college of Pharmacy,  Bangalore, has come up with a modified ZOL drug, which has proved to be effective in  treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. What makes this novel mode of treatment even more  special is the use of extremely small particles, called “nanoparticles”, for drug delivery.
“We have designed a new formulation, where the ZOL is first adsorbed on nanoparticles of  hydroxyapatite and carried to osteoporotic bone by intravenous injection”, said lead author  Deepak Kumar Khajuria. “We are able to demonstrate successfully that this formulation not only prevents further bone loss, but also stimulates bone growth”, he added.
The nanoparticles are made of synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA). HA is naturally present in our  bodies: it makes up bone mineral and the matrix of teeth. It stimulates bone forming cells. The  modified ZOL drug used in the study has a high affinity to bone, and prevents further bone loss.
The team used 12 week old female rats, whose ovaries were removed so that bone remodeling  would not occur. Various doses of HA, ZOL and a combination of both were tested on the rats.
Three months after the treatment, the lumbar vertebra and femur (thigh bone) was tested for  mechanical properties. Both showed better strength and structure after the combined treatment. A  host of sensitive biochemical tests to predict whether new bone growth occurred were also  carried out, all of which showed improvement with the combined treatment.

Defence deals to be transparent  faster: ManoharParrikarManohar Parrkiar asked everyone to give him time to understand the issues concerning the new Ministry. (Source: PTI photo)
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 6:39 pm
Manohar Parrikar today took charge as Defence Minister and said the defence acquisition process will be transparent and fast under his stewardship.
58-year-old Parrikar met with Defence Secretary R K Mathur and all the three Services Chiefs minutes after he took over in his South Block Office.
The new Minister echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make-in-India” slogan and said the country should manufacture “as much as possible” domestically.
“Very unfortunate. Whatever will be there will be very transparent but fast process. I think that is one of my specialties,” he told reporters here replying to a question about the delayed acquisition process in the last 10 years and defence deals often getting mired in corruption.
He asked everyone to give him time to understand the issues concerning the new Ministry.
Parrikar, who earlier today filed his nomination paper to Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, said he was “equally worried” over the recent sinking of a torpedo recovery vessel off the coast of Visakhapatnam and recalled the series of accidents that the Navy has had over the last year and a half.
“Let me first take real grip of the situation so that the exact position can be expressed to you,” he said.
With his task cut-out, Parrikar, an IITian, thanked Modi for reposing confidence in him by giving him this “very important and sensitive Ministry”.
“I am also aware that Jaitley (who was holding Defence as an additional charge) has done, in spite of constraints, a lot of initiation work on many of the issues concerning the defence and I am quite confident of taking them ahead with speed,” he said.
The former Goa Chief Minister admitted though he has exposure and good administrative experience, the type of requirement at the national level may be different.
“I was left with no time. Let me be frank. I had to virtually pack in five minutes. Two days was given for all the excercise,” he said while requesting the media to give him time to understand the issues concerning the Ministry.
Asked about Modi’s “Make-in-India” slogan, Parrikar said the Prime Minister has been very clear in opening up of the defence sector.
“I feel that as much as possible we should manufacture here in India. Any country with good manufacturing ways, irrespective of defence or any other, can come up economically by generating a lot of employment opportunities,” he said adding he hopes to make use of his ministerial colleague Rajiv Pratap Rudy’s new Skill Development Ministry.
“Skill development is a very important issue and the reason why we need that is that in earlier years, skill was passed down (generations). Now we have to train people. New skills have come up, new requirement. We need to develop that fast. Defence also needs it in all continued…

New office leases to create over 2.7 lakh jo...Bangalore
(About 23 million sq ft…)
NEW DELHI: Office space leasing of around 23 million sq ft in the country's seven major cities in the first nine months this year has a potential to generate over 2.7 lakh job opportunities, property consultant CBRE said today.
Based on space leased during January-September, Bangalore tops the cities with most opportunities, CBRE said.
"Consequent to corporate real estate transaction closures during the first nine months of the year across the leading seven cities in the country, CBRE notices the potential generation of office employment opportunities of over 2,70,000," CBRE South Asia CMD Anshuman Magazine said.
About 23 million sq ft of office space has been leased in seven cities -- Delhi-NCR , Mumbai, Kolkata , Chennai , Bangalore, Pune and Hyderabad.
"The major demand driver for corporate real estate during the first three quarters of 2014 was predictably the IT/ITeS sector which absorbed about 8 million sq ft of office space across the key commercial districts -- accounting for nearly 32 per cent of this overall potential employment opportunity," CBRE said.
It witnessed a steady demand growth for office space from other sectors like Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) - almost 16 per cent, manufacturing and engineering (about 10 per cent) and consulting and research (10 per cent), among others.
"Commercial leasing in the first nine months of 2014 indicate Bangalore to be the top city in India to offer potential office employment opportunities, with about 30 per cent share of the overall opportunity generated across sectors in the leading seven cities," CBRE said.
The Garden City is followed by Mumbai and Delhi-NCR. "The key reasons behind Bangalore being the centre of such real estate activity could be attributed to more rational commercial property values and abundant quality investment- grade office space at a fraction of the cost of the other major metropolitan cities of Mumbai and the NCR," Magazine said.

Six out of 10 Indian men admit violence against wives: UN studyComments
Six out of 10 men in India admit to having perpetrated violence against their wives or partners, with men who experienced discrimination as children or faced financial stresses more likely to be abusive, said a study released on Monday.
The report, by the United Nations World Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Washington-based International Center for Research on Women, polled 9,205 men, aged 18 to 49, across seven states to understand their views on masculinity, partner violence and son preference.
Violence was defined as emotional such as insults, intimidation and threats, or physical and sexual such as pushing, punching and rape. It also included economic abuse in which a man did not permit his wife or partner to work or took her earnings against her will.
"Many men in India act in a manner that is fairly predetermined by their gendered roles and expectations, socio-economic characteristics and childhood experiences," said the 'Masculinity, Intimate Partner Violence and Son Preference' report.
"Men who experience economic stress were more likely to have perpetrated violence ever or in the past 12 months. This may be because of norms related to masculinity, which reinforce the expectation that men are primary economic providers for their households."
The study - across the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra - found that men who had experienced discrimination as children were four times more likely to be violent towards their partners.
The highest reports of violence came from Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, said the report, with more than 70% of men in these regions admitting to being abusive towards their wives and partners.
More than 38% of all crimes committed against women in India in 2013 were those registered under the charge of cruelty by husband or his relatives, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).
Such crimes make up the largest proportion of crimes against women in the country - with 118,866 cases of cruelty by husband or his family reported from a total of 309,546, says the NCRB.
Physical violence most common
The study, which also polled 3,158 women, said more than half (52%) of women said they had experienced some form of violence during their lifetime.
Physical abuse such as being kicked, slapped, choked and burned was the most commonly reported, with 38% of women saying they had faced such abuse. This was followed by emotional, sexual and economic violence respectively.
The reason less women reported being victims than men  reported being violent was a feeling of shame or fear of social stigma, said the report. They may have also believed such acts were normal in a relationship and expected men to exert some control on their lives, it added.
Women who were discriminated against as children were three to six times more likely to experience violence.
"Women who experienced and observed discrimination or violence growing up are more likely to justify it as adults and may therefore not resist circumstances that may trigger intimate partner violence," the report said.
The head of UNFPA in India, Frederika Meijer, said that this research into the causes of violence would help to structure programmes to engage men and boys more effectively.
"It identifies triggers that could enable them to become change agents in addressing gender discrimination," Meijer said at the launch of the report on the sidelines of the MenEngage conference aimed at getting men involved in gender equality.

Suicide bomber kills 47 schoolboys in NigeriaSuicide bomber kills 47 schoolboys in Nigeria

Boko Haram was suspected of killing nearly 50 pupils in a suicide bombing in northeastern Nigeria on Monday, in one of the worst attacks against schools teaching a so-called Western curriculum.
The explosion ripped through an all-boys school in Potiskum just as students gathered for morning assembly before classes began, causing panic and chaos.
The massacre came just a day after the release of a new Boko Haram video in which the Islamist group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, again rejected Nigerian government claims of a ceasefire and peace talks.
Students at the Government Comprehensive Senior Science Secondary School were waiting to hear the principal's daily address when the explosion happened at 7.50am (0650 GMT).

Several witnesses described the blast as "thunderous" and the bloody aftermath a scene of abandoned footwear, school books, bags and body parts.
"There was an explosion detonated by a suicide bomber. We have 47 dead and 79 injured," national police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu said, adding that Boko Haram was believed to be responsible.
One rescue worker said the wounded had "various degrees of injuries", while those who survived complained of hearing problems from the deafening blast.
The school has more than 1,000 pupils and caters for boys aged 15 to 20. The victims are all thought to be in their teens.
Blood-stained uniforms
Student Adamu Abdullahi said those at the centre of the blast near the principal's office were flung in all directions and others were knocked off their feet.
"I found myself under the weight of another student, who fell over me. I'm certain he was dead. I was dazed and disorientated for a moment," he told AFP.
"When I realised what had happened, I managed to push the body on top of me and started running like everyone else. It was confusion all over. Everybody was hysterical.
"I saw many people on the ground. Human flesh and blood were splattered all over the place... I ran out of the school and went home. "When my father saw me he was terrified. I didn't realise my white school uniform was stained with human blood and bits of flesh."

The dead and injured were taken to the Potiskum General Hospital just 100 metres (yards) away. Boko Haram, which wants to create a hardline Islamic state in northern Nigeria, has previously carried out deadly attacks on schools teaching a so-called Western curriculum since 2009.
In February, gunmen killed at least 40 students after throwing explosives into the dormitory of a government boarding school in Buni Yadi, also in Yobe state.
In July last year, 42 students were killed when Boko Haram stormed dormitories in a gun and bomb attack on a government boarding school in the village of Mamudo, near Potiskum. Boko Haram's most high-profile attack on a school came in April, when fighters kidnapped 276 girls from the town of Chibok in Borno state, also in northeast Nigeria.
More than six months later, 219 of the girls are still being held. Monday's attack will again raise concerns about the level of security at schools in northern Nigeria. Abdullahi said the establishment was "not properly fenced".
"Anybody can go in and out unhindered," he added.
Relentless violence
Potiskum, the commercial hub of Yobe state, has been repeatedly targeted by deadly attacks blamed on Boko Haram. Last Monday, at least 15 people were killed in a suicide bombing on a Shiite religious ceremony in the city.
On Wednesday, 16 men arrested by the military on suspicion of links to Boko Haram were found dead with bullet wounds just hours later. Yobe is one of three northeastern states that has been under a state of emergency since May last year to try to quell the bloody insurgency.
But violence has continued unabated and Boko Haram has seized at least two dozen towns and villages in recent months, raising doubts about the government's ability to control the region.
Boko Haram fighters were seen in a new video obtained by AFP on Sunday parading a tank in an unidentified town that they apparently now control and Shekau preaching to locals.
The message in the 44-minute video appeared to be aimed at reinforcing Shekau's claim that he has created a caliphate within Nigeria. Shekau, who has previously expressed solidarity with other jihadi groups and leaders, seemed to associate territory under his control with a wider, global caliphate.
But he does not submit to the authority of any other leader.

TN fishermen row: Swamy seeks Modi s interventionComments
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy's tweet on Monday that prime ministerial intervention could secure transfer of five Tamil fishermen, sentenced to death for drug handling by Sri Lankan court, to India raised hopes in the state.
"Namo and Rajapaksa spoke on the phone yesterday&agreed to process papers & transfer 5 fishermen convicted to Indian jail. I am vindicated," Swamy said in a tweet.

He also told a television channel that the five fishermen would be transferred to an Indian jail under an agreement between the two nations.
Swamy said reliable sources have told him that Prime Minister Narendra Modi managed to convince Sri Lankan president of the Indian sensitivities but had assured him of utmost regard for Sri Lankan democracy and legal system.
All the political parties in Tamil Nadu are in one voice in the plight of the five fishermen and want their release at the earliest.
Relatives of the fishermen had also called on top BJP leader and union minister Nitin Gdkari when he visited Rameswaram last week.
This has become a highly emotional issue in Tamil Nadu which has sparked off protests by people from all walks of life.
On Monday, women lawyers in Chennai held a protest demonstration demanding the release of the five condemned fishermen.

President Barack Obama took a strong stance on Monday on new 'net neutrality' regulations being drafted by the Federal Communications Commission, saying the agency should reclassify broadband to regulate it more like a public utility.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

The 29 States Where You Can Still Be Fired For Being Gayreddit
Tim Cook came out as gay in an essay in Businessweek on Thursday. He said that the unequal treatment LGBT employees face all over the country was a critical factor in his decision.
"I’ve had the good fortune to work at a company that loves creativity and innovation and knows it can only flourish when you embrace people’s differences," Cook wrote. "Not everyone is so lucky."
Indeed, there is no federal law protecting LGBT workers against discrimination based on their sexual orientation. And while some states and cities have passed their own protections, there are still 29 states where you can actually be fired for being gay, leaving more than half of all total workers vulnerable to employment discrimination.
Most Americans incorrectly think that this problem has already been solved. A 2013 HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 69 percent of Americans think that firing people for being gay is illegal.
A proposed federal law called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act would provide protections for all LGBT Americans working for employers with at least 15 employees. It's been introduced in nearly every Congress since 1994, but has never passed.
Apple's home state of California has some of the most robust anti-discrimination laws in the country, and the company itself is an outspoken advocate for LGBT rights.
"If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it’s worth the trade-off with my own privacy," Cook wrote in his essay.

Why Some People Pay More Than Others When Shopping Onlinereddit
You may pay more than your friends when shopping online based on your web browsing history or what kind of smartphone you own, according to a new study analyzing price discrimination on e-  commerce sites.
In April and May of this year, researchers at North­eastern Uni­ver­sity in Boston studied the search results of 300 people who visited 16 online retailers and travel agencies. On nine of those sites, they found that customers were shown different prices or different results for the same searches.
The researchers said such differences -- which they called "price discrimination" or "price steering" -- are based on data collected about consumers and can be hard for online shoppers to detect.
“As a user, it’s almost impossible to know whether the prices you are being shown have been altered, or if cheaper products have been hidden from search results,” one of the researchers, Christo Wilson, wrote in an op-ed this week in the Washington Post.
For example, the study said that online travel company Expedia displays pricier hotels to some users based on the browsing history stored on their computers, which are called "cookies," though researchers could not determine what sort of browsing activity triggered the higher prices.
An Expedia spokesman declined to comment on the study's findings.
In about 5 percent of search results, Travelocity, another online travel agency, displayed hotel rooms that were $15 a night cheaper if the customer viewed the site on an iPhone or iPad, the study found.
Travelocity did not return a request for comment. But the company has long offered “mobile exclusive” deals for people making reservations on smartphones or tablets.
Home Depot's website displayed search results for smartphone users that contained pricier goods than for consumers using desktops, suggesting the retailer is "effectively steering users on mobile devices towards more expensive products," the researchers said.
Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes disputed the study's findings, calling them "misleading."
"The fact is that we never steer customers to more expensive products based on the device they use to search, and we never adjust pricing based on their device," Holmes said in an email to HuffPost.
The study is the latest attempt to shed light on the opaque methods that many e-commerce sites use to show consumers different online deals. The strategy is based on data collected about shoppers and is often a way to boost sales.
In 2012, the Wall Street Journal found that Staples was displaying different prices to people based on their locations and Orbitz had shown different hotel offers to Mac and PC visitors after learning that Mac users spent more on hotels. Orbitz told the Northeastern researchers it discontinued the practice, which it called an "experiment."
The Northeastern researchers said it was difficult to offer advice on how to obtain the lowest prices online because each site uses different methods for displaying search results and they can change over time.
But they suggested the best way to avoid price discrimination is for online shoppers to search for products in three ways: on a desktop browser, using a private “incognito” browser and on a mobile device.

Black People Are More Than Twice As Likely As White People To Struggle To Afford Foodreddit
Think we're living in a "post-racial society"? Think again. A recent Gallup poll found that black people are more than twice as likely as white people to have trouble putting food on the family table.
Gallup surveyed a random sample of 148,854 adults age 18 or older and asked if at any time in the last year they did not have enough money to afford food.
On the whole, 17.2 percent of Americans reported difficulty paying for food, which is down from a peak a 18.9 percent in 2013.
The percentage of black people who can't afford food was a lot higher.
Twenty-nine percent of black people surveyed by Gallup said they had trouble affording food, more than twice as much as the percentage of white people (13.3 percent). Hispanic people were right behind blacks at 25 percent.
The survey is just the latest indicator of the huge racial economic divide that persists in the U.S. As Gallup points out, the median household income among black people ($34,598) is far less than that of white people ($58,270). And when it comes to household wealth, white families are about six times as wealthy as black families. According to data cited in a 2013 report from the Urban Institute, the average white family held about $632,000 in assets in 2010; the average black family had $98,000. That gap grew wider in the last couple of decades.
Black people are also more than twice as likely as white people to be unemployed.

'There is a strong possibility that your business may fail. This is simply a statistical reality.'
People often say that if you make it five years in business, you've beat the odds. What they don't often share with you are the things that happen in those first five years that contribute to the high number of people whose businesses don't make it.
I'm here to tell you about the personal hardships you're likely to face in the early stage of business ownership. If someone had told me about these, I might have saved some tears, prevented an early wrinkle and lowered my blood pressure. These tips are straight from my personal experiences starting various companies in the past several years:
8
It's lonely. Whether or not you have a partner, it can be lonely. Your hours will become nontraditional, you may be working out of your home or in a small office, and you will focus all your attention on work. None of these factors make for a great social life early on. Realize that this stage is temporary and try to make time for people who have been there before. They can demonstrate that it gets better and help you take your mind off work.
Business partnerships are hard. Just because you are “best friends” or have “opposite skill sets” doesn't mean you'll make ideal business partners. (I work with my twin brother, which needs its own guide book!) At the end of the day, treat a business partnership with the respect you'd give a romantic partnership. Also consider a “pre-nup.” This should be an operating agreement (get a life insurance policy too so you can buy each other out if a fatality occurs). Above all, be cautious before you commit to a business partner. You don't want to take valuable time, energy and money away from the business to break up your partnership later.

You will be poor for a while. Unless you have a trust fund, a huge savings account, or a wealthy partner, chances are high that you'll be scraping by for a while. In the long run, this will help you make savvy financial decisions. But while you're in it, it won't be easy. Every decision begins to look like it's colored by a financial lens. You'll realize that you might not be able to go to dinner with your friends, take vacations or go shopping. You may even cancel your gym membership and magazine subscriptions (I did). This is all a great training ground for when you do have money — hopefully you'll remember these tough times and be careful with your earnings.
It's way less sexy than you think it is. We see a lot of images of cool entrepreneurs who made it big. Most of these business celebrities went through hard times but don't get the opportunity to talk about them in the media, can't remember them well, or don't want us to know about the hurdles they jumped. This is like the entrepreneurship version of airbrushing: It looks great on paper, but deep down, you know it's fabricated.
You will doubt your abilities. Your business will challenge you. You'll face forks in the road you could have never predicted. When you lose your first (or 10th) big client, your employees quit, you divorce your partner, your balance sheet looks dismal, or you can't get financing, you will likely start to doubt yourself. Dig deep to get through these times. Ultimately, you need to be your biggest cheerleader.
You will think you are the only person who has gone through this. Let me be the first to assure you, many have been through this before. Many have failed. Hopefully they got back up and tried again with something new. Many have succeeded, too. None of it matters if you don't work hard for it, so keep moving forward and find someone who's more seasoned in business to mentor you.
You will cry. People often compare their business to children. When your baby has a good day or a bad day, you might find yourself crying. It's OK. Feel it and move on.
You will never know what to expect. Think of the life of your business like the stock market. There will be ups and downs, but hopefully it will make a positive upward trajectory over time. Address the issues, make a plan and execute. We are defined more by how we got up after issues arise than by how we scoot through the easy times. Napoleon Hill once said, “Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure.” Don't be afraid to take that next step.
Mistakes are inevitable. If you fear mistakes, you'll never make progress. Do your best to trust your instincts, ask for guidance from trusted sources when you need it and keep moving. Don't make the mistake of inactivity.
You will feel clueless at times. It's impossible to know everything about running your business. When you have legal, accounting, IT, real estate or other inevitable questions, get referrals to trusted experts from people in your network.
Don't compare yourself. It's natural to want to benchmark your success against peer businesses. Be wary of doing this. Regardless of how successful they are or are not, be the best you can be and don't waste energy comparing.
It may not work at all. There is a strong possibility that your business may fail. This is simply a statistical reality. If you're not afraid of failing, keep going. If you are, you may want to reconsider self-employment.
Fancy words just cover up real issues. People tend to make up trendy words to cover up inevitable problems. If you are facing an issue, pivot. It's always good to have a positive attitude. But don't let people's ability to gloss over issues make you feel down because you don't use fancy words to cover up yours.
You will be afraid of not being able to pay your bills (business and personal). Ever felt fearful that you'd miss payroll — or your rent? So have the rest of us. As long as you're making wise financial decisions in line with your projections and current revenues, you have to push these fears aside and keep selling (or fundraising). That's the only way to pay those bills, after all.
Your family and friends may question or doubt you. I'd be lying if I said I never got a call from a close friend or family member who “lovingly” asked me if I was sure I was doing the right thing. If you aren't strong enough to believe in yourself and your ideas when these constructive criticisms come your way, it may be time to consider your choice.
You won't work from 9 to 5 anymore. If you're seeking freedom of time by working for yourself, that won't likely be the case in the early stages. When your friends get off work before dinner, be prepared to work into the wee hours when necessary.
Say sayonara to a good night's sleep. You'll be thinking about the business all the time. It will cut into your sleep, relaxation and time with friends and loved ones. I like to send myself emails or write notes on my nightstand so I can try to get the maelstrom of thoughts out of my brain and get some needed sleep.
If you build it, they might not come. This is the cardinal sin of retailers and e-commerce stores who create a storefront and expect people to just walk in the door or find their site. You have to have a marketing plan in place. Execute it daily to be sure customers are finding you.
You can't have black without white. Without bad, it's tough to appreciate good. Take the hard moments and remember them in the good moments. It helps to give you perspective and be grateful for successes, big and small.

How Bill Gates And Mark Zuckerberg Conquer Fear To SucceedHow Bill Gates And Mark Zuckerberg Conquer Fear To Succeed

This country has a great admiration for entrepreneurs. Many people hold up leaders like Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Mark Zuckerberg as heroes, maybe even gods. Some believe them to be invincible superheroes. But every entrepreneur is human . And each has to battle fears every day in order to reach success. And for each fear they conquer, the better the entrepreneurs they become.
1. Fear of Failure Failure is the most obvious fear for an entrepreneur. Successful entrepreneurs never lose this fear but rather harness its energy to drive harder, faster, and better. And the best know that a bad failure means a great lesson.
2. Fear of Inadequacy Many wonder if they are good enough and smart enough to accomplish greatness. Successful entrepreneurs become great learners so they can fill gaps in their education . They also become masters of recruitment to fill gaps in their capabilities.

5 Things Successful People Do to End Their Days Right
3. Fear of the Market Catching the market just right can be like surfing a giant wave all the way to the beach. But as so with the ocean, if you miscalculate the wave's trajectory, it will slam you into the sand headfirst and crush you. Successful entrepreneurs show a healthy respect for market forces and study the dynamics so they can capitalize.
4. Fear of Fraud There are few who gain success without some sort of exaggeration of capability or connections. Successful entrepreneurs are careful not to stretch the truth far beyond reality. Even an inkling of legitimacy allows them to maintain credibility.
5. Fear of Selling Although the practice of sales is a necessary requirement for success, most people detest trying to push something on someone else. Successful entrepreneurs want their product or service to be the obvious choice. And they effectively use marketing to attract customers so fewer sales pitches are required.
6. Fear of Public Speaking Not every entrepreneur is a natural evangelist. Some have great ideas yet struggle to articulate them in front of a group of people. Successful entrepreneurs share their vision clearly, powerfully, and succinctly. They know that they must be confident on the podium to inspire others to follow the vision.
7. Fear of Leadership Being a leader is a choice that weighs much more heavily than just being a boss or starting a company. All successful entrepreneurs know that leadership is their No. 1 priority. They study, listen, and sacrifice to make sure the people who follow are continuously inspired, motivated , and rewarded for their efforts.
8. Fear of Competition The bigger you get, the more likely that someone will come gunning for you. So many people ignore or dismiss potential competitors only to be later surprised and sometimes killed in the battle. Successful entrepreneurs respect and study their competition. They create long-term strategies to differentiate in ways competitors can't follow easily.
9. Fear of Time Entrepreneurs like to be in control, and time is one of the few elements they can't affect one way or another. Successful entrepreneurs understand time is a constant, and learn how to harness its power through productivity and efficiency.
10. Fear of Embarrassment Entrepreneurs are proud people and they hate to be shamed in public. Successful entrepreneurs know that showing a healthy amount of humility is the surest way to maintain the respect they crave.
11. Fear of People Many entrepreneurs would do it all themselves if they could. But they can't. Successful entrepreneurs understand that scalability requires the attraction, development, and retention of great people . They make sure there are systems and culture in place that make the people the priority in the organization.
12. Fear of Futility No one works this hard or long just to be forgotten. Successful entrepreneurs know they need to make an impact in order to be considered a significant benefactor to society. They take society into consideration in all their work and design for their vision of the greater good .
13. Fear of Self Everyone knows his or her own demons best. Successful entrepreneurs commit time and effort to know and improve themselves . For they loathe to be the one who stands in the way of their own greatness.

Dark and dairy: The sorry tale of the milch animalsThe Hindu Beef and milk are two sides of the same coin, especially in India where cattle and buffaloes are farmed primarily for milk.
TOPICS
dairy
India has been making national and international headlines for its soaring beef exports.
However, while there is ambivalence about India’s place in the beef market, there is more or less unquestioned pride about the nation’s status as the world’s largest producer of milk. We have riots over rumours of cow slaughter. But the consumption of milk and milk products is a near-universal habit in India, probably more so among vegetarians than others. We revere cows as mothers because we use their milk. But if our dairy practices are any indication, we don’t treat our mothers well.
It’s clear that meat comes from slaughtered animals. It’s less obvious that dairy production is as traumatic and lethal to animals. Beef and milk are two sides of the same coin, especially in India where cattle and buffaloes are farmed primarily for milk. There are no ‘beef’ animals in India. Yet, bovine meat constitutes 62 per cent of India’s total meat production. Beef, in India, is sourced from the dairy industry, which is economically sustainable only because it is supported by the meat and meat by-products industries (such as leather). Therefore, if we care about cattle, we should first look into the lives of milch animals.
The dairy system inflicts suffering at every stage, starting with the calving process, for milk comes from a cow or a buffalo that has calved recently. For dairy farming to be financially viable, animals are made to calve at least once a year (for cows) and once in 15 months (for buffaloes). Calves, male and female, are separated or significantly restricted from accessing their mothers three to four days after birth. This separation is traumatic for both mother and calf, but leads to a 15-30 per cent increase in milk availability for humans. Following separation, calves are mainly fed on milk substitutes and are allowed only limited suckling. The mother’s milk is instead diverted for human consumption.
Most male calves are either sent for slaughter or let loose to starve. A limited number are used for breeding. Some are used as draught animals where they are subject to castration without anaesthesia, nose-roping, whipping and hard labour until they are old and weak. At that point, they are sent for slaughter or abandoned. The economic undesirability of male cattle is evident in the gender imbalance — 64.42 per cent female and 35.57 per cent male in cattle, and 85.18 per cent female and 14.8 per cent male in buffalo. The slaughter of male calves — whether intentional or incidental — is integral to milk production.
Healthy females are kept alive for use in the dairy industry, which means a repeated cycle of impregnation, separation, painful milking, oxytocin shots and mastitis. To keep dairy animals productive, animal husbandry manuals recommend re-impregnation around 60 days after calving — a longer calving interval is uneconomical and a shorter interval reduces milk production.
Impregnation is increasingly being carried out through artificial insemination. India’s National Dairy Plan aims to use artificial insemination on at least 35 per cent of all fertile animals by the end of 2017. Artificial insemination involves extracting semen from selected bulls and forcibly placing it in restrained cows. This technology is popular because it is efficient, allows for selective breeding of high-yielding animals and reduces the need for males.
Dairy farming involves the killing of unproductive, infertile and ‘spent’ cows and buffaloes. Milk production starts to decline after three to four lactations (pregnancies). At this stage, cows and buffaloes are sold for slaughter through middlemen, or to a smaller farmer who will use them for an additional two to three lactations before selling them for slaughter or abandoning them. An infertile or unproductive animal shares the same fate, only much earlier. India’s world-beating output of 132.4 million tonnes of milk in 2012-13 would not have been possible if cattle and buffalo were taken care of for the entirety of their natural life-spans.
Dairy cattle have a terrible choice: life can be nasty, brutish and short, if you are male; or nasty, brutish and longer, if you are female. Beef is an inevitable consequence of dairy. The data bear out this hypothesis. Figures provided by the National Dairy Development Board show that the monetary value of milk production almost tripled between 2004-05 and 2011-12. So did the monetary value of beef production. There was a 98.6 per cent match between milk and beef production over this period.
Both qualitatively and quantitatively, a milch cow or buffalo has a worse life than an animal bred solely for meat. Why, then, do we believe dairy to be better than beef?
Part of the explanation lies in psychology. Meat is obviously linked to the death of a fellow- creature. The impacts of dairy are easily veiled in narratives about ‘surplus milk’ and the Indian veneration of the cow. Of course, buffaloes that provide more than half the milk we consume as a nation don’t figure in these debates.
Neither do the environmental consequences of dairy farming, whether pollution caused by runoffs, greenhouse gas emissions, or high water footprints.
Ultimately, Indian vegetarianism is about us rather than the vulnerable creatures we claim to care for. We may prefer to turn our eyes away from the connection between our individual acts of drinking our filter coffee or morning chai, and the cow or buffalo that produced the milk.
The logic, however, is clear: drinking milk causes as much suffering as eating meat, if not more. Indeed, milk involves more cruelty than meat does.

Time running out for Narendra Modi govt  says HDFC s Deepak ParekhNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Lauding Narendra Modi for being a Prime Minister who leads from the front, industry leader Deepak Parekh has said the new government has created a “feel good wave”, but time is ticking fast to convert this euphoria into “real changes” on the ground.
Known for speaking his mind, Deepak Parekh said that if real changes are not seen on the ground then India might well lose the chance of becoming a preferred investment destination.
“We are riding a feel good wave and we are lucky that it has lasted so long. But time is ticking fast… The progress of this new government is being increasingly scrutinised and living up to the built-up expectations will not be an easy task,” Parekh, who is Chairman of mortgage lender HDFC, said.
While speaking at an ISB capital markets conclave here over the weekend, Parekh was referring to positive sentiments in the investor community after the Modi-led government came to power in May this year.
Listing out positive changes in recent times, Parekh said the new government is perceived as being able to deliver on growth, which is driving the present euphoria.
According to him, India has a Prime Minister who leads from the front and key macro fundamentals are working in the country’s favour, but changes on the ground should be seen.
“… if one does not see real, physical change on the ground, pipeline projects actually taking off, new jobs being created and faster decisions being made on policy issues, we may well lose our chance of being a preferred investment destination,” Parekh said while asserting that India cannot afford such a situation.
“We have to stay in hope that things will really turn around. I for one still believe that India’s best days are still to come, and come they will,” he added.
Even though capital markets play a very crucial role in supporting inclusive economic development, Parekh said it cannot be denied that “the optimism and enthusiasm on India today is perhaps more with foreign investors than domestic ones”.
Presenting a grim picture of retail side of the Indian capital market, he said that their direct participation is 1.4 per cent of the population whereas the same is at 9.4 per cent in China, 16 per cent in the UK and 18 per cent in the US.
This shows woefully low financial inclusion in the India growth story, he added.
Noting that increasing retail penetration requires a big thrust of investor awareness at the grass-root level, he said it is the FIIs who are really benefiting from the country’s well-regulated equity markets.
According to Parekh, it is estimated that over the past one year, net FII buying of Indian equities exceeded domestic buying by a ratio of 10:1.
Parekh also said that India currently has “exceptionally good conditions” in place to aspire for 10 per cent economic growth but much needs to be done to achieve that target.
While stating that a 10 per cent GDP growth was certainly achievable, Parekh, however, said he would not “hazard a guess” on the time frame for achieving a double-digit growth.
“I try and think back and I can’t recall any other instance than now when India had rising stock markets, falling oil prices and a stable, majority government, all at the same time.
“These are exceptionally good conditions to once again lay the foundation for the much-aspired 10 per cent GDP growth for India,” he said.
Parekh, who has been known for his candid views on issues related to Indian economy and markets, said it is “suffice to say that 10 per cent GDP growth in India will not happen without extensive judicial, electoral, police, labour and land reforms, along with financial sector reforms.”
“At this juncture, much needs to be done to even attain a 6.5-7 per cent GDP growth rate.
“But yes, the picture had changed dramatically for India,” he said, while listing out three fundamental changes including improved confidence with the government being perceived as being able to deliver on growth and what is driving the present euphoria.
For the current fiscal, Parekh said the estimated GDP growth rate was 5.5-5.9 per cent, while adding that India has been performing significantly better than many other emerging markets.
He said research analysts are already describing India as being on the top among the BRICs and the “best house” in a bad neighbourhood.
“And to borrow the latest buzz phrase from Bill Gross, India is considered the ‘cleanest dirty shirt’ amongst emerging markets,” he said, while adding that India has become the toast of the FII party as it is perceived as ‘less of a mess’ in comparison.
Parekh said that FIIs have invested USD 37 billion so far this year, including around USD 14 billion in equities and debt inflows of USD 23 billion.
“And while another new high of 28,000 has been touched, brokerage houses have long since sent the Sensex forecast sky high,” he added.

1975 L N Mishra murder case: Court fixes Dec 8 for verdictPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 4:38 pm
A Delhi court today fixed December 8 for pronouncement of verdict in a case relating to the murder of former Railway Minister L N Mishra at a function in Bihar nearly 40 years ago.
District Judge Vinod Goel, who had reserved the verdict for today, deferred it saying the judgement was not ready.
“Judgement not ready yet. Put up for December 8,” the judge said.
After hearing the final arguments of the counsel for CBI and the four accused on September 12, the court had reserved its judgement for today. The final arguments had begun in September, 2012.
The case relates to the bomb blast at a function attended by Mishra at Samastipur Railway Station on January 2, 1975. He succumbed to injuries the next day.
Over 200 witnesses, including 161 prosecution witnesses and more than 40 defence witnesses, were examined in the case.
Advocate Ranjan Dwivedi, who was 24-year-old at that time, was named as an accused along with four Ananda Marga group members, one of whom has died.
Apart from Dwivedi, three other accused in the case are Santoshananda Avadhuta, Sudevananda Avadhuta and Gopalji.
The accused had earlier approached the Supreme Court for quashing of the trial against them in the murder case.
The apex court had on August 17, 2012 dismissed their pleas on the ground that the proceedings could not be quashed merely because they had not been concluded in the last 37 years.
The charge sheet in the case was filed on November 1,1977 in a CBI court in Patna. The case was shifted to Delhi in 1979 on a plea by the then Attorney General to the apex court.
Except Gopalji, all those listed in the charge sheet in Mishra murder case were also named as accused in an attempt to murder case related to the bid on the life of then Chief Justice of India A N Ray in Delhi on March 20, 1975.

Twelve-day Mizoram assembly session to start Tuesday  delayed budget and four bills to be tabledPrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: November 10, 2014 5:31 pm
Four bills and a delayed budget is set to be tabled before the house as the Mizoram Legislative Assembly begins its 12-day winter session starting Tuesday.
The session will finally see a full-fledged budget presented before legislators by Finance Minister Lalsawta after two vote-on-accounts of state finances in earlier sessions were necessitated by a delayed release of funds by the Centre. Mizoram depends on more than 90 percent of it’s finances on New Delhi.
Debates about the budget is likely to be stormy since the opposition parties have been raising the issue of the government’s “financial mismanagement” even as it has been reported that the salary component of the plan-fund has been axed to just half of last year’s, a much-discussed issue since the government is the largest employer in the state which has half it’s working population in the tertiary sector.
The Finance Minister has of late also spoken several times on the need to raise taxes to meet government expenses.
The upcoming session will also see the tabling of four important state bills, including one to regulate marriages, divorce and inheritances among residents and another for the setting up of a Lokayukta.
Various bodies including the powerful Mizo Students’ Association, also known as MZP, have been pressing for the setting up of a Lokayukta for years.
As many as 244 starred questions and 49 unstarred questions and two resolutions, including one for the ratification of the National Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2014, have also been submitted.

Bihar CM Manjhi targets BJP over corruption and rape chargesLetters to  the editor
Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi today hit back at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been demanding his resignation in the wake of the controversial appointment of his son-in-law, saying the saffron party had given important posts to people facing corruption and rape charges.
“Why shall I resign? The BJP, which is asking for my resignation, should first answer about giving important posts to people like Y S Yeduruppa and even those facing vigilance cases and rape charges,” Manjhi told reporters on the sidelines of a ‘Janata ke Darbar Mein Mukhya Mantri’ programme at his residence.
He, however, refused to identify the BJP leader facing rape charges and vigilance cases.
On the controversial appointment of his son-in-law Devendra Kumar as his Personal Assistant (PA) against rules, Manjhi accepted it was a “mistake due to lack of information” which was corrected once his attention was drawn to it.
“The chapter is closed now,” he said.
Senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and other party leaders had demanded Manjhi’s resignation over the issue.
Manjhi also rubbished reports of “differences” with his predecessor Nitish Kumar.
“He is running the party (JD-U) and I am running the government,” he said.
Asked if he would be part of Kumar’s ‘Samparak Yatra’ starting from November 13, the Chief Minister said, “It’s a party programme where I cannot go as a CM. But, if party workers demand my presence anywhere, I will be happy to be there.”
Manjhi, who had a nearly two hour-long meeting with Kumar on November 7 amid reports of a growing distance between the two leaders, said he received “tips” from Kumar for running the government more effectively.
Dismissing reports of Kumar avoiding to share dais with him as wrong, he said Nitish could not attend some of the functions with him due to personal reasons and prior engagements.
Asked if the JD(U) and the RJD should merge in the wake of efforts to bring old the Janata parivar together, Manjhi said, “Leaders like Sharad Yadav, Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar can comment on such issues, not me.”
He, however, stressed on an alliance between JD(U), RJD and Congress in the coming Assembly elections to repeat the performance of the recent by-elections in which they won six seats out of ten.

Maha Assembly session starts; Sena shuns BJPLetters to  the editor
Shiv Sena legislators today occupied Opposition benches as the special three-day session of Maharashtra Assembly began here during which Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will seek a trust vote as mandated by the Governor when he stakes claim to form the government.
Sena members, wearing saffron pheta (headgear) came to Legislative Assembly in a group and occupied the benches meant for Opposition, where their seating arrangement was made, in keeping with the norms for the second largest party in the 288-member House.
Earlier today, before the House proceedings began at 11 AM, Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao administered the oath as Protem Speaker to senior legislator Jeeva Pandu Gavit, at Raj Bhavan.
Gavit then administered the oath to newly elected members of the House. The process will continue tomorrow. On November 12, the last day of the session, election for the Speaker will be held.
Shiv Sena sources said that the party was likely to field its nominee for the post.
While senior Sena leader Neelam Gorhe told reporters at Legislative Assembly today that her party was at present not involved in any talks with BJP.
Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had yesterday announced that the party will sit in Opposition if BJP accepted NCP’s support to win the trust vote.
Uddhav has given BJP two days to respond, before taking a final decision.
Senior Sena leader Diwakar Raote today said Sena MLAs will present a green skull cap to Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse for “espousing” the cause of Urdu language in Marathi medium schools.
Today was the first day as MLA for former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and education minister Vinod Tawde, who were earlier members of the Legislative Council.
While some members invoked God before taking oath, there was a member who said “Jai Vidarbha” while there was another who said “Namo” while taking oath.

Giriraj Singh s inclusion crisp slap to secularismCongress today took potshots at Narendra Modi’s ministry expansion saying the inclusion of BJP leader Giriraj Singh was a “crisp slap” by the Prime Minister to secularism.
The party said that the expansion was “far more” of caste, geography and less on merit.
Singh’s inclusion in the government is a “crisp slap by Modi to secularism and inclusion”, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.
Priyanka Chaturvedi, a Congress leader and panelist tweeted, “Am certain the way things are going Giriraj Singh will take charge as MoS MEA, to facilitate all Modi haters to move to Pakistan. Strategic.”
Singh had earlier this year made a controversial statement that those opposing Modi should go to Pakistan for which he was also pulled up by the party leadership.
Congress General Secretary and in-charge of party’s Communication Department, Ajay Maken tweeted,”Took 6 MONTHS for Full Time Defense/Security, Power, Rural Development, Surface Transport, Environment #ModiKeMantri OR Wait Who knows even now?”
Referring to the Supreme Court’s order that the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers should desist from appointing tainted people as ministers, Maken tweeted, “27 Aug SC Decision-Expected 13 Tainted Min removal But New Tainted Min added- Affidavit shows 23 cases. Modi Ji What about #SwachhPolitics?”
Congress leader Digvijay Singh tweeted, “Why so much excitement about Cabinet Expansion? Modi doesn’t require a Cabinet. His is a ONE MAN CABINET ! Ask Rajnath Ji and Gadkari Ji!”
Singhvi also said, “The Sunday shuffle, if numerically analysed, has far more of caste & geography & far less of merit. To be fair, Cong also sometimes did same”.

This week: Macy s leads retail profit paradeEMAIL
Bust out your wallet. You’re going to need it this week.
Key big retailers report quarterly earnings this week. The holidays around the corner. Investors are paying close attention to see if cash registers are jingling.
Macy’s (M) kicks off the retail earnings parade — Wednesday. Are Macy’s efforts getting consumers in the door working? Discounts have been one lure. Can volume make up for lower prices? Analysts expect the company to report 8.5% higher profit. That’s one of the better showings among retailers.
Thursday is even bigger. Wal-Mart (WMT) , Kohl’s (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) all report. Wal-Mart’s is known for low prices. But lately, investors know Wal-Mart for low profit growth. Heavy investment in e-commerce is a profit drag now. Earnings are seen falling 1.8% during the quarter. Wal-Mart is rated a “hold” by analysts. Over at Kohl’s, it’s a similar situation. Earnings are seen dropping 8.6%.
Perhaps the high-end can bail out retail. Nordstrom is a bright spot. The retailer’s earnings are seen rising 4% on 8% higher revenue of $3 billion, says S&P Capital IQ.
Retail not your thing? There are still 55 stocks in the S&P 500 that haven’t reported. Tech stock Cisco Systems (CSCO) is one of them. Just don’t expect much. Analysts see this former high-tech darling posting no profit growth.
Guess you’re better off at the mall.

Assad says ready to study UN plan to freeze AleppofightingBy: Press Trust of India | Posted: November 10, 2014 7:31 pm
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said today he was ready to study a UN plan to “freeze” fighting in the northern city of Aleppo, a statement from his office said.
“President Assad has been informed by (UN envoy Staffan) de Mistura of the main points of his initiative,” said the statement issued after the two men held talks in Damascus.
“(Assad) said it was worthy of study and that work on it is needed… in order to re-establish security in Aleppo,” it added.
It is De Mistura’s second visit to Syria since he was appointed peace envoy in July.
On October 30, De Mistura put forward an “action plan” for Syria that proposed to “freeze” fighting in local areas to allow for aid deliveries and to lay the groundwork for peace talks.
According to the Syrian presidency Facebook page, Assad emphasised “the importance of Aleppo”, which rebels and the army have been fighting over since July 2012.
State news agency SANA, meanwhile, quoted De Mistura as saying he was determined to ensure that his mission succeeds.
De Mistura had previously said Aleppo would be a “good candidate” to become a “freeze” zone.
The city has been split into rebel- and army-held areas since a major insurgent offensive began there.
Since December 2013, regime warplanes have carried out near daily air raids targeting rebel-held districts of what was once Syria’s economic capital, reportedly killing mostly civilians, defying a UN Security Council ban on such strikes.

Will highlight issue of cooperation against blackmoney at G20: PMModiPrint
"A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against blackmoney," said Modi. (Source: PTI)
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 7:16 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 7:23 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the importance of global cooperation against blackmoney will be a “key issue” he will highlight at the upcoming G20 summit in Brisbane, as he embarks on a three-nation visit from Tuesday.
Seeking to inject momentum in the country’s ‘Act East’ policy, Modi will undertake the 10-day visit of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji to attend key multilateral summits and undertake bilateral meetings during which India is expected to push for steps to create more jobs and improve world economy.
“A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against blackmoney,” Modi said in a pre-departure statement.
As India attempts to unearth blackmoney stashed abroad, Modi is expected to renew the country’s commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
In the statement, Modi said during the course of the ASEAN-India and East Asian summits in Myanmar Capital Nay Pyi and at the G20 summit in Brisbane and bilateral visits to Australia and Fiji he will meet over 40 leaders from countries representing Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and Pacific Region.
At the annual summit of the Group of 20 of the world’s biggest developed and emerging economies, Modi said he intends to dicuss how it can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure, and ensure access to clean and affordable energy. The two-day summit will be held from November 15. G-20 accounts for 85 per cent of the world’s economic output.
During his foreign tour, Modi will undertake a bilateral visit for talks with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott in Canberra after the G20 summit.
Modi will be the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986.
“While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential.
A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India’s economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood,” he said referring to his four-city, three-day visit from November 16 that covers Melbourne and Sydney besides Melbourne and Canberra.

India will cross 6 pct GDP growth in 2015-16: Jayant SinhaNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Expressing confidence that India will cross 6 per cent GDP growth in 2015-16, the new Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha today said the priority of the government will be job creation and inflation management.
“We are expecting the growth to pick up and be on the accelerating trajectory. Hopefully we will cross 6-6.5 per cent next year,” Sinha told reporters soon after taking charge.
He further said the economy will return to 7-8 per cent sustainable growth trajectory in the coming years.
The economic growth slumped to 4.7 per cent in 2013-14 and is estimated to be between 5.4-5.9 per cent in current fiscal.
The 51-year old Sinha, an IIT-Delhi and Harvard alumnus, was inducted as the Minister of State during the expansion of Union Council of Ministers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday.
Sinha also expressed hope that the government will be able to push the Insurance Bill and the Constitutional amendment bill on Goods and Services Tax (GST) during the Winter session of Parliament beginning November 24.
Referring to the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, which seeks to raise FDI cap in the sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, he said: “when it comes to Parliament we are confident that we will get the support that we require”.
As regards GST, Sinha said: “that itself has gone through years and years of preparation and consensus building … We are sure will be able to show some positive results in this session”.
On fiscal situation, he said, it was well in hand and the government is monitoring the situation very closely with respect to tax collections.
Referring to the priorities of the government, he said they have already been articulated by the Prime minister and the Finance Minister.
“First, creating jobs is very important for us and for the economy. The second area that we have emphasised and we have done well on is obviously managing inflation and price rise, which has been a major election issue and I think we have done remarkably well on that,” Sinha said, adding it was necessary to get the investment cycle moving.
Earlier, he was briefed by senior officials in the Ministry soon after taking charge. He assumes office at a time when the Ministry is preparing the Budget for 2015-16.
“We have been fortunate to have tailwinds of lower oil prices which are going to help on the expenditure side. So when we take into account we are very confident that we will be able to achieve our fiscal targets,” he said.
Sinha was elected to the Lok Sabha in May this year from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand.
His career has seen him work as an investment fund manager and management consultant.

Public sector banks employees to hold strike on WedPublic sector banks employees to hold strike on Wednesday
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 10, 2014  | 20:49 IST
Normal banking operations such as cheque clearance in public sector banks across the country are likely to be hit on Wednesday as employees have decided to go on one-day nation-wide strike to press for wage revision.
"In negotiations held today, Indian Banks Association (IBA) stuck to its earlier stand of 11 per cent (wage hike) despite unions scaling down their demand to 23 per cent. Consequently, the conciliation ended in failure," United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) Convener M V Murali told PTI.
Hence, the call for strike on November 12 stands, he added.
"We have scaled down our demand from 25 per cent to 23 per cent, but IBA is not yielding. It has been sticking to its earlier offer of 11 per cent which is not enough," Ashwini Rana, General Secretary of National Organisation of Bank Workers, said.
Banks, including the country's largest one SBI, have already informed customers about the inconvenience they are likely to face on Wednesday.
"UFBU has given a notice to IBA calling for nationwide bank strike on the November 12 and All-India State Bank Officers Federation and All-India State Bank of India Staff Federation being a part of UFBU will also participate in the said strike," SBI said in a statement.
"Since the said call is given at all-India level covering all banks, the bank will not be impacted separately," the statement said.
Monday's meeting before the Chief Labour Commissioner ended in a deadlock so unions would go on with strike call, All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) General Secretary C H Venkatachalam said.
The staff of public sector banks had gone on a nationwide strike for two days beginning February 10 after discussions with the IBA had failed.
The wage revision of public sector bank employees has been due since November, 2012.
The UFBU is an umbrella organisation of nine bank employee and officer unions.
There are 27 public sector banks in the country with a combined employee strength of about 8 lakh. There are about 50,000 branches of these banks across the country.

Emails Paint Damning Picture Of GM s Handling Of RecallGM Ordered New Switches Months Before It Told Regulators About Issue: WSJ
Reuters
reddit
NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - General Motors Co ordered half a million replacement ignition switches almost two months before it alerted federal safety regulators of the issues that prompted a recall of millions of vehicles, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing email exchanges between the automaker and its supplier Delphi Automotive Plc.
The email exchanges, which took place in mid-December 2013 between a GM contract worker and Delphi, indicate GM placed an "urgent" order for 500,000 replacement switches on Dec. 18, a day after a meeting of senior executives, the newspaper said. GM announced its recall in February 2014. (http://on.wsj.com/142qQhn)
Representatives for GM and Delphi Automotive did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment on the matter.
"This is simply mind-blowing in its raw evilness," said Bob Hilliard, lead counsel for the personal injury and wrongful death plaintiffs in the Federal Multi District Litigation against General Motors.
"GM should have notified its customers immediately to take all weight off of their keychains. By the time GM actually ordered these parts, it had to have already spent months making the decision to place the order," Hilliard said in a statement.
GM has faced criticism for waiting 11 years to begin recalling millions of cars with ignition-switch problems that have been linked to fatalities. The switch in question can slip out of position, stalling the vehicle and disabling air bags. The defect led to the recall of 2.6 million vehicles earlier this year.
So far, 61 claims have been deemed eligible for compensation, including 30 deaths and 31 injuries.
A federal judge in Manhattan has set Jan. 11, 2016, for the first trial in consolidated litigation against General Motors over a series of safety issues, including a faulty ignition switch.

GSPC reduces PNG prices for Gujarats industrial customers by Rs 2 perscmPrint
By: Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 10, 2014 8:36 pm
GSPC Gas Company Ltd, a subsidiary of the state-run Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC), has decided to cut the prices of piped natural gas (PNG) for industries in the state by Rs 2 per standard cubic meter (SCM) from November 16 onwards.
The prices will be reduced to Rs 39.65 from the earlier Rs 41.65 per SCM (exclusive of taxes). “This reduction is being brought about after taking into consideration the prevailing prices of natural gas in the international market,” stated a release from the company.
GSPC Gas supplies 3.8-4 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of PNG to over 1900 industrial customers in clusters of Vapi, Umargaon, Sarigam, Bilimora, Gundlav, Morai, Navsari, Hazira, Valsad, Dahej, Gandhinagar, Karjan, Rajkot, Surendranagar-Wadhwan, Halol, Morbi, Nadiad, Thangadh, Palej, Khambhat and Petlad.
However, the company had increased the PNG prices for it’s domestic customers to Rs 24.83 per Standard Cubic Meter or SCM (without taxes) from Rs 23.50 on November 1. “We get the gas for our PNG (domestic) and CNG consumers form the Government of India. The prices of this segment was raised after the government raised the prices,” said a senior official from the company.
“Meanwhile, the natural gas that we get for the industrial customers is from the international market, which includes both spot and long-term procurements,” the official added.

Wagah a crystalline  horrible symbol of whats wrong with Pakistan: Former US Deputy Secretary ofStatePrint

Strobe Talbott, former US Deputy Secretary of State who now heads the Brookings Institution think tank, tells Rakesh Sinha why China’s assertiveness in the region is worrisome, why no sensible American must think of India as an ally
As someone who has engaged and tracked India very closely, what are your first impressions of the Modi government?
My sense is that President Obama and Prime Minister Modi hit it off quite well and that doesn’t surprise me, knowing a little bit about my own President and having heard some things about your Prime Minister. They are both highly pragmatic, they don’t go in for ceremony for its own sake, they are sort of get-things-done guys. They tend to get down as quickly as possible to the basic issues, see if they have a common view and then figure a way to maximize collaboration between the two countries.
The mood in the American private sector is a mirror of the mood in the private sector here. Americans who are interested in investing in India, trading with India, take seriously the Prime Minister’s stated and restated commitment to streamlining the process, making India investment-friendly and essentially getting the mojo back into the economy.
So their talks would have factored a greater Indian role in the region?
My impression was that keeping in mind or within the limits of some differences, there was nonetheless a meeting of minds on some big questions, particularly having to do with neighbours or near neighbours.
The three big issues that preoccupy the US right now are all in regions closer to India than to United States. By that I mean ISIS which is accompanied by a larger crisis in the Middle East; Russia and its annexation of Crimea, its use of force to dominate Ukraine and intimidate its neighbours; and then, there is the worrisome assertiveness of the People’s Republic of China with regard to neighbours, particularly neighbours with which it has maritime, territorial disputes. And as the PLA made very clear at the time of President Xi Jinping’s visit to New Delhi, that includes India big time.
I think particularly on ISIS and China, there was agreement that these were issues that were not only unsettling political stability in their immediate regions but were of real concern to the US and Indian governments. I think there was a common view on the nature of the problem and a desire to have the two governments consult and see if they can concert in some ways their policies. That does not mean India will join the coalition currently in force against ISIS. I think there are other ways India can contribute to what is common cause.
How different do you think will this government be from the NDA government you dealt with?
I think there is a structural difference which is very much to the advantage of the new government – it is a single-party government. That leaves the Prime Minister a degree of freedom to concentrate on continued…

Former separatist leader Sajjad Lone pleasantly surprised after meeting PMModiPrint

Written by Muzamil Jaleel | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 8:12 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 3:31 pm
Former separatist and Peoples Conference leader Sajjad Lone seemed to have been bowled over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after a 45-minute meeting at the PM’s residence here this evening.
“I cannot tell you how humble he is. He was talking as if I was the Prime Minister and not him. It was like two brothers talking to each other,’’ Lone told The Indian Express later. “The meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes but he spent a full 45 minutes with me. I went inside at 4.30 pm, there were only two of us. He was extremely warm to me.”
Lone said that Modi didn’t speak to him about the elections at all. “He (Modi) spoke freely. He told me that he would take a personal interest in Kashmir. He said I didn’t go to Kashmir four times until now because of politics. He told me that he truly wants Kashmiris to live a life of happiness and dignity and that he will keep on going to Kashmir.’’
“I talked to him about the problems with flood relief and he said that he (Modi) was personally monitoring it. He said trust me on this — I will restore Kashmir to its glory…I told him you did so much in Kutch in Gujarat and why can’t similar projects be introduced in Kashmir. He told me when it comes to development, I know how to achieve things – wait for a little while and then see whether there is change or not,’’ Lone said.
Lone said he didn’t raise contentious issues like Article 370 or the peace process. “I only told him that he should use his good offices so that people can live with dignity…I asked why couldn’t government of India make Srinagar a smart city. He said it was a great idea but it has to go through a process. I told him about the need of a highway connecting north Kashmir which could only become a reality if it is done under a Central scheme – he promised to discuss it…When I talked about need for urbanization and tourism infrastructure, there was a hint of excitement in his eyes,’’ he said.
The Modi-Lone meeting comes after a long BJP courtship, part of the party’s plan to stitch up a possible post-poll alliance of smaller parties and individuals in the Kashmir Valley where the BJP has little presence. While the BJP’s J&K poll plan hinges on the Hindu-majority seats among Jammu’s 37 Assembly constituencies, Lone and a few other free-floating politicians and parties are part of BJP’s public relations blitzkrieg to exhibit the party’s reach into the Muslim-majority Valley.

Ask Google why they want a big, Nexus 6 size phone, and the answer is ready: “We are moving from mobile first to a mobile only world.”
The next wave of growth for the smartphone industry will come from emerging nations in Asia-Pacific, especially from India, China and Indonesia. In these nations, smartphones will be the only computer for a majority of the population, so, the industry must gear up to accommodate this new breed.
At Google’s annual Asia-Pacific press event in Taipei this week, the search and advertising giant which seems to be nurturing increasing ambitions of becoming a device player, concentrated on this mobile first world. Google thinks the “most exciting computing revolution of our time, the mobile web,” is being forged in Asia.
“Asia will be the new market for this new (mobile only) change. The demand for smartphones with larger screens in on the rise as for most first-time smartphone buyers, it is there only computer. So, the industry needs to design products accordingly,” said Executive chairman Eric Schmidt delivering a keynote via Google Hangouts from Japan.

Not long ago, smartphones with 5-inch screens were considered to be ‘big’. Now, the same ‘big’ smartphones are almost standard, especially in India.
“I personally prefer the Nexus 5 and feel that the Nexus 6 is a big phone…but then big phones are the future,” said Schmidt.
Commenting on the fate of tablet PCs, Schmidt said, “If you already own a 6-inch smartphone (or phablet) then tablets will have to get better and deliver much more. Smartphones can primarily empower developing nations in improving safety of citizens and quality of education.”

“Those users will buy a smartphone as their only computer, for them a large screen betters the experience be it for playing games, taking notes, browsing the Internet or watching movies,” said Chris Yerga, APAC Engineering VP, Google Play.
On the Android application front, Yerga said, “Asian developers lead the race in Google Play and this region will help us predict the future of the rest of the world.”

Possible Oldest-Ever Photograph of a Person Found
Wikimedia Commons
A simple black and white photo could be the first ever photograph to capture the image of a person.
Dating back to 1838, the picture was taken by Louis Daguerre, inventor of the famed daguerreotype style of photography, according to Mashable and Retronaut .
The picture shows a large street scene in Paris with a man on the corner getting his shoe shined. To capture the image, Daguerre had to leave the exposure open for around seven minutes.
It was such a long exposure that the rest of the bustling street scene, which likely would have included traffic and pedestrians, has disappeared because it moved too fast for the camera to capture on film.
As a result, the single man in the picture appears to be getting his shoes shined in an abandoned Paris street.

Actress Keira Knightley, who recently posed nude from the waist up for Interview magazine, told The Times of London that she's OK posing topless in front of the camera, but won't allow her image to be changed by Photoshop.
"I've had my body manipulated so many different times for so many different reasons, whether it's paparazzi photographers or for film posters. And that [shoot] was one of the ones where I said: OK, I'm fine doing the topless shot so long as you don't make them any bigger or retouch.' Because it does feel important to say it really doesn't matter what shape you are."
The sexy spread was shot by French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier, whom Knightley also interviewed for the article.

Crime Drug Trafficking Cyber Crime Silk Road Tor Civil and Human Rights Bitcoin
U.S. and European authorities on Friday announced the seizure of more than 400 secret website addresses and arrests of 16 people in a sweep targeting black markets for drugs and other illegal services.
The developments were announced a day after prosecutors in New York unveiled criminal charges against the alleged operator of underground online drug marketplace Silk Road 2.0.

U.S. authorities called the global sweep the largest law enforcement action to date against illegal websites operating on the so-called Tor network, which lets users communicate anonymously by masking their IP addresses.
Tor, which was created by U.S. Navy researchers to protect the anonymity of national security communications, is used by human rights activists, criminals and others looking to evade surveillance.
Europol, in a statement, said U.S. and European cyber crime units, in a sweep across 18 countries, had netted $1 million worth of Bitcoin, the digital currency, 180,000 euros in cash, silver, gold and narcotics.
The more than 400 websites and domains seized on Thursday existed on the Tor network and were used by dozens of online marketplaces where such things as child pornography, guns and murder-for-hire could be purchased, authorities said.
Sixteen people operating illegal sites were arrested in addition to the defendant in the Silk Road 2.0 case, Europol added, without specifying the charges.
"As illegal activity online becomes more prevalent, criminals can no longer expect that they can hide in the shadows of the 'dark web,'" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.
On Thursday, U.S. authorities said they had shut down Silk Road 2.0, a successor website to underground online drugs marketplace Silk Road.
Blake Benthall, the alleged operator of Silk Road 2.0, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit drug trafficking, computer hacking, money laundering and other crimes.
Troels Oerting, head of Europol's cybercrime center, said the operation knocked out a significant part of the infrastructure for illegal online drugs and weapons trade in the countries involved.
"We have also hit services on the Darknet using Tor where, for a long time, criminals have considered themselves beyond reach," he said. "We can now show that they are neither invisible nor untouchable."
The websites had complete business models, Oerting said, and displayed what they sold, including drugs, weapons, stolen credit cards.
"People paid, and they delivered by the mailman," Oerting said. "There was even a ranking system for reliable suppliers."

Twitter, women's advocacy group team up to fight online harassment
Twitter is teaming up with a women's advocacy group to fight female harassment on the popular social media platform.
As threats of violence and sexual harassment aimed at women in the gaming community have escalated, so too has the mainstream attention -- and for good reason. Internet trolls have increasingly turned to online movements like "gamergate" as a tool to organize massive smear campaigns that target... ( Susan Rohwer )
Users will be able to report the specific types of abuse they are experiencing, including "whether someone has made an impostor account, is sending them violent threats, is using Twitter to encourage people to harass the person offline, or any of other several defined categories."
Twitter's move comes at a time when national conversation has shifted toward the harassment of women online. Discussions have been fueled by "GamerGate" -- an ongoing controversy that has included death threats, as well as threats of rape and violence, against women who are vocal about the perceived sexism in mainstream video games.

Weekend Roundup: 25 Years After the Fall of the Berlin Wall  Is the World Dividing into Blocs Againreddit
The world is at a tipping point. Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ensuing rise of China and other emerging economies, fragile institutions -- the Asia Pacific Economic Community summit taking place in Beijing and the G-20 in a few days in Brisbane -- are trying to hold the links of peace and prosperity together. Will these efforts to build a new order based on a convergence of interests win out over dis-integration as Russia, China and the West embark on divergent paths that risk solidifying into opposing blocs?
In the WorldPost this week, Helmut Kohl , Germany's chancellor when the Berlin Wall fell, recalls his emotions during that historic time. Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble , who was instrumental in German reunification, writes about his country's "happiest year" in recent history. Writing from Vladivostok, Artyom Lukin remembers his Cold War childhood and laments the new wall rising between Russia and the West.  Writing from Beijing, Chinese strategist Chen Xiangyang argues that a new balance of power is emerging in Asia based on three pillars: the U.S. and Japan; China and Russia and ASEAN and India.
We also examine why the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev , feels betrayed by the West and recall the fall of the Berlin Wall and German unification through the words of key leaders at the time -- George H. W. Bush , Margaret Thatcher and François Mitterrand as well as Gorbachev.
German sociologist Manfred Wilke wonders what lessons his now unified country's post-Cold War generation will learn from past divisions. In a conversation marking the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Henry Kissinger says "Putin is not Stalin" but more in league with Peter the Great. (Watch the full video of his discussion here ). Writing from Moscow, Alexander Golts argues that Putin wants to regain the "respect" the Soviet Union had when Nikita Khrushchev was in charge back in the 1960s. In an interview, Zbigniew Brzezinski calls on President Barack Obama to launch a "new opening" to China as a way to balance Putin's Russia.
Turning to the Middle East, Egyptian Nobel laureate Ahmed Zewail reports on his meeting in Cairo with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, compares him to Anwar Sadat and argues that it would be a big mistake for the U.S. to cut aid to Egypt. Writing from Tunis, French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy , who persuaded then-President Nicolas Sarkozy to bomb Libya to protect rebels back in 2011, discusses the situation in that country still torn by violence today. WorldPost Middle East Correspondent Sophia Jones reports on the tribulations ahead for Syrian refugees as winter sets in.
Writing from New York, veteran political analyst Howard Fineman warns the world not to expect much from America now that it has been even further divided by the Republican sweep of the U.S. Congress in midterm elections. Though facing this political turbulence, Nouriel Roubini notes that for now the global economy is flying on one engine of growth -- the U.S. WorldPost China Correspondent Matt Sheehan heads to China's "Silicon Valley" to gauge whether the Middle Kingdom is also becoming a tech giant. Writing from Beijing, CCTV host Tian Wei says China "can and must" close its gender gap.
Alexis Crow writes from London that falling oil prices are revealing the "fracking trap" that lurks behind America's recent energy boom.
From Mexico City, Televisa news anchor Carlos Loret de Mola writes that for all of President Enrique Pena Nieto's notable reforms in telecoms and energy, he has left out the key element -- judicial reform and the rule of law -- which the country now demands after the disappearance of 43 students.
Writing from Paris, Diane Ducret explores why women are always the scapegoat when troubled societies turn to moralists for answers. Lord David Owen takes a clinical look at the personality disorders of political leaders -- above all, the affliction of hubris.
Finally, "The Black Box Society" author Frank Pasquale chronicles how "big data" can ruin your reputation and career.

Women in Business: Julie Jakobek  Managing Director and Executive Producer  JA Digitalreddit
Julie has over 23 years experience in TV, DVD and online productions. Before co-founding JA Digital , she was Head of Multi-Camera at Done & Dusted for a very successful 8 years. During this time she Produced and Executive Produced most of their multi camera events including Madonna in London, Coldplay in Sydney & Toronto, Amy Winehouse in London, Mika in Paris, Gorillaz in New York, Robbie Williams in Manchester & London, Simply Red in Havana plus many others.
A major player, Julie has been involved in numerous award-wining projects and has been Grammy nominated twice. A world renowned expert in large scale events, she has filmed all over the globe including the USA, UK, Europe, Syria, Australia, Cuba and Japan among others.
Julie also has substantial experience producing access documentaries including Eddie Irvine Living The Life (C4), Prince Naseem Little Prince, Big Fight (C4), Damon Hill Fight For Victory (DVD) plus the multi-award winning current affairs special Convoy To Moldova for the BBC.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?
I'm not sure where my drive and ambition comes from but it's something that grows and grows and is showing no signs of fading. I am fiercely proud and passionate about the films and content I create with the wonderful teams I work with. Strangely enough, I trained to be a nurse when I first left school and dealt with every kind of emergency, which has enabled me to remain calm and focused in challenging situations. It has also given me an ability to read people well and see situations from other peoples point of view, not just my own. I have used these qualities in my business relationships.
How has your previous employment experience aided your position at JA Digital?
Before co-founding JA digital, I had produced and Exec produced multiple projects across multiple genres including lots of live music films, access documentaries, entertainment shows and even an award-winning current affairs documentary. I had worked with artists including Coldplay, Madonna, Gorillaz, Amy Winehouse, Placebo, Robbie Williams, Oasis, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kylie and sport stars including Eddie Irvine, Damon Hill, Prince Nazeem, Lennox Lewis and have filmed extensively around the world from the UK and US to Australia, Cuba, Europe, Japan, Lebanon, Turkey and even Syria. I have managed a wide range of budget and projects and teams and learnt from every project and experience. I have been extremely fortunate to work with the best possible creative's and have learnt from them all. I'm also a firm believer that even the toughest of situations or projects, or people (!) is an opportunity to learn and develop.
What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at JA Digital?
The wonderful people I have and continue to work with and the wonderful films we have created.
What advice can you offer women who are seeking to start their own business?
Hold you nose and jump in! You'll never truly know if you can do it until you try. I got the point where it was something I just had to do. I felt my biggest future regret would be not to try. Build a good support system around you of professional advisers, mentors and friends in similar positions. I've gained so much by talking issues through with other like-minded company owners. At the end of the day you have to make your own decisions, but it's great to do that having talked things through objectively.
How do you maintain a work/life balance?
With a great deal of dedicated juggling. It's not always easy but of course my family and friends are my other great passion so a good work/life balance is essential for my personal happiness. Some weeks are better than others, but overall I'm happy with the balance in my life. One thing is you have to set your own limits; no one else will do it for you.
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?
I recently completed a Goldman Sachs business course and had a financial mentor who I would say has made the most difference in my understanding of business from a financial point of view. He really put me through my paces, which wasn't the most enjoyable of experiences but has left me with a deeper understanding of running a business from a financial point of view.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why?
I admire all leaders who run successful businesses whilst managing to keep family healthy and happy and find time for themselves. I also admire leaders who are able to nurture other people's careers and help them achieve their ambitions and dreams. This is something I strive for also.
What do you want JA Digital to accomplish in the next year?
To continue to grow and produce a wider range of films and content. To enable the wonderful teams of creative's, production teams and technicians we work with to achieve their personal goals whilst working on ground breaking and challenging projects.

Adapting to the New Way of Leadership Through Innovative Learning Programsreddit
I was fortunate enough to be part of Emergenetics 24 Hours recently, a very cool event featuring 24 thought leaders and professionals around the world, focused 100% on the power of people to make organizations better. There were 24 presentations on everything from leadership to communication to creativity. Over and over again, I heard speakers say that people are capable of remarkable things, but you must allow them to be remarkable in their own way. This approach is especially true with Millennials, who strongly desire a way to navigate their own path of performance. Check out this stunning graph on the trending workplace dynamic. Millennials currently make up over 33% of the workplace and that number is growing rapidly.
( Graph credit: Virtuali, Inc. )
Because I am a young professional and proud Millennial, I found great resonance in one speaker in particular from the North American line up. Sean Graber , the CEO and Co-Founder of the innovative firm Virtuali, Inc. , shared data indicating that the Millennial generation emphatically wants unique experiences and engagement in their work--two things that most are not necessarily finding in their current workplace. Sean provided a " wish list " that Millennials seek from their ideal job that includes things like: alignment with their company's mission, a career path that gives them the opportunity to work on interesting and varied projects, and international rotations and experiences.
For me, this list is spot on. I immediately made the connection to the surging trend of recent business school graduates opting out of traditional jobs like finance and accounting and opting in for high-tech firms , or smaller and more startup-like firms. High-tech firms and other creative organizations seem to understand the desires of Millennials, and as a result tend to place a higher emphasis on creating awesome places to work.
However, all hope is not lost for the more traditional jobs and firms on the quest to retain and engage talented young professionals. In fact, there are big opportunities to provide employees with enriching and valuable learning programs. In a study conducted by Virtuali, among the most desired programs by Millennials are coaching and mentoring, as you can see below.
By tailoring learning and development programs to fit the needs of the Millennial generation, organizations are likely to see dramatic increases in performance and engagement. That is a very good thing, because I believe Millennials have amazing capabilities and have the power to truly improve the world.
Here are a couple ideas on how to bring this new-age learning into your organization today:
Reverse Mentoring: We in the Millennial generation have a lot to learn...but we also have a lot to teach. Pair us up with older generations so we can benefit from each other.
Cognitively Diverse Coaching and Teamwork: Collaboration is huge for us (and for pretty much every company now). There are ways to team up that afford more excitement and greater potential for big results.
Finally, here are some great examples from the field. Programs like Go! Virtuali and Deloitte's D2i , create a fantastic way for companies to provide all of the things Millennials are desiring in their jobs--and more. Furthermore, these programs combine two things about which I am passionate: the importance of self-awareness and international experience. I look forward to how our generation will continually innovate in the learning, leadership and development spaces across all industries.

(Proposals for listing of…)
NEW DELHI: The IPO market has not been able to match the bullish sentiment in the overall equity space, but year 2015 may well be the year which will have something for retail investors.
The state-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) and national helicopter company Pawan Hans will be listed on the stock exchanges to improve transparency and efficiency, said a top government official on Monday. According to experts, the big bang announcement by the government are likely to keep the momentum alive for markets.
"The government has been providing positive and constructive news on a consistent basis in terms of both its vision and how it wishes to implement it. The changes the prime minister announced in his cabinet are quite exciting. I must say they are very good in terms of how the market sees it," says Ashok Wadhwa, MD & CEO, Ambit Holdings Pvt Ltd.
"So long as the government continues to take these administrative as well as legislative steps, the market will continue to receive these changes with a positive sentiment," he adds.
Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said that the privatisation of national carrier Air India will not happen immediately, but cannot be ruled out in future.
Proposals for listing of AAI and Pawan Hans have been made in the Draft Civil Aviation Policy , released by Raju here.
Pawan Hans Ltd was incorporated in 1985 and presently its shareholding comprises 51 per cent with the Government of India and 49 per cent with state-run ONGC, said a PTI report.
However, year 2014 has not been all that great for given the fact that as a little over Rs 1,000 crore was raised through public offers in the first half of 2014-15.
According to Prime Database, as many as 25 companies have collectively mopped up a meagre Rs 1,019 crore through initial public offers (IPOs) during the April-September period of the current fiscal (2014-15), PTI reported.
At present, five companies planning to raise Rs 1,240 crore are holding Sebi's approval and another 11 firms intending to mop up Rs 4,707 crore have filed draft documents with market regulator and are awaiting its approval.
We have collated list of top stock offering which are likely to come up in the next 12 months:
Infibeam to raise Rs 500-1000 crore via IPO
Infibeam mulls filing draft red herring prospectus by December as it gears up for its IPO next year. The Ahmedabad-based e-commerce company plans to file its draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) by December as it seeks to make its market debut next fiscal amid increased inflows into the country's consumer internet businesses.
Infibeam, which owns and operates e-commerce venture Infibeam.com and B2B e-commerce platform BuildABazaar, is looking to raise about Rs 500 crore -Rs 1,000 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), while targeting a market capitalisation of Rs 3,000 crore-Rs 4,000 crore.
The IPO, expected in 2015, will make Infibeam the first Indian e-commerce company to go public in the country. HomeShop18, which has al so announced plans to go public, has filed documents to list on the US exchanges.
Aster Health lines up 3 banks for Rs 1200 cr IPO
India's third-largest healthcare service provider Aster DM Healthcare has finalized three lead banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Kotak - to manage its Rs 1,200-crore initial public offering (IPO) scheduled for early next year.
The IPO is expected to value Aster at around Rs 12,000 crore, or $2 billion, possibly catapulting founder and Chairman Dr Azad Moopen onto the list of Indian billionaires and among the richest healthcare entrepreneurs. The company plans to sell 10% shares on the bourses though details of the same are not finalized yet.
This would be more than double the valuation of Fortis Healthcare, controlled by brothers Malvinder and Shivinder Singh , with Rs 5,581 crore ($907 million) in current market value.
Sadbhav's infra arm likely to file IPO papers by December
Sadbhav Infrastructure Project, a subsidiary of Mumbai-listed Sadbhav Engineering , is looking to list shares on the bourses in an initial public offering (IPO), which will see its parent offer 15 percent stake.
According to sources, Sadbhav Infra Project has appointed Kotak Mahindra Bank, Citi and ICICI Securities as managers to the issue and it file its draft red-herring prospectus with the securities regulator by December this year. Sadbhav Infra has 11 build-operate-transfer projects with total cost of Rs 7,850. Three out of the 11 projects are operational.
Matrix Partners & Avigo Capital planning to sell MIPS stakes via Rs 300 crore IPO
Private equity funds Matrix Partners and Avigo Capital plan to sell a part of their stake in education services provider Maharana Infrastructure and Professional Services or MIPS through a Rs 300 crore public offer that values the company at Rs 1,300 crore.
The PE funds are seeking a return of more than 2.5 times on their investments made between 2011 and 2012, according to people familiar with the matter. "The company is looking at rising around Rs 300 crore. PE investors will partly exit stake in the IPO," an investment banker said on condition of anonymity.
RBL Bank plans to launch IPO in next three quarters
RBL Bank , formerly known as Ratnakar Bank, plans to raise funds through an initial public offer which will hit the market in the next 8-9 months.
The quantum of offer has not been finalised by the board of the bank, he said, adding that the decision will be taken in the next few months after taking into account various factors including Basel III requirement.

MUMBAI: Rail stocks surged and ITC posted the biggest intraday gain in 14 months as the Narendra Modi-led BJP government's first cabinet reshuffle boosted investor confidence about the pace and intensity of the government's reform programme.
The benchmark broader indices rose to an all-time high in morning trade before slipping to end the day marginally higher but the limelight was clearly on railway infrastructure stocks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed a leading reformist Suresh Prabhu to head the railway ministry.
Rail stocks rose by up to 9% on Monday led by Texmaco Rail, which jumped 8.98% to Rs 108, Kalindee Rail, which climbed 8.10% to Rs 110, and Titagarh Wagons, up 3.6% to Rs 268. All these stocks outperformed the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap Index which ended flat.
Shares of ITC jumped 4.3% toRs 370 as traders speculated that the new health Minister JP Nadda may not pursue more tax increases for cigarette companies or curbs on their advertisement and marketing. But some analysts said that the government may sell stake in ITC, now being held by the Special Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI). This is ITC's biggest intraday percentage jump since September 2013.
"The government has been providing positive and constructive news on consistent basis in terms of both its vision and how it wishes to implement it. The changes in cabinet are quite exciting," says Ashok Wadhwa, MD & CEO, Ambit Holdings.
The Sensex rose as much as 159 points in the morning session to a record 28,027.96, its fifth all-time high in six sessions, before ending flat at 27,874.73. The Nifty ended at 8,344.25, up 7 points. FIIs bought equities worth Rs 355 crore on Monday while domestic institutions sold equities worth Rs 315 crore as per the BSE provisional figures.
Prabhu, whose family controls the Mumbai-based Saraswat Bank and who was a minister in the 1999-2004 NDA government, was appointed railway minister in the Modi cabinet despite the objections of Shiv Sena, his erstwhile party. He is widely reputed to be a reformist with strong execution skills. "I don't think the government will ease tax rates for cigarette companies such as ITC going forward.
We rather believe that the government may consider selling its stake in ITC as Prime Minister Modi is pushing for more reforms," said Vinod Nair, head, fundamental research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. Analysts say there are a lot of expectations that there will be policy reform oriented announcements going ahead such as formulation of tenders and upgradation of current infrastructure.
"Railway infrastructure related stocks have surged on renewed expectations that the new cabinet minister will intensify capital expenditure and launch new railway projects which will boost earnings of these companies. Market participants are expecting some radical reforms in the upcoming railway budget scheduled in February," said Pankaj Pandey, head of research at ICICI Direct.
In August this year, the new government had notified foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence and railways infrastructure with a limit of 49% and 100%, respectively, through the automatic route in several areas. The cabinet expansion has given concrete signal to the markets on the government's focus on infrastructure ministries, said investment managers.
The Modi-government announced plans to introduce bullet trains on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad route and a nationwide diamond quadrilateral project comprising high-speed trains. Freight and industrial corridors to improve the country's infrastructure and create employment are also being planned. Analysts say some of these projects may soon take off with the new minister assuming charge.
"There are strong expectations that railways will be further opened up to foreign investments while more emphasis will be given by government to boost infrastructure, which may lead to re-rating of select companies. We would like to advise investors to be selective while making their portfolio investments," said Devang Mehta, senior vice-president & head, equity advisory, at Anand Rathi.
Railway infrastructure related stocks have been market darlings for the last one year with Stone India rising 288%, BEML rising 227%, Texmaco Rail climbing 198%. Titagarh Wagons has climbed 155% in the same period.

25 Years After The Fall Of The Berlin Wall  These Barriers Are Still Standingreddit
On this day in 1989, residents of Berlin gathered on opposite sides of the concrete barrier that had divided them for nearly three decades and started tearing it down piece by piece. The wall that stood between East and West Berlin, between Communism and the West, would soon be no more.
But 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, barriers around the world are still standing. They separate communities, countries and even entire continents.
To mark the anniversary of the historic events of Nov. 9, HuffPost editors from around the world described the seemingly insurmountable barriers that still surround them to this day.
Leaders around the world, the time has come to tear down these walls.
THE BORDER FENCE
The Oct 23. picture featured below shows part of the 7.5 mile-fence in the city of Melilla that separates Spain from Morocco, Europe from Africa, prosperity from desperation. Ceuta, the other Spanish enclave in the Magreb, has its own barrier.
The separations were built in 1998 and at the time of construction they were simple, 2.5-meter tall cyclone fences, meant to control new arrivals of migrants, mostly from Sub-Saharan Africa. In the past years, successive governments have reinforced the fences: They have raised the height and added razor wire, several intermediate fences, sensors and detection cables, cameras, lights, etc…, that nonetheless don't dissuade those willing to risk everything to cross.
Many migrants try, but very few make it in the end. And there are other, more efficient methods to enter clandestinely. Not one migrant was able to cross the Ceuta fence in 2013, but 2,244 crossed the border by other means. In Melilla, where migrants often try to jump in groups, they had more success. Of the 2,638 that were able to enter Melilla illegally in 2013, more than 800 came across the barricade.
Spain's government has spent $72 million euros [$89 million] since 2005 to build and expand the two walls. The walls also seem impermeable to human rights, as humanitarian organizations like the European Council and the European Commission frequently complain. Footage has shown that the mistreatment of migrants. Immediate expulsions are habitual practices, as are the arguments from the government to justify this violation of national, international and European law.

TWO NATIONS
While Canada is known as a multicultural nation, it has long been divided between English and-French speaking parts of and the fight by Quebec separatists for independence.
The issue of Quebec independence made international headlines in 1995 when the province voted in its second referendum to secede from Canada. The 1995 vote was narrowly lost by the separatists and since then, the question has been on the back burner. Less than 40 percent of Quebecois currently support the idea of secession. The pro-independence provincial Parti Quebecois was thrown out of power last April after a 18-month rule.
There are other divisions that are part of the Canadian fabric. Disparities in riches between the provinces have created a "have" and "have not" division. And Canada’s aboriginal communities, known as First Nations, have been fighting for greater control of resources and governance. They've also been battling for reparations for past treatment.

THE ISLAND FEUD
In September 2010, a Chinese fishing trawler collided with two Japanese Coast Guard patrol boats in the waters off the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea. The clash over the Japan-controlled, China-claimed islands would bring  down an "iron wall" between both nations, the world's second and third largest economies.
In response to China’s growing assertiveness over maritime territorial disputes, the Japanese government nationalized three of the contested islands in 2012, prompting Bejing to halt all high-level discussions with Tokyo.
China has since insisted that no political rapprochement is possible until the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is willing to acknowledge the disputed status of the islands, and express remorse for Japanese actions in World War II. Japan, on the other hand, is unlikely to back down under Abe's nationalistic administration. The Japanese prime minister hopes to establish a "democratic security diamond" aligning Japan with like-minded countries such as Australia and India against Chinese aggression.
The territorial dispute has contributed to the worst period of Sino-Japanese relations since diplomatic ties were established in the 1970s. In a worrying escalation of the situation, China announced in November 2013 a unilateral Air Identification Zone (ADIZ) that overlaid parts of Japan's ADIZ.
However, in a hopeful sign, Japan's government announced on Nov. 7 that the country's prime minister will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit, which is scheduled to begin on Nov. 10 in Beijing.

THE KOREAN MDL
The barrier between North and South Korea is as high as ever.
Officially in a state of armistice, the two powers are separated by a 154-mile Military Demarcation Line (MDL). For the past 61 years -- 24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- heavily armed forces have stood face to face on both sides of the line.
Residents of the South and North cannot cross the mighty barrier freely and an absolute majority of South and North Koreans has never made the trip. Traveling across the border requires special authorization from the government, which is only granted on extremely rare occasions.
The barrier does not just separate Koreans physically. It's impossible to write letters or make phone calls to the other side of the MDL, a limitation that applies to the Internet as well. North Korean websites aren't even accessible from the South.
Many families have been separated during the chaos of the Korean War and have yet to be reunited. Some “separated families” lived for decades without knowing whether their family members were alive. Up until today, no one knows when they will be reunited.
After 60 years, the Koreas are no longer the one country they used to be. The social systems vastly defer from each other just as their cultures have grown apart. Even the spoken language started to develop differently.
These days, many South Koreans question whether unifications should still be a goal -- a question that was unfathomable back in the days. A significant number of southerners, especially from the younger generation, believe that unifying with the poverty-stricken North would be a huge economic loss.

"THE PEACE WALLS"
Like the Berlin Wall, the Cupar Way "Peace Wall" in Belfast has cut an urban landscape in half for decades. Unlike the Berlin Wall, it is regularly reviewed on Trip Advisor.
The wall, one of dozens that divide the capital of Northern Ireland, is listed as one of the city's top attractions. Bus and cab tours regularly stop by and encourage tourists to scrawl their own messages on it. It has stood for 45 years, 17 longer than the Berlin Wall.
"Conflict tourism" has become a big industry for Belfast in recent years, in the same way tourists in Berlin can visit Checkpoint Charlie or buy what peddlers insist is a piece of the wall. But in Northern Ireland, it reflects a disconnect between outsiders - be they politicians or tourists - and people living with very recent memories of the violence.
The decades of bloodshed, officially and euphemistically dubbed "The Troubles" but sometimes simply just "The War", is over. The walls may look like monuments to the past to be graffitied and photographed, but for the people living in their shadows, sectarian strife between Protestant Unionists, who want Northern Ireland to stay British, and Catholic Nationalists, who want it to join the Irish Republic, is not a thing of the past. A 2012 study showed almost 70 percent living in "interface areas" near the walls feared for their safety without them.
Put simply, the walls prevent crossing between Protestant areas on one side and Catholic communities on the other. Some walls restrict access completely, while others use gates with limited opening hours to restrict movement. Segregation is less intense than it was around the time the first peace walls were built in 1969, when the British Army was sent in to Northern Ireland to keep the peace after rioting and began building temporary fences.
It is often reported the number of peace walls has increased in the last 20 years. But their actual number depends on the method of counting. Northern Ireland's Department of Justice administers 53, but a study counted 99 in Belfast, where the vast majority are.

Belowe: Protestant Lee Young, 8, lives barely 200 yards from Cein, but they probably will never meet. Their communities in Belfast's west inner city are separated by a peace wall.

THE BORDER BARRIER
One of the few places on earth where the First and Third worlds touch, the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border was once a much more open place than it is today. In Texas, the border runs along the Rio Grande River, which bisects a string of towns that once belonged to Mexico. People with family roots on either side of sister cities like Brownville-Matamoros, Laredo-Nuevo Laredo, or El Paso-Ciudad Juárez crossed routinely to work, go to school or see loved ones.
Though much fluidity remains, U.S. officials have increasingly closed off the border following recurring waves of mass migration from Mexico that began the 1980s and lasted through the early 2000s. As millions of Mexicans entered the U.S., both legally and illegally, American officials erected fences and walls to keep migrants out. Today, more than 550 miles of border fencing have been laid.
The growth of fencing in the highly trafficked corridors in Texas and California pushed migrants hoping to cross the border illegally into the desert between the Mexican state of Sonora and the U.S. state of Arizona. The danger of crossing through the desert, U.S. officials reasoned, would deter migrants from crossing illegally.
They were wrong. More than 2,100 migrants have died trying to cross through the desert since 2001, a figure more than 15 times larger than the 136 people who lost their lives attempting to cross the Berlin Wall from 1961 until its destruction in 1989. In 2009, an analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union found the risk of death while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border was 17 times higher than it was 10 years earlier.
Despite the fact that apprehensions for illegal crossings -- one way of measuring flows of illegal immigration --  have plummeted to about a quarter of their 1986 peak of 1.7 million, the U.S. immigration debate in Congress continues to focus on committing more resources to militarize the border, with border hawks pressing for additional fencing.

The big bull market  is in pharma sector  say experts; top bets | Nifty ends @ all-time highThe big ‘bull’ market is in pharma sector, say experts; top bets

Aurobindo Pharma
(The S&P BSE Healthcare index…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Healthcare index has rallied nearly 50 per cent so far in the year 2014, compared to a 30 per cent rally seen in the BSE Sensex.
The rally in the pharma sector was led by gains in Dr Reddy's, Lupin, Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy Laboratories, which have rallied 30 per cent to 60 per cent so far in the tear 2014. However, Aurobindo Pharma has more than doubled investors' wealth in the same period.
Pharma stocks over the last one quarter have given extraordinary returns. And, there is a possibility that these stocks can correct and consolidate from these levels. However, that does not mean that it's time to cash out as the big bull market is here in pharma stocks, say experts.
"My view is that the biggest bull run in India is in pharma. We have seen nothing till now. It is a global bull run. Look at how global biotechnology stocks are moving," says Sandeep Tandon, MD & CEO, Quant Broking Pvt Ltd.
"There are possibilities that in the next quarter, pharma stocks can consolidate. The significant outperformance, which we have seen, may not happen up to that extent, but pharma still remains overweight for us," he adds.
It is demand which is taking the prices to the next level, explain analysts. They are extraordinary bullish on US economy and anything related to the US market has performed very well and pharmaceutical also fits very well in that space.
Commenting on the valuations, Tandon is of the view that they are not that expensive because if we look at 20-30% growth, the momentum can continue from these levels also.
Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Securities, also shares the same view. "Most of the companies are already adequately priced in the pharma sector, but investors should look at adding positions on corrections," he says.
"I would like to buy pharma stocks in the portfolio only during the correction. So, would stay put on adding further at this point of time on pharma. Though I continue to hold many of the good quality stocks, but to buy afresh will wait for a correction in the market," explains Choksey.
Valuations are clearly very rich for pharma companies, but they are not overly expensive and investors with long-term horizon can look at buying into these stocks on declines.
"One has to question after the spectacular run up over the last one-and-a-half, two years whether this performance will continue in the next calendar year as well," says Harendra Kumar, Managing Director-Institutional Equities, Elara Capital.
"My guess is that given the spate of news flows, pharmaceutical stocks are likely to consolidate or see a correction at least for a quarter or six months from here on," he adds.
We have collated views and recommendations on various pharma sectors from different brokerage firms:
Aurobindo Pharma Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1308
The management has given a clear roadmap of its growth in formulation sales, which implies 15-20 per cent CAGR in FY15E-18E, Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report.
With more than 10 per cent CAGR in ARVs and EU sales (post Actavis), the company's roadmap for growth has limited challenging scenario. The stock trades at 19x and 16x of FY15E and FY16E with great potential to expand valuation multiple along with elevated fundamental parameters.
 
Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd: Target price set at Rs 3300
Dr Reddy's Laboratories Q2FY15 PAT at Rs 5.7bn on lower taxes and forex gains of Rs 243 mn. But sales at Rs 35.9 billion fell 3 per cent short of RCMLe (Religare Research) on weaker US sales (over 8%) with only one new launch in Q2.
Religare Institutional research rolled over to a Dec'15 target price of Rs 3,300 (from a Sep'15 TP of Rs 3,150). They also like Dr Reddy's for its improving return ratios, a strong B/S (0.1x D/E) and discounted valuations (vs. large peers). They maintain a 'BUY' rating on the stock.
A slower pace of new ANDA approvals hurt US sales (down 13% QoQ) as existing products faced pricing pressure (prices down 7%). Domestic growth (14%) continued to outstrip industry growth while Russia/RoW growth was hit by fx movements.
Glaxo SmithKline Pharmaceuticals: Angel Broking maintains 'neutral' rating
The pharma major announced its numbers for the quarter ended September 30, which are below our expectations on the OPM and net profit front. On the other hand, the revenue for the quarter came in in line with our expectations.
Glaxo posted a revenue of Rs 655 crore, up 2.8 per cent YoY. The EBITDA margin came in at 16.7 per cent, dipping by 116bp YoY. Thus, the PAT came in at Rs 98.2 crore, a dip of 3.4 per cent YoY. The brokerage firm maintains their Neutral rating on the stock.
Ipca Laboratories Ltd: Downgraded to 'underperform'
Credit Suisse has downgraded the stock to 'Underperform' from 'Neutral' and lowered its target price. According to the brokerage, adverse FDA action is likely at the company's Ratlam API and Indore SEZ plant. The 483 observations are critical and may delay the US sales recovery, it said.
Credit Suisse is of the view that there are 6 observations on Indore SEZ in Form 483, out of which 2 are critical observations.
The brokerage has lowered its target price to Rs 600 from Rs 740 post critical 483 observations
Lupin Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1515
Lupin's Q2 PAT at Rs 630 crore came on a lower tax rate (23% vs. 30% est.) and forex gains of Rs 17 crore. But sales at Rs 3110 crore disappointed as key US launches faced competitive headwinds, pushing down US sales QoQ.
Religare Institutional Reserach expects a pick-up in US launches/stable EBITDA margins (26-28%) to drive a 21 per cent EPS CAGR over FY14-FY17E. They have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a Dec'15 target price of Rs 1,515 (Sep'15 TP of Rs 1,365 earlier).

Jaitley defends new ministers  Cong and AAP point fingersJaitley defends new ministers, calls Congress' charge 'baseless'
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 10, 2014
First Published: 17:54 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 20:52 IST(10/11/2014)
As the Modi government came under intense Opposition fire for induction of allegedly “tainted” ministers, finance minister Arun Jaitley the strong counter-attack, refuted all allegations and insisted that "the entire charge of Congress is baseless".
 
Congress communication department chairman Ajay Maken had cited the records of 23 ministers and particularly targeted TDP nominee YS Chowdary and BJP’s Ram Shankar Katheria. Both leaders were inducted as ministers of state last Sunday. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal questioned JP Nadda’s appointment as the new health minister, replacing Harshvardhan.
 
Upping the ante against the Congress, Jaitley said, "During the UPA government, the PM never had the last word in the Cabinet formation or its expansion. In the NDA, the last word is exclusively that of the PM.”
 
Jaitley even advised the Congress to "confine itself to quality of poor governance that they gave and compare it with the quality of governance the NDA government is giving rather than resorting to these baseless allegations".
        
Maken had sought Chowdary’s resignation as his company had allegedly defaulted on the repayment of loans worth Rs. 317.6 crore taken from the Central Bank of India. Katheria, the Congress said, has 23 criminal cases against him. The Congress also described inclusion of Giriraj Singh, MP from Nawada, as a “crisp slap to secularism.”
 
Dismissing allegations against Kathetia, Jaitley pointed out that Akhilesh Yadav government has slapped criminal cases against all BJP workers in the state. “These are cases arising out of political agitations. Not cases out of some crime or moral turpitude,” the minister added.
 
Defending Chowdary, the finance minister added that one of his many companies was making losses. “One account was in difficulty. The bank restructured it; he is paying back all the instalments (and) has a regular account today," Jaitley said.
 
The Aam Admi Party also questioned the PM’s move to replace Harshvardhan with JP Nadda in the health ministry. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “Nadda, the man who got Sanjeev Chaturvedi transferred from AIIMS, made health min? So, now modi ji will remove corruption in AIIMS thro Nadda?” Jaitley defended Nadda to say that every MP has a right to raise issues.
 
Earlier too, the Congress and the BJP had locked horns over tainted ministers. In 2004, the BJP-led Opposition didn’t even allow the introduction of ministers by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over pending charges and cases against ministers.

How Homeland captures Americas shrinking role in the worldMandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson in Homeland (Season 4, Episode 1). – Photo: Joe Alblas/SHOWTIME
This post discusses the November 9 episode of “Homeland,” “Redux.”
I was getting ready to do some serious damage to my laptop when Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) emerged onto my screen in the final moments of “Redux.” I saw him die last season, and if his death did not touch me the way it did Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes), his pursuer, lover, and mother of his child, my relief that he was no longer weighing down a once-promising show was not inconsiderable, as pop culture-related emotions go.
But once it was firmly established that Carrie was, in fact, in the arms of Aasar Khan (Raza Jaffrey)–though if this dishy ISI agent does not know who Brody is, Pakistan may be a less formidable adversary this season suggests–rather than her truly deceased paramour, I could enjoy “Redux” again.
And while the title seems to refer to Carrie’s hallucination, there is another, more profound way to interpret it. In Saul Berenson’s (Mandy Patinkin) captivity at the hands of Hassiam Haqqani (Numan Acar), we have a powerful parallel with Brody’s return to America three seasons ago. This striking reversal of roles is a powerful way for “Homeland” to examine America’s diminishment in the years since the death of Osama bin Laden.
Haqqani is Brody’s opposite in almost every way, and their homecomings are in stark contrast to each other. Haqqani is himself a charismatic leader as opposed to a ruin repurposed for another leader’s aims. When he comes back to his community and his family after years away, Haqqani is publicly celebrated and able to enjoy his welcome, unlike Brody, who longed to have returned for real, but  had instead committed himself to the destruction of his old homeland.
Haqqani’s younger children are delighted to see him, rushing into his arms. And his diffident older child, Marwand, is still willing to listen to his father despite his displeasure at Saul’s presence at his father’s side, apologizing when Haqqani chastises him for throwing a shoe at Saul, the only enemy available for the teenage boy to fight. If only Dana Brody (Morgan Saylor) had known such peace.
And Haqqani’s wife is delighted to see him, still faithful after his multi-year absence, rather than attached to a new man and a new idea of her life, as Jessica Brody (Morena Baccarin) had become. When they go to bed after years apart, the Haqqanis  genuinely make love, in a scene that is in striking contrast to the Brodys’ desperate grappling together in their bed, and Brody’s pained exertions alone on their bedroom floor.
Saul is in a much more vulnerable position than Carrie, his mentor and surrogate daughter. Rather than stalking his prey, Saul is fighting for his own survival. His protestations that “I’m of not intelligence value whatsoever” miss the point. “Here, now, riding in this car, feeling the sun on my face, I can’t remember the last time I was able to travel so freely in the light of day,” Haqqani reminds him, neglecting to add that keeping Saul prisoner and living openly also lets him mock the American government.
Unlike Brody, who was fragile and uncertain, vulnerable to his renewed connection with his children and Carrie’s insights into his soul, Haqqani is confident, his family’s goals and his community’s aligned with his own. “You have taught an entire generation to live with one foot in the afterlife,” Saul tells Haqqani, angry, after his boilerplate fails to convince his captor at dinner with Haqqani’s household. “If Christianity were to be measured by the misery it has caused mankind, who would ever be a Christian?” Haqqani volleys back at him, confident as a number one seed on a freshly-mowed grass court. “I’m a Jew,” Saul tells him, giving up the argument.
The first three seasons of “Homeland” were all about the tremendous effort it took to deal with one wavering man on soil that once might have been his home, but to which he had become a stranger. But now that the CIA is in Pakistan, the game is a very different and much more challenging one, even before the station chief unknowingly went off her medication.
“An errant strike on a wedding party, the murder of Sandy Bachman, and now this? Dysfunction does not begin to describe the magnitude of the problem here,” CIA Director Andrew Lockhart (Tracy Letts). No, it does not. And even if “Homeland” continues to be distracted from doing its best work by the show’s ongoing commitment to Carrie Mathison’s drama, it has still found a powerful way to communicate America’s strategic weaknesses in Pakistan and far beyond.

New Delhi, November 10:  
After Sunday’s induction of 21 new Ministers, 92 per cent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet now consists of crorepatis, says an analysis by the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) and National Election Watch, non-profit election watchdogs.
Of the 64 affidavits analysed, 59 Ministers were crorepatis, with average assets of the newly elected Ministers at Rs 18.48 crore, ADR said in a release. The details of Suresh Prabhu and Birendra Singh were not analysed as they are not members of either House.

Steel usage growth slows to 0.5% in April-OctSteel usage growth slows to 0.5% in April-Oct

New Delhi, November 10:  
Growth in India’s steel consumption slowed down to 0.5 per cent for the April – October 2014 period to 43.112 million tonnes, indicating a tough economic environment, as per the latest data from the Joint Plant Committee under the Ministry of Steel.
In the same period last year the country had consumed 42.9 million tonnes.
The slow down in growth for the April – October period was also due to lower demand in October. During the month, India consumed 6.53 million tonnes of steel, a drop of 1.3 per cent over the same month last year.
“The slow/negative growth numbers appear to reflect the lingering effect of economic slowdown and are further depressed by the decline in production for sale in October 2014 over October 2013,” the statement from JPC said.
Domestic steel makers produced around 10.31 million tonnes of steel in October 2014, which was 10 per cent lower than the same month last year.
However, during the period of April – October 2014, steel production grew 2.3 per cent to 50.61 million tonnes as compared to the same period last year.

00:00  I am David Callaway editor in chief of USA today
00:03  coming here from USA today San Francisco bureau. We did a
00:07  fabulous panel Stamford university on Silicon Valley. And diversity hiring looking
00:13  at the issues talking about solutions with hiring managers from FaceBook
00:17  Google and reverend Jesse Jackson himself. Here are the highlights. We
00:22  cannot afford to exclude anyone because it's not like 80% of
00:25  the men right. We need to have as many diverse perspectives
00:29  as possible building these products and supporting and if we did
00:31  tonight it is a question of the Bible. I'm black coat
00:34  of brown you'd cover out of stance. As less options to
00:40  come silicone rather than their white count of thoughts start right
00:43  here. We've discussed this at men. This is this this whole
00:48  thing pact made it and it's not good for business it
00:52  does not meet their mercker and spend the but opportunity. Don't
00:57  wire when you look at the football game and separately as
00:59  Berkeley is shattered they have known and they Brent excited. Why
01:03  can accept the outcome. Lose or win. Because the trip it
01:08  was even. And the rules of Republican goal to clear the
01:13  represents fair. The schools are transparent. The company access to the
01:18  valley and its extension across America is not fair. And they
01:22  must be some commitment to study that the DNA of the
01:25  conference and figure out how you how come. Profit from inclusion.
01:30  As opposed to the price of doing business two and a
01:33  sense. We're confronting problems. 2000. But one of the most important
01:47  pieces of legislation ever passed in this country in my opinion.
01:52  And did enormous amounts of good in enormous. Swaptions. American life.
01:58  However. I'm in 2014. Many of the problems that we're confronting
02:03  don't fit well. Would that conventional model. Into a lot of
02:07  events iGoogle. More of an account in the past year. Geared
02:12  towards but he knows I have not seen once in a
02:15  recruiter come to the events I've phase out its next. Next
02:19  four miles away from these are proud which has been. Predominantly
02:23  Latino and black. High school graduate I want that go on
02:27  to college degree get caught got 94% going to get up
02:31  for your. University degrees and there there are hundreds internships. They're
02:37  and a three raise your purchase one is we have to
02:39  look at what we do honor to be short too so.
02:42  Where are you going right are you looking on New York
02:44  spotlight only in expecting to see all of the different hot

02:52  we just got to get something going to be able to
02:54  only took only tennis it's about being born out products taken
02:57  risks I removed from the break things that we see a
02:59  product. Are we being schooled enough in terms of where we
03:04  look at who we look for. Another aspect of it is
03:06  to the extent that these students are in places. Like historically
03:11  black colleges and universities. We ask ourselves how we recruit from
03:16  there and what we have found. Is that some. The curriculum
03:20  at their schools may not match to the MIT or Carnegie
03:24  Mellon it's just a step a reality. And show instead of
03:27  not drawing talent from those schools we need you help those
03:31  colleges and universities. Bring more rigor and ten more competitiveness to
03:36  the computer science programs for example so that's why we decided
03:40  let's just. Essentially dropping hints on our own Googlers. You help.
03:45  Look at the curriculum. Really provide some console consultation into academics
03:51  there. To pass so they can understand what types of skills
03:53  need to have people be ready to dropping in and clerks
03:57  at Google. Cadillac anyway did you cat is going to recruit

USA TODAY panel on diversity in Silicon Valley @Stanford Law School, featuring Rev. Jesse Jackson and reps from Google and Facebook.
SAN FRANCISCO — For years, technology companies did worse than simply shrug off the issue of diversity in their workforce.
Some sued to keep that information private from inquiring media outlets and social activists, arguing that divulging such data compromised their competitive advantage.
Given that decades-long mind-set, the USA TODAY/Stanford Diversity in Tech summit meeting Thursday night with Jesse Jackson and executives from Google and Facebook was nothing less than a breakthrough on an issue that has vexed the nation since slavery was abolished: minority access to employment and capital.
"Bringing people together to talk about these issues is historic,"  said Carol Lynn McKibben, a Stanford lecturer who is writing a biography of Jackson. "These things are usually discussed behind closed doors. This was a really important moment to talk about these things in a public forum."
Nation's capital has lessons for tech industry diversity
McKibben said she was impressed that the audience included "Stanford students who will be applying for jobs with these companies, (as well as) people who have themselves experienced discrimination or who as minorities have worked in these white-majority companies. I hope it is not the end but the beginning of the discussion."
Some of the biggest players in Silicon Valley readily acknowledged the diversity gap in the nearly two-hour panel, punctuating a months-long push by the Rev. Jackson to bolster low single-digit representation of blacks and Hispanics at tech companies.
Jackson and his Rainbow/PUSH coalition have been raising awareness of the divide in Silicon Valley, where the percentage of employees who are black or Hispanic are in the single digits compared with 12% and 16% of the U.S. workforce, respectively.
Lack of diversity could undercut Silicon Valley
For decades, the issue has been a non-starter in the predominantly white-male tech industry that either overlooked or ignored it.
But as the composition of their customers becomes more diverse, those companies have no choice but to hire people who reflect their customer base and to build more inclusive workplaces.
"We don't have a choice at Facebook. It's not like we are creating something for use in a local market. It is a truly global market. More than 80% of Facebook users do not live in  North America. We can't afford to exclude anyone," said Maxine Williams, Facebook's global head of diversity. "It is a question of survival."
Tristan Walker, an African-American entrepreneur, has a Palo Alto start-up — Walker & Co. — which he has deliberately staffed with almost exclusively women and minorities.
He says tech companies are waking up to the growing consumer power of blacks and Hispanics in this country and to the realities of operating in a global marketplace. Studies show that companies with gender and ethnic diversity are more creative and more profitable, he points out.
"As long as they are talking about it but not acting on it, I have a comparative advantage," Walker said.
Jackson urged representatives from Facebook and Google to increase their minority outreach programs and provide measurable results. Those executives in turn responded that they were keen to have their staffs better reflect the national demographic, but that short-term solutions weren't likely.
INEQUITY IN SILICON VALLEY: All stories, columns in USA TODAY's series
Overt bigotry doesn't play a major role in this issue, which in fact makes it a more difficult problem to root out, said panelist Richard Thompson Ford, Stanford law professor and author of The Race Card.
"Bias (in tech) is more readily concealed," he said. "Most of the problems will be resolved by trying to engage hiring managers to see diversity as a positive goal that they are on board with. In many ways, that's a harder problem to solve than unrepentant bigots."
Ford said universities need to pay more attention to not only who they're recruiting for engineering degrees but also the environment in which they are sending those minority recruits.
"Will you find racists in the computer science department? No, but you may find people with preconceived ideas of who will be good or not. There's a culture that exists in those departments, one of who helps who. And maybe you then go, I could do something else, I've got options," he said.
DIVERSITY ROAD MAP
So what exactly is the road map for diversifying Silicon Valley's largely white male profile?
Education is a major building component, beginning with science and technology courses in elementary school that widen the pool, the panel agreed.
Nancy Lee, Google's director of diversity and inclusion, said the search-engine giant will cast a wider net by recruiting from non-elite schools and placing a Googler in Residence at traditionally black colleges with a mission to bring computer-science programs up to Google's hiring standards.
Google's diversity chief started her crusade young
"We may not have seen tech's best days because we haven't seen all its best players," Jackson said, drawing an analogy to the breaking of the color barrier in Major League Baseball in 1947, which presaged a golden era of breathtaking talent in the sport.
Yet some of the approximately 200 people in attendance want more than talk. They want results.
"It's good to have conversations. But this topic has been talked to death, and nothing gets done," said Anthony Kinslow II, 24, a graduate student in Stanford's civil engineering program. "When I was an undergrad (at North Carolina A&T State University, the historically black college that Jackson attended), no tech recruiters visited. None."
"Diversity goes hand-in-hand with innovation and ideas," Kinslow said, pointing out that just 1% of Stanford's graduate school of engineering students are black. "Wouldn't it make more sense for tech companies to be more diverse?"
The panel was "clearly a first step" in tackling a longtime problem, says Anita Gardyne, CEO of SafetySitters, a start-up that offers in-house care and babysitting services through a mobile app and website. Gardyne, who is black, said Jackson's persistence has forced tech companies to disclose their hiring numbers and address the problem.
"I just want an opportunity to compete," said Gardyne, 52, who says it is daunting to pitch her company to prospective investors.
"Do I see something changing? Yes, I do," Gardyne said. "Rev. Jackson has lifted the discussion. These are the first steps in a long journey."

Woman spontaneously revives after 45 minutes without a pulseFor 45 minutes, 40-year old Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro had no pulse. Now she is alive and healthy with no brain damage. (Photodisc)
They are calling it "a miracle."
Doctors at Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida have no way to explain how 40-year-old Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro survived after spending 45 minutes without a pulse and enduring three hours of attempts to bring her back from near-death on Sept. 23.
Graupera-Cassimiro, now a mother of two, had just come out of a cesarean section procedure to deliver her new daughter. Then suddenly, she went from chattering with her family to struggling for her life, according to the Sun Sentinel. 
She was suffering from a rare complication called an amniotic fluid embolism, in which the fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb enters the mother's blood stream. The condition can cause life-threatening blood clots. 
As Graupera-Cassimiro slipped into unconsciousness, doctors and nurses rushed back to her room in a desperate effort to save her life.
After more than two hours later, her heart stopped.
Doctors and nurses began chest compression that would continue for 45 minutes. They took turns to avoid exhaustion and used electric shock paddles. But nothing worked.
Finally, they decided to call her family into the room to say their goodbyes.
"Once we say that's it, that's it," said anesthesiologist Dr. Anthony Salvadore, according to the Sun Sentinel.
Her family left the room to pray. And doctors were on the verge of declaring her dead when suddenly there was a blip her heart monitor. That was followed by another and another.
Nurse Claire Hansen came out of the operating room with a shocking message, the Sun Sentinel reported.
"Keep praying," she told Graupera-Cassimiro's assembled family, "because her heart just started."
"She essentially spontaneously resuscitated when we were about to call the time of death," said Thomas Chakurda, the hospital spokesman told the Associated Press. 
A day later, Graupera-Cassimiro was taken off of life support. And today she is "the picture of health," Chakurda said.
On Tuesday, she and her newborn baby returned to the hospital to thank nurses and doctors for their life-saving efforts.
"Had you guys maybe stopped before the 45 minutes of compressions -- I mean, I don't know. All I know is that I'm grateful to be here," Graupera-Cassimiro she told them, according to the Sun Sentinel. "I don't know why I was given this opportunity, but I'm very grateful for it."
Childbirth complications like Graupera-Cassimiro's are rare -- it is estimated that between 1 and 12 cases of amniotic embolism occur with every 100,000 births, according to the Mayo Clinic. Scientists don't fully understand why complications occur for some mothers but not for others, but pregnancy at an older age, c-sections, and medically induced labor may increase the risk to some women.
But not only did Graupera-Cassimiro survive, but she suffered no brain damage or physical injuries from efforts to revive her.
"There's very few things in medicine that I've seen, working in the trauma center myself and doing all the things that I do, that really were either unexplainable or miraculous," said the president of the hospital's medical staff, Dr. Anthony Dardano, according to the Sun Sentinel. "And when I heard this story, that was the first thing that came to my mind."

Consult fisherfolk before implementing Meenakumari report: NFFConsult fisherfolk before implementing Meenakumari report: NFF
Tomojit Basu

New Delhi, Nov. 10:  
On the heels of Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh’s calls for a ‘Blue Revolution’ and a transformation of the fisheries sector, members of the National Fishworkers Forum (NFF) drafted a note to protect the rights of fishing communities as a reaction to the Meenakumari Report.
“We have gone through the report submitted by the committee headed by Dr. B. Meenakumari… and have serious reservation about various aspects of the report such as earmarking “200 mtr. To 500 mtr. Depth buffer zone (where Indian fishermen will be prevented from fishing), encouraging foreign staff in Indian vessels and allowing foreign fishing vessels in our waters,” said an NFF statement on Monday.
The seven-member Meenakumari Committee had submitted its report in August and its recommendations included deploying 1,178 deep-sea vessels including existing ones, and an additional 270 vessels comprising 240 tuna long-liners, 15 squid jiggers and 15 purseiner boats in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This was in response to an observation that waters beyond the depth of 500 m were not exploited optimally.
Comprehensive regulations were suggested for implementation of indigenous fishing in the EEZ, as also allowing foreigners to man operations where Indian hands were not qualified.
“We demand that wider consultations with the fisher people and their organisations should be held in all the 10 coastal States and Union territories…before any decision is made on the implementation,” NFF said.
Indian fishermen in Lanka
The forum also took up the issue of five Indian fisherman arrested in 2011 being awarded capital punishment in Sri Lanka. They had set out from Rameswaram and were apprehended by the Lankan Navy and charged with narcotics possession.
Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy, however, said that arrangements had been made to transfer the convicted fishermen to an Indian prison. “While we are appreciative of this step, we still hold as our demand that they should be released unconditionally,” read the NFF statement quoting Swamy.
The NFF also demanded that the Lankan authorities release 82 boats and 24 other Indian fishermen who are interned there. They criticised the swindling of 22 Tamil fishermen by Saudi Arabia-based contractors that had resulted in them being illegally incarcerated in prison there for a year along with a fine of 7,000 Riyal (Rs 1.15 lakh), as also in Iran, where five Indian fishermen were imprisoned this September and had to pay Rs 5.5 lakh fine.

The fund manager will assist the government in sale of residual stakes in ITC, L&T and Axis Bank.
The Government of India holds these shares - 11.27 per cent in ITC, 8.18 per cent in L&T and 11.66 per cent in Axis Bank - through Specified Undertaking of UTI (SUUTI).
As many as seven asset management companies (AMCs) -- Reliance Mutual Fund, Birla Sun Life MF, Kotak Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund, UTI Mutual Fund and Sundaram Mutual fund in consortium with Edelweiss Mutual Fund had participated in this bidding process.
According to sources, ICICI Prudential AMC emerged as the lowest bidder after the financial bids were opened today. Earlier during the technical bidding round, SBI MF had come on the top.
The selected fund house, which would be finalised after deliberations by SUUTI's board and other officials, will act as the manager for the new ETF, which is expected to hit the market in the last quarter of the current financial year (2014-15).
ICICI Securities is advising the government for selection of a fund house for managing an ETF for monetising these SUUTI shares.
The government had sold 9 per cent stake in Axis Bank held through SUUTI in March this year through the bulk deal on the stock exchanges. Formed in 2003, SUUTI is an offshoot of the erstwhile UTI (Unit Trust of India).
The proposed ETF will serve as an additional mechanism for the government to monetise its shareholdings in SUUTI and other selected CPSEs that eventually form part of the ETF basket.
As per the bid documents, the ETF could be launched as a New Fund Offer (NFO) followed by further tranches and/or a tap structure, and SUUTI and government may provide appropriate discount for different investors, in the form of a suitable mix of upfront and back-end loyalty discount.
The proposed ETF will be launched as a close-ended structure.
In March, the government had successfully launched the ETF comprising shares of 10 PSUs. The ETF has registered handsome gains since its launch.
The government proposes to raise Rs 15,000 crore in the current fiscal through sale of residual stakes in private companies. It plans to raise Rs 43,425 crore through stake sale in PSUs.

Performance-chasing may spur year-end rallyPerformance-chasing could spur year-end rally

It’s the time of year when money managers whose funds are lagging the overall market or specific index or style benchmarks they are measured against have to start playing catch-up. And with a large swath of funds lagging behind this year, that means a lot of fund managers could chase the market and buy stocks.
And that so-called performance-chasing could provide yet another building block for a market already trading at record highs on the strength of a strong seasonal tailwind, robust corporate earnings, an improving economy and continued support and stimulus from central banks around the globe.
Only 14% of fund managers posted returns that topped the performance of the S&P 500 index this year through the end of October, according to an analysis done by Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The average fund return was 8.6%, which trailed the market benchmark by almost 2.5 percentage points. Fewer than 6% of growth fund managers topped the S&P 500, BofA data show.

Similarly, fewer than 18% of fund managers topped the large-cap Russell 1000 stock index — putting the funds’ miss rate at its worst level in 10 years.
While Subramanian says she’s not a big believer in the thesis that the market gets a fourth-quarter boost from funds “buying risk in an attempt to catch up,” many Wall Street pros say it can have a bullish effect on the market near year’s end.

Phishing successful 45 per cent of the time: studyEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Certain websites included in phishing emails successfully lure users up to 45 per cent of the time, according to a new Google study.
Researchers at Google and the University of California, San Diego found that emails that try to trick users into handing over their information work way better than believed.
Once the user reaches bogus pages, which tend to imitate legitimate sites, 14 per cent of people unwittingly submit their information to hackers, ‘Huffington Post’ reported.
The study found that the percentage of people who get tricked was “much higher” than they expected.
Researchers looked at 100 phishing emails picked out of a random sample self-reported by Gmail users.
They also reviewed a random sample of 100 phishing websites caught by Google’s Safe Browsing system to further understand how the scams work.
Investigators were then able to look back and see how people interacted with the emails and websites.
The study found even on the worst-performing phishing websites, 3 per cent of users still submitted their data. On the most effective phishing sites, as many as 45 per cent did.
Researchers said 20 per cent of hackers access compromised accounts within 30 minutes of getting their credentials.
This is big business for scammers, as one attacker can be responsible for millions of phishing emails, Google noted.

Black money will be key issue at G-20: ModiComments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said highlighting the importance of international cooperation against black money would be a “key issue” for him at the forthcoming G-20 Summit in Brisbane.

In his longest foreign tour after becoming PM, Modi will leave for Myanmar on Tuesday to take part in the India-ASEAN Summit and East Asia Summit on November 12-13 followed by the G-20 meet in Brisbane on November 15-16 and a bilateral visit to Fiji Islands on November 19.
Modi will meet more than 40 leaders from countries representing Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and the Pacific Region during his 10-day tour.
India will attempt to build consensus on a global framework for automatic sharing of information to check tax evasion during the G-20 Summit, at a time the government has stepped up efforts to bring back money stashed illegally abroad. Modi’s visit will be the bilateral visit to Australia by an Indian PM in 28 years.
“The G-20 Summit is a key forum for countries to coordinate their activities and pursue collective action to support global economic growth, stable financial markets and global trading regimes,” Modi said on the eve of his foreign tour.
He said he would also discuss how the creation of next generation infrastructure could be accelerated, including digital infrastructure.
He said a closer strategic partnership with Australia would support India’s economic goals, promote its security interests, including maritime security, and reinforce efforts to foster peace and stability in the extended continental and maritime neighbourhood.
On the Myanmar tour, Modi said ASEAN was at the core of India’s Act East Policy and the dream of an Asian century. “I am looking forward to discussing with ASEAN leaders how to take our relationship to a new level,” the PM said.
At the East Asia Summit, the PM will discuss with other leaders ways to strengthen regional institutions, international norms and regional cooperation in pursuit of peace and stability.
Modi will be the first Indian PM to visit Fiji in 33 years. “We owe them (Fiji) a debt of gratitude for hosting our scientists on the island in support of our Mars Mission.” He will meet leaders and representatives of 12 Pacific Island nations during the visit.

Masked gang vandalise Nitta Gelatin office in KeralaPolice officials inspecting the office of Nitta Gelatin India Limited (NGIL), which was attacked in a suspected Maoist attack in Kochi on Monday.(Source: PTI)
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: November 11, 2014 3:10 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 3:11 am
The corporate office of Nitta Gelatin India Limited (NGIL) in Kochi, a prominent Indo-Japanese industrial venture, was attacked by an unidentified group on Monday.
NGIL’s unit in Thrissur district, which manufactures ossein, has been facing resistance over polluting a nearby river. A nine-member gang, wearing masks, stormed into the corporate office after threatening the security staff. Using iron rods, they demolished the computers and window panes.
Kochi city police commissioner K G James said a special team is probing into the attack. “We have recovered a letter, which has reference to Maoists. The letter has called for armed struggle and indicates that Maoists have taken claim for the attack. But, whether Maoists were actually involved in the attack could be ascertained only after the probe, said the commissioner.
He said some ultra elements along with local people near the NGIL factory were involved in the agitation. Hence, it has to be looked whether the local agitators were behind the attack and used the letter to divert the probe.
NGIL is a leading manufacturer of gelatin, ossein, di-calcium phosphate, collagen peptide and related products which have wide applications in pharmaceuticals. The NGIL’s unit in Thrissur was attacked last year in connection with the agitation against polluting river Chalakkudy.

GSPC reduces PNG prices for Gujarats industrial customers by Rs 2 per scmPrint
By: Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 10, 2014 8:36 pm
GSPC Gas Company Ltd, a subsidiary of the state-run Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC), has decided to cut the prices of piped natural gas (PNG) for industries in the state by Rs 2 per standard cubic meter (SCM) from November 16 onwards.
The prices will be reduced to Rs 39.65 from the earlier Rs 41.65 per SCM (exclusive of taxes). “This reduction is being brought about after taking into consideration the prevailing prices of natural gas in the international market,” stated a release from the company.
GSPC Gas supplies 3.8-4 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of PNG to over 1900 industrial customers in clusters of Vapi, Umargaon, Sarigam, Bilimora, Gundlav, Morai, Navsari, Hazira, Valsad, Dahej, Gandhinagar, Karjan, Rajkot, Surendranagar-Wadhwan, Halol, Morbi, Nadiad, Thangadh, Palej, Khambhat and Petlad.
However, the company had increased the PNG prices for it’s domestic customers to Rs 24.83 per Standard Cubic Meter or SCM (without taxes) from Rs 23.50 on November 1. “We get the gas for our PNG (domestic) and CNG consumers form the Government of India. The prices of this segment was raised after the government raised the prices,” said a senior official from the company.
“Meanwhile, the natural gas that we get for the industrial customers is from the international market, which includes both spot and long-term procurements,” the official added.

45-year-old woman stripped  paraded on donkey in tribal village on charges of murderPrint
By: Express News Service | Jaipur | Posted: November 11, 2014 3:00 am | Updated: November 11, 2014 9:27 am
A 45-year-old woman was forcibly tonsured, stripped and paraded on a donkey across a tribal village in Rajsamand district on Saturday. Thirty villagers involved in the act have been arrested out of them 26 have been sent to judicial custody and the rest to police custody.
On November 2, one Vardi Singh from Thuravad village in Rajsamand district died under mysterious circumstances. His family cremated him soon after without a post-mortem but three days later a meeting of the village elders cast suspicions on the 45-year-old woman, who is a relative of the deceased. The villagers also filed a police complaint against the woman but did not wait for justice to be delivered. Instead they dragged the woman out of her house, blackened her face with charcoal, tonsured her head, stripped and paraded her on a donkey across the village.
The victim’s husband reported the matter to the police who swung into action and arrested 30 villagers including nine relatives of the victim. “The incident is shocking and we have not let anyone go scot free. All 30 villagers including a woman who were found guilty of being involved in the act have been sent to either judicial or police custody,” Sweta Dhankar, superintendent of police, Rajsamand told the Indian Express. “The victim was initially sent to a shelter home and counselled. She was in trauma and not in a state to narrate the incident. However after counselling her we have been able to record her statement. She is now at her parents’ place and we have provided her full security.”
“The victim was initially sent to a shelter home and counselled. She was in trauma and not in a state to narrate the incident. However after counselling her we have been able to record her statement. She is now at her parents’ place and we have provided her full security.”
Dhankar said that the cause of Vardi Singh’s death could not be ascertained as he was cremated without a post mortem. However circumstantial evidence points to a suicidal death. “The villagers cannot take the law in their hands like this. If they had any suspicion against the victim they should have approached the police for a fair investigation and not passed their own judgment. The matter is still being probed,” Dhankar said.
Tension continued to prevail in the village and heavy police force was deployed to avoid any untoward incident.

New Delhi, Nov 10:  
Realty firm Omaxe today reported 24 per cent decline in its consolidated net profit at Rs 13.88 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014—15.
It had posted net profit of Rs 18.15 crore in the July— September period of the last fiscal.
The Q2 income from operations, however, rose by 4 per cent to Rs 378.92 crore, from Rs 365.45 crore in the second quarter of 2013—14.
Omaxe is currently undertaking 42 real estate projects — 14 group housing, 18 townships and 10 commercial.
“Due to the General Elections, the initial months of the first half of the fiscal was marked by postponement of investment and purchase cycle,” Omaxe CMD Rohtas Goel said in a statement.
“However, with the emergence of a stable government at the centre and a slew of measures like REIT, Smart Cities, affordable housing norms etc, there was a renewed spurt in enquiries,” he added.

The Most Opinionated States in the Country Might Surprise You [Infographic]reddit
I had the opportunity to speak with Zac Carman of ConsumerAffairs about the site's forthcoming study, set to be published this month on their blog. The consumer advocacy group and online review platform examined which states are most likely to review or complain about businesses and brands. A preview of their new infographic highlights which states are the most vocal using a heat map.
Is your state in the red?
The Complain-Tastic Top 5, with a Few Choice Examples
5th Place: New Jersey
New Jersey reviewers have no interest in engaging other readers: they go right for the throat, throwing shade and calling out brands in front of the entire Internet.
This Paramus, NJ mom knows that the stakes are high.
We all want answers, New Jersey. We all want answers.
4th and 3rd: Nevada and Delaware
Nevada reviewers keep it short and (not at all) sweet.
Meanwhile, Delaware reviewers ask us to ponder some of life's biggest questions.
Tied For 1st: Florida and Washington D.C.
With colorful descriptors, thorough coverage, and aggressive capitalizations, this Florida reviewer allows to really feel his frustration and disgust.
Think he should just slow his roll and wait for the cleaning catastrophe to come to a close? Think again -- he's already tried it.
But Where's New York?
In a shocking twist, New York, widely considered the rudest state in America, only made it to number 12 on the complainer countdown. When asked for comment on this surprising twist, New Yorkers responded, "We don't care, and we'd like you to get lost now."
New York is more than a city. It's a birthright. It's an attitude. It's a language of it's own.
— Little Bastard Boy (@Al_Patron) November 2, 2014
Can Reviews Make or Break Businesses?
I asked Carman about his company's research process, and whether or not the results were a surprise. "Each month, about 100,000 consumers come to our website to write complaints and reviews. One day we got the idea to see how these conversations varied from state to state," he explains. "We analyzed the most recent 238,239 reviews we'd received from consumers in the U.S."
"Initially, I was surprised to see states that I'd think would be 'complainers' lower on the list, like New York," Carman recalls. "But as I reflected on the demographic composition of the U.S., the data began to make sense."
Carman claims negative or positive reviews can seriously impact the prospects for businesses. "Brands spend billions of dollars researching the hearts and minds of consumers, and billions more trying to persuade them into a specific buying behavior using sophisticated marketing," he says. "An Econsultancy study confirmed that consumers trust the opinions (read: review) of other consumers more than marketing and even more than an expert endorsement."
A new Harvard Business Review study concurs : a one-star rating increase can help restaurants to boost revenue by between five and nine percent. And Carman believes negative reviews and positive mentions can massively influence brand perception. "Negative reviews, especially when not addressed, can directly impact the bottom line," he says. "ShareThis CEO Kurt Abrahamson told me that recommendations have more of an impact than brand name or price. Highly positive reviews online can generate almost a 10 percent increase in purchase intent, and negative reviews can also have a correspondingly negative impact, reducing purchase intent by 11 percent."
The forthcoming ConsumerAffairs study reveals the true power of the consumer voice in the modern marketplace. To all you New Jerseyans, Nevadians, Washingtonians, and Floridians: keep whining -- it's working!

Now that Bangalore is BengaluruNow that Bangalore is Bengaluru
NARENDAR PANI

Welcome aboard: A city for all - GP SAMPATH KUMAR
It should be followed by a more inclusive, less elitist approach to urban policy than has been the case so far
November 9, 2014:  
When Bangalore was finally officially renamed Bengaluru on the anniversary of the formation of Karnataka on November 1, it was not without a tinge of controversy. One of the city’s leading corporate icons tweeted negatively about the move, only to be swamped by often abusive responses in the social media.
We need to ask what, if any, are the costs of abandoning the name Bangalore and, conversely, what, if any, are the costs of not doing so?
The reactions of the globalised corporate icons are presumably based on the fact that the name Bangalore had developed some brand equity. Bangalore was widely recognised in the global discourse on information technology.
Indeed, the term ‘Bangalored’ was coined to refer to those in the advanced countries who found their jobs being shifted to cities in the developing world. This may well have helped Bangalore in attracting investments from those seeking to locate their operations outside the developed world. The change to Bengaluru may not completely remove this advantage, but it could be a dampener.
Win some, lose some
The loss generated by the shift to Bengaluru must however be weighed against the costs of retaining the name Bangalore. The latter costs can only be understood if we take a closer look at the nature of the demand for the change in name. The demand for this change is closely linked to the assertiveness of the local Kannada identity.
As the city has grown it has incorporated new villages that are not entirely comfortable with the English-speaking elite. Just as Bangalore had brand equity for the English-speaking elite and those who aspired to enter that group, Bengaluru had brand equity for those in the absorbed villages and the migrant workers who resided in them.
In the initial years of the city’s IT revolution, the differences between Bangalore and Bengaluru were resolved primarily by clearly demarcating boundaries where the two would operate. Bangalore dominated the realm of urban policymaking while Bengaluru dominated the realm of politics and the patronage.
The influence of those who associated with the idea of Bangalore on policymaking was relatively quiet with little public attention being paid to the setting up of Electronic City and the choice of those who were allotted land in it. In contrast, the demands of those who associated with the idea of Bengaluru, including welfare schemes, were the subject of high decibel political campaigns.
This neat demarcation was broken at the turn of the millennium when the then chief minister, SM Krishna, provided a prominent public role for corporate icons in the planning for the city with the setting up of the Bangalore Agenda Task Force (BATF).
As BATF worked through the power of the chief minister, it was in the enviable position of being able to influence policy without having to take responsibility for its failures.
The ability of corporate icons to influence elite public discourse further immunised them from any public criticism. Street corners in Bengaluru today are strewn with garbage, leading outsiders to ask the simple question: Why are there no garbage bins? Yet few, if any, in Bengaluru speak of the garbage strategy of the BATF that led to the removal of these bins.
Being heard
Those associated with the idea of Bangalore have, if anything, become even more vocal in recent years. Two corporate icons of the city upbraided Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for his choice of IT minister, who was apparently not westernised enough for their liking. One of them went on to take the lead in setting up a political action committee that plays a prominent role in the political discourse of the city’s elite. Their forays into the political space have not been entirely unchallenged.
When they have got carried away by their own propaganda and entered the actual electoral space, the results have been far from rewarding.
The way out of this deeply divisive stage in the history of the city, would be for those associated with the idea of Bengaluru to find space in the public discourse on urban policy. The promotion of their interests would require a much more cost-effective strategy for the city.
Rather than building unaffordable projects based on foreign models, their interests would be better served by cost-effective infrastructure. A greater sensitivity to costs would also revive the city’s fortunes in attracting global investment as well as migrant labour.
Changing the name is certainly a step towards creating a more inclusive and sustainable Bengaluru.

Telling a survivors storyTelling a survivor’s story
Bijoy Bharathan

Meet Thomas Keneally, the man behind Schindler’s Ark, the book behind the film, Schindler’s List
Whoever Saves One Life, Saves the World Entire — says the Talmud, the book of Jewish Law. It’s a simple line that encapsulates the emotions of the Jews who were rescued from imminent extermination at the hands of the Nazis, by one man — Oskar Schindler. The German industrialist and member of the Nazi Party saved the lives of 1,200 Jews, having employed them in his weapons and enamelware factories in occupied Poland and the Czech Republic during the Holocaust. His story inspired Australian author Thomas Keneally’s Booker Prize-winning 1982 novel Schindler’s Ark (‘Schindler’s List’ in the US). Keneally visited Goa last month for the International Writers & Readers Festival 2014. In an exclusive to BusinessLine, the writer, whose book served as the basis for Steven Spielberg’s moving holocaust drama Schindler’s List (1993), spoke about the legacy of the acclaimed historical novel and the role of writers in shaping the world as it is today.
While writing Schindler’s Ark, were you overwhelmed, having to relive the experiences of the survivors of such a painful history?
Yes, both in the writing process and after the book was published, there was a certain depression from the experience. You think you can get in easily and tell the story, and get out. That’s what writers and journalists always want to do.
They don’t want to be touched by the story — they just simply want to write it. In a process as long as a novel and its associated research, it is inevitable that there will be phases of personal torment — nothing like what the people went through originally, but phases of it.
The thing is, I am not even Jewish. I was playing with other peoples’ stories. So I deserve to bear some of the weight of that. And you do bear some of it.
Tell us about Poldek Pfefferberg (the Holocaust survivor and one of Schindler’s Jews) who inspired you to write the book.
Poldek aka Leopold was a very funny man and very bossy. I remember once, while researching the book, the two of us were in Poland. Out there, you’re only allowed to exchange the local currency (zlotys) at the money exchange desk in the hotels. But if you traded it on the streets, you could get many more zlotys than the official rate. I always wanted to change the money legally, but Poldek wanted to do so on the streets and he did. When we were ready to leave Poland, we realised we were in trouble as we had too many zlotys.
However, at the airport, Poldek started offering the security officials parts in ‘the movie’ (based on the book which wasn’t even written at that stage!). I thought they were going to shoot us. But Poldek kept saying, “Thomas, don’t you think this man has exactly the right heroic Polish features we need for the film?” Poldek had the right manners, demeanour and delivery to utter such complete rubbish with such conviction. To my amazement, the two soldiers gave him their names and addresses. Poldek said he would be in touch. And thus we got into the plane safe.
How did your novel catch Spielberg’s attention?
Poldek was the bridge between the book and the film. He knew Spielberg’s mother. But he treated the director like an office boy. He would say, “Steven, you can’t win Academy Awards by making films about little furry animals. You have to make a great film about humanity between human beings.” And then he uttered the war cry, ‘An Oscar for Oskar!’ Poldek was pleased when the director bought the rights to the novel in 1982 but he didn’t get around to making the film until 1992. At the Academy Awards ceremony in 1994 (when the film won seven Oscars), Spielberg walked into the Governor’s Ball with two Oscars in his hands, and Poldek grabbed one of them and said, “What did I tell you, what did I tell you?”
Did you like Spielberg’s cinematic adaptation of the book?
I hoped that the film would retain the same ambiguity about Oskar Schindler’s character and his motives. I think Spielberg got that right. I would have done some of the scenes differently, but I am not a filmmaker.
Have we learned anything from the past?
I don’t think we learn enough from the past. You’d think what happened during Partition would end all quarrels between people in India and Pakistan. But it hasn’t. It’s easier to disapprove of things that were done in the past than it is to disapprove of things happening, sometimes nearly as bad, in your own environment.
So it’s possible to say ‘tut tut’ about slaughters that occurred during Partition. But it is also possible for corporations, institutions and individuals to be unaware of injustice in their own backyard. The victims of the past were abstract and we didn’t know them. So we do not understand their intimate suffering, and it’s easier to disapprove of what’s happened to them than it is to be impassioned now. Most people in Australia would disapprove of the Holocaust but not all disapprove of the country’s policy concerning asylum-seekers, which I think is inhumane. They arrive by boat and are put in a prison-like detention centre and kept there indefinitely, sometimes for many years, before they are deported again.
Can literature and art change the world for the better?
Yes, in small ways. It’s hard to quantify. When you are writing a book, you can’t predict the effect it’s going to have. There is a good argument that writers should just write their books and let them have whatever large or small influence they have. There are books that raise consciousness. I recently read Barbara Tuchman’s Guns of August (about the onset of WW I). The late US President John F Kennedy had read it and when his military advisors were urging him to go to war with Russia he gave them this book and said, “This is what I don’t want to happen.”
I had also written a book about the war in east Africa called To Asmara. It did change attitudes about that war between Mengistu’s Ethiopians and the Eritreans. (Mengitsu Haile Mariam was formerly president of Ethiopia.) It’s hard to tell whether it shortened the war, but it certainly changed attitudes towards it. When I met Senator Ted Kennedy, he told me he too had read the book and was very anxious to do what he could to end that war.
Which books keep you occupied these days?
Reading’s a considerable joy, but it’s hard to get around all the books you should read. I recently read Gone Girl and Barbara Kingsolver’s Flight Behaviour, which was magnificent.
I revisited Middlemarch too, which, I think is the greatest novel in the English language. It means more to me now than when I was young (I was pretty dumb when I was young). Also, I read Homage to Catalonia by George Orwell (about the Spanish civil war).
I do a lot of reading while researching for books — books on 19th and 20th century history, biographies and books by Maxim Gorky and historians such as Simon Sebag Montefiore and Orlando Figes.
On a lighter note, are you enthusiastic about these literature festivals?
When I began going to fests in the 60s they were combative. In that period, the idea was you had to be an absolute ass**** to be a genius. If you were nice to people, it meant you had no talent. I am glad that has passed.

Can we trust Web journalismComments
By Stewart Baker November 9
I’ve spent the last couple of days meditating on the mistakes that web journalists make, and how those mistakes differ from mainstream media’s errors. The reason for the meditation is a weirdly escalating cycle of misquotation that I experienced last week.
In general, I don’t obsess about the mistakes that journalists make when I talk to them. If you get quoted a lot, you can expect to be misquoted a lot too, and it’s best to let it go. Reporters are in a hurry; or their editors lack context; mistakes happen. Complaining feels a little whiny, and in any event, readers are likely to forget the story before a correction hits the wires.
But I was struck by the way this particular misquotation bounced around the web, acquiring authority by repetition without ever being verified, and I suspect it tells us something troubling about where the press is going, even for those of us who celebrate the breaking of mainstream media’s narrative monopoly.
First, the background. I’m a skeptic about the Silicon Valley movement to increase the use of communications encryption that even the supplier can’t undo. I think it’s bad policy, and not particularly good business, for reasons I offered recently in a  NYT op-ed :
That decision should not be left to Apple alone. And it won’t be.
Companies do not want to give their employees the power to roam corporate networks in secrecy. And even if they did, their regulators wouldn’t let them. If Apple wants to sell iPhones for business use, it will have to give companies a way to read their employees’ business communications. Corporate IT departments won’t welcome a technology that could help workers hide misdeeds from their employer.
And as a global company, Apple is subject to regulation and market pressure everywhere. If China doesn’t like Apple’s new policy, it can ban the iPhone or simply encourage China’s mobile carriers to slow Apple’s already weak sales there. Even democracies like India, and U.S. allies like the United Arab Emirates, have shown the determination and the clout to force changes in phone makers’ security choices.
I repeated much the same view last week in Ireland, on stage with a Guardian editor, noting that Blackberry had run into real resistance in selling its end-to-end encrypted products in other markets. The Guardian wrote up the event in  a somewhat sloppy story :
 “Blackberry pioneered the same business model that Google and Apple are doing now – that has not ended well for Blackberry,” said Baker.
He claimed that by encrypting user data Blackberry had limited its business in countries that demand oversight of communication data, such as India and the UAE and got a bad reception in China and Russia. “They restricted their own ability to sell. We have a tendency to think that once the cyberwar is won in the US that that is the end of it – but that is the easiest war to swim.”
 The sloppiness of the story shows in its still-uncorrected “easiest war to swim” error, but also in its framing. The Guardian’s summary of my remarks begins with something I didn’t say: “Baker said encrypting user data had been a bad business model for Blackberry, which has had to dramatically downsize its business and refocus on business customers.” It’s a plausible misunderstanding of my remarks, but it’s wrong, as the Guardian could have easily found out during the many hours I spent that day with its reporter, James Ball.
What’s striking is what happened next. The error went from plausible misunderstanding to outright mischaracterization.  By the next day, several web outlets were using headlines like  this  one from ZDNet : “Former NSA’s chief lawyer: BlackBerry’s encryption efforts led to its demise.” This is unequivocally wrong, both as a summary of my remarks and as a matter of fact, not  least because Blackberry is far from demise.  But it’s also wrong more fundamentally; Blackberry’s strongest market is selling to enterprises, many of whom are attracted to the product precisely because it offers very strong encryption that is controlled by the company and not by the individual user. It is, if anything, an illustration of why encryption is a lot more complicated than Silicon Valley’s technolibertarian engineers seem to think.
That was not the end of the matter. There were soon a dozen or more web stories making similar claims, some from more or less respected outlets like  Slate ,  TechSpot , the  Daily Caller , the  Register , and the  Inquirer . Remarkably, many of them questioned the accuracy of blaming the “demise” of Blackberry on its strong encryption; in fact, they called that view everything from “strange” and “a bit of a stretch” to “absurd” and “laughable.” What they didn’t do was ask me whether I had actually made the claim that they considered so absurd and laughable. Not one of those web outlets called or wrote to ask for a followup quote or to confirm that I had made a statement they clearly thought no one in his right mind would make.
Why not? On reflection, I think it’s because they liked the idea that someone on the other side of the crypto debate was saying dumb things about Blackberry and its encryption. The dumber the better, in fact. Call it the Twitterization of debate: Anyone we disagree with must first be caricatured as a dolt and then dismissed in 140 characters. Or call it the metastasization of the Huffington Post clickbait stylebook: “You won’t believe this story showing how stupid/evil our opponents are!” Whatever, it’s an understandable tactic if you’re a partisan for a particular view. What’s striking is how far that partisan style has infiltrated web outlets that to all outward appearances are engaged in, you know, journalism. (Indeed, it has much the same effect as actual journalism; within two days, reporters were  asking Blackberry officials to respond  to the still-unchecked quote.)
The “story that’s too good to check” is part of newsroom lore, and an ever-present temptation for journalists. On the web, though, “too good to check” looks more and more like the norm, not the exception. And that’s a problem for consumers of news. Sites like Slate and the Register present themselves as opinion journalism. We expect them to give us the facts along with the attitude. But increasingly it looks as though their facts are as open to question as their opinions.

November 10, 2014:  
Savings bank account holders are walking around with a long face these days. Weighed down by rising prices and stagnant salaries, they now have an additional headache to bear. Henceforth, they will not have the convenience of walking across to the friendly neighbourhood ATM (automated teller machine) to draw money for free more than five times a month.
Those living in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad will have the convenience of only three transactions in a month if they were to use an ATM belonging to a bank where they don’t hold an account. For transactions over these limits, including balance confirmation and PIN change, the bank will levy a fee on them.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had in August allowed banks to levy such fees and it also set the limits for the number of free transactions terming it ‘rationalisation’. And banks have been quick to revise their charges once the RBI deadline of November 1 was crossed. Every transaction over the permitted limit will now cost Rs.20 plus service tax. Some banks charge half this for balance confirmation and PIN change.
HDFC Bank and Axis Bank have already intimated the new charges to their customers which will kick in from December 1, as have IOB and SBI which has adopted a nuanced stance on this issue. SBI customers, who hold more than Rs.25,000 in their SB accounts, will not be constrained by limits which will apply only to those holding less than that amount in their accounts. Other banks are either in the process of finalising their policy.
The RBI had to act after repeated representation from banks which have been complaining of the transaction costs that they have to bear every time a customer swipes his card in an ATM. In the process, it overturned its own earlier policy on this as set out in a March 2008 circular that expounded on the benefits of transacting through an ATM. This particular circular spoke about how in countries such as the U.K., Germany and France customers could access all ATMs, except white-label ones, free of charge.
“The ideal situation is that a customer should be able to access any ATM installed in the country free of charge through an equitable cooperative initiative by banks,” the circular dated March 10, 2008 had said while asking banks to allow unlimited free transactions at ATMs in India.
In contrast, the central bank now talks about “the growing cost of ATM deployment and maintenance” for banks. And what is that cost? It ranges between Rs.18 and Rs.25 per transaction, say banks.
These developments are ironic indeed considering that ATM growth really took off in the last few years after the RBI made transactions free of charges. As per latest RBI data, there are an estimated 1.6 lakh ATMs in the country which is almost six times the 27,000 ATMs that India had in March 2007.
Banks expanded their ATM networks rapidly to draw in customers and also drive them away from the branches; servicing simple requests such as withdrawals and balance confirmation at branches was estimated to be more expensive than through ATMs.
According to one private bank, servicing a customer at the branch costs Rs.40 per transaction. Indeed, some private banks, and well-known ones at that, imposed a fee on customers who visited their branches for transacting more than a specified number of times in a given period. The aim was to reduce footfalls in the branch and run a lean operation. Having achieved that objective and hooking customers to ATMs, how is it fair to now impose a limit on free transactions?
For their part, the banks say that the aim is to increase non-cash transactions and drive people into digital banking. A digital, cash-free economy is a laudable objective indeed but achieving that involves many simultaneous steps. The RBI and banks would like people to use their debit/credit cards more, even for minor transactions at the grocer or the chemist as it happens abroad. Yet, the truth is that many small merchant establishments with point of sale (POS) machines charge customers anything up to 2.5 per cent as transaction fee when it is paid by card.
In fact, banks charge an additional fee when their cards are used at petrol bunks. Such fees and surcharges defeat the objective of pushing people into using their cards more. Banks also need to spread the reach of POSs. In the last seven years, the number of POSs in the country has trebled to 10.65 lakh from 3.2 lakh, according to the RBI. This is commendable but we need greater reach into smaller establishments.
Students and senior citizens, who prefer drawing small sums at frequent intervals for reasons of convenience and safety, are likely to be affected the most by the new ATM rule.
While students may find it easier to adapt to the new norms, the same cannot be said of senior citizens. Again, customers in the cities may be better placed to move to digital banking but the same cannot be said of those in rural and semi-urban centres, at least not yet.
Digital banking yet to spread
Poor Internet penetration, including inadequate bandwidth, power cuts and low literacy levels are factors that work against the spread of digital banking in rural areas.
Though financial inclusion account holders are exempt from the ATM rule, it needs to be pointed out that not all rural account holders fall in this category.
Changing banking habits is a slow process and that needs to be recognised by banks and the RBI. A gradual transition to digital banking would have been the ideal thing to do in a country of India’s size and complexity. Till such time that the ecosystem for digital banking and card payments improve, a more relaxed ATM usage policy is probably necessary.

Defence deals to be transparent  | Parrikar  the man with impeccable integrityBJP
(58-year-old Parrikar met…)
NEW DELHI: Manohar Parrikar today took charge as Defence Minister and said the defence acquisition process will be transparent and fast under his stewardship.
58-year-old Parrikar met with Defence Secretary R K Mathur and all the three Services Chiefs minutes after he took over in his South Block Office.
The new Minister echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make-in-India" slogan and said the country should manufacture "as much as possible" domestically.
"Very unfortunate. Whatever will be there will be very transparent but fast process. I think that is one of my specialties," he told reporters here replying to a question about the delayed acquisition process in the last 10 years and defence deals often getting mired in corruption.
He asked everyone to give him time to understand the issues concerning the new Ministry.
Parrikar, who earlier today filed his nomination paper to Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, said he was "equally worried" over the recent sinking of a torpedo recovery vessel off the coast of Visakhapatnam and recalled the series of accidents that the Navy has had over the last year and a half.
"Let me first take real grip of the situation so that the exact position can be expressed to you," he said.
With his task cut-out, Parrikar, an IITian, thanked Modi for reposing confidence in him by giving him this "very important and sensitive Ministry".
"I am also aware that Jaitley (who was holding Defence as an additional charge) has done, in spite of constraints, a lot of initiation work on many of the issues concerning the defence and I am quite confident of taking them ahead with speed," he said.
The former Goa Chief Minister admitted though he has exposure and good administrative experience, the type of requirement at the national level may be different.
"I was left with no time. Let me be frank. I had to virtually pack in five minutes. Two days was given for all the excercise," he said while requesting the media to give him time to understand the issues concerning the Ministry.
Asked about Modi's "Make-in-India" slogan, Parrikar said the Prime Minister has been very clear in opening up of the defence sector.
"I feel that as much as possible we should manufacture here in India. Any country with good manufacturing ways, irrespective of defence or any other, can come up economically by generating a lot of employment opportunities," he said adding he hopes to make use of his ministerial colleague Rajiv Pratap Rudy's new Skill Development Ministry.
"Skill development is a very important issue and the reason why we need that is that in earlier years, skill was passed down (generations). Now we have to train people. New skills have come up, new requirement. We need to develop that fast. Defence also needs it in all angles," he said.
Defence Ministry sources said that over the next few days, Parrikar will get detailed briefings from each of the Services - Army, Air Force and Navy.
A metallurgy graduate from IIT, Bombay, Parrikar has a long road ahead as the forces will look up to him to fix the country's outdated weapons system and go in for faster acquisition.
  He will have to walk a tight rope in the wake of allegations of corruption in defence contracts in the country.
Jaitley has already set in motion the process of acquiring Apache attack helicopters and Chinook heavy lift helicopters for the IAF besides the Israeli anti-tank missile Spike.
He has scrapped the controversial tender for 197 Light Utility Helicopters and opened projects for Indian industry -- including the making of six submarines and replacement of Avro transport aircraft.
Among the first major issues Parrikar would have to decide is the multi-billion 126 Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft.
Final negotiations have been on for the last three years after the then government selected French's Dassault Rafale.
The contract is critical for the depleted fighter fleet of IAF which needs at least 39 squadrons of fighter planes but has only 32.

Jeevan Pramaan: PM launches Aadhar-based Digital Life Certificate for pensionersAadhar
(According to PM Modi, Jeevan…)
NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at benefitting over a crore pensioners, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched 'Jeevan Pramaan - Digital Life Certificate for Pensioners'.
According to PM Modi, Jeevan Pramaan , which is an Aadhar-based Digital Life Certificate, will be an enabling mechanism which would benefit the common man. The proposed digital certification will do away with the requirement of a pensioner having to submit a physical Life Certificate in November each year, in order to ensure continuity of pension being credited into his account.
This step brings comfort & convenience. Pensioners will not have to submit physical Life certificates every year for pension continuity.

"The Department of Electronics and IT has developed a software application which will enable the recording of the pensioner's Aadhar number and biometric details from his mobile device or computer, by plugging in a biometric reading device. Key details of the pensioner, including date, time, and biometric information will be uploaded to a central database on real-time basis, ultimately enabling the Pension Disbursing Agency to access a Digital Life Certificate. This will conclusively establish that the pensioner was alive at the time of authentication," a press release said.
The earlier requirement entailed that a pensioner either personally presents himself before the Pension Disbursing Agency, or submits a Life Certificate issued by authorities specified by the Central Pension Accounting Office (CPAO).
At present, 50 lakh individuals draw pension from the Central Government alone. A similar number draw pension from State and Union Territory Governments. Several PSUs also provide pension benefits. Over 25 lakh retired personnel draw pension from the Armed Forces. "The Aadhar-Based Digital Life Certificate will go a long way in reducing hardship which so many senior citizens have to go through to produce a Life Certificate every year," the press release added.
The software application system will be made available to pensioners and other stakeholders on a large scale at no extra cost. "It can be operated on a personal computer or a smartphone, along with an inexpensive biometric reading device. This facility will also be made available at Common Service Centres being operated under the National e-Governance Plan, for the benefit of pensioners residing in remote and inaccessible areas," the press release said.

Nifty Edges Higher To Notch Up New Closing Record
Reuters | Updated On: November 10, 2014 18:25 (IST)
Gold Prices Plunge by Rs 195 on Weak Global Cues
The BSE Sensex and Nifty hit record highs on Monday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's push to expand his cabinet raised further hopes for economic reforms, but gave up most of their gains towards the end of the session as investors booked profits.
The Sensex earlier rose as much as 0.57 percent to a record high of 28,027.96, its fifth all-time high in six sessions.
Mr Modi beefed up his cabinet on Sunday, appointing a separate defence minister to spur military modernization and free Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to focus on the budget and reforms to revive the economy.
The larger cabinet was welcomed by business groups impatient for the Modi government to get the economy out of a long slowdown.
But traders also said the temptation to book profits was high ahead of consumer inflation data on Wednesday and given recent strong gains. The Sensex has gained 32.30 percent this year making India the best performing equity market in Asia.
"The freedom to chose cabinet underscores Modi's ability to take fast decisions. This phase of profit-taking would not last for long," said G. Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics, a research and fund advisory firm.
The benchmark Sensex rose 0.02 percent, or 6.10 points, to end at 27,874.73.
The broader Nifty edged up 0.09 percent, or 7.25 points, to end at 8,344.25, also marking its record close.
Among top gainers, ITC Ltd, the country's largest cigarette maker, surged 4.5 percent on hopes the new health minister may not pursue a much speculated tax increase.
Other defensive stocks also led the gains as investors turned to safe havens amid string of record highs on indexes.
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd ended 1.9 percent higher after earlier hitting an all-time high of Rs 932.5 after unit Taro Pharmaceutical Industries' results.
Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Ltd and Hindustan Unilever Ltd ended up 1.3 percent each.
Among other stocks, Jet Airways Ltd rose 6.9 percent on results and fund raising plan.
Crompton Greaves Ltd gained 2.8 percent after the company said it would seek shareholder approval to hike foreign portfolio investment limit.
Also, railway stocks rallied after the appointment of new Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu stoked hopes for reforms and investment into the sector, traders said.
Texmaco Rail and Engineering Ltd shares surged 9.1 percent, while Titagarh Wagons Ltd rose 4.2 percent.
However among stocks that fell, Larsen and Toubro Ltd fell 2.1 percent after the company's July-September earnings missed analyst's estimates.
Investors also booked profits in recent outperformers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp, which fell 3.8 percent, and Tata Motors, down 2.1 percent.

Vodafone moves HC accusing DoT of delaying signing of licence
PTI Nov 10, 2014, 08.09PM IST
(Vodafone has contended…)
NEW DELHI: Vodafone today moved the Delhi High Court alleging the Centre is indulging in "arm-twisting" and "coercive" tactics by refusing to sign its unified licence (UL) till the telecom major unconditionally accepts the "restrictive" clauses in the licence.
Vodafone has contended in its plea that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) showed them a copy of the UL only on November 3 and the company had on November 5 written to the government to remove the "restrictive clauses" prohibiting the telecom major from entering into intra-circle roaming (ICR) pacts.
"However, petitioners (Vodafone) were surprised that instead of signing and executing the ULs, the respondent (DoT) wrongly, unreasonably and arbitrarily and at the last moment informed that the letter of November 5 is a conditional compliance and not acceptable.
"DoT also informed that petitioners' request for deletion of restrictive clauses in UL pertaining to roaming cannot be accepted. It is submitted that said restrictive clauses in the UL take away the rights already granted to petitioner and as upheld by TDSAT on April 29, 2014," the petition has said.
TDSAT had on April 29 overturned a government ban on offering 3G mobile services beyond their licensed zones through roaming pacts saying it was in national interest to allow better utilisation of scarce radio frequency.
It has sought orders declaring the "restrictive clauses" as illegal and their deletion from the UL.
The matter is likely to be heard tomorrow. The telecom major has accused DoT of "adopting coercive steps" saying "if UL is not signed in a timely manner, then the existing 22 million subscribers in three service areas - Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata - of the petitioners, being provided services under existing unified access service licence (UASL), will face disruption of services after November 29, 2014."
Vodafone's UASL for these service areas is set to expire on November 29.
Vodafone has also contended in its plea that as it was in a "vulnerable" position, owing to impending expiry of its UASL, and DoT, being aware of consequences for the company "is arm-twisting, abusing its position/powers as a licensor to delay and deny" the telecom major's entitlement to use the spectrum obtained in the auctions.
Vodafone has contended that it bought/acquired spectrum in 2010 and 2014 at a total cost of around Rs 24,000 crore, of which Rs 12,000 crore has already been paid.
"Respondent, after taking such huge amounts paid towards spectrum, cannot now adopt coercive measure for signing UL with the petitioners," the petition has said.
According to Vodafone's plea, DoT has already accepted their applications, conveyed approvals and issued Letters of Intent (LoI) on August 28, September 15 and September 23 for Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi areas respectively.
The company has claimed that it too has unequivocally and unconditionally accepted these LoIs and have fulfilled each and every requisite condition thereunder through their acceptance letters.
As per the new telecom policy, unified licences are to be given to telecom companies to use the spectrum acquired by them and provide mobile services to their subscribers.
Vodafone has also contended in its plea that the UL of another telecom service provider was signed only after it moved the Bombay High Court.
Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular, the three biggest mobile service providers in the country, and Reliance Jio were among eight companies that bid a combined Rs 61,162 crore for spectrum in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands offered by the government during a 10-day auction that ended on February 13 this year.

Shiv Sena decides to sit in Opposition in MaharashtraLetters to  the editor
Putting an end to speculation over its participation in the BJP-led government in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena today decided to sit in the Opposition, a day after serving an ultimatum to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to come clear within two days on taking NCP support for survival of its minority dispensation.
The sudden move came on a day when NCP chief Sharad Pawar reiterated his party’s decision to extend outside support to the Devendra Fadnavis government during the crucial trust vote on November 12.
A letter from Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray seeking the post of Leader of Opposition for its Legislature Party leader Eknath Shinde was delivered to the state Assembly Secretary Anant Kalse, party spokesperson Neelam Gorhe told reporters.
“A letter written by our President Uddhav Thackeray was submitted to Anant Kalse informing him that Eknath Shinde has been appointed as the leader of the Shiv Sena Legislature Party.
“Since we are the second largest party in the House with 63 MLAs, it is appropriate to appoint our leader as Leader of Opposition. We expect Shinde’s name to be announced as early as possible,” she said.
After boycotting the first expansion of the Union Council of Ministers and recalling Rajya Sabha member Anil Desai, who too was to be sworn-in as a minister yesterday, from Delhi airport, Uddhav had last evening served an ultimatum to BJP asking it to make clear its stand on taking NCP’s support to bail out the government in Maharashtra.
“If we don’t get a satisfactory answer (from BJP) in next two days, we will sit in Opposition,” Uddhav had said last evening after a meeting of party legislators where he appointed Shinde as their leader.
As Pawar, whose party has 41 MLAs in the Assembly, held forth on the reason for extending outside support to the Fadnavis government at a news conference, Sena, apparently peeved at lack of response from BJP to its ultimatum, made up its mind to occupy the space of the main Opposition party.
BJP, following promise of NCP’s support, reacted to Sena’s move with self-assurance, saying, “It is their right” and “who had asked them to join government?”
“Since they have got the largest number of seats among Opposition parties, it is their right to have the Leader of Opposition’s post. We extend them our best wishes,” Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse told reporters.
When asked how BJP with 121 MLAs will be able to prove a majority in the House which has an effective strength of 287, Khadse said, “We can’t reveal our strategy, but you will see on Wednesday we will win a comfortable majority and run the state comfortably.”
“There are several options. Many people have met and said they will vote for us… be with us,” he said.
Pawar told a press conference that the decision to back the minority government was “conscious and collective” and not part of a “hidden deal” with BJP.
“We have not discussed our decision with any one. It was a conscious and collective decision in the larger interest of the state. Nobody asked us for our support. BJP is free to not accept our support,” he said.
Pawar said since Congress and NCP were not in a position to provide an alternative government, the only way to avoid a fresh poll was to back the BJP dispensation.
“The number game is such that there is no (possibility of) alternative arrangement. We don’t want the state to go for another election immediately,” he said.
Rubbishing suggestions that NCP had lent unconditional outside support to the BJP government as part of a “hidden deal”, Pawar said, “The government is free to investigate all the charges and allegations against NCP leaders so the truth can come out. If its decisions or bills are not people oriented, we will not support the government.”
“Even though NCP will not destabilise the government, it will play the role of an effective Opposition,” he said.
However, the wily Maratha leader appeared to put a question mark on the longevity of the BJP government when he said he had never claimed it will last its full term.
“I never said this government would last for 5 years,” he said, replying to a query, adding, “we will be a formidable opposition.”
41-member NCP holds key to the survival of the Devendra Fadnavis government. With the 63-member Shiv Sena deciding to sit in the opposition, the minority Fadnavis dispensation can win the trust vote with the help of either active voting by NCP or through abstention.
BJP has 121 MLAs in the Assembly with effective strength of 287, still 24 short of a majority. With the help of 7 independents and few others from smaller parties, it can reduce the gap but cannot bridge it completely.
Several attempts were made by leaders of BJP and Shiv Sena over the last few days for a rapprochement between the two Hindutva fellow travellers but finally all came to a nought.
Uddhav’s last-minute arrival at the swearing-in ceremony of the Fadnavis government had revived hopes of a reunion but the two parties could not iron out their differences over Sena’s demand for Deputy Chief Minister’s post and a substantial share in the ministerial pie and key portfolios.
It is not clear yet whether Sena will pull out its lone member Anant Geete from the Union Cabinet and sit in Opposition in Lok Sabha too.
The two parties have been sharing power in the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation for a log time and there is still no clarity on whether they will continue their alliance in the civic body or part ways.

How to Hire the Right Web Designerreddit
Hiring a web designer or design company can seem like a daunting task. Too many speak in nerd and the good ones never seem available to take on new work.
I realize that maybe your cousin is a web designer who builds websites on the side. Or that your friend's brother in college once updated your Tumblr in exchange for a case of beer. Or that you can, quite easily, figure out web design, programming and WordPress yourself, but you just haven't found the time.
Web designers hear these types of comments a lot (possibly second only to "make the logo bigger" on mockups). While there's nothing wrong with learning new things or having hobbies, for the love of whatever god you believe in, hire a professional to design and program your website. Professional, as in someone who does web design full-time, as a job that they get paid money to do, and has done so for a while.
How do you find the right professional web designer? Do you walk into a hip coffee shop and look for plaid shirts, tattooed fingers and Apple laptops? While that would probably work, it makes more sense to start by looking at websites you enjoy visiting, and that appear to have a good community and engaged following. Does it say at the bottom of the website who designed and programmed it? If not, send a brief email to the website's owner, asking who they used and if they were happy with their designer.
Make a shortlist of designers (two or three) you want to work with (from looking at those sites you like and asking who built them). What are their portfolios like? Can you get behind the tone, aesthetics and presentation of their own websites and other websites they've done? Are their project sizes (features, functions, what the site does, etc.) similar in scope to yours?
Contact these web designers and actually talk to them on the phone (old school, I know). You want to make sure you understand how they communicate, since they'll be responsible for visually communicating your online business. Do they talk in technical jargon or Star Trek references (although the latter could be a bonus)? Are they clear about what they can provide for you? What is their process?
Ask for references and actually contact them. Ask each reference what it was like to work with the web designer. Find out if they delivered on time, on budget, and if the client could honestly recommend them.
There's no industry standard for pricing a website. They can cost next to nothing to well into six figures. Since you already have a good idea of your budget, see what the designer's average project typically costs to determine if your budget fits into that range. If the two numbers are way off, it's best to find out early to avoid wasting anyone's time.
Chances are if you've found a web designer who's responsible for a popular website, they're fully booked for a little while. Most good web designers are slammed (my own schedule books months in advance). So find out when they could start a project with you and how long projects typically take. There's so much you can do before a project starts, and waiting a while gives you a chance to do your own homework (see chapter title Your project responsibilities).
Be prepared to adjust time and money if none of the professionals you want to hire can work with your budget or timeline. Maybe that means waiting a little longer or saving up a little more. That just gives you more time to focus on your business idea, products/services and value.
Here's a list of important questions to ask before you hire anyone.
Can you provide a list of three to five references I can contact?
Do you do this full-time and how long have you been doing web design?
What is your process?
What is the typical budget range for your projects? how are payments broken down for projects?
What is the typical turn-around time for your projects?
When can the project be started?
What do you need from me before we start?
Do your clients see a return on investment? Do you have proof of increased conversion rates or goals being achieved after you've done a redesign?
Does the price include making the site mobile friendly?
Will the site be supported by retina screens?
Do you custom design or use templates?
Who will own the website design when it's paid for?
Do you offer maintenance or training or post-launch support?
Who is the contact person and who is doing the work? is anything outsourced or subcontracted out?
As important as any of these questions is understanding and communication. Do you understand what they are talking about when they are describing what they do or what they can do for you?
Ease of communication is key in any project, especially a web design project, where things can get confusing or misaligned due to jargon or tech speak.

Quit Taking It Personally With Your Job Searchreddit
I recently heard this bit of useful advice: keep a bunch of Q-Tips at your desk so that anytime you find yourself taking something personally you can remind yourself to "Quit Taking It Personally." I love this because so many times I find myself thinking "it's about me" when really whatever fill-in-the-blank scenario has nothing at all to do with me. Many jobseekers struggle in this area as well in ways that ultimately hold them back from moving forward, especially when it comes to reaching out to people.
The number one mistake I see from jobseekers is taking it personally when people do not get back to them for networking requests. My friend Zach, a smart professional, told me he sent five emails to acquaintances asking for a few minutes to speak with them related to his job search. When he didn't hear back, he assumed they didn't want to help him and that was the end of it. He was disappointed and went back to slogging through online job boards.
It's not uncommon to think the way Zach did. However, most people are not purposely avoiding your email. They are simply busy with inboxes full of many other emails. It's your job to re-forward the email after two weeks and say something along the lines of, "Just following up on the message below. I look forward to hearing from you." Personally, I average two or even three emails for every one I receive back, especially from people I'm not usually in contact with. This is the new normal of our overly stimulated technology-rich lives. If after one or two more tries you still do not hear back, then you can move on to another contact. I once reached back out to someone a year later who I really wanted to connect to by forwarding the original communication. It turns out she was getting married at the time of my original ask and the timing was much better in the following year. It was worth the wait to speak to her.
Knowing that asking for help is hard for most people, it's even more tempting to feel bad when you do not receive a response after putting yourself out there. I encourage you the next time you're inclined to think it's about you, to quit taking it personally and simply take the next step of following up.
Note: Make sure your original email was not untailored, overly long, or asking too much. When in doubt, ask a savvy friend to review your message. See Ask Your Network for Job Search Help Using the Two-Part Email for more on effective networking.
What other ways might you be taking it personally in your job search when it may not be about you at all?

You Can Stay Ahead of 90 Percent of the People... Just By Showing Up!reddit
Background -- My name is Mark Wayman and for the last 10 years I have owned an Executive Recruiting company focused on gaming/casinos and high tech.  This year I placed six executives north of a million dollars.  My last article was titled "What Josh Altman (Million Dollar LA Listing) Taught Me About Networking." I'll give you the conclusion to the Josh Altman experience at the end of the article. Today's focus is on one of my primary business principles for success -- showing up.
The Godfather Sit Downs -- Many years ago I started hosting mixers in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Palo Alto.  Invite-only for my friends, clients and business partners.  Guest list is "C" level corporate executives, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, entertainers.  Exactly one purpose - for my friends, clients and business partners to meet each other. Exactly one rule -- absolutely no selling, marketing, promoting of soliciting.  Just an opportunity to meet 70 high quality people at an attractive venue with no pressure or agenda.
The No Shows -- The most interesting part of my private events is how many people don't show up!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we are all busy, but you miss out on 100 percent of the shots you don't take.  Someone once said that "good luck" is mostly hard work and showing up.  By ducking out, you accomplish three things.  First, you miss out on meeting new people and creating new relationships. Second, you miss out on any opportunities that might present themselves. Third, you may not get invited back!
No Shows for Charity Events - Especially disappointing are folks that don't show up for charity events.  On several occasions I had people drop out after I paid $1,000 for their seats. Mediocre people are "no show, no call." Good people will give you plenty of notice and offer to donate to the charity. Let me tell you what "no call no show" translates to, "Our relationship is not important to me. You are not important to me." And that, my friends, is a bad deal.  The host gets offended and certainly does not strengthen the relationship. Ten years ago my mixers had a 20 percent "no show" rate. Today three percent, because the "no show no calls" don't get invited back.
My Favorite No Show Story - One of my favorite stories is about a CIO event I hosted at Hollywood Park.  Of the 30 CIOs on the guest list, only 15 showed up.  The day after the event, two of the "no show, no calls" sent me resumes and asked for jobs.  Seriously?  I have never met you, you don't show up for an hour to meet in person and shake hands, but you want me to place you in a $400,000 job?  I love that strategy!
Acceptable Reasons - Obviously there are emergencies and valid reasons for not having to cancel.  Here are a few good ones:
Sick or Medical Emergency - Completely understandable.  Things happen, and family always come first.  But being "tired" does not count.  We are all tired; we are all busy.  I once hosted and Oscar Party for the Arthritis Foundation with a 104 degree fever.  Five hundred people were counting on me, so I dragged myself out of bed and honored the commitment.  My wife once attended a dinner party when she was REALLY under the weather.  She made the best of it and had hot toddies all night.
Client Related - For my entrepreneur friends, if you don't sell...you don't eat.  This one I am intimately familiar with.  If you own the business and need to focus on a client situation, that is perfectly acceptable.
Work Related - For my celebrity friends, if they get a paid gig...they are out.  For my CEO friends, sometimes critical issues come up and as the #1 in the company, they need to give it their full attention.
Not So Acceptable Excuses - There are too many excuses to mention.  I have seen and heard them all.  Here are a few common ones:
I'm Too Important - Yeah, I don't know about that.  The folks at my event are high profile, highly successful, and in many cases, high net worth.  If you don't show up though, you will never know.
Too or Busy - We are all busy. I get 50 phone calls and 400 emails a day, however if I make a commitment to attend, I keep it.  For my personal event, the value proposition of meeting 70 executives is HUGE.  Where are you going to meet 70 high quality people, all in one place, and all in one night?
Bigger Name on the Other Line - This is a hot button for me.  You made the commitment, and now you have a "cooler" offer.  Personally, I don't do that.  If I say I'll be there, I'll be there.  OK, maybe if Jesus calls, I will need to duck out, but not for anyone else.
Sounded Like a Good Idea at the Time - This is probably the most frequent excuse. And when I look at my guest lists, I can almost always pick out the ones that won't show.  They are the people that drive you crazy trying to get ON the list...then don't show up.  All I can say is you are going to miss out on many, many opportunities.
So Josh Altman and I were supposed to meet prior to my last Los Angeles event.  He emailed me just prior and said he had another commitment.  Don't really know him, and I'm sure he had a great reason.  That stated, he missed out on an opportunity to meet an executive with 5,000+ executives in his rolodex.  Next!

Does equity risk really fall with timeDoes equity risk really fall with time?
B Venkatesh
Tweet
Risks falling over the years will make it easy to build wealth. But is it too good to be true?
Do you believe that equity is less risky in the long term? Experts have long debated whether time diversification – in finance-speak, that means equity becomes less risky the longer you hold it – is myth or reality. The debate is yet to settle.
Here, we discuss the relevance of time diversification and how you should invest to meet your life goals.
Relevance
Suppose stocks are less risky in the long term. You have to only invest in equity to meet your long-term goals. These are goals that you want to achieve in 10 years’ time or more.
Experts who believe equity is not less risky in the long term base their argument on investment concepts. And those who believe equity is less risky in the long-term depend on past stock market performance to support their viewpoint.
Why is this debate important to you? For one, if equity is indeed less risky in the long-term, you need less investment capital to meet your long-term goals. You will increase your equity allocation as you “know” equity risk will reduce with time. And because equity generates higher returns than bonds, you need less investment capital to achieve your long-term goals.
For another, you need not worry about short-term declines in your equity investments. If equity is less risky in the long term, it means the stock market will bounce back to recover the losses you suffered early on in your investment horizon.
The issues
The question is: are you willing to bet on time diversification and increase your equity allocation to meet your long-term goals? And remember, even if the risk decreases with time, your absolute loss can be higher because your portfolio value will increase with time!
Even if equity investment is less risky in the long term, stock prices tend to fluctuate in the short term. Can you withstand the short-term fluctuations in the interest of achieving your long-term goals?
If you are a typical investor, chances are that you will be gripped with fear when you witness such short-term fluctuations. Your emotional mind often imagines that the recent short-term event is more likely to occur in the future. This belief could prompt you to sell your long-term investments based on short-term fluctuations.
Next, consider the technical argument. The short-term fluctuations in stock prices can hurt your long-term goals. Suppose your portfolio has unrealised gains of 25 per cent. It only takes a 20 per cent decline in the market to wipe out the gains in your portfolio.
On the other hand, if your portfolio has unrealised losses of 25 per cent, the stock market has to move up by 33 per cent to recover just your capital!
So even if equity is less risky in the long-term, you have to weather short-term fluctuations in equity investments to achieve your long-term goals.
Conclusion
You should make your investment decisions based on the three following points:
One, invest in bonds if your time horizon is 5 years or less.
Two, invest in equity and bonds if your time horizon is more than five years. Reduce your equity allocation as your time horizon draws nearer.
Three, if you are investing to achieve an important life goal, first estimate the minimum amount you need to prevent complete failure of the goal. Then, invest in bonds such that the maturity value equals the minimum amount; invest the rest in equity.

Rupee under pressureStrength in the dollar can pull the rupee toward the 62-mark
November 9, 2014:  
The Indian rupee is slowly beginning to feel the heat of the global dollar strength. The currency opened the week lower at 61.49 on Monday and strengthened to 61.34 on Wednesday. However, it subsequently fell below its key support of 61.50 and dropped to a low of 61.675 on Friday. The currency closed at 61.64, down 0.44 per cent for the week.
Data watch
Macro economic data releases in the past week were mixed. HSBC’s Manufacturing Production Managers’ Index (PMI) inched up to 51.6 in October from 51 in the previous month.
But HSBC’s Services PMI tumbled to a six-month low of 50 in October from 51.6 in September. The trend in the services sector PMI suggests that there is a danger of a fall below 50 — this would imply a contraction in services output. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net buyers of both equity and debt in the past truncated week. They bought $124.6 million of debt and equities worth $718.5 million last week.
Dollar outlook
The dollar index (87.64) extended its rally in the past week, as expected. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signalling more stimulus measures on Thursday helped the dollar index surge to a high of 88.19 on Friday. However, the index gave back some of its gains in the final trading sessions after US non-farm payroll data failed to match up to market expectations.
The price action in the coming days for the dollar index is going to be crucial. Key resistance is at 88.4 and could be tested in the coming days.
A strong breach of this hurdle will add momentum to the current rally and will take the index higher toward 90 in the coming weeks.
On the other hand, inability to breach 88.4 and a sharp reversal could cause a corrective fall, which will have the potential to drag the index lower to even 85 levels.
All three major components of the dollar index — the euro (1.2450), Japanese yen (114.58) and pound (1.5861) — are trading weak against the dollar.
Rupee outlook
The fall below 61.5 last week is very significant. It has increased pressure on the currency. The level of 61.5 will now be an immediate hurdle that could restrict any immediate rise in the rupee. The rupee could weaken to 61.9 this week. Declines below this level could drag it lower to 62.25 in the short term.
Strength in the rupee is likely to be seen only if it breaches its immediate resistance at 61.5. Such a break could take the rupee higher to 61.35. But the rupee breaching 61.5 looks less likely, based on the charts.
The medium-term bearish outlook remains intact. The key support for the rupee is now at 62.25. A break below this level could see the rupee weaken toward 63.7 in the medium term.
A cup-and-handle pattern formation is visible on the charts, which supports the bearish view for the rupee, and increases the likelihood of the currency falling to 63.7 in the medium term.

Kumar Mangalam Birla coal scam case: CBI does U-turn  now says enough evidence to take cognisanceEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
In an apparent U-turn, CBI, which had filed a closure report in a coal blocks case involving industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla, former coal secretary P C Parakh and others, today told a special court there was enough evidence against the accused to take cognisance of offences.
The Supreme Court appointed-special public prosecutor (SPP) R S Cheema submitted before Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar that the court can take cognisance on the closure report filed by it on October 21 as there was prima facie “evidence against the accused to show their involvement”.
The court after hearing the submissions advanced by Cheema and CBI prosecutors V K Sharma and A P Singh fixed the matter for November 25 for consideration of the agency’s closure report.
“SPP states that under the facts and circumstances of the case, prima facie there is enough material to take cognizance of the offences against private parties and some of the government officials involved in the process of coal blocks allocation. Put up for consideration on the closure report on November 25,” the judge said.
The CBI also placed on record a compilation of relevant documents relating to the case.
During the hearing, Cheema said, “We are asking for cognisance on the closure report as there was evidence against the accused to show their involvement.”
The judge asked the prosecutor that if the court decides to take cognisance of the offences, will the agency be ready with its documents.
To this, Cheema said some further investigation was required in the matter.
Earlier, on October 21, CBI had filed a “detailed and comprehensive” revised final closure report before a the court in the case.
The FIR against Kumar Mangalam Birla, Parakh and others was registered in October last year by CBI which had alleged that Parakh had reversed his decision to reject coal block allocation to Hindalco  Industries within months “without any valid basis or change in circumstances” and shown “undue favours”.
The FIR relates to allocation of Talabira II and III coal blocks in 2005.
On September 12, the court had asked CBI what was the hurry in closing the case in which FIR was registered against Birla, Parakh and others after it first filed the closure report on August 28.
CBI had booked Birla, Parakh and other officials of Hindalco under various IPC sections, including criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct on the part of government officials.
In its FIR, the agency had alleged that during the 25th Screening Committee meeting, chaired by Parakh, applications of Hindalco and Indal Industries were rejected for mining in Talabira II and III “citing valid reasons”.

One in 3 Indian youth cyberbullied due to risky behaviour: McAfeeEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
McAfee, part of Intel Security, has  released findings of its annual study, the Tweens, Teens and Technology 2014 report, which examines the online behaviour and social networking habits of Indian tweens and teens, and aims to educate on the impact that risky behaviour has on their privacy, reputation and social media experiences.
According to the research, half (50%) of the youth in India have had some experience with cyber-bullying (been cyberbullied online or witnessed others being cyberbullied), out of which one-third (36%) have been cyberbullied themselves. This behaviour was perceived to result in anger and embarrassment, showcasing how online behaviour translates into offline impact.
“Teens and tweens are very comfortable operating in the online world, yet the risks have never been greater. Young people are often the pioneers for new technologies so they need to understand the consequences of their online behaviour and how they can maintain their social engagement,” said Melanie Duca, APAC Consumer Marketing Director, McAfee, part of Intel Security
The study highlights how risky online activity can possibly make them even more susceptible to cyberbullying, substantiated through some of the following statistics.
 
Need to be constantly connected
An eye-opening trend is that half (52%) of India’s youth even access their social media accounts while at school, with tweens (57%) being more connected during school hours than teens (47%). Even though the minimum age to register to on social networking sites like Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest, Tinder, Tumblr, and Vine is 13, 10-12 year olds report higher daily access to than their teen counterparts.
Oversharing of risky information
Despite a majority (80%) of Indian youth being aware that their online activity can affect their identity, 92% have done or posted something risky online. An added fact is that of these, 70% have posted their contact details like email, phone and home address.
Youth are increasingly trusting unknown people in the virtual world, in spite of being aware that it is risky. 53% have met someone in person that they first met online. 63% of youth do not turn off their location or GPS services across apps, leaving their locations visible to strangers.
Finding Social Acceptance
Another critical concern stemming from peer pressure is youth feeling compelled to portray an untrue image of themselves online. 64% even admit to trying  to reinvent their online personas making themselves appear older, creating fake profiles or posting photos that are not their own. Moreover, 46% say they would put themselves in danger to see more engagement/ activity on their posts (e.g., more likes, comments, shares or retweets).
Lack of parental involvement
Only 46% say their parents have had a conversation with them about online safety. Others say their parents simply don’t care (52%).
Top 5 Tips for Parents to Help Educate Their Kids:
1. Connect with your kids. Casually talk to them about the risks of all online connections and make sure the communication lines are open.
2. Gain access. Have passwords for your children’s social media accounts and passcodes to their children’s devices to have full access at any given moment.
3. Learn their technology. Stay one step ahead and take the time to research the various devices your kids use. You want to know more about their devices than they do.
4. Get social. Stay knowledgeable about the newest and latest social networks. You don’t have to create an account but it is important to understand how they work and if your kids are on them.
5. Reputation management. Make sure your kids are aware anything they post online does not have an expiration date.

Sainsbury’s to cut stores and dividend
The supermarket's sales are falling for the first time in decade as Britain’s “big four” grocery retailers fight shifts in shopping habits and the rise of    the discounters Aldi and Lidl

Comments
J Sainsbury is to scrap a giant programme of store openings and slash its    dividend, as part of a dramatic overhaul drawn up to fight falling sales.
The supermarket giant will this week unveil the results of a strategic review,    which is expected to reveal that Sainsbury’s is reining in costs in an    effort to save cash and shore up its balance sheet.
The measures are intended to allow Sainsbury’s new chief executive, Mike    Coupe, to invest in lowering prices as well as expanding the company’s    online, convenience store and clothing businesses, which are performing well.
Sainsbury’s sales are falling for the first time in decade as Britain’s “big    four” grocery retailers fight shifts in shopping habits and the rise of the    discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Mr Coupe replaced Justin King in July and told the City last month that he was    conducting a strategic review. He will present the results of the review    alongside the company’s interim results, which the City expects to show a    12.5pc fall in underlying pre-tax profits to £350m.

Justin King defends his 10-year Sainsbury's legacy
06 Nov 2014
There has been speculation in the City that Sainsbury’s could launch a rights    issue to fund a new strategy, but the company is understood to have ruled    this out. Instead, it is likely to protect its balance sheet against falling    profits by cutting the dividend, potentially by as much as a third.
It is understood that Mr Coupe will also slash capital expenditure and    Sainsbury’s new store openings. Sales in large out-of-town supermarkets are    falling and Sainsbury’s wants to focus on opening smaller convenience stores.
John Kershaw, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said that Sainsbury’s might cut    the amount of space it opens by a third. He expected Sainsbury’s to open    less than 500,000 sq ft of new selling space in the next financial year,    down from 750,000 sq ft this year.
If the company mothballs sites earmarked for new supermarkets then it might be    forced to writedown the value of land on its balance sheet.
Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Sainsbury’s might cut capital    expenditure from just below £900m this year to between £550m and £600m in    future.
Mr Black said: “We expect Sainsbury’s to join Asda and Morrisons in becoming    more in touch with its customers through a re-allocation of resources from a    lower cost base with constrained capital outflows and potentially lower    dividend flows.
“For now, as is the case at Tesco, we suspect customers must take precedent    over shareholders and other stakeholders in the food system.”
Allan Leighton, the former boss of Asda, said the main problem facing    Britain’s grocery retailers was that they have too many stores.
Mr Leighton, who led a turnaround of Asda in the 1990s alongside Archie    Norman, said: “In the end, they have too many stores. I think there is a    structural thing, but there are also too many stores.”
Tesco’s market share peaked in 2007, but since then it has expanded its shop    space by the same area as the whole of Morrisons today.
Mr Leighton also questioned the product range in the big four supermarkets,    saying it had become too large and made it “harder to shop”.
He was speaking in an interview as chairman of Matalan, which is growing its    out-of-town business but has also opened its first high street store in    Cardiff.
Mr Leighton dismissed comments from the supermarket industry that shoppers    were turning against out-of-town shopping. He added: “Out of town is very    strong.”

after it announced the discoveryCairn Energy announces second Senegal oil find
This is Cairn's second discovery off the coast of Senegal in the past few weeks
Oil and gas explorer Cairn Energy has announced a second oil discovery off Senegal in West Africa.
The Edinburgh-based company described the find as "significant", adding that the oil was of high quality.
The discovery was made at its SNE-1 well in the Sangomar Deep block about 100km (62 miles) offshore.
According to Cairn's preliminary estimates, the well could could hold between 150 million and 670 million barrels of recoverable resources.
Last month, the company announced it had found oil at the nearby Fan-1 well.
Cairn has a 40% working interest in Sangomar and two other blocks in the area. Stakes are also held by ConocoPhillips (35%), FAR (15%) and Petrosen (10%).
Cairn chief executive Simon Thomson said: "This is a significant oil find for Cairn and Senegal and based on preliminary estimates is a commercial discovery and opens a new basin on the Atlantic Margin.
"On completion of  the SNE-1 well, the joint venture along with the authorities in Senegal will evaluate all of the information to understand how best to take forward these basin opening discoveries with an appraisal drilling programme in 2015.
"Cairn has additional prospects and leads that offer further exploration potential across this large acreage position in West Africa."

"Jean-Claude Juncker Needs to Go "Jean-Claude Juncker Needs to Go
71
By The Editors
Jean-Claude Juncker, the new president of the European Commission, was always a bad choice for the job, foisted on the bloc's 28 national governments by a European Parliament eager to expand its powers. It's becoming clear now just how poor a decision that appointment was.
Juncker was the prime minister of Luxembourg, a tiny nation with a population 1/17th the size of London's, for almost two decades. In that time, he oversaw the growth of a financial industry that became a tax center for at least 340 major global companies, not to mention investment funds with almost 3 trillion euros ($3.7 trillion) in net assets -- second only to the U.S.
Partly as a result of the Swiss-style bank secrecy rules and government-blessed tax avoidance schemes that helped draw so much capital, the people of Luxembourg have become the world's richest after Qatar. The tax arrangements, described in leaked documents provided by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, allegedly enabled multinationals, from Apple to Deutsche Bank, to reduce their tax liabilities on profits earned in other countries: The effective Luxembourg tax rates that resulted were as little as 0.25 percent. The countries where the money was made received nothing.
It's telling that these arrangements have long been shrouded in secrecy. (Only last month did Luxembourg's government drop its opposition to new EU rules on banking transparency.) Juncker, you could say, made his country rich by picking the pockets of other countries, including those of the European Union he is now mandated to serve.
The commission was already conducting an investigation of Luxembourg's tax arrangements. Juncker says he won't interfere -- but he won't recuse himself, either. Indeed, his spokesman says he is "serene" in the face of the revelations. He shouldn't be. At this point, he could best serve the European project by resigning.
Juncker's position as the head of the body investigating the tax practices he oversaw as prime minister is a clear conflict of interest. It's possible the commission will find nothing improper about Luxembourg's tax-avoidance paradise: The EU allows member governments wide latitude in taxing companies, so long as they don't favor some over others. But with Juncker in charge of the commission, any such exoneration will fail to command public confidence.
Just now, the importance of restoring trust in the EU would be hard to overstate. The union is struggling to emerge from the financial crisis and is increasingly seen as elitist, meddling and incapable of producing either fairness or growth. It cannot help this effort to have it overseen by a man who spent his career as a quintessential backroom dealer while building and running an international tax haven at other European countries' expense.
Granted, most of this was known -- or should have been -- before the appointment was made, and the European Parliament is much at fault for insisting on Juncker's appointment in the first place. But the tax revelations have put the issues before the public in a way that tests the EU's credibility afresh. Juncker has done nothing illegal and is in no immediate danger of being removed. Even so, the EU would be best served if he stepped down.

He was discussing new rules'Too big to fail' bank rules unveiled by global regulators
Mark Carney: "The system we've had up until now has been totally unfair"
Bankers should 'swear ethics oath'
New global rules to prevent banks that are "too big to fail" from being bailed out by taxpayers have been proposed.
The rules, created by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a global monitoring body, would require big banks to hold much more money against losses.
Mark Carney, FSB chairman and governor of the Bank of England, said the plans were a "watershed" moment.
He said it had been "totally unfair" for taxpayers to bail out banks after the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.
"The banks and their shareholders and their creditors got the benefit when things went well," he told the BBC.
"But when they went wrong the British public and subsequent generations picked up the bill - and that's going to end".
Mr Carney explained that the new system would ensure that bank shareholders, and lenders to banks such as bondholders, would become first in line to bear the brunt of future losses if banks could not pay out of their own resources.
"Instead of having the public, governments, [and] the taxpayer rescue banks when things go wrong; the creditors of banks, the big institutions that hold the banks' debt - not the depositors - will become the new shareholders of banks if banks make mistakes."
"Let's face it, the system we've had up until now has been totally unfair," he added.
Bigger cushion
Governments around the world spent hundreds of billions of pounds bailing out stricken banks during the financial crisis of 2007-08.
The banking industry strongly supports this work”
End Quote Anthony Browne BBA
At its peak in the UK alone, taxpayers' direct subsidy to banks stood at more than £1 trillion according to a recent report from the National Audit Office.
In the wake of the financial crisis, world leaders asked the FSB to come up with proposals to prevent similar bailouts from happening in the future.
The proposed new rules, which are up for consultation and should take effect in 2019, require "global systemically important banks" to hold a minimum amount of cash to ensure they will be able to survive big losses without turning to governments for help.
The capital set aside should be worth 15-20% of the bank's assets, the FSB said. That is a far bigger cushion against losses than is required by current banking rules.
The UK government still owns an 80% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland
The FSB hopes this stronger policy will prevent taxpayers from being forced to pay billions of pounds again to stop big banks from collapsing, in the event of another financial crisis.
Anthony Browne of the British Bankers' Association welcomed the proposals.
"The banking industry strongly supports this work, which is a really important step in ending 'too big to fail' and ensuring that never again will taxpayers have to step in to bail out banks," he said.
"We agree with the aims and objectives of the proposals for total loss absorbing capacity ('TLAC'), that there should be sufficient resources available to absorb losses in the event of bank failure and provide new capital to ensure critical economic functions can continue to be provided," he added.
Less disruption
"Agreement on proposals for a common international standard on total loss-absorbing capacity for [big banks] is a watershed in ending 'too big to fail' for banks," said Mr Carney.
"Once implemented, these agreements will play important roles in enabling globally systemic banks to be resolved without recourse to public subsidy and without disruption to the wider financial system."
According to the BBC's business editor Kamal Ahmed, analysts estimate the new capital requirements could cost €200bn (£157bn) for Europe's banks alone, with the cost for globally significant banks in the US, Japan and China likely to be much higher.
The FSB has published a list of 30 banks it regards as "systemically important", meaning their collapse could have a wider impact on global financial systems.
In the UK, the banks are Barclays, Standard Chartered, HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Lloyds Banking Group has been removed from the list as its potential impact on financial systems has declined in recent years.
The UK government spent around £65bn directly bailing out RBS and Lloyds during the crisis. The government still owns an 80% stake in RBS and 25% of Lloyds.
Analysis: Andrew Walker, economics correspondent, BBC News.
Lehman Brothers was the classic case of a financial institution that was too big to fail - or at least it probably was according to the previous Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.
Of course it DID fail, and the financial crisis entered a new and more dangerous phase after Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008. The immediate lesson that many policy makers drew - and this is contested - was that it should have been rescued.
And so they decided that other big financial firms would not fail and taxpayers' money was thrown at the banks around the world.
But there is another lesson drawn from the Lehman episode: that it would be far better to change the rules of finance to ensure that any bank could safely fail if it gets into serious difficulty no matter how big it is.
That's where the Financial Stability Board's new proposals come in.

Cairn Energy has announcedEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 0700                                                                                10 November 2014
 
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ("Cairn" or "the Company")
 
Second oil discovery offshore Senegal
 
 
Cairn is pleased to announce a discovery of high quality oil in the second well in the Senegal exploration programme.
 
The SNE-1 well is located in 1,100 metres (m) water depth and approximately 100 kilometres (km) offshore in the Sangomar Offshore block with a target depth of ~3,000 m and targeting the Shelf Edge Prospect.
 
Intermediate logging of the SNE-1 well has confirmed hydrocarbons in the Cretaceous clastics objective which is of similar age to oil bearing sands found approximately 24 km away in FAN-1.  
 
As operator, Cairn has now issued Notices of Discovery for the SNE-1 well and FAN-1 well to the Government of Senegal on behalf of the Joint Venture.
 
Initial analysis of the SNE-1 well indicates:
Ø 95m gross oil bearing column with a gas cap
Ø Excellent  reservoir sands  with net oil pay of 36m
Ø Oil of  32 degrees API  from samples of gas, oil and water recovered to surface
Ø Preliminary estimates of the Contingent Resource range from P90, 150 mmbbls, P50, 330 mmbbls and P10, 670 mmbbls recoverable
 
Further evaluation of this zone is continuing. The deeper target of karstified and fractured Lower Cretaceous shelf carbonates is yet to be reached. A further announcement will be issued once operations are completed on SNE-1.
 
The results of the FAN-1 well and the final analysis from the SNE-1 well will be used to decide optimal follow up locations to determine the extent of the hydrocarbon accumulations and additional activity which is targeted for 2015 onwards.
 
Cairn Energy Chief Executive Simon Thomson said:
"This is a significant oil find for Cairn and Senegal and based on preliminary estimates is a commercial discovery and opens a new basin on the Atlantic Margin.
 
On completion of  the SNE-1 well the joint venture along with the authorities in Senegal will evaluate all of the information to understand how best to take forward these basin opening discoveries with an appraisal drilling programme in 2015.
 
Cairn has additional prospects and leads that offer further exploration potential across this large acreage position in West Africa."
 
Cairn has a 40% Working Interest (WI) in three blocks offshore Senegal (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore and Rufisque) ConocoPhillips has 35% WI, FAR Ltd 15% WI and Petrosen, the national oil company of Senegal 10%.  The three blocks cover 7,490 km2.
 

Austerity cuts will need to be doubledGavyn Davies Britain will be squeezed
The level of cuts are nearly twice the £25bn estimate because that figure does not include planned cuts for two years out of the nine – 2015-16 and 2018-19 – and takes no account of the effect on departmental spending of rising numbers of pensioners and increases in pension payments. The Institute for Fiscal Studies last month criticised Mr Cameron for omitting the first and last year of the next parliament when calculating the size of the cuts to be made.
Even if the chancellor manages to cut welfare payments by another £12bn a year , as he promised in January, this would not be enough to prevent deeper overall cuts for government departments during the next parliament.
In the March Budget documents, data show that after taking account of inflation, the coalition cut annual day to day spending by government departments by £25bn between 2009-10 and 2014-15.
The Conservatives plan to increase the pace of these cuts over the next parliament, removing another £48bn from the total, reducing the total spent in departments from £312bn in 2014-15 to £264bn in 2018-19.
So far, the public sector has coped better than many expected. But with employees more restless about slow wage growth and the easier cuts already achieved, many experts think taxes are more likely to rise than fall after the next election to protect public services and keep the deficit falling.
The OBR and the Treasury have seen the FT’s findings but both declined to comment.

New global rules to prevent banksIs 'too big to fail' for banks really coming to an end?
 
Interviewing Alistair Darling in 2011, three years after the financial crisis during which he was chancellor, his most striking answer to me was not about the fear that Britain's economic system was on the point of collapse.
It wasn't even his worry that ATMs up and down the country might simply stop functioning.
Those answers were of course chilling. But they were symptoms of a wider disease.
Mr Darling's most striking answer was the "absolute astonishment" he felt when he asked Britain's largest banks to account for the risks contained in their businesses - and they were unable to come up with a coherent answer.
This total lack of knowledge - coupled with the hubris of profit-taking built on lax credit - went to the heart of the financial crisis.
Regulators appeared similarly non-plussed.
Such was the global complexity and lack of governance in the international financial system, when it came to rescuing the banks from having to eat their own sick, the UK government - and many other governments around the world - initially had no idea how large the bill would be.
And neither did the banks.
Taxpayer as guarantor
The only funding avenues large enough to contain such unquantifiable risks were those provided by central banks and the taxpayer.
The alternative was financial meltdown.
The numbers turned out to be astronomical. A National Audit Office report in August this year suggested the value of the UK government's total support for the financial system alone exceeded £1.1tn at its height.
Many tens of billions of pounds worth of capital was directly injected into failing banks and building societies.
The rest of that dizzying £1.1tn was the total value of liability insurance - the government guaranteeing banks' security as lender of last resort.
Put simply, the taxpayer had become the guarantor of the global financial system and the banks that are the essential plumbing of that system.
RBS was bailed out by the government after being deemed "too big to fail"
In direct capital the UK government (the taxpayer) ultimately had to find over £100bn. More than £66bn was used to rescue the Royal Bank of Scotland (still 80% owned by the government) and Lloyds Bank (still 25% owned by the government).
Of that, the sale of two chunks of Lloyds since the last election in 2010 has raised the princely sum of £7.4bn.
UK Asset Resolution, the state agency charged with handling the collapse of those other lead players in the the financial crisis, Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley, has so far paid back £12bn of a near-£50bn government loan.
What is clear is that the taxpayer is still a good deal out of pocket.
'Watershed moment'
Never again, went out the cry. At the G20 summit in London in 2009, world leaders from President Barack Obama to Gordon Brown demanded that the ugly canard of "too big to fail" - banks so large that their collapse would spark economic chaos - was brought to an end.
They demanded that the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a grouping of central bankers and financial policy makers, come up with a plan. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, is chairman of the FSB.
Today, after years of weighty policy documents and discussion, Mr Carney says that in the battle to end taxpayer exposure to failing financial institutions the world has reached a "watershed moment".
The FSB has published new standards on "loss absorbing capital" for all globally significant banks - major chunks of money banks will have to raise to ensure they have access to enough money to weather any future crisis without recourse to government coffers.
The FSB says banks will have to be able to access capital worth between 15% and 20% of their assets.
That is a very big number. Analysts suggest that the bill for this major amount of new capital could be as high as €200bn (£157bn) for Europe's banks alone.
Less lending?
The bill for American, Japanese and Chinese institutions which also make up the list of "globally significant banks" would be far higher.
As Roberto Nicastro, group general manager at UniCredit, told the Financial Times: "Banks would need to comply by further reducing lending activity."
And that could mean less money to support the economy.
So, is the taxpayer now protected?
The previous government was forced to spend billions bailing out banks to avoid financial collapse
Well, these new rules are unlikely to come into force until January 2019 at the earliest - so not yet.
And some economists are not convinced that in a systemic crisis any new regulations will be able to cope. In the teeth of an economic meltdown, could governments and regulators really organise the successful winding-down of failing institutions without the taxpayer once again footing the bill?
As we know, the best laid strategies of governments and regulators can come unstuck at the first contact with the enemy - events in the real world. The markets can gain a life of their own.
Mr Carney is sure banks are now safer than they were. And these new rules, which will be one of the main topics of debate at the G20 summit in Brisbane next week, will mean they are better prepared for the future.
Banks already have a lot more capital on their balance sheets to withstand global shocks.
"Living wills" - banks' emergency plans to be used in the event of a crisis - will eventually allow one part of a bank to be wound down in an orderly fashion without bringing down the whole operation.
That's the theory at least.
The UK's policy of "ring-fencing" - protecting the central retail bank from a collapse in investment banking activity - is also coming to help that process.
As is "bail-in" debt which means that investors carry the brunt of the cost of collapse. Rather than being paid back, they will be obliged to take an equity stake in the failing institution.
Central banks hope that will concentrate investors' minds on the stability of the bank rather than the short-term returns an institution can generate.
The end of "too big to fail"? Not yet. A major step on the journey? Mr Carney would like us to believe so.
 

Chinese President Xi Jinping is hostingChina manufacturing growth slows
The risks facing China's economy are not "scary", President Xi Jinping has told global business leaders.
In a speech to chief executives ahead of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit he sought to dispel concerns about the economy.
"There are indeed risks (to growth), but it's not so scary," he said.
China also announced a deepening of its energy ties with Russia, with the countries agreeing a major new gas pipeline linking the two nations.
Apec is expected to be the venue to announce several international deals among Asia-Pacific nations. On Sunday, Mr Xi pledged $40bn to improve trade links with other nations in the region.
The world's second largest economy has had a tough year, held back by a contraction in the property market, slower consumer demand, and unsteady exports.
But Mr Xi pointed out that even if China's economy were to grow by 7%, that would still rank it at the forefront of the world's economies.
He said the economy remained "stable".
Official figures released on Saturday showed that growth in exports and imports slowed in October. Annual growth slowed to 7.3% in the third quarter of 2014, the weakest since the height of the global financial crisis.
In a bid to bolster growth, the government has accelerated spending on infrastructure projects, while the central bank has injected money into bank to improve credit supply and cut mortgage rates for some homebuyers.
Mr Xi said China's economic and social reforms would take time to have an impact, but were irreversible.
'Positive results'
"These reforms are gradually being put into effect project by project. Once the bow is drawn, the arrow cannot be put back in the quiver; we will resolutely deepen reform," he said.
The two-day Apec summit opens on Monday. After a meeting on Sunday with several Asian leaders, Mr Xi promised $40bn to help countries to improve infrastructure and trade.
"Efforts by a single or several countries are far from adequate," said Mr Xi. "Only by building extensive partnerships where all will think and work in unison can we expect to achieve positive results."
Last month, China and 20 other Asian governments launched a $50bn bank to finance infrastructure in the region, despite US objections that it was an unneeded duplication of work by the World Bank.
Gas deal
On Sunday, Mr Xi and President Vladimir Putin strengthened their energy links when the two signed a memorandum of understanding on the so-called "western gas route" from Russia to China.
Russia has been shifting its focus to Asian markets after Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis targeted a number of Russian banks and energy companies by limiting their access to funding.
In May, Russia's state-controlled gas giant Gazprom agreed to ship 38bn cubic metres of gas to China in a deal worth $400bn, from eastern Siberia.
Under Sunday's agreement, the two countries said they would explore plans to transport gas via fields in western Siberia.
As part of the deal, China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development is taking a 10% in Vancorneft, part of another Russian energy giant, Rosneft.

RBL Bank Plans to Launch IPO in Three Quarters

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: RBL Bank, formerly known as Ratnakar Bank, plans to raise funds through an initial public offering (IPO) which will hit the market in the next 8-9 months.
"We are preparing ourselves for the IPO and it may hit market in 8-9 months. It would not happen this fiscal but next calender year," RBL Bank managing director Vishwavir Ahuja told PTI.
The quantum of offer has not been finalised by the bank's, he said, adding that the decision will be taken in the next few months after taking into account various factors including Basel III requirement.
The bank has been able to build scale and size in the last four years so that it gets right valuation, he said.
Capital is required for the next phase of operation as the bank has already done with transformation stage, he said, adding it has got high technology and risk management system.
The bank services more than 6 lakh customers and has a total business size of over Rs 26,000 crore. As of September total deposits were Rs 12,000 crore while advances stood at Rs 14,000 crore.
The bank posted a net profit of Rs 87 crore for the six months to September 2014, while for the entire 2013-14, the profit stood at Rs 93 crore.
"So we have almost matched the net profit of the last fiscal in the first two quarters of the current financial
year," he said.
It got capital support of about Rs 1,500 crore from global and domestic investors in the last three years.
RBL Bank had raised Rs 328 crore from a group of global investors, including CDC Group and Asia Capital and Advisors in April 2014.
Existing investors including International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Gaja Capital also participated in the capital infusion.
Last year, the bank acquired some assets of Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), including the UK bank's mortgages, credit card and loan-against-property portfolios.

November 10, 2014:  
The Engineers India stock has dropped 11 per cent so far today after the company reported weak results in the quarter ended September 2014. Compared to the same period last year, the company’s net sales for this period fell by 16 per cent to Rs 391 crore and net profits dipped by 47 per cent to Rs 59 crore.
The company which provides EPC, design and project management services witnessed poor performance both in its consultancy division, which brings 50-60 per cent of revenues, and turnkey projects division.
Although it recorded a loss of Rs 20 crore in the turnkey projects segment, it is less of a concern as revenues in this segment is generally lumpy and profits don’t accrue uniformly.
But what is more worrying is the continued weak performance in the high-margin consultancy division in the last few quarters. From about 34 per cent in the September 2013 quarter, operating profit margin for the consultancy division has dwindled to 18.6 per cent in this year.
Thanks to market preference for cyclical stocks during the rally of the last one year, the stock touched its 52 week high of Rs 331 in early July 2014. Since then though, it has been on a losing streak, giving up about 27 per cent.
Investors can expect profitability to pick-up once economic growth improves and industrial capital spends rise.

New Delhi, Nov 10:  
The state owned helicopter operator, Pawan Hans Helicopter Limited (PHHL) and airport operator, Airports Authority of India (AAI) are to be listed on the stock exchange, Minister for Civil Aviation Ashok Gajapathi Raju, said on Monday. Set up in 1985, PHHL is currently the largest helicopter operator in the country.
A senior Ministry official told newspersons that no time frame has yet been fixed by when the two entities will be listed or what percentage of the Government’s holdings in the companies will be shed.
“It will be easier to list PHHL because it is already a registered company. It could take up to six months for listing PHHL. We will work with the Department of Disinvestment as it is the nodal Ministry for divesting stake in PSUs. Mopping up funds is not the prime objective of the exercise in both the entities. It will also help bring about greater professionalism in the boards of the two entities,” the official who declined to be identified said.
Briefing newspersons after releasing the draft Civil Aviation policy, the Minister also said that an expert committee will be set up to draw up a future road map for Air India which will help it achieve its full potential.
International hubs
The draft policy, which is now available in the public domain for greater participation from stakeholders, proposes enhancing regional air connectivity, developing six major metro airports as international hubs, creating more airports through PPP mode, rationalising jet fuel costs, promoting air cargo, starting Maintenance Repair and Overhaul services and helicopter operations apart from stressing on improving passenger facilitation.
The Minister expressed the hope that the draft policy will be finalised by January next year.

The Minister also hinted at the eventual divestment of Air India pointing out that there were several suggestions made by different sections including some saying that privatisation is a solution while others felt it should remain a public entity.
Pointing out that there were several issues which had been mentioned in the draft policy but for which the Cabinet will not will be required including doing away with the five year and 20 aircraft rule for allowing domestic airlines to start international operations. The Minister added that the 5/20 rule did not make sense.

Supreme Court paves way for female make-up artists to work in BollywoodEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Bringing cheer to female make-up artists, the Supreme Court today put an end to a 59-year old practice in Bollywood that puts restrictions on them from pursuing the profession in the film industry, saying such “shocking” discrimination on the basis of gender is violative of constitutional values.
Holding that harassment of women in the 21st century is “inconceivable and impermissible”, the apex court struck down the provision putting restriction on women make-up artists and hair dressers in the film industry.
A bench of justices Dipak Misra and U U Lalit also held as unconstitutional a provision that makes mandatory to have a five year domicile of Maharashtra for becoming a registered make-up artist and hair-dresser in Bollywood.
It said that there is no “rationality’ in such kind of discrimination and directed the Cine Costume and Make-up Artist Association (Mumbai) to delete the provisions within 10 days.
The court passed the order on a PIL filed by one Charu Khurana and other women make-up artists who alleged that female artists are not allowed to be a member of the association and one cannot work in the industry without being registered with the association.
“As per the by-laws of all these unions and federations, make-up artists, hair dressers, etc, are required to register themselves with their respective union like the Cine Costume and Make-up Artist and Hair Dresser Association (CCMAA).
“Only a member of these associations is allowed to work as a make-up artist in the production unit in the cine industry. These federations and affiliated unions ensure that no non-member works in the production unit,” she had contended.
She submitted that such provisions are wholly discriminatory practice depriving female make-up artists of their fundamental rights to work and earn their livelihood guaranteed by the Constitution.
Khurana qualified from the Cinema Make-up School, California, but her application for membership was rejected by the CCMAA in 2009 because she is a woman.

AAI  Pawan Hans to be listed; Air India privatisation not now: GovtEditorial: Reliance Industries goes to Mexico
Terming UPA’s aviation policy as “opaque”, government today brought in a fresh draft recommending listing of state-run Airports Authority of India and chopper firm Pawan Hans on stock exchanges and steps to beef up Air India operations, hinting at its stake sale too.
Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju unveiled the draft civil aviation policy which also proposes to enhance regional air connectivity, develop six major metro airports as international hubs, create more airports through PPP mode, rationalise jet fuel cost, promote air cargo, MRO and helicopter operations and improve passenger facilitation.
The rule, which allows an Indian airline to fly abroad only after they have flown domestic for five years and have a 20-aircraft fleet, would also be reviewed, he said.
The draft would now be open for wider consultation with all stakeholders, with the Minister saying he hoped to finalise and implement it by January next year.
“If a policy existed (during UPA rule), it was opaque. We want to develop a transparent policy because opaqueness leads itself to allegations. This government wants to work in a transparent manner,” Raju said in response to questions.
On the proposal to list mini ratna AAI and Pawan Hans Helicopters Limited (PHHL) on stock exchanges to “improve transparency and efficiency”, he said, “AAI will be corporatised, followed by listing in the stock exchanges in order to improve efficiency and transparency. Listing of PHHL would also be undertaken with the same objective.”
“PHHL’s listing straightaway might make sense. For AAI also, that is possible,” the Minister said.
A senior official later said no time frame has yet been fixed for by when the two entities would be listed or what percentage of government holding would be divested in them.
Regarding privatisation of Air India, he said this was a suggestion made by “certain sections. While some say privatisation is a solution, others say it should remain with the public sector. Another section says the airline should be managed professionally by professional bodies.”
“Why should we close our options? Let us take a conscious decision,” he said.
Asked whether Air India could also be listed in the stock market like AAI and PHHL, the Minister said, “If it could get listed, I would be the happiest person”.
Observing that an “in-house” Experts Committee would be set up soon to develop “a future roadmap” for Air India, he said,
“It is in the country’s interest that it cruises smoothly. All these suggestions have emerged. We don’t want to open a pandora’s box. We will have to take a conscious decision as it is a delicate matter.”
Later, the Civil Aviation Ministry official, who did not wish to be named, said any decision on stake sale or professional management would be taken only after the experts group gives its recommendations and then “we will see what is the best alternative or the best way forward.”
On AAI and PHHL, he said it would be easier to list PHHL because it is already a registered company.
“It could take up to six months for listing PHHL. We will work with the Department of Disinvestment, as it is the nodal Ministry for divesting stake in PSUs. Mopping up funds is not the prime objective of the exercise in both the entities. It will also help bring about greater professionalism in the boards of the two entities,” the official said.
To questions on whether the rule of five years of domestic flying and 20-plane fleet to allow Indian carriers to fly abroad would be scrapped, the Minister indicated doing away with it, saying rules which check the growth of aviation would go. “To my mind, it doesn’t make sense … we may throw the bathwater and keep the baby”.
On high taxes on jet fuel, Raju said the Centre has been requesting states to lower the taxes as fuel costs are close to 40-45 per cent of an airline’s total operational cost.
“When global petroleum prices are coming down, we will try to get a strategy in place to pass on that benefit,” he said.

Shiv Sena makes it clear  will oppose BJP in Maharashtra houseShiv Sena sits in opposition in Maharashtra
Dharmendra Jore , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, November 10, 2014
First Published: 12:27 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:27 IST(11/11/2014)
As the new Maharashtra assembly held its first sitting on Monday, the Shiv Sena staked claim to the post of leader of the opposition even as it continued to negotiate with the BJP on joining the government.
 
The BJP confirmed talks were on but reiterated that the Sena should accept what was offered and stop demanding a certain number of ministerial berths or portfolios.
CM Devendra Fadnavis arrives for the three-day special session of Maharashtra assembly in Mumbai. (PTI photo)
Undermining the seriousness of the legislature’s procedures in its bid to pressure the BJP, the Sena nominated Eknath Shinde for leader of the Opposition. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray justified it saying he sent the letter to the legislature secretary because the Congress was rushing to grab the post.
“The talks (with BJP) are going on and on and what if it doesn’t work? Then we won’t get either (neither power nor post of opposition leader),” Thackeray said at a party meet on Monday evening. If the talks with BJP fail the Sena would perform the role of a strong opposition party, he added.
The Sena expects the BJP to concede its demands —10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister — to vote in favour of the trust vote on November 12. The BJP is 23 votes short of a majority.
The two parties split just before the assembly elections after 25 years together. Now, both have taken strong positions on power-sharing, but are still talking. A section of BJP leaders would prefer to take the Sena along as they believe accepting outside support of the NCP would be politically damaging.
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis himself would prefer to go with `natural ally’ Sena, but wants Thackeray to make `reasonable’ demands since the BJP already has 121 seats.
The Sena leadership, while slowly reconciling itself to sitting in the opposition, is wary the BJP could poach some of its 63 MLAs. It is also worried it could lose control of the Mumbai civic body, where it is in alliance with the BJP.
On Sunday, Thackeray asked Anil Desai, the Sena’s Rajya Sabha member who was to join Narendra Modi’s ministry, to boycott the swearing in. Later, he asked the BJP to clarify its stand on seeking the NCP’s support from outside.
On Monday, the Sena staked claim to the post of leader of the opposition a couple of hours after NCP chief Sharad Pawar reiterated his resolve to support the BJP from outside and ridiculed Thackeray for making remarks against him a day before.   
Armed with a plan B for winning the trust vote – support from the NCP and 14 to 17 MLAs from small parties and Independents -- the BJP was still hopeful of patching up with the Sena. It prefers the Sena because of their common ideology and experience of working together. The BJP was unwilling to go with NCP because of the party’s tainted track record.
The BJP can expect find the going tough if it leans on the NCP. Pawar gave it a veiled warning on Monday when he said that the BJP should reopen and inquire into all the cases (of corruption and irregularities) against his leaders. 
A confident Fadnavis, who said earlier his mandate (from the party high command) was to govern and not to save the government, put on a brave face by telling party colleagues that he would sail through in any case.
When asked, Fadnavis refused to comment on the matter.
A senior BJP leader told HT that the doors were kept open for the Sena even after the day’s development. “Talks with the Sena are on through several channels. We are still hopeful of the Sena withdrawing the claim [to the post of leader of the opposition] if we strike a suitable deal.”

Human resources director Allyson Russell (pictured) said most of the 300 new staff members will be recruited from Hungary after generating little interest from locals
The £35million factory, in Northampton, is due to open in early 2016. 
Mrs Russell said low unemployment meant few locals could be found to fill vacancies, although there are around 8,000 jobless in the town, a rate of 6.8 per cent – the national average – while in nearby Corby it is 9.5 per cent and Luton 8.7 per cent.
 In Hungary, the average wage is little more than £7,000. Even if workers coming here were on the minimum wage, they would earn almost double that – £13,520 a year.
And they would have their wages topped up with tax credits – seen as a major attraction for EU migrants – and housing benefit.
These mean a migrant with no dependants on the minimum wage has their net income of about £184 a week boosted to £254, studies have suggested.
For those with a partner and two children, that rockets to £543 a week, equivalent to a salary of more than £28,000.
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has claimed that the last Labour Government’s ‘open-door’ policy led to a huge influx of low-skilled migrant workers while its welfare system disincentivised Britons to work.
Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell said: ‘This highlights why we have so many people coming here – because jobs are available and not everyone wants to take those jobs. 
Greencore staff hard at work in one of their factories - but bosses are struggling to find people who want to work in its new £35 million factory in Northampton, which is due to open in 2016
Greencore's Food to Go business is one of the world's leading manufacturers of pre-packed sandwiches
People on benefits here should be willing to take any job.’
Greencore is not the only company to go to Eastern Europe in search of workers. 
Earlier this year, the Mail found British companies had placed almost 8,000 job adverts trying to recruit Romanian nurses, taxi drivers and hotel staff.

Will highlight issue of black money at G20 summit: ModiAbbott
("A key issue for me would…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the importance of global cooperation against black money will be a "key issue" he will highlight at the upcoming G20 summit in Brisbane, as he embarks on a three-nation visit from tomorrow.
Seeking to inject momentum in the country's 'Act East' policy, Modi will undertake the 10-day visit of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji to attend key multilateral summits and undertake bilateral meetings during which India is expected to push for steps to create more jobs and improve world economy.
"A key issue for me would be to highlight the importance of international cooperation against black money," Modi said in a pre-departure statement.
As India attempts to unearth black money stashed abroad, Modi is expected to renew the country's commitment to a global response to deal with cross border tax avoidance and evasion.
In the statement, Modi said during the course of the ASEAN-India and East Asian summits in Myanmar Capital Nay Pyi and at the G20 summit in Brisbane and bilateral visits to Australia and Fiji he will meet over 40 leaders from countries representing Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and Pacific Region.
At the annual summit of the Group of 20 of the world's biggest developed and emerging economies, Modi said he intends to dicuss how it can accelerate creation of next generation infrastructure, which also includes digital infrastructure, and ensure access to clean and affordable energy. The two-day summit will be held from November 15. G20 accounts for 85 per cent of the world's economic output.
During his foreign tour, Modi will undertake a bilateral visit for talks with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott in Canberra after the G20 summit.
Modi will be the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986.
"While we have much in common with Australia, our political, strategic and economic relations have been below potential.
A closer strategic partnership with Australia will support India's economic goals; promote our security interests, including maritime security; and, reinforce our efforts to foster a climate of peace and stability in our extended continental and maritime neighbourhood," he said referring to his four-city, three-day visit from November 16 that covers Melbourne and Sydney besides Melbourne and Canberra.

Indian Inc likely to hire 23% more next year: Report
PTI Nov 10, 2014, 08.41PM IST
(Hospitality and travel…)
MUMBAI: Indian Inc expects a 23 per cent increase in hiring next year, according to a survey.
"Indian employers across the major sectors forecast an overall increase of 23 per cent in hiring outlook for the next year," said 'India Skills Report 2015', released at the Confederation of Indian Industries' (CII) Sixth Global Summit On Skill Development.
The report is jointly prepared by global talent assessment company Wheebox, India's platform based multi-process HR outsourcing and recruitment company PeopleStrong and the world's largest professional online network Linkedin and CII.
Hospitality and travel sectors lead the way with an increase of over 50 per cent in recruitment numbers in the coming year, the study said.
These two sectors are closely followed by banking, financial services and insurance and core segments.
The lowest growth in hiring is expected in manufacturing, telecom and pharma which seem to be directly correlated with the growth that companies in these sectors target, the study said.
It also said New Delhi and Mumbai are among the most preferred locations to operate.
Apart from these two, Karnataka and Gujarat seem to rank higher as preferred locations, the study said.
These two states are amongst the few states reforming policies to make it easier for corporates to set up operations, the report said.
The report also found that there is an overall trend towards young candidates, with about 72 per cent employers preferring to hire candidates aged 30 years and below.
The preference for a young workforce is good news for a country like India where 60 per cent of the population would be of working age by 2020, the report said.
On gender diversity, the report said that though there has been a significant increase in the number of women hired, it still appears to be a man's world.
While last year, the ratio was 76:24, this year it has been reduced to 68:32, the report said.
Certain sectors like BFSI, BPO and hospitality did see a slight drop in the percentage of women, there is a clear hope that with special efforts, this number would definitely get better, it said.

HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 10, 2014

In the first cabinet expansion exercise of the Narendra Modi government, 21 ministers were inducted into the council of ministers on Sunday. Four ministers were allotted cabinet rank, whereas three took charge as ministers of state (independent charge). The remaining 14 took oath as MoS.
While former Goa chief minister Manohar Parikkar has been allotted the defence ministry, JP Nadda, who has been a long-time organisation man, is the new health minister. The incumbent Harshvardhan has been given science and technology and earth sciences. Birender Singh, who had shifted to the BJP from the Congress ahead of the Haryana elections, is the new rural development minister.
Here are the profiles of the newly sworn-in ministers and their portfolios.
Cabinet ministers
Manohar Parrikar, 58 (Defence): A metallurgical engineering graduate from IIT-Bombay, he has a reputation for honesty and simplicity. He was praised as the 'Common Man's CM' for flying without security or entourage and carrying his own briefcase.
Suresh Prabhu, 61 (Railways): He was the chemical and fertilizer minister in the first National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. Prabhu, who later became the environment minister during the NDA regime, is known as a performer. A former Shiv Sena member, he is part of international bodies on sustainable growth and climate change. A law degree holder with doctorate in climate change from Germany, Prabhu is a strong votary of a balance between economic development and environment protection. His website says he has "uncommon whiff of much needed fresh air" who introduced amendment to the Patents Act that gave fillip to the Indian generic medicine industry.
Jagat Prakash Nadda, 54 (Health and family welfare): Brought up in Patna, Nadda was one of the youngest legislators to be elected to Himachal assembly. The veteran politician who earned recognition as a Himachal Pradesh leader lost the race for BJP's presidency to Amit Shah after the Lok Sabha elections. His big leap into politics started during Emergency in 1977 as an Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad activist. Nadda is known to maintain a low profile and claims to be a disciplined solider of the RSS.
Birender Singh, 68 (Rural development): A long-time Congress man, he joined the BJP before assembly elections in Haryana this August to protest against the grand old party not agreeing to the sacking of then chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. In his long political career, he had been Congress in-charge for many states such as Uttarakhand and Himachal, and was the chairperson of many parliamentary standing committees. He had joined the BJP apparently on the assurance that he would get a Union cabinet berth.
Ministers of State (independent charge)
Bandaru Dattatreya, 67 (Labour and employment): A minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, he was president of the BJP in newly created state of Telangana. An RSS activist, he was the founding member of the party in residual Andhra Pradesh and was chairperson of several parliamentary standing committees. He had been elected to the Lower House for the first time from Secunderabad in the 10th Lok Sabha.
Rajiv Pratap Rudy, 52 (Skill development and entrepreneurship, parliamentary affairs): At an age of 38, he was inducted as one of the youngest ministers in the Vajpayee government in 2000. He was a minister of state and elevated with independent charge three years later and given the important portfolio of civil aviation. An alumni of Panjab University and MP from Bihar, he was in-charge of the party in Maharashtra, where the BJP emerged as the largest single party in the recently concluded assembly elections.
Dr Mahesh Sharma, 55 (Culture, tourism, civil aviation): A doctor by profession, Sharma is an MP from Gautam Budh Nagar, Noida. He runs several charitable hospitals and clinics in the National Capital Territory. Sharma has been a long associate of the RSS and is former Noida MLA from the BJP.
Ministers of State
Hansraj Ahir, 59 (Chemicals and fertilizers): He is a member of Lok Sabha from Chandrapur in Maharashtra and was instrumental in exposing the coal scam. It was on his letter to the Central Vigilance Commission that led to a CBI inquiry into the coal scam. He was face of the BJP in exposing the coal scam during the UPA regime and obtained relevant documents to embarrass the Manmohan Singh led government. An active parliamentarian, Ahir had introduced a large number of private member bills in over 15 years as an MP.
Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, 57 (Minority affairs, parliamentary affairs): A vocal BJP spokesperson and former MoS for information and broadcasting, Naqvi has been the Muslim face of the party for long. Born in 1957 in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, Naqvi contested his first election on now-defunct Janata Party ticket in 1980 and was one of the ministers in Vajpayee's cabinet in 1998. Known for freely airing his views, he created a flutter by saying that now even Dawood Ibrahim can join the BJP on decision to induct Bihar Janata Dal (United) leader Shabbir Ali during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
Giriraj Singh, 54 (Micro, small and medium enterprises): His emergence on the national political scene had been rather dramatic. During Lok Sabha polls, the Election Commission debarred him from campaigning after he asked all Modi detractors to go to Pakistan. And after the polls, he was in the news for about Rs. 1.14 crore stolen from his house in Patna. A firebrand Bhumihar leader, he was a minister in the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) and BJP alliance government, and has influence over vast pockets in southern Bihar, which goes to polls in 2015, and election-bound Jharkhand.
Ram Kripal Yadav, 57 (Drinking water and sanitation): A former Lalu Prasad supporter, he quit the party after being denied a ticket from Pataliputra. He contested on a BJP ticket and defeated Prasad's daughter Misa Bharti. A former deputy mayor of Patna and a law graduate, Yadav is known for his rhetoric in both the houses of Parliament, where he had represented Prasad's RJD. An aggressive campaigner with vote base among backwards in Bihar, his induction will strengthen the BJP's campaign to form the next government in the state in 2015 assembly elections.
Babul Supriyo, 44 (Urban development, housing and urban poverty alleviation): It was on a flight with Baba Ramdev as co-passenger that singer Babul Supriyo's political baptism took place. Ramdev reportedly asked Supriyo if he was interested in politics and contesting an election. The singer's induction gives West Bengal representation in the Modi cabinet. Supriyo's thumping victory from Asansol on a BJP ticket was a huge boost for the party. Born and raised in Uttarpara, he is the musical heir to a prestigious musical family of Bengal and the grandson of the noted composer, Banikantha NC Baral.
Jayant Sinha 51 (Finance): The 51-year-old Hazaribagh MP, Jayant Sinha, is a former corporate honcho with wide experience in corporate governance and strategy consulting. He will be an asset in an economic ministry. Son of former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, he spent 12 years with McKinsey & Company as a partner apart from serving as president of Internet Business Capital Corp and in consulting positions at Stone & Webster and Synergic Resources Corporation, US. Sinha is an MBA with distinction from the Harvard Business School; has an MS in Energy Management and Policy from the University of Pennsylvania; and a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering with distinction from the IIT, Delhi.
Sanwar Lal Jat, 59 (Water resources, river development and ganga rejuvenation): Sanwar Lal Jat had defeated Congress heavyweight Sachin Pilot from the Ajmer seat. His elevation balances the Jat-Rajput equation in Rajasthan. Jat is a powerful leader in the area and had quit the Vasundhara Raje Cabinet to contest the elections.
Mohan Kundariya, 63 (Agricultutre): He is an influential leader from Patel community and MP from Rajkot. Powerful politician with strong roots in the Saurashtra region, he had served as minister in the Modi cabinet in Gujarat.
Ram Shankar, 50 (Human resource development): A second-time Lok Sabha member from Agra, Shankar is an academician by profession and had been part of the party's anti-corruption campaign. He was also part of several parliamentary committees in the 15th Lok Sabha. He was sworn in as minister of state.
Vijay Sampla, 53 (Social justice and empowerment): It is a rag to riches story for him. A Dalit employed as plumber in Saudi Arabia after his matriculation, he returned to Punjab a few decades ago and joined politics. A successful businessman now, Sampla was elected to Lok Sabha from Hoshiarpur in Punjab and inducted into the cabinet for the first time.
YS Chowdhary, 53 (Science and technology, earth science): It has been a meteoric rise for the TDP leader. A businessman from Hyderabad, he was unanimously elected to Rajya Sabha in 2010. His brief bio-data on the Rajya Sabha website says he is an engineer by profession but was hand-picked for the election to Upper House by TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu.
Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, 60 (Home affairs): He is an MP from Banaskantha in Gujarat. He has been a BJP member since 1988, and had been the vice-president of Gujarat state unit from 2005 to 2010.
Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, 47 (Food processing industries): The lone woman induction in the Modi cabinet, Jyoti is an MP from Fatepur who defeated RLD's Amar Singh. She was in news recently after a bid on her life and well-known RSS leanings.

Debating King v. Burwell (with comments on Krugman)By Jonathan H. Adler November 10
Friday’s welcome -but- unexpected grant in King v. Burwell has already produced a flurry of commentary — some of it substantive, some not so much.
In the former category, SCOTUSBlog is hosting a mini-symposium on the case, my own contribution to which is here . (Regular VC readers will recognize many of the arguments.) Other contributors, thus far, include Nicholas Bagley and Abbe Gluck, two of the more thoughtful folks on other side of this case.  More will follow.  SCOTUSBlog will post links to the contributions, and relevant case materials,  here . (For a more comprehensive collection of King-related materials, see here and here .)
The debates are not only online. Tuesday I’ll be in New Haven to debate Professor Gluck at Yale Law School. Linda Greenhouse will moderate. For those unable to attend, here’s my October debate with Professor Bagley and my panel at the recent Cato forum at which Jim Blumstein and I crossed swords with Brianne Gorod and David Ziff.
One problem with debating and discussing the issue in King is that many folks (pundits, bloggers, etc.) have very strong views about questions they clearly do not understand. Things that seem obvious to one side or the other are often wrong or legally irrelevant. People that are otherwise expert on health care policy become enamored with argument s that don’t actually prove their case  because they are not responsive to the other side’s claims.  For instance, those Gruber videos are fun, and make a point , but they don’t prove the plaintiffs are correct on the merits.  Professor Ziff, with whom I disagree on the underlying issue, had a thoughtful post on this problem that advocates on both sides would do well to consider.
For an example of someone making arguments that are not nearly as strong as he thinks they are it would be hard to do better than Paul Krugman’s most recent column .  In this piece, Krugman makes basic mistakes — e.g. the plaintiffs’ case is not based on just “one clause” in the statute — and insists that only an “incredibly hostile reader” could read “established by the State” to mean, well, “established by the State.” This would be news to the folks at CRS  or those at the IRS who initially drafted implementing regs that tracked the statutory language. Even some folks on Krugman’s side have conceded that the statute’s words “clearly say” credits are only authorized in state-established exchanges, even if they believe this is “what Congress clearly did not mean.”
The one appellate court to agree with Krugman conceded “there is a certain sense to the plaintiffs’ position.”  Yet, according to Krugman, only those who are “hostile” and “corrupt” could reach such a conclusion.  In ruling for the government, the panel majority in King concluded  “the defendants have the stronger position, although only slightly,” and ultimately held for the government because it found the statutory language sufficiently ambiguous to support the IRS rule as a reasonable interpretation. I find the Fourth Circuit’s opinion reasonable but unconvincing. See this post for some of the reasons why the Fourth Circuit was wrong (or see my co-authored amicus brief for the Halbig en banc).  There are serious arguments here on both sides, but Krugman can’t see them.
According to Krugman, the claim in King is based upon an “obvious typo.” In other words, Krugman thinks this is a case of sloppy legislative drafting that should be corrected by the courts.  This is a popular argument among pundits, but it’s not made by the government or more knowledgeable legal experts — and for good reason: It’s a weak argument. In order for the government to prevail in arguing that a statute does not mean what the plain text says — that, there is a “scrivener’s error” or a statute would produce “absurd results” — the government has to show that there is no conceivable possibility that the text was deliberate.  For reasons I explained years ago ( literally ) this argument fails, as most thoughtful commentators on the other side have conceded.  The government’s strongest argument is not that there is a typo, but that the entire statute, construed as a whole, allows for what the IRS did, even if only because the text is sufficiently ambiguous to allow for the IRS’s interpretation.
Rhetorically, the column is also a bit unhinged.  Krugman writes that any judge who adopts a traditional textualist approach to interpretation and thus sides with the plaintiffs is “corrupt.” So Judge Thomas Griffith of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, who when nominated was praised for his fair-mindedness and moderate temperament by folks on both sides of the aisle, is tarred with this brush because he found the plaintiffs arguments convincing and wrote the D.C. Circuit’s Halbig opinion. Never mind that he applied the same interpretive method he had used in prior cases. In  Sierra Club v. EPA , for instance, Griffith ruled against the Bush EPA because it failed to adhere to the text of the Clean Air Act.  In Sierra Club, as in many statutory cases, one word (“each”) made all the difference.
Krugman’s column illustrates contemporary punditry can distort what is actually a serious legal debate (much like how some conservative commentary distorts the serious arguments in favor of the president’s authority to act unilaterally on immigration).  The arguments that make for good op-eds don’t necessarily make for good legal advocacy.  If Krugman wants to actually advance his side’s argument (rather than just vent his spleen), he should really read the Ziff post above  and take legal argument seriously. Alternatively, he could stick to subjects upon which he’s actually an expert.

Miracle patient in Florida survives after 45 minutes without a pulseFor 45 minutes, 40-year old Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro had no pulse. Now she is alive and healthy with no brain damage. (Photodisc)
They are calling it "a miracle."
Doctors at Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida have no way to explain how 40-year-old Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro survived after spending 45 minutes without a pulse and enduring three hours of attempts to bring her back from near-death on Sept. 23.
Graupera-Cassimiro, now a mother of two, had just come out of a cesarean section procedure to deliver her new daughter. Then suddenly, she went from chattering with her family to struggling for her life, according to the Sun Sentinel. 
She was suffering from a rare complication called an amniotic fluid embolism, in which the fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb enters the mother's blood stream. The condition can cause life-threatening blood clots. 
As Graupera-Cassimiro slipped into unconsciousness, doctors and nurses rushed back to her room in a desperate effort to save her life.
After more than two hours later, her heart stopped.
Doctors and nurses began chest compression that would continue for 45 minutes. They took turns to avoid exhaustion and used electric shock paddles. But nothing worked.
Finally, they decided to call her family into the room to say their goodbyes.
"Once we say that's it, that's it," said anesthesiologist Dr. Anthony Salvadore, according to the Sun Sentinel.
Her family left the room to pray. And doctors were on the verge of declaring her dead when suddenly there was a blip her heart monitor. That was followed by another and another.
Nurse Claire Hansen came out of the operating room with a shocking message, the Sun Sentinel reported.
"Keep praying," she told Graupera-Cassimiro's assembled family, "because her heart just started."
"She essentially spontaneously resuscitated when we were about to call the time of death," said Thomas Chakurda, the hospital spokesman told the Associated Press. 
A day later, Graupera-Cassimiro was taken off of life support. And today she is "the picture of health," Chakurda said.
On Tuesday, she and her newborn baby returned to the hospital to thank nurses and doctors for their life-saving efforts.
"Had you guys maybe stopped before the 45 minutes of compressions -- I mean, I don't know. All I know is that I'm grateful to be here," Graupera-Cassimiro she told them, according to the Sun Sentinel. "I don't know why I was given this opportunity, but I'm very grateful for it."
Childbirth complications like Graupera-Cassimiro's are rare -- it is estimated that between 1 and 12 cases of amniotic embolism occur with every 100,000 births, according to the Mayo Clinic. Scientists don't fully understand why complications occur for some mothers but not for others, but pregnancy at an older age, c-sections, and medically induced labor may increase the risk to some women.
But not only did Graupera-Cassimiro survive, but she suffered no brain damage or physical injuries from efforts to revive her.
"There's very few things in medicine that I've seen, working in the trauma center myself and doing all the things that I do, that really were either unexplainable or miraculous," said the president of the hospital's medical staff, Dr. Anthony Dardano, according to the Sun Sentinel. "And when I heard this story, that was the first thing that came to my mind."

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.

Narendra Modi chairs meetings as government gears up for Winter Session

(Prime Minister Modi is understood…)
NEW DELHI: Ahead of Parliament's winter session , Prime Minister Narendra Modi today asked his Council of Ministers to cut down on unnecessary tours to ensure their maximum presence during the month-long affair.
He also asked the ministers to be ready with bills pending in both Houses of Parliament along with new legislative proposals.
Chairing a meeting of the Union Council of Ministers a day after a rejig of the Cabinet, the Prime Minister also gave a pep talk to the newly-appointed ministers on how to go about their job.
He also discussed with his colleagues the strategy to ensure that the session beginning from November 24 and ending on December 23 remains a "smooth affair" for the government during which it plans to pass most of the old pending bills as well as some key new bills.
He advised the ministers to come prepared with proper answers for questions which are posed during Question Hour.
Known as a workaholic, Modi is learnt to have said that ministers do not have offs and they should be prepared to work even on public holidays.
Modi's focus on ensuring that Parliament functions without any hitch comes in the backdrop of the budget session that saw several disruptions.
The Prime Minister also chose the occasion to remind the Ministers of State that they should prove to be "assets" to their ministries. He said the Ministers of State should be given due responsibilities and the Cabinet ministers should ensure that they meet their junior colleagues in the Council of Ministers regularly.
After a two-hour long meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister chaired a 20-minute long meeting of the Union Cabinet, official sources said.
Modi asked the ministers to direct the concerned departments to work effectively and ready the bills by the time the session begins. He also directed the ministers to pay attention towards the completion of old pending bills.
The Prime Minister told the ministers that they should avoid unnecessary tours and be present during the session. The instruction came a day before he leaves for a 10-day visit to Myanmar, Australia and Fiji.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju could not attend the meetings as they were on tour.
Union minister Anant Geete , from the estranged ally Shiv Sena, was present, the sources said.
The month-long session will have a total of 22 sittings in which four days have been earmarked for Private Members' business.
A total of 67 bills -- 59 in Rajya Sabha and eight in Lok Sabha -- are pending and the government will push for passage of "at least 30 to 35" legislations, a senior minister said.
This will be the second major session since the Narendra Modi Government took over in May.
Congress has attacked the Prime Minister on Cabinet expansion accusing him of including "tainted" ministers in the government contrary to his election promise of "cleaning up" Parliament of criminals, a charge vehemently countered by the government and the BJP .
Indications are that Congress would raise the issue in a big way in the upcoming session to put the government on the backfoot.

Why we dont think our own farts stinkBy Rachel Feltman November 10 Follow @rachelfeltman
Nope, it's not just you: Anybody with a nose is going to think that their own gas is less offensive than everyone else's. But it's all an illusion, as the above video by AsapSCIENCE explains.
The science behind our personal fart preferences is pretty simple. We like things (all sorts of things) that are familiar. And the microbes that make our breath, sweat, and gas smell foul to others are pretty dang familiar to us.
Your brain actually stops picking up on lots of scents. If it didn't, you'd be overwhelmed by the constant sensory input of your own smells (and the ones that tend to surround you). It's the same reason a stinky room will get more tolerable after a few minutes of being in it, and why wearing one perfume for too long can make you think that it doesn't smell as strong.
So it's not surprising that your one-of-a-kind farts seem innocuous most of the time. But there's also science behind your sense that other people's gas smells nasty.
In modern, underwear-clad times, flatulence isn't usually a health hazard. But when you think about where that gas is coming from and what kinds of unfamiliar microbes it might carry, it's not surprising that we've evolved to find it disgusting.
But everyone's different, and maybe you're totally nonplussed by others' gaseous emissions. Just like all forms of disgust, this reaction to scent varies person by person. In fact, some research suggests that people who are more anxious or conservative are more sensitive to stink. Conservatives are more likely to react to disgusting images as well, and scientists believe this reaction has to do with a distrust of the "other" -- an instinct to protect one's own body and community.

John Mannings criticism of the new structuralism and my responseBy Will Baude November 10
It’s November, that month when Chicago trees have dropped their leaves, and the Supreme Court issue of the Harvard Law Review thunks on to law professors’ desks around the country. This year, the Foreword to that issue is written by Professor John Manning — The Means of Constitutional Power — and it is about judicial interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause.
From the introduction:
Novel approaches to both statutory interpretation and structural constitutional law, more generally, have become signatures of the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts. A central but overlooked paradox of contemporary structural constitutional law is that the Court has moved in sharply different directions in these two contexts. In matters of statutory interpretation, the Court has shifted toward a new textualism, which has sought (though not with perfect consistency) to promote Congress’s ability to specify with precision the means of constitutional power. In the past, the Court itself had asserted judicial power to reshape the letter of the law to make it cohere better with broader legislative purposes. By adhering, instead, to the words of the statute as written, today’s Court enables Congress more predictably to express its preference for outcomes that may not be so coherent — that include rough accommodations, take only baby steps toward some broader purpose, or adopt crisp rules that favor certainty over achieving a perfect means-ends fit. This regime thus gives Congress greater control over the implementation of its constitutional power.
In constitutional adjudication, by contrast, the Court has asserted greater power than before to second-guess Congress’s judgments about the composition of the federal government and the implementation of federal power. The Rehnquist and Roberts Courts have repeatedly invalidated statutory programs, but not because those programs violated some particular constitutional provision, settled course of constitutional practice, or specific line of judicial precedent. Rather, its “new structuralism” rests on freestanding principles of federalism and separation of powers. In cases involving questions as diverse as the commandeering of state officials, state sovereign immunity, presidential removal power, and standing (to name a few), the Court has moved from high levels of constitutional generality to granular prohibitions on the exercise of legislative power. Because those cases turn on abstract and often conflicting structural policies, their outcomes almost always involve large interpretive discretion and fall within a range in which reasonable people can easily disagree. By exercising independent judgment in those cases, the Court gives itself, rather than Congress, the final say about how to implement federal power. . . .
The text of the Necessary and Proper Clause cuts decisively in favor of one of these conflicting visions. The clause delegates to Congress broad and explicit (though not limitless) discretion to compose the government and prescribe the means of constitutional power. Hence, the Court should respect reasonable legislative exercises of the discretion that the people delegated to Congress rather than the Court. Two considerations support this conclusion. First, if one were to draw an analogy to administrative law, the phrase “necessary and proper” feels like the sort of classic “empty standard” that lawmakers routinely use to delegate discretion. Indeed, under any of the leading theories of its meaning — the ones presently applied by the Court or the revisionist alternatives that have cropped up in recent years — the “necessary and proper” standard inevitably effects a broad delegation of interpretive discretion to someone. Second, the clause directs its delegation explicitly to Congress. And in contrast with substantive power grants like the Commerce Clause or the Bankruptcy Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause is a master provision that allocates decisionmaking responsibility to make laws that implement other constitutional powers. Indeed, the clause empowers Congress to carry into execution not only its own powers, but also “all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.” This breadth indicates that the people not only delegated the implementation power to Congress, but also gave it precedence over the other branches in the exercise of such power.
I have a response in the Harvard Law Review Forum (addressing only the constitutional issues, not the issues of statutory interpretation). It’s titled Sharing the Necessary and Proper Clause , and it begins:
Few constitutional clauses have been the focus of so many hopes and fears as the Necessary and Proper Clause.
In his Foreword, Professor John Manning puts forward a powerful vision of the clause, challenging the current approach of the Supreme Court. Focusing on the text, Manning suggests that it “has the unmistakable feel of an ‘empty standard,’” and is therefore a source of great interpretive discretion. Manning further argues that the text gives that interpretive discretion to Congress. Many of the congressional-power decisions of the Roberts and Rehnquist Courts might fail under this critique. Manning also discusses statutory interpretation, which I lack the space to address here.
Constitutional text is a natural focal point for those who challenge current judicial practice, and Manning is right to ask whether the Court’s doctrines have transgressed or misread the text. But Manning’s proposed reading of the text is not the only one. To choose between them, we need additional sources or theories of meaning, and at least some of them will point to a different assessment than Manning’s.
In this Response, I argue that historical practice, McCulloch v. Maryland, and the text itself all permit, though may not require, a less deferential judicial interpretation than Manning advocates.
Of course I’d like you to read the whole thing .
Will Baude is an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School, where he teaches constitutional law and federal courts.

Despite positive vibes, demand for steel falters
Suresh P Iyengar
Investment crunch Companies are unwilling to put money after experiencing issues over environment clearances and land acquisition.
Unlikely to achieve the targeted growth of 3-5%
Mumbai, November 10:  
Steel demand is yet to revive as fresh investments are still hard to come by despite the positive vibes all around. Corporate houses across sectors are waiting to ramp up their capacity utilisation to the optimum level before taking a call on fresh investments.
Uphill task
Going by the current steel demand, the country may not achieve the targeted growth of 3-5 per cent in the first half of this fiscal.
Steel offtake in the September quarter was down marginally at 18.6 million tonnes (mt) against 18.8 mt in the same period last year. It dipped by 1 per cent to 37.1 mt (37.5 mt) in the first six months of 2014-15.
Steel production in the September quarter was up 3 per cent at 20.81 mt against 20.22 mt registered in the same period last year. In the first half of this fiscal, it was up marginally at 41.59 mt (40.53 mt).
Steel companies, which produced 81.61 mt last financial year, target 4-5 per cent growth this fiscal. The country has an annual production capacity of about 96 mt.
Hanging projects
VS Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director and CFO, JSW Steel, said though the sentiments have turned positive, real investment on the ground is yet to happen as large investments made in the infrastructure sector are still stuck at various levels.
“Few investments were made in the infrastructure space during the first half of this fiscal and the third quarter may not be different with a slew of holidays. In this scenario, it is very unlikely that the annual steel demand growth target would be met,” he said.
Though the Government has announced large infrastructure projects, companies are unwilling to put money on the table, particularly after experiencing issues over environment clearances and land acquisition. The Supreme Court order cancelling 214 of the 218 coal blocks allotted between 1993 and 2010 has caused apprehension among investors.
Awaiting clarity
Vikram Dhawan, Director, Equentis Capital, said fresh investment in the infrastructure space, especially in the power sector, would be restricted until the previous issues are resolved.
“Revival of steel demand is still a few quarters away as the real spending would kick in only after some clarity emerges over the fate of previous investments,” he said.
On the possibility of a lending rate cut spurring overall demand, he said, flow of bank credit to infrastructure projects has been a concern more than the rate of interest.

Government should back Indian firms in overseas expansion: Sunil MittalGovernment should back Indian firms in overseas expansion: Sunil Mittal
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, November 10:  
Bharti Group Founder and Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal on Monday said that Indian companies do not get enough support from the Government for investing in other countries.
“We don't have the massive state support required to push the soft power of Indian enterprise, as companies get in the US, UK, France, Germany," Mittal said at the India Global Forum in New Delhi hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
Mittal said lack of government support comes in the way in countries where Indian companies have to match the money power of Chinese state companies. "We cannot match the amount of money the Chinese are putting in Africa. The good news is we have tremendous amount of goodwill, our relations have developed for over a century. Any leader of any standing in Ethiopia has been taught by Indian teachers," he said.
Mittal said when his company ventured into Sri Lanka, the government there was expecting assistance of $100 million for a project. “I conveyed it in Ministry of External Affairs and officers in Prime Minister Office but nothing moved after that. Few months after that, China doled out cheque of $1 billion to Sri Lanka which helped its companies,” Mittal said.
Mittal said positive changes are taking place under the Modi Government but more needs to be done as many companies are taking risks on their own in investing overseas.
“Indian companies in my mind are taking risks – both geographically and from the business returns point of view – we do not get chaperoned by the Indian Government. We are far from it and in fact, I was complaining about we do not get enough support,” Mittal said. US companies like Google, Facebook, Apple get tremendous support from their governments, he added.
He said if there are capacities for certain companies to go out and scale out even more outside India, they should be very much welcomed and sometimes there are strategic reasons to do it.
Bharti Enterprise chairman recalled a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Russian President Vladimir Putin where Russian conglomerate Sistema’s chairman Yevtushenkov was present during the meeting between heads of the two states.
Mittal said, “A PMO official after the meeting asked me who is Yevtushenkov and said Putin was asking PM why don’t you give a telecom licence to him. I said you should have taken me along with you and I could have also asked for licence in Russia.”

Select Committee to review Insurance Bill on WednesdaySelect Committee to review Insurance Bill on Wednesday
Deepa Nair
Clauses in the Bill to be discussed in-depth to assuage concerns of the Opposition
Mumbai, November 10:  
In the run-up to the introduction of the Insurance Bill in the Winter Session of Parliament, the Select Committee will meet on Wednesday to deliberate over the long pending legislation which seeks to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit from 26 per cent to 49 per cent.
In August, bowing to Opposition pressure, the BJP-led NDA Government had agreed to refer the Insurance Bill to a 15-member panel.
FDI limit
The Bill, which proposes to hike the FDI limit in the insurance sector to 49 per cent, has been caught in a logjam with the Congress-led opposition insisting that it be referred to a select committee. According to sources, the meeting will have a “clause by clause” discussion of the various provisions of the Bill to assuage the concerns of the Congress so that it has a smooth passage in the Winter Session set to begin on November 24.
Industry officials said the Congress has indicated that it will support the Bill if the Government agrees to drop amendments proposed to the earlier Bill, which was introduced during the Congress regime.
Scope of foreign investment
Apart from technical changes, the amendment proposed to the Insurance Bill by the BJP Government includes a clause which seeks to explicitly enlarge the definition of ‘foreign investment’ to include foreign institutional investors. 
The Select Committee has held a series of meetings with different stakeholders, including insurance industry officials, and senior officials from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority.
The Select Committee is chaired by Chandan Mitra from the BJP, and its members include:  Anand Sharma, BK Hariprasad, and JD Seelam (Congress); Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Jagat Prakash Nadda (BJP); Satish Chandra Misra (BSP); KC Tyagi (JD-U); Derek O’Brien (TMC); V Maitreyan (AIADMK); Naresh Gujral (SAD); Ram Gopal Yadav (SP); Kalpataru Das (BJD); P Rajiv (CPI-M); and Rajiv Chandrasekhar (Independent).
The committee is expected to submit its final report to the Government in the third week of November, ahead of the Winter Session.

Up-vote all you want  but the Internet isnt a democracyBy Caitlin Dewey November 7 Follow @caitlindewey
A day in the life of Reddit’s top 100 posts. See interactive version here . (Todd Schneider)
The front page of The Washington Post is carefully plotted by a small team of people with very particular and unyielding tastes.
The front page of the Internet, it turns out, may not be all that different.
Reddit — one of the most powerful determinants of Web news and trends — has long billed itself as a wholly crowd-powered enterprise, subject only to the will of its unpredictable masses. But on Thursday, the software engineer Todd Schneider published a surprising discovery : The articles that “chart” on Reddit’s front page don’t do so on merit, alone. Instead, Reddit employs a kind of algorithmic quota system that moderates which content reaches the masses.
“I had always thought that Reddit’s front pages operated as some kind of direct democracy,” Schneider wrote on his blog. “I was surprised to learn that’s not actually the case.”
It’s not, Reddit admin Chad Birch confirmed on the site itself. Far from relying on raw user votes, the site actually uses a multipart normalization algorithm to get a good mix of content on the front page. As a consequence, of course, a great deal of content that’s very popular with the community never makes it to the front page, at all.
To be clear at the top, this isn’t a scandal or cover-up or huge reveal or anything: Reddit’s code is open source , so anyone with a Github account and a little technological know-how could have sussed out the fact that a normalization algorithm is at play. (A little critical thinking should have turned that up, too: If there weren’t an algorithm guiding the front page, only stuff from the most popular subreddits would ever appear there.) But that said, Schneider’s discovery definitely defies layman assumptions of how Reddit works — and on what principles.
In late summer, after one of his animations hit Reddit’s front page, Schneider devised a bit of code to help figure out exactly how that happened. For six weeks, his script logged the top 100 posts on Reddit every five minutes, dumping the data into a database. When the experiment concluded, Schneider was able to chart the lifecycle of each popular Reddit post, almost like Billboard would chart a song.
The probability that a reddit post will eventually reach the front page, based on its current chart rank. If a post is ranked #26, there is an 84% chance it will reach the top 25, but if a post is ranked #100, then there is only a 15% chance that it will reach the top 25. (Todd Schneider)
He found that not all posts charted equally. Instead, Reddit appeared to suppress the success of content from its largest, most popular subreddits, and elevate content from smaller ones. In fact, Schneider found, each post’s chance of hitting the front page — and with that, going viral on the wider Internet — varied hugely by which forum it started from and where it fell in relation to other posts.
“I’d be curious to see what would happen if all subreddits were treated equally,” Schneider wrote. “My guess is that the reddit default top 100 would contain an even higher rate of funny pictures, but who knows, maybe there’d be some unintended side effects that would lead people to upvote more varied content.”
Which subreddits tend to dominate Reddit’s front page, according to its normalization algorithm. (Todd Schneider)
We don’t know, of course, but recent history would suggest that people tend to fall for the lowest common denominator when given the option. In August, Facebook made changes to its own algorithm to block the very universe of things that Schneider saw screened out of the Reddit homepage. At the time, Facebook explained the changes as an attempt to improve the News Feed. And by all accounts, that’s what Reddit’s doing, too — stepping on the content scales ever so slightly, just to save us from our GIF-loving, Earth-porning, clickbaiting selves.
Algorithms are necessary and important, in many ways: Algorithms order things. Without them we’d be inundated with such a senseless, noisy flood of information that we’d sooner drown than rise up through it; imagine Google searches, except without the relevant results posted first, or a Facebook timeline that showed every single last status update that all 512 of your friends/relatives/exes/long-forgotten classmates make.
You get the idea: That would be terrible! Both sites would be ghost towns.
And yet, Reddit’s algorithms surprise, even discomfit, for a couple reasons. Many users aren’t aware the algorithms are even in operation. (Schneider says none of the users he asked knew about it.) And the front page quota system, together with the well-publicized political wrangling of Reddit’s volunteer moderators , make pretty convincing evidence that “the crowd” has markedly less power than it thinks.
On top of that, there’s a growing sense of anxiety around algorithms on social networks in general, no matter how practical they may be. It’s in our best interest, of course, to see the Yelp reviews by the most reliable writers , and the Amazon products we’re most likely to buy. But increasingly, algorithms filter — and in a substantial way, control — just about everything we see online. There are precious few platforms where that is not the case. (Even Twitter, one of the last mainstream holdouts, recently indicated it was considering a filtered feed.) And that is insidious, really, because you don’t know what you’re not seeing — and in many cases, you don’t realize you’re missing anything, at all .
On Reddit, one user seemed to circle that very question, asking Birch what he thought about the patterns that Schneider’s research turned up. “Do they jive with the vision of Reddit you have?” he asked.
“I think it’s hard to say,” Birch wrote back. “It’s not a simple problem to solve, and it really depends how you want things to behave.”
If you want fewer AMAs , cat GIFs and “ shower thoughts ,” though, it’s pretty okay.

Unclaimed Property -- The Check Is in the MailDormant checking/savings accounts
Rebates
Generally, property becomes classified as UP when the rightful owner takes no action to claim the property for a certain period of time -- this time period is typically referred to as the "dormancy period."  Once the dormancy period has elapsed, the property becomes classified as UP and can become escheatable (i.e. the requirement to remit UP to a state). Consider the following examples:
An employee is unaware she is entitled to a final paycheck and moves out of town before receiving the check.  The company has no forwarding address and is unable to locate the former employee. The uncashed payroll check legally belongs to the employee, but is held by the employer.
A person purchases a100 gift certificate from Company X. After three years, the gift certificate has still not been redeemed. The100 still legally belongs to the purchaser (in most states), not Company X.
What Should a Business Do With UP?
It is important to note that UP is administered at the state level. In fact, all 50 states and Washington D.C. have their own laws and regulations regarding types of property that can be classified as UP, the dormancy period by property type, and the reporting requirements for holders of UP. Before property is classified as UP, holders must exhaust all options to try and locate the property's rightful owner.  Many states dictate by law specific actions a holder of UP must take to find the property's owner.
The U.S. Supreme Court has established two primary jurisdictional rules that dictate the state where UP is to be remitted based on specific fact patterns. Under the primary-priority rule, the holder must report UP to the state of the rightful owner's last known address.  If the owner is unknown or the holder lacks the owner's address records, the second-priority rule provides that the holder must remit the UP to the holder's state of incorporation. Based on this last rule, it makes perfect sense why UP collections are such an important component of Delaware's economy.
When advising businesses that have historically never reported UP, I strongly advise the owners to follow some basic guidelines:
Become familiar with the various types of UP and determine if your business has such property on its books and records.
Understand the dormancy period for each class of UP that the business may have.
Uncashed checks/refunds due to customers or vendors should not be reversed into income.
If your business has UP, proactively resolve the situation.  In general, states tend to be more forgiving when a company voluntarily remits past due UP than when the state identifies a case of non-compliance through an audit.

Snag grounds Air India’s Newark plane, crew shortage delays London flight

air transport
Air India passengers bound to New York and London had a harrowing time at the city airport after the airline had to cancel the flight due to a technical snag and duty time curbs on crew and the other flight because of a mock drill at the airport.
While a technical snag and duty time restrictions on cabin crew grounded AI 191 Mumbai-Newark flight on Saturday, the Mumbai-London flight (AI 131) was delayed by nearly three hours due to the mock drill at the airport. When contacted, Air India admitted to the delays and claimed that passengers had been taken care of.
“Yes, we had to cancel the AI 191 Mumbai-Newark flight with 191 passengers due to a technical snag yesterday. When the snag was rectified, the FDTL (flight duty time limit) of the cabin crew came into being and thus had to cancel the flight,” Air India said in a statement.
The airline further said out of the 191 passengers, 44 were provided hotel accommodation and the rest who came from Mumbai were given taxi fares. All of them were accommodated on Sunday’s flight at 1.30 a.m. which had full load of 303 passengers.
The passengers who came from Ahmedabad were sent to Delhi for the JFK flight which departed at 2 a.m. on Sunday from the national capital, the airline said.
As regards the delay of AI 131 Mumbai-London flight, the airline blamed it on the mock drill at the airport.
“Though the flight was ready for departure at 1400 hrs yesterday, it was delayed to 1620 hrs due to a mock drill by MIAL which lasted till 1530 hrs,” AI said. In the past few weeks, AI had been facing severe delays, so much so that the aviation ministry had to issue instructions to the national airline to improve its on-time performance.

During the period, the company’s consolidated total income increased by 36 per cent to Rs.4,148 crore from Rs.3,045 crore in the same period last year.
“Our result reflects higher volume of power generation and improved operational efficiencies which were off-set by the challenges in business that have led to power purchase agreements (PPAs) becoming non-remunerative coupled with limited availability of domestic coal,” said Adani Power Chief Executive Officer Vineet S. Jain. “However, with implementation of tariff orders and improving operational efficiencies, we are confident of revival in our power business performance,” Mr. Jaain added.
Adani Power shares closed with a loss of 2.41 per cent at Rs.46.50 on the BSE.

US, China wrangle over rival FTAs casts shadow on APEC Summit

APEC
(TPP will bring 40% of global…)
BEIJING: The differences between the US and China over rival free trade agreements being floated by them threatened to derail the APEC Summit which got off to a colourful start here today.
Addressing the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO meet after his arrival here to take part in the APEC leaders summit, US President Barack Obama asserted that Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) being floated by Washington is the best for the region.
If completed it will bring 40 per cent of global economy under an agreement for increasing trade, jobs, high standards for workers and intellectual protection, he said.
"If China and the United States can work together, the world benefits," he said.
Obama noted that enhancing China's integration to the world economy is in "US' best interest and the world's best interest."
"We want China to do well. We compete for business, but we also seek to cooperate on a broad range of shared challenges and shared opportunities" in fighting Ebola spread, stopping nuclear proliferation, deepening clear energy partnership, and combating climate change, he said.
China, the world's largest trading nation, is concerned because TPP excludes it.
TPP is backed by Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan , Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam, all sharing close ties with Washington.
To avert its exclusion, China is aggressively pushing Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) in which US has shown little interest.
Chinese President Xi Jinping , who is hosting the 21-member conference, said the FTAAP does not go against existing free trade arrangements in the region.
"The FTAAP does not go against existing free trade arrangements, which are the potential pathways to realise the FTAAP goals," Xi said speaking at the dialogue between the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders and representatives of the APEC Business Advisory Council.
The FTAAP can be the "aggregation" of existing free trade arrangements, he said.
The aim of pushing forward the FTAAP process is to consolidate the regional integration and define long-term goals, he said.
Xi outlined four achievements of the Beijing's APEC meet which included the (FTAAP) process, issuance of a statement on the future vision of APEC and promoting of innovation, reforms and growth to seek new momentum in the region and a blueprint to lay a solid foundation for all-round connectivity in the Asia-Pacific.
Obama along with Russian President Vladimir Putin , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with other APEC leaders took part in the glittering ceremonies arranged by China, displaying its opulence.
The leaders were treated to some spectacular dances converting the 2008 Olympic arena into a massive colourful stage with lighting and fireworks.
China has shut down hundreds of factories in the vicinity to ensure pollution free meeting and constructed a new conference theatre at an island close to Beijing.
The leaders meeting will take place tomorrow after which Obama and Xi would hold bilateral talks on Wednesday in an attempt bring down their differences on a host of global issues.
In his address outlining US policy on China, Obama stated that US welcomes the rise of a prosperous, peaceful and stable China but at the same time US-China relationship is not a "zero-sum game" and benefits both countries and the world.
As the world's two largest economies, the two countries "have special responsibilities to embrace," Obama said.
Obama also announced the two nations have agreed to implement a new visa arrangement during his visit, which will extend the student visa from one year to five years, and business and tourist visa to 10 years.
This will benefit students and business large and small, Obama said, adding China's economic development and Chinese tourists made positive contribution in creating jobs for Americans and hence promoting the country's economy.
Obama said he "very much appreciated" Xi's efforts to promote bilateral ties.
Noting US security and prosperity "is inextricably intertwined with Asia," Obama explained that the region is "an incredible opportunity for creating jobs and economic growth for the United States."
"Over the next five years, nearly half of all economic growth outside the United States is projected to come from right here, in Asia," he said.
Speaking of economic cooperation among APEC members, the US President said that "in the 21st century, the pursuit of economic growth, job creation and trade is not a zero-sum game."
One country's prosperity does not have to come at the expense of another.
"Working together, we need the growth that is balanced, growth that is strong, growth that is sustainable, and growth where prosperity is shared by everybody who is willing to working hard," Obama said.

How The Newsroom missed its chanceBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 10 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg

“We did everything right!” Atlantis Cable News anchor Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels) laments at the end of the first episode of the third season of Aaron Sorkin’s sour show about the state of the media, “The Newsroom.” Will is lamenting his broadcast’s fall from second place to a dismal fourth, despite improvements in the quality of the journalism he and his staff have put on the air.
But he might as well speaking for Sorkin, despairing over the way critics failed to embrace “The Newsroom” with the same fervor they brought to “Sports Night” or “The West Wing.” And Will’s sadness goes a long way to explaining why “The Newsroom,” unlike something like “Nightcrawler,” has never been particularly fun to watch or a particularly incisive critique of the media. It is a show about people who are doing what they think is the right thing and losing anyway. But instead of being tragic, they’re petty. And instead of innovating their way out of the mess, they are being grouchy that the grand old days are gone.
The new season of “The Newsroom” — I have seen three episodes so far — has some fizz to it. Blogger Neal Sampat’s (Dev Patel) Internet obsession pays off when someone reaches out to request his encryption key. Producer Maggie (Alison Pill) bounces back from her tragic haircut and even more tragic experiences reporting in Africa and has a meet-cute on a train! Executive producer Don (Thomas Sadoski) and economics correspondent Sloan (Olivia Munn) decide that they are officially dating in a fittingly awkward fashion. We get Kat Dennings! And later, Clea Duvall and Keith Powell, who played Toofer on “30 Rock”!
There are the same, glum old tendencies, too. “Worst moment in this guy’s life, and you’re cheering? And why? Because you think that if someone gets behind you in line, that the line moved,” ACN president Charlie Skinner lectures newsroom employees who cheer when CNN has to retract a story it sourced through social media but did not bother to verify by more conventional means. “He got knocked down. You didn’t get taller.”
But the whole premise of “The Newsroom” is to knock down existing news organizations by having fictional characters re-report real stories, and to have the ACN staff do it better than the real reporters and look taller as a result. “We’re not going based on tweets from witnesses we can’t talk to. What credible news agency would do that?” pontificates MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer), the show’s executive producer, refusing to acknowledge the space between treating tweets as authoritative and ignoring them altogether.
It is this sort of lack of self-awareness (much less sense of humor) that can make “The Newsroom” such a slog. And these tendencies are exemplified by the utter charmlessness of what is supposed to be the show’s central romance, between Will and his executive producer MacKenzie, who bask in each other’s self-righteousness and complain when people are not RSVPing fast enough for their $210-a-plate wedding. They’re so unpleasant to be around it would be an honor not to be invited to the damn nuptials, or at the very least to be seated at what becomes a much-discussed “losers’ table.”
In 2012, after “The Newsroom” finished its first season, I found myself arguing with Sorkin at the Television Critics Association press tour about why he had chosen to depict the shining future of cable news as a cranky, middle-aged white dude. The question was motivated by what looked like a brief spurt of innovation and success at MSNBC that, two years down the road, has not quite panned out the way it once seemed like it might.
The intervening time, though, has given us other glimpses of what a forward-looking story about the news business might have looked like.
The Edward Snowden leaks, which “The Newsroom” has riffed on this season, might have been the basis for a look at the tensions between old-line news organizations like The Washington Post and innovators like Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras. Fox News’ flair for entertainment could have been the basis for a scabrous and self-aware satire (as could Buzzfeed’s combination of clicky social content and huge staff of serious journalists doing great work). And if Sorkin really wanted to make an optimistic series about a scrappy band of principled journalists trying to build a space for themselves, he might have created a show about an emerging team like the one at Fusion.
“The Newsroom” is better in its third season and has flickers of the show it might have been. But it keeps failing in the same old ways because neither Will McAvoy nor his creator seem to be able to acknowledge that they did not do everything right.

00:02  I'm having Malcolm with USA today Pizza Hut is going
00:06  through aimed some major changes. I'm here with marketing reporter Bruce
00:10  or guys to talk about what is going on act. Britain
00:13  walk us through some of these huge revamp that defense. So
00:17  when you think of Pizza Hut you think of the change
00:19  that is taken essentially a giant pizza. Thrown a bunch of
00:23  stuff on and thrown it up in the air it's falling
00:26  down and they're hoping it falls right side. This is a
00:29  chain desperate for change. So. They figured out you know what
00:35  we gotta get young people eager again for the first time.
00:39  In its history as they say they are turning everything upside
00:42  down they want people to become able to come into the
00:45  place. Not just choose from a few toppings they can put
00:50  on the pizza but from. Not just. Do you want sauce
00:56  or not but do you want one of ten was offices
00:59  they're really expanding and then why doesn't need. Typically. The chain
01:05  likes to make one or two changes and then we concede
01:09  that work and give it time given a few weeks giving
01:11  few months it works or doesn't. When you make this many
01:15  changes at once. It's very difficult to change to see which
01:20  change was hit in which change. So. This is a sign
01:26  about a company that really really. Either needs or wants change
01:32  fast. Avenue dime place they've had to. Consecutive years of same
01:38  store sales declines they do so. And it seems like a
01:42  lot of food brands in the past couple months in the
01:44  past year I'm going through these kinds of changes maybe not
01:48  to this degree that he has taken on but. You know
01:51  Taco Bell getting in to Brack fast and people revamping many
01:54  years and you said that McDonald's is even casting something in

02:03  the way they give us. Yeah good question so we have
02:06  this. You have this industry it's like 200 billion dollars. So
02:11  even though you know it seems like this silly thing like
02:14  you know. I mean it's a burger it's a slice of
02:17  pizza but it's not it's a lot of money and these
02:22  brands depend on what they stand for and what they have
02:26  to stand for is bringing in attracting young people. So who's
02:31  doing what. You got McDonald's McDonald's. Now testing a format that's
02:36  some else feels tastes like. To pull away. Panera Bread five
02:44  guys. All of these chains that let young people choose but
02:47  they actually want to eat including what went out. Whole grain
02:51  Bonn or not. McDonald's. Is testing this in a few stores
02:55  in Southern California. This will grow larger. Taco Bell getting into
03:01  breakfast and making fun of McDonald's breakfast in the process. This

Pizza Hut is rebooting itself for a new generation of pizza eaters.
Following two years of disappointing sales as consumers sought even more exotic flavors and personalized options, the world's largest pizza chain on Monday will announce plans to turn upside down almost every facet of its identity.
Pizza Hut will focus on dozens of new flavor options as it mounts the 56-year-old brand's biggest-ever redo. It will add 11 new pizza recipes, 10 new crust flavors, six new sauces, five new toppings, four new flavor-pack drizzles, a new logo, new uniforms and, yes, even a new pizza box.
For those keeping count, the chain is more than doubling its available ingredients at all 6,300 U.S. locations beginning Nov. 19.
"This is the biggest change we've ever made," Carrie Walsh, chief marketing officer, says in a telephone interview. "We're redefining the category."
The ongoing tailspin -- eight consecutive quarters of same-store sales declines -- recently resulted in a management reshuffle.  David Gibbs, who has been U.S president, was named CEO last week. He was not available for this story.
Even the chain's sister brands at Yum Brands — Taco Bell and KFC — generally have been growing, but Pizza Hut seems to have hit a wall. Will these changes be enough to heal an ailing brand?  Or, perhaps, are they too many, too late?
"Pizza Hut may be doing too much too quickly," says Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic, the restaurant industry research specialist. "It would appear that the brand that has lost touch with the consumer is trying to change too much overnight."  He suggests a more gradual approach because, among other things, all of these changes could particularly confuse the chain's traditional customers.
Not so, says Walsh. Pizza Hut researched "hundreds" of ingredients, she says.  "These are the ones customers told us they want."
It's not the first time a major pizza chain tried to quickly reinvent itself.  Back in 2009, Domino's, which had taken plenty of public grief for the taste of its pizza, changed everything in the recipe of its core pizza.  New sauce. New crust. New cheese.  It turned out to be a hit.
In this case, however, Pizza Hut is not changing its core recipe. Instead, it's adding many, many more choices.
How many?  Who's counting.  But consider this:  There will now be about 1,000 ways to customize something as basic as a pepperoni pizza at Pizza Hut, says Walsh.
Among Pizza Hut's new offerings, it's going from:
• One crust choice to 10,  including salted pretzel and honey sriracha.
• One sauce choice to six, including garlic Parmesan and Buffalo.
• Zero "premium" toppings to five,  including sliced banana peppers and Peruvian cherry peppers.
• Zero "drizzles" to five, which are basically sauces like Buffalo and balsamic that are lightly drizzled on the top of the pizza after it's baked.
• Six special recipes to 22, including 7-Alarm Fire (loaded with peppers and jalapeno) to Giddy-Up Barbecue Chicken (with chicken and bacon and barbecue sauce.)
It also will nationally roll-out a so-called Skinny Slice pizza line -- with five offerings at about 250 calories per slice.
To announce the change, the chain will launch its largest-ever advertising campaign dubbed "The Flavor of Now," says Walsh, though she declines to provide details.  There's even a possibility that the chain, which hasn't advertised during a Super Bowl in 15 years, is considering such a move for the upcoming big game on Feb. 1.
"We're looking," says Walsh. "This change deserves a big statement."

Amicus brief supporting the dismissal of the Gov. Rick Perry prosecution in TexasBy Eugene Volokh November 10 Follow @volokhc
I’m delighted to report that my friend Jim Ho (former Texas Solicitor General) of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Prerak Shah of Gibson Dunn, and I have filed an amicus brief supporting the dismissal of the prosecution of Gov. Rick Perry, on behalf of many notable people on both sides of the political aisle:
Leading First Amendment lawyer and scholar Floyd Abrams;
Michael Barone, a leading scholar of American politics, and the main coauthor of The Almanac of American Politics ;
Prof. Ashutosh Bhagwat (UC Davis);
Jeff Blackburn, Founder and Chief Counsel of the Innocence Project of Texas;
Paul Coggins, former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas (1993-2001);
Prof. Alan Dershowitz (Harvard);
Justice Raul Gonzalez, former Justice of the Texas Supreme Court;
Jim Ho (as I mentioned, former Texas Solicitor General);
Prof. Daniel Lowenstein (UCLA), former founding chair of the California Fair Political Practices Commission;
Prof. Michael McConnell (Stanford), former judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit;
John T. Montford, former Lubbock County DA, former Texas State Senator, and the first Chancellor of the Texas Tech University System;
Ted Olson, former Solicitor General of the United States;
Ken Starr, former judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and former Solicitor General of the United States; and
me.
Here is the Introduction; I’ll post the text of the brief shortly (as to the separation of powers argument on count I , the immunity argument on count I , and the freedom of speech argument on count II , but you can read the PDF here .
* * *
Governor Rick Perry announced that he would exercise his constitutional authority to veto a bill if another political official did not do what he wanted.  Then he vetoed that bill.  For these two ordinary political acts, Governor Perry has been indicted on felony charges.
Both counts of the indictment are unconstitutional and must be dismissed.  The first count — which criminalizes Governor Perry’s veto of a bill — violates the separation of powers enshrined in the Texas Constitution.  The Legislature is not allowed to criminalize the exercise of powers that the Constitution specifically confers on the Governor, including the veto power.
And the second count — which criminalizes Governor Perry’s threat to veto a bill if Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg did not resign her office — violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 8 of the Texas Constitution.  Governor Perry “threatened” to perform an act that the Texas Constitution specifically reserved to him (a veto) in order to encourage a public official to engage in a lawful act (a resignation).  That is constitutionally protected speech.
* * *We as amici take no position on the politics that led to this indictment.  Reasonable people can disagree on the political tactics employed by both Governor Perry and his opponents.  But to turn political disagreement into criminal prosecution is disturbing.  To do so with an indictment riddled with constitutional infirmities is even worse.
The indictment of Governor Perry demands this Court’s swift intervention.  The writ of habeas corpus should be granted and this prosecution should come to an end.

How brown fat  the good fat  burns calories and could help treat type 2 diabetes and obesityBy Abby Phillip November 10 Follow @abbydphillip
A 15-year-old boy with type 2 diabetes checks his blood sugar. A better understanding of "brown fat" could lead to new treatments for the condition. (Richard A. Lipski/The Washington Post)
By now, you may have heard about brown adipose tissue , or "brown fat." It is a type of fat, most likely present in all humans, that is a super calorie burner.
In recent years, a renewed interest in brown fat has revealed some promising attributes. Not only does brown fat play a role in warming up the body in cold temperatures, but by doing that, it is also an extraordinarily efficient calorie burner. And while some people may have more of this fat than others, there are ways of increasing the amount of brown fat in your body.
A new study has unveiled a piece of the puzzle in the emerging research into this remarkable tissue. Brown fat, it turns out, acts as a "super vacuum" to suck up excess glucose (sugar) in the blood by producing large amounts of a substance that transports glucose into the brown fat cells, where it can be burned to produce heat -- a process called thermogenesis.
"If you can start the tissue to burn and produce heat, then you can actually in a way take away excess glucose in the blood," said Tore Bengtsson, one of the study's authors and a professor of physiology at Stockholm University in Sweden. "Now we actually understand how this production of these glucose transporters work."
Brown fat cells do this at a more efficient rate than other mechanisms the body uses to absorb glucose in the blood. When activated, the brown fat cells produce 10 or more times the amount of glucose transporters than insulin, for example, according to Bengtsson.
For people with type 2 diabetes, whose bodies do not use insulin properly and as a result have elevated blood glucose levels, these findings could lead to new drugs that can activate brown cells and reduce blood glucose levels without insulin.
More than 29 million Americans live with type 2 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association . And more than one-third of U.S. adults are obese , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; obesity can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes .
"The implication of this is normally when you have type 2 diabetes you have to inject insulin to reduce your blood sugar levels," Bengtsson said. "However you could make a medicine which is not based on insulin signalling. It's a completely new pathway that can be targeted for taking up glucose in the blood."
The study, published in the Journal of Cell Biology on Monday, helps to connect the dots between years of findings suggesting that better understanding brown tissue can lead to new treatments for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The tissue, which is typically found around the neck and spinal cord, is more present in the body when you are young; people who are overweight or obese tend to have less of it.
Initially, beyond infants who need the heat-producing tissue to maximize survival in the first days and months of life, scientists didn't fully understand whether adult humans had and used brown tissue. But recent research has also found that the amount of brown tissue grows in cold weather or when people are exposed to cold environments. Conversely, it declines in warm environments.
The findings support what scientists believe are the evolutionary origins of the tissue. In mammals and in humans, it helps regulate body temperature by converting glucose and free fatty acids in the blood into heat that the body might need to survive in colder temperatures.
"Brown fat has been investigated for a very long time in small mammals," noted Bengtsson. "Five or six years ago, we actually understood that we had brown fat in humans and the brown fat is working in humans -- not only in infant humans but in adults."
Bengtsson said that he is working on the next step in the research -- looking for specific ways of activating the cells, which will be crucial for the development of new drugs.

Cyber Monday  Humbug: This Day Has the Best DealsEmail
If you're looking to get the most bang for your buck online this holiday, it'll require some unconventional thinking. 
While Cyber Monday is often touted as the best day to browse the web for discounts, new research from Adobe found that in reality, Thanksgiving is the best day for online deals, offering consumers an average discount of 24 percent. 
It's followed by Black Friday as the second best day for deals, and then the Monday before Thanksgiving. Cyber Monday ranked fourth.

Put down the carving knife and pick up the laptop. Thanksgiving may be the best day for online deals.
"Retailers got really scrunched last year," said Tamara Gaffney, Adobe Digital Index's principal analyst. 
That's because there were six fewer days before Thanksgiving and Christmas, causing retailers to proactively slash their prices to grab hold of shoppers' wallets earlier in the season. Although companies will gain an extra shopping day this year because of the calendar shift, a similarly early push is already taking shape, with retailers including Amazon and Wal-Mart kicking off Black Friday specials over Halloween weekend. 
Although many consumers criticize the Christmas creep—in particular, retailers' plans to open even earlier on Thanksgiving Day—the strategy appears to be working. According to a study by Accenture, 45 percent of consumers said they will shop that day this year, up from 38 percent in 2013.
While mobile is a key driver behind this trend, according to IBM, it's not only restricted to online. A forecast released by ShopperTrak last month predicted that for the first time since 2005, Black Friday will no longer be the biggest day for store visits and sales. Instead, as Thanksgiving continues to steal share from Friday, it will be overtaken by the Saturday before Christmas, known as Super Saturday, on those two metrics.
Video: TODAY Financial Editor Jean Chatzky breaks down the secret deals of Cyber Monday and how you could come out the digital winner of the day.
"Retailers are anxious to get to the wallet before the money is gone," ShopperTrak founder Bill Martin said. 
For her part, Gaffney said she's a proponent of Cyber Monday shifting to the Monday before Thanksgiving, or possibly earlier. For one, this would help retailers avoid logistical nightmares caused by last-minute shoppers; for another, it would help them compete with international companies that are increasingly targeting U.S. shoppers, such as Alibaba's promotions for China's Single's Day holiday on Nov. 11. 
"That's actually possibly going to move these promotional activities even earlier," Gaffney said. 
All of this is not to say that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are no longer relevant. According to Adobe, Cyber Monday's online sales are expected to hit a record high of $2.6 billion this year, while Black Friday's online sales could rise to $2.48 billion. Both days drastically surpass that of Thanksgiving, which is expected to ring in a record $1.35 billion online. 
From a consumer perspective, there are also certain purchases that are better suited for Cyber Monday. According to DealNews, clothing, shoes and beauty items are all cheaper that day than on Thanksgiving or Black Friday.

2015 Lexus NX 300h cuts sporty edge in hybrid crossovers0
Voice commands on the Entune system returned a remarkably high percentage of requests. There is still the call and response set up, but it can be bypassed with shortcuts that any Lexus owner will quickly learn. The redundant steering wheel controls are complemented by a three-inch touch pad between the gear stick and the cup holders. Move your finger over the pad and the arrow moves on the seven-inch screen in the dash. Even at highway speeds the touchpad finds its intended spots on the screen, though you might accidentally push down on the pad and open a new submenu on the screen. It's not perfect, none are, but it's simpler than Mercedes' system in the ML crossover, and puts Lexus firmly where it should be in the vanguard of upscale models.
To let you know that Lexus has taken thoughtful and overdue consideration of in-car technology, a wireless charging tray comes available in the armrest console. It charges Android devices, says Lexus, but iOS devices are restricted by Apple as of this writing. There is a USB port as well.
Driving the NX hybrid around town for a week reveals some pleasant surprises. Despite all the sporty design elements, the quiet, comfy ride is punctuated by fuel economy that is so stunning it makes us think the trip meter is broken. We took several 25-mile trips in varying degrees of traffic. The best rate came at 29 miles per hour under normal driving circumstances, where the NX 300h returned 46.9 mpg. That is near Prius levels. On another trip averaging 24 mph, we got 40.3 mpg. The mid to upper 20s must be the sweet spot because speeds over 50 mph returned 33 mpg, which is in line with EPA readings.
The hybrid has four modes — EV, Eco, Normal, and Sport — but you are only choosing between Eco or Sport. EV kicks on automatically with regenerative braking or low acceleration under 20 mph, and Normal mode is the default. Sport mode doesn't add all that much to acceleration unless you override it with the quasi-manual known as Shiftronic, which lets you control the shifts on the electronic continuously variable transmission (eCVT). Without it, the eCVT is odd to comprehend. Flooring it in Sport mode resulted in a spike in the RPM gauge but not the corresponding acceleration, almost like a muted turbo lag. Instead of a turbo, the hybrid has a kickdown feature, which means the transmission shifts into the lowest gear possible under hard acceleration, which might explain the lag as the eCVT finds that low "gear." The vast majority of hybrid buyers shouldn't notice it or else they should buy the 200t. Otherwise the eCVT is smooth, linear and unnoticeable, even when the 2.5-liter in-line four cylinder engine kicks on.
The NX 300h builds on the refinement and quality Lexus is known for and adds sharp edges that should please Lexus lovers and appeal to the coveted luxury newcomers.

Rupee at 3-week low vs dollar ahead of US jobs reportThe Indian rupee on Friday dropped to nearly three and a half week low to close at 61.62 against the Greenback, down 21 paise, on sustained dollar demand from importers ahead of a key US jobs report.
The renewed strength of dollar is keeping emerging market currencies under immense pressure, a forex dealer noted.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange market (Forex), the domestic unit commenced lower at 61.52 a dollar as against Wednesday’s close of 61.41 and moved in a range of 61.4875 and 61.6750. It finished at 61.62, showing a loss of 21 paise, or 0.34 per cent.
This is the weakest level for the rupee since 61.83 on October 16.
“The USD/INR pair will take cues from the non farm payroll data scheduled for release later in the day,” said India Forex Advisors.
Non-farm payroll figures out of Washington later Friday will give a better handle on the state of the US economy.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 1,030.85 crore on Wednesday, as per provisional data released by the stock exchanges.
The US Greenback surged to more than five-year high against major currencies.
Meanwhile, the benchmark Sensex retreated from its record-breaking run and settled lower at 27,868.63, down 47.25 points or 0.17 per cent.
On a weekly basis, rupee has registered its second weekly loss in a row taking cues from the strong dollar.
In the forwards market, premium continued its weak trend on presistent receipts from exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in April declined to 212.5-214.5 paise from previous close of 218-220 paise.
Far-forward contracts maturing in October, 2015 also fell to 422-424 paise from 431-433 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.5205 and for the Euro at 76.1562.
The rupee recovered against the pound to 97.53 from previous closing level of 97.60 and also recouped to 76.40 per euro against 76.67.
It also rebounded to end at 53.50 per 100 Japanese yen from Wednesday’s level of 53.65.

Wal-Mart to focus on food safety in China  Asia chief saysPrice was named on Tuesday the head of the retailer's Asia Pacific business, in a move aimed at reviving Wal-Mart's slowing growth amid stiff competition in the region.
In Japan, the company said in October it would close 30 underperforming stores to scale back.
In India, Wal-Mart last year ended a six-year partnership with Bharti Enterprises Pvt and started to run wholesale stores instead of its common retail ones.
In China, Price said Wal-Mart has experienced "a few bumps along the road". China was the only market of Wal-Mart's five largest ones that saw falling same-store sales in the second quarter, down 1.6 percent from the year-earlier period.
In Wal-Mart's global markets, Wal-Mart reported for the six months ended July 31, pre-tax income outside the U.S. down three percent to $11.83 billion from a year-earlier, according to the company's filings.
In October, Wal-Mart lowered its earnings forecast for this fiscal year, blaming a tough economy for the company's low-income customers. The retailer said to expect annual sales to grow in the range of two to three percent, two percentage points down from its earlier guidance.
Price said the company would "continue to invest very aggressively" with a focus on food quality and safety to push up traffic to Wal-Mart's Chinese stores.
Wal-Mart said in June it would increase its spending on food safety in China to 300 million yuan ($49 million) in 2013, 2014 and 2015, up from a previously-announced 100 million yuan.
"The 'fresh' experience is an area where we can differentiate. We are the only retailer in China that has 100 percent of our 'fresh' going through distribution centers," he said.
"China is a big part of the future game," Price added. Last year in October, Wal-Mart announced plans to open up to 110 new facilities in China between 2014 and 2016.
Price will continue to help run strategy and international development as an executive vice president based in Bentonville, Arkansas. He had held the role for five years until June when returning to the U.S. to run the company's global strategy.
Wal-Mart will report its third quarter earnings on Nov. 13.

Reinvent Yourself: Company Founder Secrets on How to Profitably Follow Your Passionsreddit
Morningstar founder and CEO Joe Mansueto had lots to say when I asked him how he started a modest financial directory in his apartment and grew it to 3,800 employees around the world with $700 million annual revenue.
In my How They Did It interview with Joe, he said it was only by acts of reinvention that he could grow, and that Morningstar could grow to what it is today, the premier provider of financial information in many markets.
Many of us feel like we are stuck on a path we can't change. Maybe it's the time already invested or fear that making a change could actually be a worse mistake. But the majority of successful entrepreneurs and professionals make a leap into uncharted territory.
You may not be setting out to create the next Morningstar, but if you're a professional and need to pivot, shift, or jumpstart your career - what do you do? How do you reinvent yourself?
For more answers I went to professionals who radically took on the challenge of reinvention. Here are their keys for success:
1. Pay Attention as Your Sense of Purpose Evolves. Scott Keffer took a turn in his career to launch a financial advisor bootcamp. Prior to this, Scott was very successful as a financial advisor with many clients - until he got the itch to make a bigger impact. He looked at how he could bring his expertise to his competitors...yes, competitors. He envisioned talking in front of hundreds of colleagues instead of advising clients one on one. Slowly but surely his own definition of his best and highest purpose was changing and expanding. As Scott told me, "I can impact fifty clients' lives - but through other advisors, I can impact fifty thousand lives."
2. Observe Your Passions. Scott says he noticed that when he talked about how to help others, his passion re-doubled, or as he said, he had a moment of affirmation.
3. Stretch! Jim Camp is an expert negotiation coach, having coached big names like TJ Rogers, CEO of Cypress Semiconductor, and even the FBI in hostage situations. After flying a fighter jet in the US Air Force, Jim continued his love of flying, becoming a commercial pilot. He started to think about what he had learned from flying and realized that systems, protocols and processes that had been drilled into him had kept him alive. He decided that those same kinds of systems could help in everyday life. He put this theory into practice, coaching a business friend in a negotiation. Casual help turned into formal clients, while Jim continued to develop a decision-based negotiations system, stretching himself along the way. He reinvented himself in amazing ways. Jim wasn't a great writer, but he wrote a best-selling book, Start With No , now translated into many languages and sold worldwide. He didn't understand computer technology, but created an online negotiation system for sales professionals.
4. Look for Solutions in Your Problems. Scott says "the frustrations I encountered as an advisor, which I solved through coaching, training and creating systems and processes, have been the source of our innovation. If it was a problem and frustration for me, it must be for others as well. Focusing on our ideal clients and their biggest frustrations and problems is our prime source for new offerings."
5. Keep Learning. Joe Mansueto was a great student of success, reading biographies of successful leaders and intensely analyzing how great success was achieved. He specifically said learning was his way to avoid failing and that he would rather learn from someone else's mistakes and get it right the first time.
6. Follow Your Mission and Purpose. Scott says "there are always moments of commitment...points of no return." For Scott, he had to take a leap and wind down his financial practice. Jim quit his job as a pilot to start a career in negotiation coaching. Joe quit his job as an analyst to launch Morningstar. These are make or break moments fueled by a burning desire to achieve your mission and purpose. Burning desire doesn't always lead to instant success.  "Flops are almost always from cutting corners, from falling short on fundamentals," Jim says. "You only learn from failing and so when you do fail, you have to go back and start over."
7. Stay on Track. Your commitment will be tested. And re-tested. When Scott decided to start coaching other financial advisors, his income from his legacy business declined, but new income did not catch up right away. He had to keep at it to see the fruits of his labor. The lesson I learned time and again from interviewing champion company founders is that invariably the first effort, product or strategy fails. It's a bust. What do you do then? In tech circles everyone uses the word pivot, meaning to find your Plan B. For Scott he had to double down, meaning coming up with new ideas like live Boot Camps for financial planners as a way to generate income.
Ultimately Scott succeeded - his "Double You Affluent Clients" program and live seminars are known to thousands of financial advisors across the US. Throughout it all, Scott says he had to keep reaffirming his own vision weekly and even daily.
In Jim's case he realized "the world was mine. I just had to take it. I had an opportunity. I woke up one morning, and had to focus all my attention on a new direction. At that point making the jump was easy. I had such a powerful mission and purpose and surrounded myself with great people, and if I failed, I would learn and go back at it."

Advertising council to get more teethUpdated: November 10, 2014 13:36 IST
Advertising council to get more teeth

business enterprises
The ASCI, which is to partner the Department of Consumer Affairs soon, will be more like a quasi-judicial body rather than an advisory body.
Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), which is a self-regulatory body for the advertising industry, will soon be more than a watchdog for the industry.
ASCI, which is mainly a recommendatory body, is partnering with the government’s Department of Consumer Affairs in order to ensure better compliance with accepted codes of advertising. The partnership is expected to be announced very soon.
``ASCI will certainly get more teeth and will be more like a quasi-judicial body rather than an advisory body,’’ Srinivasan Swamy, CMD of RK Swamy BBDO, and board member of ASCI said. ``It is an important development for self regulation.’’
``ASCI has over 30 years of experience in dealing with complaints and ensuring compliance,’’ Arvind Sharma, former chairman & CEO, Leo Burnett – India subcontinent and a board member of ASCI, told this correspondent. ``Working with ASCI, the Department for Consumer Affairs will have ready infrastructure, experience and domain knowledge of ASCI and from the consumer point of view compliance can be ensured in a shorter period of time.’’
ASCI has, over the years, become increasingly active in addressing concern regarding content in advertising. It already works with the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting and the after ASCI’s code of ethics was incorporated in the Cable TV network Rules in 2006, television advertisements have to comply with and follow the rulings of the ASCI’s Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) which can ask for banning of or modification of advertisements.
Mr. Sharma said there were no problems of compliance by advertisers and that by and large, advertisers complied with the rulings when asked to modify or withdraw an advertisement which violated any laws of the land or affected sensitivities.
It is believed that working with the government will help ensure even better and speedier compliance.
Mr. Swamy, who is also president, International Advertising Association – India chapter, said the fact that the government has embraced and supported the need for self-regulation of the industry makes it interesting. ``Self regulation will continue and advertisers will more readily accept decisions of ASCI.’’

"It will helpforeign investors if some system or discipline is in place so that serious investors get a response when they voice their concerns," the NRI industrialist said.
With the expansion of the Narendra Modi Cabinet, NRI industrialist G P Hinduja on Monday expressed hope that it would give further impetus to radical changes the Prime Minister was bringing about in the Indian economy and other areas.
“The expansion and reshuffle of portfolios reflect the Prime Minister’s determination to get India going once again. He deserved to be congratulated for his choice of Ministers as well as portfolios,” the Co-Chairman of the multi-billion Hinduja Group said in a statement here.
G P Hinduja, along with S P Hinduja, Chairman of the Group said that the people of India and global investors had very high expectations from Modi’s leadership and every step he had taken since assuming office, was in the positive direction.
“Now that the Cabinet is complete the expectation will only be higher from team Modi, particularly Ministers holding key portfolios impacting on India’s economy. The Ministers concerned must now work hard to deliver and fulfil the expectations as well as carry out the task assigned to them by the PM.
“It will help the foreign investors if some system or discipline is in place so that serious investors get a response when they voice their concerns,” he said.
He said that the Prime Minister’s Office under Modi had set the example of efficiency and quick response to suggestions.
“We hope that other Ministers also emulate this example so that things move faster,” he said.
Prime Minister Modi on Sunday strengthened his government, appointing 21 new Ministers in an attempt to speed up promised economic reforms after storming to power five months ago.

When Should Nonprofits Consider Making a Transformative Changereddit
There is no "quick fix" to some nonprofit problems.  A new hire, a board retreat, another task force -- all good nonprofit "fixers" -- are simply not equal to major challenges that call for transformative change.  The evidence of more than one of the following signals suggest the necessity for different and possibly radical action:
• Lack of progress stemming from director micromanagement
• Mission creep or irrelevance of original mission
• Poor morale on board, staff and/or management
• Inadequate outcomes
• Struggle to compete with other similar organizations
• Divisive internal conflict
• Continuing financial and/or client deficits
Over the years I have seen nonprofits bravely taking on transformative change to keep their organizations alive and healthy. In every case, the process has been slow, frustrating and yes, messy! But the rewards have been significant. Here are a few "real world" examples that come to mind:
Restructuring the Governance Model - Nonprofit boards have been governed in the same ponderous community mode, with its board micromanagement for a hundred years! Since the 1980s I have been involved in helping mature nonprofits remodel the traditional and often cumbersome process, suggesting that updated structures will more effectively facilitate the important work of the organizations, i.e. to increasingly improve client outcomes. My challenges were to help find a way of allowing the board to focus solely on their responsibilities for developing policy, strategy and implementing board oversight of operations. The CEO must have full authority over operations. The new model would establish a robust assessment process and discourage both the distraction of director micromanagement and the proliferation of redundant committees. Here are some of my observations on the successes and sticking points of the transition period.
• Consensus is critical. Both a majority of board opinion leaders and CEOs need to buy into the governance transformation. Total agreement is not possible--directors may resign, preferring status quo to the uncertainty of innovation.  Some CEOs may be uncomfortable with the new responsibilities. This may require  a change at the CEO level and with his/h direct reports. Board chairs and CEOs need to delineate their respective responsibilities and invest the resulting partnership with a high level of trust.
• Nonprofits tend to be risk averse--board culture can inhibit or support change.  Once the decision has been reached to move forward in the governance revision, it is absolutely imperative that the leadership from the Board and CEO be strong and fully committed to implementing the change.
• 3-5 years is commonly the time it takes to acculturate a group of directors to a new governance model. Then it makes sense to follow up by recruiting new directors who see the advantages of the new plan.
• The good news is that restructuring has produced excellent results. Since 1980, countless nonprofits have tested its efficacy and adapted it to their own organizational needs, never returning, to my knowledge, to the old format. Establishing the new model may solve internal problems and even help provide growth opportunities. Its enhanced sense of professionalism will eventually improve services to clients and enable nonprofits to recruit and provide more meaningful experiences for directors in expediting achievement of the nonprofit's mission.
Realigning the Existing Mission
• The March of Dimes is a classic example of the need to replace an outdated mission with a statement that represents more current objectives.. Founded in 1938 by FDR to help cure polio, the discovery of the Salk vaccine in 1955 rendered the mission irrelevant. The nonprofit carefully and successfully transitioned to a revised format that focused on providing support and research for prenatal care and infant disease. It is still a vital human service today.
• Mission "creep" in a nonprofit is sometimes viewed as an abandonment of cause. Seeking funds, only tangentially related to the mission, can be dismissed as a serious transgression by those who want to maintain the status quo.  In fact, small fund developments for experimental advancement, when part of a strategic plan, can be worthwhile experiments that actually strengthen the mission.
Making Mergers that Work- Two human service nonprofits are about to converge. Each of them offers similar services. And each is suffering a decline in clienteles that can seriously impact their effectiveness. In their first exploratory meeting together, leadership personnel attempt to assess the compatibility and chemistry between their respective organizations. They will in turn bring that information back to their boards. If the report is positive, the process moves step by step as follows:
• The two committees develop a single proposal involving a myriad of details such as financial arrangements, office leases, and personnel layoffs due to duplicated services such as accounting. They decide on the new board format and identify the CEO who will head the merged organization, sometimes a fragile decision if both are competent.
• Proposal for the merger is presented to both boards. The assumption is that the vote will not be unanimous -some directors will find reason to opt out.
• Once the boards have approved of the partnership it usually takes about two years to complete the merger process.
• The results: the new organization is equipped to deliver enhanced services, have a stronger voice with peers/donors  and attract more widespread support.
• Beware the honeymoon period! Like a marriage the initial period is likely to be harmonious, But be on the alert for the cracks that appear due to cultural differences, which if they remain unhealed can eventually undo the new partnership.

Why Your Values Are Not Enoughreddit
Every organisation has values. The challenge, however, is that these are usually different from those written on the poster. To cite an infamous example, Enron's espoused values were communication, respect, excellence and, you guessed it, integrity.
The gap between espoused values and how people actually behave in organisations is largely a function of five factors:
We judge ourselves by our noble intentions, but we judge everyone else by their actions. I may consider myself high on integrity because it is part of how I see myself, but if I don't deliver on my commitments to you, you can justifiably claim that I lack integrity.
Values are a 'how to' not a 'where to'. When you say "this is our vision and these are our values" you position them as an aspiration. You might as well say "I hope we have integrity one day."
Our values are sometimes in conflict with our aspirations. We may value consistency, but if our vision is to be the most innovative company in our industry, then we have misalignment.
Living by stated values requires courage; it's usually easier to go with the flow than to be clear and unapologetic about what you stand for.
We all have different rules that determine how we experience a particular value. Usually, these rules are unconscious and/or unspoken. In order to experience the value of respect, I may have ten things that need to happen in perfect synchronicity, while you may experience respect if team members speak politely to one another.
The simplest and most effective way to bring values to life in an organization is to turn them into standards. Standards are like the agreed rules for your values.

10 Benefits for Turning Your Values into Standardsreddit
In my last post I introduced the idea that your values are not enough , and in order to bring values to life in your organisation or team you need to turn them into standards.
There are at least 10 benefits to having an agreed set of standards in your team or organisation. You;
1. Create a game you can win; you will set clear and shared expectations for behaviour, rather than encouraging others to subjectively interpret what is desired.
2. Raise accountability; you cannot say to your team, "we all need to raise our values," but you can say "we must raise our standards." Standards are a call to action.
3. Increase momentum; leaders who subjugate their formal authority to shared standards acquire a much greater power to lead - a genuine commitment from everybody to live up to those standards.
4. Encourage simplicity, speed and autonomy; you will have guideposts that clarify and accelerate decision making, so you will have less need for policies, rules and procedures.
5. Give 'soft stuff' sharp edges; standards make the intangible more tangible by creating a language for concepts that may be otherwise be fluffy or esoteric.
6. Foster solutions; when you get a group of smart people with shared standards in a room, they can solve almost any problem.
7. Eliminate friction and drag; you will readily identify those who are not a good fit for your organisation. More often than not, they will identify themselves first.
8. Define your culture; you will have a clear identity that attracts like minded people and reinforces shared expectations.
9. Build trust; you will create an environment where people give each other the benefit of the doubt and move forward together, rather than get stuck in politics and silos.
10. Reach your aspirations; you will encourage the exact behaviours you need to achieve your goals.

Shared Standards: Setting Your Stakeholders up for Successreddit
In my last two blog posts I discussed the concept of turning your values into standards and the resulting benefits of doing so.
Before you begin the process to define, cascade and embed standards, it is critical to create a setting for success with the key stakeholders for this work. Below are three critical principles to set you up for success.
Start from the assumption that you should not make any assumptions. Your audience may not have thought deeply about this issue, or may not yet feel strongly about it. You need to have a strong collective will before you begin the actual process of turning values into standards
Most organizations will have more than just a list of values; they will often have descriptions or definitions for the values. These descriptions are usually not standards. It is critical to differentiate between this content, or else your standards will just look like another list.
A description answers the question "what does this value mean?"
A standard answers the question "how would you know if I was living this value/what would you see?"
Some organizations will have programs to support their values, and some will even have champions. These types of initiatives are very helpful in communicating what the values mean, and encouraging people to move toward them. They are not, however, a substitute for senior leaders holding each other accountable to a set of shared standards.
In next week's post I will talk about how to define, cascade and embed standards in your organizations.

Minor explosion outside NIA camp officePrint
By: Express News Service | Kolkata | Posted: November 10, 2014 9:10 pm | Updated: November 10, 2014 9:49 pm
A minor explosion took place on Monday evening just outside the CRPF campus near Rajarhat where the NIA has set up its temporary office to investigate the Burdwan Blast. Police have rushed to the spot. A senior CRPF officer said there has been no damage to any property.
The explosion sounded  like a powerful cracker going off. Police are investigating the blast. An official of the Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate under whose jurisdiction the bomb exploded said the explosion was more powerful than a cracker.
K P Barui, DCDD, Bidhannagar said, “It is nothing serious. There was a sound of an explosion and the police are searching the spot.”

Jaitley defends new ministers  calls Congress  charge  baselessJaitley defends new ministers, calls Congress' charge 'baseless'
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 10, 2014
First Published: 17:54 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 20:52 IST(10/11/2014)
As the Modi government came under intense Opposition fire for induction of allegedly “tainted” ministers, finance minister Arun Jaitley the strong counter-attack, refuted all allegations and insisted that "the entire charge of Congress is baseless".
 
Congress communication department chairman Ajay Maken had cited the records of 23 ministers and particularly targeted TDP nominee YS Chowdary and BJP’s Ram Shankar Katheria. Both leaders were inducted as ministers of state last Sunday. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal questioned JP Nadda’s appointment as the new health minister, replacing Harshvardhan.
 
Upping the ante against the Congress, Jaitley said, "During the UPA government, the PM never had the last word in the Cabinet formation or its expansion. In the NDA, the last word is exclusively that of the PM.”
 
Jaitley even advised the Congress to "confine itself to quality of poor governance that they gave and compare it with the quality of governance the NDA government is giving rather than resorting to these baseless allegations".
        
Maken had sought Chowdary’s resignation as his company had allegedly defaulted on the repayment of loans worth Rs. 317.6 crore taken from the Central Bank of India. Katheria, the Congress said, has 23 criminal cases against him. The Congress also described inclusion of Giriraj Singh, MP from Nawada, as a “crisp slap to secularism.”
 
Dismissing allegations against Kathetia, Jaitley pointed out that Akhilesh Yadav government has slapped criminal cases against all BJP workers in the state. “These are cases arising out of political agitations. Not cases out of some crime or moral turpitude,” the minister added.
 
Defending Chowdary, the finance minister added that one of his many companies was making losses. “One account was in difficulty. The bank restructured it; he is paying back all the instalments (and) has a regular account today," Jaitley said.
 
The Aam Admi Party also questioned the PM’s move to replace Harshvardhan with JP Nadda in the health ministry. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “Nadda, the man who got Sanjeev Chaturvedi transferred from AIIMS, made health min? So, now modi ji will remove corruption in AIIMS thro Nadda?” Jaitley defended Nadda to say that every MP has a right to raise issues.
 
Earlier too, the Congress and the BJP had locked horns over tainted ministers. In 2004, the BJP-led Opposition didn’t even allow the introduction of ministers by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over pending charges and cases against ministers.

As three-nation trip begins tomorrow  Modi to hold 24 bilateral meetingsPrint
Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Written by Shubhajit Roy | New Delhi | Posted: November 10, 2014 9:38 pm | Updated: November 11, 2014 10:43 am
With Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to embark on his 10-day three-nation tour on Tuesday, he is likely to have at least two dozen “one-on-one meetings” with world leaders in Myanmar and Australia, sources confirmed on Monday. It will be a power-packed schedule as he goes on a diplomatic blitzkrieg and interacts with world leaders on a global stage — his first since he took charge in May this year.
Officials said Modi will meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Brey and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott during his trip to Myanmar, Australia and Fiji between November 11 and 20. He is also likely to have a “pull-aside” with US President Barack Obama, as they will be part of  both the ASEAN and G-20 summits, which are going to take place back-to-back.
Modi will have his first meeting with Li Keqiang on the sidelines of the East Asia summit at Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar, while the meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping will take place during the “informal” meeting of BRICS leaders on the fringes of the G-20 summit in Brisbane.
In Australia, as he meets Abbott, the two countries are also expected to sign a clutch of agreements on combating narcotics, social security, culture, transfer of sentenced prisoners and tourism. This will be their second meeting in two months, as Abbott was the first foreign leader to come for a state visit under the new regime.
“During the course of these summits and my bilateral visits, I will meet over 40 leaders from countries representing Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and Pacific Region, as also heads of many multilateral institutions. These meetings are taking place at a time of multiple global challenges. I look forward to seeking a global environment that supports our aspirations for economic development and a peaceful world,” the PM said in his departure statement on Monday, a day before he leaves for Nay Pyi Taw.
He said the ten-nation ASEAN community has the third largest population, the seventh largest economy, and the third fastest growing economic unit this century. “This dynamic region is our continental and maritime neighbour, linked by centuries-old ties. ASEAN is at the core of our Act East Policy and at the centre of our dream of an Asian century, characterised by cooperation and integration. I am looking forward to discussing with ASEAN leaders how to take our relationship to a new level, which will supplement our deepening bilateral ties with each member,” he said.
“No region in the world embodies so much dynamism or faces so many challenges as the region spanning the Indian Ocean, continental Asia and Pacific Ocean. And, no other forum, perhaps, has as much potential to shape this region and the world’s future as continued…

Starbucks Brings Back Eggnog Latte After OutcryEmail
Starbucks has announced it's bringing back the Eggnog Latte following a grassroots customer outcry.
A staple of the holiday menu since 1986, the chain initially kept the flavored coffee off this year to "optimize" it for new offerings like Chestnut Praline, said Starbucks spokeswoman Linda Mills.
Travis Block, a 35-year-old fireman who lives near Dallas, Texas, said he initially was "upset" when he learned the drink initially wouldn't be offered this year. "I love getting this when working," he said. 
So, like other customers, he took to Twitter sending off tweets to Starbucks and retweeting others doing the same to drum up support for bringing the beverage back.
At first his Twitter account was just another "at" symbol in the crowd of voices. Initially, he didn't think he would have any impact.
Video: Coffee shops are now selling their special holiday drinks, but you should drink in moderation as some cups can contain as much as 700 calories. TODAY’s Jenna Wolfe reports.
"Never used media this way," he said. "Just kept growing and I thought maybe this will work if we keep talking." 
But the momentum grew and others continued to join in to try to get the coffee kingpin to move its menu. An online petition gained over 2,500 signatures. Un-cheery remarks flooded Starbucks Facebook wall. A post on Starbucks' official online forum where customers can submit ideas is one of the site's most popular. Its headline reads, "BRING BACK EGGNOG!!!!!"
Starbucks got the message.
"Customers let us know holidays wouldn't be same without the Eggnog Latte," said Mills.
Mills said the eggnog is slated to reappear in all markets by November 17th. Because of variations in regional supply chains, it may appear in some areas sooner.
Block says he's "elated" to have been part of a successful groundswell.
"I can make it at home, but there is something about the atmosphere and experience getting an Eggnog Latte at Starbucks," he said.

Detroit gets court's nod to exit bankruptcy
Reuters
bankruptcy
Detroit won U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval on Friday for a road map to end its fiscal free fall and revitalise a city sinking under a huge debt load and dysfunctional government.
Judge Steven Rhodes confirmed the city’s plan to shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations and plough $1.7 billion into improvements, finding it both fair to creditors and feasible to implement.
“The city has worked honestly, diligently, and tirelessly to accomplish precisely the remedy that the bankruptcy code establishes for municipalities,” Mr. Rhodes said.
He acknowledged the anger the bankruptcy fuelled among many Detroit residents and urged them to look forward.

Lie  Cheat and Steal: What Some Will Do for a Bottle of BourbonEmail
This week, in a nod to hopes for bipartisanship after Republicans won control of the Senate, President Barack Obama said he would enjoy drinking Kentucky bourbon with Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. He probably wasn’t thinking it would be in Jell-O shot form.
People are driven to lie, cheat — even steal — to get their hands on a bottle of cult favorite Pappy Van Winkle bourbon, which retails for $249 a bottle. On the resale market it can fetch nearly $10,000. Extraordinary demand and scarce supply have led to extraordinary measures, including a heist from the Kentucky distillery last year. Liquor stores and bars scramble for their “allocation,” an industry practice where scant supplies are apportioned across markets. But in order to get a better share, retail outlets say they’re forced to move greater volume of a distributor’s lower-end liquors.
The divvying up in the allocation system frustrates retailers, but the cause is straightforward. Bourbon's explosive rise in popularity, compounded by increased exports, means there's just not enough to go around — even though production has increased 150 percent since 1999 (up to 1.2 million barrels in 2013). More than 162 million liters of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey were sold last year in the United States, and to handle demand nationwide distributors have to reallocate, shipping more to bigger markets where supply is tight. 
Dana McMahan
Jeremy Johnson, who opened cocktail lounge Meta in downtown Louisville last year, served Pappy Van Winkle 15 Year in JELL-O shot form.
Jeremy Johnson, who opened cocktail lounge Meta in downtown Louisville last year, took a different approach with his first Pappy allocation this year. Pouring the first shot in what could be the Great Bourbon Rebellion of 2014, on Thursday night he served Pappy Van Winkle 15 Year in Jell-O shot form.
“[Allocation] has  gotten out of hand,” Johnson told NBC. “I have to literally ask [the distributor] to sell to me. I don't want to be a smart aleck about it, but you know I can’t sit back and not poke a little fun at it. This is a healthy way to let a little aggression out.”
Johnson posted his plans on the bar's Facebook page at noon Thursday. “I got so many calls I decided I'd better double the batch,” he said.
On a weeknight more crowded than a busy Saturday, Johnson said he sold out — 100 Old Fashioned cocktail Jell-O shots at $10 each. Some patrons accompanied their shot with a $30 pour of the bourbon, straight.
Dana McMahan
The Meta cocktail lounge
In the heart of bourbon country, drinkers were having a good time, though purists on Twitter dubbed the idea appalling and infuriating .
“It is like blasphemy,” said Marsha Lynch, 51, a pastry chef who was first in line for the shot. “It's like a panda bear popsicle, but I wanted to say I'd done it.”
Kim Sorise, a 41-year-old middle school English teacher who deejays at Meta, came in to show her support. She's frustrated with Pappy mania. “Now Kentuckians can't even go in the store and get it,” she said.
'It felt like a slap in the face'
A local liquor store owner shares her frustration. Todd Antz runs Keg Liquors in Clarksville, Indiana,  north of Louisville. His annual allocation has dropped over the last few years from several cases to his latest shipment: three bottles of 12-year-old Van Winkle. “I was like, 'You've got to be kidding me,'” he said. “I looked over and saw a couple  displays for Sazerac [the distiller's parent company] and told my employees to tear them down.”  Antz texted photos of the tear-down to his sales rep, though he's not without sympathy.
“You feel for Sazerac,” he said. “It's not like 20 years ago they realized they better lay down a lot of barrels.” But Antz says his family has supported the brand through the shop's 40 years in business. “It felt like a slap in the face because you knew that stuff was going places that haven't supported them a fraction of that time.”
Antz's rep advised him that allocation is based on their total purchases across the product line. But the things he'd have to sell for a better allocation were “dogs,” Antz said. “They wouldn't sell. It just seems disingenuous that they’ll hang these products over your head in order to get a handful [of Pappy].”
The distiller, Buffalo Trace, has no control, said spokesperson Amy Preske. “We allocate by state, but it’s up to the distributor to determine who gets what beyond that. As far as the shortages, that’s very simple. We didn’t make enough.” Preske declined to comment on the Jell-O shots. Representatives from Republic National Distributing Company, the sole distributor for Pappy in Kentucky, did not respond to a request for comment.
Antz expects his allocation of the sought-after bottles to eventually fall to nothing. However, “Fifteen years from now when the bubble bursts and there's a glut of Pappy Van Winkle, I'll see it back in the store,” he said. “They'll have no choice but to sell it  to me.”

By Michael Georgy and Phil Stewart
BAGHDAD/WASHINGTON Nov 8 (Reuters) - U.S. air strikes  destroyed an Islamic State convoy near the Iraqi city of Mosul  but U.S. officials said on Saturday it was unclear whether the  group's top commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been in any of  the 10 targeted vehicles.
Colonel Patrick Ryder, a Central Command spokesman, said the  U.S. military had reason to believe that the convoy was carrying  leaders of Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot which controls  large chunks of Iraq and Syria.
The convoy consisted of 10 Islamic State armed trucks.
"I can confirm that coalition aircraft did conduct a series  of air strikes yesterday evening in Iraq against what was  assessed to be a gathering of ISIL leaders near Mosul," said  Ryder, using another name for Islamic State.
"We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was  among those present."
Islamic State had been changing its strategy since the air  strikes began, switching to lower profile vehicles to avoid  being targeted, according to residents of towns the group holds.
A Mosul morgue official said 50 bodies of Islamic State  militants were brought to the facility after the air strike.
Mosul, northern Iraq's biggest city, was overrun on June 10  in an offensive that saw vast parts of Iraq's Sunni regions fall  to the Islamic State and allied groups.
A month later a video posted online purported to show the  reclusive Baghdadi preaching at Mosul's grand mosque.
Earlier on Saturday, Al-Hadath television channel said  U.S.-led air strikes targeted a gathering of Islamic State  leaders in a town near the Syrian border, possibly including  Baghdadi.
Iraqi security officials were not immediately available for  comment on the report from the station, part of Saudi-owned  al-Arabiya television, but two witnesses told Reuters an air  strike targeted a house where senior Islamic State officers were  meeting, near the western Iraqi border town of al-Qaim.
Al-Hadath said dozens of people were killed and wounded in  the strike in al-Qaim, and that Baghdadi's fate was unclear.
Mahmoud Khalaf, a member of Anbar's Provincial Council, also  said there were air strikes in al-Qaim. He gave no details.
The U.S.-led coalition carried out air strikes near al-Qaim  overnight, destroying an Islamic State armored vehicle and two  checkpoints run by the group, Ryder said.
BOMBINGS
The hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate  has helped return sectarian violence in Iraq to the dark days of  2006-2007, the peak of its civil war.
It has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab  militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could  allow them to evade detection in Western airports.
On Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in  Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources  said, bringing to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi  capital and the western city of Ramadi.
An attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in  Anbar killed five soldiers. "Before the explosion, the  checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the  suicide humvee bomber attacked it," said a police official.
There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but  they resembled operations carried out by Islamist militants.
In the town of Baquba, 65 km (40 miles) northeast of  Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb  targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security  sources said.
U.S. TROOPS
Western and Iraqi officials say air strikes are not enough  to defeat the Sunni insurgents and Iraq must improve the  performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat.
President Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more  troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on  the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis.
The Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional  U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after  Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state  television reported.
The United States spent $25 billion on the Iraqi military  during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003  and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda.
Washington wants Iraq's Shi'ite-led government to revive an  alliance with Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province which helped  U.S. Marines defeat al Qaeda.
Such an alliance would face a more formidable enemy in  Islamic State, which has more firepower and funding, and it may  not be possible because of mistrust between Sunni tribes of  Anbar and the Baghdad government.

FPIs infuse Rs 5 200 cr in Indian capital mkt in aweekFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Overseas investors have pumped in close to Rs 5,200 crore in capital markets in first week of the month on positive global cues coupled with government’s reforms agenda.
The net investments by foreign investors in the equity market were Rs 4,412 crore (USD 718 million) from November 3-7, while they infused a net amount of Rs 765 crore (USD 125 million) in the debt market during the period, taking the total to Rs 5,177 crore (USD 843 million), as per the latest data.
Market analysts said that overseas investors (foreign Institutional Investors, sub-accounts or foreign portfolio investors) are betting on hopes that European Central Bank (ECB) may announce stimulus measures to revive growth in Eurozone economies.
Besides, Japan has already announced plan to expand its additional stimulus package.
They believe that some of this excess liquidity will come to India compared to other emerging market countries.
Moreover, foreign investors are betting on India on account of the reforms agenda of the Central government.
Since the beginning of the year, foreign investors have made a net investment of Rs 2.23 lakh crore (USD 37 billion) into the country’s securities market.
This includes a net investment of Rs 86,678 crore in equities and Rs 1.37 lakh crore into debt market.
The strong inflows in the recent months have taken the cumulative net investments of FIIs into India to USD 208 billion, while their investments in rupee terms is Rs 10.14 lakh crore.
This is based on the data since November 1992 when the FIIs began investing into Indian markets and includes about USD 160 billion investments into equities and further about USD 47 billion in debt markets.
From the beginning of June, FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors) along with sub-accounts and qualified foreign investors have been clubbed together by market regulator Sebi to create a new investor category called Foreign Portfolio Investors.

Gold  silver bounce back on robust buyingsupportGold futures price falls on global cues
Both the precious metals staged a strong comeback from their multi-year lows at the domestic bullion market today as jewellery stockists and investors went on a buying spree following a sharp rally in precious metals worldwide.
The domestic bullion market went into a tailspin and witnessed a near-term breakdown spooked by a massive rout in global commodity arena in the aftermath of the Fed’s decision to wind down its historic bond-buying programme.
Though the overall global environment remains complicated against the backdrop of interest rates uncertainty, strong retail jewellery demand for marriages as well as good investment offtake at prevailing levels supported the sharp pullback, a bullion trader said.
Keeping with the general trend, silver also trimmed most of its recent losses and closed above the Rs 36,000 per kg mark on heavy speculative demand.
Standard gold (99.5 purity) recovered by Rs 440 to conclude at Rs 25,950 per 10 grams from yesterday’s closing level of Rs 25,510.
Pure gold (99.9 purity) also recouped with the same margin to end at Rs 26,100 per 10 grams compared to Rs 25,660.
Silver (.999 fineness) shot up by a hefty Rs 750 to finish at Rs 36,500 per kg against Rs 35,750 yesterday.
On the global front, the yellow metal snapped its seven-session losing streak and recovered sharply as investors covered short positions after the metal hit a 4-1/2 year low following a retreat in the US dollar.
Gold for December delivery climbed to settle at USD 1,169.80 an ounce on the Comex division of the COMEX late yesterday, while silver gained to end at USD 15.71 an ounce.

Both the indices end marginally higher after touching newpeakFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Both the indices, sensex and nifty, ended marginally higher after touching life-time high in a truncated trading week.
This was on strong buying mainly in Realty, Healthcare, Banking and IT sectors despite mild profit-booking from operators in Metal, Power, Auto and Consumer Durable.
The Sensex conquered the 28,000 mark for the first time on expectations of more reforms by the Modi government and a rate cut by the RBI.
Markets were enthused after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised reforms in labour, land acquisition and insurance laws and expressed readiness to look at privatisation of some loss-making public sector companies.
Strong foreign capital inflows coupled with higher European cues mainly boosted the domestic market sentiment, even as services sector activity in India stagnated during October amid weaker growth of new orders as per an HSBC survey.
“The fall in crude oil prices will have a positive impact on, among other things, inflation….it will embolden the RBI to cut rates,” said HDFC Securities in a note.
The sensex resumed higher at 27,943.04 and shot up further to an all-time high of 28,010.39 on initial strong buying. However, it declined afterwards to 27,739.56 before concluding the week at 27,868.33, showing a marginal gain of 2.70 points or 0.01 pct.
The CNX 50-share Nifty also moved by 14.80 points or 0.18 per cent to finish at 8,337.00 after touching an all-time high level of 8,365.55 during the week.

H1 Gold Jewellery  Coin Exports Rise 22%Government May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: Exports of gold jewellery, coins and medallions rose 22 per cent to Rs 33,594 crore in the fiscal first half of 2014-15, mainly due to the 80:20 scheme by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The Reserve Bank had in August last year allowed under the 80:20 scheme nominated agencies to import gold on the condition that 20 per cent, or one-fifth, of the import would be exported.
To boost value-added gold exports, the RBI in May this year eased gold import norms by allowing select trading houses, in addition to already permitted banks, to procure the precious metal.
According to the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), the country exported gold jewellery and coins worth Rs 33,594 crore in April-September period this year, up 22 per cent from Rs 27,551 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.
Of total gold exports, jewellery was worth Rs 27,530 crore and coins/medallions were worth Rs 6,064 crore in the review period.
However, shipment of gold jewellery from Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as well as Export Processing Zones (EPZs) declined during the period under review.
Gold jewellery worth Rs 11,299.67 crore was exported from SEZs and EPZs during April-September of this year, as against Rs 14,578.72 crore in the same period corresponding year.
In fiscal year 2013-14, the country had exported gold jewellery and coins worth Rs 70,000 crore.
India is the world's largest gold consumer and meets its entire demand of almost 900 tonnes through imports.

Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
London: Oil explorer Cairn Energy has made a second oil discovery off the coast of Senegal which bears similar characteristics as a nearby oil find the British-based company made last month.
The SNE-1 well located around 100 kilometres off the coast of the west African country may hold 150-670 million barrels of recoverable resources, Cairn Energy said.
The oil explorer is the operator and owns a 40 percent stake in three blocks off the coast of Senegal, while other stakeholders include oil major ConocoPhillips, which owns 35 per cent.

Car Sales Growth Likely to Miss Target in FY15: SIAMGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: Car sales are set to fall below the earlier growth target for FY15 set by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
Car sales growth this fiscal year is likely to be below 5 per cent, Sugato Sen, deputy director-general, SIAM, told reporters on Monday.
In August, the industry body said it expected domestic car sales to grow between 5 and 10 per cent, helped by an improved sentiment after the Narendra Modi government took office in May following a victory in the general elections.
"We are not being able to sustain only by creating positive sentiment," said Mr Sen. "Unless the real economy starts growing... we may not see a very robust growth in the auto sector, especially the passenger vehicle market."
Sale of passenger vehicles, which includes cars and utility vehicles, fell 7.5 per cent in October to 221,151 units from a year ago, breaking a consecutive rise for five months. Passenger car sales were lower by 2.6 per cent.
Car sales are expected to rise this fiscal year after falling for two consecutive years, says SIAM.

Bond Market Sees Rate Cuts Even as RBI Talks Tough on InflationYou are here: Home Economy
Bond Market Sees Rate Cuts Even as RBI Talks Tough on Inflation
Reuters | Updated On: November 10, 2014 08:54 (IST)
More Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
Mumbai: The rally in Indian bonds is providing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan an unexpected gift: Falling borrowing costs are starting to provide the benefits of lower interest rates without him actually having to ease monetary policy.
The bond rally - and the lower yields that result - comes as the consumer price index eased to 6.46 per cent in September.
That was the lowest since the series was introduced in January 2012 - a major morale boost for the fixed-income market and its legendary fear of inflation.
Investors are also more confident on the economy after a sharp turnaround in the rupee, the best Asian performer so far in 2014, gaining about 0.7 per cent to 61.53 to the dollar, and bucking a falling trend among its peers.
Despite no change in interest rates, India's largest lender, State Bank of India, last week became among the latest to lower deposit rates, often a precursor to lower lending rates, something some banks have already done for certain consumer loans.
Corporate bond yields have fallen sharply, making it 55 basis points (bps) cheaper for companies to issue bonds than a couple of months ago, bankers said. A 10-year AAA corporate bond is trading at around 8.75 per cent compared with 9.30 per cent just a few months ago.
That is working in Dr Rajan's favour, easing pressure on the RBI to immediately cut rates and allowing him to uphold his hawkish reputation on inflation.
"There is an anticipation of easing by RBI materialising earlier than later and that is triggering the rate cuts by banks and softening in market yields," said Siddhartha Sanyal, India economist at Barclays in Mumbai.
Bond markets are now pricing in a cut in the key repo rate to 8 per cent as early as the RBI's next meeting on December 2 or in February - whereas previously expectations were for an easing in the second quarter of 2015.
As a result, the 10-year bond yield hit this week a 15-month low of 8.19 per cent. The one-year interest rate swap - an indicator of policy rates - fell nearly 37 bps last month, the biggest monthly fall in a year and is now trading at 7.96 per cent.
Meanwhile, cash conditions remain loose, allowing lenders to lower deposit and lending rates because they can access short-term funds more cheaply.
State Bank of India last week lowered some of its deposit rates by 100 bps, having already cut its home loan rates by about 15 bps in August.
Caution
For market borrowing costs to fall before a cut in official rates is a marked change in a country where banks often take months to react to changes in official rates.
This shift means any RBI rate cut would be passed through to the domestic economy much faster this time around.
That is critical, given that boosting credit growth, which touched a 13-year low in September, is a key plank in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to revive investment. Lower market borrowing costs also reduce pressure on the RBI to cut interest rates at a time when the economy has suffered from two consecutive years of below 5 per cent growth, a relatively low pace for India.
Dr Rajan has argued repeatedly that economic growth can only revive by defeating inflation. The former International Monetary Fund economist has tried to do that by raising interest rates three times since September.
"Lower interest rates are good for growth. If the reform process by the government, which has already started, continues and is accompanied by lower policy interest rates, then the combination will help growth pick up faster," said Sanjay Mathur, head of economic research for non-Japan Asia at Royal Bank of Scotland in Singapore.
Union Bank of India Ltd, for example, said it was already prepared to lower lending rates after recently reducing deposit rates by 25-30 bps for some maturities to 8.75 per cent.
"Once RBI cuts the repo rate, banks are likely to follow with base rate cuts to push credit," said Arun Tiwari, chairman and managing director at Union Bank of India.
The worry for markets is an unexpected pick-up in inflation, such as via a sudden surge in crude oil prices, that would keep interest rates high for much longer than currently expected, given Rajan's intent to get CPI to 6 per cent by January 2016.
The RBI said after its September 30 policy meeting that it expects inflation to pick up by year-end as the base effect wanes. Food prices also typically rise in the run-up to the monsoon months.
"In India we have seen this play out several times: policy tightens, inflation declines, policy is loosened in response which spikes inflation. I think RBI wants to avoid repeating this mistake," said Jahangir Aziz, chief emerging-Asia economist at JP Morgan.

Principles for Effective MeetingsLast week I discussed why effective meetings are so important , today I'd like to expand on that by providing some principles for making your meetings more effective.
Before you lead/engage in a meeting, ensure you:
Can take at least one decision; if you are having a meeting solely to share information, consider whether you can share that information another way.
Create a setting for success. There are five critical questions to be clear on;
Purpose; why are we spending our valuable time together?
Outcomes; what does success look like?
Decisions; what do we need to decide?
Questions; what are the questions we need to answer while we are together?
Impact; how do I/we want people to feel at the end of this meeting?
Circulate key content for the meeting well in advance; otherwise, people will spend their time in the meeting reading and reacting under pressure, rather than providing considered insights and suggestions.
Limit the number of attendees. Every member of a meeting should ask themselves;
Why am I really attending (contribution, habit, lack of trust, control, other)?
What is my specific contribution to the meeting?
Can I provide my input in advance and catch up on the outcomes afterward?
During the meeting, ensure you:
Set standards for the meeting; agree them at the start and measure them at the end to encourage the behaviors that you need to be successful.
Focus on "So what" and "Now what"; effective meetings spend no more than 15% of the time in "What" (description of the problem, issue or challenge at hand), up to 70% in "So what" (the insights, meaning and potential implications of the situation), leaving only 15% needed for "Now what" (the actions and next steps).
Work through a natural hierarchy of questions; structure the meeting from biggest to smallest question so that you build momentum from one decision to the next and avoid doubling back. For example, asking "what is the best strategy?" should follow "what is the outcome we want?"
Have rules for technology; use electronic gadgets to enable outcomes, not to divert or distract people from the agenda.
Lead with energy and end on schedule; with too much time, even the most unshakable decision will be reconsidered.
Agree next actions, responsibilities and messages; these basic disciplines encourage material outcomes from the meeting, and positively affect those downstream.

10 Reasons Why Effective Meetings Are So Importantreddit
"Our leadership meetings are a good use of time."
For 15 years now, we have tested this idea with more than 5,000 leaders, from 150 different organizations, across four continents. On average, these organizations score no more than 5/10. In other words, the best we can say is that the most important meetings in our organizations, attended by our most senior people, are half as effective as they could or should be.
The costs of ineffective meetings are huge. We waste the most important assets we have as leaders; discretionary time, money and talent. At a time of intense global competition, where the quality and speed of decisions can mean the difference between success and failure, 5/10 is not sustainable.
There are at least 10 benefits to increasing the effectiveness of your meetings. You:
1. Increase discretionary time; what would you do next week if you suddenly and sustainably got back 20% of your diary?
2. Reduce stress; you will get more done, in less time, with less effort.
3. Accelerate innovation; you will increase the quality, volume and frequency of strategic insight.
4. Increase speed to market; you will respond more quickly to customer needs and market opportunities.
5. Decrease cost; you will likely reduce the number of meetings and, in doing so, will dramatically reduce direct and indirect costs.
6. Increase engagement and teamwork; you will create meetings that people want to attend, and they will bring greater levels of passion and commitment every day.
7. Reinforce your desired culture; meetings are carriers of organizational culture. When meetings become demonstrably more effective, they spread a virus of energy and optimism across multiple dimensions of your organization.
8. Increase accountability; you will create an environment where more people contribute to decisions more often, resulting in higher levels of personal ownership.
9. Provide a sense of purpose, every day; vision, mission and values statements can sometimes be viewed cynically by staff members, but productive meetings bring your aspirations to life every day.
10. Accelerate toward your aspirations; you will direct all available energy toward your goals.
Over the coming weeks I will discuss how to shift the effectiveness of your most important meetings.

Principles to Define  Cascade and Embed StandardsIn recent posts I have established 'Why Your Values Are Not Enough' , the '10 Benefits for Turning Your Values Into Standards' and how to set your stakeholders up for success with a set of shared standards. But how do you define, cascade and embed those standards? Today I will provide some principles for doing just that.
To define powerful shared standards, ensure they:
Serve the aspirations and compliment the strategy.
Are simple and explicit. Avoid clichés and management jargon.
Can be a reference point for critical decisions.
Make a call to action.
Represent the critical few, with the biggest potential impact.
Represent the minimum expected behavior, not an aspiration.
Balance raising the bar, with creating a game you can win.
To cascade the standards, ensure:
Senior leaders are living, breathing role models first. Until this happens, there is no legitimacy in asking others to commit.
They are cascaded via 'in-tact' teams, rather than cross functionally. This encourages much higher levels of mutual accountability.
Teams in the cascade are allowed some room to define their own standards, within agreed boundaries. This encourages ownership and relevance.
Some level of central coordination to ensure that particular business units or teams aren't left behind.
To embed the standards:
Use them to set up and close meetings.
Use any discussion of the aspirations to create a connection to the standards.
Reflect them in your people and performance systems. If the standards and systems are in conflict, the systems will win.
Measure them for individuals and teams, and create forums for open and honest feedback among peers.
Hire, promote and fire in alignment with the standards. To emphasize this point, the single most powerful way to embed standards in an organization is to remove a senior leader who is getting results but not living the standards.
Review and revitalize them periodically to raise the bar.

00:01  Ever sense of the Internet was created it's been organized
00:04  around basic principles of openness. Fairness and freedom. There's no gatekeepers
00:10  deciding which sites you get access. There note holed roads on
00:14  the information superhighway. This set of principles. Idea of net neutrality.
00:20  Has unleashed the power of the Internet and given innovators the

00:29  we know. That's one way out plan to keep the Internet
00:33  free and open. And that's why I'm urging the Federal Communications
00:36  Commission to do everything they can't protect net neutrality for every.
00:41  They should make it clear that whether using computer phone or
00:44  tablet. Internet providers have a legal obligation not to block or
00:48  limit your access to a website. Cable companies can't decide which
00:53  online sports you can shop. Which streaming services you can use.
00:57  And they can't let any company pay for priority over its
01:00  competitors. To put these protections in place I'm asking the FCC
01:05  to reclassify Internet service under title to along known as the
01:08  telecommunications act. In plain English I'm asking them to recognize that
01:13  for most Americans the Internet has become an essential part of
01:16  everyday communication and every day. FCC is an independent agency and
01:21  ultimately this decision is there's a law. But the public has

01:33  sites they use. Americans make their voices heard and standing up

President Obama came out strongly Monday for the concept of net neutrality, saying that "an open Internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life."
In a written statement, Obama  asked the Federal Communications Commission to "create a new set of rules protecting net neutrality," and to ensure that phone and cable companies will not be able "to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online."
The FCC is nearing a decision.
Net neutrality supporters hailed the president's comments as a victory for Internet users and free speech advocates. Critics, including major corporations and Republican lawmakers, called it an overreaction that will lead to lawsuits, worse service, and higher prices.
Tom Wheeler, the Obama-appointed chairman of the FCC, said that "like the president, I believe that the Internet must remain an open platform for free expression, innovation, and economic growth. We both oppose Internet fast lanes. The Internet must not advantage some to the detriment of others."
Wheeler said the commission would enter Obama's submission into the record of its proceedings, and would continue to hear "from all stakeholders, including the public (and) members of Congress of both parties."
In the statement — issued while Obama is in China for an Asian economic summit — the president noted that "the FCC is an independent agency, and ultimately this decision is theirs alone."

In classified briefings Oct. 22 and Nov. 7, the U.S. Postal Service told members of Congress that it had been hacked.
The service made the information public Monday.
The Washington Post reported China may have been involved in the cyberattack, citing anonymous sources. USA TODAY was unable to confirm the report.
Postal Service spokeswoman Sue Brennan told USA TODAY the "issue is still under investigation."
In its statement, the post office said some USPS computers were hacked and some employee information was compromised.
Information about people who called in to the post office's  Customer Care center was also compromised.
The service's customer website, usps.com, was  not affected, the statement said.
"The  intrusion is limited in scope, and all operations of the Postal Service are  functioning normally," said David  Partenheimer, media relations manager for the U.S. Postal Service.
In a letter sent Monday, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., cited the classified briefings, which were made to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He asked for more information from Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe.
Cummings asked for a description of the cyberattack and how it was first discovered, as well as what actions Donahoe took after learning about it.
The  post office is investigating the incident. The investigation is being led by  the FBI and other federal and postal investigatory agencies.
Employee information  that might have been compromised included personally identifiable information  about employees, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers,  addresses, beginning and end dates of employment, emergency contact  information and other information.
Roughly 800,000 employees were affected by the intrusion, the service said.
If indeed China is behind the attack, it's likely part of an attempt to gain more information about U.S. government, said Edward Ferrara, an analyst with Forrester, a technology research company.
Employee data is also very helpful for future attacks.
"If a relatively high-level employee at the post office starts sending out phishing attacks from a .gov address, it's a possible stepping stone for attacks to get information of more value elsewhere," Ferrara said.
Cash registers and point-of-sale terminals in post offices, as well as the website usps.com where customers pay for  services with credit and debit cards, were not touched by the incident.
There is no evidence any customer credit card information from retail or  online purchases such as Click-N-Ship, the Postal Store, PostalOne!, change  of address or other services was compromised, the service said.
Also  possibly affected were call center data for customers who contacted the service's  Customer Care Center by telephone or e-mail between Jan. 1, 2014, and Aug.  16, 2014, Partenheimer said.
According to the Postal Service's website, the Customer  Care Center handled 83 million inquiries in 2013.

Why the Perry indictment should be dismissed: count I (veto)  immunityBy Eugene Volokh November 10 Follow @volokhc
As I noted below , Jim Ho and Prerak Shah (Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher) and I have filed an amicus brief on behalf of 14 scholars, former judges, and former prosecutors (liberal, conservative, and moderate) arguing that the indictment of Gov. Rick Perry should be dismissed. (For a refresher on the indictment itself, see here .) You can read the brief in PDF form here , but I thought I’d also post the full text on the blog. Here is the immunity argument on count I, which focuses on Perry’s veto of appropriations for the Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg’s office; I’ve posted separately on the separation of powers argument on count I , and I’ll post shortly on count II , which focuses on Perry’s threat of the veto.
* * *
B. Governor Perry Cannot Be Prosecuted for His Veto, Because He Is Entitled to Absolute Legislative Immunity for Any Exercise of His Veto Power.
Count I also suffers from a separate yet equally fatal flaw:  a Governor has absolute legislative immunity from any prosecution based on the exercise of his veto power.
1.         Legislative immunity is a common law doctrine that flows from the Speech or Debate Clauses of the Texas and U.S. Constitutions.  See In re Perry, 60 S.W.3d 857, 859 (Tex. 2001) (citing U.S. Const. art. I, § 6; Tex. Const. art. III, § 21).  It declares that “individuals acting in a legislative capacity are immune from liability for those actions.”  Id.
The reason for this legislative immunity is simple, as the U.S. Supreme Court has explained, and the Texas Supreme Court has endorsed:
“[T]he threat of liability can create perverse incentives that operate to inhibit officials in the proper performance of their duties.  In many contexts, government officials are expected to make decisions that are impartial or imaginative, and that above all are informed by considerations other than the personal interests of the decisionmaker.  Because government officials are engaged by definition in governing, their decisions will often have adverse effects on other persons.  When officials are threatened with personal liability for acts taken pursuant to their official duties, they may well be induced to act with an excess of caution or otherwise to skew their decisions in ways that result in less than full fidelity to the objective and independent criteria that ought to guide their conduct.”
Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219, 223 (1988)).
And for precisely those same reasons, the motive behind a legislative act — be it partisan, personal, or parochial — is utterly irrelevant to the privilege of legislative immunity:
The claim of an unworthy purpose does not destroy the privilege.  Legislators are immune from deterrents to the uninhibited discharge of their legislative duty, not for their private indulgence but for the public good.  One must not expect uncommon courage even in legislators.  The privilege would be of little value if they could be subjected to the cost and inconvenience and distractions of a trial upon a conclusion of the pleader, or to the hazard of a judgment against them based upon a jury’s speculation as to motives.
Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 377 (1951).  See also Perry, 60 S.W.3d at 859-60 (“The legislative immunity doctrine recognizes that it is not consonant with our scheme of government for a court to inquire into the motives of legislators.”) (quotations and citation omitted).
2.         Notably, legislative immunity extends to any official who is acting in a legislative capacity, whether or not the official is a member of the Legislature.  For example, the Texas Supreme Court has held that legislative immunity protects the Attorney General and the Comptroller when they perform “legislative functions” as members of the Legislative Redistricting Board.  Id.  “Courts have extended the legislative immunity doctrine beyond federal and state legislators to other individuals performing legitimate legislative functions,” such as mayors, city council vice-presidents, and others.  Id. at 860.  Indeed, “[a]ctions to which courts have extended absolute legislative immunity include a mayor’s veto of an ordinance passed by a city council.”  Camacho v. Samaniego, 954 S.W.2d 811, 823 (Tex. App. — El Paso 1997, pet. denied) (citing Hernandez v. City of Lafayette, 643 F.2d 1188, 1194 (5th Cir. 1981)).  “[W]hen the mayor of a municipality vetoes an ordinance passed by the city’s legislative body, he performs a legislative function and is entitled to absolute immunity from a civil suit complaining about actions taken in his legislative capacity.”  Hernandez, 643 F.2d at 1194.
Just as a mayoral veto is a legislative act subject to legislative immunity, so too is a gubernatorial veto.  Texas law is clear that a gubernatorial veto is a legislative act, not an executive act.  See, e.g., Jessen Assocs., Inc. v. Bullock, 531 S.W.2d 593, 598 (Tex. 1975); Fulmore v. Lane, 140 S.W. 405, 411 (Tex. 1911); Pickle v. McCall, 24 S.W. 265, 268 (Tex. 1893).  So Governor Perry is immune from liability for his veto.
This immunity from liability applies to criminal prosecutions as well as civil suits based on legislative activity.  Indeed, the core principle behind legislative immunity is to enable our “representatives to execute the functions of their office without fear of prosecutions, civil or criminal.”  Tenney, 341 U.S. at 373-74 (emphasis added).  As courts have recognized, the “level of intimidation against a local legislator arising from the threat of a criminal proceeding is at least as great as the threat from a civil suit,” so “the privilege or immunity enjoyed by local legislators should be extended to criminal proceedings.”  State v. Holton, 997 A.2d 828, 845, 856 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2010), aff’d, 24 A.3d 678 (Md. 2011) (quotations and citation omitted).
[Footnote: See also Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306, 312-13 (1973) (“Congressmen . . . are immune from liability for their actions within the ‘legislative sphere,’ even though their conduct, if performed in other than legislative contexts, would in itself be unconstitutional or otherwise contrary to criminal or civil statutes.”) (citation omitted); D’Amato v. Superior Court, 167 Cal. App. 4th 861, 871 (Cal. Ct. App. 2008) (“The district attorney . . . contends immunity applies only to civil suits, and does not extend to criminal prosecutions.  We disagree.”); Dublin v. State, 742 N.E.2d 232, 236 (Ohio Ct. App. 2000) (“‘legislative privilege’ embodies . . . substantive immunity from civil and criminal liability”); State v. Neufeld, 926 P.2d 1325, 1337 (Kan. 1996) (“[I]f a legislator’s conduct falls within a legitimate legislative sphere, legality of the conduct is not a primary concern.”).]
So Count I presents a particularly straightforward application of legislative immunity.  A conviction under Section 39.02(a)(2) requires an inquiry into Governor Perry’s subjective state of mind.  See Tex. Penal Code § 39.02(a)(2) (requiring “intent to harm”).  But “it is not consonant with our scheme of government for a court to inquire into the motives of legislators.”  Perry, 60 S.W.3d at 859-60 (quotations and citation omitted).  “If the motives for a legislator’s legislative activities are suspect, the constitution requires that the remedy be public exposure; if the suspicions are sustained, the sanction is to be administered either at the ballot box or in the legislature itself.”  State v. Dankworth, 672 P.2d 148, 152 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).  See also Tenney, 341 U.S. at 377-78 (“The claim of an unworthy purpose does not destroy the privilege . . . In times of political passion, dishonest or vindictive motives are readily attributed to legislative conduct and as readily believed.  Courts are not the place for such controversies.”).
[Footnote: See also United States v. Dowdy, 479 F.2d 213, 266 (4th Cir. 1973) (“Once it was determined that the legislative function . . . was apparently being performed, the propriety and the motivation for the action taken, as well as the detail of the acts performed, are immune from judicial inquiry.’”); Irons v. R.I. Ethics Comm’n, 973 A.2d 1124, 1131 (R.I. 2009) (“‘[A]s long as [a legislator’s] challenged actions, stripped of all considerations of intent and motive, were legislative in character, the doctrine of absolute legislative immunity protects them from such claims.’”) (citation omitted); D’Amato, 167 Cal. App. 4th at 869 (“courts cannot inquire into the impetus or motive behind legislative action”) (quotations and citation omitted).]
3.         The special prosecutor argues that legislative immunity does not apply to a criminal prosecution of a Governor’s exercise of the veto power, relying heavily on a single district judge’s decisions in United States v. Mandel, 415 F. Supp. 997 (D. Md. 1976), and United States v. Mandel, 415 F. Supp. 1025 (D. Md. 1976).  But those cases are inapposite.
First, a crucial aspect of Mandel is not present here.  The district judge in that case reasoned that “the rationale for immunity from criminal prosecution is wholly lacking” because prosecution came from the executive branch.  Mandel, 415 F. Supp. at 1031.  As the judge explained, “[t]he executive has no reason to fear for its independence as a co-equal branch of government as a consequence of any criminal prosecution brought by itself.”  Id.
But the executive branch in Texas is not unitary.  The Governor and the Attorney General are separately elected.  Moreover, the power to bring criminal prosecutions in Texas is divided between the Attorney General and local district attorneys, with the bulk of the authority in the hands of district attorneys.  So the chief executive of Texas does have reason to fear for its independence as a consequence of criminal prosecutions brought by officials wholly outside of his authority, as evidenced by this very case.
Second, Governor Mandel was not entitled to legislative immunity in any event.  Mandel concerned the federal prosecution of a state official.  As the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear, legislative immunity does not apply in that context, because immunity derives from the separations of powers within a sovereign, not between sovereigns.  See United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360, 370 (1980).  Mandel did not involve a state prosecution of a state official and is thus inapplicable to this case.
The special prosecutor also cites Jorgensen v. Blagojevich, 811 N.E.2d 652 (Ill. 2004), and Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681 (1997), to argue that legislative immunity should not apply in this case.  But neither of those cases even remotely supports that position.
Jorgensen involved suing a governor in his official capacity to declare an official act unconstitutional.  It had nothing to do with holding a governor personally liable, either civilly or criminally, for an official act.  Obviously Governor Perry can be sued in his official capacity when a plaintiff is seeking to declare a government action unlawful.  That happens all the time.  But that has nothing to do with trying to hold him personally liable for a legislative act, as is the case here.  Indeed, Jorgensen itself explicitly acknowledged this distinction:
We note, moreover, that the Judges have not sought to hold the Governor personally liable for his actions, nor are they attempting to force him to take or to refrain from taking any particular action.  He was named in the litigation because he was one of the state officials involved in the sequence of events which led to the failure of the Judges to receive their FY2004 COLAs.  There is nothing unusual about his inclusion as a party.  Examples of Illinois governors being joined as defendants in cases seeking declaratory and injunctive relief based on alleged violations of state constitutional and legal requirements are commonplace.
Jorgensen, 811 N.E.2d at 652 (emphasis added).
The special prosecutor curiously omitted this passage from his discussion of Jorgensen, even though it appears immediately before the passage that the special prosecutor chose to block quote.  This omission is telling.  After all, the passage shows that a governor would have legislative immunity if someone were seeking to hold him “personally liable for his actions,” id. — as the special prosecutor is attempting to do here.
Clinton is not helpful to the special prosecutor either.  The Supreme Court there said that immunity does not apply to unofficial conduct — but that it would apply to official acts.  As the Court explained, “[t]he principal rationale for affording certain public servants immunity from suits for money damages arising out of their official acts is inapplicable to unofficial conduct.”  Clinton, 520 U.S. at 692-93.  Here, Governor Perry is being held criminally liable for an official act (a veto), not for any unofficial conduct, so he is entitled to immunity.
* * *Allowing Count I to proceed would utterly defeat the purpose of legislative immunity.  Governors “must enjoy the same ability to speak and act in their legislative capacities, without fear of retribution, either criminally or civilly, because of what they say or how they vote.”  Holton, 997 A.2d at 856.  Governors “may be called upon to answer for their legislative conduct to the citizens who elected them, which is what democracy is all about.”  Id.  “[B]ut they may not be compelled to defend their legislative conduct to a prosecutor, to a grand jury or to a court.”  Id.

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.
