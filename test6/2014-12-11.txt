The Australian researcher who says his governments shark policy bites because its based on JawsBy Peter Holley December 10, 2014 Follow @peterjholley
Buh bump buhbump buhbump. (Andrew Brandy Casagrande/Discovery Channel via AP)
The Western Australian government's shark-attack policy is heavily influenced by "Jaws," the classic Hollywood thriller that's terrorized audiences since 1975 — and that's a terrible, terrible thing, according to Christopher Neff.
Neff, a public policy lecturer at the University of Sydney's Department of Government and International Relations, delivers that message in a new paper published in the December issue of the Australian Journal of Political Science.
In the movie, a great white with a taste for human flesh and a desire for revenge slaughters residents of a New England beach town before it's eventually hunted down and killed.
In real life, Neff argues, the government's "imminent threat policy," which was designed to catch and kill sharks in the wake of an attack, "is predicated on Hollywood fiction" — the idea that once a shark has bitten someone, it will strike again and again.
Neff examined shark policies between 2000 and 2014 and found "striking similarities" to the film. He has a name for the influence cinematic fiction plays on real-life policy: The "Jaws" Effect.
"This policy is using myths as the basis for killing sharks that are protected by law and which provides no real beach safety,” Neff said in a statement. "This fiction serves an important political purpose because films allow politicians to rely on familiar narratives following shark bites to blame individual sharks in order to make the events governable and to trump evidence-based science."
The evidence, according to Neff, says that shark bites are rarely fatal and that there is no such thing as a "rogue shark" that hunts humans. Since 1580, Neff said, there have been a reported 2,569 shark-bite incidents off six of the seven continents (some of the statistics are based on oral history), according to the International Shark Attack File.
And yet, Neff argues, attacks are rarely the result of the same shark; public policies designed to "control" sharks near beaches — such as the Western Australian government's $22 million "shark-bite mitigation efforts" — kill protected species and harm conservation efforts, he says.
"In the waters off the U.S. eastern seaboard,"  according to livescience.com , "populations of many species of sharks have dropped by 50 percent and some have fallen by as much as 90 percent."
Neff cites shark biologist John Stevens, who has noted that humans are not normal prey for sharks. If they were, Stevens is quoted as saying, "I can assure you we would be having rather more attacks than we do."
Changes in the public's perception of sharks didn't start with "Jaws," according to George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research in Gainesville.
"Perceptions especially changed during World War II, when a lot of people were put out to sea, and stories of shark attacks after ships or airplanes going down rose," Burgess  told livescience.com . "So there was this stereotype of sharks being man-eaters that had to be looked out for."
But the perception worsened with the release of "Jaws," Burgess added, because the terrifying blockbuster portrayed the animals as having human-like memory that spurred them to target specific victims.
"The movie certainly gave sharks too much of an ability to engage in revenge," he said.
That myth has even been dispelled by the man who wrote "Jaws," according to Neff's paper. In the summer of 2000, three fatal shark attacks occurred in a span of three months, creating a public uproar that supported the notion that the killings were the work of a single shark. Several months later, another swimmer was killed and died from blood loss in front of beach-goers.
With huge amounts of attention given to the incidents in the media, and many witnesses comparing the attacks to scenes from the movie, "Jaws" author Peter Benchley wrote a letter to Australians in the Guardian newspaper .
"While I cannot pretend to comprehend the grief felt by Ken Crew's friends and family, and would not conceive of diminishing the horror of the attack, I plead with the people of Australia – who live with, understand and, in general, respect sharks more than any other nation on earth – to refrain from slaughtering this magnificent ocean predator in the hope of achieving some catharsis, some fleeting satisfaction, from wreaking vengeance on one of nature's most exquisite creations."
"This was not a rogue shark, tantalised by the taste of human flesh and bound now to kill and kill again. Such creatures do not exist, despite what you might have derived from Jaws."
Even so, Neff argues, the myth persists that there are sharks that remain close to swimming areas for extended periods. In September, Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett referred to such "rogue sharks" and said they needed to be caught and removed.
“The message from this research is that politicians do not have a right to their own set of scientific facts about sharks, no matter how popular the movie," Neff says.
He adds: "Unpacking the politics of shark bites, or any public policy issue, involves addressing the way words and images are used to paint a picture for the public and inform policy choices. This research therefore offers broader implications for policy analysis. [It] identifies a worrying style of policymaking where widely known fiction can be used to navigate the attribution of blame and to prescribe policy responses.”

In reform mode  govt tables bill to auction coalblocksBy: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:11 am
Taking a step towards reforming the coal sector, the government Wednesday introduced a bill in Parliament to auction coal blocks to power, steel and cement producing companies, likely from the next month.
Tabling the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Bill 2014, Coal Minister Piyush Goyal told the Lok Sabha that the legislation was necessitated in the wake of the Supreme Court’s September 24 decision to cancel 204 coal blocks. He added that the government moved ahead with the Bill to avert a crisis in electricity generation, save lakhs of workers from being rendered jobless and prevent thousands of crores of bank funds from turning into “stressed assets”.
Introducing the Bill had also become a necessity to replace the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 2014 implemented in October to facilitate auctioning of cancelled coal mines. Passage of the legislation would pave way to bid out 74 ready-to-mine coal blocks.
Goyal refuted the contention of the TMC and Left MPs that the bill sought to de-nationalise coal mines in the country and facilitate total exploitation of the mines and their workers.
As per the Bill, any prior allottee convicted for an offence relating to coal block allocations and sentenced with imprisonment for more than three years, would be barred from participating in the auction. Also, any private company entering a joint venture with a state-run entity would be able to hold a maximum of 26 per cent stake in the firm.
The Bill envisages appointing a ‘nominated authority’ for conducting the auction process and allotment of mines with the assistance of experts, executing the vesting order for transfer and vesting cancelled coal mines. The authority will collect proceeds of the auction and pass them on to the states where the auctioned mines are located. Firms, which have lost their blocks have been allowed by the Supreme Court to bid for the mines by paying an additional levy of Rs 295 per metric tonne of coal extracted from them. Any dispute between the existing allocattees and winning bidders would be settled through a tribunal to be constituted under the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957.
While the blocks to be auctioned would have land free of any encumbrances, the clearances secured by the existing allocattees would also get passed to successful bidders. However, it is yet to be known how the bidders would be facilitated for blocks which either do not have green clearances or have expired ones.

Section 66A of IT Act does not silence anyone:SCWritten by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:09 am
The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it was “sure” that Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, which empowers police to make arrests over social media messages, “does not silence anyone”.
With the provision being challenged over its constitutional validity, a bench of Justices J Chelameswar and S A Bobde observed: “If you (petitioner) don’t know who are you taking to, who all will have access to your messages and who could finally get offended, does it not obligate you to be more careful? Don’t equate right to speak with right to offend. You can always exercise your right to speak, your freedom of speech and expression without offending people. Law does not silence anyone. But it may ask you not to offend anyone by what you speak.”
Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, who represented one of the petitioners in a batch of pleas that have sought get Section 66A declared unconstitutional, replied that this may have a “chilling effect” on one’s right to speech since what is offensive is a matter of subjectivity. He also said that the “vagueness” in defining what was offensive could land a person in jail for three years under Section 66A.
“We agree it is a vexed issue, but we wonder if an injunction to be careful is being treated as an injunction to be silent. It is a law that does not silence anyone and we are sure about that… Sending someone to jail for three years is also a question,” retorted the bench.
It added that the freedom to speak never intended to grant a liberty to speak anything against anyone and that there have been similar laws in other statutes where people were prosecuted for offences without explicit mens rea (intention).
Poovayya had argued that Section 66A entailed imprisonment although there could be no intention by somebody, who sent a message or simply forwarded it, to offend anyone.
At this, the bench asked Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta if the government was sending people to jail without an intention to commit an offence.
Mehta cited several other laws, including those relating to rash driving and putting up obscene posters in a public place, where no explicit “mens rea” was required to attract prosecution.
Mehta also justified that mere sending a contentious message was adequate and that the recipient did not need to even open the mail. He cited malware and viruses as illustration, where the recipient did not require to open his mail but the sender could be booked under Section 66A.
The bench will resume hearing petitions on Thursday.

India eyes oil  defence deals  Russia looks to boosttradeWritten by Shubhajit Roy | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:04 am
The plan to chart out a 10-year vision statement – aimed at giving a fillip to India-Russia ties by bolstering cooperation in defence, nuclear power and hydrocarbons – would be high on the agenda of the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and visiting President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.
As many as 15 to 20 pacts for both the government and the private sectors are expected to be signed during the day-long visit by the Russian leader, who was scheduled to arrive here on Wednesday night. He would leave on Thursday night after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
An oil and gas pipeline from Russia to India – on a route similar to the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanstan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline – would also be on the agenda.
Sources said while Putin would make a push to boost trade relationship between the two nations in the face of western sanctions, Modi would pitch for “Make in India” and try to woo Russian investors.
The two leaders are scheduled to reach Hyderabad House at around 11.30 am for a one-on-one meeting, which will be followed by lunch. Talks will continue after lunch with the delegation members joining in.
With Putin’s visit coming one-and-a-half months ahead of US President Barack Obama’s trip, the Indian side wants Russians to commit potential investments in defence and nuclear power sectors. One of the key elements of the vision statement could be joint development and production of the components for building nuclear power plants, the sources said.
They said specific discussions are likely to take place on various key projects, including the ambitious Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) programme.
Putin and Modi would meet for their first annual summit on Thursday, although it would be their third meeting this year. The annual summit has been taking place since 2000 alternately in Moscow and New Delhi.
Ahead of his visit, Putin had termed ties with India as “privileged strategic partnership”, and said construction of new nuclear plants besides military and technical cooperation was high on the agenda for talks. He said Russia was keen to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India and involve ONGC in oil and gas hunt in the Arctic.
In the nuclear energy sector, Russia might offer to set up 20-24 nuclear energy production units in India against previously agreed 14-16 plants.
Russian Ambassador Alexander Kadakin said the two countries soon would start negotiations for setting up the fifth and the sixth units of the Kudankulam nuclear power complex and might also sign a technical pact for units three and four during the President’s visit.
Both leaders might also discuss improving supply of rough diamonds by Russia to India. Russia is the world’s top producer of rough diamonds and India is one of its largest importers. The two leaders would also inaugurate the World Diamond Conference here on Thursday.

Cabinet gives nod to amend LokpalActBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:03 am
The Union Cabinet on Wednesday gave approval to amend the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 (1 of 2014) and the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946) to address some “crucial deficiencies” in both the legislations.
The Cabinet has also cleared the introduction of a Bill during the winter session of Parliament on the lines of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas amendment Bill.
The main amendment relates to the composition of the Selection Committee for choosing the chairperson and members of Lokpal. The amendment will provide that “when there is no Leader of Opposition in the House of the People, recognised as such, the expression Leader of Opposition shall include the leader of the largest party in Opposition in the Lok Sabha”. The other amendment is related to qualification for the director of prosecution in the CBI and his/her functional independence. “The proposed amendments will also address other deficiencies in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013,” the government said in a release.
The government further said that the amendments seek to synchronise the provisions of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act with the existing regulating laws, rules and regulations in respect of declaration of assets and liabilities by various categories of public servants.
Other decisions
* Nod to create five posts of Additional Solicitors General, one each for the High Courts of Punjab & Haryana, Patna, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Karnataka and its Circuit Benches at Hubli-Dharwad and Gulbarga.
* Clearance for transfer of land for the implementation of Metro Rail projects. The proposal is to restrict central ministries/ departments/ PSUs from asking for land in exchange for land required for Metro projects.

Dow sheds 250 after oil finds 5-year lowNASDAQ

"Oil continues to be the concern. Depending on who you talk to and in what time frame on which day of the week, oil may be a leading indicator, so there may be something behind the decline other than we have a lot of oil," said Paul Nolte, senior vice president, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management.
"I don't know that for sure. I do know, historically at least, energy stocks have tended to lead the market, and that lead time is anything from three months to a year, and we're now six months into oil underperforming the overall market, so we may be in for some rough sledding," he added.
Energy companies led by Oneok , Chesapeake Energy and Denbury Resources were the session's worst performers among the S&P 500.
"From a valuation perspective, at least based on what we see from earnings estimates for oil companies, they are very inexpensive. But the market has never stopped at fair value, so it's like trying to catch a falling knife," said Nolte.
"You've got an energy-related sell off again today leaking into financials; the thought process there is if in fact this continues to get weak you might have some financial crisis in high-debt, frack-related loans out there; this is very levered industry," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.

Wells Fargo Allegedly Pushed Dangerous Loans On MinoritiesWells Fargo Deliberately Pushed Dangerous Loans On Blacks, Hispanics: Lawsuit

Wells Fargo has been accused of targeting minorities with predatory high-cost home loans that pushed them into default and foreclosure.
Cook County, Illinois, which is home to the city of Chicago, filed a lawsuit in federal court on Friday against the nation’s largest mortgage lender. The suit alleges that Wells Fargo contributed to the housing crisis, which the county claims has cost it millions of dollars in lost property tax and the cost of having to deal with abandoned buildings, among other issues. The lawsuit says damages could exceed $300 million.
Wells Fargo deliberately issued home loans with high interest rates and inflated or improper fees to black and Hispanic borrowers, many of whom would not have qualified for a traditional loan, the suit alleges. The lawsuit also charges that the bank did so even when it was clear the borrowers wouldn’t be able to keep up with the costly payment plans.
Such practices are known as “equity stripping,” the suit says, because they “stripped and continue to strip borrower home equity.” As a result, the chances that minority borrowers would fall behind on payments or be forced to submit to foreclosures were increased, it said.
Between 2000 and August 2014, Wells Fargo allegedly made about 55,000 loans to minority homeowners in Cook County that are suspected of being predatory and discriminatory, according to a statement released by Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez.
Wells Fargo vehemently denies the allegations, calling them “baseless.” “It’s disappointing they chose to pursue a lawsuit against Wells Fargo rather than collaborate together to help borrowers and home owners in the County,” company spokesman Tom Goyda told HuffPost in a prepared statement.
“Wells Fargo’s team members live and work in the Chicago area and we stand behind our record as a fair and responsible lender,” Goyda said, adding that the company has an $8.2 million down payment assistance grant program that “helped create 547 new homeowners” in Cook County over the past two years.
“We will vigorously defend ourselves and continue to focus on helping customers succeed financially and expanding homeownership in Illinois and across the United States,” he added.
The suit alleges that Wells Fargo violated the Fair Housing Act, a federal law that prohibits race-based discrimination by mortgage lenders.
Cook County has walked this path before: Preckwinkle and Alvarez filed very similar suits earlier this year against HSBC and Bank Of America. Bank Of America spokesman Richard Simon said there “is no basis” for the claims the lawsuit makes. HSBC did not return a request for comment to HuffPost.
In the past, cities including Baltimore and Miami have also sued Wells Fargo and other banks on allegations of discriminatory home lending practices. A lawsuit brought by Baltimore against Wells Fargo charging that the bank steered minority homeowners into costly loan agreements and also charged minorities higher interest rates and fees than white borrowers with the same credit scores was ultimately settled in 2012 for $175 million .
More recently, though, a judge dismissed a suit from the city of Miami against the bank, saying there was no standing to sue under the Fair Housing Act and that the suit had been brought too late, according to Bloomberg News.

Korean Air CEO s daughter resigns in row over nutsNissan Motor announces pre-bookings of Datsun GO+ in India
The daughter of Korean Air’s CEO resigned today after being widely criticised for having the chief purser kicked off a plane because of the way she had been served some nuts.
Cho Hyun-Ah, a top executive in Korean Air’s in-flight service, forced the New York-Seoul flight to return to its gate last Friday to remove the most senior member of the crew, causing the plane to be delayed.
Her behaviour attracted heavy criticism in South Korea, where she was accused of being petty and arrogant, and even prompted a state probe over a possible breach of aviation safety laws.
“I feel so sorry for our customers and South Koreans for causing such trouble… and seek forgiveness from the people who might have been hurt by me,” Cho, 40, said in a statement released by Korean Air.
“I will resign from all my posts at Korean Air to take responsibility for the incident,” she was quoted as saying.
Korean Air CEO Cho Yang-Ho immediately accepted her resignation, according to the statement.
Korean Air’s spokesman told AFP that Cho would retain the title of vice president even though she no longer had any official role in the company, adding it was not clear whether she would hold any responsibilities in the future.
The Seoul flight had just left its gate at New York’s JFK airport on Friday when the incident occurred.
Cho, sitting in first class, took exception to the arrival of some macadamia nuts she had not asked for, and to the fact that they were served in a packet rather than a bowl.
She summoned the chief purser who, according to an earlier Korean Air statement, replied with “lies and excuses” when challenged over his crew’s knowledge of in-flight service procedures.
Cho then decided the chief purser was “incapable” and the plane returned to the gate where he disembarked, causing an 11-minute delay in arrival.
Korean Air — South Korea’s flag carrier — earlier apologised for causing “inconvenience” for passengers but defended Cho’s action as a “reasonable” move to improve in-flight service.
It also argued that the final decision to deplane the employee was taken by the captain.
Transport Minister Suh Seoung-Hwan said earlier Tuesday the incident was being investigated and any regulatory breach would be “handled sternly”.
The media backlash against Cho has been extensive.
“This ugly behaviour by the Korean Air boss’s daughter puts the entire nation to shame,” Seoul’s top business daily, the Maeil Business Newspaper, said in an editorial.
“This is a global embarrassment for South Korea… Korean Air should punish Cho, and she should apologise to the public for disregarding passengers’ safety,” it said.

Banning Drones Won t Solve the Problemreddit
The Federal Aviation Administration recently released a report detailing more than 190 safety incidents involving drones and commercial aircraft. In response, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has vowed to push legislation that would crack down on the commercial use of drones, also called Unmanned Aircraft Systems ( UAS ). India's Directorate General for Civil Aviation has already banned all use of drones in the country -- even for civilian purposes.
There are valid concerns that the proliferation of drones will endanger commercial flights and cause serious accidents. The U.S. military is rightfully worried that drones will be weaponized as killing machines and become autonomous flying IEDs (improvised explosive devices) that target a specific individual by means of facial recognition.
Banning commercial drone use will not solve these problems; it will just give us a false sense of comfort and kick the can further down the road.
About two years ago, I wrote a Washington Post column in which I argued that we need to prepare ourselves for the " drone age ." It isn't just the United States that is developing drone capabilities; governments and DIYers all over the world are doing the same, particularly the Chinese. This isn't all bad; there are many good uses for drone technologies.
To start with, there isn't yet a clear consensus on what a drone is. Is it something that flies and is remote controlled? If that is the case, should the FAA also ban remote-controlled airplanes and helicopters that hobbyists have flown happily and relatively safely for many years? The drone encounter that Senator Feinstein cited in a Senate Commerce Committee hearing as a reason to regulate commercial drone flights was reportedly just a pink toy helicopter.
Then there is the practicability of enforcement. If the government should institute restrictions and penalties, who will enforce them? Will the police buy high-performance drones to shoot down illicit drones? Can we scramble the Air Force to blow a flock of $300 quadcopters out of the sky? Should we equip legions of young children with air rifles? Proposing laws without realistic hope of enforcement does nothing to solve the problems at hand.
Let's first acknowledge that drones will be common in our skies and that they will play an integral role in our economy and society. We know that drones are saving money and improving safety on many types of remote inspection such as that of distant pipelines and tall broadcast towers. Documentary filmmakers use drones to get aerial shots that are not affordable with a regular plane or helicopter. As well, start-ups like Matternet are pioneering the use of drones to deliver critical medical supplies to remote parts of the developing world. Drones could be used as long-haul cargo-delivery vehicles, allowing for more efficient point-to-point delivery of goods and materials. Then of course, companies such as Google and Amazon are developing drone delivery services that provide within-the-hour delivery of ordered goods--without putting any more traffic onto the streets or carbon into the skies.
So if we don't ban the drones, what can we do to prepare for them and weave their capabilities into a broader picture of economic development?
First, there needs to be a core technology framework for collision avoidance. This is no small problem. Even the best computer-vision algorithms struggle to navigate complex cityscapes. The vehicles in NASA's DARPA challenge weighed thousands of pounds and carried serious computational and sensor firepower. Yet they could barely navigate barren wastelands without flipping themselves over or running into a wall. So how will a drone the size of a shoebox carry enough intelligence to avoid hitting a building, a person, a car, a power line or, worst case, a commercial aircraft? It's a wonderful engineering challenge and worth the focus of some of our best minds.
Assuming we have collision-avoidance systems in place, how can we build a system of distributed air-traffic control for drones? It would obviously need to be computer-driven and automatic, and to include safety measures and emergency kill switches or other mechanisms to bring down a drone that is malfunctioning or poses a danger. We would need to plan for specific air corridors in city areas that are dedicated to drones and confine the drones to those places. Again, this is a huge engineering challenge, but not one that is insurmountable.
We also need to build private and commercial air-defense systems, just as the military is developing, to shield our schools, homes, and businesses from drone surveillance or attack. I wonder whether force fields such as we saw on Star Trek may become a practical reality.
Beyond the technical issues, we need to debate what is socially acceptable and to create legal frameworks. Should the cameras of delivery drones be recording and saving all video footage as they enter into the airspace of a customer's home? For that matter, should drones be allowed to fly over private property at all -- or should they be limited to public roads between droneports? Should we have the right to shoot down unauthorized drones on our property? If the Second Amendment grants the right of gun ownership to individuals for self-defense, then does it allow them to fly their own defensive drones?
These are issues we need to tackle -- and soon. The drones are coming, whether we are ready or not.

Racial disparities in social and economic outcomes exist in all parts of the United States. Black Americans make about 62 cents for every dollar earned by white Americans. Black Americans are also twice as likely to be unemployed and considerably more likely to live in poverty.
In some places, these disparities are even more pronounced. In many of the worst states for black Americans, there are opportunities to get a good job, earn good pay, and buy a home in a good community. However, these opportunities are not uniformly accessible across racial lines. Based on an examination of a number of socio-economic measures, 24/7 Wall St. identified the worst states for black Americans.
Click here to see the worst states for black Americans
According to Dr. Valerie Wilson, Program Director on Race and Ethnicity in the Economy at the Economic Policy Institute, “You’re never going to find a state or city where the outcome for blacks are better than for whites.” For centuries, there have been stark differences in the conditions and opportunities black Americans have faced.
The Civil Rights Movement led to hopes that racial inequality would soon end. The movement led to a series of reforms, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and other legislation, known as the “Great Society.” Over the following 50 years, however, further advances have been modest at best.
According to Dedrick Asante-Muhammad, Senior Director of the Economic Department at the NAACP Financial Freedom Center, “It’s one thing to end segregation, but it’s another thing to talk about billions of dollars of investment.” When the United States invested in a middle class in the 1940s and 1950s, it was in a white middle class, explained Asante-Muhammad. However, the country was “never willing to do that same type of investment to create a middle class that would be inclusive of African Americans.”
The effects of this unwillingness to invest in the black community are clear in the racial economic outcome gaps. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for example, the national jobless rate for November was 5.8% nationwide. Among white Americans, the figure was 4.9%. Among black Americans it was 11.1%.
Segregation also creates different communities with different social services. The quality of schools, property values, the quality of services available, and the quality of food are all “legacies of racially segregated neighborhoods in this country,” said Wilson. Six of the worst states were home to nearly half of the 30 most segregated U.S. cities, according to a University of Michigan Institute for Social Research study on racial segregation in large metropolitan areas.
Few factors do more to improve people’s livelihoods than access to good jobs. High employment rates contribute to higher incomes, better health insurance coverage, as well as lower poverty rates. In eight of the worst states for black Americans, the difference between black unemployment rates and that of the whole workforce was higher than the national difference. Black Americans in these states also tended to have higher poverty rates, lower incomes, and lower educational attainment rates than both their white peers and black residents in other states.

Delhi rape case: Uber ceases operations in the capitalRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
In the eye of a storm over a rape case, global cab-booking firm Uber today finally ceased its operations in the national capital complying with a government ban imposed on it three days back.
The move by the US-based firm came even as the Delhi Government and Traffic Police engaged in a blame game with both putting the onus on each other to enforce the ban.
Though Delhi Government had imposed a ban on Uber on Monday with immediate effect, the app-based taxi booking company continued with its services till late last evening, claiming that it had not received any communication about the action.
Police said Delhi Government’s order banning the cab company in the city was hand delivered to its officials last evening after they claimed that the order was yet to reach them.
The Delhi government on Monday had announced banning Uber and other app-based taxi services with immediate effect after the rape of a 27-year-old woman executive allegedly by a cabbie contracted by the US-based Uber.
Delhi Police has already filed an FIR against Uber charging it with cheating its customers and defying government orders.
A number of Uber Executives including its Asia-Pacific head Eric Alexander have been questioned in the last two days. Alexander, who is based in Hong Kong, was called by Delhi Police to join investigations and he did so yesterday.
Delhi Government’s Transport department said it does not have adequate resources to enforce the ban while Traffic Police maintained that those who announced the move must execute it.
“We have asked the Delhi Traffic police to immediately implement the ban on web-based cab services, including Uber, in the national capital,” a Transport Department official told PTI when asked how Uber was operating three days after it was banned.

Whatever happened to Ikea monkeyBy Miles Klee, The Daily Dot December 10, 2014
(The Daily Dot/Story Book Primate Farm Sanctuary)
On Dec. 9, 2012, the Web was forever changed by a tweet and an Instagram photo. Both depicted Darwin, a young Japanese snow macaque that had been spotted in the parking lot of an IKEA store in the Toronto area. He was wearing a diaper and a faux-shearling coat.
Social media came to a virtual standstill as people speculated on the origins of the well-dressed #IkeaMonkey, who deservedly became an instant meme on an otherwise uneventful Sunday.
(Daily Dot via Twitter)
(Daily Dot via KnowYourMeme)
Animal control arrived to contain the confused primate, kicking off a long custody battle that didn’t make nearly as many headlines as the curious incident itself — but should have. Real estate lawyer Yasmin Nakhuda, Darwin’s original owner, went to court with her husband several times to sue (and make tearful pleas) for his return. There were just two problems: It’s actually illegal to own a pet monkey in Toronto, and Nakhuda had signed a surrender form.
#IkeaMonkey is a Rhesus Macaque Monkey Approx. 7 months old. In good health; stressed. Jacket is wool and said to be his favourite.

— Tom Podolec CTV News (@TomPodolec) December 9, 2012
Following his adventure in interior decorating, Darwin was taken to Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary in Sunderland, Ontario, a couple hours north of Toronto, where he has lived happily ever since.
“Darwin had been imprinted by humans, which rarely bodes well for a monkey,” his keepers wrote on their Web site. “He was very insecure upon arrival, and needed to be the centre of everyone’s attention.”
These days, however, he’s a cheeky and well-adjusted fellow, communicating with fellow macaques Julien and Lexy, and grooming Sweet Pea, an olive baboon. He loves his Curious George doll and snacking on cherries.
But money woes seem to follow the famous monkey. Early this year, Nakhuda was slapped with the legal bill for Story Book’s defense against the doomed lawsuits: $83,077 all told, though the lawyer had been working pro bono. Now Story Book is in trouble as well: “Due to a change in our human family situation, the sanctuary needs to relocate by spring of 2015,” they explained in a new crowdfunding call for C$490,000 ($426,773 U.S.) that prominently features Darwin’s likeness and story. With that sum, he and 21 other monkeys can be rehoused in a facility that’s already home to 20 primates, including potential social matches.
Bronwyn Page, who took one of the iconic #IkeaMonkey photos and became a meme in her own right thanks to a local news chyron, told the Daily Dot in an e-mail that her involvement in the story has also had a lasting impact. “Yeah, I have been recognized on the street and subway a couple times,” she said. “The fact that I saw the monkey still comes up all the time.”
(Daily Dot/via Buzzfeed)
Page continued:
A friend of mine dressed like the meme of me with the “Saw the monkey” news caption for Halloween just this year. I’ve been offered jobs because of it. This week I’ve been asked to tell my story at a storytelling event (just a coincidence that it’s also the anniversary this week). My involvement in the actual incident lasted only about one minute, which is why it’s so crazy that I’ve gotten so much attention for it. I just snapped a couple photos and went on my way. One thing, though, that people might not realize is that it all happened in the parking lot of IKEA. The monkey never went inside IKEA.
So Darwin was never actually in the market for a couch or Swedish meatballs — but we wanted to know what Page bought, and whether it stood the test of time. “I actually went there to buy a $20 Xmas tree,” she told the Daily Dot, “so no, it’s not still functioning!”
We contacted Story Book with hopes of learning more about Darwin’s life outside the limelight. “He has grown into quite the handsome guy, almost three times bigger than he was since he was first found in the IKEA parking lot, and he is now a healthy, happy youth, full of energy!” wrote volunteer Kim Meehan to the Daily Dot in an e-mail. Staff have invited media to a behind-the-scenes tour of the sanctuary on Dec. 12, a day on which they’ll also mark “the second anniversary of Darwin’s arrival and rescue from the exotic pet trade, a largely unregulated trade in Canada which is the cause of much cruelty and abuse towards animals.”
(The Daily Dot/Story Book Primate Farm Sanctuary)
As for the planned move: “A perfect property has appeared on the market and now is the time for Darwin and friends to relocate. The property for sale has ample indoor and outdoor space on 50 acres of forested land,” though it “may not remain on sale much longer.”
With some Google Maps sleuthing, we deduced (and Page and Story Book confirmed) that Darwin’s IKEA is in North York, Ontario, just off the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway. After navigating the company’s automated phone system, a friendly operator named Nancy was able to connect us with the store’s public relations department, where no employee was available to share their reminiscence of that magical day two years ago. But who could possibly forget … ?

Cabinet approves Insurance Bill; Rajya Sabha may take up next weekNissan Motor announces pre-bookings of Datsun GO+ in India
The Cabinet tonight approved the Insurance Amendment Bill with a composite foreign investment cap of 49 per cent for presenting it in Parliament, incorporating the changes suggested by a House panel.
The Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved incorporation of amendments suggested by a Parliamentary select panel in the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008, sources said.
The Rajya Sabha is likely to take up the Bill for consideration and passage next week.
Earlier today, the Select Committee in its report to the Rajya Sabha had suggested hike in composite foreign investment limit in insurance sector to 49 per cent which would include Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as well as portfolio investment.
At present only 26 per cent FDI is allowed in private sector insurance companies. The hike in foreign investment limit is estimated to attract about Rs 25,000 crore of overseas funds in the sector.
“The Committee recommends that the composite cap of 49 per cent should be inclusive of all forms of foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investments,” the report said.
The Congress support for the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008, is crucial as the ruling NDA does not have majority in the Upper House.
The bill, which has been pending since 2008, may not have a smooth ride in the Rajya Sabha with certain political parties opposing further opening of the insurance sector to foreign investment.

Elite law students demand postponed exams after Mike Brown  Eric Garner cases. Not everyone is sympathetic.By Abby Phillip December 10, 2014 Follow @abbydphillip
The Columbia University campus in New York. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)
Students at some elite law schools are demanding action: They want their final exams postponed because of the grand jury decisions related to the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.
If your reaction was “huh?”  welcome to the club: Some critics think the demands seem a little too convenient, especially coming from people who should be clamoring to take their place in the legal system, if only to help fix whatever problems they perceive.
“We have been traumatized over and again by the devaluation of Black and Brown lives,” wrote members of the Columbia Law School Coalition of Concerned Students of Color in a Dec. 6 letter to the school administration . “We are falling apart.”
The students asked that the university “recognize” their trauma as legitimate and schedule an “emergency event” to address the two cases.
Similar letters have subsequently been penned by a broad coalition of student groups at Harvard University Law School  and a coalition of black students at  the Georgetown University Law Center .
The requests might have gone largely unnoticed had the Columbia coalition not received this response from the university administration Saturday:
The grand juries’ determinations to return non-indictments in the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases have shaken the faith of some in the integrity of the grand jury system and in the law more generally. For some law students, particularly, though not only, students of color, this chain of events is all the more profound as it threatens to undermine a sense that the law is a fundamental pillar of society designed to protect fairness, due process and equality.
Robert Scott, the law school’s interim dean, also noted that students who feel they have experienced “trauma” as a result of the events could petition, through a pre-existing policy, to postpone their exams.
That letter, which was first posted online by the Powerline blog, was met with scorn by conservatives  — and what can only be interpreted as a deep, heaving sigh of resignation from legal experts.
“Despite the genuine trauma that law students may honestly feel about the Ferguson and Garner decisions, as lawyers, they are going to be dealing with tragedies many times worse,” defense lawyer Benjamin Brafman told  the New York Times . “If law students cannot function with difficult issues like these, maybe they should not try and become lawyers.”
Brafman called the students’ demand “absurd.”
So far, the Times reported, several students have postponed their exams.
Harvard, Yale and Georgetown have reiterated pre-existing policies that allow students to postpone exams due to traumatic events.
Responding to the furor bubbling up in their student bodies  and overflowing across the country, Harvard Law School Dean Martha Minow and Yale Law School Dean Robert Post acknowledged in a joint Boston Globe editorial that trust in the American legal system needs to be restored.
“As deans of law schools devoted to the rule of law, we work continuously to instill a commitment to the legal system,” they wrote. “We regard the rule of law as a precious and fragile resource. But the rule of law requires the legal system to respect procedures necessary to expose and correct its own mistakes.
“A failing legal system puts us all in a chokehold.”
What both deans failed to address is the role that their graduates — who are presumptively some of the best, brightest and most well positioned young legal minds in the country — play in affecting how that legal system operates.
It is no secret that graduates of elite law schools, including Columbia, Harvard, Yale and Georgetown, often end up at large corporate law firms rather than working as prosecutors or public defenders.
A quick look at the employment statistics for 2013 Harvard, Yale and Columbia make this discrepancy pretty clear:
You can find full employment statistics for each of the schools here , here , here  and here . (Not included in this chart are the students who graduate and then clerk for judges, which many would justifiably consider public service as well.)
The trend is apparent, though to a lesser degree, at Georgetown.
But despite the national conversation about justice, there has been virtually no mention in the student letters to law school administrators of the need to increase the number of elite graduates working both as prosecutors and as legal-aid providers for people who in their interactions with law enforcement might be victims of excessive force.
The students have noted that they have protested in the streets, written op-eds , and stood in solidarity with others demonstrating the deaths of Garner and Brown and the subsequent grand jury decisions. But they haven’t addressed what they will do about the problem when — and perhaps, if — they graduate and enter the very legal system they are now critiquing.
On Wednesday, the Harvard Law students acknowledged the criticism of their demands and thanked the university for responding. And perhaps recognizing that the focus on postponing exams has detracted from other legitimate concerns, they acknowledged “missteps.”
“We did not get everything we asked for,” they wrote. “We may have made some missteps along the way.”

Rosetta data casts doubt on the origins of Earths waterBy Rachel Feltman December 10, 2014 Follow @rachelfeltman
Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has some heavy water. (ESA/Rosetta/NAVCAM)
The water molecules being released by comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko aren't a perfect match for the ones on Earth, according to new data published Wednesday in the journal Science .
Scientists are always trying to figure out where the water on Earth came from . After all, water seems to be a key ingredient in life as we know it. And when Earth was first formed, it was probably too hot for any liquid water to survive -- so how did we get the water we have today? Several leading theories hold that comets brought water molecules to our planet when they collided with an ancient Earth, but the Rosetta orbiter's readings seem to contradict that .
After using Rosetta's ROSINA instrument to sniff out the molecular composition of the comet's vapor emissions, mission scientist Kathrin Altwegg and her team compared the alien water to what we might find on Earth.
Scientists at Germany's Aerospace Center said the comet lander Philae “sniffed” organic molecules containing carbon, an element that is the basis of life on Earth. (Reuters)
Analysis of other comets has been mixed: Some seem to have water identical to our own, and others don't. But comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's water has a much higher ratio of deuterium -- a heavier version of hydrogen -- than Earth water. The researchers have determined that a comet like this one definitely couldn't have seeded Earth with the water it has now.
But this isn't the end of the story, New Scientist reports :
The data collected so far may not be the last word on 67P's water. It is possible that there are pockets of water with a different deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio that could be released as the comet nears the sun and heats up. The two halves of the duck-shaped 67P might even have different hydrogen signatures, which would suggest they were once distinct bodies that formed in different parts of the solar system before colliding. "That would be a very interesting result," says Altwegg.
It's more likely, however, that asteroids were the water bearers. The only comets found to have Earth-like water have been very far away, and research suggests that nearby asteroids fit the bill.

Cong  Left want select panel view on repealing obsoletelawsBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:13 am
On a day the select committee on the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill tabled its report in Rajya Sabha, the Congress and the Left on Wednesday got together to demand that another Bill — Repealing and Amending Bill, 2014 — be sent to a select committee.
The Bill, aimed at repealing certain enactments that have become redundant and amending certain others was listed for consideration but could not be taken up due to paucity of time. When Deputy Chairman P J Kurien announced that the Bill would be taken for debate Thursday, Congress and Left members said they want it to be referred to a select committee.
“We have objections to the way the Bill was listed… We are going to give a notice to refer it to a committee,” Anand Sharma, deputy leader of Congress in the House, said. He added: “Since it has not been referred to the Standing Committee and passed in Lok Sabha without it, it must go to a Select Committee.” Sharma was backed by Left MPs who said they will issue a notice Thursday.

Sonia calls Modi  BJP habitual liars who dont keeppromisesWritten by Arun Sharma , Mir Ehsan | Jammu/srinagar |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:38 am
Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday accused Narendra Modi and the BJP of being habitual liars who make promises and don’t fulfil them. The Congress president addressed a rally each in Shangus and in Anantnag.
“They (BJP and Modi) can go to any extent for the sake of power,” she said in her 12-minute address in Anantnag.
“They have no concern for democracy; the welfare of the people is of no value to them. Their policy is only to use people for dividing society.”
She referred to various promises that are being made by BJP leaders during the current polls, and said they don’t intend to fulfil any of them. “What promise had they not made to the people during Lok Sabha elections, making them believe they will turn this earth into a heaven,” she said.
“Achche din are nowhere in sight even six months after their having assumed power. They promised to bring back black money stashed in foreign banks within 100 days and, after that, to break it into shares and deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen. Now, they refuse even to disclose the names of those whose black money is stashed abroad,” she said.
In Shangus, a constituency in south Kashmir, she blamed the NDA-ruled Centre for neglecting Kashmir during the floods and compared that with the way the Congress government had helped people of the valley after the 2005 earthquake.
“This is the time to address your miseries. This is the time to provide you shelter, food and take care of your daily needs. But the Modi-led central government is paying you no attention. Why are relief efforts moving slowly?”Sonia said. “In times of need, the Congress has always helped people of Kashmir. In 2005, when an earthquake hit the valley, the response from the Centre was fast.”
In Anantnag, she accused the NDA of undoing the UPA’s good work.  She said the UPA government had provided for the supply of lifesaving drugs for TB, cancer and heart ailments on subsidy to the poor, and alleged the Modi government has changed this provision and increased the prices of these lifesaving drugs to benefit a few private concerns. “It appears that they have no concern for the poor,” she said.
“They now intend to even weaken the RTI Act, a powerful tool that the Congress gave the people to fight corruption. The BJP, which had been projecting itself as a crusader against corruption, now wants to weaken it,” she said.

Strongmen of Jharkhand coal  fighting polls and a familyfeudWritten by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Dhanbad |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:31 am
When Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought together his candidates for a final wave at the audience at the conclusion of his speech in Dhanbad on Tuesday, it would have left many BJP leaders uncomfortable.
For, on the PM’s right was Dhullu Mahato and some distance to his left was Sanjeev Singh. Taken together, “they represent the real muscle behind the coal business in the state”, in the words of a government official who served in Jharkhand.
Dhullu Mahato, 39, had to attach two pages to his affidavit to include the details of the seven criminal cases against him, mostly relating to assault and obstructing government officials, and including one offence under the Arms Act.
The Baghmara legislator of Babulal Marandi’s JVM(P) defected to the BJP ahead of the elections. “Dhullu controls a bike-borne group of 500-odd youngsters, called the Tiger Force,” said the government official.
Sanjeev Singh, 28, represents the young face of a family which, in turn, has come to be identified with the coal business in Jharia. And the family is now in a political feud.
Sanjeev’s father, the late Suryadeo Singh, the Janata Party MLA of Jharia during 1977-91, founded the Janata Mazdoor Sangh of coal workers. Sanjeev’s mother Kunti Devi has been the BJP MLA of Jharia for 10 years.
The family, whose house in Dhanbad is called Singh Mansion, derives its political power from the Janata Mazdoor Sangh. Musclemen of the JMS have been frequently accused of charging a fee for coal bought at auctions in Jharia, and the Tiger Force of controlling auctions in Baghmara.
Sanjeev, whose affidavit says he passed high school, is up against engineering graduate Niraj Singh, 35, of the Congress who is also his father’s late younger brother’s son. Niraj is the deputy mayor of Dhanbad. He has branched out into real estate and now controls a faction of the JMS. Niraj is widely regarded as fighting Kunti Singh and P N Singh on behalf of Bachha Singh, a former JD(U) minister of Jharkhand and another brother of Suryadeo Singh. In a sign of how fractured Singh Mansion has become, Niraj does not see eye-to-eye with his mayor Indu Singh, who is his father’s brother Ramadhir Singh’s wife. Ramadhir controls the JMS faction said to back Singh Mansion.
Niraj says of Sanjeev, “They have only two poll issues: Modi-Modi-Modi and ‘I am the son of Suryadeo Singh’.”
The family feud has had Jharia on edge, with minor clashes frequent between supporters  — there was one before PM Modi’s rally, too. While talking to this newspaper, each candidate blamed the other for instigating violence, but neither promised to end it. “You tell me, who starts violence? Those who fear losing, those fighting for survival. This will be an easy win for me: Jharia knows my family since 1977; there is a Modi wave across the country,” said Sanjeev.
The other candidate with muscle power, continued…

Protected Indias interests by fixing Bali agreement:CentreBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:15 am
Days after getting its demand on food security accommodated by World Trade Organization, the government Wednesday said it protected India’s interests by seeking a course correction in the Bali agreement. It said the government has succeeded in removing the “ambiguity” over the permanency of the peace clause on public stock holding for food security purposes.
Replying to clarifications sought by members in Rajya Sabha, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rejected opposition’s claim’s that the Centre’s position had resulted in New Delhi “losing its friends”. “We had gone in as Abhimanyu, but came out successfully with 160 friends, building on our predecessor, who had 93 friends,” she said.
Earlier, Congress leader Anand Sharma said the government was trying to project that a new breakthrough in WTO has been achieved and that the Geneva agreement was the outcome of efforts made only by the new government and the PM, which, he argued, was not the case.

Police suspect guard role injailbreakWritten by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Chaibasa |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:15 am
The Jharkhand Police now suspect involvement of a guard in the Chaibasa jailbreak by the Maoists after it was found that CCTV cameras, mobile jammers and sirens at the prison were not working when the incident took place.
Senior officers are not convinced with the version of jail guards that the prisoners threw chilli powder on them Tuesday evening while trying to escape from the prison. Two senior CPI(Maoist) members were killed and three injured during the incident. None of the 15 inmates who escaped have been caught, with police officials apprehending that they might not be arrested again.
Sentries deployed on the rooftop of the district jail had opened fire when 20 prisoners attempted to flee at around 4.15 pm. They were part of a group of 55 inmates who had just returned from the district court after hearings.
West Singhbhum SP Narendra Kumar Singh said Mochirai Munda, an ex-serviceman employed as jail guard on a contractual basis, has been named in the FIR. “He has been named along with those who escaped as he was responsible for opening both the gates. He should have closed the main gate before opening the second. We will interrogate him to find out if it was intentional,” said the official. A magisterial probe into the incident has also been announced.
The jail van, with 55 undertrials inside, reversed into the premises through the main gate. Munda, who held the keys to the main as well as a smaller entrance through which prisoners had to go on foot, left the main gate wide-open.
Thirty five prisoners had passed through the second gate when Ramvilas Tanti and Tipa Das, both platoon commanders and the seniormost among the rest 20, tried to snatch weapons from the guards.

"I don't know that for sure. I do know, historically at least, energy stocks have tended to lead the market, and that lead time is anything from three months to a year, and we're now six months into oil underperforming the overall market, so we may be in for some rough sledding," he added.
Energy companies led by Oneok , Chesapeake Energy and Denbury Resources were the session's worst performers among the S&P 500.
"From a valuation perspective, at least based on what we see from earnings estimates for oil companies, they are very inexpensive. But the market has never stopped at fair value, so it's like trying to catch a falling knife," said Nolte.
"You've got an energy-related sell off again today leaking into financials; the thought process there is if in fact this continues to get weak you might have some financial crisis in high-debt, frack-related loans out there; this is very levered industry," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.

Uber s Value Just Doubled To $40 Billion In 6 Months (Sorry  Haters)Email
Comment
While many of us have spent the past six months getting mad at Uber, Uber has spent the past six months making $22 billion magically appear.
The ride-sharing app maker, a lightning rod for controversy, announced on Thursday that it has raised $1.2 billion in new funding, bringing the company's value to roughly $40 billion. That's up from a paltry $18 billion six months ago.
Uber's investors are apparently unfazed by bad press. In recent months, the company has had to apologize for a top executive threatening to smear journalists critical of the business. It's also been rated F by the Better Business Bureau, protested by its own drivers, kicked out of Las Vegas and accused of dirty practices aimed at undercutting its rivals.
But Uber is willing to acknowledge it has issues.
"The events of the recent weeks have shown us that we also need to invest in internal growth and change," CEO Travis Kalanick said in the blog post announcing the new funding. He promised Uber would make changes to become "a smarter and more humble company."
One possible teensy consolation for Uber is this factoid suggested by Wall Street Journal editor Dennis Berman: Roughly four years ago, the company was worth $60 million. Today it's worth $40 billion. At this rate of growth, it is appreciating by $19,839 per minute, according to Berman's math.
If you had invested $10,000 in the company when it started, that $10,000 would be worth about $80 million now, estimates tech investor Semil Shah -- though the effects of the company repeatedly issuing new stock would have cut that gain down significantly by making stock worth less. Maybe your $10,000 share would only be worth $20 million today. Still, $20 million > $10,000, according to my math.
At the moment, Uber is worth more than most members of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. It is worth more than Delta Air Lines and the railroad company CSX. It's also worth more than all the personal real estate in Anaheim, California .
Whether the company is actually worth all that money, or whether it's just the poster child for a growing startup bubble, is a different question altogether. Uber is making a lot of money, though the exact amount won't be entirely clear until the company goes public -- at which point maybe you can help boost Uber's valuation, too.
An Uber spokeswoman declined to provide further comment.

Target Worker s Speech Is Maybe The Best Thing That s Happened On A Black FridayEmail
Comment
What do a horde of Spartan warriors on the verge of battle and a store full of Target employees on Black Friday have in common?
A dude who can give a kick-ass motivational speech, that's what.
Meet Scott Simms, an employee at a Target store in Westminster, Md., who hammered home a triumphant rallying cry to his co-workers before Black Friday shoppers descended on his store last week. We might never have known about the speech, or its echoes of the 2006 action movie "300," if not for a former co-worker who posted this video to Reddit:
"I prepared it in my head a little bit during the day," Simms told Carroll County Times , adding that he plans on giving a similar speech next year on Black Friday. "I kind of wanted to do it because every year there's that calm before the storm and it kind of reminded me of '300' or 'Braveheart.'"
Target confirmed to The Huffington Post that the video is authentic.
"We have long said that Thanksgiving weekend is to retail what a championship game is to sports," a Target spokeswoman wrote in an email. "Scott is clearly quite a coach."
The speech fits with Simms' general attitude toward work, the former coworker, Vincent Scellini, told The Huffington Post in a Reddit message. "He always carried this type of humor and energy with him and was very fun to be around," he wrote.
Simms is the second Target employee to go viral in as many months. In November, a Target employee named Alex Lee became an internet sensation when his photo got circulated on Twitter. Lee hit it so big that he was swamped with fans and at one point was afraid to leave the house, he told the New York Times .

This post has been updated to include a quote from Simms, as well as his full name.

Mexico Releases Horrifying New Details In Missing Students CaseMexico: Bodies Of Missing Students Abducted By Police Were Burned
Reuters
reddit
A bone fragment belonging missing student Alexander Mora is displayed on a television screen during a press conference by Mexico's Attorney General, Jesus Murillo Karam in Mexico City, Wednesday Dec. 7, 2014. Attorney General Murillo Karam confirmed Sunday that one of the college students missing since September, has been identified among charred remains found several weeks ago near a garbage dump. He said the student is Alexander Mora, based on material extracted from the bone fragment and anal
(Reuters) - Mexican authorities on Sunday said that mounting evidence and initial DNA tests confirmed that 43 trainee teachers who were abducted by corrupt police 10 weeks ago were incinerated at a garbage dump by drug gang members.
Attorney General Jesus Murillo told reporters that one of the students had been identified by experts in Austria from a bone fragment in a bag of ash and bits of burned tire found in a river where drug gang members said they tossed the students remains.
"This scientific proof confirms that the remains found at the scene coincide with the evidence of the investigation," Murillo said. "We will continue with the probe until all the guilty have been arrested."
President Enrique Pena Nieto is facing his deepest crisis over his government's handling of the probe. The case laid bare Mexico's deep problem of impunity and corruption and it has overshadowed Pena Nieto's efforts to focus on economic reforms.
One month ago, Murillo said that drug gang members had confessed to murdering the students and burning their bodies in a pyre of tires at an isolated dump.
But parents of the missing students have refused to accept the government's version and at a demonstration in Mexico City on Saturday night they said they would continue to demand more answers even after they had heard word of the DNA test results.
The apparent massacre has spurred widespread and sometimes violent protests throughout Mexico. Federal authorities waited 10 days after the students disappearance to intervene in the case, insisting it was a local matter.
Murillo said that 80 people have been detained in the probe, including the mayor of Iguala and his wife who are accused of ordering the police to get rid of the students from a radical left-wing college after they staged a demonstration in his town. Murillo promised more arrests, including 16 fugitive policemen.
During the search for the students in the state of Guerrero, dozens more bodies were discovered in mass graves. More than 100,000 people have been killed in Mexico in gang-related violence since 2007.
"There is a lot of rage, but it is not just this case," said political science student Jimena Rodriguez at the Saturday night march. "There are so many missing, and they do not have the least interest in really investigating."

DOUBLE-DOUBLE SATISFACTIONEmail
Comment
You probably wouldn't expect a fast-food joint to rank higher than Facebook or Apple as a great place to work.
But In-N-Out Burger topped both of those companies, and many others, in a new ranking by the job site Glassdoor of the 50 best places to work. In-N-Out placed eighth on the list, which was topped by Google and the Boston consulting firm Bain & Co.
The regional burger chain, which has restaurants in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Texas, is the only fast-food company on the list. It didn’t crack the top 50 last year.
Glassdoor’s ranking was based entirely on employee feedback. Glassdoor collected more than 800,000 reviews from workers about the pros and cons of their jobs; how satisfied they are with their company; whether they would recommend a friend work there; and information about pay, benefits, opportunities to advance and work-life balance.
Companies were ranked based on their average employee ratings on a 5-point scale, with 5 being total job satisfaction. The full ranking, which only includes companies with at least 1,000 workers, can be found below.
In an industry known for low salaries and poor treatment of workers In-N-Out is often recognized for playing against type. According to Carl Van Fleet, vice president of planning and development at In-N-Out, the starting wage at the company is $10.50 an hour. That's a lot higher than the median hourly pay for fast-food workers nationwide, which is $8.94 an hour.
"We strive to create a working environment that is upbeat, enthusiastic and customer-focused," Van Fleet wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. "A higher pay structure is helpful in making that happen, but it is only part of our approach. It is equally important to treat our associates well and maintain that positive working environment in all of our restaurants."
Just last week, fast food workers in 190 cities across the country protested the industry's treatment of workers. But In-N-Out workers seem to be pretty satisfied with the company.
“Great pay rates, fantastic hours, calm and comfortable atmosphere, plenty of benefits, full of opportunity, friendly coworkers, overall very happy with the experience I gain here,” a part-time associate who has been working at In-N-Out for less than a year said in a review posted on Glassdoor. The jobs site moderates worker reviews and verifies users based on their email addresses or Facebook profiles.
A full-time associate who has worked at the company for more than five years listed the following pros: “The values of the company, the way they treat their associates, paid holidays off, atmosphere.”
One of the cons of the job, according to Glassdoor, is that it's difficult to get a full-time job there. Workers also complained about a strict dress code , standing for long hours, and that you often smell like burgers at the end of a shift. But those usually come with the fast-food territory.

It s Time to Put a Price on Carbonreddit
Nelson Mandela, who founded The Elders in 2007, believed transformative leaders needed the generosity and courage to see beyond narrow self-interest. No challenge requires these qualities as much, or as urgently, as climate change.
As the complex negotiations between 195 member state representatives gather pace in Lima, Peru, at the 20th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP-20), we once again raise our hopes that this time things will be different, and a draft framework will emerge that will be the basis of a new Climate Agreement that nations sign up to in Paris in 2015.
There has been progress. Commitments by China, the United States and the European Union to cut emissions have given the current UN's climate change talks in Lima momentum. But while an important and welcome step, they do not meet the scale of the reductions needed. Nor have other major economies yet matched their promises.
And while such headline commitments are, of course, essential, they will not be sufficient to protect our world from potential climate disaster. Agreement must also be reached on the mechanisms to deliver these cuts, how they will be assessed, reported and enforced.
There is a huge amount of detailed work required covering a wide range of areas.
We need as well to find the means to help poorer countries cope with climate change which is not just inevitable but is already taking place. Climate change is not an abstract concern or future threat. It is happening now.
According to the UN's World Meteorological Organisation, 2014 is on course to be the hottest on record. It would mean fourteen of the 15 warmest years ever recorded have occurred in the 21st century.
With rising temperatures, just as the experts predicted, has come more frequent and more extreme weather.  Droughts are longer, storms are more severe. As always, it is the poorest and most vulnerable who suffer most. Yet we have failed badly so far to face up to either the urgency or magnitude of this crisis.
This is why, building on Lima, a universal climate agreement must be signed at the COP-21 talks in Paris next year. Kyoto did not bring about the scale of change we needed. We dare not make the same mistake again. Another failure or further delay would sentence our world to a deeply worrying future.
The over-riding need is agreement on a goal for all nations to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This must be done in a way which is equitable and supportive of the development aspirations of all countries.
What is also now clear is that at the heart of the process must be a binding international agreement on pricing carbon emissions.  Without such an agreement, the change of behaviour to drive the shift to low-carbon economies simply will not happen.
Pricing carbon incorporates the principle that the polluter pays, building incentives and penalties into the process. It enables risk to be quantified and will help deliver the public and private investment needed to transform our economies.
To achieve these goals, the price of carbon needs to be credible and predictable, sufficient to induce the necessary reduction in carbon emissions and encourage investment in climate mitigation. Accurately pricing carbon will accelerate development of alternative sources of energy. In addition, transparent compliance and measurement mechanisms need to be agreed that will hold markets and nations to account and signal progress towards climate goals.
Countries are, of course, at different levels of development and have different responsibilities for the carbon already in our atmosphere. But the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibility' means that, while there must be flexibility on adoption, all countries must be ready to accept carbon pricing and reduce emissions.
Justice, however, also requires richer countries to help those behind them on the development path. They need support to meet the ambitions of their citizens in a sustainable way but also to protect their citizens from the impact of climate change.
At the moment, the Green Climate Fund set up to deliver these goals has only $9.3 billion of the anticipated $100 billion needed each year by 2020. This is hardly likely to encourage developing economies to make the changes needed.  Bolstering the fund will require significant private capital and investment that will be fostered by agreeing on a meaningful and equitable price on carbon by the Paris COP in December 2015.
The Elders understand the short-term electoral pressures on the world's political leaders. But now is the time to find the vision and courage -- the 'generous accommodation' of which Mandela spoke -- to raise sights and ambitions.
The costs of failure are immense but so are the rewards. We will not only fulfill our responsibilities to future generations but show how our shared values can be put into action effectively in a globalized economy. Putting a price on carbon is key to this ambition.  Efforts to reduce poverty and make the economy greener can, unlike what many suggest, be compatible.

Wall Street Moves In for the Killreddit
It's been six years since Wall Street's recklessness and criminal fraud caused trillions of dollars in economic damage and nearly shattered the global economy. The 2008 financial crisis opened millions of Americans' eyes to the widespread corruption and mismanagement in the financial industry, and built public support for stronger bank oversight. Initial steps were taken in that direction, primarily in the Dodd/Frank financial reform bill, and more remains to be done.
But today Wall Street is on the offensive. Banks are expanding their political influence, fighting to roll back the measures already in place and working to block further reforms. In our money-driven political system, they have plenty of ammunition with which to wage their battle.
Bankers still hold powerful government positions, just as they've done in the last several Republican and Democratic administrations. "Regulatory capture" has led top banking watchdogs to claim that they are not " cops on the beat ," when that is exactly what they're supposed to be. And after this year's Republican electoral sweep, Wall Street is moving to consolidate its wins.
This week its allies were trying to kill a Dodd/Frank provision designed to reduce the need for future big-bank bailouts. Negotiators seeking to avert a government shutdown had inserted a provision into the compromise agreement that would once again allow the country's too-big-to-fail banks to gamble on derivatives -- the exotic financial instruments that helped precipitate the last crisis -- with funds that are insured by taxpayers.
The amendment in question, which would have repealed a measure known as the "swaps push-out rule," was largely written by lobbyists for Citigroup . It was backed by Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee. Hensarling's Democratic counterpart, Rep. Maxine Waters, released a statement that said in part:
"I am disgusted that in a back room deal, some members and lobbyists for the largest banks are trying to undo a seminal component of the Wall Street Reform Act ... I'm disheartened that, by trying to pass this repeal, this Congress is risking our homes, jobs and retirement savings once again."
Republicans, led by Hensarling, are the bad actors in this week's drama. But party lines get murky where Wall Street money is concerned. The Citigroup amendment was originally introduced by Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat, and there are Democrats on both sides of this battle. As Rep. Waters declared in her statement,
"Although Democrats enacted comprehensive oversight and changes for our derivatives markets as part of Dodd-Frank, some are using critical legislation that is necessary to keep our government open as an opportunity to ram through harmful deregulation."
But, while some Democrats are aiding Wall Street in this effort, others are resisting it. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has blasted the idea , as have Sens. Sherrod Brown, Jeff Merkley, and Carl Levin .
This issue is extremely important on its own merits. But it's also a test of Wall Street's influence as Republicans prepare to assume control over the Senate. Bankers have the opportunity to consolidate their control over government to an extent we haven't seen since 2008. The only thing standing in their way is a phalanx of progressive leaders on the Hill.
No wonder they and their media allies have been so vituperative and personal toward Sen. Warren lately. They have attempted and failed, sometimes embarrassingly , to discredit Warren for opposing the appointment of yet another banker to a senior opposition post. That banker, Antonio Weiss, isn't qualified for the job he's being offered. He has helped corporations evade US taxes and is being offered $20 million by his Wall Street employer should he succeed in becoming a "public servant."
The viciousness of the attacks on Warren should be seen for what they are: the frustrated outcries of Wall Street sycophants who saw the financial industry's complete political resurrection at hand, only to be thwarted by what they perceive as the obstinacy of progressives like Warren.
We are at a pivotal moment in the struggle to restrain the financial industry's toxic blend of recklessness and political influence. Bankers have escaped criminal or financial accountability for their crimes, despite failures and frauds on a scale so epic it's difficult for most of us to envision. And, although the 2008 crisis discredited the bank-friendly ideology of deregulation, that ideology is once again being promoted aggressively in politics and the media.
Bankers have had many political victories since their moment of financial failure, but those victories have been incomplete -- until now. Has their hour come around at last?
If there's one thing bankers understand, it's timing. Wall Street isn't just trying to get another friend into a powerful position and win back its taxpayer guarantees. It wants to make its own agenda appear inevitable. It wants to crush an incipient populist resistance before it gains more momentum. It's moving in for the kill.
That's why it's so important to stop the Citigroup amendment and block the appointment of Antonio Weiss. Both actions are more than justified on their own merits. But the stakes are even larger than they may initially appear. And if the banks win, everybody else loses.

Volunteers May Have Employee Legal Statusreddit
The federal Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently decided that volunteering Catholic nuns were not "employees" entitled to religious discrimination protections ( Sister Michael Marie v. American Red Cross ). Organizations utilizing volunteers, interns, and independent contractors should consider what characteristics create an "employee."
In brief summary, the current case arose because the nuns received performance reviews that would have entitled them to a promotion in responsibilities but they were instead terminated. They alleged religious discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII addresses actions by employers with 15 or more employees.
The Court noted that it is possible for a monetarily uncompensated volunteer to legally qualify as an employee. Past cases often involved eligibility for workers' compensation benefits for an injury. Volunteers that are provided a path to future employment within the organization are frequently considered "compensated."  However, general workplace experience and training is typically insufficient to constitute compensation. Whether or not the volunteer received "compensation" is a factual question for the jury. While some courts consider compensation as the determining factor in creating employment status, the Sixth Circuit considers compensation as simply one of a number of factors.
The relative weight to be given various factors depends on the situation. These factors include, among others, control over how the task is performed,  the required skills, the source of tools, duration of the relationship, how payment occurs, and if the work is part of the organization's regular business.
The Sixth Circuit in this case considered the degree of control that the organization had over assignments, including the time, place and manner of performance, to be significant. Control implies the right to fire that results in a loss of income. Volunteers receive no income and the organization lacks the traditional leverage that firing provides. In the current case, the organization did not set a fixed work schedule or closely control the nuns' activities. The nuns had considerable discretion in when and how they volunteered. Hence, there was a low degree of control.
Organizations should consider what distinguishes their volunteers from ordinary employees. Are volunteers promised a path to employment and do they receive items such as health insurance, gasoline money, gift cards, etc.? Are the volunteers on a fixed schedule and do they perform essential services that an employee might otherwise perform? Are the volunteers evaluated and controlled like employees?
If a volunteer is in fact an employee then employee protection laws such as minimum wage and overtime, as well as Title VII, will frequently apply. Consult experienced legal counsel to review your specific situation.

CBOE to offer options on MSCI indexesCBOE to offer options on MSCI indexes
Chicago Board Options Exchange
Chicago Board Options Exchange
CBOE Holdings Inc , which runs the largest U.S. stock-options market, said on Wednesday it has entered a licensing deal with stock market indexes provider MSCI Inc which would allow the CBOE to offer options on six MSCI indexes.
Under the agreement, the CBOE plans to offer options trading in the MSCI EAFE Index , and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index , in the first quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory approval, it said in a statement.
0
These options will see some interest but many will continue to use the iShares MSCI EM ETF and iShares MSCI EAFE fund options, since these are listed across all exchanges, said Fred Ruffy, options strategist at WhatsTrading.com.
Exchange-traded funds tracking these two indexes are among the most popularly traded ETFs on a daily basis. Options on the EEM and the EFA are also very popular and are usually among the most traded options on any given day.
Options on the MSCI ACWI Index , MSCI USA Index , MSCI World Index and the MSCI ACWI ex-US Index will be listed later in 2015, CBOE Holdings said.
The options will be listed for trading solely on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the CBOE said.

Cong slams PM for using Army as tool forpolitickingBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:43 am
A day after it approached the Election Commission seeking action against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for dragging the Army into the election campaign in J&K, the Congress Wednesday stepped up its attack on him. It accused the Prime Minister of using the Army as a “tool for politicking” and called it “deplorable”.
“It is deeply regrettable that no less than the head of government has used the Army as cannon fodder during a political, electoral campaign and that too in a sensitive region like Jammu and Kashmir,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said. The Prime Minister, at an election rally in Srinagar earlier this week, had described the recent Army action against two of its personnel over the killing of two boys in Chattergam as a “feat” of his government.
Claiming that the Prime Minister has used this incident as an “electoral tool for political purposes”, the Congress had Tuesday approached the EC demanding action against him. Its argument was that bringing the Army into a political controversy or an election campaign was a violation of the model code of conduct.
“An anonymous Army is the biggest guarantee of democracy… politicisation of the Army, even remotely bringing the Army into the political discourse, is not only condemnable but dangerous,” Singhvi said.

First denial  now OK: 1984 riotreliefWritten by Amitav Ranjan , Vijaita Singh | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 3:14 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 8:03 am
A month after it denied taking a decision on enhancing the compensation for the next of kin of the 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims , the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Tuesday wrote to the Finance Ministry seeking release of funds for disbursement during the current fiscal.
READ:  Everyone in Tilak Vihar has a 1984 story
Sources said the Cabinet today cleared the decision to provide extra compensation.
In his letter dated December 9, Home Secretary Anil Goswami asked Expenditure Secretary Ratan P Watal to sanction the “rehabilitation package to provide relief to the victims of 1984 riots” as approved by the Centre.
Sources said Goswami has sought release of an extra Rs 66.5 crore from the non-plan budget to pay Rs 5 lakh each to the next of kin of 3,325 victims of the anti-Sikh riots, triggered by the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
READ:  30 years on, ‘proof’ sought for bodies never found
Goswami’s letter runs contrary to his ministry’s clarification to the Election Commission on November 3 that it had not taken a decision on providing extra compensation and had thus, not violated the Model Code of Conduct.
The news was not formally announced by the MHA but officials gave the information to sections of the media, including this newspaper, a day before the 30th anniversary of the anti-Sikh riots on October 31. The EC had reprimanded the MHA and sought a confirmation since it “did not come across any denial from the government in the electronic media”.
On November 25, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju told the Lok Sabha that the government had not enhanced the compensation for the 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims.
Goswami’s letter seems to be timed to ensure that the funds are released after the Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand polls get over, but before the Delhi assembly election is announced.
Sources said the MHA in October approved an enhancement in the relief from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh under a central assistance scheme for the families of the victims of terrorist, communal and Naxal violence.
In 2006, the previous UPA government announced a Rs 717 crore rehabilitation package for anti-Sikh riots victims after the Nanavati Commission, set up to probe the riots, submitted its report. Of the 3,325 victims, 2,733 were killed in Delhi alone while the remaining victims were from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states.

Comment
By Serena Maria Daniels
DETROIT, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Detroit will officially exit the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy later on Wednesday, officials said, allowing Michigan's largest city to start a new chapter with a lighter debt load.
The city, which filed for bankruptcy in July 2013, will shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations.
"We're going to start fresh tomorrow and do the best we can to deliver the kind of services people deserve," said Mayor Mike Duggan.
Once a symbol of U.S. industrial might, Detroit fell on hard times after decades of population loss, rampant debt and financial mismanagement left it struggling to provide basic services to residents.
Later on Wednesday, payments to city creditors will be triggered under a debt adjustment plan confirmed by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge last month.
Most of the settlements with major creditors, including Detroit's pension funds and bondholders, will be paid with a distribution of about $720 million of bonds. The city will also reissue $287 million of existing bonds and borrow about $275 million from Barclays Capital to finance its exit from bankruptcy.
Along with the debt, the exit plan relies heavily on the "Grand Bargain," where foundations, the state and the Detroit Institute of Art will contribute $816 million over time to ease pension cuts and protect city-owned art work from sale. The plan also aims to provide Detroit with $1.7 billion through June 30, 2023, to improve city services and infrastructure.
Wednesday also marks the end of Kevyn Orr's 21-month term as Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager. He told reporters that the city was wrapping up wire transfers, disbursements and other matters to end the historic bankruptcy.
"There may be some other administrative things the court may have to handle but the city will have emerged from bankruptcy," Orr said. "12:01 a.m. tomorrow morning the city will be out of bankruptcy. I will no longer be the emergency manager. I will be unemployed."
Orr's departure returns complete control of Detroit to Duggan and the nine-member city council. However, the city will have a nine-member, state-created oversight board in place to approve financial matters.
In confirming the bankruptcy plan, Judge Steven Rhodes raised questions about possible conflicts of interest from having Duggan and a city council member sit on the board.
"The city is running the city, with some financial oversight on budgetary matters," said Michigan Governor Rick Snyder about the financial review commission. "My goal is probably to have (the commission) be as least active as possible."
The Republican governor told Reuters in an interview that the commission will help ensure Detroit does not slip back into bankruptcy. He also ruled out direct financial aid to the city in the future.
"We're not really aiming to be there as a backup to the city in terms of financial resources," Snyder said. "We're there to be a supportive partner."
He added that many of the other 16 local governments and school districts under state oversight in Michigan are "transitioning out of their problems" without the aid of bankruptcy.
"People should not be aspiring to go into bankruptcy to solve your problems. It's tough process and it's a last resort."
Orr said court-ordered mediation on fees paid to consultants during the bankruptcy process was continuing on Wednesday. Outside lawyers and consultants charged the city more than $140 million, sparking protests from Duggan. Orr said some of the issues were "resolved last week."
With the exit, "all of the consultants are being phased out pretty quickly," Duggan said. (Writing and additional reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago and Lisa Lambert in Washington; editing by Matthew Lewis)

It's the end of the line for a '90s teen darling. Delia's is preparing to shut down.
Delia’s announced Friday that it is liquidating all of its merchandise and plans to soon file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It had been looking for a buyer after running low on cash, decimated by four straight years of declining sales.
A Delia's Catalog. (Photo: Delia's)
The store, which styles itself as dELiA*s and is best known for its once-popular catalog, had its heyday in the 1990s selling that decade’s flashy fashion items like maxi skirts, neon track jackets and baggy pants. Launched as a direct sales business in 1993, it was adored by teen girls as a place to buy all the cutesy items they wanted, and the brand prospered as it delivered on all the hot teen trends of the era.
But in the mid-2000s, fashion trends passed it by, and girls abandoned the store for edgier shops like American Apparel, PacSun and Hot Topic. Delia’s put itself on the auction block back in 2011, as fierce competition from newly popular stores like Forever 21 and H&M ate away at its sales. In 2013, Delia’s accumulated just $137 million in sales, down nearly 47 percent from its peak of $258 million in 2006.
A turnaround seemed possible last year, when hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson talked up Delia's potential under new chief executive Tracy Gardner, who came over from J. Crew and hoped to spark a renaissance of sorts.
Delia’s retained its upbeat style to the end, though without the vibrant, in-your-face neon color palette that defined the 90s. It sells items like sweaters with heart prints, flowery tops and graphic tees with “Whatever” emblazoned on their fronts.
But the company wasn't able to keep up with the times. As former Delia’s CEO Walter Killough told BuzzFeed as the chain was on its deathbed: “It looks like Delia’s is just another small company, in the teen space, that did not have the store and e-commerce productivity to absorb the revolutionary changes that are going on in the shopping patterns of the teen shopper.”
Delia's found its home in shopping malls, attracting girls to stores with its snazzy catalog. But over time, suburbia ditched malls to shop on the Internet. As of August, Delia’s had 95 stores left-- down from 115 in 2011. In February, Delia’s had 499 full-time and 1,190 part-time employees, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The company “does not anticipate any value will remain from the bankruptcy estate” for shareholders. A representative for Delia’s did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

20 Career-Boosting Actions to Complete Before New Year s EveThe statistics confirm: It's true.
December often feels like one of the "sleepiest" months of the year -- full of holidays, lovely food and long, cozy nights.
But as tempting as it may be to hole up with a big mug of cocoa and pine-scented candles, try not to hibernate all month long. Use the next few weeks wisely -- and get a head start on your job hunt!
We've got 20 days left in the month of December. Here are 20 career-boosting actions to complete before the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve...
1.  Send a "thank you" note to a colleague, manager or mentor who helped or inspired you, this year.
2.  Congratulate someone on their career success, this year. By celebrating others, you'll reinforce that you're a positive, encouraging person -- two qualities that are on every employer's wish list!
3.  Order beautiful new business cards. (And then: revamp your personal website. )
4. Reach out to five people you'd like to connect with in 2015 and get a coffee date, walking date, yoga date or dinner party on the calendar.
5. Clean out your inbox and unsubscribe from mailing lists that clutter your inbox (and waste your time).
6. Choose two skills that you're going to focus on improving in 2015. Then, decide how you're going to develop those skills and block out the time on your calendar, right now. (A class... a seminar... a weekly writing group... whatever makes sense for you.)
7.  Write down your biggest successes from the past 12 months. Read your list out loud. Practice describing those "big wins" with confidence -- as if you're telling each story to a hiring manager during an interview.
8.  Write down your biggest mistakes from the past twelve months -- and what you learned from each one. Read that list out loud, too. (Sooner or later, a job interviewer is going to ask, "What's your greatest weakness?" or "Describe a time when you made a mistake." Prep your answers in advance!)
9.  Find a beautiful new template for your résumé. (Here are 275 free templates you can use!)
10.  Read these 43 résumé tips that will get you hired. Revamp your résumé accordingly.
11.  Contact an expert résumé writer to help you, if you're still feeling totally stuck. (Sometimes, a second pair of eyes can make all the difference.)
12.  Learn how to ace the 50 most common job interview questions .
13.  Upgrade your professional wardrobe. The old adage, "Dress for the job you want, not the job you have"... is quite true! (Here's some style inspiration for job hunters.)
14.  If you work from home, boost your focus by making your office a calmer, quieter space. Cut noise with carpeting, thick curtains or white noise machines.
15.  Invest in a standing desk . (You won't believe the health benefits. )
16.  Reorganize your workspace. Remove clutter. Add beauty. Pin your goals or a project manifesto right in front of you, so you see the words, every day. (Need some inspiration? These workspaces are breathtakingly beautiful.)
17.  Google yourself and see what comes up. Unflattering photos? Questionable social media content? Snarky blog comments? Put yourself in a recruiter's shoes and make sure your online footprint makes a good impression.
18.  Take your LinkedIn presence to the next level by adding a personal note when you send out invitations to join your network. (Not many people do this, which is a missed opportunity!)
19.  Read a few career-boosting classics, like Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and Dale Carnegie's How To Win Friends And Influence People. (Another top pick: It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want To Be . It's one of the world's top-selling books of all time... for a reason!)
20.  Be brave and start spreading the word. Reach out to 5 people you trust and tell them you're ready to take your career to the next level. Ask them to keep you in mind and give you a "heads up" if new opportunities cross their path. Check in again in January, after the holiday haze has subsided.
It's been reported that 80 percent of jobs are never posted or advertised publicly .
These kinds of jobs can only be discovered through word-of-mouth connections, personal introductions and referrals.
So by all means: spruce up your résumé, write down your big wins, de-clutter your workspace and dial up your wardrobe.
But more than anything?
Spend the next 20 days re-connecting with people you admire and strengthening the relationships in your professional network.
You never know what one follow-up email, "thank you" note or holiday card can do for your career.
Good luck. Here's to an incredible New Year!

6 Tips for Indian Managers New to Americareddit
As Indo-U.S. trade blossoms in 2015, with President Obama reciprocating Prime Minister Modi's visit and trade barriers dropping further, many Indian business people will venture to America for the first time. If you are one of them, here are six tips, based on my observations as an advisor to top U.S. companies, on how you may avoid some common stumbles.
It's all about size
Everything in America seems big at first: the houses, the portions at restaurants, the office complexes, even the parking garages. You may be told that California alone has about as many cars as all of India (about 15 million) and about as many commercial flights. I can readily fly out of five different airports ( Los Angeles, Long Beach, Orange County, Burbank and Ontario) located less than hour's drive from me, compared to just one in any Indian city. It is relatively easy to adjust to these differences, but it takes many Indians a while to fathom the travel time between major cities in a country three times the area of India (and that's not counting Alaska).
If you have a meeting with me, you can't just fly up to Boston for a quick second meeting. From the Sheraton Cerritos next to my office in California, it will take you more than eight hours to reach Cambridge, Massachusetts. Even if you leave your hotel at 5 AM Pacific Time (which is already 8 AM EST), you won't be checking into a room on the east coast until the late afternoon Boston time. On a USA map, Las Vegas and Phoenix look awfully close to Los Angeles, but it takes 4 hours of driving to reach the gambling capital, not counting for traffic. And Phoenix is even further.
Communicating Effectively
Email, being asynchronous, is more effective than phone calls for most routine communications with Americans. But to be most effective, you should strip out verbosity and floweriness from most business communications ("First of all, it is a pleasure and honor for me to introduce to you our esteemed company, which started in the business of exporting ...." began one missive that I received last week).
Don't use SMS-like abbreviations in your email. (Are u avail for a mtg 2 discuss your pdt dvlpmnt needs?). Most Americans over 30 years old are far more comfortable with email than SMS (which they call texting) for business communication. Until you are seasoned in dealing with American businesses, your language will inevitably include terms that are unfamiliar to your readers (do the needful, the same is included in the annexure). Don't handicap yourself further by using what looks like code to many American readers.
Texting has become a bit more acceptable in the business world in America today, but I still caution Indians from relying on it too much. First of all, when you text from your Airtel, Reliance or Vodafone device even with global roaming enabled, there are instances where the reply may get dropped in the ether and never reach you. If you use a temporary U.S. number via Matrix or other service, keep in mind that the same number may be assigned to someone else a few days later and you may miss your incoming messages again.
Sameness
The largest economy in the world is also egalitarian and consistent on many dimensions.
CEOs and receptionists may dress and talk alike at a company picnic. They may address each other informally even at work. Some Indians jump to the conclusion that the Chief Sales Office that they met is not respected in the company, simply because a junior employee corrected him in front of a visitor. Deferential behavior is not generally rewarded in America, at least not over accuracy.
In India, our map of communications is sometimes populated with ethnic or regional textures (Gujaratis are a certain way. Muslims will react to something. People educated in an "English Medium" school look at things in this way). Such differences are largely cloaked or relatively unimportant in India. It is true that people from Louisiana may talk differently from Bostonians and that New Yorkers may always seem in a hurry. It is also true that many laws in America vary from state to state. But for most business issues, America is a single, consistent market. Relationships and contracts can be built or broken in the same way across all fifty states. By no means do I want to imply that differences don't exist in America; I am simply making the point that you don't need to become fluent in these differences for initial success.
Inequality of Knowledge
A well-read Indian will probably know the names of several members of President Obama's cabinet as well as stories about famous American CEO's such as Larry Page of Google or Fred Smith of FedEx. Don't assume that your American counterpart will recognize the name Nirmala Sitharaman or Ravi Ruia, however.
A famous TV host who interviewed me on a live show in the wake of the 26/11 terrorist attacks thought that Mumbai and Bombay were two different Indian cities. The studio edited that out in the two minute delay loop. But I don't mean to berate her at all. Most American media and most American conversations are about domestic events. As I write this, I looked at the webpage for ABC World News Tonight ("More Americans get their news from ABC than from any other source" is their tagline). At the only internationals stories on the main page are about a stabbing in Abu Dhabi and a typhoon in the Philippines.
The rest of the world does not capture the headlines unless there is a major calamity. So as a US-India consultant, I was slightly disappointed but not surprised to see that the September visit by Prime Minister Modi received almost zero coverage in mainstream American media, with the exception of the Huffington Post and the Wall Street Journal.
Be ready as an Indian visitor to explain basic things about India to your counterparts. Don't be surprised or offended by any questions. Instead take them as an opportunity to inform, entertain and perhaps educate your business colleagues.
A "Today" Culture
In India, our lives are typically immersed in history and context. By comparison, America is much more about the here and now. As the debate rages about President Obama's executive actions on immigration for example, there is scant perspective from the lessons of the Simpson-Mazzoli Act of 1986 or the sweeping changes wrought in 1964. If you are an avid watcher of American politics, you may remember "Joe the Plumber" from Senator John McCain's failed presidential bid in 2008 but most Americans have long since forgotten him.
We took a major American company to India last year. In planning the engagement, senior management told me with absolute certainty that this was the corporation's first encounter with India at any level. Much to the client's surprise, my team in India discovered during their outreach that our client had launched a concerted but quiet effort four years earlier and then put it on ice during the financial crisis. Most of the leaders of the earlier effort were still at the company but had changed roles. The institutional knowledge of the earlier foray had evaporated. Our advance work in Mumbai saved them from an embarrassing meeting with a partner they had earlier rejected.
The good news is that you are not at a disadvantage because your company is new to America. Incidentally, most Americans have been treated by a physician of Indian origin at some point and usually harbor some good will as a result. They may not realize that the motel they stayed in is owned by a Patel, or that the CEO of their favorite potato chip company (Indra Nooyi) is from India, but the close personal interaction of Indian medics is not easily forgotten and has been further reinforced by years of watching Dr. Sanjay Gupta on CNN
Building Bridges
Socially most American men connect to each other via their fandom of professional sports, largely (American) football and baseball and to some extent (ice) hockey and basketball. The travails of the West Indies cricket team and even the fate of Real Madrid or Chelsea mean little in America.
When Amitabh Bachchan appeared in the latest version of The Great Gatsby movie, I actually had to explain to most of my American friends that he is bigger than Tom Cruise and Leonard DiCaprio put together in India. The last Indian movie that many American may remember was in fact directed by Danny Boyle: Slumdog Millionaire.
Religion and politics are generally considered off-limits topics in business in America. So what do you talk about over lunch or dinner with your American counterparts?
This is a tough subject.
Thanks to LinkedIn and Facebook, you may find that your counterparts have disclosed some of their interest online and if you like the same books or vacation destinations, by all means start with those.
Otherwise I suggest starting with food and family. Most Americans have at least encountered Tandoori Naan and I suggest that you research salads, pies, pot roasts and other items beyond burgers and pizzas prior to leaving India. You can start a discussion about family with some gentle self-disclosure ("My husband comes from a large joint family whereas I grew up in Mumbai with just a brother and my parents." Or "My daughter is planning to apply for college to London and Los Angeles").
Divorce and remarriage often produce blended families in America and many couples may have children out of wedlock. Same sex couples are not rare either. Your counterpart will decide how much to self-disclose. My advice is to be non-judgmental and measured in your question. It's ok to ask "What sports does your daughter enjoy?" but hold back from querying an openly gay man if his sexual orientation holds him back in his career.
Conclusion
To summarize, be aware of America's vast size, learn to use email to your full advantage, rejoice that America is more homogenous than Europe, don't be upset that Americans don't know India well, recognize the important of "today" and prepare carefully to build relationships. This list is by no means complete, and I also welcome any corrections based on your experience.

While I would never claim to know the absolute secret sauce on spotting talent -- this is an art form many claim to have but few do -- I believe with the help of some hindsight and an amazing network of other business owners, I can identify six common attributes that I've seen across the board in the talent I've worked with for the past ten years.
Live curiously. We live in a business climate of constant change. Employers are actively looking at prospects to try and understand their ability to adapt and evolve not only in their individual job role but with the company as it continues to adapt and evolve. I think about this trait less as an ability that some people have and some people don't but as a lifestyle choice. Live outside of your comfort zone beginning today. If you normally walk the same path to work every day, change it up. If you exclusively play sports, take an improv class. Changing up your everyday habits might ultimately be the path to trip on the passion you've been seeking.
Use "we" over "I." There's no "I" in team and for most organizations, teamwork is the fuel that drives the culture. From an employer's point of view, they are looking for candidates who can work well in a team environment and be a positive force in their collaborative environment. In interviews, a great way to demonstrate that you're a great team player is to become very familiar with using the word "we" and ditching "I". Begin to say, "Our team worked on a challenging project. We solved that challenging problem by..."  At our agency, we've always lived by a simple mantra in hiring: We don't hire shining stars, we hire people that help us create shining stars.
Acknowledge that how you do anything is how you do everything. Employers are looking for consistency in behavior when meeting prospects. We've all heard the career advice to show up on time, confirm the exact spelling of your contact and make sure your resume is cleanly aligned on the page. It's simple advice and yes, everyone makes mistakes - but the employer knows human behavior well enough to figure that if you do one thing carelessly, you likely do many things carelessly. I often tell students seeking their first job to take a good look at themselves now and identify their shortcomings in their personal life today. The young man that makes silly typos on college essays today is likely the same young man that is making silly typos in work emails. The young woman that is late getting to class is likely the same young woman who is late getting to meetings.
Live below your means. Employers seek out people who want the job not the need the job and through your approach, they can often easily sense the difference. Anything you can do within your power to live below your means is critical as this is at the root of wanting versus needing. For students and those just starting their career, it's hard to save significant money but it's easy to shoot yourself in the foot by getting yourself into unnecessary debt. Our education system typically doesn't teach personal finance and it's one of the single most common traps graduates fall into. Many of you will go from making no money to more money than you've ever received. Proactively living significantly below your means will ultimately give you the power to worry about what you want to do with your life - not how you are going to make your next car payment.
Learn how to give. Giving your time to a cause greater than yourself is the equivalent of filling up on "super foods" - the benefits are plentiful and too many to define. Everyone can make time to give and charitable groups are often willing to take whatever time you have to give. Employers are looking to understand the kind of person you are and demonstrating your ability to use your time to give back while building great real-life experience is a differentiator I'm surprised more young people don't go after. At times, it's better experience than any internship can offer. There are likely over a handful of non-profit and charitable organizations within a five mile radius of where you are reading this right now who would do anything to get some additional support. Consider knocking on their door.
Believe that you can. The hard truth is that nobody is ever going to tell you what you want to hear. But the reality is that there is no substitute for believing in yourself as you're building a successful, happy, healthy career. Smart, committed, passionate people get jobs and succeed. It's that simple and you must believe that and be willing to put in the work. There is a talent shortage, not a job shortage-and don't let anyone tell you differently. There is no room for bad energy in your life.

My Conversation With Steve Ballmerreddit
Tonight I'm joined by Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft and one of the primary architects of that tech giant's phenomenal success, who is now the new owner of the LA Clippers.  He took over that franchise in the aftermath of the Donald Sterling scandal.  His winning bid -- $2 billion.  That's the highest price ever paid for an NBA franchise, but only a small portion of a fortune said to be in excess of $23 billion.
In the clip below, I ask him about how, under his leadership,  Microsoft stayed at the top of a very competitive, fast-moving industry.

Guardian editor-in-chief Rusbridger to step ...Alan Rusbridger
(Alan Rusbridger said he…)
LONDON: The editor-in-chief of The Guardian newspaper says he will step down after 20 years in the role.
Alan Rusbridger said he would take over as chairman of The Scott Trust , which owns Guardian Media Group and was created to safeguard its journalistic freedom.
Rusbridger's leadership saw the paper expand from a Britain-only newspaper to an international media organisation with a strong web presence.
Rusbridger made headlines last year when he defended the newspaper's publication of files leaked by ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden , saying its coverage has prompted a debate about the extent of intelligence activities and exposed the limits of regulatory laws.
The Guardian said today that Rusbridger will step down next summer. It did not announce a successor.

Why I ve Finally Thrown in the Towel on the TSXreddit
Adherents of index investing in Canada have had a rough month as falling oil prices have inflicted considerable pain on not just the energy sector but the entire Canadian market.  After surveying the landscape I've finally thrown in the towel on the TSX and switched my investing allegiance south of the border to the less oily S&P 500.
Look back over the last few years and the biggest challenge facing oil sands producers would certainly seem to be the inability to get a major new pipeline project approved that would allow the industry to sell its ever expanding production to new markets. Now, however, falling oil prices are changing the conversation that Big Oil is having with the rest of the country about the need to build more pipeline infrastructure. At today's oil prices, the expected doubling of oil sands production over the next decade just isn't in the cards. If oil sands output isn't going up then where exactly is the impetus to break ground on a new pipeline? Indeed, the more relevant issue facing oil sands investors at the moment isn't about how production from northern Alberta might be expanded, but whether the industry's current level of production is sustainable.
When OPEC's decision to keep output quotas unchanged triggered the current slide in oil prices, energy investors around the world began pointing to any number of conspiracy theories that would explain why the oil cartel wouldn't move to safeguard prices. Just why anyone would think it's incumbent on the lowest cost producers in the world, such as Saudi Arabia, to cut production remains unclear.
At current prices, the Saudis are still making a decent margin on every barrel sold. The same can't be said for producers with higher costs, many of whom will soon be squeezed out of the market. Consider Canada's oil sands producers. They're churning out some of the highest cost oil in the world, while at the same time they're fetching one of the lowest prices for every barrel sold. Light sweet crude from a shallow well in Texas fetches a much better price from refiners than the heavy sludge that's being delivered from Canada's oil sands. It's one of the reasons why the benchmark price of oil sands crude trades at such a considerable discount to the price of West Texas Intermediate.
If oil prices stay at their current levels, North American producers will have to start making choices about whether or not to shut in production. If they don't, they run the risk of exacerbating the current glut in world oil markets, which would cause oil prices to fall even further. It's a situation that's reminiscent of the one faced by the global coal industry, which has had to contend with an equally challenging collapse in commodity prices.
Consider the chart of an exchange traded fund that tracks oil sands players, in this case BlackRock's iShares Oil Sands ETF. Since hitting a peak prior to the last recession, it's lost about two-thirds of its value. If oil sands stocks follow the same path as that of fallen stars of the U.S. coal industry, such as Peabody Energy or Arch Coal, their share prices could end up falling by 80 to 90 percent from their highs before the oil market stabilizes at a much lower price level.
That dismal outlook isn't just a problem for investors who hold Suncor, Cenovus, Imperial Oil, Canadian Natural Resources and the like. Canada's biggest oil sands players also number among the country's largest companies of any type. The oil sands is now a large component of Canada's energy sector, which means it's also an out-sized part of the entire TSX Composite Index. Indeed, the energy sector is second only to the financial sector in terms of its weighting in the index. That huge imprint on the TSX means that plunging oil prices are a problem for anyone who owns the broad Canadian market.
I can't imagine that many investors are clamoring to own an oil sands ETF these days, but I do wonder how much more appetite there might be for an ETF that excludes energy names. Such a product would insulate investors from an overweight sector that carries so much downside risk.
Some investors might choose to steer clear of oil sands stocks for environmental or ethical reasons. Personally, I didn't disinvest from the oil sands to save the world. I did it to save my portfolio.

Why the $1.1-tn deal may not avert another US govt shutdownWhy the $1.1 trillion deal may not avert another govt shutdown in the US
AP Dec 11, 2014, 01.18AM IST

Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(The compromise spending…)
WASHINGTON: A $1.1 trillion spending bill that would allow the US government to avoid yet another shutdown faces its first test in the House of Representatives.
The 1,603-page measure will be scrutinized in advance of a House vote Thursday. Support from the top leaders in both the House and the Senate appears to guarantee its passage and prevent a government shutdown Thursday midnight.
Still, conservatives are unhappy because the bill fails to challenge Obama's immigration policy and many Democrats are displeased because it weakens regulation of risky financial instruments.
And on Wednesday, Democratic support for the bill appeared to be fading.
"I'm not going to support it. I've already found lots of provisions that are against the public interest," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen. "I find it surprising that some people are threatening to shut down the government in order to extract big benefits for big banks at the expense of consumers and taxpayers."
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of progressives, blasted the measure as "a deal negotiated behind closed doors that slips in a provision that would let derivatives traders on Wall Street gamble with taxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system.
Conservatives were angry, too.
"Why in the world would we want to lock in federal spending through next September that reflects the priorities of the Democratic Senate that voters just thoroughly repudiated last month?" said Rep. Tom McClintock. "Why in the world would we want to so greatly weaken our position to insist on the complete defunding of the president's unconstitutional act (on immigration) in the next session of Congress?"
The compromise spending bill will permit virtually the entire government to operate normally until the fiscal ends next year on Sept. 30, with the exception of the Homeland Security Department.
Funds for that agency will run out on Feb. 27, when Republicans are expected to try to use the expiration as leverage to force President Barack Obama to roll back a decision suspending the threat of deportation for an estimated 4 million immigrants living in the country illegally.
The measure adheres to tight budget caps negotiated previously between the White House and Republicans. It also includes several provisions to fulfill Republican policy objectives, including significantly weakening new regulations that require banks to set up separate affiliates to deal in the more exotic and riskier forms of complex financial instruments called swaps.
Democrats won budget increases for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; Republicans won a big cut to the Internal Revenue Service budget and a smaller cut for the Environmental Protection Agency.
Democrats blocked the most ambitious attempts by Republicans to thwart Obama administration regulations on greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming; Republicans again won concessions exempting livestock producers from regulations on greenhouse gases.

Watch this Michigan cop hand out presents instead of ticketsBy Sarah Larimer December 10, 2014 Follow @slarimer
City of Lowell police gave Christmas presents to drivers after stopping them for minor infractions in Michigan. (City of Lowell)
 
So! Holiday viral videos. They’re kind of a thing. Perhaps you remember the WestJet Christmas Miracle . Of course you do. It was super charming.
Anyway, here’s another one — this time starring a Michigan police officer.
Before we even start: I know what you’re thinking, because I’m thinking it, too. There are a lot of serious, important questions being asked these days about law enforcement in America , and you can’t watch this without thinking of all that.
A detective for the Lowell Police Department told MLive that he hoped the video would help “put police in a better light.” I’ll leave it to you to decide if it does. I’m just here as the holiday viral video messenger.
Here’s the general idea: Officer Scot VanSolkema stopped drivers in Lowell, Mich., for what appeared to be minor traffic infractions. During the conversation that followed, he’d ask about their holiday hopes and dreams. What they wanted, what their kids wanted, that kind of stuff.
And these people were pretty honest in their responses. They mentioned toys and electronics. Some told the officer that the presents might not be under the tree this year. You know how it goes. Are you really going to give a 5-year-old an electronic scooter?
YES YOU ARE. Because look what that police officer has! Happy holidays, lady! And there was no ticket issued. What a day.
Here’s how the video came together, according to MLive :
About two months ago, Lowell Police were approached by West Michigan native and entrepreneur Rob Bliss, who creates viral videos through his company, Rob Bliss Creative. The idea was to produce a project that would show police in a different light.
Bliss had teamed with UPtv Network, which broadcasts movies and television shows designed to be uplifting. UPtv would provide funding for Christmas gifts if Lowell Police would be willing to help with distributing them, said Detective Gordy Lauren.
The department agreed to help and a short video of the Christmas giveaway went live on YouTube Tuesday morning, Dec. 9.

Air Force chief suggests transgender ban may eventually be liftedBy Sandhya Somashekhar December 10, 2014 Follow @sandhyawp

Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James indicated Wednesday that she was open to reviewing the military’s ban on transgender service members.
“From my point of view, anyone who is capable of accomplishing the job should be able to serve,” James told USA Today’s Susan Page . “And so I wouldn’t be surprised if this doesn’t come under review.”
James’s remarks suggest that momentum is once again building for the military to do away with its transgender ban, which remains in place even though gays have been permitted to serve openly since 2011 . Outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and White House officials had expressed an openness to reconsidering the policy earlier this year, but many advocates said progress within the Pentagon appeared to stall this fall.
The Williams Institute, a think tank that studies the gay community, estimates that there are 15,500 transgender members of the military . Over the past two years, advocates say about two dozen people have been dismissed for being transgender. At the same time, many military members say they have noticed a greater openness within their ranks, with some transgender people serving with the knowledge of their peers, superiors and doctors .
In the interview, James said the policy is “likely to come under review in the next year or so. So I think we should stand by, and times change, and we’ll just have to see what happens there.”

Off-spinners face turning point in crackdownTweet
0
Kane Williamson.NEW DELHI - Off-spinners could be in danger of becoming an endangered species as exponents fall by the wayside in the recent crackdown on illegal bowling actions by cricket's world governing body.
Ever since the International Cricket Council (ICC) accepted a recommendation by its cricket committee in June to punish bowlers with suspect actions, off-spinners have become the main target.
Of the seven bowlers hauled up since then, six were off-spinners: the Pakistani duo of Saeed Ajmal and Mohammad Hafeez , Sri Lanka's Sachitra Senanayake, Kane Williamson of New Zealand, Zimbabwe's Prosper Utseya and Sohag Gazi of Bangladesh.
The seventh, Al-Amin Hossain of Bangladesh, who was cleared of any wrongdoing, was a fast bowler.
On Tuesday, the ICC allowed Senanayake and Williamson to resume bowling in international cricket, saying they had undergone remedial work and remodelled their actions which were now legitimate.
But the governing body warned that umpires were "still at liberty to report these bowlers in future if they believe the bowler is displaying a suspect action."
The crackdown has wrecked Pakistan's spin attack, even though they are hopeful that Ajmal, the top-ranked one-day bowler, will be allowed to play in next year's World Cup once he is re-tested.
There is also a question mark over the participation of second-ranked Sunil Narine of the West Indies in the sport's showpiece event that takes place in Australia and New Zealand from February 14.
Narine was withdrawn from a one-day series in India in October and has not been picked for the upcoming Tests in South Africa after being reported by umpires during the Champions League Twenty20 tournament in September.
Even though Narine is not barred from playing international cricket, it is plausible that a worried West Indies team management has wrapped him in cotton wool and asked him to rework his action.
That has left Ravichandran Ashwin of India, Nathan Lyon of Australia and England's James Tredwell as the only established off-spinners still plying their trade.
"Of course illegal actions must be punished, but one gets the feeling umpires look at off-spinners more closely than other bowlers," a former India player, who did not want to be named, told AFP.
"Off-spin is a great art. I hope young bowlers do not get scared of learning it."
'Selective culling'
A deformity in his bowling arm reprieved world bowling record holder Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka after he was called for chucking by Australian umpires in 1995.
The Sri Lankan went on to become the only bowler to claim 800 Test wickets, but other off-spinners like Ajmal have not been so lucky.
The crackdown has largely been welcomed in the cricket community, but some like Ramiz Raja, a former Pakistan captain and now a television commentator, are not entirely convinced.
Raja wants the ICC to quash whispers that Pakistan was not being unfairly targeted.
"First Ajmal and now Hafeez...Pakistan's World Cup build-up has been hit for a six," Raja told AFP.
"It is okay if you want to get rid of illegal actions but there should not be selective culling.
"The process should be open and explained properly so that fans can understand why some bowlers need to be signalled out."
Rules drawn up in November, 2004 state that an action is illegal when the bowler's elbow straightens over the stipulated 15-degree arc in his delivery stride.
The off-spinner's googly -- "the doosra" ("the other one") which turns from leg to off -- is believed to be targeted by umpires on the pretext that it is difficult to bowl one with a legal action.
ICC chief executive David Richardson, a former South African wicket-keeper, has already defended the move to target bowlers just before the World Cup.
"If we decide that there's something wrong with the game, why should we wait until after a World Cup?" Cricinfo quoted Richardson as saying in October. "I think we'd reached the straw that broke the camel's back.
"It's arguable that we should have taken this kind of action earlier. That we can take it on the chin.
"Even I could spin the ball when I threw it in the nets. I could not when I bowled with a straight arm. So why make it easier for most bowlers? The guys who get the wickets must be the best bowlers."

Maoist strike: CRPF blames BSF pilots for misconduct  says firethemWritten by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Raipur |
Posted: December 11, 2014 3:41 am
In an unprecedented action, the CRPF has sought the “immediate dismissal from service” of two BSF pilots, blaming their “deliberate and intentional misconduct” for the Maoist attack in Kasalpad village of Sukma on December 1, in which the CRPF lost 14 of its personnel — its highest single-day casualty in the last four years.
In a letter sent to the CRPF headquarters in New Delhi on December 7, Chhattisgarh’s CRPF IG H S Siddhu has said that a day before the attack, he had repeatedly requested the pilot, Ajay Rama Krishnan, and co-pilot, Bhupinder Kumar, to evacuate eight of his men suffering from malaria, but they did not comply.
Siddhu wrote that the attack could have been averted if the personnel had been evacuated on November 30. On December 1, the CRPF personnel had to spend time sanitising a new “helipad” in Kasalpad village, “exposing the entire party to a grave attack by Naxals”, said the letter, which has been accessed by The Indian Express. “Their (pilots’) inaction amounts to a major failure and was unfortunate and deplorable,” wrote Siddhu.
While Kumar refused to comment, Krishnan could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.
This is the first time that a top officer of a paramilitary force in Chhattisgarh has blamed officers of another central force for a Maoist attack and sought their “immediate dismissal”.
According to Siddhu’s letter, Krishnan was informed on November 29 that the personnel needed to be evacuated, and was requested “to remain ready in the early morning of November 30.” On November 30, the CRPF officers “made many efforts but Captain Ajay Rama Krishnan did not attend to his phone,” wrote Sidhu, adding that the “telephone numbers of these persons are well known to each other”.
The CRPF then reportedly contacted Kumar and told him to keep the helicopter ready for evacuation. Having sanitised an area, the CRPF called up Kumar again at 11.45 am, and “requested (him) to take off (at the) earliest in view of serious condition of the patients,” wrote Siddhu. Kumar handed over the phone to Krishnan, who reportedly informed that he would “not be able to take off without clearance of flight plan.”
Siddhu noted that though the flight plan had already been communicated, Krishnan “stated that for new places, he required to first have a trial landing.”
“This came as a shock”, wrote Siddhu, “since over many years of work, pilots have undertaken emergency casualty/ medical evacuation from new helipads.”
Krishnan later flew the chopper, but “did not come over the prepared helipad” in the forest and “deliberately remained away from that area” before “turning back towards Jagdalpur”, according to Siddhu’s letter.
“The radio operator of the helicopter stated that the pilot refused to land,” wrote Siddhu, adding that it “caused disappointment to troops and exposed them to avoidable extra work of sanitisation.”
Stating that the personnel had “to move a distance of 20 km on foot”, after the failed evacuation, the letter said: “Because of this failure, the whole exercise had to be repeated on December 1, causing extreme inconvenience continued…

Agra a blip  RSS to step up gharwapsiWritten by Shyamlal Yadav | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 3:37 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 7:59 am
RSS affiliate Bajrang Dal drew Opposition fire in Parliament Wednesday for converting 57 Muslim families to Hinduism in Agra but the Parivar fountainhead has already set in motion plans for an intensive ‘ghar wapsi’ — reconversion programme to raise what it calls the Hindu count in the next census.
AGRA:   City tense over conversion row
The RSS has deputed 58 pracharaks under Mukund Rao Panshikar for the task, centred around ‘dharm jagran’ (religious awareness) — this is the maximum number of pracharaks for any single RSS activity. Its ‘ghar wapsi’ plans include a holy dip of the “reconverts” in the Godavari during the Kumbh at Nashik next August. Over 50,000 who “returned” in the last five years are expected to show up.
These plans, RSS sources said, were discussed in Nagpur last month during a conclave of more than 1,200 people involved in ‘dharm jagran’ activities.
The meeting, held from November 7 to 9, was attended by Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, Sarkaryawah Bhaiyaji Joshi and sah-sarkaryawah Krishna Gopal.
Subedar Singh, in-charge of ‘dharm jagran’ in Bihar and Jharkhand, told The Indian Express that a conference was
being held this weekend in Vaishali to discuss “challenges before the Hindus” and “will be attended by 2,000 sadhus”.
“We take strong objection to your use of the ‘conversion’ word. We are not doing any conversion. We are just facilitating the ‘ghar wapsi’ of Hindus who, or their ancestors, had changed faith earlier. We are neither using force nor allurement,” he said.
Singh mentioned the Gaddi project in West Champaran and said Muslims were becoming Yadavs after their “ghar wapsi”.
To spread ‘dharm jagran’ and facilitate ‘ghar wapsi’, the RSS has thought of state-specific strategies. RSS sources claimed that in the last 15 years, Muslims had “reconverted” in large numbers in Beawar district of Rajasthan — Ram Prasad is the pracharak in-charge for such activity in Rajasthan.
In Solapur, Maharashtra, the sources said, several Christians had “returned” to the Hindu fold. “We have over 200 projects for specific castes because once a Christian or Muslim decides to become a Hindu, there is a problem of acceptance by Hindus. We prepare these caste leaders to accept the converts ,” said a pracharak who works for ‘dharm jagran’. Such projects, the pracharak said, involve working among different castes, including Tadvi Bhil, Banjara, Rajput, Brahmin, Yadav, Santhal, Tharu, Meena, Meo and Nat.

Three firms that bought land from Vadra have records riddled withholesWritten by Jay Mazoomdaar , Sweta Dutta | Bikaner/jaipur/new Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 3:30 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 8:24 am
Addresses that are either inaccurate or don’t exist, shareholders who cannot be traced or are clueless about the companies, a mismatch between what’s on paper and what’s on the ground — such discrepancies mark the land transactions between Robert Vadra’s firms and three of the four companies that bought nearly 200 hectares from him.
READ:  In 3 years, Robert Vadra firms reaped up to 600 per cent profit in land deals
These three firms are all linked to Faridabad-based manufacturer of medical disposables Poly Medicure Ltd which is linked to the family of Congress leader and former Rajasthan Finance Minister, the late Chandan Mal Baid.
According to records, the three companies, Allegeny Finlease, Sachchiya Enterprises and VCB Trading, own 14.1%, 3.5% and 4%, respectively, in Poly Medicure. These companies, as first reported in The Indian Express on November 27, paid three to seven times the price at which Vadra companies were buying land in the same areas at around the same time.
Allegeny bought 69.5 hectares, Sachchiya 17.6 hectares and VCB Trading 53.8 hectares from the three Vadra companies Sky Light Hospitality, Sky Light Realty and Blue Breeze Trading in Bikaner’s Kolayat tehsil. The remaining land was bought by Mumbai-based PR Fonroche, a joint venture between PR Clean Energy and French Fonroche Energy.
Himanshu Baid is managing director and his father Jugal Kishore Baid is non-executive director of Poly Medicure. Jugal Kishore is the brother of the late Chandan Mal Baid. Himanshu Baid’s brother Vishal is president (sales & marketing) at Poly Medicure. While Vishal Baid owns VCB Trading with wife Shaily (65.45%, 34.55%), Allegeny and Sachchiya have 41 and 12 shareholders respectively.
The Indian Express found that none of the three companies exists at their registered addresses as mentioned in the Registrar of Companies (RoC) records. Consider the following:
Allegeny Finlease: One Risal Khan of Asaoti village, Faridabad, is one of the two directors of the company and signed the land deals with Vadra’s companies for Allegeny. When The Indian Express visited Khan’s house, he was away at work. His family and neighbours said he worked for Poly Medicure as manager.
At the Chittaranjan Park address of Allegeny in south Delhi is an office of Faridabad-based accountancy firm VRSK & Associates. VRSK partner Vineet Gupta directed queries to one Arvind (Gupta could not recall his last name) who he claimed dealt with the firm on behalf of Allegeny. He turned out to be the same Arvind named by Faridabad’s Narender Mittal & Co — auditors of VCB Trading — as the company’s point person  Arvind’s number went ‘out of service’ soon after he promised to get back with details of the company.
VCB trading: Its Vasundhara Enclave address in Delhi till August 14, 2013 as per RoC records turned out to be the residence of one Sujit (he refused to share his last name), a marketing executive at Poly Medicure. He claimed he knew nothing about VCB Trading.

One FIR Uber cabbie filed: on Sept 28  he told cops four passengers stole hisphonesWritten by Shalini Narayan | New Delhi |

On September 28, barely two months before he was arrested for allegedly raping a 27-year-old woman passenger, Uber taxi driver Shiv Kumar Yadav went to a police station in West Delhi — but as a ‘victim’.
READ:  Wife caught between husband she knows, the ‘history- sheeter’
In an FIR registered with the Rajouri Garden police station, Yadav, who himself faces at least eight cases in his native Mainpuri district of Uttar Pradesh, stated that he was bringing two passengers from Gurgaon to Rajouri Garden when he met two men at Tagore Garden who too sat in his taxi. The passengers made him “sniff something” following which he fell unconscious, according to the FIR. He claimed he woke up to find he had been robbed off his two cellphones and Rs 1,500 cash.
READ:  Uber honcho attacked by taxi union leader
Curiously though, the complaint the 32-year-old registered prior to the registration of the FIR mentioned that two women had hired his taxi from Iffco Chowk, while the FIR mentions only “passengers”.
According to the complaint, then women had reportedly used his phone to call their ‘friend’ who they claimed was waiting at Mahipalpur. When he reached the Gurdwara at Raghubir Nagar, two men flagged him down and requested him to allow them a ride. Yadav claimed he refused and after a while he fell unconscious.

Following the FIR, the Delhi Police arrested two men. The men reportedly had committed a similar crime before. Two Micromax phones were recovered from them.
Sub-Inspector Gurcharan Gill, the investigating officer of the case, told The Indian Express, “The men were arrested after Yadav gave us some leads. They were both residents of Raghubir Nagar but I am unable to recall their names. It took two or three days to arrest them. Two Micromax phones were recovered from their possession.”
At the time the FIR was filed, Yadav was employed with Uber and was driving the same Swift Dzire car DL 1Y D 7910 which had allegedly been used in the commission of the rape last week. Sources said the Delhi Police were investigating the case along with the latest crime.
According to the FIR accessed by The Indian Express, Yadav stated: “Around 2 am on September 28, I was travelling to Rajouri Garden from Iffco Chowk where I had picked up two passengers. When I reached Tagore Garden’s meat market, two men, who appeared to be in the age group of 20 and 22 years, sat in the taxi and asked me to drive them a little further. We reached the Gurdwara at Raghubir Nagar when the two men made me smell something following which I fell unconscious. When I woke up I found I had been robbed off my Apple and Micromax phones and Rs 1,500 continued…

St. Charles District 303 settles on 1.5 percent tax levy increaseSt. Charles District 303 settles on 1.5 percent tax levy increase
By Alexa Aguilar Chicago Tribune
Chicago Suburbs
St. Charles District 303 School Board decided it would tax homeowners an additional 1.5 percent for 2014
The St. Charles District 303 School Board decided Monday night that it would tax homeowners an additional 1.5 percent for 2014.
8
The district is asking for a 3.18 percent increase in the tax levy, what is allowed by law, but once new growth in District 303 is added in, and the district "abates" money to taxpayers, the overall increase will be about 1.5 percent, according to district officials.

That increase for the owner of a $300,000 home adds about $88 a year to their property tax bill, said Seth Chapman, assistant superintendent of human services.
Much of a lengthy discussion centered on whether the administration should be tightening its belt to bring that increase down to 1 percent.
Asking taxpayers for a 1.5 percent increase translates to cuts for the district of about $1.3 million for this school year, and another $1.9 million for the 2015-16 school year, Chapman said. The money generated by the levy covers the last half of this school year and the first half of the next.

About this site
Each year, the Illinois State Board of Education releases "report cards," detailed analyses of the performance of public schools and school districts in Illinois, in accordance with state and federal law. The reports are available on a state-funded web site and also as raw data . Except where otherwise noted, data on this site is derived from the raw 2014 report card data.
Scoring and other changes
In 2013, the Illinois State Board of Education added more difficult questions and increased scores required to pass reading and math ISATs, in keeping with the push for higher standards laid out in the Common Core State Standards Initiative. As a result, a school's 2013 ISAT composite scores may appear to have dropped considerably even in cases where student achievement has not changed. In 2014, the state included even more difficult questions on the reading and math tests, to prepare students for tougher exams in 2015.
ISBE plans to abandon the ISAT and the 11th grade PSAE exam in favor of the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) assessments in the 2014-2015 school year. The ACT test given as part of the 11th grade exams will be voluntary in 2015, rather than a mandatory state test.
ISAT and PSAE reporting
The Illinois State Board of Education began excluding science from ISAT and PSAE composite scores in 2013. ISAT and PSAE composites reflect reading and math only.
Beyond test scores
The 2014 Illinois Report Card is more expansive than ever, adding in new data about everything from the percent of graduates headed to college to how 9th graders fare in their first year of high school, and how long teachers and principals stay at the same school. Test scores are still part of the mix. The state’s website is: http://www.illinoisreportcard.com/
PARCC field testing and ISAT scores.
In the 2013-2014 school year, many schools participated in field testing the new PARCC exams coming on line in 2015. Some schools received waivers from participating in certain areas of the ISAT, because of the extent of field testing. That is why there are no ISAT results for particular schools.

Dr. Phil s startup launches video visits with therapistsDr. Phil's startup launches video visits with therapists
By Christina Farr Reuters
Apple Inc.
Doctor On Demand, founded by Dr. Phil, offers video visits with therapists.
Doctor On Demand is the latest Silicon Valley startup to bet that people will turn to mobile devices for confidential counseling. 
The company has launched a web and mobile service to connect people with its network of U.S. psychologists. The Doctor On Demand app is available on mobile devices with both Google Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS platforms. 
0
Doctor On Demand was founded by daytime talk show personality Dr. Phillip McGraw, popularly known as Dr. Phil, as well as his son Jay McGraw and entrepreneur Adam Jackson. It has raised $24 million from such venture firms as Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures, as well as angel investors including Virgin Group [VIRGI.UL] founder Richard Branson. 
The benefits of these virtual services outweigh any potential drawbacks, such as therapists missing important nonverbal cues, Phillip McGraw said. 
"Facial expression, body language and reactions to different questions or subject matters are all available for an attentive virtual therapist," he said. 
The company claims over 300 mental health professionals are ready to accept new patients on its service.
Patients answer a few background questions and then schedule an appointment for a live video chat with a therapist. 
Doctor On Demand charges $50 for a 25-minute session and $95 for 50 minutes. The mental health professionals receive the bulk of this fee, but Doctor On Demand makes money by retaining a cut.
Internet-based programs to support mental health have increasingly gained support from Silicon Valley's entrepreneurs and investors. Doctor on Demand rival MDLive recently acquired a startup called Breakthrough to move into the space.
Online therapy solutions are often more affordable and convenient than in-person alternatives, the company said. 
The majority of Doctor On Demand's therapists specialize in a brand of coaching called cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT, which helps people identify specific problems and gives them tools to overcome them. This type of therapy can be seamlessly adapted for video consultations, said Jackson, the company's CEO.
The company on Wednesday has also secured a partnership with UpSpring, a startup that specializes in providing tools for moms. Doctor On Demand's users can now request a private video conference with lactation consultants to address any concerns about breastfeeding. 
In the coming months, the company is aiming to provide more reimbursement options for its patients. Jackson said it is in talks with insurance providers and large employers, but declined to provide specifics.

Nobel laureates Malala  Satyarthi inspire people across the globe: World BankBachpan Bachao Andolan
(The World Bank chief said:…)
WASHINGTON: World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim today said the joint winners of Nobel Peace Prize awards, Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi, have inspired people across the world with their courageous efforts.
"Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi have inspired the world with their their courageous efforts on behalf of children everywhere --- for their fundamental right to be educated, to live free of fear and exploitation, to fulfill their unique potential," said Jim.
Malala's bravery in raising her voice and standing up to the brutal extremism in her own country Pakistan has given new hope to girls everywhere, he said.
Jim said Satyarthi's 'Bachpan Bachao Andolan' -- the Save Childhood Movement --- has peacefully shone a spotlight on the unconscionable exploitation of countless children, rescuing them from slavery and restoring them to childhood.
"Both follow in the tradition of Nobel Peace laureates before them, championing the most fundamental rights of all human beings, including and especially the youngest and most vulnerable among us," he said.
"They have led us by example, fulfilling the vision of Mahatma Gandhi and the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr , who said that 'peace is not a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal.'"
The World Bank chief said: "We applaud the Nobel Committee for honouring these two extraordinary individuals and their peaceful efforts to create a better world."

ComEd hikes electric delivery rates
ComEd: Higher electricity bills coming in January
Commonwealth Edison got the go-ahead Wednesday to raise delivery rates by 11 percent to help pay for a $2.6 billion grid modernization effort.
8
The $245 million  increase in electric delivery costs will be reflected in January electric bills.
ComEd this year added about $5.50 per month to the average customer bill to pay for grid modernization. The increase approved Wednesday will add $2 to $3 on top of the earlier increase to the average monthly bill.
Commonwealth Edison and Ameren Illinois can avoid legislative oversight until 2019 and continue to spend ratepayer money on building a digital "smart grid" as a result of Illinois Senate action Thursday. ( Julie Wernau )
Customers in ComEd's service area pay the increase in rates regardless of which company supplies their electricity. That's because the money will be used to pay for the grid project, not the electricity itself.
David Kolata, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, said the consumer watchdog organization was "disappointed'' with the increase "especially as (it) will hit consumers in the heart of what could be another expensive winter."
Kolata also was critical of the state's new way of setting electric rates by formula because it limits the ability of consumer advocates and regulators to push for reductions of proposed rate hikes.
@frost Gas is cheap only because the West wants to put a hurt on Putin & Russia, and it's working to a degree.
NE_169
18
The rate hikes, determined by a formula, went into effect in 2011 under legislation that allowed ComEd to proceed with the smart grid project. The utility had argued  it couldn't justify investing $2.6 billion in the project unless it could guarantee the money it invested could be recouped quickly and predictably through utility rate hikes.
This month the General Assembly voted to approve a measure that would extend by two years the date by which utilities must inform the legislature of their progress on the program.
For ComEd, the extension means it won't have to check in with legislators until after nearly all the money has been spent and that during that time yearly rate hikes will continue to be determined by formula over a nine-month process.
ComEd originally proposed an increase of $275 million. The Illinois Commerce Commission made adjustments to the company's annual incentive program to arrive at a lower number.
ComEd filed its initial rate formula petition in November 2011 and has adjusted rates in 2012, 2013 and 2014 using the formula.

Cabinet to take up Electricity Act amendment proposalCabinet to take up Electricity Act amendment proposal
As exonerations continue  so do executionsIn Buffalo, another likely exoneration :
Josue Ortiz is on the cusp of freedom.
District Attorney Frank A. Sedita, one of the few remaining obstacles to Ortiz’s release from prison, is dropping his opposition, paving the way for Ortiz to be freed, possibly as early as this week.
Ortiz, a West Side man now in Attica Correctional Facility, is believed to have been wrongfully convicted in Erie County Court of the double murder that sent him to jail 10 years ago.
“Simply stated, I cannot, in good conscience, permit a man to remain in jail when I have a reasonable doubt concerning his guilt,” Sedita said in a letter Monday.
The letter to Erie County Judge Thomas P. Franczyk is expected to accelerate the process for Ortiz’s release.
Sedita pointed to a number of reasons why he is dropping his opposition to Ortiz’s release, most notably an alleged confession to the murders by Efrain “Cheko” Hidalgo.
And in Ohio, another one :
A judge Tuesday cleared Ronnie Bridgeman of a murder that he didn’t commit. The false allegation, however, cost him 28 years in prison.
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Pamela Barker tossed out the 1975 conviction against the 57-year-old man who now goes by the name Kwame Ajamu. He was released from prison in 2003. Barker’s decision comes just weeks after judges  threw out the cases against his brother, Wiley, and Ricky Jackson.
“My battle has come to an end,” he told Barker.
Then, he detailed what 28 years behind bars did to him.
“We were robbed,” Ajamu said. “There will be no offspring when I die. When my brother passes away, that is it. We don’t have children. There will never be another Ronnie Bridgeman. The important part is that we have been united while we are standing forward and upward and that we are not looking at each other in the graveyard.”
Meanwhile, an Illinois appeals court reversed two murder convictions in two days this week. You might think that the ongoing stream of exonerations, findings of police and prosecutor misconduct, and overturned convictions might cause some public officials to think twice about irreversible executions. That’s true in some places. But not in Georgia.
Robert Wayne Holsey died by lethal injection Tuesday night for the killing of a Baldwin County deputy in 1995.
He was executed at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison near Jackson.
In his last moments, Holsey addressed the father of Deputy Will Robinson, who witnessed the execution. Holsey said: “Mr. Robinson, I’m sorry for taking your son’s life that night. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me and my family.” That account comes from our reporter Randall Savage, who was among a handful of reporters who were also witnesses.
There was no doubt about Holsey’s guilt, although he was represented by an attorney who had a quart-a-day vodka habit, including during the trial, and was later disbarred for stealing from his clients.
Last year, I wrote about the state of the death penalty in Florida. That state leads the country in death row exonerations. That fact only motivated the state legislature to speed up executions. I guess that’s one way to cut down on exonerations — just kill them before they can prove their innocence. Missouri has also seen a spate of exonerations, including several overturned convictions won by Kenny Hulshof , a former prosecutor (and congressman) often specifically used by the state’s attorneys general because of his reputation for winning death verdicts. But Missouri isn’t going to let a few close calls keep business away from the death chamber.
Early Wednesday morning, Missouri set a record for its number of executions in a year.
Paul Goodwin was the 10th man executed, more than any other year since the death penalty was reinstated in the state.
Goodwin was put to death for sexually assaulting Joan Crotts, a 63-year old widow, and then killing her with a hammer.
In denying clemency, Gov. Jay Nixon referred to the crime as “brutal” and “senseless.”
You might say the same thing about executing a man who is mentally deficient.
Goodwin’s attorneys had argued that their client wasn’t fit to be executed due to his mental deficits, legally referred to as mental retardation or an intellectual disability.
The most recent assessment by a psychologist found Goodwin was “borderline-intellectually disabled” with an IQ of 73. Another assessment found Goodwin had the mental understanding of a 13 year old.
“The one absolute certainty for this examiner over the 12 years I have been involved with this case is that Paul Terrence Goodwin is now, and probably always has been, mentally retarded,” Denis Keyes wrote in concluding his examination.
“As such, if the state of Missouri proceeds with his judicial execution, then it is the devout opinion of this expert of 40 years experience in mental retardation, the state is doing so against the findings of both state and federal law, the Supreme Court and the Constitution of the United States of America,” Keyes wrote.
The good news is that just a small percentage of counties  sentence and carry out the vast majority of death penalty cases in America. The bad news is that those counties are incredibly proficient. And there seems to be a strong correlation between those counties and the types of police and prosecutor misconduct that lead to wrongful convictions.

CIA torture report
(The book will be around 500…)
NEW YORK: A bound edition of the CIA torture report will be in stores by the end of the month.
Melville House announced Wednesday that it was publishing the Senate Intelligence Committee's "Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program," which accused the CIA of inflicting suffering on detainees beyond its legal limits and peddling unsubstantiated stories that harsh interrogations saved American lives.
The book will be around 500 pages, representing the executive summary and conclusions of a still-classified 6,700-page full investigation, and is scheduled for Dec. 30. The report is not subject to traditional copyright laws and may be issued by other publishers, too.
Several government releases have become best-sellers even though they can be read for free, including the probe of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the "9/11 Commission Report," a National Book Award finalist in 2004 for an edition published by W.W. Norton and Company.
Melville House publicity director Julia Fleischaker said the torture report would not include a foreword or any other commentary.
"We feel that it stands on its own as a historical document," she said.

Despite crash  oil traders buy $100 options | Oil hits $60Mobius Risk Group
(Some argue that it is an opportune…)
NEW YORK: Oil traders have been quietly buying cheap, far out-of-the-money call options at $100 a barrel, betting that the biggest sell-off since the financial crisis has gone too far and that crude is likely to rebound by this time next year.
Open interest in US crude oil $100 calls for December 2015 has jumped 13 per cent in the last two weeks to nearly 37,000 on Wednesday, with a premium of around 40 cents.
For the December 2016 $100 calls, open interest has surged by more than 50 per cent to nearly 16,000, with a premium of around $1.00, according to exchange data.
With US crude oil futures for January hovering at just above $60 a barrel, down from nearly $108 a barrel in June, traders aren't likely counting on those options to expire in the money but rather betting that their value will increase provided oil prices bottom out or begin to creep up next year.
"People don't trade options because they think the price will necessarily get there. They're looking for relatively good value," said John Saucer, vice president of research and analytics at Mobius Risk Group in Houston.
"The question is: How do you get the most bang for your buck?" he said.
Since the summer, oversupplied global markets coupled with lackluster demand kicked off a sell-off in both the US crude and Brent contracts. The sell-off accelerated following the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) meeting in Vienna last month, when member countries decided not to cut production amid speculation of a price war.
The motivations for investors to have so many open contracts in those two months at $100 are not immediately clear. High levels of activity in December are not a surprise as it is among the most liquid months of the year for hedging.
Yet, some argue that it is an opportune moment to buy as falling prices have increased the put skew - the difference in implied volatility for out-of-the-money and in-the-money options - allowing more upside potential to the call side.
"There are too many guys on the short side now," said one trader.

Good Samaritans come to aid of children with liver ailmentUpdated: December 11, 2014 04:26 IST
Good Samaritans come to aid of children with liver ailment
Afshan Yasmeen
Ismail Khan is among the children who underwent liver transplant in BGS Global Hospitals with donation from philanthropists
Help poured in from unexpected quarters for these three children
Three underprivileged children suffering from congenital liver ailments, who required transplantation, have got a new lease of life thanks to the generosity of Good Samaritans in the city.
In the absence of any insurance coverage even under Vajpayee Arogyashree (the State government’s health insurance scheme for BPL families) these children would have joined the list of thousands of poor people deprived of quality health care but for this timely help.
In the absence of any government hospital in the State offering liver transplant as yet, most patients, especially paediatric cases, succumb to the disease.
Recovering
Help poured in from unexpected quarters for the children who landed in BGS Global Hospitals for treatment in the last one year. All the three have undergone transplants and are recovering.
For Ashwini, whose father works in a foundry in Kumbalgodu, the factory owner and his colleagues pooled in money to not just to fund the surgery but also provide post-operative treatment and care. Although a chunk of the surgery cost was recovered through Employees’ State Insurance (ESI), her father’s colleagues are now bearing the post-operative recurring costs.
To ensure that Ashwini does not catch infections, the family has moved from their joint family accommodation in Byatarayanpura to a small house in Kumbalgodu. The house rent and monthly maintenance of the family is being taken care by the factory owner, D. Harikrishna, and other colleagues.
Similarly, Shreyas, whose father works in a medical equipment manufacturing firm in Whitefield, got help from his colleagues. Nearly Rs. 9 lakh of the total surgery cost of Rs. 15 lakh was pooled in by the colleagues.
In the case of Ismail Khan, whose father runs a tea shop in Goripalya, his family had to initially struggle for funds. However, following the hospital’s intervention, several individuals and companies from the city donated money for the surgery.
Sonal Asthana, consultant multi-organ transplant surgeon at BGS Global Hospitals, who conducted the surgeries, said although kidney and heart surgeries were covered under government health insurance schemes, liver transplant, which is quite expensive, had been left out. “If treated early, children usually do extremely well post-surgery,” the doctor said.
Seeking insurance coverage
A group of individuals and doctors, who are campaigning for affordable liver transplant initiative, are now lobbying with the government to provide insurance coverage for liver transplants in children.

Harvard Business School professor apologizes for e-mail rant over a $4 overchargeBy Elahe Izadi December 10, 2014 Follow @ElaheIzadi
Harvard, in all its glory. (Lisa Poole/AP)
You’ve already heard about the Harvard Business School professor’s angry e-mails to a Chinese restaurant manager because of a $4 overcharge, right?
Sure you have !
The e-mail exchange got loads of attention after getting published by Boston.com  on Tuesday.
In his e-mails to Ran Duan of the Sichuan Garden and the Baldwin Bar, Ben Edelman, an associate professor at the elite business school , demanded a $12 refund, citing the “Massachusetts consumer protection statute, MGL93a, wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations.” It is, Edelman wrote, “a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price.” He noted that he had referred the matter “to applicable authorities.”
After having seen the matter referred to the court of public opinion, where he has not fared particularly well, Edelman now says he’s sorry for the hubbub.
In an apology   posted Wednesday afternoon on his Web site , Edelman wrote: “Having reflected on my interaction with Ran, including what I said and how I said it, it’s clear that I was very much out of line. I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation. Clearly I failed to do so. I am sorry, and I intend to do better in the future.”
Edelman, who is an attorney in addition to a professor, said that he’s reached out to Duan and plans to personally apologize to him.
Duan manages the bar inside Sichuan Garden’s Woburn location, a restaurant his parents opened in Brookline in the 1990s, according to Boston.com. In his e-mails to Edelman, Duan apologized for the outdated prices on the restaurant’s Web site.
Things got out of hand after that, with requests for refunds and arguments over the disclaimer on the restaurant Web site.
It seemed … a bit much.
“I personally respond to every complaint and try to handle every situation personally,” Duan told Boston.com. “I have worked so hard to make my family proud and to elevate our business.”
The e-mail exchange with Edelman “just broke my heart,” he said.
After the Boston.com story was published, embarrassed Harvard Business School students set up a fundraising page for the Greater Boston Food Bank , noting that “negative stereotypes of Harvard and HBS were reinforced” by Edelman’s e-mails.
The professor’s apology came a day after he wrote to the Boston Globe  that he had reached out to town officials, who responded that “they wouldn’t be able to help.”
“I wonder how many consumers were overcharged before I flagged the issue and pressed the restaurant to remove the false statements on its Web site,” Edelman wrote to the Globe.
I wonder how many Harvard professors will cite state statutes when reviewing Chinese takeout orders. After this episode, probably none.

Smith and Clarke punish toothless India
1st Test, Day 2 — Steve Smith hits career-best 162*. Michael Clarke defies back injury to score a famous hundred on a rain-hit day in Adelaide.
By Abhishek Purohit | ESPNcricinfo –  Wed 10 Dec, 2014 1:03 PM IST
Scores | Images
Michael Clarke battled through severe back pain to make his 28th Test hundred, Steven Smith scored his fifth and the pair punished India's inconsistent bowlers on a second day badly hit by rain. The pair racked up 163 for the sixth wicket through three long interruptions in play, hitting 21 fours in the 30 overs they batted together. Poor light ended play four deliveries after Clarke fell for 128.
Clarke, who had taken injections after retiring on 60 in the 44th over on day one, accompanied Smith out under gloomy skies in a start delayed by ten minutes. He winced as he pulled and hobbled more than he ran initially. Unable to lean fully forward, he stood on the crease and hit the fast bowlers. He used his feet to spin, dragging himself to the other end if a run was available, or lurching back to the crease if it wasn't. His mobility improved gradually, but even late in the day, he was gingerly taking the twos.
India were unable to test even a half-fit Clarke. Their fast bowlers had been too full and wide at the start of the match. This morning, they pulled their lengths back too much. Ishant Sharma , their best bowler on day one, started short and wide to be put way for four by Smith. Mohammed Shami did the same first ball of the next over, and Clarke helped himself this time.
Both batsmen brought up emotional hundreds. Clarke celebrated quietly with an intensely expressive face after coming through a bouncer burst from round the stumps on 98. Smith walked up to where 408, Phillip Hughes ' Test cap number, had been painted on the ground and stood there to look up at the sky.
Smith then set about the Indian bowling with even more purpose and aggression, powering boundaries in limited-overs fashion. India had conceded 51 in the 12.2 overs leading into the first interruption. Between the second and the third, they leaked 50 in 7.3. Varun Aaron went for nearly six runs an over, Shami five, and the debutant legspinner Karn Sharma tallied over four. The lowest any of them conceded was 120.
Smith was in so much control he did pretty much whatever he wanted to. He slogged Aaron just past the bowler's head for four, he made room and drilled Shami through the covers, he reverse-swept Karn from outside leg stump.
He did offer a simple stumping chance when he missed a charge at Karn, but Wriddhiman Saha , having kept for 109 overs, could not collect. Smith was reprieved again off Karn, on 161, when Ishant put down a diving chance at long leg. Clarke swept the next ball straight to square leg, and Mitchell Johnson walked in. The only plus for India was that he had a bat in hand, and not the new ball.

Businesses Must Take a Stand Against Gender-Based Violencereddit
This week marks both International Human Rights Day and the end of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence . If we are to have real gender equality and a more just society, we must ensure that women participate in the economy on a full and equal basis. Throughout the world, however, women face obstacles to employment and barriers to opportunities for advancement because of gender-based violence in their homes, communities and workplaces.
Every day I talk with working women trying to make ends meet and build a strong future for their families. It's hard work as it is, piecing together an income and meeting responsibilities at home. But when you add intimate-partner violence or sexual harassment on the job, the day-to-day challenges become almost impossible hardships, impacting job tenure, creating intense emotional stress and, of course, taking a toll on women's health.
Worldwide, between 40 percent and 50 percent of women report experiencing unwanted physical contact, sexual advances, or other forms of harassment and abuse at work. This abuse often goes unreported because many women fear that speaking out will jeopardize their livelihood. Intimate-partner violence also has profoundly negative effects on the workplace . It impacts individuals' ability to perform job duties, and some survivors report being asked to leave their jobs for reasons connected to the abuse.
Gender-based violence cuts across worksites, sectors, countries and continents. For example, in Kenya, a staggering 90 percent of workers in export-processing zones report they have experienced or observed sexual abuse within their workplace, and many noted the connection between professional advancement and sexual relations with a supervisor. The vast majority of the women who were subjected to abuse-95%-were afraid to report the problem and risk losing their jobs. In Tunisia, a recent study of domestic workers found that just over 18 percent had been forced into sexual intercourse, and an additional 14 percent were victims of sexual abuse.
Here in the United States, a survey of women in Iowa meatpacking plants found that 41 percent experienced unwanted touching in the workplace. More than 25 percent of the women interviewed reported they had been threatened with firing or harder work if they did not respond to aggressors' advances.
Gender-based violence exacerbates inequalities and power dynamics in the workplace and in society. In industries in which the majority of the workforce is female, women are critical to business success, but violence and sexual harassment often prevent them from occupying positions of power and receiving recognition for their contributions. Statistically, men hold more supervisory and higher-prestige jobs , while women are concentrated in jobs with lower pay, lower prestige and less decision-making power.
Women are often concentrated in positions that carry a higher risk of violence, including domestic workers, teachers, shop and bank clerks, social workers, and health care professionals. Further, as the International Labor Organization recently wrote , "women are overrepresented among workers holding atypical and precarious jobs, [and] thus often lack both individual and collective bargaining power."
Gender-based violence is a global pandemic-one that must be met with a global response. Currently, there is a proposal before the Governing Body of the ILO to develop an international standard to combat gender-based violence in the workplace. Building an international standard at the ILO is an important opportunity for governments, workers and employers to come together to seek solutions, guidance and best practices to develop effective laws and policies.
The ILO is made up of three groups: governments, workers and employers, who must reach a consensus decision on which issues will become standards. Currently, the standard on gender-based violence has support from workers and many governments, including the United States. However, despite many global companies adopting policies that promote gender equality and female advancement, the business group has consistently opposed the measure when it comes up for a vote. We know that ending violence in the workplace is not only the right thing for female workers but makes good business sense.
We need more than just lip service to women's rights. We need tangible, concrete measures designed to address gender-based violence in the workplace. Many businesses have already embraced addressing this issue in their own policies, so there are real opportunities for government, workers and companies to come together to advance the dialogue on women's rights and workplace fairness. Ensuring that women have access to jobs with decent pay and safe working conditions is critical to building a more just and equal society.

Greenpeace apologizes for stunt at ancient Peru site

Greenpeace
(Greenpeace said it was "deeply…)
LIMA: Environmental group Greenpeace apologized Wednesday after Peru accused it of damaging a millenia-old archaeological site when its activists displayed a protest banner there calling for action on climate change.
The stunt at the ancient Nazca lines, enormous drawings etched in the earth some 2,000 years ago by a pre-Inca civilization, drew a furious reaction from Peru, which is currently hosting UN talks aimed at curbing global warming.
Greenpeace set up large letters beside one of the designs, known as the Hummingbird , reading: "Time for change! The future is renewable. Greenpeace."
Describing the action as an "attack," the Peruvian culture ministry vowed to crack down on those responsible.
"After the illegal, premeditated action by environmental defense group Greenpeace, the zone has been seriously affected," the ministry said in a statement Tuesday.
It called on Peruvians to "collaborate in identifying the people who carried out this attack on the cultural heritage of all Peruvians and all humanity" and said those responsible must be "stopped from leaving the country."
Greenpeace said it was "deeply concerned about any offense" it may have caused and said its activism was always waged with respect for "the peoples of the world and their cultural heritage."
The lines were listed as a Unesco world heritage site in 1994. Created between 500 BC and AD 500 by the Nazca people, they have long intrigued archaeologists with the mystery of their size, their meticulously drawn figures and their abundance.
Some of the drawings depict living creatures, others stylized plants or fantastical beings, others geometric figures that stretch for kilometers (miles).
The site is best seen from the sky, its lines criss-crossing the Peruvian desert over more than 500 square kilometers (200 square miles).
Greenpeace said on its Facebook page that the letters it used were simply cloth spread across the ground, and that its activists had taken care to cause "absolutely no damage" to the site.
But Peruvian authorities said even entering the area was "strictly prohibited because of the fragility of the terrain around the lines."
They say a group of 12 to 15 people wearing boots and sneakers entered the area, where access is only allowed in special foam-covered foot equipment.

Mobile marketing grips e-comm: Flipkart gives Google s Gosf a miss for its own app saleOnline retailers like Flipkart, Snapdeal turn marketing focus to mobiles

(Indian e-commerce companies…)
BENGALURU: Flipkart is giving the Google-run Great Online Shopping Festival a miss this year because the biggest Indian online retailer is promoting its own mobile app. Snapdeal is participating, but pushing its mobile app as well.
Indian e-commerce companies are changing their customer-acquisition strategy and are enticing people with offers to install their apps on mobile phones. They expect the move to create more loyal customers than those who land on the portal through online searches.
For search giant Google, this growing trend underlines the need to expand mobile offerings to retain its healthy rate of growth in a market where more people are expected to access the Internet on the mobile than on desktop.
"The ecommerce industry is now mcommerce in India; the way you reach out to customers is very different even from a year ago when other digital channels were more prominent," said Mausam Bhatt, senior director for mobile commerce & digital marketing at Flipkart. Flipkart and the local operations of US ecommerce giant Amazon get more than half their India traffic through mobile phones. And, these companies are increasingly spending on mobile-related promotions.
Bhatt declined to provide details on Flipkart's marketing expenditure. Traditionally, its spending has mostly been on search engine and display advertising, but he said there has been a large shift in spending to expand the number of customers having its mobile app installed on their phones.
"An app install is an endorsement that someone wants to shop with you," said Kishore Thota, head of digital marketing at Amazon India. While Thota still counts search and display advertising as an important part of Amazon's marketing strategy, he says from a long term point of view, "We definitely see more investment going into app presence."
This shift means Google may have to work harder for the advertising dollar. For Google, which posted more than Rs 3,000 crore in India revenue for FY14, ecommerce has contributed to the 47 per cent growth in revenue over the previous year. For many years, search engine marketing, or advertising on search queries, has been the mainstay of online businesses. The other major form of advertising online was display advertising. Google is the leader in both.
As more and more consumers move to mobile, both forms of traditional advertising have been slowing. The first by the proliferation of apps and the second by the smaller screen sizes that make it tough for display advertising. "You have to really earn the real estate on mobile," said Thota.
One-time purchases, like buying insurance or car will still be influenced by a Google search while regular actions like recharging a mobile, ordering a cab or ordering food, will see app install and more loyalty, said Naman Sarawagi, founder and chief executive of comparison shopping site FindYogi.
Google, though, has a few things going for it. "There is a shift in revenue from SEM (search engine marketing) as we know it, but with products like Google Maps and Google Now, Google still has significant stake in the future of interaction, thereby safeguarding its search and discovery based revenue," said Sarawagi.
 
Google's mobile revenue is already supporting its growth globally. In the US, market research firm eMarketer estimates that search revenue from desktop computers will decline to $10 billion this year from $10.8 billion in 2013. But mobile search revenue is expected to grow to $5.1 billion from $3.1 billion. According to the estimate, Google's total advertising revenue will increase 14 per cent to $43.5 billion in 2014.
"The shift to mobile is one we welcome and in Asia the change is happening faster than anywhere else in the world," said Praveen Sharma, director-performance at Google-APAC. Sharma said Google has driven hundreds of millions of app downloads through these formats.
The trend isn't limited to India or Asia. According to eMarketer, desktop search in the US will decline significantly this year, as mobile search ad spending grows.
In India, mobile advertising has steadily grown in proportion of the total digital market, to 14 per cent in the fiscal year through March 2014 from 7 per cent in fiscal 2012, according to the Internet and Mobile Association of India's latest report.
In the same period, contribution of search to total advertising revenue has gone down to 30 per cent from 34 per cent. Display advertising has also gone down in proportion as social media and video advertising have grown. The total digital advertising market is expected to reach Rs 3,575 crore in fiscal 2015 from Rs 2,750 crore last year.
To serve its growing mobile clientele, the search giant has also launched advertising solutions for the mobile world. This year, Google launched app promotions advertising formats across its products including search, display network and YouTube.

French Hostage Held By Al Qaeda For 3 Years Is ReleasedSerge Lazarevic, French Hostage Held By Al Qaeda In Africa, Is Released

PARIS (AP) — France's last hostage was freed Tuesday after being held for more than three years by al-Qaida's North Africa branch — rekindling debate over whether countries should negotiate with extremists or stick to a muscular, uncompromising policy that runs the risk of a beheading or a botched rescue attempt.
French President Francois Hollande announced the "happy news" that 51-year-old Serge Lazarevic had been freed from captivity in Mali, prompting a standing ovation in the National Assembly.
"We no longer have any hostages in any country of the world, and we should not have any," Hollande said.
TV images hours later showed a smiling Lazarevic — bald, goateed and 40 pounds (20 kilograms) lighter — as he met with Niger's president. He was to fly to France early Wednesday.
The release stood in sharp contrast to the failed rescue in Yemen last weekend that ended in the deaths of an American journalist and a South African aid worker held by al-Qaida's branch in the Arabian Peninsula.
The announcement immediately raised questions over what concessions the French government made to the extremist group holding Lazarevic, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). France insists it pays no ransoms and does not exchange prisoners, although in September Hollande acknowledged that "other countries have done so, to help us."
But as with numerous French hostage releases in recent years, the story of Lazarevic's release was far from complete. Hollande credited cooperation of the governments of Mali and Niger, but gave no details.
Analysts, lawmakers and critics quickly took to the French airwaves to discuss the pros and cons of paying ransoms and speculate whether the French government, its friends or affiliates did.
Worryingly for some, Lazarevic may have been freed in a trade.
His liberation came days after the release of two al-Qaida fighters imprisoned in Mali for his kidnapping and that of a colleague, Philippe Verdon, according to a security official in Mali. Verdon was later found shot to death in July 2013.
The two al-Qaida detainees were transferred to mediators in Niger on Saturday and turned over to al-Qaida, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety.
A French official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the issue is sensitive declined to give any details on the release of the al-Qaida prisoners beyond saying the negotiations to secure Lazarevic's freedom were led by Mali and Niger.
Lazarevic and Verdon were kidnapped from their hotel in northeastern Mali in November 2011 while doing a feasibility study for a cement factory, their families have said. Speculation is widespread, however, that there were other reasons for their presence in Mali, a long-time desert hideout for al-Qaida and other extremists in Africa's Sahel region.
AQIM alleged that they were French spies, but a Western counterterrorism official denied the claim.
Hostage-taking is a lucrative business in Mali and other Sahel countries. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb took numerous Western hostages until France intervened in Mali in January 2013 to rout out extremists. U.S. officials have quietly accused France and other European countries of paying ransoms for their kidnapped citizens.
President Barack Obama last month ordered a review of how the United States responds when its citizens are taken hostage overseas, following the beheadings of Americans by Islamic militants in recent months. But the U.S. administration said the review will not include changing the policy against ransoms.
"You have a choice between the policy of Mr. Obama, which appears to be not to negotiate and to see hostages killed, and a position of negotiating without admitting it," Alain Marsaud, a conservative French lawmaker, told the BFM television network.
"It's true that we negotiate, we pay, and we try to get results .... There isn't a single Frenchman who believes Mr. Lazarevic was freed because Mr. Hollande has nice eyes."
Hollande on Tuesday urged French citizens and companies to take continued precautions against kidnappings. At one point, at least 14 French nationals were held hostage by Islamic militants in West Africa.
His tone was tempered by confirmation of "the darkest news" about another French hostage: Gilberto Rodriguez-Leal, who was captured in 2012 while traveling in Mauritania and Mali. Authorities have for months feared he was dead.
Pierre Martinet, a former official for France's spy agency DGSE, said French citizens will continue to be targeted by extremist kidnappers "because they know it's among the governments that directly negotiate for their liberation."
"It's part of geopolitics," Martinet said on French TV. "I know very well that we have given money; I know people myself who have given money. It happens. We have to stop lying to ourselves."
Pascal Lupart, ex-president of a support committee for the two French hostages, said he was particularly concerned that Lazarevic may have been freed only after two of his kidnappers were freed.
Extremists know that seizing French hostages is "financial manna," Lupart said. "You're not going to tell me that he was freed because of political pressure."
On French TV, Africa expert Antoine Glaser noted that France often leans hard on African leaders to help win the freedom of French hostages.
Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou acknowledged as much after welcoming Lazarevic on Tuesday. Hollande, he said, took him aside at an Africa security conference in Paris last December and asked him to "keep up the work" on Lazarevic's case after four French hostages seized in Niger were released last year.

(The Centre should provide…)

The new government has unfurled plans to build 100 gw of solar power by 2022. Here are a few suggestions to execute this grand vision:
First, it's time the general perception that solar energy is expensive is removed. India gets 70% more solar radiation than European countries. This means the same solar panels yield 70% more power in India. In addition, peak demand in India coincides for 70-80% of the time during which solar energy is harnessed. This peak demand is mostly met by diesel, which costs almost double that of solar electricity, currently at Rs 6-7 per kWh.
So, when we commission a solar plant, it will displace diesel for 70-80% of its generation and imported coal for the rest. At all times, solar is substituting for imported energy, which is far more expensive.
Second, adequate capital should be raised without crowding out investments in other sectors. The proposed 100 gw capacity requires about $125 billion, of which $90 billion will be debt financing. The global financial crisis has created a great opportunity for availing cheaper credit from global markets. As per International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates, green energy will receive almost 60% of the $5 trillion expected to be invested in new power plants over the next decade. Solar's requirement is less than 2% of this amount.
The Holy Grail of successful financing is effective allocation of risks between different stakeholders — in this case the consumer, the investor, central/state governments and the developer. The development cost and schedule risk are best borne by technically competent solar power developers once a power purchase agreement (PPA) is signed with a state electricity board (SEB). The developer is in the best situation to procure land, negotiate for panel prices with investors and execute the project expeditiously.
  Fortunately, solar power requires far fewer clearances than for coal and doesn't require contiguous land. The government should put a 25 mw per bid floor to ensure technical and financial competence of the bidder.
A big part of solar energy costs is the cost of debt, since fuel costs are zero and operational costs are minimal. Any action by government to reduce interest cost will reduce the cost of solar energy and accelerate its adoption. A foreign lender will view depreciation of currency as a risk since the tariff is designated in rupees and will want to be compensated for that higher risk.
The government/RBI should mitigate that risk away from foreign lenders. This potentially has no cost to the government/RBI since implementation of solar energy will contribute to the appreciation of the rupee. This is because we estimate forex savings of more than $500 billion over a 25-year period from the commissioning of 100 gw solar power and substituting the use of diesel and imported coal.
The developer is incurring a major portion of costs in dollars, but is shielding the consumer from rupee depreciation risk by designating the tariff in rupees. Solar investments' dollar economic internal rate of return to the Indian economy is in the high teens while the borrowing of debt could be only at 5-6%. The economic surplus from each project is transferred to and aggregated in the larger Indian economy. Hence, the role of the RBI and government is perfectly justified and is crucial in achieving this grand vision.
If developers can avail of the debt in rupee at 5-6% — i.e. at the same interest as that of international dollar denominated debt, they can provide solar power at less than Rs 5/kWh, and that too with no escalation in future. They also don't strain the domestic banks and can raise all the debt abroad.
The government can easily raise about $15-20 billion per annum over the next five years from external sources including NRIs, multilateral agencies, development banks, sovereign wealth funds and lend directly to projects once the PPA is signed up. This will also accelerate development of solar projects since raising debt financing for individual projects can consume a lot of resources.
One must also ensure reliability of cashflows from solar projects. There are substantial credit risks which hound the power sector due to the deteriorating credit profile of the SEBs and the lax enforcement of the renewable purchase obligation (RPO) mechanism. The state government needs to backstop the PPAs with the SEBs and ensure strict compliance of the RPOs.
The Centre should provide a guarantee that if states/SEBs do not pay their solar developer in time, they will step up and take it out of allocation to the states. Only those states that sign up for this programme should be entitled to the foreign exchange risk covered by the central government/RBI and avail of cheap solar power.
The benefits of tapping into our own clean energy source are unmatchable from an energy security viewpoint, climate change mitigation, adoption of future-proof technology and developing quicker power sources, generation of employment accelerating our growth rate. There is little doubt that the government needs to ensure reliable and cost-effective energy supply to ensure making the 'Make in India' programme a resounding success. There are few initiatives so impactful and so easily doable for our country. Solar can be the shale equivalent of India.

Beijings southern movesWith the support of some South Asian states, it’s only a matter of time before.
Posted: December 10, 2014 12:05 am

It is fair to argue that South Asia had not been a priority for China’s foreign policy, although China has been an observer at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) since 2005 and a strategic ally of Pakistan. However, China’s interest in South Asia has increased considerably. Its fresh bid for full membership to Saarc reflects South Asia’s growing importance for Beijing’s foreign policy agenda.
Chinese President Xi Jinping paid state visits to Sri Lanka and the Maldives in September. Xi is the first Chinese head of state to visit the Maldives since the establishment of their diplomatic relationship in 1972. Maldives President Yameen Abdul Gayoom was quoted by Chinese media as saying: Other South Asian states were wondering how the Maldives could invite a Chinese president to visit the tiny country. Similarly, Xi’s state visit to Sri Lanka was the first by a Chinese president after 28 years. It has now clearly emerged that China is more interested in South Asia than ever.
China’s growing interest in South Asia has been driven by three main strategic considerations. First, with its rising power, China is expanding its influence beyond its immediate neighbourhood, including South Asia and the Indian Ocean. Despite India’s displeasure, a Chinese nuclear-powered submarine docked at the Colombo port. For the first time, Beijing did not keep the stopover confidential. Instead, it termed the episode as “nothing unusual”. That means China is trying to make its military presence in South Asia a “usual” affair. But, like many pundits argue, China has not been deemed a South Asian state. Therefore, its presence in this region has always raised eyebrows. The Saarc membership will serve as a solution since it will grant China a “South Asian” identity, with which Beijing can play an insider role in the region.
The second reason for Beijing to be more involved in South Asian affairs is related to China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative, the abbreviation for the “Silk Road Economic Belt” and the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road”. The “Silk Road Economic Belt” was first mentioned during Xi’s visit to Kazakhstan in September 2013, while the “Maritime Silk Road” was proposed when he visited Indonesia in October 2013. Since then, Beijing has tried to use the initiatives to establish a more integrated relationship with its neighbours by building transportation facilities.
The main purpose of Xi’s visit to South Asia in September, including India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, was to promote the grand strategy, also dubbed as “China’s Marshall Plan”. So far, China has won public backing from some Saarc members, such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. But China also needs a multilateral mechanism for accelerating efforts to construct the
“One Belt One Road” in South Asia. In addition to the recently launched continued…

The Narendra Modi government is only six months old but it is quite clear that a structural transformation of the Indian polity and economy is underway. Reform of labour laws was a favourite talking point for decades, if not a century, and remained just that. Now there is significant movement with one state, Rajasthan, actually obtaining a presidential go-ahead to diverge from onerous Central labour laws. The Independence Day speech marked a significant and desirable foray into the social areas of discrimination against the girl child and sanitation. Later, the cleanliness campaign was launched — again, a much-talked about subject earlier. Now, some long-awaited progress.
India’s image abroad has improved considerably. The image of the prime minister has improved manifestly at home. Modi is a person capable of taking hard decisions, and acting decisively in the national interest. All this is showing up in electoral results. Modi’s BJP is winning in regions not thought conceivable just a few months ago. All in all, remarkable progress since May 26, and enough evidence to convince anyone that more has been done in the last six months than in the last two decades.
Which is why the disappointments with the Modi government hurt. These regrettable disappointments have been in both the social and economic spheres. Perhaps the biggest setbacks have been due to the Hindutva (or is it RSS?) agenda being pursued rather vigorously in education and “culture”.
As regards Sanskrit, that the language should be an option in government schools is not being debated. That it should be a compulsory third language is a matter of concern and much debate. How can Modi, the moderniser and mindset changer, suggest and implement a policy for the mandatory learning of a dead language? If making the learning of Sanskrit compulsory is not going back to the dark ages, what is? Do we know of a single country where a parallel dead language, Latin, is compulsory?
Smriti Irani, education minister, reacted to the questioning of her policy of making Sanskrit compulsory in government schools by claiming that the media was distorting the facts. (What would governments do if they did not have the media to kick around?) She claimed, and this seems sensible, that she is committed to consulting and receiving inputs from the primary stakeholders in the education process, that is, the teachers and parents of students in the affected schools across the country. Can Irani please enlighten us with the data so collected? What percentage of parents want their kids to compulsorily learn Sanskrit? If a majority of parents want this to happen, then make Sanskrit mandatory according to the region’s recommendation; if not, then can we revert to status quo ante? Must everything that the Congress did change?
To what purpose?

India  Russia  here and nowWritten by C Raja Mohan |
Posted: December 10, 2014 12:55 am
When he met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the margins of the BRICS summit in Fortaleza, Brazil, in July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi apparently told him that every child in India knew Moscow was Delhi’s best friend forever.
As they sit down for a longer and substantive conversation in Delhi this week, Modi and Putin know they have a problem. The geopolitical circumstances that bound India and Russia close together for so long have begun to change. The structure of the partnership, too, is looking less special amid extended stagnation. Modi, who has boldly moved to rejuvenate India’s ties with America and Japan and devised a more positive approach towards China, must now go back to basics on Russia and find productive ways of boosting bilateral relations in an adverse regional and international environment.
In Moscow, it was Putin who saved the relationship from becoming irrelevant to both countries. In the 1990s, India found it hard to get post-Soviet Russia’s attention, as Moscow sought to integrate itself with the West and build a “Common European Home” stretching from the Baltic to the Pacific. Much hard work of Indian diplomats and strong faith in Delhi’s political class helped sustain the relationship with Russia through the difficult decade. It was only when Putin took charge of Russia at the turn of the new millennium that the bilateral relationship took a turn for the better.
That Putin had a working relationship with the West made India’s task relatively simple. Unlike in the Cold War, Delhi simply had to engage both Russia and the West, dealing with each on its own merit. Modi, however, will find the going somewhat difficult as Russia’s relations rapidly deteriorate.
The tension between Nato’s relentless expansion eastwards and Moscow’s determination to restore its traditional sphere of influence in the “near abroad” has been gathering for a while and finally boiled over in Ukraine this year. The idea of a Common European Home stands shattered. Russia and the West are finding it difficult to restore the rules of the road invented at the end of the Cold War in Europe, during 1989-91, or devise new ones that are acceptable to both sides. If the crisis in Europe lasts too long and Russia drifts away from the West, there will be new constraints on India’s foreign policy. There is no question of Delhi supporting Western sanctions against Russia, but the secondary effects of these measures are likely to corrode India’s ties with America and Europe.
India avoided endorsing Putin’s annexation of Crimea by force in Ukraine and then legitimising it by a “referendum”. After all, Delhi is rejecting Pakistan’s demands for a “plebiscite” in Kashmir. But you don’t want to reproach your friends in public. Delhi, therefore, kept quiet, much in the manner that it refused to publicly criticise Moscow when it sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979.

Former MP's daughter racially abused in Bangalore
The 34-year-old daughter of retired top cop and former Bengaluru North MP HT Sangliana was racially abused and assaulted by two burqa-clad women at a supermarket.
Mail Today –  Wed 10 Dec, 2014

BANGALORE: The IT capital of the nation, Bengaluru, is fast becoming notorious for incidents of racial abuse and assault on people from North-east India.
In the latest incident, the fifth in the past three months, the 34-year-old daughter of retired top cop and former Bengaluru North MP H.T. Sangliana was racially abused and assaulted by two burqa-clad women at a supermarket.
Sangliana, who was police commissioner of Bengaluru city, retired as Karnataka Director General of Police in 2003. His life was chronicled in a three-instalment Kannada movie series - Sangliana.
After retirement, he joined the BJP and represented Bengaluru North in the 14th Lok Sabha. Later he joined the Congress, but could not retain his seat.
The incident occurred last Sunday afternoon when the victim, Rachel, who is of Mizo origin and a mother of two, was shopping at a supermarket in Adugodi, south Bengaluru.
Rachel, who was standing in a queue to pay the grocery bill, took exception when a couple, including a woman in a burqa, tried to break the line - and advised them to wait for their turn.
This infuriated the unidentified woman, who started shouting abuse and cursing in Hindi and Urdu.
Apparently, she told Rachel that she was an “outsider” and people like her were ruining Bengaluru. She even told Rachel that she should be taught a lesson so that people of her origin returned to China.
Rachel, who did not want to be cowed, replied that she too was an Indian, and that she was born and brought up in Bengaluru.
A verbal duel ensued, with the burqa-clad woman eventually pushing Rachel. However, none of the other shoppers came to her rescue. The burqa-clad woman then left the scene.
Rachel telephoned her husband, who advised her to inform the police as a precaution. In the meantime, the burqa-clad woman returned with an acquaintance.
Even before Rachel could react, the two launched an attack, punching, kicking and pulling her hair.
By then, the customer service executives and three girls from Nagaland had come to Rachel’s aid. They managed to rescue her from the burqa-clad women, who continued to shower her with racial abuse.
The victim then called the police. But before they could arrive, the two women had disappeared from the supermarket.
Rachel said: “It was a very disturbing experience for me… Other shoppers and the Nagaland girls stood by me till my husband arrived at the supermarket.”
The police reviewed the video footage of the CCTV but could not identify the assailants. They have taken images of the two women and circulated those.
The police added: “The probe is on… We are in the process of identifying them.”

Marijuana Legalization: The Big Tobacco Smokescreenreddit
Big Marijuana? It's catchy, but comparing legalized marijuana to the tobacco industry misleads both the public and policymakers about the challenges of regulating this industry.
First, there already is a marijuana industry. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 4.6 million people sell illegal drugs every year. And given that marijuana is the most popular illegal drug, most of them sell pot. The NSDUH also reveals that the number of people who grow marijuana for personal use has increased from 206,000 in 2003 to 477,000 in 2012. These statistics, along with annual Drug Enforcement Administration data about seizures of marijuana grow rooms (2,596) and marijuana plants from them (302,377) in just 2012 provide a bare but impressive sketch of a thriving illegal and unregulated marijuana industry.  Big Pot is already here. It has been around for a while and it was created by the federal policy of marijuana prohibition.
So the question is not whether or not America wants to have a marijuana industry, but what sort of regulations are appropriate for providing more regulation and control than exists now.
Second, it's a big mistake to create public policy based on analogy, and a bigger one to ignore the mistakes that were made creating failed policies that need replacement. This point is discussed in detail in a recent article in the Harm Reduction Journal , which includes the following arguments.
Comparing a legal marijuana market to the current tobacco market is clever, but good spin doesn't make good policy. One of the mistakes of prohibition derived from comparing marijuana to heroin. For people who oppose marijuana legalization, the comparison to tobacco makes good sense; after all, marijuana and tobacco are both smoked, tobacco use is unpopular, and tobacco companies have been widely condemned in recent decades.
Why not compare marijuana to alcohol instead? After all, both substances are viewed as creating impairment and intoxication. There was once a time when comparisons between marijuana and tobacco were dismissed on account that smoking tobacco doesn't create such impairment. Critics of marijuana legalization avoid the comparison with alcohol because alcohol is not as unpopular as tobacco these days. More important, a comparison of marijuana with alcohol introduces an unwanted distinction into the debate, the issue of use versus abuse. Alcohol use has risks, but many Americans use it responsibly. In fact, the same is true for marijuana.  Marijuana use has risks, but many Americans use it responsibly. And, like the alcohol industry, the marijuana industry can play an important role in promoting responsible use.
The bigger mistake in comparing marijuana to tobacco, and to alcohol for that matter, is that they are different drugs. They have different pharmacological effects, pose different risks to the human body, have different dependence liabilities and have different patterns of use. Tobacco, for example, is one of the most addictive substances known to man, with a dependence liability similar to that of heroin. It is also used frequently in the course of a day, with a consumption range of 10 to 40 cigarettes a day. Marijuana has a much lower dependence liability and has a consumption range of 1 to 4 cigarettes a day, if even that among many users.
There are many differences between marijuana and tobacco. One of the key ones for this debate is that tobacco is a processed product, created by an industrial manufacturing process, in an industry controlled by a handful of firms. Marijuana can be grown by anyone, grown just about anywhere, and is most often consumed in its natural form. Marijuana prohibition is unenforceable because government has been unable to enforce strict controls over its production. There is now, and there will be under legalization, a competitive market in producing and selling marijuana. The legal market will be big, but the industry will be diverse -- whether regulatory policy takes this lesson into account or not.
There are a lot of common sense regulations needed in a legal marijuana market. There must be an age-limit on sales restricting access to adults. Marijuana should be labeled with respect to potency and certification that it has not been contaminated by mold or other dangers. There need to be standards for enforcement of laws against driving while impaired. And there will be taxes.
However, marijuana regulations need to be devised on solid information and experience, and not on the basis of superficial analogies, and most certainly not based on hypocrisy. Big Marijuana already exists -- it's also called the Black Market. Public concern over a large, unregulated, socially irresponsible marijuana market is, and should be, argument number one in support of marijuana's legalization.

If you've ever wondered what an asteroid impact on the Earth would look like in slow motion, have a look at this incredible new video (above) from researchers at the University of Minnesota.
In the video, a raindrop stands in for the asteroid, and a layer of sand stands in for the surface of the Earth. As the drop falls onto the sand, the granular surface deforms into a crater . The researchers say it's very similar, on a tiny scale, to what happens when a space rock smashes into our planet.

I Am The Last Guy On Earth You Want To Listen To About Oprah Winfrey!Email
Comment
I am aware that I am the last guy you want to turn to for any kind of objective review about Oprah. I mean, come on, I am anything but objective. In life, you are blessed if you have even a short list of true friends, and if you do, you love and support them, period. I feel that way about Oprah, not just because of everything she has done for my family and me, which is admittedly beyond generous, but it goes deeper than that.
Over the 17 years I have come to know her, I mean really know her, I have seen who she is, in good times and in bad (yes, even Oprah has tough times, just like everyone else). I have seen how she behaves when the world is not watching, how she treats people who don't even know it's her doing the treating (yes, she's that thoughtful). I have seen her heart and her mind, her conduct, her intent, and her actions. So, yeah, I confess I have a built-in core bias that is unwavering. I see her through a filter of love and respect that will never change. Which is why, when it comes to Oprah or her projects, you don't want to listen to me — until now.
I did something with Oprah last night you do need to hear about from me.
This past Saturday night, Robin and I went to Santa Barbara for a private screening of the soon-to-be released movie "Selma." An Oprah project. She is in it and she is one of the executive producers, so ordinarily, this would be one of those "don't listen to me" moments. But this is different. This movie is so not about Oprah. This movie is about you. It is about you, and it is about me, and you absolutely must see it. I don't care if you have to take off work to get to the theater after it opens on Christmas Day!
"Selma" is about the very soul of America in 1965 and, in an eerie twist of timing, it is about the very soul of America right now, this minute. I believe it is one of those iconic movies that will become an instant classic; it will impact how you think and feel — and hopefully how you and I behave — about human dignity, human rights and your personal values and responsibilities for the rest of our lives. Despite the subject matter, it is not about politics, guilt, anger, violence or bitterness. It is about courage, inspiration and commitment.
Take a minute to look at the trailer so what I am saying will have a better context. Watch it here.
I watched Robin watch this movie in the dark of the historic Arlington Theatre and saw visible waves of pain cross her face when "Bloody Sunday" and other indignities were depicted as they played out in Selma, Alabama. I saw the joy and pride in her face as she stood and cheered at other moments that portrayed hard-earned victories. As for me, I was spellbound emotionally and intellectually. I was all in from the minute I saw Oprah's character, Annie Lee Cooper, filling out a form with such great care, a form I knew was going in the trash. It was heartbreaking.
Afterward, as part of the weekend event called "The Legends Who Paved the Way," we attended an amazing celebratory dinner joined by many of the heroes portrayed in the movie, along with other legends who found the courage to change and mature this country.
Dinner conversation was very interesting, to say the least. David and Yolanda Foster, Magic and Cookie Johnson, and Nancy O'Dell and her husband, Keith, were at our table, and we all were drawn to discussing the amazing — perhaps divine — timeliness of this movie, given what is playing out on the streets of cities across America at this very moment. It makes you ask: "How much progress have we really made or at least held on to?" I do think progress has been made but obviously, much more work remains to be done.
This movie was so well done, it transported me back in time to that tension-filled time in our country. I was in high school in Kansas City, where racial tensions over segregation ran very high. I remember it well. I watched the happenings in Selma on television along with 70 million other Americans and more around the world. But we now have an entire generation who did not live through it and for whom this movie will be a huge, educational, game-changing wake-up call.
A major contrast to modern-day events did impact me though. Martin Luther King and his demonstrators were highly organized and extremely disciplined, as opposed to some of what we have seen in more recent times. Back then, it seems the commitment to a non-violent philosophy, even to the point of undergoing training on how to deal with provocation without reaction, kept the focus on the objective. These men and women did not attack and certainly did not turn to the destructive acts of burning, looting and assaulting. They did not permit or tolerate a thuggish few to use such an important issue as an excuse to commit crimes and discredit the movement important to so many. I also saw what felt, at least to me, like an "impatience" on the part of authorities recently that, while clearly dramatically more restrained than in 1965, just had a troublesome feel to it.
We also discussed a question that continues to haunt me even as I type this: Would I have had the courage to walk that bridge in Selma in 1965? Walk unarmed, unprotected, directly into the teeth of an army of angry bigots held to absolutely no account, prepared to bash my head in with a baseball bat, wrapped in barbed wire? Would I have been OK doing so with my wife walking right by my side to get her head bashed in? How about you? Would you take that walk for what you believed? I have spent the day with an uneasiness of mind. Perhaps it is because I don't know the answer to the question. Or maybe it's because I do.
Oprah and her amazing cast and team have given us a gift in "Selma." She just continues to make a life-changing difference for so many. Thanks girl! (Again.)
OK, now you can all go back to not listening to me when I weigh in about Oprah, because like I said, I'm just not objective.

Liverpool crash out of Champions LeagueBasel through despite late Gerrard strike for Liverpool

Liverpool's Steven Gerrard reacts after losing to FC Basel in their Champions …
LIVERPOOL (Reuters) - Liverpool's Champions League challenge ended in a 1-1 draw against FC Basel, who booked their spot in the last 16 on Tuesday after withstanding a late fightback sparked by a stunning Steven Gerrard free kick.
Gerrard curled the ball into the top corner with eight minutes remaining to cancel out Fabian Frei's rasping first-half drive, but the Premier League side, who had been reduced to 10 men following the second half sending off of Lazar Markovic, could not find the crucial winner.
Barring their late flurry, it was a largely a dismal home performance from Liverpool who finished third in Group B on five points, two adrift of second place Basel.
Liverpool, whose poor start to the season shows no sign of improving, will now drop into the less demanding Europa League.
Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers may have hoped the occasion would spark an improved attacking performance from his struggling side, but within minutes of the kickoff it was very much business as usual as the visitors grabbed the upper hand over their nervy hosts.
It took only 12 minutes for Basel to craft an early sight of goal as Shkelzen Gashi found a pocket of space on the edge of the area but slashed his shot wide.
That proved to be an unheeded warning as Liverpool retreated further into their shell and Basel grew in confidence before taking the lead in stylish fashion on 25 minutes.
After some crisp and careful passing around the edge of the Liverpool area, the ball was touched back to Frei, who flashed a daisy-cutter across the Anfield turf and into the back of Simon Mignolet's net with the Liverpool keeper rooted to the spot.
The match threatened to turn into a horror show for the hosts as Basel spurned further chances with Marco Streller spooning a volley off target and Gashi rippling the net once more with an offside flag sparing Liverpool's blushes.
Rodgers hauled Alberto Moreno and Markovic off the bench in an effort to inject some urgency, but the latter's night lasted just 15 minutes as he was sent off for flicking out his hand and catching the face of Behrang Safari who dramatically tumbled to the ground.
Referee Bjorn Kuipers angered the Liverpool fans further by denying Gerrard a penalty when he tumbled under the challenge of Basel keeper Tomas Vaclik, minutes before the Liverpool midfielder picked his spot superbly with a free kick from the left-hand edge of the area.

(Birte Hald, head of emergency…)
NEW YORK: Doctors, nurses and others fighting Ebola through "tireless acts of courage and mercy" have been named Time's 2014 Person of the Year, the magazine announced Wednesday.
The runners-up included Ferguson, Missouri, protesters; Russian President Vladimir Putin; Kurdish Regional Government President Massoud Barzani; and Jack Ma , the China-based founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba.
Time's editor, Nancy Gibbs, praised "the people in the field, the special forces of Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the Christian medical-relief workers of Samaritan's Purse and many others from all over the world" who "fought side by side with local doctors and nurses, ambulance drivers and burial teams."
Gibbs noted that the disease has struck doctors and nurses.
"The rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight," she wrote.
Antoine Petibon, head of international programs for the French Red Cross , which has been active in Guinea's anti-Ebola efforts, called it "great recognition for all these people who have been toiling in the shadows."
The disease has taken its toll in myriad ways.
In September, a team trying to inform villagers about Ebola in the forests of southern Guinea was attacked by a mob. The bodies of eight people _ two local administrators, two medical officers, a preacher and three journalists, were found stuffed in a latrine.
Less than a month after arriving in Guinea, Cuban Dr. Jorge Juan Guerra Rodriguez died of malaria.
Henry Gray, MSF operations coordinator for the Ebola response in Guinea and Liberia, said the spotlight should be on the patients and the thousands of people in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Mali "who are doing their best to deal with this horrendous outbreak."
Gray, speaking by phone from Conakry, the Guinea capita, said, "We are happy for this recognition but will be even happier when the last Ebola treatment center is closed and the crisis is declared over."
Birte Hald, head of emergency operations for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said "front-line fighters" deserve recognition.
"People like myself, we are working hard, but we are not at risk," Hald said from Nairobi. "People doing the safe and dignified burials, the contact tracing and the transport of the sick, working in the treatment centers _ these are the people who deserve our praise and respect."
White House press secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama and his administration "could not be prouder of the brave men and women who have committed themselves to this effort in a foreign land. ... But we must not forget that in order to bring this epidemic under control on the front lines, indeed the only way to prevent additional cases here in the United States, we need more of these medical professionals."
Christos Stylianides, European Union Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, agreed.
"We urgently need more health workers on the ground," said Stylianides. "The crisis is not over, and will not be unless we scale up the numbers of medical staff, field hospitals, laboratories and humanitarian aid."

(All told, IBM and Apple announced…)
OAKLAND: Apple and IBM, once the most unlikely of allies, on Wednesday announced the first fruits of a partnership aimed at developing new mobile software - and selling more mobile devices - to business customers.
One new app, developed jointly by the two companies, promises to help telecom service workers find their way to customer appointments in the field more quickly, using the GPS on an iPhone or iPad . Another would let flight attendants help passengers change their connecting reservations in mid-air.
All told, IBM and Apple announced 10 new business-oriented programs for Apple's popular iPhones and iPads, which are already used widely in commercial settings.
There are already a variety of apps available for restaurants, retailers and other businesses, but many are produced by smaller companies or independent developers. Despite a history of rivalry, the two tech giants announced a partnership over the summer to create a series of business-focused apps that combine IBM's data analytics prowess and knowledge of business requirements with Apple's skill at creating elegant, user-friendly products.
``This is actually not easy. It's not like playing Angry Birds,'' Bridget van Kralingen, an International Business Machines Corp. senior vice president, said in an interview. She boasted that the new products combine online data analytics and ``industrial-strength security'' in programs that resemble easier-to-use consumer apps.
While Apple Inc. is known primarily for consumer products, tech rivals like Google and even Facebook have been moving into the lucrative commercial market. And increasingly, analysts say, many businesses are trying to accommodate employees who want to use devices and software that resemble what they use at home.
IBM will take the lead in selling the new mobile software, van Kralingen said, but both companies say the partnership should also help Apple sell more devices to business customers. Apple Senior Vice President Philip Schiller also suggested it's not such a stretch for Apple to build business software. The number of companies using iPhones and iPads is ``just astronomical, so we already are in the enterprise market,'' he said in an interview.
Executives said engineers from IBM, which is based in Armonk, New York, and Apple, which is headquartered in Cupertino, California, worked together on the new apps. They also include specialized programs for airline pilots, bankers, insurance agents, sales clerks and government case workers.

ZURICH: Wannabe jetsetters can now hail a private plane anywhere in the world from their smartphones thanks to an app that makes luxury air travel more accessible, at least to those who can afford the $7,000 membership.
JetSmarter, the brain child of Sergey Petrossov , 26, allows users to hire a jet in a matter of seconds. "Our goal as a company is to democratise private aviation," he told Reuters in Zurich, where the company will open a European office in 2015.
Launched in March last year, the app has been downloaded over 300,000 times and facilitated more than 1,000 flights so far in 2014.
While the average ticket costs around $20,000, those who become members for $7,000 a year can get free or discounted "empty legs" flights, which travel empty when a plane returns to its home base after dropping off passengers,
The average JetSmarter member is tech-savvy, aged between 25 and 50 and earns at least $1 million a year, according to Petrossov. A-list celebrities, royalty and sheiks are among its users.
Some of the most popular routes include the " Golden Triangle " between Miami, New York and Los Angeles. But almost anything is possible. JetSmarter once received a request to transport a tonne of gold between South America and Europe.

Credit Suisse Technology Conference
(Microsoft has not publicly…)
SEATTLE: Microsoft Corp expects to have its new Windows 10 operating system on the market by autumn 2015, slightly later than previous comments had suggested.
Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner told Japanese news service Nikkei on Wednesday that the new system would be released "early next fall."
Microsoft has not publicly set a firm timetable for the release of Windows 10, but only last week suggested the possibility of an earlier release.
"By next late summer and early fall we'll be able to bring out this particular OS (operating system). That's the current plan of record," Turner told the Credit Suisse Technology Conference last Thursday.
An autumn release would put Windows 10 on track for launch three years after Windows 8, which got a mixed reception as it confused many traditional PC users with a design more suited to tablets.
Microsoft unveiled the name Windows 10 in late September, saying the jump in numbers from 8 to 10 marked a leap as it looks to unify the way people work on tablets, phones and traditional computers.
An early test version of Windows 10 - which blends the traditional look and much-loved start menu with newer features - has been available for download from Microsoft's website for more than two months.
Windows is still a core part of Microsoft's business and dominates the desktop computing market with 1.5 billion users. But the growth of smartphones and tablets means Windows now runs on only about 14 percent of computing devices worldwide, according to tech research firm Gartner.

Online retailer eBay Inc is mulling over a plan to cut thousands of jobs early next year, as it readies to spin off its PayPal unit, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the company's thinking.
"We are focused on running the business and setting eBay and PayPal up for success as independent companies," eBay spokeswoman Amanda Miller said, declining to specifically comment on whether the company was considering layoffs.
Ebay is considering eliminating almost 10 percent of its workforce, or about 3,000 employees, the WSJ cited one source as saying.
The cuts are expected to be localized in the company's marketplace division, the report said.
The spin-off, announced in September, highlighted the slowing growth of eBay's traditional marketplace business.

Harvard Business School prof says hes sorry for rant over $4 overchargeBy Elahe Izadi December 10, 2014 Follow @ElaheIzadi
Harvard, in all its glory. (Lisa Poole/AP)
You’ve already heard about the Harvard Business School professor’s angry e-mails to a Chinese restaurant manager because of a $4 overcharge, right?
Sure you have !
The e-mail exchange got loads of attention after getting published by Boston.com  on Tuesday.
In his e-mails to Ran Duan of the Sichuan Garden and the Baldwin Bar, Ben Edelman, an associate professor at the elite business school , demanded a $12 refund, citing the “Massachusetts consumer protection statute, MGL93a, wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations.” It is, Edelman wrote, “a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price.” He noted that he had referred the matter “to applicable authorities.”
After having seen the matter referred to the court of public opinion, where he has not fared particularly well, Edelman now says he’s sorry for the hubbub.
In an apology   posted Wednesday afternoon on his Web site , Edelman wrote: “Having reflected on my interaction with Ran, including what I said and how I said it, it’s clear that I was very much out of line. I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation. Clearly I failed to do so. I am sorry, and I intend to do better in the future.”
Edelman, who is an attorney in addition to a professor, said that he’s reached out to Duan and plans to personally apologize to him.
Duan manages the bar inside Sichuan Garden’s Woburn location, a restaurant his parents opened in Brookline in the 1990s, according to Boston.com. In his e-mails to Edelman, Duan apologized for the outdated prices on the restaurant’s Web site.
Things got out of hand after that, with requests for refunds and arguments over the disclaimer on the restaurant Web site.
It seemed … a bit much.
“I personally respond to every complaint and try to handle every situation personally,” Duan told Boston.com. “I have worked so hard to make my family proud and to elevate our business.”
The e-mail exchange with Edelman “just broke my heart,” he said.
After the Boston.com story was published, embarrassed Harvard Business School students set up a fundraising page for the Greater Boston Food Bank , noting that “negative stereotypes of Harvard and HBS were reinforced” by Edelman’s e-mails.
The professor’s apology came a day after he wrote to the Boston Globe  that he had reached out to town officials, who responded that “they wouldn’t be able to help.”
“I wonder how many consumers were overcharged before I flagged the issue and pressed the restaurant to remove the false statements on its Web site,” Edelman wrote to the Globe.
I wonder how many Harvard professors will cite state statutes when reviewing Chinese takeout orders. After this episode, probably none.

NEW YORK: Goldman Sachs , Wall Street's biggest dealmaker, has surpassed $1 trillion in mergers and acquisitions for a single year for the first time since the financial crisis.
The US investment bank passed the closely-watched benchmark for 2014 following transactions this week, according to data Wednesday from Dealogic.
The last time a firm surpassed $1 trillion in a year came in 2007, when Goldman also breached the level.

Can housing societies refuse tenants?

House-hunting, once upon a time, was all about finding a place suitable for you, within your budget and in your favourite destination. However, now-a-days, along with these, people also ask for a copy of the housing society’s law as well!
You could think “why housing society’s laws?” Well, these are the laws which govern the kind of tenants that the housing society can have. Under these laws, bachelors and families with pets are refused permission to reside in particular housing societies. Moreover, families with special kids as well as homosexual parents are also finding it difficult to even approach house owners, let alone rent a house!

Housing society laws
So how are these housing society laws formed? Once the housing society comes into being, it is then registered. The housing society then has the power to frame its own guidelines and bye-laws to govern its day-to-day functioning and smooth running. Day-to-day functioning includes governance of structures, common area maintenance rights, do's & don'ts, accounting practices and various other covenants associated with leasing/ purchasing a house within the society. Along with these laws, there are other specific laws addressing tenant; that's where "refusal of tenants' comes into the picture. These laws are specific and discriminatory; hence when deeply probed, some of these are found to be completely prejudiced and archaic. They are extremely arbitrary, and subject to innumerable interpretations and frequent changes.
Most affected groups
Bachelors
The group that is most affected by housing laws are bachelors, especially as a majority of housing societies do not accept bachelors as tenants. They are believed to rough-up the place and create nuisance for other members of the society. They are often found to lack stability with regards to sticking to a particular rental place for long; hence they do not provide stability of rental income to the owner, and hence hey are refused accommodation.
Paying guests
Paying guests are another group who are not entertained by many housing societies. Housing society laws make it clear that they have no or poor control on the flow of people to their premises if there are paying guests living in the housing society. Often bye-laws are not applicable as they are not owners or tenants and hence many housing societies do not welcome paying guests with open arms.
Families with pets
Families with pets too are refused accommodation by many housing societies for the fear of pets dirtying common areas or harming children. Besides, there are numerous complaints that have been received about dog bites and attacks in housing societies that allow pets.
Families with special children or people belonging to a particular religion
Families with special children and with members suffering from mental health problems are often refused accommodation due to the social stigma attached to such individuals. India, despite its progress in many fields of activity, is yet to change its mind-set towards such individuals. Sadly, horrific stories are often heard about the discrimination against families with such members. Sometimes people belonging to a particular religion or even those with a particular meal preference are refused accommodation under these laws.
Even though refusal to provide accommodation to such classes of people is illegal, it is still prevalent in many housing societies.
How to manage finances with roommates
Can housing society refusal be beneficial?
Are housing society laws always discriminatory? Even though, most of the time the answer is yes, their refusal in certain cases proves to be good for other residents. A housing society can refuse accommodation to tenants who are involved in criminal activities and with violent behaviour. Numerous instances of abusive behaviour causing distress to women and children as well as violent behaviour due to excessive drinking have been reported. The housing society is within its rights to refuse accommodation to such individuals if such instances are regularly brought to their notice.
People who use residences for business purposes act as a nuisance to other members living in the same housing society. With no control on the kind of business they undertake or their customers who frequent the area, they are certainly not welcome in most housing societies.

Despite price crash  oil traders buy $100 options | Oil hits $60Mobius Risk Group
(Some argue that it is an opportune…)
NEW YORK: Oil traders have been quietly buying cheap, far out-of-the-money call options at $100 a barrel, betting that the biggest sell-off since the financial crisis has gone too far and that crude is likely to rebound by this time next year.
Open interest in US crude oil $100 calls for December 2015 has jumped 13 per cent in the last two weeks to nearly 37,000 on Wednesday, with a premium of around 40 cents.
For the December 2016 $100 calls, open interest has surged by more than 50 per cent to nearly 16,000, with a premium of around $1.00, according to exchange data.
With US crude oil futures for January hovering at just above $60 a barrel, down from nearly $108 a barrel in June, traders aren't likely counting on those options to expire in the money but rather betting that their value will increase provided oil prices bottom out or begin to creep up next year.
"People don't trade options because they think the price will necessarily get there. They're looking for relatively good value," said John Saucer, vice president of research and analytics at Mobius Risk Group in Houston.
"The question is: How do you get the most bang for your buck?" he said.
Since the summer, oversupplied global markets coupled with lackluster demand kicked off a sell-off in both the US crude and Brent contracts. The sell-off accelerated following the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) meeting in Vienna last month, when member countries decided not to cut production amid speculation of a price war.
The motivations for investors to have so many open contracts in those two months at $100 are not immediately clear. High levels of activity in December are not a surprise as it is among the most liquid months of the year for hedging.
Yet, some argue that it is an opportune moment to buy as falling prices have increased the put skew - the difference in implied volatility for out-of-the-money and in-the-money options - allowing more upside potential to the call side.
"There are too many guys on the short side now," said one trader.

States to get Rs 11 k cr for cut in CST: Aru...Arun Jaitley
(Jaitley's statement comes…)
NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley has announced the release of Rs 11,000 crore to states as compensation for the reduction in central sales tax to bridge the "trust deficit" between the Centre and the states and get them to support the proposed goods and services tax (GST).
The minister's statement comes ahead of his meeting with state finance ministers on Thursday to discuss the constitutional amendment bill required to facilitate GST , which seeks to replace multiple indirect taxes at central and state level with a single levy thus creating a common market. Jaitley also promised a "civilised" tax regime to attract overseas investments and pledged to meet the fiscal deficit target of 4.1% of GDP.
"One of the major reasons for this trust deficit is non-payment of the CST (central sales tax) compensation to the states from 2010 onwards... Despite a difficult and challenging situation, I propose to release about Rs 11,000 crore, which is one-third this year, as part payment of CST compensation to the states," Jaitley said, replying to the discussion on the supplementary demands for grants in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.
Jaitley said this will take care of the amount from 2010-11 onwards and the balance amount would be given from the next financial year, seeking the support of the house on the crucial indirect tax reform. "GST is not an issue on which we are divided on partisan lines. Most state governments are going to benefit.
The revenues are going to improve as far as the Centre is concerned, states are concerned and I wish to assure this House with this commitment," the finance minister said. The supplementary demands amount to additional expenditure of more than Rs 12,500 crore. However, the actual cash outgo would be Rs 500 crore. The demand was later passed by the House.While justifying the diffineed for a "civilised" tax regime, Jaitley took a dig at the previous government saying an "ultra-aggressive tax policy" has not helped in getting any additional revenue.He said retrospective tax changes by the previous United Progressive Alliance government had only brought a "bad name" to India rather than garner any additional revenue.
"We inherited an economic situation of negative sentiment, where none was willing to invest. There was reduced economic activity. The negative sentiment was further accelerated by (an) ultra-aggressive tax policy," he said.Referring to the select committee report on further opening the insurance sector, Jaitley said, "Large investments are waiting to come in. We have to open the doors."
The committee has suggested a composite foreign investment cap of 49% in the insurance sector, as against 26% foreign direct investment (FDI) cap currently. A composite limit allows portfolio investors as well, making the sector more attractive. He said the FDI regime has already been relaxed in the defence sector and this has generated a lot of interest from top global manufacturers.
On growth prospects, Jaitley said India faced challenges but hoped that these would be within the projected range of 5.4-5.9% in 2014-15 and cross 6% in the next financial year. Economic growth slowed below 5% in 2012-14, he said, adding this had an impact on revenue collection, the fiscal deficit and the government's expenditure on developmental works.
He said the government would meet the fiscal deficit target as this was important in terms of how India is perceived. "I am determined to maintain that because if we don't maintain that figure, the world and the global investors would look at us. Our rating is dependent on that. Alot depends on how the world views you."

Investor interest in Indian realty likely to...economy
(The positive sentiment…)
MUMBAI: Major property markets including Mumbai, New Delhi and Bangalore are likely to witness more appetite for real estate investment with significant rise in rankings of these cities, showed a perception study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Urban Land Institute .
Outlook for Indian property markets has improved among both domestic and overseas investors with the formation of a stable government at the Centre, said the report. Rankings, as perceived by over 300 respondents globally, of Mumbai, New Delhi and Bangalore have also jumped to 11th, 14th and 17th positions, respectively, in the list of top 25 investment destinations covered in the report titled Emerging Trends in Real Estate Asia Pacific 2015. In the previous survey for 2014, these cities were placed at 23rd, 21st and 20th rank, respectively.
"Mumbai has climbed the most in ranking among the cities in the survey. There is certainly a positive vibe complemented by the expectation of an improved economy and a more transparent environment, keeping interest levels up among investors," said Gautam Mehra , partner, PwC India.
The positive sentiment can be measured from the fact that global real estate funds focused on India are seeking to raise $6 billion in new capital, on top of $1.6 billion raised in the first seven months of 2014. Most of this new capital being raised is aimed at residential projects. The improvement in perception of decision makers including fund managers, occupiers and developers is expected to bring more liquidity to the sector and this may ease cost of capital for realty developers marginally, he added.
Prices of commercial properties in Mumbai have remained stable, while rentals were showing signs of inching up as local businesses showed interest in rolling out expansion plans. Since occupancy that stands at 80% now, were expected to rise, price and rents were likely to increase too, especially for well-located premises, the report added.
While in New Delhi, commercial properties were already witnessing a rebound on the back of a rise in leasing activities, post the 2014 general elections. The PwC-ULI report is based on survey responses from over 380 executives working for fund houses property developers, investors, realty services firms, banks, investment managers, etc.
The report highlighted Tokyo, Jakarta, Osaka, Sydney and Melbourne as the top 5 investment destinations for 2015.

KOLKATA: Korean consumer electronics giant Samsung is restructuring its leadership team in India as part of its global reorganisation plan.
BD Park, managing director of Samsung India and president of South West Asia operations, is relocating to headquarters in Korea after six years of his Indian stint during which he made the Korean firm the country's largest consumer electronics and smartphone maker with more than Rs 40,000 crore revenue. Park, also the longest senior executive of Samsung to be stationed in India, is going to become a global business head, two senior industry executives aware of the development said.
Samsung Electronics Latin America president HyunChil Hong is going to take over as the new president of the Southwest Asia regional headquarters whereby he will become the new MD of Samsung India.
At the same time, Samsung India's deputy MD Ravinder Zutshi is retiring from the company by end of this month, two senior industry executives said. Zutshi, who has been one of the first employees of Samsung India, was recently heading government relations for the firm in India. Despite repeated attempts, Zutshi could not be reached till press time. One of the executives quoted above said some more changes are likely in the Indian operation due to the global restructuring.
This may include some change of roles for the Korean vertical heads and senior Indian counterparts, since globally the company has just integrated its media solution or content service and B2B business with respective businesses.
The changes come at a time when Samsung globally elevated Indian engineer Pranav Mistry as vice president of global operations. He was earlier the vice president of R&D and head of think tank team based in the US.

Senate Report Says Torture Program Was More Gruesome  Widespread Than CIA ClaimedSenate Report Says Torture Program Was More Gruesome, Widespread Than CIA Claimed

WASHINGTON -- The Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday released the highly anticipated 500-page summary of its report on the CIA’s post-9/11 torture program, providing a sobering glimpse into one of the darkest chapters in the U.S. government's history.
In the report, a product of a 5-year investigation, Senate investigators reveal sordid details of the systemic and individual failures by the agency personnel who ran the "enhanced interrogation program" -- the government's euphemism for systematic torture -- during the George W. Bush administration. The program involved capturing terrorism suspects and shipping them to secret overseas prisons, where they were subjected to techniques such as waterboarding.
The CIA's program has long been criticized as un-American and a chilling departure from the nation’s values. Opponents allege that it resulted in gross abuses and inhumane treatment of detainees, some of whom were eventually revealed not to have been involved in terror organizations.
The 6,300-page report may be the most unsanitized official account to date of the agency’s program, which the Senate investigators say was mismanaged, poorly conducted and characterized by abuses far more widespread than the CIA previously conveyed to lawmakers.
The newly released document tears apart the CIA's past claims that only a small number of detainees were subjected to the harsh interrogation techniques. The agency has said it held fewer than 100 detainees and subjected fewer than one-third of those to controversial tactics such as waterboarding. But Senate investigators found that the CIA had actually kept 119 detainees in custody, 26 of whom were illegally held. And despite CIA insistence that the program was limited in scope, Senate investigators conclude that the use of torture was much more widespread than previously thought.
The study reveals several gruesome instances of torture by mid-level CIA officers who participated in the program, including threats of sexual violence using a broomstick and the use of "rectal hydration" in instances of harsh interrogations that lasted for days or weeks on end. And, contrary to the agency's prior insistence that only three detainees were subject to waterboarding, the Senate report suggests it was likely used on more detainees.
The report cites the presence of materials typically used for waterboarding being present at certain "blacksites," or secret prisons, where the agency had previously said waterboarding was not used.
Rather than wrestling with the morality of the agency’s torture program or the operation's damaging effect on the U.S.’ international credibility, Senate investigators instead weighed whether the agency's tactics were effective. Through narrative examinations of 20 separate detainee cases, the panel attempted to make the case that the use of harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding did not yield valuable intelligence.
"The committee reviewed 20 of the most frequent and prominent examples of purported counterterrorism 'successes' that the CIA has attributed to the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques," Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chair of the intelligence panel, said in a statement Tuesday. "Each of those examples was found to be wrong in fundamental respects."
In some instances, the study finds, the information acquired proved irrelevant to stopping terror threats. In others, the use of the techniques resulted in detainees providing fabricated or inaccurate information, and in still other cases, the information obtained through interrogating the detainees had already been acquired through other techniques.
Given that the techniques were ineffective, the study says, the agency routinely misled Congress and the White House when it claimed that the use of torture did in fact contribute to intelligence victories. For instance, the Senate report pushes back against the CIA's argument that torture provided the information about Osama bin Laden's courier that helped the U.S. kill the al Qaeda leader in 2011. In a 10-page discussion on the subject, Senate investigators say the information that led the U.S. to bin Laden was obtained from a detainee while he was in foreign custody, prior to being subjected to torture.
The CIA, however, refutes these conclusions. In a roughly 100-page official response released alongside the intelligence panel’s summary, the agency contends that harsh interrogation techniques were effective.
“The sum total of information provided from detainees in CIA custody substantially advanced the Agency’s strategic and tactical understanding of the enemy in ways that continue to inform counterterrorism efforts to this day," the agency said in its rebuttal.
The response argues that it's not clear whether the valuable information could have been acquired by means other than harsh interrogation techniques, although the agency concedes that it's possible.
“It is impossible to imagine how CIA could have achieved the same results in terms of disrupting plots, capturing other terrorists, and degrading al-Qa’ida without any information from detainees, but it is unknowable whether, without enhanced interrogation techniques, CIA or non-CIA interrogators could have acquired the same information from those detainees," the rebuttal said.
Still, the CIA is not advocating a return to the use of torture during interrogations. Rather, it is most concerned with defending itself against charges that it misled Congress and the White House about the extent and value of the program. The official response vehemently challenges the Senate's allegation that the spies acted outside the limits of what the White House had allowed the agency to do. The agency has said that the enhanced interrogations were part of a government-approved program carried out under express orders from within the Bush administration.
"The image portrayed in the Study of an organization that—on an institutional scale—intentionally misled and routinely resisted oversight from the White House, the Congress, the Department of Justice, and its own OIG simply does not comport with the record,“ the agency's response said.
Among the Senate report’s 20 main conclusions are that the CIA misled Congress, the White House and the Department of Justice, that the agency ignored internal critiques of the program, and that the CIA's use of the techniques went far beyond the legal authority bestowed upon it by the Bush White House.
In a statement Tuesday , President Barack Obama said, "The report documents a troubling program involving enhanced interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects in secret facilities outside the United States, and it reinforces my long-held view that these harsh methods were not only inconsistent with our values as nation, they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests."
"That is why I will continue to use my authority as President to make sure we never resort to those methods again," Obama added.
"In carrying out that program, we did not always live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves and that the American people expect of us," CIA Director John Brennan said Tuesday in his official response. "As an Agency, we have learned from these mistakes, which is why my predecessors and I have implemented various remedial measures over the years to address institutional deficiencies."
The agency says it has no intention of revamping the current version of its interrogation program, which was curbed as a result of directives from Obama. "It is Director Brennan’s resolute intention to ensure that Agency officers scrupulously adhere to these directives, which the Director fully supports," the statement continued.
"CIA has owned up to these mistakes, learned from them, and taken numerous corrective actions over the years. Further improvements to CIA practices continue to be made today as a result of our review of the SSCI Study," the agency's response noted, referring to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the intelligence panel's full name.
The document’s release marks the conclusion of an explosive, high-stakes feud that played out between the White House’s chief spying agency and its powerful Senate overseers about how much of the report to release publicly.
The feud revolved around the executive branch's insistence that the committee redact the pseudonyms used to identify the mid-level CIA officers involved in the program. Despite a monthslong fight, Feinstein was ultimately forced to relent and allow the pseudonyms to remain blacked out in order to get her study's summary out the door before the panel's incoming Republican majority takes control of the report in January.
The study, which was first commissioned by Feinstein in 2009, began as a bipartisan effort with then-ranking member Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.). Republicans on the panel, though, withdrew from the study just months after it was commissioned.
The document released Tuesday will very likely be the only portion the public sees of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report. Although Feinstein suggested in April that the full report would be released at a later date, Republicans are not likely to seek further declassification once they gain control of the committee , given their opposition to the investigation.
The study set the stage for a dramatic, closed-door dispute between the agency and Feinstein, which resulted in deeply personal jabs and competing referrals to the Justice Department asking for criminal investigations. The CIA accused Feinstein’s staff early this year of taking highly sensitive material from the secure agency facility where the investigation was conducted. Feinstein, meanwhile, insisted the investigators had a right to the document, and further accused the agency of improperly monitoring the computers her staff used to construct the study.
The Department of Justice declined to investigate either the CIA's or Feinstein's allegations. The CIA has since conceded that it did improperly monitor Senate investigators’ computers, and is conducting an independent accountability review board to determine what consequences, if any, its employees should face.
This is a developing story and will be updated.

Here s What We Talked About Most On Facebook In 2014reddit
Last year it was Pope Francis, the Royal Baby and Miley Cyrus. But this year, our conversations -- Facebook conversations, that is -- were all about Ebola, the World Cup and the Ice Bucket Challenge.
Facebook released its Year In Review on Tuesday, listing the things its 1.35 billion monthly active users mentioned most in 2014. The social network published Top 10 lists ranking the most popular topics in several categories, including entertainers, movies and television.
In the U.S., the main topic for 2014 was Ebola, while the World Cup took the No. 1 spot globally . Our favorite entertainer was Beyonce (duh), and we rocked out to Pharrell's "Happy." George W. Bush had our favore Ice Bucket Challenge video.
To create the lists, Facebook measured the total number of posts that mentioned specific subjects (including abbreviations and some misspellings). It did not consider user engagement, including things like comments, likes or re-sharing.

China stimulus hopes lift Hong Kong, Shanghai stocks

(The Hang Seng Index added…)
HONG KONG: Hong Kong stocks edged up Wednesday after a two-day sell-off, while Shanghai rebounded strongly from the previous day's slump as more weak Chinese inflation data fuelled hopes for further easing measures.
The Hang Seng Index added 0.16 percent, or 38.69 points, to 23,524.52 on turnover of HK$109.93 billion ($14.18 billion).
In Shanghai the composite index, which slumped 5.43 percent Tuesday, surged 2.93 percent.
China's National Bureau of Statistics said inflation eased to a five-year low of 1.4 percent in November, down from 1.6 percent in October and below forecasts of 1.6 percent.
The figure is the latest showing the world's number two economy is under pressure and has fuelled hopes Beijing will introduce further measures to prop it up.
While the People's Bank of China unveiled a surprise interest rate cut last month, the growing list of weak readings has fed speculation that leaders will soon announce a cut in the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve and other stimulus measures.
Wednesday's gains came despite a largely negative lead from Wall Street where investors were spooked by Greece's decision to call a snap presidential election two months early, raising fears of fresh instability in the struggling economy.
The Dow fell 0.29 percent and the S&P 500 dipped 0.02 percent, but the Nasdaq added 0.54 percent.
The best performing stock on the Hang Seng on Wednesday was China General Nuclear Power, which surged 19.06 percent to HK$3.31 on its debut after raising more than US$3 billion in its initial public offering last week -- making it the city's biggest this year.
Among other shares, Power Assets Holdings climbed 1.36 percent to HK$74.50, energy giant CNOOC added 1.59 percent to HK$10.22 and Tsingtao Brewery was 0.18 percent higher at HK$55.10.
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing jumped 0.96 percent to HK$178.60 and Hang Seng Bank was 0.08 percent up at HK$127.00, but Cathay Pacific Airways fell 1.71 percent to HK$17.24.
In mainland China the Shanghai market added 83.74 points to 2,940.01 on turnover of 535.0 billion yuan ($86.7 billion).
The Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China's second exchange, added 3.50 percent, or 49.14 points, to 1,452.53 on turnover of 304.6 billion yuan.
Hopes for fresh help for the economy has fuelled a rally of about 20 percent in the Shanghai market since the middle of last month but Tuesday saw a huge sell-off as profit-taking set in.
"The weak inflation data sparkled hopes for more economic policy easing," Central China Securities strategist Zhang Gang told AFP.
"Investors are also betting on the reform and policy stimulation from the recent economic session would help boost market performance."
Environmental protection companies rose on hopes more supportive measures would speed up industry development.
In Shanghai, Tianjin Capital Environmental Protection Group surged by its 10 percent upper limit to 9.89 yuan while Zhejiang Feida Environmental Science & Technology Co also jumped 10 percent to 14.95 yuan.
Banks rebounded after Tuesday's plunge. Shanghai-listed bank giant Industrial and Commercial Bank of China gained 2.38 percent to 4.30 yuan while Shenzhen-listed Ping An Bank added 3.50 percent to 14.19 yuan.

US-based stock funds post $2.7 billion outflows in latest week: ICIS&P
(The benchmark S&P 500 stock…)
NEW YORK: Investors in US-based mutual funds pulled $2.7 billion out of stock funds in the week ended Dec. 3 on profit-taking in US stocks ahead of year-end, data from the Investment Company Institute showed on Wednesday.
Outflows from stock funds over the latest three weeks amounted to $6.9 billion, marking their worst three-week stretch since July, according to the data from ICI, a US mutual fund trade organization.
Withdrawals of $3 billion from funds that specialize in US stocks accounted for the total outflows from stock funds, ICI data show. Bond funds attracted just $174 million, marking their weakest demand in six weeks.
Funds that mainly invest in international stocks pulled in a meager $271 million, marking their weakest demand since mid-October, when the funds posted their only weekly outflows of 2014.
The benchmark S&P 500 stock index, which has risen over 11 per cent this year, rose 0.1 per cent over the reporting period.
"Coming into year-end, the market is up a lot, so I think there's some profit-taking going on," said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.
He said, however, that he remained bullish on US stocks and expected the S&P 500 to gain 6-10 per cent next year on stable US economic and corporate earnings growth.
Wren also said a plunge in energy shares over ICI's reporting period may have contributed to outflows from stock funds. The S&P energy index fell 3.2 per cent over the period after oil prices hit four-year lows.
Hybrid funds, which can invest in stocks and fixed income securities, posted $681 million in outflows. That marked their second straight week of investor withdrawals and their biggest outflows since the week ended Oct. 15.

Bharatpurs pride  painted storks  go missing  officials cant saywhySituated in Block D of the bird sanctuary, the painted storks’ colony has been in existence for at least 200 years.
New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 4:55 am
The world famous Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary in Rajasthan has lost its biggest draw — the painted stork. The hugely popular and colourful birds, whose colony inside the sanctuary is touted as one of the largest in Asia, flew away last month. Environmentalists and bird watchers have called it a huge tragedy, since the entire flock of 1,500-plus painted storks abandoned the colony in the middle of their breeding season — leaving behind hundreds of eggs which were later devoured by crows and other carrion birds.
The forest department of Bharatpur, though aware of the stinging loss to the world heritage site, is treading cautiously. “I came here only last month, so can’t really comment. But if you insist, I will get a report from my staff,’’ said Field Director Bijo Joy.
The Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests & Chief Wildlife Warden of Rajasthan, Sidhnath Singh, said he was informed about the mass departure, but the officials at Bharatpur could do precious little in the matter. Blaming the “insufficient monsoon’’, he emphasised that shortage of water seemed to be the only culprit. “Nobody can control the monsoon. 2014 was particularly bad, so the storks probably decided not to stay,’’ he said.
Singh may be technically correct, but there is another reason. By several accounts, the painted storks started leaving last month after the forest department allowed dozens of trucks and JCB machines inside the sanctuary. These were engaged to build mud platforms around the storks’ colony, so as to enable the visitors to click “better photographs’’ of the birds.
Also, mounds were created in the water bodies — ostensibly to give more perching space to the storks. But all this had an opposite effect: in Bharatpur, where the only modes of transport allowed are bicycles and cycle rickshaws, the onslaught of heavy machinery scared the storks, prompting them to take flight en masse.
Joy’s predecessor Khyati Mathur, who was the Field Director at the time the painted storks flew away, claimed that construction activities in and around the colony did not trigger their departure. “I am sure the birds have evolved to a degree that they accept a fairly high level of human activities. Aren’t the birds thriving at Okhla barrage, despite the commotion from nearby Delhi and Noida?’’ she replied to a query.
But bird conservation experts contested Mathur’s argument. “You do not construct mounds near trees where birds have already made their nest. They will definitely fly away,’’ said Dr K Sivakumar, senior scientist with Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) whose team members have been doing research in Bharatpur for the last 15 years.
Sivakumar said there was no possibility of the painted storks coming continued…

Ex-Madoff computer programmer gets 2-1/2 years prison for fraud5
The five employees are among 15 people who have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. Madoff is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading guilty in 2009 to running a scheme that cost investors an estimated $17 billion or more in principal.
Prosecutors said the five employees knowingly propped up Madoff's fraud by creating fake documents and backdating trades.
Prosecutors said Crupi, who managed accounts purporting to have a $900 million balance in 2008, helped generate fictitious trading data presented to firm clients.
Prosecutors had sought more than 14 years in prison for Crupi, who was convicted of securities, conspiracy and other charges with the other four employees.
But Swain imposed a more lenient term, as she did in sentencing the other employees, a trend a prosecutor last week said set a bad precedent.
Daniel Bonventre, Madoff's former back office director, was sentenced last Monday to the longest prison term, 10 years.
Annette Bongiorno, Madoff's former secretary and later a manager, received six years in prison, while computer programmers Jerome O'Hara and George Perez received 2-1/2 years in prison each.
Prosecutors sought more than 20 years for Bonventre and Bongiorno and more than eight for Perez and O'Hara.
The defendants, who are expected to appeal, have said Madoff deceived them into believing the business was legitimate.
Crupi told Swain on Monday that she had believed Madoff, who had discouraged her from learning about the securities industry.
"Knowing my work played a part in carrying out this horrible scheme will cause me shame and remorse for the rest of my life," Crupi said.

Sony Suffers Another Hit With Leak of Internal EmailsJolie and Sandler Bear Brunt of Latest Sony Email Leak
 
Dec 10, 2014 8:48pm
Entertainment and electronics company Sony has apparently suffered yet another leak of internal emails.
Emails reportedly hacked and leaked claimed to show a top producer criticizing Angelina Jolie’s talent and ego; employees bashing Adam Sandler’s movies; and a talent manager flattering Leonardo DiCaprio in an apparent attempt to try to woo him into playing a part in a major motion picture.
Could Seth Rogen and James Franco’s New Film Atart a War?
In a statement to ABC News today, Sony said it had an “enormously successful partnership” with Sandler and intended to be in business with him “forever.”
Sony also said, “We don’t know where those comments came from or who said them. We have Pixels, Hotel T, the Grown Ups franchise, Paul Blart and several TV series on the air. We are in no way backing off of our relationship with Adam Sandler, which is both creatively fertile and quite profitable for the studio.”

The leak comes after hackers leaked copies of films like “Annie” and Brad Pitt’s “Fury” in November.
“It’s truly a digital-era disaster,” said Brent Lang, a senior film and media reporter at Variety. “And it’s one that shows no signs of stopping.”
The FBI is still investigating who is behind the cyberwar and whether it could be North Korea’s retaliation for the upcoming Sony movie “ The Interview ” and its plot to assassinate Kim Jong Un.
Hackers calling themselves the Guardians of Peace also reportedly accessed directors and actors’ phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers and even aliases they’ve used to protect their privacy.
So far, Sony has been losing millions from pirated copies of the movies.
“Sony definitely can bounce back from this,” Lang said. “It’s going to take time. It’s not just going to take months. It may take years.”
“The Interview” is still slated to premiere in Los Angeles Thursday.

Fitch expects increased offshore issuances by Indian CorporatesFitch expects increased offshore issuances by Indian Corporates
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | December 10, 2014 12:27 IST
The growth is likely to be driven by the need to refinance debt and fund capex once the investment cycle restarts.
 
 
Fitch Ratings says it expects Indian corporates to increasingly access the offshore debt capital markets for their funding requirements. The growth is likely to be driven by the need to refinance debt and fund capex once the investment cycle restarts. The agency also expects the number of new issuers to rise with many corporates looking to diversify their funding sources
 
Fitch estimates offshore bond issuances by non-financial Indian corporates to have crossed US$13bn so far in 2014, compared with around USD9bn during the whole of 2013. Issuances by non-investment grade (rated lower than 'BBB-') corporates have increased significantly to over US$5bn in 2014 from US$3bn in 2013. The number of such corporates issuing bonds has also increased to over ten compared with four in 2013. During 2014, the majority of the bond issuances by the non-investment grade corporates have been for refinancing with only a few being used to fund expansion or overseas acquisitions.
 
The offshore capital markets are increasingly attractive to Indian corporates partly because of better pricing for their bonds. The offshore markets now present a relatively more cost-effective funding source compared with onshore funding for Indian corporates that have material cash inflows denominated in foreign currency. Pricing of offshore bonds has also been aided by a reduction of withholding tax on interest payments of offshore bonds to 5% from July 2014 compared with 20% previously. Investor demand for Indian bonds has also been strong due to expectations of improvement in Indian economic growth, improved political stability and strong liquidity in global capital markets.
 
A recent circular by the Reserve Bank of India may limit issuances by Indian corporates rated at the lower end of 'BB' category or lower, which typically pay higher interest rates. The circular limits the raising of debt by Indian corporates, either directly or indirectly, in the offshore markets at rates above the interest cap set out in the Foreign Exchange Management Act. The circular also imposes restrictions on Indian entities providing guarantees to their overseas subsidiaries or holding companies for raising offshore debt.
 
Fitch expects the number of new issuers tapping the offshore bond market to grow despite the above restrictions. The agency believes that with growing appetite for Indian bonds, sectors that traditionally have not accessed these markets may start to do so in 2015. Companies in the Indian real estate sector issued bonds for the first time in 2014.

Retail inflation likely fell to record low in Nov: Poll
Wholesale price inflation was forecast to slow to 1.41 percent in November from 1.77 percent in October, making a new five-year low.

Indian consumer inflation probably fell to a record low in November, dragged down by falling food and fuel prices, while growth in core industries nudged factory output up in October, a Reuters poll showed.
The latest survey of 36 economists forecast that retail inflation cooled to an annual rate of 4.50 percent from October's 5.52 percent.
That would make it the lowest since the government started releasing the data in 2012. Official retail inflation data will be released on Friday.
Wholesale price inflation was forecast to slow to 1.41 percent in November from 1.77 percent in October, making a new five-year low. The data will be released on Dec. 15.
"Continued steep declines in food and fuel prices, as well as subdued core pressures, mean that consumer price inflation is likely to have dropped to a record low in November," wrote Shilan Shah, Capital Economics' India economist, in a note.
While expecting some acceleration in inflation during coming months, partly due to the unwinding of a favourable base effect, the Reserve Bank of India raised hopes at a policy review last week that it would cut interest rates once it becomes more sure that inflationary pressures are waning.
The Reuters poll also forecast that production at India's factories, mines and utilities rose an annual 2.80 percent in October compared to 2.50 percent in September.
Data last week showed annual infrastructure output, which accounts for more than a third of overall factory production, accelerated to a four-month high of 6.3 percent in October.
The uptrend in industrial production will probably continue, according to a private survey earlier this month which showed strong demand meant factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in nearly two years in November.
The positive data suggests the economy may be gaining momentum after losing some steam in the July-September quarter.
"A recovery is certainly underway. Its sustainability depends critically on the continued efforts by the government to resolve the issues surrounding stalled projects," said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.

After a delay of almost seven years, the legislative approval to hike foreign direct investment in insurance sector from 26 percent to 49 percent may finally see the light of the day. A select committee of the Rajya Sabha headed by BJP leader Chandan Mitra tabled its report on Insurance Bill in the Upper House on Wednesday.
We bring you the key highlights of the draft Bill, which was approved by Congress, paving way for a long-pending economic reform. 
* The report, among other things, recommends a composite cap of 49 percent, which should include all foreign investment and foreign portfolio investment, including FDI, FPI and NRI components.
* Suggesting changes in definition of reinsurance, the draft seeks to define the term ‘control’ in Insurance Act and proposed power to IRDA in formulating norms subject to acts and rules.
* The committee is also of the view that incremental equity should “ideally” be used for expansion of capital base i.e to go from 26 percent to 40 percent there should be fresh capital infusion.

Street Signs
The select committee report on the insurance Bill, headed by Chandan Mitra, has been tabled in Rajya Sabha today. The draft report, among other things has recommended 49 percent composite FDI in insurance, suggested changes in definition of reinsurance, sought to define the term `control' in Insurance Act and proposed power to IRDA in formulating norms subject to acts and rules.
The panel has accepted suggestions to the draft insurance bill made by Opposition Congress.
Speaking about the bill to CNBC-TV18's Ekta Batra and Latha Venkatesh, Ashvin Parekh, Managing Partner of Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services says it is a long awaited and may go through if there aren't many dissents. He clarified that composite FDI includes FDI, FPI and NRI components as well. Former LIC chairman SB Mathur feels the bill, if it becomes a law in this session itself, will lead to many insurance companies becoming public by 2016.
Below is the transcript of Ashvin Parekh, SB Mathur and Sanjiv Bajaj\\'s interview with Anuj Singhal and Ekta Batra on CNBC-TV18.
Ekta: Finally that day has come, give us a sense in terms of what you expect this select panel to possibly throw up and when would you see the bill see the light of day?
Parekh: It is a long awaited bill now. The first draft was made in 2008 and then in 2014 we saw some more additions being made. Everything depends on the recommendations made by the committee and also the order of dessent. The larger parties in the Opposition have recommended that the amendment should have happened. If foreign investment in insurance sector is permitted to go up to 49 percent, then I suppose the order of dessent will decide. If we don’t have too much of dessent, then the Upper House may approve in which case it goes to the President for notification and it becomes an Act thereafter.
Ekta: There is that composite FDI which is now possibly going to be 49 percent according to select panel report. Your thoughts on it and what exactly does that composite 49 percent FDI entail?
Parekh: It is composite foreign investment. What it would therefore mean is, as I understand, that it will have FDI as well as the FII components. So what it will mean is that 49 percent is not hard cast, it is left to the shareholders. For instance, if a foreign shareholder decides to keep his investment up to 26 percent then he may allow the Indian company to offer the rest of its equity to the market which then can be picked up by the FII. So I am personally very glad. I must say that these are very welcome suggestions. The matter of how much of within that 49 percent is FDI, how much of it is FII is entirely left to the shareholders. Each shareholder agreement, the way it has been drawn, will now decide, will now discuss about the entire thing. What worries me, however, is the definition of the Indian management control. That is something that we may have to examine the fine print basically.
Ekta: When you say definition of Indian management control and defining it in the fine print, what do you mean, what would be the cause for concern there?
Parekh: The whole question is the class of equity that either the FIIs or the foreign investors will get. For instance, if we restrict the voting rights, that is a second class of equity that is required to be offered to the foreign investors then I suppose it would not be a complete reform. The valuation itself will suffer because equity with voting rights and equity without voting rights are two different things altogether. So that is one observation I am making.
The second observation is it shouldn’t become a hindrance. So far we have seen that after almost about 58-59 partnerships that have happened, the foreign partners have worked very closely with the Indian partners, we haven’t had any dispute or any major issue in regards of the shareholder understanding. This creating a new class of equity could be a bit problematic. So I would say if Indian management control only keeps itself to 51 percent of equity, which the Indian shareholders put together could own then it is fine. Then the definition is a very workable definition.
Ekta: Coming back to composite FDI, I just wanted to get a sense, would it then mean that a couple of these insurance companies which are now subsidiaries of bigger companies would have to be hived off in order for them to take advantage?
Parekh: That is going to be only one of the implications. I don’t think that is too much of an implication because all these investments made by the parent companies, in many cases it is conglomorates and also banking companies. These are investments, these are not subsidiary organisations as yet -- these are subsidiary organisations but in the books of banks, these are investments basically in the form of shares held in these entities. So I would say that by virtue of being a shareholder of a JV company, the person does not automatically become the shareholder of the bank. So I am not too much worried about the structure part but I am certainly concerned about the composite limit to the extent that if it was entirely FDI, which was the original reform, fortunately they have now changed it to composite limit. So in that regard, I would say it is a very welcome move. What will happen is if he had said that it was only going to be permissible by way of FDI that it would have created a deadlock situation. One shareholder has 49 percent the other shareholder has 51 percent, nobody will take the equity to the market unless both of them jointly agree to take it to the market.
Latha: Do you expect in the next 18 months, somebody will come to the market?
Parekh: This will certainly pave way for the Indian promoters. If I look at the life insurance sector particularly where huge amount of capital is required, I am seeing that at least four-five companies are almost ready to take the equity to the market. Their performance do show that they have started making profits and then there is no need for additional capital in these cases, so they can take it to the market. So I am certainly seeing that. Your point on price discoveries are very valid one. If let us say out of these first four-five, all of them have done extremely well in the last 12 years, they have built a good portfolio, a good life fund, they go to the market then we may get certain order of price and then it creates a market. It creates the market for the others also to follow in that particular area.
Latha: It now looks like when the Select Committee tabling its report in parliament it is only a matter of days before the cabinet approves it and tables the bill itself could happen in this session or most likely the bill becomes law in this session itself. How do you see the contents that are known so far?
Mathur: I feel it is a welcome step. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) if being raised to 49 percent would not have driven the valuation so much. We have seen in the said capital market it is the Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) who drive the valuation and to that extent Indian promoters should be thankful that the FII will be there to give them a good value for money, they have been kept invested for more than 10 years now. So, they will get good valuations.
Number two I see it more as restoring the credibility of the country as a whole. We have been talking for the last 14 years even before this sector was opened up that it will be taken to 49. Successive governments have made this declaration and it is kind of we were losing acceptance that everybody is saying it should be 49 and they have not been able to do it. So to that extent I see it as a welcome measure.
Secondly the other thing of the insurance bill which are very critical, one of them is section 45 which gives the insurer right to repudiate a policy in case a violation of claim. They were tinkering it, within Rajya Sabha presentations were made to the select committee that you are curbing policyholder’s rights and unnecessarily exposing them to risk, denial of a claim. So, it should not be done or it should be modified. I would love to see what the committee has recommended on that.
So that is very critical because they were raising the period from two years i.e. the policy, if it is taken today if early claim happens within two years and there is deliberate non-disclosure the claim could be repudiated. Now the amended bill suggested that this period to be raised to three years instead of two years. So, instead of two years policy holders could repudiate up to three years and they had also included cases of involuntary nondisclosure i.e. I am not aware, I have made a wrong statement or I have conceded a fact which is not done deliberately. Even those cases are now covered which is a very dangerous trend because death claim settlement has to be very customer friendly.
Latha: It looks sure shot that the winter session is going to see the passage of insurance bill. How do things change for you? In the next 18 months do we see you come to the market?
A: Finally we are seeing light at the end of what was a very long tunnel but yes, I am hopeful now that this bill does get passed. We don’t as Bajaj Allianz need to go to the market. We have been building this business very gradually and profitably. So, we are adequately capitalised, but there will be many other companies that are in urgent need of capital and this bill once it becomes an act should end up benefitting them as well.

Swiss brokerage Credit Suisse today said the robust foreign inflows into the country's debt and equities markets will halve to USD 18-20 billion next year on a slowdown in the sovereign wealth funds' (SWFs) play.
"The FII (foreign institutional investors) inflows into the domestic markets will come down to USD 18-20 billion in the next 12 months, which is half of the current inflows," managing director for equity research Neelkanth Mishra told reporters here.
He attributed this primarily to a possible slowdown in pumping in money by the SWFs.
SWFs are short on allocatable resources due to the fall in the crude oil prices, Mishra said. FIIs hold as much as 27 percent in the over USD 1.6 trillion Sensex market capitalisation as of the September quarter, which is at a historic high.
Currently, the inflows are almost evenly split between debt and equities, (as there is a USD 25 billion cap on FIIs' holdings in government bonds, though there is a huge demand for more) and Mishra pointed to his in-house research which said around 40-50 per cent of the inflows into domestic equities come from SWFs.
It can be noted that oil prices have slid to a five-year low of USD 66-67 to a barrel. Since June, there has been a massive 35 percent fall in the Indian basket of Brent crude.
Many of the countries in the Middle East like the UAE and Oman have very active SWFs.
Even though the policy-makers sometimes blame such flows to be "fickle", the FII inflows are important for funding the current account gap and reducing the overall deficit, which surged up to 2.1 percent in the second quarter as against 1.2 percent a year-ago.

Hindutva agenda: Oppn targets Narendra Modi govt over forced re-conversionsLeh, Kargil record season's coldest night, Srinagar at -5.4 C
Opposition parties today hit out at the PM Narendra Modi government over the issue of alleged forced re-conversions in Agra and accused it of following the Hindutva agenda, a charge rejected by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ministers.
Condemning the Sangh Parivar activities, former Union minister and senior Congress leader Veerappa Moily said it was “anti- national” and demanded the intervention of the Prime Minister in the issue.
“The central and state governments must take these issues very seriously… Prime Minister should step into such cases… Give some statement possibly in Parliament,” he said.

Moily’s party colleague and former Minister of State for Minority Affairs Ninong Ering said he had tried to raise the issue, but was not allowed to do so.
“I got up several times to raise the issue, but was not allowed to speak on it. It is the prerogative of the Speaker to allow people to speak.
“If conversions happen willingly then it’s fine, but if people are lured with any kind of promises, then it sends a wrong message,” Ering said.

Expressing shock over the matter, CPI’s D Raja alleged that attempts are being made to impose the Hindutva agenda on everybody.
“It’s a conscious attempt to impose the Hindutva agenda on everybody… The state government should take serious note and the (Union) Home Ministry must take serious note of this and they must act accordingly to uphold the basic values of the Constitution,” he said.
CPI-M leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sitaram Yechury said the re-conversions were a ploy to vitiate the environment before Christmas.
“This is clearly a ploy, a scheme, being worked out before Christmas. This is the dirtiest of vote-bank politics being played by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the BJP.
“The RSS chief has gone on record to say that for the first time they have got control of the central government (and) so, will pursue their agenda of transforming the secular, democratic Indian republic into their version of a rabidly intolerant fascist nation. And that is what you see in practice,” Yechury said.
At least 100 persons from 37 families were reportedly re-converted to Hinduism at a ceremony organised by an offshoot of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in the cantonment area of Agra on Dec. 8.
The Dharma Jagran cell of RSS and Bajrang Dal claimed to have jointly organised the event where about 100 people, mostly slum dwellers, were re-converted and “brought back to the Hindu fold”.
Meanwhile, saying that the ruling BJP should not vitiate the atmosphere in the country in the name of re-conversion, AAP today led a delegation of its MPs to Home Minister Rajnath Singh.
But BJP ministers dismissed any allegations about the re- conversions having been carried out forcibly, saying that the people had come forward voluntarily for the exercise in Agra.
“Those who are making allegations, I think they are doing so because it is their habit… Those who have converted, have done so voluntarily. No one can be forced to change their religion. So, it is not proper to target a particular organisation by making such allegations,” said Union Minister Kalraj Mishra.
His Cabinet colleague, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, echoed those views, saying, “If some people have done so (re-converted) voluntarily, then it is their right. If there is any coercion, the local administration will see about that. As far as the opposition is concerned, they always want some issue.”
BJP leader Vinay Katiyar said that the consent of the participants was obtained before their re-conversion.
“We don’t do anything forcibly. We do it with consent,” Katiyar said. Asked whether the re-conversion was done after luring people with rations, he said, “The matter will be investigated.”

The government today allowed public sector banks to raise up to Rs 1.60 lakh crore from markets by diluting government holding to 52 percent in phases so as to meet Basel III capital adequacy norms.
"The quantum of capital support needed by banks is huge, which cannot be funded by budgetary support alone," an official statement said, detailing the decision taken by the Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to allow PSBs to raise equity capital from market.
The Cabinet asked the PSBs to broadbase retail shareholding while going in for the fund raising.
Out of 27 PSBs, Government of India controls 22 through majority holding. In the remaining 5 banks, state-run SBI holds majority stake. "If the PSBs are permitted to bring down Government holding to 52 percent in a phased manner, they can raise up to Rs 1,60,825 crore from the market," it said.
The Basel III norms, which will come into effect from March 31, 2019, were put in place following the 2007-08 financial crisis triggered by the fall of Lehman Brothers.
The norms are aimed at improving risk management and governance while raising the banking sector's ability to absorb financial and economic stress. As per Basel-Ill norms, the minimum Tier-1 has to be 7 percent.
The total support provided to PSBs towards capitalisation during the past four years was Rs 58,634 crore, the statement said, adding the provision for the current year is at Rs 11,200 crore.
The total market cap of Government shareholding as on May 2014, stands at over Rs 4.19 lakh crore.
There are over two dozen PSBs and government holding in them is between 56.26 percent to 88.63 percent.
Public sector banks require equity capital of Rs 2.4 lakh crore by 2018 to meet Basel III norms.
GoI budgetary support needed for 2015-19 would be Rs 78,895 crore, which will maintain government holding at 52 percent, the statement said. However, as Government is likely to receive an amount of Rs 34,500 crore from PSBs as dividend , the net outgo will only be Rs 44,395 crore, it added.
"Going by past trends if we take average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate for the next five years as 6.5 percent and dividend pay-out ratio as 20 percent as percentage of net profit or 0.80 of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and credit growth rate at 18 percent and further RWAs growth at 16 percent, the total capital would be over Rs 4.60 lakh crore," the statement said.

Small energy companies hit hardPleasure at the pump pounds these companies

Cheap gas! What’s not to love? Don’t tell that to a group energy companies suffering a crash that’s reaching a historic level to the magnitude of the dot-com crash and Great Recession.
Plunging oil prices are clearly bad for most energy companies. But small energy companies are taking it especially hard. The S&P SmallCap 600 energy sector is now down 50.5% from its close at the end of June 2014, says Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Such a vicious decline ranks right up there with some of the most ugly market crashes of all time. The Nasdaq Composite, for instance, lost nearly 80% of its value from peak to trough between 2000 and 2002.
Some small energy stocks are already suffering dot-com style beatdowns. Basic Energy Services (BAS) , an oil and natural gas driller, is down 81% from its closing price on June 30, 2014. That’s just plain ugly.
And don’t forget Comstock Resources (CRK) , which is down a crushing 80% from its closing price on June 30. The Texas-based company is an oil explorer.
Some worry that the decline in oil prices will hit some of these small players so hard that it could start to make a serious dent in the market’s overall earnings. During the third quarter, the energy sector generated $11.97 per share of the S&P 500’s total earnings of $30.03, says S&P Capital IQ. That huge piece of earnings is in possible jeopardy if energy prices stay low.

NEW YORK: US stocks extended their declines in afternoon trading on Wednesday as the energy sector resumed its recent slide along with oil prices.
The S&P energy index was down 3.3 per cent, the worst performing S&P sector and on track for its fourth drop in five sessions. Brent crude touched a new five-year low of $63.56 on signs of oversupply and soft demand.
Exxon Mobil, down 3.2 per cent, led declines on the S&P 500.
Falling oil prices have raised concerns about earnings for energy companies, with year-end tax selling putting additional pressure on the group. The sector, down more than 15 per cent for the year so far, is the worst performing of the 10 major S&P sectors for the year.
"Oil seems to be the one theme that has more control over the direction of the market and the degree that volatility emerges than any other theme right now," said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.
Shares of Yum Brands Inc dropped 4.9 per cent a day after it lowered its profit forecast for the year for the second time, hurt by slower-than-expected sales recovery in China following a food safety scare in July.
At 1:43 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 169.64 points, or 0.95 per cent, to 17,631.56, the S&P 500 lost 17.52 points, or 0.85 per cent, to 2,042.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 32.99 points, or 0.69 per cent, to 4,733.48.
Among the day's gainers were airline shares, including Southwest Airlines, up 4.4 per cent and was leading gains on the S&P 500. Barclays said airlines stand to see a decline of about $10 billion in fuel costs in 2015.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,343 to 701, for a 3.34-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,904 issues fell and 743 advanced for a 2.56-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 was posting 32 new 52-week highs and 24 lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 84 new highs and 67 lows.

Oil traders buy $100 options  betting on a rebound - eventuallyMobius Risk Group
(Some argue that it is an opportune…)
NEW YORK: Oil traders have been quietly buying cheap, far out-of-the-money call options at $100 a barrel, betting that the biggest sell-off since the financial crisis has gone too far and that crude is likely to rebound by this time next year.
Open interest in US crude oil $100 calls for December 2015 has jumped 13 per cent in the last two weeks to nearly 37,000 on Wednesday, with a premium of around 40 cents.
For the December 2016 $100 calls, open interest has surged by more than 50 per cent to nearly 16,000, with a premium of around $1.00, according to exchange data.
With US crude oil futures for January hovering at just above $60 a barrel, down from nearly $108 a barrel in June, traders aren't likely counting on those options to expire in the money but rather betting that their value will increase provided oil prices bottom out or begin to creep up next year.
"People don't trade options because they think the price will necessarily get there. They're looking for relatively good value," said John Saucer, vice president of research and analytics at Mobius Risk Group in Houston.
"The question is: How do you get the most bang for your buck?" he said.
Since the summer, oversupplied global markets coupled with lackluster demand kicked off a sell-off in both the US crude and Brent contracts. The sell-off accelerated following the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) meeting in Vienna last month, when member countries decided not to cut production amid speculation of a price war.
The motivations for investors to have so many open contracts in those two months at $100 are not immediately clear. High levels of activity in December are not a surprise as it is among the most liquid months of the year for hedging.
Yet, some argue that it is an opportune moment to buy as falling prices have increased the put skew - the difference in implied volatility for out-of-the-money and in-the-money options - allowing more upside potential to the call side.
"There are too many guys on the short side now," said one trader.

Investing.com - Investing.com - The dollar edged lower against most major currencies on Wednesday after investors flocked to the yen on concerns China's economy may grow less than expected going forward, though losses were seen as short-lived on concerns the European crisis may return.
In U.S. trading on Wednesday, EUR/USD was up 0.55% at 1.2441.
The yen rose on jitters over the outlook for China's economy after Beijing set new restrictions on collateral for short-term loans.
The move fueled fears that the China may grow less than anticipated, which fueled safe-haven yen positions that came at the greenback's expense.
The yen often rises when Japanese stocks fall and growth-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars slide, and the yen's advance brought the euro and others up with it on Wednesday.
Still, the dollar's losses were seen as limited due to a surprise decision by the Greek government to bring forward a parliamentary vote for president to next week from February.
Markets were spooked by the risk of snap elections, which could take place if Prime Minister Antonis Samaras's candidate is not approved by parliament, which could see the anti-bailout Syriza party take power.
Still, the euro held onto its gains as investors continued to sell the greenback for profits and await fresh U.S. data.
Last week's strong U.S. jobs report for November prompted investors to bring forward expectations for the first hike in interest rates to mid-2015 from September 2015 ahead of the data.
The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 321,000 jobs in November, well past expectations for a 225,000 reading.
Investors were looking ahead to next week's policy statement from the Fed amid speculation that policymakers could drop an assurance that interest rates will stay low for a "considerable time."
The dollar was down against the yen, with USD/JPY down 1.38% at 118.02, and down against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF down 0.45% at 0.9670.
The greenback was down against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.27% at 1.5711.
The dollar was mixed against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with USD/CAD up 0.30% at 1.1479, AUD/USD up 0.25% at 0.8315 and NZD/USD up 1.78% at 0.7815.
The US dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.54% at 88.26.
On Thursday, the U.S. is to release data on retail sales, the government measure of consumer spending, as well as the weekly report on jobless claims.

Blog: Modi government s doing fine  problem s with India IncDecember 11, 2014, 7:14 am IST Economic Times in ET Commentary | India | ET
40
‘Sarkaar sabka mai baap hai!Â Whenever there is a problem, everybody goes to them for help!’ The head of a large finance house who made this succinct analysis many years ago could not have anticipated the current situation where a mollycoddled industry is blaming a newly-installed government for the lack of decisive leadership. He could have well added that India Inc is not averse to knee-jerk criticism of the government when things go wrong.
According to ET on Wednesday (goo.gl/pyT0TW), India Inc is concerned about the government’s alleged slow-motion reforms programme and its inability to kickstart the investment cycle.
Sanjay Reddy, GVK Power & Infra vice chairman, is believed to have said that hope is waning after the initial euphoria. SRF chairman Arun Bharat reportedly referred to the government’s dithering on labour reforms and pointed a finger at the stalling tactics of the BJP’s labour union.
The ET report added that many industrialists are concerned about the lack of boldness in reforms and absence of radical ideas, though some have, like Sunil Bharti Mittal, supported the government and called for patience.
The fact that such concerns are coming out a week after the ET Awards where CEOs fell over each trying to laud the government’s bold, decisive leadership is a surprise. One is also unsure if these expressions are part of the usual drumbeats of crisis that precede annual budgetary exercises. Raise the tempo, warn of missed opportunities and fading dreams, in the hope that the government will respond with a planeload of goodies come Budget-time.
So is any of this true? Or is India Inc being petulant and unreasonable?
The facts point to the latter. Since taking charge, the Modi government has moved to cut red tape, shrink approvals required to set up businesses, remove unnecessary environmental regulations that had held up projects and promote aggressively India’s investment climate. All this has been accompanied by faster decision-making.
Diesel has been deregulated and the first attempts to let in private sector investment in commercial coal mining have been proposed. In a few days from now, foreign investment in insurance companies will be increased to 49% and a Bill to dramatically alter the nature of indirect taxes will be presented in Parliament.
A CEO of an industrial house told me that his application to set up a factory in Maharashtra was cleared in just 20 days. State governments, especially those ruled by the BJP, have been more pro-active, enacting labour reforms and pushing through key decisions quickly.
A Crisil study released on Tuesday showed an unprecedented pickup in execution of road projects. It notes how work has already begun on 75% of the projects awarded in 2013-14 and that in some cases, there’s been progress of as much as 40-50%. Such momentum, according to the study, is unparalleled.
Would India Inc prefer government to continue to subsidise diesel and LPG? Would it want FDI in insurance to remain capped at 26%? Many industrialists have openly praised these initiatives. Thus, more the surprise to see the CII National Council not take cognisance of these developments.
Dhruv Sawhney of Triveni has reportedly said that the capital goods sector has suffered and that investment is not taking place. Sawhney should know better.
Judicial interventions in coal and iron ore mining, the indecisiveness of the UPA in gas pricing and corporate excesses in metals and capital goods have created a mess that will take many years to clear. He is right about the problem, but the reason is not government apathy.
Supreme Court orders have practically shut down iron ore mining in India. During the boom years, metal companies created so much excess capacity in steel that it is difficult to envisage any promoter contemplating a steel plant now. Many infrastructure and power companies are saddled with debt and unable to raise equity despite a roaring stock market. This is because investors don’t trust the sector to deliver and believe that the companies are over-leveraged.
Corporate excess in some sectors and an overseas acquisition binge that has destroyed so much shareholder value are responsible for the slowdown. India Inc knows this well. But it would rather shift the blame to someone else.

No point cutting rates till inflation cools: Credit Suisse | Rajan under pressure by MPsAbu Dhabi
(Credit Suisse's Neelkanth…)
Neelkanth Mishra, MD and India Strategist at Credit Suisse said a decline in crude oil prices and drop in current account surpluses in many oil exporting countries means that India will see slower fund flows going ahead. In an interview with ET's R Sriram & Biswajit Baruah, he said the RBI should look at inflationary expectations and till inflationary expectations don't come down there is no point cutting interest rates. Edited excerpts:
There has been a constant flow of good news recently including slide in oil prices, chances of fiscal deficit coming down, diesel price deregulation and so on. How do you read these headlines?
If you look at the decline in crude oil prices there are three implications — one is on the balance of payment, second is on the inflation, and third is on the fiscal numbers. Starting with the balance of payment the rule of thumb is $1 per barrel change in oil price affects the current account deficit (CAD) by about $1 billion a year. Thus, if there is a $20 decline in oil prices then there is a $20-billion impact on the current account deficit. As there is weak demand, it will hurt India's exports as well.
Further, capital flows get impacted, too — if you look at the sources of funds that invest in India, it's primarily the sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), the pension funds and the insurance funds. If Norway, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, or Kuwait are not going to see the kind of surpluses that they used to then they will have less capital to send out, which will mean that capital flows into India will not be as strong as they were. Thus, I do not think oil price fall will boost the currency or balance of payment situation.
Is there a possibility that inflation may bounce back early next year and hence interest rates are unlikely to come down in the near term?
My sense is that once the base effect is gone by December, we could see inflation rise again; this may not be to double digits or high single digits levels but to levels which will be more in line with the glide path that the RBI has given. The RBI should look at inflationary expectations and till inflationary expectations don't come down there is no point cutting interest rates because that has to be the target. And, for inflationary expectations to come down one should see sustained lower inflation for several months.
What are the prospects of investments picking up in the economy?
We see there are areas where investment growth will happen. It goes without saying that we need to invest more in water treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, metro rails, and so on. There is always some capex that's going on, but if you are looking from the perspective of what can really drive GDP growth then you have to look at the whole basket, and unfortunately that part is not moving.
The whole basket will not move till you have power, metal, rail and road capex starting to come through. These are the four massive chunks of our investment basket. And for the needle to really start moving at the economy level you need to have maybe 100 cities doing investments at the same time. That seems hard right now.
  Are Indian market valuations comparable to emerging markets index or BRIC Index?
If you look at India's price-to-earnings the most common push-back is whether India is cheap or expensive. MSCI India price-toearnings in comparison to MSCI Emerging Markets price-to-earnings is at a multiyear high, or that India versus Asia price to earnings is at four year high. But how is that really relevant?
If emerging markets' biggest weights Brazil, Mexico, Russia, China, and Korea are seeing problems, with each market having its own idiosyncrasy and growth suppressor how is that even comparable to India? So, I use MSCI World Index to compare with MSCI India and on that the price-to-earnings comparison has barely moved, because the move in Indian equity markets is more a reflection of global preference for equities. People say India is the best among BRICS, but that's no comparison at all.
FII flows have been at $17 billion this year, compared to a run rate of over $20 billion for the last two years. What is your outlook on global flows into India?
Thefall in oil prices and decline in current account surpluses in many oil exporting countries means that India will see slower flows. We may see a market-share gain in flows versus other economies. If you look at the eventual sources of funds — pension funds, insurance funds, sovereign wealth funds — I think most of them are under-invested in India. So, some amount of flows will keep happening but not at the quantum that we are used to.
What are your top picks in the current state of the economy right now?
If you are looking from a 12-month perspective, we are advising three 'buy' baskets and this is something we have been doing for a while now — one is wholesalefunded financials with good asset franchises, because as wholesale funding rates keep coming down companies that have a reasonable asset franchise will grow their earning profitably, and we are already seeing signs of that.
The second theme is exports and what we are saying is that with 45% reduction in value of the currency since 2011, there are opportunities in import substitution and exports. And on the services side we like IT, we still like pharma, and may be even two-wheelers.

(Jet shares have soared 80%…)
MUMBAI: Jet Airways has been among the top performers on Dalal Street in the last two weeks as savvy investors bought the share amid troubles at rival Spicejet and due to declining fuel prices.
Jet shares have soared 80% since November 25, outpacing the BSE 500 index, on hopes the company would benefit from the recent mass flight cancellations by SpiceJet.
The BSE 500 index gained only marginally in the period. "Investors are reallocating their funds from SpiceJet to Jet Airways, while new investors are also buying the stock because it's the only airline company available in the listed space besides SpiceJet," said Mehraboon Irani, principal & head — private client group business at Nirmal Bang Securities.
SpiceJet shares have fallen 24% since December 1 when the troubles at the company erupted.
Analysts said lower aviation fuel prices, along with the fall in crude oil prices, would help Jet Airways improve its margins. Aviation fuel costs were around 38% of revenues for the half-year ended September.
"The fundamental factor for the share price to jump is the significant decline in crude prices, which are down 40% from peak," said Avinnash Gorakssakar, head of research at Miintdirect.com.
"In the short-term, as long as crude prices remain soft, the next couple of quarters will be much better in terms of EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation) margins."
Brent crude oil prices fell over 42% since June to a five-and-ahalf year low of around $66 a barrel on Tuesday.
Analysts and fund managers, however, warn a re-rating of the company is still some time away.
Jet Airways' revenues stood at Rs 17,301 crore for FY14, while losses were at Rs 3,667 crore. The company consolidated debt was Rs 10,577 crore as on March 31.
"We are not comfortable with airline companies as they have high debt on their balance sheets.
The sector is expected to benefit from lower crude prices but profitability of airlines still remains a big worry," said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer -equities at Kotak Mutual Fund .

CIA interrogation report[View timeline: The CIA’s use of enhanced interrogation]
The report’s central conclusion is that harsh interrogation measures, deemed torture by program critics including President Obama, did not work. The panel deconstructs prominent claims about the value of the “enhanced” measures, including that they produced breakthrough intelligence in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, and dismisses them all as exaggerated if not utterly false — assertions that the CIA and former officers involved in the program vehemently dispute .
In a statement from the White House, Obama said the Senate report “documents a troubling program” and “reinforces my long-held view that these harsh methods were not only inconsistent with our values as [a] nation, they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests.” Obama praised the CIA’s work to degrade al-Qaeda over the past 13 years but said the agency’s interrogation program “did significant damage to America’s standing in the world and made it harder to pursue our interests with allies and partners.”
The CIA issued a 112-page response to the Senate report, acknowledging failings in the interrogation program but denying that it intentionally misled the public or policymakers about an effort that it maintains delivered critical intelligence.
“The intelligence gained from the program was critical to our understanding of al-Qa’ida and continues to inform our counterterrorism efforts to this day,” CIA Director John Brennan, who was a senior officer at the agency when it set up secret prisons for al-Qaeda suspects, said in a written statement. The program “did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists, and save lives,” he said.
The release of the report comes at an unnerving time in the country’s conflict with al-Qaeda and its offshoots. The Islamic State has beheaded three Americans in recent months and seized control of territory across Iraq and Syria. Fears that the report could ignite new overseas violence against American interests prompted Secretary of State John F. Kerry to appeal to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the chairman of the Senate committee, to consider a delay. The report has also been at the center of intense bureaucratic and political fights that erupted this year in accusations that the CIA surreptitiously monitored the computers used by committee aides involved in the investigation.
Many of the most haunting sections of the Senate document are passages taken from internal CIA memos and e-mails as agency employees described their visceral reactions to searing interrogation scenes. At one point in 2002, CIA employees at a secret site in Thailand broke down emotionally after witnessing the harrowing treatment of Abu Zubaida, a high-profile facilitator for ­al-Qaeda.
Almost 13 years after the CIA established secret prisons to hold and interrogate detainees, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report on the CIA’s programs. The report lists 20 key findings. View Graphic
Almost 13 years after the CIA established secret prisons to hold and interrogate detainees, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report on the CIA’s programs. The report lists 20 key findings.
“Several on the team profoundly affected,” one agency employee wrote at the time, “. . . some to the point of tears and choking up.” The passage is contrasted with closed-door testimony from high-ranking CIA officials, including then-CIA Director Michael V. Hayden, who when asked by a senator in 2007 whether agency personnel had expressed reservations replied: “I’m not aware of any. These guys are more experienced. No.”
The investigation was conducted exclusively by the Senate committee’s Democratic staff. Its release Tuesday is certain to stir new debate over a program that has been a source of contention since the first details about the CIA’s secret prison network began to surface publicly a decade ago . Even so, the report is unlikely to lead to new sanctions or structural change.
The document names only a handful of high-ranking CIA employees and does not call for any further investigation of those involved or even offer any formal recommendations. It steers clear of scrutinizing the involvement of the White House and Justice Department, which two years ago ruled out the possibility that CIA employees would face prosecution.
Instead, the Senate text is largely aimed at shaping how the interrogation program will be regarded by history. The inquiry was driven by Feinstein and her frequently stated determination to foreclose any prospect that the United States might contemplate such tactics again. Rather than argue their morality, Feinstein set out to prove that they did not work.
In her foreword to the report, Feinstein does not characterize the CIA’s actions as torture but says the trauma of 9/11 led the agency to employ “brutal interrogation techniques in violation of U.S. law, treaty obligations, and our values.” The report should serve as “a warning for the future,” she says.
“We cannot again allow history to be forgotten and grievous past mistakes to be repeated,” Feinstein says.
The reaction to the report, however, only reinforced how polarizing the CIA program remains more than five years after it was ordered dismantled by Obama.
Over the past year, the CIA assembled a lengthy and detailed rebuttal to the committee’s findings that argues that all but a few of the panel’s conclusions are unfounded. Hayden and other agency veterans have for months been planning a similarly aggressive response.
The report also faced criticism from Republicans on the Intelligence Committee who submitted a response to the report that cited alleged inaccuracies and faulted the committee’s decision to base its findings exclusively on CIA documents without interviewing any of the operatives involved. Democrats have said they did so to avoid interfering with a separate Justice Department inquiry.
The program’s start
At its height, the CIA program included secret prisons in countries including Afghanistan, Thailand, Romania, Lithuania and Poland — locations that are referred to only by color-themed codes in the report, such as “COBALT,” to preserve a veneer of secrecy.
The establishment of the “black sites” was part of a broader transformation of the CIA in which it rapidly morphed from an agency focused on intelligence-gathering into a paramilitary force with new powers to capture prisoners, disrupt plots, and assemble a fleet of armed drones to carry out targeted killings of al-Qaeda militants.
The report reveals the often haphazard ways in which the agency assumed these new roles. Within days of the 9/11 attacks, for example, President George W. Bush had signed a secret memorandum giving the CIA new authority to “undertake operations designed to capture and detain persons who pose a continuing, serious threat of violence or death to U.S. persons and interests.”
But the memo made no reference to interrogations, providing no explicit authority for what would become an elaborately drawn list of measures — including sleep deprivation, slams against cell walls and simulated drowning — to get detainees to talk. The Bush memo was a murky point of origin for a program that is portrayed throughout the Senate report as chaotically mismanaged.
One of the most lengthy sections describes the interrogation of the CIA’s first prisoner, Abu Zubaida, who was detained in Pakistan in March 2002. Abu Zubaida, badly injured when he was captured, was largely cooperative when jointly questioned by the CIA and FBI but was then subjected to confusing and increasingly violent interrogation as the agency assumed control.
After being transferred to a site in Thailand, Abu Zubaida was placed in isolation for 47 days, a period during which the presumably important source on al-Qaeda faced no questions. Then, at 11:50 a.m. on Aug. 4, 2002, the CIA launched a round-the-clock interrogation assault — slamming him against walls, stuffing him into a coffin-size box and waterboarding him until he coughed, vomited, and had “involuntary spasms of the torso and extremities.”
The treatment continued for 17 days. At one point, the waterboarding left Abu Zubaida “completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.” CIA memos described employees who were distraught and concerned about the legality of what they had witnessed. One said that “two, perhaps three” were “likely to elect transfer.”
The Senate report suggests top CIA officials at headquarters had little sympathy. When a cable from Thailand warned that the Abu Zubaida interrogation was “approach[ing] the legal limit,” Jose Rodriguez, then chief of the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center, cautioned subordinates to refrain from such “speculative language as to the legality” of the interrogation. “Such language is not helpful.”
Through a spokesman, Rodriguez told The Washington Post that he never instructed employees not to send cables about the legality of interrogations.
Abu Zubaida, also known as Zayn al-Abidin Muhammed Hussein, was waterboarded 83 times and kept in cramped boxes for nearly 300 hours. In October 2002, Bush was informed in his daily intelligence briefing that Abu Zubaida was still withholding “significant threat information,” despite views from the black site that he had been truthful from the outset and was “compliant and cooperative,” the report said.
The document provides a similarly detailed account of the interrogation of the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who fed his interrogators a stream of falsehoods and intelligence fragments. Waterboarding was supposed to simulate suffocation with a damp cloth and a trickle of liquid. But with Mohammed, CIA operatives used their hands to form a standing pool of water over his mouth. KSM, as he is known in agency documents, was ingesting “a LOT of water,” a CIA medical officer wrote, saying that the application had been so altered that “we are basically doing a series of near drownings.”
The CIA has maintained that only three prisoners were subjected to waterboarding, but the report alludes to evidence that it may have been used on others, including photographs of a well-worn waterboard at a black site where its use was never officially recorded. The committee said the agency could not explain the presence of the board and water-dousing equipment at the site, which is not named in the report but is believed to be the “Salt Pit” in Afghanistan.
There are also references to other procedures, including the use of tubes to administer “rectal rehydration” and feeding. CIA documents describe a case in which a prisoner’s lunch tray “consisting of hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts, and raisins was ‘pureed’ and rectally infused.” At least five CIA detainees were subjected to “rectal rehydration” or rectal feeding without documented medical necessity.
At times, senior CIA operatives voiced deep misgivings. In early 2003, a CIA officer in the interrogation program described it as a “train [wreck] waiting to happen” and that “I intend to get the hell off the train before it happens.” The officer, identified by former colleagues as Charlie Wise, subsequently retired and died in 2003. He had been picked for the job despite being reprimanded for his role in other troubled interrogation efforts in the 1980s in Beirut, former officials said.
The agency’s records of the program were so riddled with errors, according to the report, that the CIA often offered conflicting counts of how many prisoners it had.
In 2007, then-CIA Director Hayden testified in a closed-door session with the Senate panel that “in the history of the program, we’ve had 97 detainees.” In reality, the number was 119, according to the report, including 39 who had been subjected to harsh interrogation methods.
Two years later, when Hayden was preparing to deliver an early intelligence briefing for senior aides to newly elected President Obama, a subordinate noted that the actual count was significantly higher. Hayden “instructed me to keep the detainee number at 98,” the employee wrote to himself in an e-mail, “pick whatever date i needed to make that happen but the number is 98.”
Hayden comes under particularly pointed scrutiny in the report, which includes a 38-page table comparing his statements to often conflicting agency documents. The section is listed as an “example of inaccurate CIA testimony.”
In an e-mail to The Post, Hayden said the discrepancy in the prisoner numbers reflected the fact that detainees captured before the start of the interrogation program were counted separately from those held at the black sites. “This is a question of booking, not a question of deception,” Hayden said. He also said he directed the analyst who had called the discrepancy to his attention to confirm the revised accounting and then inform the incoming CIA director, Leon E. Panetta, that there was a new number and that the figure should be corrected with Congress.
Hayden said he would have explained this to the committee if given the chance. “Maybe if the committee had talked to real people and accessed their notes we wouldn’t have to have this conversation,” he said, describing the matter as an “example of [committee] methodology. Take a stray ‘fact’ and claim its meaning to fit the desired narrative (mass deception).”
The report cites other cases in which CIA officials are alleged to have obscured facts about the program. In 2003, when David Addington, a lawyer who worked for Vice President Richard B. Cheney, asked whether the CIA had videotaped interrogations of Abu Zubaida, CIA General Counsel Scott Muller informed agency colleagues that he had “told him that tapes were not being made.” Muller apparently did not mention that the CIA had recorded dozens of interrogation sessions or that some in the agency were eager to have them destroyed.
The tapes were destroyed in 2005 at the behest of Rodriguez, a move that triggered a Justice Department investigation. The committee also revealed that a 21-hour section of recordings — which depicted the waterboarding of Abu Zubaida — had gone missing years earlier when then-CIA Inspector General John Hel­gerson’s office sought to review them as part of an inquiry into the interrogation program.
Helgerson would go on to find substantial problems with the program. But, in contrast to the Senate panel’s findings, his report concluded that the agency’s “interrogation of terrorists has provided intelligence that has enabled the identification and apprehension of other terrorists and warned of terrorist plots planned for the United States and around the world.”
Intelligence claims
A prominent section of the Senate report is devoted to high-profile claims that the interrogation program produced “unique” and otherwise unobtainable intelligence that helped thwart plots or led to the capture of senior al-Qaeda operatives.
Senate investigators said none of the claims held up under scrutiny, with some unraveling because information was erroneously attributed to detainees subjected to harsh interrogations, others because the CIA already had information from other sources. In some cases, according to the panel, there was no viable terrorist plot to disrupt.
A document prepared for Cheney before a March 8, 2005, National Security Council meeting noted in a section titled “Interrogation Results” that “operatives Jose Padilla and Binyam Mohammed planned to build and detonate a ‘dirty bomb’ in the Washington DC area.”
But according to an April 2003 CIA e-mail, Padilla and Mohammed had apparently taken seriously a “ludicrous and humorous” article about building a dirty bomb in a kitchen by swinging buckets of uranium to enrich it.
KSM dismissed the idea, as did a government assessment of the proposed plot: “CIA and Lawrence Livermore National Lab have assessed that the article is filled with countless technical inaccuracies which would likely result in the death of anyone attempting to follow the instructions, and definitely would not result in a nuclear explosion,” noted another CIA e-mail in April 2003. The agency nonetheless continued to directly cite the “dirty bomb” plot while defending the interrogation program until at least 2007, the report notes.
The report also deconstructs the timeline leading to the identification of Padilla and his alleged accomplice. It notes that in April 2002, Pakistani authorities who detained Padilla suspected he was an al-Qaeda member. A few days later, Abu Zubaida described two individuals who were pursuing what was described as a “cockamamie” dirty-bomb plot. The connection was made by the CIA immediately, months before the use of harsh interrogation on Abu Zubaida.
Some within the CIA were derisive of the continuing exploitation of the dirty-bomb plot by the agency. “We’ll never be able to successfully expunge Padilla and the ‘dirty bomb’ plot from the lore of disruption, but once again I’d like to go on the record that Padilla admitted that the only reason he came up with so-called ‘dirty bomb’ was that he wanted to get out of Afghanistan and figured that if he came up with something spectacular, they’d finance him,” wrote the head of the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear group at the CIA Counterterrorism Center. “Even KSM says Padilla had a screw loose.”
In the CIA’s rebuttal, which was delivered in 2013 to the Senate but released publicly on Tuesday for the first time, the agency acknowledged that it took “too long to stop making references to his infeasible ‘Dirty Bomb’ plot” but said Padilla was a legitimate threat and “a good example of the importance of intelligence derived from the detainee program.”
In another high-profile case, the CIA credited the interrogation program with the capture of Hambali, a senior member of the Southeast Asian militant group Jemaah Islamiah and the suspected mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed more than 200 people. In a briefing for the president’s chief of staff, for instance, the CIA wrote, “During [KSM’s] interrogation we acquired information that led to the capture of Hambali.” But the Senate found that information from KSM played no role in Hambali’s capture and that, in fact, information leading to his detention came from signals intelligence, a CIA source, and investigations by the Thai authorities.
Similarly, the CIA said the interrogation program led to the discovery of the “Second Wave” attacks, a plan by KSM to employ non-Arabs to use airplanes to hit targets on the West Coast. Associated with this in CIA reporting was the identification of al-Ghuraba, a cell of Jemaah Is­lamiah.
In a November 2007 briefing for Bush on “Plots Discovered as a Result of EITs,” or “enhanced interrogation techniques,” the CIA said it “learned” about the Second Wave and al-Ghuraba “after applying the waterboard along with interrogation techniques.” But the Senate report says the plot was disrupted by a series of arrests and interrogations that had nothing to do with the CIA program.
Even the hunt for bin Laden was accompanied by exaggerations of the role of brutal interrogation techniques, according to the report. In particular, the committee found that the interrogations played no meaningful role in the identification of a courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, who would lead the agency to bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
The CIA’s document reiterates its claim that coercive measures helped, saying the tactics led two detainees in agency custody, Ammar al-Baluchi and Hassan Ghul, to provide important clues to the courier. Baluchi was the first to identify Kuwaiti as bin Laden’s messenger, and did so only “after undergoing enhanced interrogation techniques.”
Ghul, who was captured in Iraq, went even further, confirming under coercive pressure that Kuwaiti had delivered a letter from bin Laden to another al-Qaeda operative and had vanished along with the al-Qaeda chief in 2002.
But the committee cited CIA records showing that Ghul’s revelations came before he was subjected to harsh measures. In an interview with the CIA inspector general’s office, a CIA officer familiar with Ghul’s case said that he “sang like a tweetie bird. He opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset.”

Naxals extorting Rs 140 crore annually: Haribhai ChaudharyBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 10, 2014 3:37 pm
Naxals are reportedly extorting a “levy” of about Rs 140 crore annually from a variety of sources, Government said on Wednesday.
The extremists have killed 5,024 civilians in the last 10 years, a majority of them tribals.
“The Left Wing Extremists groups are reported to extort ‘levy’ from industrialists, businessmen, contractors particularly Tendu patta contractors, transporters, government servants and various illegal mining mafia groups in the LWE affected states. Though an exact quantification is not possible, a study conducted by the Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis, Delhi has assessed that the CPI(Maoist) party has been collecting not less than Rs 140 crore annually from a variety of sources,” Minister of State for Home Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply.
Talking about the killings of civilians by Naxals, the Minister said many instances of atrocities on villagers by the Maoists have come to notice. Most of these villagers include tribals. These atrocities include killings of innocent civilians, extortion, sexual exploitation of women and forced recruitment of children.
“In order to instil a sense of fear in their areas of dominance, the Maoists also kill civilians after branding them as police informers. Out of 5,024 civilians killed by the Maoists since 2004-2014 (upto November 30, 2014), the overwhelming majority are tribals. The Maoists have in reality killed thousands of innocent Adivasis, whose cause they profess to espouse,” he said.
Chaudhary added that instances of sexual exploitation of tribal women by Naxals has also been reported.
“Sexual exploitation of tribal women cadres in the Maoist camps have been disclosed in statements of several surrendered women CPI (Maoist) cadres of Odisha, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand and other states. Such instances of sexual exploitation include rape, forced marriage and molestation by senior male CPI (Maoist) cadres.
“In Chhattisgarh, some surrendered tribal CPI (Maoist) male cadres have disclosed that they were forced by the senior leadership to undergo vasectomy operations as a pre-condition for marriage with women cadres.
“There are allegations that women cadres of CPI (Maoist), who become pregnant, are forced to undergo abortion against their will. The surrendered women cadres have also disclosed that even if they are married to male cadres, they are not allowed to have children since the senior leadership of the CPI (Maoist) feel that it impairs their fighting capability and mobility,” he said.

No plan to ban diesel cars: GovernmentMercedes- Benz posts record sales in India during 2014
The government on Tuesday said that at present it does not have any plans to ban all diesel cars in Delhi and convert them into CNG-driven vehicles.
In a written reply, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar informed Lok Sabha that the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (ECPA) for the National Capital Region in in its report in the year 2007 in the matter of a writ petition to the Supreme Court had recommended that use of diesel in personal transport vehicles in the city of Delhi, need to be stopped.
“Later…a report dated February 14, 2014 of EPCA is filed in the Supreme Court wherein ECPA has suggested the introduction of stringent measures for Vehicular Policy including framing of various norms, imposition of heavy taxes on purchase of new vehicles, restriction on number of vehicles in National Territory of Delhi as well as regulation of traffic coming from the neighbouring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan,” he said.
“Presently, the government does not have any plans to ban all diesel cars in Delhi and convert them into CNG,” he said.
The Minister said Indian vehicles are designed for optimum performance of emissions and fuel efficiency in the Indian conditions.
“From the technology perspective, vehicles in India are at par with international technologies, as several of the vehicle models are exported and many of the international brands are also imported in India,” he said.
The Minister, however, said because of various reasons, such as quality of fuel, traffic condition, road conditions and driving behaviour, fuel efficiency of the vehicles achieved in the country may vary.
Referring to a report submitted by an expert committee on Auto Fuel Vision and Policy 2025, he said this expert committee has submitted its detailed recommendation to address the vehicular pollution through a long-term emission road map till 2025.
“It has been recommended that for four wheelers BS IV emission norms will be implemented from the year 2017 onwards across the country, while BS V and BS VI emission norms will be implemented from the years 2020-21 and 2024, respectively,” he said.

Omar failed to carry forward Congress development agenda: Ghulam Nabi AzadBy: Press Trust of India | Rajouri (j-k) |
Posted: December 10, 2014 5:14 pm
Targeting Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Wednesday said the National Conference leader “failed” to carry forward the developmental agenda started by Congress-led coalition government in 2005 in Jammu and Kashmir.
“Young and incumbent Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has failed to carry forward the developmental agenda started by Congress-led coalition government in 2005,” Azad, who is also the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, said while on a campaign trail in border belt of Rajouri district.
Azad also accused NC of initiating a “misinformation campaign” against his party.
“When Congress agreed to come in alliance with National Conference, we were quite hopeful that young Omar Abdullah will carry forward the developmental activities initiated by Congress party in all the three regions of the state”.
“But to our utter surprise, he put all the developmental works initiated by Congress to a standstill,” Azad claimed.
Further lambasting the former coalition partner of Congress, Azad said, “Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah remained chief ministers here in J&K. NC ruled the state for most of maximum tenure since 1947 but failed to come up to the expectations of the people”.
The former J&K chief minister also attacked PDP and BJP, accusing the two parties of “dividing people on communal lines just for votes and thereby spoiling the secular atmosphere of the state”.

Himachal police alerts Interpol  immigration authorities after idol theftWritten by Ashwani Sharma | Shimla/dharamshala |
Posted: December 10, 2014 6:10 pm
Himachal Pradesh police on December 10 alerted Interpol and immigration authorities about theft of priceless and revered idol of Lord Raghunath from Kullu temple.
The state government also announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for anyone giving any clue about the theft that could led to recovery of the idol and other stolen articles.
The police, which has set-up a six member Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Nihal Chand, Additional SP Kullu, have launched a major manhunt to nab the thieves and other persons involved in the theft.
Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Sanjay Kundu, who is camping at Kullu, told the Indian Express, “Police are working on some different leads including monitoring of telephone details of some suspects .We have persons experts in different fields in the SIT to collectively investigate the case.”
There is still a sense of disbelief and shock in Kullu about the theft as the police suspect involvement of some persons who had information about lack of security at the temple during the night hours.
Maheshwar Singh, sitting MLA and Chief kardar (servant ) of Lord Raghunath – which is a presiding deity of historic Kullu Dussehra – had claimed that the burglars have adopted the same modus operandi as they did in January 2014 when an aborted attempt was made to steal the idol.
“We are looking into the earlier case also and it could also provide them vital clues “, said DGP Sanjay Kumar.

Attempted suicide no longer punishable by prison: GovtIrom Sharmila (left) has been on hunger strike in protest against army atrocities in the northeastern state of Manipur.(Source: Deepak Shijagurumayum)
By: Reuters | New Delhi |
Posted: December 10, 2014 6:58 pm
India on December 10 dropped attempted suicide from a list of crimes punishable by prison, potentially paving the way for the release of a human rights activist who has been on hunger strike for the past 14 years.
The government informed parliament of its decision in a written reply from the home ministry on Wednesday, saying it was acting on a recommendation of the Law Commission.
The government panel for legal reform had deemed the suicide law “anachronistic” and “undesirable” in a 2008 report.
Irom Sharmila has been on hunger strike in protest against army atrocities in the northeastern Indian state of Manipur. Under the old law anyone attempting to kill themselves is liable for a jail term of a year.
She has been under detention throughout her fast, and is force-fed by tubes several times a day.
The World Health Organization has listed India as one of the countries with the highest suicide rates – 21.1 per 100,000 people in 2012.
The Indian government said 134,799 people committed suicide in 2013, a rise of 11.9 percent over the previous year. There was no data on the number of attempted suicides, it said.
More than 800,000 people each year worldwide commit suicide – around one person every 40 seconds – WHO said in September.

SpiceJet flyers seeking refunds may have to wait for a few daysSpiceJet flyers seeking refunds may have to wait for a few days
Aneesh Phadnis | Mumbai Dec 10, 2014 10:45 PM IST
The flight cancellations, as many as 1,800, by budget-carrier SpiceJet has left thousands of passengers in the lurch. Many who had booked months in advance for the December holidays were scrambling for refunds.
While the airline has promised refunds within 10 days and has deployed additional manpower in its customer-care department, the extra measures have been inadequate to deal with the volume of calls and emails it has received in the past few days.
ALSO READ: DGCA asks SpiceJet to give funding plan by Dec 15
A SpiceJet spokesperson said the affected passengers could contact the call centre or email requests for refunds or re-bookings. Alternatively passengers could approach the airline's office at the airport.
"Passengers have the option of taking an instant refund in the form of eCash for use in future bookings, or getting a refund into their bank accounts or credit cards in line with the payment mode used at the time of booking," said a spokesperson of Yatra.com.

Amit Agarwal, co-founder of Trip Factory, which powers the holiday package business of SpiceJet, said the company was re-booking  affected customers on other airlines.
The SpiceJet spokesperson added the airline makes refund payments by issuing cheques even when the ticket is purchased paying cash from airport counters.
A travel agent pointed out refunds were being paid but there were delays. “There is a bit of uncertainty about their operations. Passengers are not getting timely response from the call centre and refunds are being delayed.”
SpiceJet said there could be one to two days’ delay in refund claims but that would be due to administrative reasons, as the number of claims was high. The number of grievance calls to the airline is up exponentially and many passengers who had called up said no one answered the call or found the line busy. Travel agents also pointed out tickets refunds were getting delayed while some passengers complained there was no information whether SpiceJet would re-book affected passengers on other airlines.
The spokesperson conceded that it was difficult for the staff to attend to all the calls promptly due to the very large volume. “Our customer experience team is working round the clock,'' he said.  The airline has added extra phone lines and staff at customer care. Earlier this week, SpiceJet said it had provided refunds of all bookings for cancelled flights made directly with the airline (credit card or cash) within an average of 10 days, with no deduction of any kind. Service charges and deductions, if any, by travel agents was not in SpiceJet’s control, the airline had said.

Spicejet gets a breather: Govt gives time till Monday to clear Rs 200 cr AAI duesRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
Beleaguered low-cost carrier Spicejet seems to have received a temporary breather from the government, official sources told FE. With the loss-making airline making an interim payment of Rs 5 crore on Wednesday against dues of about Rs 200 crore to state-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI), the ministry of civil aviation has allowed it time till Monday (December 15) to furnish the balance.
This comes after the government’s current deadline for payment ended on Wednesday (December 10). Incidentally, Spicejet was also offered an alternative option to furnish equivalent bank guarantees, though bankers told FE that it was unlikely it will receive any such guarantee without security.
“The issue has been handled. We are not on cash and carry for any airport,” a Spicejet official confirmed the development.
If the government had stood its ground, Kalanithi Maran-promoted Spicejet would have been put on a cash and carry mode under which it would have had to clear all airport charges like landing and parking fees each time a flight takes off.
Separately, Spicejet also has to submit a payment plan to aviation regulator DGCA by Monday (December 15) in order to assure the regulator that the airline’s financials are strong enough to carry on operations with no threat to safety. Official sources said that the airline owes about Rs 1,600 crore to various vendors and business partners – including about Rs 700 crore to lessors for aircraft, though company officials have claimed that the figures is “significantly less”.
On Tuesday, top Spicejet executives like COO Sanjiv Kapoor, and officials from promoter Chennai-based Sun Group, such as group CFO S L Narayan, met the DGCA Prabhat Kumar and other top government officials. The DGCA asked the airline to submit a “concrete revival plan” with specifics on how it plans to recapitalise, in order to ensure the airline does not go down like Kingfisher Airlines in 2012. Moreover, Sun Group officials have also sought a meeting with the union civil aviation minister P Ashok Gajapathi Raju.
Spicejet, which posted a record loss of Rs 1,003 crore in FY14, currently has accumulated losses of Rs 2,958 crore and a negative net worth of Rs 1,459 crore. The airline, which has reduced its Boeing 737 fleet to 22 from 37 last year by returning old aircraft with high maintenance costs, has cut about 70 flights a day from 350 in July this year. It is also behind on salary payments, especially to employees in the top 15% wage bracket, while several pilots are also said to be leaving for rival airlines.
The Spicejet scrip at the BSE closed 3.51% up to Rs 16.20 on Wednesday.

(The 30-share index ended…)
MUMBAI: Rebounding from over one-month lows, benchmark Sensex today closed 34 points higher to end at 27,831.10, snapping its three-day losing trend, on gains in SBI and ONGC shares, amid a firm European trend.
The wide-based 50-issue NSE Nifty also recovered by 14.95 points, or 0.18 per cent, to close at 8,355.65.
While session was markedly choppy in the absence of strong local cues, buying in key counters supported Sensex and Nifty. Two-tier stocks attracted buying from retail investors, helping their indices outperform broader benchmarks.
Rise in SBI, ONGC, Tata Motors, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Dr Reddy's Lab, Cipla, Hero MotoCorp and Tata Power helped markets end in the positive terrain. However, fall in L&T, RIL, HUL, Bajaj Auto, BHEL and Gail India capped the rise.
The BSE 30-share barometer resumed lower in line with mixed cues from Asian peers and moved erratically in a range of 27,905.25 and 27,710.03 before concluding at 27,831.10, showing a rise of 34.09 points or 0.12 per cent. In previous three sessions, it had tumbled 765.81 points or 2.68 per cent.

Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 221.52 crore yesterday as per provisional data.
Asian markets ended mixed, tracking an uninspiring finish on Wall Street overnight triggered by global growth concerns. Fresh political uncertainty in Greece, a rout in oil prices and a selloff in Chinese shares in the previous session continued to cast their shadow.
"Outcome of the Greece crisis and the way they come to an agreement over the credit line instead of the bailout, would drive the market direction in the short term," said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.
Key indices from China, Hong Kong and Singapore closed with gains while those from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan finished with losses. Indices in Germany, the UK and France were up by 0.29 per cent to 0.79 per cent.
US stocks ended mixed yesterday with the Nasdaq Composite rallying after stiff losses, as investor concern about the global economy ebbed.
Jignesh Chaudhary, Head of Research, Veracity Broking said, "Concerns over global growth, political uncertainty in Greece and India's CAD issue forced local indices to trade weak for the past three days in a row. However, local equities today gained with the help of some bluechips."
In the domestic market, 13 scrips out of the 30-share Sensex pack ended higher while 17 others declined.
Major Sensex gainers were SBI (3.06 per cent), ONGC (2.44 per cent), Tata Power (1.87 per cent), Tata Motors (1.53 per cent), Cipla (1.48 per cent), Dr Reddy's Lab (1.37 per cent) and Hero Motocorp (1.13 per cent).

Among the S&P BSE sectoral indices, Consumer Durable index rose by 2.43 per cent, followed by Bankex 1.01 per cent and Power 0.74 per cent while Capital Goods fell by 0.99 per cent.
Small-cap and Mid-cap indices also rose by 1.06 per cent and 0.93 per cent respectively on fresh buying from retail investors.
Overall market breadth turned positive as 1,665 stocks finished higher, 1,268 stocks ended lower while 106 ruled steady. Total turnover moved up slightly to Rs 3,040.59 crore from Rs 3,049.29 crore yesterday.

Vikram Akula buys 26% stake in start-up Vaya Finserv; eyes small bank licenceRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
Having forced to quit SKS Microfinance, which he founded, three years ago, Vikram Akula has returned to the financial inclusion space by buying 26 per cent stake in a start-up Vaya Finserv, which is also eyeing small bank licence.
Akula, once seen as the poster boy of microfinance in India, has joined the Hyderabad-based business correspondent firm as Chairman.
“Now that my three-year non-compete period (with SKS) is over I was looking to get back to financial inclusion. I chose to join Vaya because it is focused on under-banked districts,” Akula said today.
He, however, declined to give details about the amount he has invested to buy the stake.
Besides Akula, SKS Trust, which he runs, holds around 65 per cent in Vaya and the rest is owned by the employees. Vaya, which started its operation this July, facilitates savings and loans for women’s self-help groups.
Akula said Vaya will be applying for small finance banks. “We will apply for small finance banks licence. We are talking to external advisors and preparing the application.”
Akula was forced to resign from SKS board after the micro lender suffered heavy losses in key market of Andhra Pradesh.
RBI last month issued final guidelines on small finance and payment banks. It will accept the applications for differentiated banks licences till January 16.
Currently, Vaya is working as a business correspondent on behalf of Yes Bank in four districts of Marathwada region of Maharashtra and two districts of northern Karnataka.
The company is also in talks with some public as well as private sector banks to work for them as business correspondent. Vaya has 183 employees and disbursed 7.5 crore of loans so far.

India should allow banks to hold gold as reservesChange
By Meenakshi Sharma and A. Ananthalakshmi
MUMBAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - India should allow banks to use gold as part of their liquidity reserves, which would let them make more use of gold inside the country and reduce the need for imports, an industry body said on Tuesday, seeing that as an alternative to import curbs.
The world's second-biggest consumer of the metal should also consider setting up an exchange for transparent gold pricing and to streamline trade, according to a report commissioned by the World Gold Council (WGC).
"We have made our points to the government and some of these recommendations are in consideration," Somasundaram PR, head of the WGC's India operations, told Reuters. He did not elaborate.
Last year, struggling with a high trade deficit, India imposed a record 10 percent import duty on gold and a rule requiring a fifth of all imports to be re-exported. Bullion is the second-biggest item on India's import bill after oil.
The WGC says allowing banks to hold gold as part of their liquidity reserves would motivate them to introduce gold deposit schemes, which would in turn circulate existing bullion within the country, removing some of the need to import fresh supply.
"The solution to meeting India's enduring appetite for gold lies not in restricting the import of gold, but in making better use of the gold that is already in the country, making it a productive, fungible asset class like any other financial savings," Somasundaram said in a separate statement.
About 22,000 tonnes of gold is estimated to be held in Indian households.
Gold deposit schemes are already offered by banks but have not proved popular with consumers, who prefer to hold their gold in ornament form and would need strong incentives to give up heirlooms and wedding gifts.
Once the consumer deposits gold with the bank, it is refined to be sold to others. The consumer earns interest and receives gold bars when the term matures, regardless of what was originally deposited.
"At present, financial products linked to gold have been poorly marketed. If banks were able to include gold in their reserve calculations, they would be financially incentivised to innovate, market and explain gold-based products," the WGC report said.
The re-export rule was scrapped late last month to counter the smuggling and high premiums that had resulted.
Although the rules had curbed gold supplies entering India, consumer demand remained strong.

Uber Asia-Pacific head quizzed again; Mumbai executive slappedComments
In growing trouble for Uber following the alleged rape of a woman in one of its cabs, the app-based taxi service’s Asia-Pacific head Eric Alexander was questioned by Delhi Police for the second day in a row on Wednesday even as its general manager in Mumbai was slapped in public.

Uber cabs also seemed to go off Delhi’s roads as its mobile app stopped working, three days after the city government banned all web-based cab services . Later in the day, the Maharashtra government decided to follow suit and enforce the ban in the state.
However, Ola was still taking bookings through its app and call centre and Taxi For Sure’s app was also working in Delhi, though HT’s attempts to book a cab was met with a ‘try later’ response.
App-based taxis continue accepting bookings despite ban
Through the day, traffic police and transport department impounded 738 taxis found to be flouting the ban and prosecuted 2,601 drivers. But department officials were still figuring out how to enforce the ban effectively.
In Mumbai, Uber GM Shailesh Sawlani was slapped by a member of Swabhiman Sanghatana — an NGO led by Congress MLA Nitesh Rane — after he stepped out of a meeting of radio cab representatives called by the transport commissioner. Sawlani did not suffer any serious harm as the traffic police intervened. No complaint or FIR was filed.
In Delhi, Uber’s Asia-Pacific head Alexander presented himself at the office of DCP (north) Madhur Verma in connection with the cheating case registered against the company for its failure to run a background check on the accused driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav.
He was questioned on Tuesday evening too for almost three hours, police sources said.
Alexander was asked specifically about complaints against 32-year-old Shiv Kumar Yadav, the driver accused of raping a woman executive of a Gurgaon-based finance company on Friday night.
Investigations have revealed Yadav is a serial sex offender , who has faced two previous rape cases. Uber did not run a background check on him.
On Tuesday, US-based Nidhi Shah revealed that Yadav had stared at her lecherously when she took his cab on November 26, but the company had taken no action on her complaint.
“We had asked him (Alexander) to submit documents, including details of taxis and drivers working with them, how they checked their antecedents, security measures adopted by them, details of formal/informal complaints filed against their drivers anywhere in India,” said additional DCP (north) Brijender Kumar Yadav.
Alexander said as he left a little over an hour later: “My heart feels sympathy for the girl. We cannot comment on the case as it is an ongoing investigation. We are cooperating with the police."
Telangana, Andhra ban Uber
Authorities in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh too banned Uber. The transport departments in both states said Uber had no permission to operate and advised people to refrain from hiring cabs using the app-based service.
In Hyderabad and neighbouring Ranga Reddy district, special teams of Road Transport Authority (RTA) and police launched a crackdown on Uber and other services operating illegally.
The officials seized several cabs in Hyderabad and Cyberabad police commissionerates for unauthorised operations.
Noida, Ghaziabad follow the same route
The Uttar Pradesh transport department said it had banned Uber cab services in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad.
“I have issued instructions to concerned officials in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar district and cab operators to identify all kinds of vehicles being used as cabs defying laid down norms. I have directed to ban all cabs including that of Uber, which are operating flouting safety and motor vehicle acts,” said Mayank Jyoti, regional transport officer (RTO) for Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and Bulandshahr district.
TN on alert
Though the Tamil Nadu government is yet to ban any taxi service in the wake of a suggestion from the Centre, transport department officials say new guidelines aimed at streamlining taxi operations and tightening regulations are being worked out.
In Tamil Nadu, the Madras high court had earlier directed the state government to properly regulate taxi services.

Women-only cab companies cash in on Uber fears | Taxi co investors rain criticism on banTweet
BPAC has proposed Durga alarms in buses and autos in Bangalore to the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC).
NEW DELHI: About 40 cabs, all painted pink and plying the roads of Kerala, may provide the hint of a solution to the problem of women's safety. She-Taxi, a cab company that runs this service employing only women drivers, is now looking to expand into Delhi and Mumbai.
Two other companies — GCabs and Priyadarshini — which also run cab services with women drivers in other states are also looking to expand nationally.
Apart from GPS and GPRS installed in every cab, both, GCabs and She-Taxi have separate alarms for driver and passenger in the cabs connected to their respective call centres.
Bangalore Political Action Committee (BPAC), whose members include Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and TV Mohandas Pai, has conceptualised the "Gulabi Auto" project, an auto rickshaw service operated entirely by women. This is currently under the consideration by the Karnataka government .
"Safety is a big issue and this project also solves the problems of providing livelihood to women and empowering them. If women can be construction workers then why not auto drivers," said Revathy Ashok, CEO and managing trustee, BPAC.
BPAC has also proposed Durga alarms in buses and autos in Bangalore to the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), which agreed to such a pilot. These Durga alarms can be triggered in buses and autos by women passengers if they feel unsafe or are under threat.
They would work on the lines of an ambulance siren to alert people on the roads.
"We have pushed aggressively for the Gulabi auto project but the government seems to be dragging its feet on this. Bangalore would probably have the largest working population of women employees working late nights, and the government seems to be apathetic to their needs," said TV Mohandas Pai,VP, BPAC.
All She-Taxi drivers own the cabs they run and easily earn between Rs 5,000 and Rs 20,000 per month.

Nikkei Losses 1.6%; Falling Oil Hits Risk Sentiment, Dollar Pressured
Reuters | Updated On: December 11, 2014 07:28 (IST)
L&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
Tokyo: Asian stocks fell early on Thursday as falling oil prices continued to feed into global growth concerns, while the dollar lost more ground against peers such as the yen and euro after a further drop in US bond yields.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 per cent as another large drop in oil prices took a heavy toll on energy shares and hit Wall Street hard overnight.
Crude oil prices fell as much as 5 per cent overnight after data underscored weak US demand and Saudi Arabia reiterated that it has no plans to curb output.
US crude posted a modest rebound early on Thursday after the overnight tumble, gaining 26 cents to $61.20 a barrel after falling to a 5-1/2 year low of $60.43 on Wednesday.
Tokyo's Nikkei lost 1.6 per cent, pulling further back from 7-1/2 year highs hit at the week's start, with sentiment bruised by the rout in US stocks, while the yen's rebound against the dollar showed little sign of ending.
The dollar was down 0.1 per cent at 117.610 yen, continuing its retreat from a seven-year high of 121.86 reached on Monday.
The S&P 500, at a record high just last Friday, fell to its lowest since early November on Wednesday.
"Recent nervousness in equity market sentiment is consistent with our view that equity fund positioning is near peak levels, which points to a near-term pullback," strategists at Barclays said in a note to clients.
"With underperformance by active managers, we worry that redemptions will continue and force an unwind of currently extended positioning," they said.
In addition to declining oil, concerns over the political situation in Greece have also dented appetite for risk assets.
The euro gained 0.3 per cent to $1.2479, putting further distance between a 2-1/2 year trough of $1.2247 hit on Monday.
Safe-haven government debt remained better-bid, with the 10-year US Treasury yield dropping by a basis point to 2.1603.
The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield fell 1.5 basis points to 0.390 per cent, lowest since April 2013.

Dow Jones Falls 1.5% as Oil Shares Tumble
AFP | Updated On: December 11, 2014 07:41 (IST)
US stocks tumbled more than 1.5 per cent Wednesday as a pullback in petroleum stocks sparked a sell-off in the broader market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 268.05 points (1.51 per cent) to 17,533.15.
The broad-based S&P 500 sank 33.68 (1.64 per cent) to 2,026.14, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index plummeted 82.44 (1.73 per cent) to 4,684.03.
Beaten-down petroleum-linked stocks had another bad day as US oil prices sank to a fresh-five year low on a forecast by the OPEC cartel for lower demand for its oil in 2015.
Dow members ExxonMobil and Chevron skidded nearly 3.0 per cent and 2.0 per cent, respectively. Occidental Petroleum fell 3.0 per cent and oil services company Weatherford International plummeted 7.0 per cent.
Investors are worried about the "unknown" of "how this decline in oil prices will affect other sectors of the economy," said David Levy, portfolio manager at Kenjol Capital Management.
Peter Coleman, head of trading at Convergex, said lower oil prices are generally good for the US economy, but that the free-fall in commodity prices "makes people nervous."
The S&P 500 volatility index, sometimes called the "fear index," rose to its highest level since mid-October.
Wednesday's sell-off was broad-based and swept up virtually all of the 30-stock Dow, including Boeing (-3.9 per cent), Caterpillar (-2.6 per cent) and Goldman Sachs (-2.5 per cent).
Airlines outperformed other sectors as the International Air Transport Association predicted the sector's profits would rise to $25 billion in 2015 from $18 billion in 2013, due in part to lower oil prices.
American Airlines rose 1.3 per cent and United Continental jumped 1.9 per cent, while Delta Air Lines dipped 0.2 per cent.
Dow member JPMorgan Chase dropped 2.8 per cent after the Federal Reserve said the largest US bank by assets would need $22 billion more in capital by 2019 to meet new capital rules for systemically important financial institutions.
Yum Brands, which owns KFC and other fast-food chains, fell 6.2 per cent after saying its China division's same-store sales for 2014 would be "negative mid-single digits" due to an unexpectedly slow recovery following a tainted-meat scandal involving a supplier.
Bond prices declined. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell to 2.17 per cent from 2.22 per cent Tuesday, while the 30-year dropped to 2.84 per cent from 2.88 per cent. Bond prices and yields move inversely.

Ex-Madoff computer programmer gets two-and-a-half years prison for fraud5
The five employees are among 15 people who have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. Madoff is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading guilty in 2009 to running a scheme that cost investors an estimated $17 billion or more in principal.
Prosecutors said the five employees knowingly propped up Madoff's fraud by creating fake documents and backdating trades.
Prosecutors said Crupi, who managed accounts purporting to have a $900 million balance in 2008, helped generate fictitious trading data presented to firm clients.
Prosecutors had sought more than 14 years in prison for Crupi, who was convicted of securities, conspiracy and other charges with the other four employees.
But Swain imposed a more lenient term, as she did in sentencing the other employees, a trend a prosecutor last week said set a bad precedent.
Daniel Bonventre, Madoff's former back office director, was sentenced last Monday to the longest prison term, 10 years.
Annette Bongiorno, Madoff's former secretary and later a manager, received six years in prison, while computer programmers Jerome O'Hara and George Perez received 2-1/2 years in prison each.
Prosecutors sought more than 20 years for Bonventre and Bongiorno and more than eight for Perez and O'Hara.
The defendants, who are expected to appeal, have said Madoff deceived them into believing the business was legitimate.
Crupi told Swain on Monday that she had believed Madoff, who had discouraged her from learning about the securities industry.
"Knowing my work played a part in carrying out this horrible scheme will cause me shame and remorse for the rest of my life," Crupi said.

Oil traders buy $100 options  betting on a reboundMobius Risk Group
(Some argue that it is an opportune…)
NEW YORK: Oil traders have been quietly buying cheap, far out-of-the-money call options at $100 a barrel, betting that the biggest sell-off since the financial crisis has gone too far and that crude is likely to rebound by this time next year.
Open interest in US crude oil $100 calls for December 2015 has jumped 13 per cent in the last two weeks to nearly 37,000 on Wednesday, with a premium of around 40 cents.
For the December 2016 $100 calls, open interest has surged by more than 50 per cent to nearly 16,000, with a premium of around $1.00, according to exchange data.
With US crude oil futures for January hovering at just above $60 a barrel, down from nearly $108 a barrel in June, traders aren't likely counting on those options to expire in the money but rather betting that their value will increase provided oil prices bottom out or begin to creep up next year.
"People don't trade options because they think the price will necessarily get there. They're looking for relatively good value," said John Saucer, vice president of research and analytics at Mobius Risk Group in Houston.
"The question is: How do you get the most bang for your buck?" he said.
Since the summer, oversupplied global markets coupled with lackluster demand kicked off a sell-off in both the US crude and Brent contracts. The sell-off accelerated following the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) meeting in Vienna last month, when member countries decided not to cut production amid speculation of a price war.
The motivations for investors to have so many open contracts in those two months at $100 are not immediately clear. High levels of activity in December are not a surprise as it is among the most liquid months of the year for hedging.
Yet, some argue that it is an opportune moment to buy as falling prices have increased the put skew - the difference in implied volatility for out-of-the-money and in-the-money options - allowing more upside potential to the call side.
"There are too many guys on the short side now," said one trader.

Modi, Putin to meet today to ink pacts on energy, defence
Putin is likely to seek deeper economic engagement with India to try to minimise impact of sanctions against Russia by the US and its Western allies over the Ukraine issue.

Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Delhi late on Wednesday night for the annual summit talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday that is aimed at building on the already close strategic ties, particularly in the fields of nuclear energy, hydrocarbons and defence.
Putin, who is accompanied by a high-level delegation that included business tycoons, was received by Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan among other dignitaries. After the talks at Hyderabad House, the two sides are likely to ink 15-20 pacts. The talks at the highest level have been taking place since 2000 alternately in Moscow and New Delhi.
In his talks with Modi, both in restricted and delegation level formats, Putin is likely to seek deeper economic engagement with "time-tested" ally India to try to minimise impact of sanctions against Russia by the US and its Western allies over the Ukraine issue.
It will be the first annual summit meeting between Putin and Modi. The two leaders had met on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Brazil in July and during the G-20 summit in Australia in November.
Ahead of his visit, Putin termed ties with India as "privileged strategic partnership" and said construction of new nuclear plants besides military and technical cooperation was high on the agenda for talks. He said Russia was keen to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India and involve ONGC in oil and gas hunt in the Arctic.
Energy-starved India, which is the third largest oil importer after the US and China - has been pushing for greater involvement in major gas and oil exploration projects in Russia and both the leaders are set to discuss the issue. Russia is one of the top oil producers globally and has huge reserves of natural gas.
In the nuclear energy sector, Russia may offer to set up a total of 20-24 nuclear energy production units in India against previously agreed 14-16 plants. Both sides are also likely to come out with a roadmap for cooperation in the overall energy sector. Russian Ambassador Alexander Kadakin said the two countries will start negotiations for setting up of units five and six at the Kudankulam nuclear power complex soon and may sign a technical pact for units 3 and 4 during Putin's stay here.
Russia was awaiting India's decision to allot a site for construction of a new Russian-designed nuclear power plant and the issue may figure in the talks. To improve two-way trade, Putin and Modi are expected to jointly interact with CEOs of major companies from both the countries.
The volume of bilateral trade was USD 10 billion in 2013 and both sides feel there was "huge opportunity" to improve it significantly. India has been working to have a trade pact with "Eurasian space" for improved trade and commerce which will also improve trade with Russia.
India's exports, particularly food items, to Russia have gone up since sanctions were imposed against that country by Western nations for its interventions in the crisis in Ukraine. India has been maintaining that it cannot be party to any economic sanctions against Russia. Both the leaders are likely to discuss improving supply of rough diamonds by Russia to India.
Russia is the world's top producer of rough diamonds and India is one of its largest importers. Putin will also inaugurate World Diamond Conference on Thursday. In the defence sector, Putin may push for larger procurement of military hardware from Russia by India.
Russia has been a major defence supplier to India and its share has been 60-70 per cent in the country's import of military hardware. Sources said specific discussions are likely to take place on various key projects including the envisaged gas pipeline linking Russia with India and the ambitious Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) programme.
Listing the joint strategic projects, Putin said these included construction of new units for Indian nuclear power plants, promotion of Russian Sukhoi superjet-100 and MS-21 passenger aircraft to Indian market besides manufacturing of helicopters and creating a "smart city" on the basis of Russian technology.

Muslim conversion in Agra: Opposition targets govt  FIR registered against RSSLeh, Kargil record season's coldest night, Srinagar at -5.4 C
The alleged forced reconversion of about 100 people to Hinduism in Agra set off a chorus of criticism against the government by the opposition inside and outside Parliament today even as an FIR was filed against an Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) wing behind the incident.
As the opposition parties called it illegal and demanded “strict” action, the government washed its hands off the issue, saying it had no role and that law and order is a state subject. They also demanded the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
Leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed the reconversion was voluntary and that it was not forcibly done.
In Agra, the Sadar Bazar Police registered the FIR late last night against Dharma Jagran Manch and its UP convener Nand Kishore and launched investigations into the incident.
Police registered cases under Section 153 (A) (promoting enmity between different groups) and Section 415 (using fraudulent means) of the IPC on a complaint by a person identified as Ismail, who was among those who was reconverted.
It has been alleged in the FIR that promises were held out by the organisers which included getting BPL cards and housing plots for those who embraced Hinduism.
Raising the issue in Rajya Sabha, BSP chief Mayawati alleged that RSS-affiliate Bajrang Dal converted some Muslim families to Hinduism in Agra by force and by allurement.
The Constitution, she said, guarantees religious freedom and that it was the responsibility of both the Centre and the state government to ensure safety of life, property and religion of all.
“The Government should take serious note of the Agra incident … strict action should be taken,” she said, warning that such forced conversions will create and breed communal tension in the country.
Forced conversions should be stopped, she demanded as members from Congress, Left, TMC and SP echoed her sentiments and shouted ‘Pradhan Mantri Jawab Do (Prime Minister reply)’.
Anand Sharma (Cong) said the government should be directed to give a clarification on the issue.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi informed the agitated members that an FIR has been filed by the Uttar Pradesh government on the issue.
“Action has to be taken by state government. Law and order is a state issue and the state government has to deal with it. Centre has no role in that,” he said. The reconversion issue also had its echo in the Lok Sabha.
Outside Parliament, CPI’s D Raja alleged that attempts are being made to impose the Hindutva agenda on everybody.
CPI-M leader Sitaram Yechury said this is the dirtiest of vote-bank politics being played by RSS and the BJP while former Union minister and Congress leader Veerappa Moily called it “anti- national”.
BJP leader Vinay Katiyar said that the consent of the participants was obtained before their re-conversion.
In UP, the Home Secretary Kamal Saxena said the state government has taken a serious view of the incident and has sent directives to respective district police chiefs to put their intelligence units on alert and check its recurrence.
Responding to questions about the issue of alleged re- conversion of some Muslims in Agra and similar plans in Aligarh, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, “We believe that in this great, grand country of ours, it is most unfortunate that the BJP is continuously taking up three-Cs to confuse, compound and create chaos and three-Ds to divert, digress and depart from real issues.”
He also urged the media to not allow the government to “deliberately divert” attention from the real issues.
Singhvi added that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and its Deputy Leader in Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, have already spoken on the issue.

BSE Sensex ends below 28K  NSE Nifty cracks 8 400 on global sell-offStreet sees good show after stellar year
Indian markets today plunged to over one-month lows with benchmark Sensex tumbling 322.39 points to end at 27,797.01 on losses in power, metal and capital goods shares amid a sell-off in China and other global markets.
The NSE Nifty tanked 97.55 points to end below 8,400-mark at 8,340.70 as stocks fell for the third straight session.
Fall of global crude prices to five-year lows failed to lift the global sentiment as Chinese stocks dropped over 5 per cent on tighter lending norms and over 1 per cent drop in European indices, said traders.
The BSE 30-share Sensex remained in negative terrain for the major part of the session on sustained selling pressure. It moved between 27,763.82 and 28,157.53 range, before ending with a sharp loss of 322.39 points, or 1.15 per cent, at 27,797.01. This is its weakest close since October 30.
In the previous two sessions, Sensex shed 443.42 points.
The overall market breadth was negative as about 900 stocks rose while over 2,000 scrips fell.
“Sell-offs seen in Asian markets…impacted market sentiments for the day. Brent crude was seen dropping to its fresh 5-year lows, below USD 66 a barrel,” said Hiren Dhakan, Associate Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio.
Experts said data showing current account deficit widened to USD 10.1 billion, or 2.1 per cent of GDP, in July-September quarter of this fiscal, raised concerns at a time when markets are pricing are strong recovery of the Indian economy.
Sesa Sterlite shares emerged the biggest loser among Sensex components by tumbling over 5 per cent. Shares of state-run ONGC plunged 4.29 per cent.
Other notable laggards include Tata Power, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Tata Steel, Hindalco, BHEL, L&T, Tata Motors, Wipro, SBI, Cipla, Maruti Suzuki, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank.
Almost all the major Asian stock markets fell after Chinese market tumbled 5.43 per cent, the most since 2009. Indices in Hong Kong and Japan were among the worst-hit.
Sectorally, BSE Power index suffered the most by losing 2.75 per cent, followed by Metal index (2.71 per cent), Capital Goods (2.29 per cent) and Consumer Durables (2.11 per cent) among others. Selling activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum with BSE Smallcap falling 1.59 per cent and Midcap index down 1.57 per cent.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth net Rs 4,984.60 crore yesterday.
Shrikant Chouhan, Head- Technical Research, Kotak Securities:
Today, our markets opened at unchanged levels but unexpected steep weakness in Chinese and other Asian markets had triggered further bearish sentiment in the market. In fact in the absence or delay in positive news flows on the reform side is making impatient to medium term and long term investors. Technically we are of the view that unless and until the market is not approaching to major supports buying may not emerge but it’s a normal correction and investors should use it as an opportunity to buy and traders can take contra view of buying around major supports. In fact, today’s closing is very close to 1st major support, which is around 8300/27700. In case if it fails to sustain above 8300/27700 then the fall may extend up to 8200/27350. However, we are of the view that one should start investing into frontline stocks or index heavy weights with a medium term view (2 to 3months).  We like PSU banks, auto ancillary and pharmaceutical stocks with a medium term view.

Arun Jaitley to meet state Finance Miniters tomorrow on GSTIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will tomorrow meet his state counterparts to iron out the “challenges” in rolling out the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The meeting would “discuss some of the challenges that the states see at this point of time”, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha told reporters on the sidelines of Delhi Economics Conclave here today.
“On GST we are working on variety of discussions with the states. The legislative aspects of the GST are complicated, they have to be approved by the states. CST compensation is one of the item which is under discussion,” he said.
The Centre is working towards rolling out the GST from April 1, 2016, and is in discussion with states to insulate their revenues from the impact of the GST.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT and local levies on the states front.
Sinha said once the issues are resolved the Centre can come up with the legislative calender.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
States have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco be kept out of the purview of the GST.
The GST roll out has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the proposed new tax regime.
On easing restrictions on gold imports, Sinha said the intention of the government was to enable the jewellery sector function efficiently.
“The current account deficit and foreign exchange reserves are in much more comfortable position now. The rupee is stable,” Sinha added.
The CAD, which is the difference between inflow and outflow of foreign exchange, moderated to 1.9 per cent of GDP (USD 17.9 billion) in April-September period of current fiscal.
It was 3.1 per cent (USD 26.9 billion) in the corresponding period last year.
The government had last month scrapped the 80:20 scheme for gold imports under which at least 20 per cent of the imported gold had to be mandatorily exported before bringing in new lots.
Gold imports jumped 280 per cent to USD 4.17 billion in October, as per the latest trade data. The in-bound shipments touched 95 tonnes in September this year as against 12 tonnes a year ago.

Trend Micro says targeted attacks will proliferate; India in line of fireNissan Motor announces pre-bookings of Datsun GO+ in India
Trend Micro Incorporated has released its annual security predictions report, ‘Trend Micro Security Predictions for 2015 and Beyond: The Invisible Becomes Visible,’ and the company’s threat defense experts are highlighting the report’s forecast that targeted attacks will become rampant from more countries as hackers from the usual suspects have found success targeting victims around the world. Additionally, the report breaks downs seven other cybersecurity threat predictions for 2015 including banks and payment systems.
According to the report, targeted attacks campaigns will continue to multiply in 2015, after cybercriminals had noteworthy breaches via targeted attacks in the U.S. and China. Trend Micro’s threat defense experts predict hackers within countries such as Vietnam, UK, and India, will pursue the use of targeted attacks and we will see attacks against non-traditional countries like we’ve seen recently against Malaysia and Indonesia based organizations.
“What we are seeing today is not a huge surprise but rather the velocity and brutal measures cybercriminals are using to steal information,” said, Dhanya Thakkar, Managing Director, India & SEA, Trend Micro. “Following the success of targeted attacks from Chinese and Russian cybercriminals, many hackers from other countries will regard cyber-attacks as a more practical method to grab a foothold in an organization. Additionally, with the incessant barrage of data breaches emerging almost daily, it’s reasonable to presume that data breaches will be essentially regarded as a common offshoot of the present threat landscape.”
Threats around banking will continue to become more severe as more unique cybercrime attacks against financial institutions also emerge and financial and banking intuitions must implement two-factor authentication for online services.
“The payment ecosystem will continue to evolve,” said JD Sherry, vice president of technology and solutions, Trend Micro. “Massive transformation is upon us and we will continue to see threat actors trying to manipulate Near Field Communications (NFC) as certain platforms gain momentum due to their significant following and user’s penchant for adopting the latest and greatest technology.”
Highlights from the 2015 predications report include:
More cybercriminals will turn to darknets and exclusive-access forums to share and sell crimeware. Increased cyber activity will translate to better, bigger, and more successful hacking tools and attempts. Exploits kits will target Android, as mobile vulnerabilities play a bigger role in device infection. Targeted attacks will become as prevalent as cybercrime. New mobile payment methods will introduce new threats. We will see more attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in open source apps.
Technological diversity will save Internet of Everything devices from mass attacks but the same won’t be true for the data they process.
More severe online banking and other financially motivated threats will surface.
The Trend Micro Security Predictions for 2015 also include a continued increase in the exploitation of smart devices such as smart cameras, appliances and TV’s as cybercriminals become more aggressive at targeting these platforms as well as the organizations who manage the data.
As factors like market pressure push device manufacturers to launch more and more smart devices sans security in mind to meet the rising demand, so will attackers increasingly find vulnerabilities to exploit for their own gain.
“Smart homes and home automation will continue to proliferate across the globe, further increasing all of our attack surfaces,” said Sherry. “As such, smart device manufactures must consider how to secure the data that resides in these devices not just the devices themselves.”

After Delhi rape  ex-Uber driver in US rowNissan Motor announces pre-bookings of Datsun GO+ in India
After the rape of 27-year-old MNC Executive in New Delhi by Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, the company has again landed into trouble. A former driver with the company has been charged with manslaughter in the death of a six-year-old girl when he rammed his car into the family as it was crossing a street last year.
Syed Muzzafar, who was working for Uber in San Francisco, hit Huan Kuang, her 4-year-old son Anthony Liu and six-year- old daughter Sophia Liu as they were crossing the street on December 31 last year.
Muzzafar collided his Uber car in the family, seriously injuring Kuang and her son.
The young girl succumbed to her injuries.
Kuang had filed a lawsuit against Uber and Muzzafar in January this year in which she had said that Uber breached its duty of applying “reasonable care” in “hiring, training and supervision” of its drivers.
She had said in the complaint that Muzzafar was “unfit” to be a “provider of transportation and was not “adequately trained or supervised” in his driving.
Muzzafar was charged yesterday in a California court with misdemeanour vehicular manslaughter, which carries penalties of up to one year of jail time.
The case that the family filed against Uber still remains unresolved.
A report in Time magazine said that according to court documents, Muzzafar was in between UberX fares when the accident happened.
Meanwhile, a report in the Huffington Post said that Chicago police is also investigating an allegation that an Uber driver had raped a female customer.
Chicago police said they have been in contact with the woman as well as Uber personnel, but declined to give further details.
The charges against the former Uber driver come at a time when the company is facing severe backlash in India and other cities across the world over concerns about safety and drivers’ negligence.
In New Delhi, the company has been banned after a woman executive accused an Uber driver of raping her.
In growing legal trouble for Uber, the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles have filed a lawsuit against the company for making false and misleading statements to consumers, including about the quality of background checks it performs on drivers.
San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon and Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey filed a civil complaint against Uber alleging that the company engaged in a variety of unlawful business practices in violation of California business laws.
The suit seeks a permanent injunction requiring Uber to stop violating California law.
It also seeks civil penalties for each of the unlawful business acts and practices, as well as full restitution for all California consumers who paid the airport toll.
Uber has been facing increasing backlash in cities across the world because of its operations and drivers.

The rise of Chinas entrepreneurial spiritThe rise of China’s entrepreneurial spirit
Della Bradshaw
©James Ferguson
In the cold basement of an office block in northwest Beijing, a group of would-be entrepreneurs huddle around a computer screen, poring over their latest prototype. A few miles away, in a well-heated and distinctly more luxurious underground lecture room, a group of 30 managers and entrepreneurs also debate ideas for new products and ventures.
Both groups are testament to the growing appetite for start-ups in China. Just as business schools in the US and Europe have reported a surge in student interest in running their own companies, business schools operating in China are also reporting a thirst for all things entrepreneurial.

Dean, businessman and social entrepreneur
“Start-ups are the new sexy thing,” says Yi Wang, co-founder and chief executive of Liu Li Shuo , which developed an English language app for Chinese smartphone users, the only education app selected by Apple in the 2013 App of the year award in China.
“Definitely you’re seeing an increasing trend in entrepreneurship in China. Top-tier venture capital firms are looking for young entrepreneurs — there’s a whole ecosystem coming up,” Mr Wang enthuses. “In recent years companies that have been making the biggest impact on people’s lives have been internet companies and behind them encouraging stories about ordinary people making it big.”
Mr Wang is one of the participants on the 10-week Stanford Ignite programme, which the Silicon Valley business school ran in Beijing for the first time in October and November. There, in the Stanford building in the heart of the Peking University campus, a select group of 30 entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs devise business plans that may one day prove to be highly successful companies.
Mr Wang’s own history is typical of many of China’s new breed of entrepreneurs, he says. He went to the US to study for his PhD, worked for Google for two years and then returned to Shanghai to work for an internet marketing company. His two co-founders report a similar history. As more and more Chinese students study overseas, behaviour at home is changing rapidly, with young people eschewing the traditional large corporation he says.
The sentiment is echoed in the spartan basement that is Tsinghua University’s x-lab, where angel investors rub shoulders with students and alumni from across the university, arguably China’s most prestigious. Between them they are developing everything from the latest electrically powered scooter to moderately priced 3D printers and wearable health monitors.
Since the x-lab launched 18 months ago, some 400 start-ups have used the facilities, says Pearl Mao, executive director. Close to 300 of them continue to flourish and more than 30 of them already have substantial funding.
What is more, every Thursday the x-lab’s team holds project meetings and each week 10 new ventures pitch to become part of x-lab. Those that succeed can use the facilities free of charge
Michael Ma, who graduated from Tsinghua SEM in 2006 with an Executive MBA , fits the bill. He believes there is much to be done in creating English language teaching technology. “China is the biggest market for foreign language learning in the world,” he points out.
His company, Beijing Peapad Education and Technology, targets parents of young children with its small, green, talking pea character, which is controlled through a parent’s smartphone and uses songs and games to teach English.
“There was no such product in the market. We think it is important for Chinese kids to learn English,” he says. “Also we believe there is a lot of money to be made in the industry.”
Mr Ma has ambitions for the Peapad to be on the market in the first half of 2015, and will offer the Peapad hardware for free, with parents buying software, services and access to the community.
“Our ambition is a bit more than language learning,” he says. “There is no smart device [like this] in the market for kids. We believe in the next 10 years this will be a real trend.
“Currently early childhood education is offline all over China, but we believe over the next few years it will all go online. Hardware is a channel and we are providing the channel.”
In developing his product Mr Ma has taken advantage of other start-up ventures in the x-lab — a computer graphics company helped design the website and Peapad games and a 3D printing firm helped develop a scale model. The x-lab offers legal advice on patents and access to Tsinghua’s industrial design centre as well as advice from angel investors and venture capitalists.
It has also performed a more specific educational role, acting as the intersection between Tsinghua’s academic departments, says Ms Mao. So far between 10 and 20 per cent of all Tsinghua students are involved in some way.
Stanford Ignite faculty director Yossi Feinberg says that while New York is the home of media start-ups and Silicon Valley of biomedical and technology companies, there is demand across the board in China. “China is everything. There is a lot of low-hanging fruit.”
The growing middle class in China means high demand, but this can in turn create issues, says Prof Feinberg. “The biggest problem to any venture in China to me is the [low] barriers to entry. The only barrier is, can you create something big enough so others can’t enter the market.”
Now the entrepreneurial genie is out of the bottle, Mr Wang says it is unlikely the process can be reversed. His company resembles a US internet start-up, with free meals and company-funded holidays. Why would people who have operated in this environment all their working lives want to work for a state-owned enterprise, he asks.
 
Spreading the word: Stanford to take its expertise overseas
 
Stanford GSB , the business school at the heart of Silicon Valley, is taking its entrepreneurial know-how to two more of the world’s top cities in 2015 — London and New York. Stanford Ignite has been taught previously in Paris and Santiago as well as in Beijing and in Palo Alto, where the programme was launched in 2006.
Those programmes taught outside California rely on professors visiting from Stanford combined with lectures taught using videoconferencing technology. “I think we found a model for a remote immersive education experience,” says Stanford Ignite faculty director Yossi Feinberg.
Though professors often teach remotely, the local experience for participants is intensive and personal. “You need teams, you need mentoring,” says Prof Feinberg. “Part of any educational experience is that you create a trusted network.”
Once the class is accepted, participants submit ideas for ventures, the best of which are worked on by groups, alongside the lectures. These ventures form the backbone of the 10-week programme.
Prof Feinberg has high expectations for participants. “I expect everyone to start their own company or lead innovation in their [current] company,” he says. Stanford Ignite has a strong record: more than 100 successful companies have so far been started by participants on the programme.
In London, the programme will run in Canary Wharf and be hosted by Infosys — the IT company already hosts the programme in Bangalore. Stanford is accepting up to 50 students for the certificate programme, which will be taught in September 2015. It is aimed at participants with strong scientific, medical, or technical backgrounds who do not have an MBA or other advanced degree in business.

Loss of face for BJP  MLA caught watching Priyanka Gandhi on mobile phoneLeh, Kargil record season's coldest night, Srinagar at -5.4 C
In an embarrassment to Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a party MLA was caught on camera purportedly watching a zoomed in photo of Priyanka Gandhi on his mobile phone and other playing video games during proceedings of the Legislative Assembly here.
During video clippings telecast on local TV channels, MLA Prabhu Chavan was also shown watching photos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bollywood actor Riteish Deshmukh and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi along with Sonia Gandhi.
The Aurad legislator however courted controversy as he purportedly watched the zoomed in photo of Priyanka Gandhi.
Asked about his conduct, Chavan maintained he was flipping through pictures on mobile, including that of Modi.
When he came across a Priyanka Gandhi’s picture, he zoomed into it to read the slogan below. There was nothing objectionable in his zooming in the picture, he said.
“No no there was a slogan below, I was watching it, I can show you. I was watching slogan below (the photo).”
“By mistake I took it (phone) inside. I agree it is my mistake, but I have seen nothing with bad intention. I was checking photos of national leaders, I checked Narendra Modi photo…. I also checked my son’s photos….,” Chavan told reporters here.
“….nothing of that sort, taking it (mobile) inside is a mistake and I agree it was my mistake…,” he added.
Another BJP MLA U B Banakar was caught on camera playing online games on mobile phone oblivious of the discussion about the plight of sugarcane growers to whom sugar mill owners owe huge arrears.
The footage of both the MLAs seated separately was captured by a TV cameraman from the elevated media gallery and beamed by Kannada T V channels.
The incident involved the then Minister for Cooperation Laxman Savadi and Minister for Women and Child Development C C Patil with whom he shared it.
The legislature is holding the 10-day winter session here.

The Telecom Commission (TC) has recommended the base price for the upcoming spectrum auction, sources tell CNBC-TV18.
The commission is learnt to have recommended the base prices of 900 Mhz spectrum at Rs 3,693 crore per MHz, 1800 Mhz at Rs 2,191 crore and 800 Mhz for Rs 3,646 crore – higher than TRAI’s recommendation. However, it will re-examine the telecom regulator’s recommendation on E-GSM implementation.
Though the commission has agreed to a 30 percent discount on base price in Rajasthan for 1800 Mhz and 50 percent off (on base price) for the North-East area, it has said no to auction in Maharashtra and West Bengal for the 1800 Mhz band as partial spectrum is available, sources said.
The TC is also learnt to have deferred decision on spectrum return by BSNL and MTNL  and has taken note of Defence Ministry’s efforts to release 2100 Mhz band spectrum.
 
MTNL stock price
On January 02, 2015, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam closed at Rs 27.55, down Rs 0.1, or 0.36 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 39.10 and the 52-week low was Rs 13.76.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 134.30 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 0.21. The latest book value of the company is Rs 80.01 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 0.34.

States to get Rs 11 000 cr for cut in Central Sales Tax: FMArun Jaitley
(Jaitley's statement comes…)
NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley has announced the release of Rs 11,000 crore to states as compensation for the reduction in central sales tax to bridge the "trust deficit" between the Centre and the states and get them to support the proposed goods and services tax (GST).
The minister's statement comes ahead of his meeting with state finance ministers on Thursday to discuss the constitutional amendment bill required to facilitate GST , which seeks to replace multiple indirect taxes at central and state level with a single levy thus creating a common market. Jaitley also promised a "civilised" tax regime to attract overseas investments and pledged to meet the fiscal deficit target of 4.1% of GDP.
"One of the major reasons for this trust deficit is non-payment of the CST (central sales tax) compensation to the states from 2010 onwards... Despite a difficult and challenging situation, I propose to release about Rs 11,000 crore, which is one-third this year, as part payment of CST compensation to the states," Jaitley said, replying to the discussion on the supplementary demands for grants in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.
Jaitley said this will take care of the amount from 2010-11 onwards and the balance amount would be given from the next financial year, seeking the support of the house on the crucial indirect tax reform. "GST is not an issue on which we are divided on partisan lines. Most state governments are going to benefit.
The revenues are going to improve as far as the Centre is concerned, states are concerned and I wish to assure this House with this commitment," the finance minister said. The supplementary demands amount to additional expenditure of more than Rs 12,500 crore. However, the actual cash outgo would be Rs 500 crore. The demand was later passed by the House.While justifying the diffineed for a "civilised" tax regime, Jaitley took a dig at the previous government saying an "ultra-aggressive tax policy" has not helped in getting any additional revenue.He said retrospective tax changes by the previous United Progressive Alliance government had only brought a "bad name" to India rather than garner any additional revenue.
"We inherited an economic situation of negative sentiment, where none was willing to invest. There was reduced economic activity. The negative sentiment was further accelerated by (an) ultra-aggressive tax policy," he said.Referring to the select committee report on further opening the insurance sector, Jaitley said, "Large investments are waiting to come in. We have to open the doors."
The committee has suggested a composite foreign investment cap of 49% in the insurance sector, as against 26% foreign direct investment (FDI) cap currently. A composite limit allows portfolio investors as well, making the sector more attractive. He said the FDI regime has already been relaxed in the defence sector and this has generated a lot of interest from top global manufacturers.
On growth prospects, Jaitley said India faced challenges but hoped that these would be within the projected range of 5.4-5.9% in 2014-15 and cross 6% in the next financial year. Economic growth slowed below 5% in 2012-14, he said, adding this had an impact on revenue collection, the fiscal deficit and the government's expenditure on developmental works.
He said the government would meet the fiscal deficit target as this was important in terms of how India is perceived. "I am determined to maintain that because if we don't maintain that figure, the world and the global investors would look at us. Our rating is dependent on that. Alot depends on how the world views you."

No point in cutting rates till inflation cools: Credit Suisse | Rajan under pressure by MPsAbu Dhabi
(Credit Suisse's Neelkanth…)
Neelkanth Mishra, MD and India Strategist at Credit Suisse said a decline in crude oil prices and drop in current account surpluses in many oil exporting countries means that India will see slower fund flows going ahead. In an interview with ET's R Sriram & Biswajit Baruah, he said the RBI should look at inflationary expectations and till inflationary expectations don't come down there is no point cutting interest rates. Edited excerpts:
There has been a constant flow of good news recently including slide in oil prices, chances of fiscal deficit coming down, diesel price deregulation and so on. How do you read these headlines?
If you look at the decline in crude oil prices there are three implications — one is on the balance of payment, second is on the inflation, and third is on the fiscal numbers. Starting with the balance of payment the rule of thumb is $1 per barrel change in oil price affects the current account deficit (CAD) by about $1 billion a year. Thus, if there is a $20 decline in oil prices then there is a $20-billion impact on the current account deficit. As there is weak demand, it will hurt India's exports as well.
Further, capital flows get impacted, too — if you look at the sources of funds that invest in India, it's primarily the sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), the pension funds and the insurance funds. If Norway, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, or Kuwait are not going to see the kind of surpluses that they used to then they will have less capital to send out, which will mean that capital flows into India will not be as strong as they were. Thus, I do not think oil price fall will boost the currency or balance of payment situation.
Is there a possibility that inflation may bounce back early next year and hence interest rates are unlikely to come down in the near term?
My sense is that once the base effect is gone by December, we could see inflation rise again; this may not be to double digits or high single digits levels but to levels which will be more in line with the glide path that the RBI has given. The RBI should look at inflationary expectations and till inflationary expectations don't come down there is no point cutting interest rates because that has to be the target. And, for inflationary expectations to come down one should see sustained lower inflation for several months.
What are the prospects of investments picking up in the economy?
We see there are areas where investment growth will happen. It goes without saying that we need to invest more in water treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, metro rails, and so on. There is always some capex that's going on, but if you are looking from the perspective of what can really drive GDP growth then you have to look at the whole basket, and unfortunately that part is not moving.
The whole basket will not move till you have power, metal, rail and road capex starting to come through. These are the four massive chunks of our investment basket. And for the needle to really start moving at the economy level you need to have maybe 100 cities doing investments at the same time. That seems hard right now.
  Are Indian market valuations comparable to emerging markets index or BRIC Index?
If you look at India's price-to-earnings the most common push-back is whether India is cheap or expensive. MSCI India price-toearnings in comparison to MSCI Emerging Markets price-to-earnings is at a multiyear high, or that India versus Asia price to earnings is at four year high. But how is that really relevant?
If emerging markets' biggest weights Brazil, Mexico, Russia, China, and Korea are seeing problems, with each market having its own idiosyncrasy and growth suppressor how is that even comparable to India? So, I use MSCI World Index to compare with MSCI India and on that the price-to-earnings comparison has barely moved, because the move in Indian equity markets is more a reflection of global preference for equities. People say India is the best among BRICS, but that's no comparison at all.
FII flows have been at $17 billion this year, compared to a run rate of over $20 billion for the last two years. What is your outlook on global flows into India?
Thefall in oil prices and decline in current account surpluses in many oil exporting countries means that India will see slower flows. We may see a market-share gain in flows versus other economies. If you look at the eventual sources of funds — pension funds, insurance funds, sovereign wealth funds — I think most of them are under-invested in India. So, some amount of flows will keep happening but not at the quantum that we are used to.
What are your top picks in the current state of the economy right now?
If you are looking from a 12-month perspective, we are advising three 'buy' baskets and this is something we have been doing for a while now — one is wholesalefunded financials with good asset franchises, because as wholesale funding rates keep coming down companies that have a reasonable asset franchise will grow their earning profitably, and we are already seeing signs of that.
The second theme is exports and what we are saying is that with 45% reduction in value of the currency since 2011, there are opportunities in import substitution and exports. And on the services side we like IT, we still like pharma, and may be even two-wheelers.

#Express 5: Agra a blip  RSS to step up ghar wapsi  Relief for 1984 riotvictimsBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 8:33 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 8:49 am
We recommend that you go through Thursday’s top five stories of The Indian Express.
1. ‘GHAR WAPSI’- THE CONVERSION
RSS affiliate Bajrang Dal drew Opposition fire in Parliament Wednesday for converting 57 Muslim families to Hinduism in Agra but the Parivar fountainhead has already set in motion plans for an intensive ‘ghar wapsi’ — reconversion programme to raise what it calls the Hindu count in the next census.

2. 1984 ANTI-SIKH RIOTS
A month after it denied taking a decision on enhancing the compensation for the next of kin of the 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Tuesday wrote to the Finance Ministry seeking release of funds for disbursement during the current fiscal.

3. VADRA’S FIRMS
Addresses that are either inaccurate or don’t exist, shareholders who cannot be traced or are clueless about the companies, a mismatch between what’s on paper and what’s on the ground — such discrepancies mark the land transactions between Robert Vadra’s firms and three of the four companies that bought nearly 200 hectares from him.

4. OPINION
“The Ghazwa-e-Hind is inevitable,” announced Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, head of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), parent organisation of the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT). “Kashmir will be freed, 1971 will be avenged and the Gujarat victims will get justice, god willing.”

5. SPORTS
No one jumped around. No stumps were uprooted for souvenirs. No one from the dressing room charged out maniacally. As if, someone had forgotten to tell Jammu & Kashmir players that they had just beaten the 40-time Ranji champions. J&K’s quiet celebration told its own tale about the decline in Mumbai cricket and the spirit of J&K.

The market which staged a recovery of sorts on Wednesday may find the going tough at start.
 
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin is in India and will seek energy deals to overcome the slowdown in European consumption as Russia looks to export more Russian oil and gas to Asia. Putin and Modi are expected to jointly interact with CEOs of major companies from both the countries.
The market which staged a recovery of sorts on Wednesday may find the going tough at start. Brent crude touched a new five-year low of $63.56. Global cues are subdued and could pull the indices below the support of ~8300 levels.

Indians ask what has changed since Delhi gang rapeIndians ask what has changed since Delhi gang rape as Uber driver accused
By By Nita Bhalla | Reuters –  Tue 9 Dec, 2014

NEW DELHI: The alleged rape of a woman by a taxi driver in New Delhi, just days before the city marks the second anniversary of a notorious gang rape on a Delhi bus, has sparked debate over whether security for Indian women has improved.
A 27-year-old financial executive accused a taxi driver licensed by Uber, a popular U.S. online cab service, of raping her late on Friday as she travelled home from a party.
The alleged attack was a chilling reminder of the fatal gang rape of a woman by six assailants aboard a moving bus on Dec. 16, 2012. The crime sparked outrage around the world and calls for greater protections for women moving around India's cities.
"I think it is time for some introspection over what has changed in the last two years," said Kamala Bhasin, a prominent feminist who founded the women's rights charity Jagori.
"Laws have become better, there is greater public consciousness but we need to do much more in terms of addressing the question of why men are doing this and what can be done to stop them behaving like this."
The accused driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, was taken to court on Monday, a black cloth bag over his head. Police say he was arrested for raping a woman in 2011, but later acquitted.
Public outrage over the Delhi gang rape forced authorities to stiffen penalties against sex crime offenders and criminalise activities such as stalking. What is lacking is a strategy aimed at tackling patriarchal attitudes towards women, said activists.
India was ranked as the fourth most dangerous place for a woman to take public transport in a poll published in October by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. It polled second-worst on safety at night and for verbal harassment.
On average 40 cases of crimes against women are registered daily by Delhi Police, including at least four cases of rape, according to government officials.
MORE AWARENESS, MORE REPORTS
Over the last two years there has been voracious reporting on the issue and campaigns by the media and NGOs which have emboldened more victims to come forward to report crimes such as rape, molestation and sexual harassment.
The city's police force has established a women's help desk in most of the city's 160 police stations and conducts gender sensitisation classes for officers and constables. A toll-free women's helpline receives more than 250 calls daily.
Under a law introduced after the Delhi gang rape, police face up to three years in jail if they fail to register sexual offences - forcing them to take a "zero tolerance" approach to reports of gender crimes which often used to be dismissed.
Delhi Transport Corporation also conducts gender classes for its bus drivers and has begun fitting buses with GPS systems so that they are easy to monitor and locate.
Fast-track courts have been set up to deal with sex crimes and 'one-stop' rape centres have opened where victims can report the crime and access medical and psychological support.
"The registration of rape, molestation and other crimes against women has increased as an outcome of increased awareness of general public ... women are now feeling encouraged to come forward," Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, State Minister for Home Affairs, told parliament last week in a written reply.
There had been a 15 percent increase in the number of reports of crimes against women, with 13,230 reports registered in Delhi to Nov. 15 this year, against 11,479 cases during the corresponding period in 2013, added Chaudhary.
'DIFFERENT WORLD'
But activists say authorities can do much more.
"There is still a lot which needs to be done when it comes to safe mobility for women in the city," said Kalpana Viswanath, co-founder of Safetipin, an app which helps users by providing safety-related information.
"Delhi isn't an easy city to move around in ... We need better street lighting across the city and better last-mile connectivity services from metro stations."
More police deployed around metro stations, GPS in auto-rickshaws, extended hours for underground trains and more buses on the roads would also help, said activists.
Awareness campaigns, school classes on gender issues and training for those working in public transport were also needed.
"Banning tinted windows on buses, more police on the streets and better checks and monitoring on drivers are good outside measures," said Monica Kumar, head of Manas Foundation which has run gender classes for thousands of Delhi's rickshaw drivers.
"But we need inside measures. We need to understand their mindset and engage with such drivers, who are often migrants who come from a hugely different world where women are not respected and afforded their equal rights."

Gionee Marathon M3 review: Ready  to shift to a weekly recharge cyclePosted: December 9, 2014 1:27 pm | Updated: December 10, 2014 10:58 am
 
Gionee surely loves to create records. After making the world’s slimmest smartphones, Elife S5.5 and Elife S5.1, Gionee is now aiming to achieve the ‘smartphone with best battery life’ title with its Marathon M3 handset. This smartphone is powered by a 5,000 mAh battery and promises a month of standby battery backup. It can be used to charge other phones as well through OTG.  But can the Marathon M3 actually deliver its promise? Let’s check out.
Quick specs: Android 4.4.2 OS |  5-inch 720p IPS display | 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek MT 6582 CPU | 1GB RAM | 8GB internal memeory expandable up to 128 GB | 8MP rear camera| 2MP front camera | 5000 mAh battery
Price: Rs 12,999
Design: Gionee has totally focused on delivering good battery life, maybe at the cost of design. The Marathon M3 looks like any another smartphone in the sub Rs 15,000 price category. The 5-inch smartphone is easy to hold, but  at 180 grams it is a bit heavy thanks to the massive 5000 mAh battery. The build quality is good. The back cover, which can be removed, hides two SIM card slots, a microSD card slot and a reset button. The battery cannot be removed. This is not a slim device by any stretch of your imagination.
Display: The Marathon M3 features a 5-inch 720p IPS display at a pixel density of 294 ppi. Overall, the display is decent. However, at full brightness, the colours were not accurate and a bit more whitish. Outdoor visibility is average and you might have to put the screen at maximum brightness under direct sunlight to operate the device. The viewing angles are good.
Performance: The phone comes with an average spec sheet. The 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek MT 6582 with 1GB RAM scored an average 17708 on AnTuTu Benchmark (v5.3). The overall experience was not all that smooth. I witnessed ghost touches (touches with no response), app crashes and sometimes I had to make an extra effort to literally pull down the notification panel.
Keeping these flaws aside, the phone performed well while doing regular stuff. Heavy games like Dead Trigger 2, Dead Target, Gunship Battle and Blood and Glory worked smoothly. So, the hardware doesn’t disappoint on the gaming front.
The Multi-media performance is surprisingly good. I watched several movies through the OTG without any lag at all. The speaker is loud and audio quality is decent at this price.
The phone runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat operating system with Gionee’s custom UI. The notification panel includes a lot of handy shortcuts and users will mostly like the UI.  Overall, the performance is satisfactory, however, be prepared for some occasional glitches.
Camera: The 8MP camera does a decent job at normal lighting. However, low light images produced a lot of grains. The camera is capable of capturing good macro shots. Low light HDR shots produced good colours but grainy. The front 2 MP camera is continued…

NEW DELHI: Former India hockey captain Viren Rasquinha was in for a rude shock during the Times Lit Fest in Mumbai when he was mocked by self-styled socialite Suhel Seth questioning what the Arjuna awardee was doing on the sports panel of the festival.
After Viren Rasquinha was done speaking, Suhel Seth stepped on the stage insulting the former India hockey player saying: 'Don't know what that bald guy was doing on a panel on sport, whats he done.'
Following the insult, Viren Rasquinha took to Twitter to let know people about the abusive Suhel Seth and his disappointment.

Rasquinha is the COO of the Olympic Gold Quest, which support Indian athletes in their mission to win Olympic gold medals.
Suhel Seth was however quick to apologise about the incident.

VAT row: Odisha traders stop import of fooditemsCommodities see longest losing streak in 23 years
Protesting against high VAT rates, over 2,200 wholesale traders in Odisha have stopped importing pulses and wheat products from other states beginning Tuesday for an indefinite period.
They were agitating under the banner All Odisha Traders’ Association (AOTA). The state’s main business point Malgodown in Cuttack remained closed on Tuesday.
The traders’ body has been demanding for introduction of a unitary tax system on food products in the state instead of the 5% VAT levied on these items, which are exempted in 23 other states in the country.
Traders had been time and again complaining against the high VAT rate on food products in Odisha, which they claimed had led to rampant black marketing of these items by unscrupulous traders.
“As many as 23 states in the country have no VAT on pulses and food grains,” said AOTA general secretary Sudhakar Panda. fe Bureau

Meet Afghanistan s Bruce Lee who has taken the internet by stormMeet Afghanistan's Bruce Lee who has taken the internet by storm

From the ruins of a bombed-out palace above Kabul, a young Afghan man bearing a striking resemblance to kung fu legend Bruce Lee is high-kicking his way to internet fame, aiming to show another side to his war-weary nation.
Videos and photos of Abbas Alizada, 20, posted on the Facebook page "Bruce Hazara" show him performing back flips and striking Lee's famous poses. They blazed through Afghanistan's small Internet community this week, part of a publicity burst he hopes will catapult him to broader fame.
"I want to be a champion in my country and a Hollywood star," Alizada said at Kabul's desolate Darulaman palace, where he trains twice a week, swirling nunchakus and sporting a Lee-like bowl haircut.

At a workout at the palace, adorned with photos of thousands of civilian war victims as part of a protest exhibition, Alizada showed off his wiry physique, doing push-ups on his fingertips and sparring with a partner. Two assistants dabbed his brow and fixed his hair for the cameras.
Alizada is from a poor family of 10 children. His parents could not afford the fees at an academy of Wushu, a Chinese mixed martial art, but the trainer took him under his wing. Darulaman palace, built in the 1920s by King Amanullah Khan, was damaged by decades of fighting for control of the capital.
It is now a ruin pocked by artillery craters and bullet holes, overlooking an as-yet-unfinished national parliament building. "The destruction here makes me sad, but it also inspires me," said Alizada, who refused to be filmed in one room where the walls were daubed with graffiti reading "death to Americans".
He rejects the name Bruce Hazara given to him by friends in recognition of his ethnic heritage, saying he prefers to be known as the Afghan Bruce Lee in a country riven by tribal divides.
Questions of national unity are poignant in Afghanistan, where Taliban insurgents are flexing their muscles with near-daily attacks. This year has been the bloodiest of the war, as foreign troops drastically reduce their presence.
Alizada's recent success on the internet and at a martial arts tournament in Kabul reflects some of the changes in the country since the US-led intervention toppled the Taliban after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
Helped by the spread of TV and the internet, Afghanistan has witnessed a rapid rise in interest in sports under the government that succeeded the hardline Islamists, who had banned television and many sports and martial arts.
"The only news that comes from Afghanistan is about war ... I am happy that my story is a positive one," Alizada said.

Putin-Modi Summit to focus on nuclear energy and oilBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 10, 2014 3:38 pm | Updated: December 10, 2014 4:34 pm
Expansion of ties in a range of crucial sectors like nuclear energy, hydrocarbons and defence will be in focus when Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi deliberate at the annual summit here on December 10 with an aim to further strengthen the already close strategic partnership.
In his talks with Modi, both in restricted and delegation level formats, Putin is likely to seek deeper economic engagement with the “time-tested” ally to negate affect of sanctions against Russia by the US and its Western allies over the Ukraine issue.
Both sides are looking at inking 15-20 pacts following the summit which has been taking place since 2000 alternately in Moscow and New Delhi.
Ahead of his visit, Putin termed ties with India as “privileged strategic partnership” and said construction of new nuclear plants besides military and technical cooperation was high on the agenda for talks. He said Russia was keen to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India and involve ONGC in oil and gas hunt in the Arctic.
Energy-starved India, which is the third largest oil importer after the US and China — has been pushing for greater involvement in major gas and oil exploration projects in Russia and both the leaders are set to discuss the issue.
Russia is one of the top oil producers globally and has huge reserves of natural gas.
In the nuclear energy sector, Russia may offer to set up a total of 20-24 nuclear energy production units in India against previously agreed 14-16 plants. Both sides are also likely to come out with a roadmap for cooperation in the overall energy sector.
Russian Ambassador Alexander Kadakin said the two countries will start negotiations for setting up of units five and six at the Kudankulam nuclear power complex soon and may sign a technical pact for units 3 and 4 during Putin’s stay here.
Russia was awaiting India’s decision to allot a site for construction of a new Russian-designed nuclear power plant and the issue may figure in the talks.
Putin will be accompanied by around 15 business tycoons from Russia and both Modi and the Russian President are expected to jointly interact with CEOs of major companies from both the countries as enhancing trade ties will be a major item on the agenda of the summit.
The volume of bilateral trade was USD 10 billion in 2013 and both sides feel there was “huge opportunity” to improve it significantly. India has been working to have a trade pact with “Eurasian space” for improved trade and commerce which will also improve trade with Russia.
India’s exports, particularly food items, to Russia have gone up since sanctions were imposed against that country by Western nations for its interventions in the crisis in Ukraine.
India has been maintaining that it cannot be party to any economic sanctions against Russia.
Both the leaders are continued…

Akula appointed chairman of financial inclusion start-up Vaya FinservAkula appointed chairman of financial inclusion start-up Vaya Finserv
BS Reporter | Hyderabad Dec 11, 2014 12:49 AM IST
Vikram Akula, founder and former chairperson of SKS Microfinance, has been appointed chairman of financial inclusion start-up Vaya Finserv Private Limited.  Akula will also take a 26 per cent stake in Vaya for an undisclosed amount.
Vaya is a business correspondent (BC), which facilitates savings and loans for self-help groups of women on behalf of banks.
The company was founded by former SKS executives and opened its first branch in July. It has 23 branches with 183 employees across six districts of eastern Maharashtra and northern Karnataka. It has so far disbursed loans of Rs 7.5 crore.
 
“Now that my three-year non-compete period is over, I was looking to get back to financial inclusion,” said Akula.
“I chose to join Vaya because it is focused on under-banked districts, it has a great team, and it uses a next-generation technology platform that will become the future of financial inclusion.”
Akula told Business Standard the deal was expected to be closed in a week and he intended to play a non-executive role in the BC confining his involvement to strategic aspects.
According to Akula, Vaya is intending to apply for a bank licence by January 16. “I think both the creation of small banks and payments banks is an extremely progressive step on the part of the Reserve Bank of India, and this will certainly help enhance financial inclusion. We are working with our advisors on preparing a small bank licence application,” he said.
Akula said while Vaya has a robust plan to grow as a BC,  a small bank licence would assist it in furthering financial inclusion by providing loans to small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and other unorganised sector entities. “We also have an option to apply for a payments bank licence,” he added.
Vaya is stated to be the first BC to use tablet banking in the field. The field officers use tablets to connect to a centralised online system that has the ability to interface seamlessly with core banking systems, to ensure daily cash settlement with partner banks.
“We have the advantage of not having any legacy systems, so we could design a bank compliant process and system framework right from the outset,” said Surya Kumar, managing director of Vaya. Kumar used to serve as the head of technology at SKS.
As soon as the regulator permits inter-operability for mobile payments, Kumar said, Vaya would be able to offer its customers the convenience of a mobile banking platform, similar to what was in place in countries like Kenya and the Philippines.
In terms of strategy, Vaya is focused on under-banked areas. “We rely on RBI data on under-banked districts and our expansion strategy is to fill those gaps,” said Kumar.
 
Aside from Akula, other investors in Vaya include individual high-net investors, the SKS Trusts and Vaya employees.

Furniture retailer Ikea to double sourcing from India by 2020

(World's largest furniture…)
NEW DELHI: World's largest furniture retailer Ikea on Wednesday announced a new initiative "Make More in India" as it plans to double its sourcing from the country to about 630 million euro by 2020. "The initiative is aimed at potential suppliers and to expand Ikea's supplier base as well as the categories of home furnishing products sourced in India. Ikea today sources for 315 million euro and plans to double the sourcing by 2020," the company said.
"We believe there is tremendous potential in India. We are looking for new suppliers who share our vision and values, are willing to grow with us and become world class suppliers," Ikea South Asia head of sourcing Sandeep Sanan said.
At present, Ikea has 48 suppliers in India with 45,000 direct employees and about 400,000 people in its extended supply chain. As part of this initiative, Ikea India will conduct two seminars — in Mumbai and Bangalore where more than 100 new potential suppliers are likely to participate.
The seminars will focus on enrolling new suppliers in existing categories like textiles and rugs; as well as for new home furnishing categories like furniture, mattresses, and sustainable materials like bamboo and acacia; and also growing suppliers for categories like metal, plastics, and lighting, the company said. In September, Ikea said it plans to invest Rs 12,500 crore to set up 25 stores in the country over the next decade. The new storeswill come in the cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bangalore.

Debt funds  exposure to G-Sec hits 11-month high on rate cut hopesDebt funds' exposure to G-Sec hits 11-month high on rate cut hopes
Chandan Kishore Kant | Mumbai Dec 10, 2014 10:48 PM IST
The country’s fixed-income fund managers are seen loading on government securities (G-secs). The latter are seeing a sharp rally, in anticipation of a reversal in the Reserve Bank's monetary policy stance. G-secs accounted for nearly 10 per cent of total assets under management (AUM) in debt last month, the highest in 11 months.
Mutual fund (MF) exposure to government paper rose from 6.24 per cent of AUM in March to 9.87 per cent last month. The gradual increase in exposure coincides with a drop in yields, from 9.1 per cent in April to below 7.9 per cent at present. In absolute terms, G-sec holdings at MFs was Rs 77,870 crore in November of the total debt AUM of Rs 7.89 lakh crore.
Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. A fall in yields boosts the return for debt schemes, as it results in capital appreciation. “G-secs have already rallied a lot. Yields have fallen more than 50 basis points in the past three months. But there can further downward movement if interest rates are eased,” said Akhil Mittal, senior fund manager (fixed income) at Tata MF.
A global drop in oil and commodity prices has raised expectation that interest rates and, thus, G-sec yields could be headed downward for the long term.
“The drop in international oil prices will benefit all oil importing countries, especially India. The decline in consumer inflation appears sustainable, given the long-drawn pricing cycle of commodities. Benign inflation over the next few years will lead to lower interest rates in the future,” said Sujoy Das, head of fixed income, Religare Invesco MF.
Most fund managers have been opting for longer duration debt paper, as these are likely to benefit the most from a reversal in the monetary policy stance. Fund managers say fixed-income products with high duration — between three and five years — are poised to benefit the most. Interestingly, about 90 per cent of the G-sec investments are in papers with maturity of more than a year.
“Investors should consider investing in long-duration gilt and income funds to benefit from falling interest rates over the next few years,” said Das.
Fund managers have been advising investors to add duration to their existing investments in debt products. According to them, from a six-month to 18-month perspective, fixed income products can deliver double-digit returns.
“We continue to run high-duration debt across schemes and believe the time is right for investors to continue building duration in their portfolios,” said Rahul Goswami, chief investment officer, fixed income, ICICI Prudential AMC.
“Since over time the curve is expected to steepen, products like short-term plans and credit funds like corporate bond funds, focused on the medium duration, are also very attractive.”
November saw a rise of about six per cent in gilt funds investors' base to 54,487 over October. The period saw gross sales of Rs 1,236 crore. As on end-November, the MF sector offered 46 gilt funds to investors.

Richard Rahul Verma confirmed as US Ambassador to IndiaRichard Rahul Verma confirmed as US Ambassador to India

Richard Rahul Verma was on Wednesday unanimously confirmed as the next US Ambassador to India by the US Senate, making him the first-ever Indian-American to hold the post.
Verma's nomination was approved by the Senate by a voice vote, reflecting a sense of bi-partisan support to the Indo-US ties and showing his popularity among Senators across the aisle.
The US Senate raced through his nomination process ahead of more than 50 ambassadorial nominations to make sure that he is in the national capital when US President Barack Obama visits India to be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade on January 26.
Verma, who quietly played an important role in the US Congressional passage of civil nuclear deal with the country, had advocated for strong Indo-US ties when in the administration and recently started India 2020 project at Centre for American Progress - a top US think tank.
The 46-year-old will replace Nancy Powell, who resigned in March after a damaging row over the treatment of diplomat Devyani Khobragade over visa fraud charges.
The US Embassy in the national capital is currently headed by charge d'affaires Kathleen Stephens.
Verma is currently a senior counsellor at Steptoe & Johnson law firm and the Albright Stonebridge Group - a business advisory company led by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
Verma's association with Obama goes back to 2008 when he worked on presidential debate preparations for the then Illinois senator. His parents came to the US in the early 1960s.
Verma's confirmation as US Ambassador to India is a huge victory for the US-India strategic partnership. That he was confirmed by a voice vote by the US Senate is a potent demonstration of the high esteem in which both he and the bilateral relationship are held by both parties in Washington, Ronak D Desai, an academic at Harvard University's India and South Programme, told PTI.
As the US President prepares to make his second trip to the country in January, Obama is fortunate to have Rich Verma at the helm of the Embassy in the national capital. He will prove instrumental in navigating US foreign relations with India to the new, unexplored heights, Desai said.

Financial planning is the way to goInvest in a way that you have enough resources during tough times

Hemant Rustagi is CEO, Wiseinvest Advisors.
In today's complex financial environment it is crucial for all of us to plan our investments in such a way that we have adequate financial resources at critical junctures of our life. Yet majority of investors invest haphazardly and put their hard-earned money at risk. While there are many who invest quite conservatively, there are also those who invest aggressively, completely ignoring their risk profile and needs.
Both these approaches expose them to different types of risks. While ultra-conservative investors end up compromising on their long-term goals as their portfolios fail to keep pace with inflation, the aggressive investors often make irrational investment decisions in their pursuit for that ever-eluding financial windfall.  
Therefore, if you are in the process of working out your investment strategy, you must adopt one that helps you design a portfolio that suits your requirements without exposing you to unnecessary risk. Remember, asset allocation strategy i.e. investing in different asset classes based on your time horizon, goals and risk-taking capacity is one such strategy that allows you to keep your risk within your risk-taking ability.
Since investing money judiciously is becoming more and more challenging, having a financial plan in place can ensure that you allocate appropriate sums for your different needs and requirements. Simply put, financial planning can help you make informed investment decisions by having an appropriate risk-reward balance in the portfolio.
There are certain basic requirements for financial planning such as defining and setting quantifiable goals, incorporating risk management, understanding the effect of each financial decision and being realistic in terms of expectations.
Define goals
All of us have goals that we would like to achieve over short, medium and long-term. To ensure that all your efforts are directed in a focused manner, you must begin the process by establishing your goals. Once the goals are established, you must assign a time horizon to each of these goals and quantify them. By setting a target for each of your goals and assuming a rate of return based on the proposed asset allocation, you can work out the amount that needs to be invested to achieve these goals. While starting your investment process early and in the right manner is important, it is equally important to monitor its progress. Therefore, it helps if you create a separate portfolio for each of your goals. This will ensure your complete control over your goals and the progress made towards achieving them at all times.
Make risk management your priority
Risk management should be an integral part of your financial plan. However, we often ignore this important aspect of financial planning process. In fact, even those investors who do alright in terms of their investment process often ignore risk management. This can be quite risky as it is critical to cover risks relating to your life, health and property. Therefore, before starting your investment process, you must ensure that these risks are adequately covered. Remember, buying the right insurance policy is equally important.
For example, paying higher premium for a traditional life insurance policy often makes you compromise on the quantum of risk cover as well as investment returns. A term insurance plan scores over traditional and unit linked insurance plans, both in terms of quantum of insurance cover as well as costs. Therefore, it is always advisable to separate your insurance and investment needs.
Besides, creating an emergency fund equivalent to your six months expenses is also a crucial part of risk management. This emergency fund ensures that your investment process would not get disturbed when you are faced with some financial exigency. Also, don't forget to review your risk management process periodically to further reduce risk.  
Select your investment options well
You must start short-listing your investment options only after deciding on appropriate asset allocation . The emphasis should be on investment options that are transparent, flexible and tax efficient. In fact, market linked products should be the mainstay of your portfolio as they have the potential to provide higher returns than traditional instruments like fixed deposits and bonds etc.  An investment vehicle like mutual funds fits the bill and hence they should be the mainstay of your portfolio. Mutual funds allow you to invest in different asset classes through a variety of funds.
However, the key is to select your funds well within each asset class. For example, while investing in equity funds, your focus should primarily be on well diversified funds. Investing in aggressive funds like sector, thematic and specialty funds at the start of your portfolio building process can expose you to higher volatility which can create doubts in your mind about the asset class and the utility of this wonderful investment vehicle.
Many investors make the mistake of relying on past performance alone while selecting funds. If you have been following this approach, you need to rethink your strategy. Although, past performance is an important aspect in the decision making process, relying too much on it can backfire.  Even while considering the past performance, the focus has to be on the long-term performance rather than the short term one.  
    
For example, in a current market like situation, mid-cap funds or funds having higher exposure to mid-cap stocks, sector and thematic funds dominate the list of top performing funds. A strategy of investing a significant part of your equity investments into these funds can make it too aggressive for your liking and that may at times compel you to make haphazard investment decisions.  
Similarly, a performance analysis of equity and equity oriented funds during market downturns would project a disappointing picture. Relying on past performance alone during such times would make it difficult to invest in equities.  Hence, you must look beyond past performance to make sound investment decisions.
In keeping with that, factors such as the need to maintain your asset allocation, potential of equities to beat inflation as well as out-perform other asset classes in the long run, might provide convincing reasons to make fresh allocations.
Stay committed to your asset allocation
While a goal-based investment approach can help a great detail in ensuring that you invest with a clear time horizon and avoid making abrupt changes in the portfolio, maintaining asset allocation by rebalancing the portfolio periodically ensures that you remain invested in different asset classes at all times in the proportion that suits your risk profile.  As a result, you neither miss out on sudden rallies in the market nor expose your portfolio to too much risk during market downturns.                            

Putin visit: Indian  Russian energy firms to ink pactsONGC, Essar, OIL to sign agreements with Rosneft, Zarubezhneft
New Delhi, December 10:  
With Russian President Vladimir Putin visiting today, public sector oil and gas producer Oil India Ltd is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding with Russia’s Zarubezhneft for exploration opportunities in the hydrocarbon sector.
Separately, private sector player Essar and public sector major ONGC will sign agreements with Russian extraction and refinement company Rosneft.
While Oil India and ONGC’s pacts will be for enhancing hydrocarbons opportunities, Essar will be inking a pact to source crude oil from Russia.
While Indian refineries want crude oil at affordable prices, Russia is renewing its ties with India following sanctions by the West over the Ukraine crisis. Between April and October this fiscal year, India bought 0.34 million tonnes of oil from Russia.
Oil India has done business with Russia in the past. Earlier this year, the PSU explorer had acquired a 50 per cent participating interest in an onshore block in Russia, where Petroneft Resources is the operator. The acreage started production on January 1 and the current production share net to Oil India is 1,050 barrels of oil per day.
During President Putin’s visit, another agreement between ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of ONGC, and Russia’s Rosneft is expected to firm up OVL’s stake in the Vankor oilfields in Eastern Siberia.
In addition, Russia has offered OVL an opportunity to jointly develop the Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye oilfield, also in eastern Siberia.

After buffalo meat  Russia opens doors to milk  dairy products from IndiaAfter buffalo meat, Russia opens doors to milk, dairy products from India
Amiti Sen
Western sanctions over Ukraine force Moscow to lift restrictions
New Delhi, December 10:  
Russia has lifted restrictions on the import of milk, cheese and other dairy products from India less than a week after allowing buffalo meat from the country.
“Last week it was buffalo meat and this week it is dairy products. We are glad that Moscow has resolved the issues related to quality certification of Indian meat and dairy products speedily,” a Commerce Ministry official told BusinessLine.
This move is a result of Western sanctions on Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis, which led to Russia not buying food items from the EU, US, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are likely to announce a Joint Study Group for a feasibility study on a Free Trade Agreement between the two countries, which would boost trade further.
Exporters are excited about the opportunities that Russia holds as India’s exports to the country during the last fiscal year were just $2.15 billion, a small fraction of Russia’s total imports of $318 billion.
“We are in a position to export dairy items worth $400 million in the first year itself. It is likely to go up several fold subsequently,” said Ajay Sahai, Director-General and CEO of FIEO.
Amul is already exploring opportunities to enter the Russian market and is in talks with Russian company Galaktika for export of cheese and dried milk.
Processing units inspected and certified by Russia’s Ministry of Agriculture can export their products to the country.
With Russia now formally allowing import of dairy items, more such partnerships will follow.
There are hopes that restrictions on poultry products and egg powder will also be removed soon as the Russian Government has indicated its interest.
“Russia imports more than $40 billion worth of food items from Western countries, and a large chunk of that business can gradually come to India,” the Commerce Ministry official said.

Govt drops attempted suicide as a crime; legal breather for SharmilaGovt drops attempted suicide as a crime; hope for Sharmila
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 10, 2014

The Centre has decided to decriminalise attempt to suicide in a move which will ensure that people who try to take their own lives do not end up behind bars if they survive.

“Eighteen states and four Union Territory administrations have supported that Section 309 of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) may be deleted. Keeping in view the responses, it has been decided to delete the section from the statute book,” minister of state for home affairs Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary told the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.
Section 309 prescribes a jail term of up to one year for those convicted of attempting suicide.
Hope for Sharmila as govt de-criminalises ‘attempt to suicide’
The move potentially paves the way for the release of rights activist Irom Sharmila , who has been on hunger strike for the past 14 years.
Sharmila has been protesting against army atrocities in Manipur. She has been under detention throughout her fast, and is force-fed by tubes several times a day.
Six years ago, the law commission had recommended against treating attempt to suicide as a criminal act, calling it unreasonable to punish a person who overcomes the instinct of self-preservation and tries to end own life.
The Supreme Court had decriminalised suicide in 1994, holding that people had the right to kill themselves. But the offence was restored two years later after a person, prosecuted for abetment, argued that he had merely assisted the victim to die.
The previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had proposed a bill to remove the offence from the statute but was advised to bring an overarching bill rather than a piecemeal approach.
Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Sikkim were among the few states that had opposed the recommendation when the previous UPA government started the process of consultations.
This bill is now being finalised by the home ministry.
Soli Sorabjee, a top Indian lawyer, welcomed the government's decision, saying that a suicide attempt is a manifestation of a person's condition of mind, deserving of treatment and not punishment.
Suicides have been on the rise in India, where thousands of farmers who are unable to pay back loans end their lives every year. The loans - from banks and loan sharks - are often used by farmers to buy seed and farm equipment, or to pay large dowries to get their daughters married. But a bad harvest can put a farmer deeply in debt.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed India as one of the countries with the highest suicide rates - 21.1 per 100,000 people in 2012.
The government said 134,799 people committed suicide in 2013 -- 15 every hour, a rise of 11.9% over the previous year. Family problems and illness accounted for nearly 44% of the cases. The Centre, however, does not track the number of attempted suicides.
More than 800,000 people each year worldwide commit suicide -- around one person every 40 seconds, WHO said in September.

Now  a petition says Lingaa story similar to Telugu filmUpdated: December 10, 2014 09:03 IST
Now, a petition says Lingaa story similar to Telugu film
Vivek Narayanan

The much awaited Rajinikanth starrer, Lingaa, has run into yet another controversy with a producer claiming in the Madras High Court that the story is a copy of a Telugu film.
Kartheeka, representing M/s Balaji Studios Private Ltd., Saligramam, Chennai, said that in 2010, the firm purchased the story rights to remake a Telugu film, Indra, starring Chiranjeevi and Sonali Bendre.
The petitioner said the storyline of Indra was about a hero who makes a lot of sacrifice, including losing his property, and leaves his village so that a reservoir is built. But he returns to take revenge on those who had killed his family members.
The petitioner alleged that the main storyline of this film was copied by Lingaa director K.S. Ravikumar and the production company. She urged the High Court to restrain the production house from releasing the movie till the copyright infringement issue is sorted out in the court.
However, Mr. Ravikumar, denied the allegations. He said it was open to every story writer to invent any story in respect of any reservoir or dam.
Justice R. Subbiah refused to stay the release of the movie and adjourned the matter to December 12.
Meanwhile, Mr. Ravikumar filed a counter in the city civil court in response to a case filed by P. Sakthivel, who claimed that Lingaa’s storyline was copied from the script of his movie, Uyir Anai, based on the life of Colonel John Pennycuick, a British engineer behind the construction of the Mullaperiyar dam.
In his counter, Mr. Ravikumar said the life of Pennycuick was not anyone’s personal property. The case has been adjourned to December 11.

Higher foreign cap in insurance is insuredIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
Fourteen years after India permitted 26% foreign investment in the insurance sector and ending years of political wrangling over a proposal to enhance the limit, the under-performing industry seems poised to raise the much-needed growth capital. A parliamentary panel report, tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, proposed a 49% composite cap — including foreign direct and portfolio investments — in the sector, with a tighter definition of “control” to strengthen the hands of Indian investors.
Though the Left parties and the Trinamool Congress continued to bicker, a larger consensus was indeed emerging among other major parties after a select committee on the Insurance Law (Amendment) Bill, 2008, produced its report after extensive deliberations.
The Cabinet approved the Bill later in the day.
The 15-member committee was set up in August after the Narendra Modi government failed to gather the requisite parliamentary support for the Bill, given its lack of majority in the Rajya Sabha. With the current breakthrough, the Bill is most likely to be passed in both Houses of Parliament in the current session. The government — looking at ways to revive investor sentiment by pushing difficult reforms — is likely to move the Bill for passage by the 245-member Upper House next week itself, sources said.
The select committee took note of concerns over FDI merely replacing domestic capital and said: “The committee is also of the view that incremental equity should ideally be used for expansion of capital base so as to strengthen the insurance sector.”
The capital requirement of the Indian insurance industry is estimated at $12 billion by 2020; the select panel noted needs of R55,000 crore over the next five years. Foreign capital of around $3 billion could be infused immediately after the investment cap is hiked, analysts said.
Most of the domestic insurance companies, including some that already have foreign partners, are keen to expand their capital base.
In some cases, of course, the foreign investor may merely be buying the equity that the domestic entities are looking to offload.
The hike in foreign investment limit in insurance will lead to a similar increase in the respective cap in the pension sector as the relevant law — the PFRDA Act — mandates that the foreign holding in pension sector will be the same as insurance. Higher FDI will also help insurance firms fetch better valuations in their initial public offerings. Expansion of the insurance industry would help catalyse savings into investments, rather than them getting locked up in relatively illiquid assets like gold.
Insurance stocks closed at 5.4% higher on Wednesday. Shares of Max India jumped 5.34%, Reliance Capital rose 4.34% and Aditya Birla Nuvo gained 0.71% on the BSE.
Foreign insurance companies having operations in the country through joint ventures with domestic firms include Netherlands-based Aegon, Canada’s Sun Life Financial, Italy’s Generali, Prudential and Nippon Life Insurance. All of them are believed to have expansion plans in the country and other are planning to enter.
Deepak Haria, senior director, Deloitte India, said: “If the Bill is passed by Parliament, it will help receive new funding and resources for existing players, and hopefully open up opportunities for new players into the Indian market. Many international firms have expressed interest in entering the market. Also, this will strengthen the long-term ambition for increasing financial inclusion in India.”
Life insurance penetration in India stood at a dismal 3.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of total premiums underwritten in a year, much lower than more than 10% in Japan and nearly 6% in Australia. Overall insurance penetration had declined to 3.96% of GDP in 2012 from 4.1% in 2011. Life insurance penetration had slipped from 3.4% in 2011, while non-life insurance penetration increased marginally from 0.7% in 2011 to 0.78% in 2012.
Ever since the insurance sector was opened up by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government in 2000, as many as 23 new life insurers and 24 general insurance have entered the sector.
The select committee said although the growth rates of various segments of the Indian insurance industry after foreign investment was allowed were below expectations, a hike in the foreign investment limit was indeed in order given the paucity of capital.
It recommended that the paid-up equity capital requirements be retained at Rs 100 crore so that health insurers have adequate capacity to provide critical services to citizens, adding that utmost priority should be accorded to this segment. Rejecting suggestions that paid-up equity capital in this segment be reduced to Rs 50 crore, it said such a move will encourage non-serious players to enter the field. It also recommended that the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority frame adequate regulations to facilitate the entry of multinational insurance brokers who can provide an impetus to the country’s insurance and reinsurance sectors. Foreign insurance cap could, however, be kept at 26% for insurance cooperative societies, the committee said.
Irda in December 2011 stipulated that only life insurers that have completed 10 years of operations will be allowed to go public. The regulator also said that an insurance firm should have “embedded value” twice the paid-up equity capital.
As per current norms, “foreign investment by way of FDI, investment by FIIs/FPIs and NRIs” of up to 26% is permitted in the sector under the automatic route. In his 2014-15 Budget speech, finance minister Arun Jaitley had said the composite foreign investment cap of the insurance sector is proposed to be increased to 49% with full Indian management and control through the FIPB route.
Stating that whether FDI limit is 26% or 49% hardly alter “ownership” and “control”, the select committee said control must be defined in the Insurance Act itself, rather than under the FDI policy as at present. “The term ‘control’ shall include the right to appoint a majority of the directors or to control the management or policy decisions including by virtue of their shareholding or management rights or shareholder agreements or voting agreements,” it said.
Insurance firms welcomed the select committee’s proposal on foreign investment.
“We already have 26% foreign capital from the Sanlam Group and once Parliament allows 49% foreign investment, we will increase it further,” Manoj Jain, CEO of Shriram Life Insurance, said. According to Rajesh Sud, CEO & managing director, Max Life Insurance, additional inflows of foreign capital will allow for greater investment in product and distribution and hence increased penetration of life insurance in the country. Echoing this view, Tarun Chugh, MD & CEO, PNB MetLife, said: “FDI not only brings in capital and foreign exchange immediately into the economy but also enables companies to invest further in managerial ability, technical knowledge, administrative organisation, and innovations in products and production techniques.”
Earlier in 2011, the standing committee headed by former finance minister Yashwant Sinha had rejected the proposal to hike FDI to 49% in the insurance sector, saying it may not have the desired effect and could expose the economy to global vulnerability.
Meanwhile, P Rajeev (CPI-M), KC Tyagi (JDU) and Ram Gopal Yadav (SP), in a dissent note to the report of the select committee on the insurance Bill, said: “The further hike in FDI may not be in the interest of the Indian insurance sector and the economy and against the interest of policyholders.” The members said they could not find any link between increasing FDI and increasing penetration of insurance.
Separately, TC member Derek O’Brien in his dissent note said, “An increase in FDI is neither necessary nor expedient. Therefore I strongly suggest that the limit for foreign investment in the insurance be retained at 26% and that the portfolio investment should be under no circumstances be permitted.”

Narendra Modi to take up NTPCs Barh project with Vladimir PutinIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
The delay in the commissioning of NTPC’s R10,000-crore-Barh-I power project in Bihar, where Russian company TPE is a contractor, will figure prominently in the talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.
Given the upcoming Bihar polls, the Modi government wants see early commissioning of the project, which has been delayed by three years due to slow work by TPE, a power equipment supplier fully owned by the Russian government. Sources said TPE has told NTPC it will be able to complete the project in 2017 only. The Indian power generator is in favour of changing the contractor so that pending work could be fast-tracked.
Meanwhile, government sources said TPE has raised extra financial claim of $ 248 million on Indian power generator, which is on top of the $190 million paid to it in 2010 towards increased inputs costs. And to put pressure on the PSU for early settlement of additional claims, the contractor is going slow on execution work. But government sources said NTPC has refused to entertain TPE’s demand, saying it is beyond the scope of the contract. The PSU has also drawn the government’s attention to repeated shifting of commissioning dates by TPE.
NTPC sources said the company has already served termination notice to TPE. However, the same has been kept on hold so that the dispute could be taken up for resolution at the diplomatic level. The matter is being taken up under the India Russia Inter-governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation.
Significantly, NTPC’s Barh-I project continues to languish even as the Barh-II project, which was conceived by the state-owned entity much later and where Indian equipment supplier BHEL was the contractor, has already started operations.

Govt working on boosting economys productivityIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
The Modi government is working on measures to “dramatically improve” productivity of the economy and people that would help achieve a sustainable growth rate of 7-8%, making India a $5-trillion economy in 12 years, MoS for finance Jayant Sinha said. Addressing the Delhi Economic Conclave organised by the finance ministry, he said the government was working on four areas to achieve this goal, that includes steps regarding macroeconomic stability, creating world class infrastructure, improving ease of doing business, unlocking entrepreneurial energy and ensuring social security. “We need deep structural reforms, not tinkering at the fringes, to create five million jobs every year in the formal sector, ” said Sinha. He added that the government’s objective was to achieve 7-8% growth over the long-term that is non-inflationary.
The minister said the economic reform process was not a T-20 game in which one may try to hit a six on every ball. “One has to perform sustainably over a long period of time keeping the score board going up,” he said.
Official estimates suggest India’s economy would grow this fiscal by 5.4% to 5.9%. Growth had slumped below 5% in the last two consecutive fiscals.
IMF’s policy advisory committee chairman and Singapore’s deputy PM Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who attended the conclave, agreed that India needs to boost economy’s efficiency, but said the country has limited time. He pointed out that India’s economy has the largest unrealised potential in the world.

Fly SpiceJet at half the price of its peers on some routes

Airports Authority of India
(The DGCA ordered SpiceJet…)
NEW DELHI: No-frills carrier SpiceJet began offering cut-price fares on some sectors, in some instances almost half those charged by rivals, even as ticket rates surged across the board after the airline that's struggling for survival grounded more planes and cancelled more flights. Still, the Kalanithi Maran-owned carrier also got some relief on Wednesday as the state-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) gave it some slack, it got another five days to pay dues of Rs 200 crore.
SpiceJet is offering tickets for last-minute travel at discounts of as much as 50% on key routes, although the difference isn't much on the No. 1 Mumbai-Delhi route. But flight cancellations by the airline have led to fares going up in general. "While SpiceJet is offering cheapest last-minute fares in key sectors, average fares as compared to November-end have also increased by about 15% due to one airline pulling a lot of flights," said Sharat Dhall, president of Yatra-.com, an online travel portal.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) ordered SpiceJet last week to stop taking advance bookings of more than a month and withdrew 186 flight slots due to the carrier's financial woes that have led to aircraft having to be returned to leasing companies. The DGCA order came into force on Monday evening.
The fare gap is most pronounced on the Delhi-Kolkata, Delhi-Chennai, Delhi-Hyderabad and Mumbai-Goa sectors. "The avenues to raise revenues for SpiceJet are limited since they cannot book beyond one month," said an airline executive, who did not want to be identified.
"They have a limited number of flights flying. Passengers are also not willing to fly SpiceJet because there is no schedule integrity due to so many cancellations."
The carrier's Boeing 737s fleet, down to 37 in July from 42 before it had to return planes, were further reduced to 22 on Wednesday. This led to the cancellation of 25 flights from Delhi, 17 from Mumbai, 15 from Bengaluru and 11 each from Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad. Before the crisis, the airline had 72 flights from Delhi, 40 from Mumbai, 46 from Bengaluru and 35 from Hyderabad, 26 from Kolkata and 46 from Chennai. SpiceJet has cancelled more than 1,800 flights in a month after it decided to shrink its fleet.
 
Government officials said AAI has given the airline time to clear its dues. "The airline has been given time till Monday on payment of Rs 5 crore to AAI today," said government sources. AAI had asked the airline to clear dues or be denied credit, meaning it would have to pay cash to use the facilities. The DGCA has, meanwhile, asked the airline to refund passengers whose flights have been cancelled by December 15. The airline has already refunded 55,000 passengers, according to figures available with the regulator.
SpiceJet has also for the first time delayed salaries to employees in December, after giving their tax filing forms late in the previous months. The DGCA had on Friday warned it to pay salaries on the 7th of every month. The regulator has also asked SpiceJet to submit a financial plan by December 15 on how it will clear its dues of Rs 1,630 crore. In a statement last week, SpiceJet said its dues were lower but didn't give a number.
On Tuesday, executives from the parent Sun Group headed by finance chief SL Narayanan met DGCA officials in Delhi for the first time since the crisis broke.

Nifty seen opening lower; may retest 8300 levelsDow Jones
(Tracking the momentum,…)
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open lower on Thursday following muted trend seen in other Asian markets. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to retest its crucial psychological support level of 8,300 in trade today.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 35 points lower at 8,353 indicating a negative opening on the domestic market.
Nifty remained volatile throughout the session to conclude the day with a gain of 14 points at 8355. The Sensex gained 34 points and ended at 27831 on Wednesday.
"Nifty breached the support level of 8420 in last couple of trading sessions and confirmed further weakness," GEPL Capital said in a report.
"It now has support placed at 8290 - 8280 range which is an important swing low on the charts as well as the 38.20% Fibonacci Retracement of the entire advance from 7723 till 8626," added the report.
The brokerage firm is of the view that the level of 8,420 would now act as a resistance for the index in the next few sessions.
It looks like stocks are moving both ways, so investors should remain cautious as the bounce back was not that strong and further weakness cannot be ruled out, say experts.
"After three-four days of big decline, there was some kind of respite, but the bounce back was extremely weak. The breadth was the only positive thing which we is about nearly 2:1 and some of the PSU banks did kind of get into an uptrend again," says Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com.
"But overall the other components of the markets were not showing strong recovery. This pullback could possibly see a levels of around 8,400-8,420," he adds.
"I am not sure that the market is possibly looking to go up in the short-term and from levels of 8400; but I do expect selling to resume and decline to 8,200-8,180 looks more likely outcome today," cautions Thacker.
Overnight, US stocks ended lower as the energy sector resumed its recent slide. The S&P 500 index suffered its decline since October 13 as another big drop in oil prices hammered energy shares.
"Falling oil prices have raised concerns about earnings for energy companies, with year-end tax selling putting additional pressure on the group," Reuters reported.
"Brent crude touched a new five-year low of $63.56 as Saudi Arabia's oil minister reiterated that he has no plans to cut output, while OPEC forecast global demand for OPEC crude in 2015 to fall to the lowest level in more than a decade," added the report.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 268.05 points, or 1.51 per cent, to 17,533.15, the S&P 500 lost 33.68 points, or 1.64 per cent, to 2,026.14 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 82.44 points, or 1.73 per cent, to 4,684.03.
Asian shares were trading mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was trading 0.76 per cent lower at 17,280 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 0.94 per cent lower at 23,298 China's Shanghai index was trading 0.56 per cent higher at 2,956.

Great Online Shopping Festival  Day 1: E-tailers discount shoppers  penchant for rebatesRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
In the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, when the clock struck 12, netizens woke up to one of the biggest online shopping jamborees in the country. With over 5 million potential shoppers already visiting the site gosf.in to register themselves, the 72-hour Great Online Shopping Festival (GOSF) from Google has 450 vendors this time, up from 250 last year and just 90 in 2012, when the festival was just for 24 hours.
Last year, about 2 million users visited the site and the merchants posted twice the growth on their daily average sales. This year, most partners are expecting three times the sales.
However, unlike the enthusiastic netizens, most websites woke up to this year’s GOSF late. While Jabong’s mobile app was updated and ready with GOSF discounts early on Wednesday morning, Amazon and Snapdeal reportedly woke up to the event a little later in the morning. However, Amazon and Snapdeal reportedly did not have GOSF on their main menu even after Myntra, now owned by Flipkart, interestingly had a very tepid discount of only 30% (for orders above Rs 1,599 – next to nothing in e-commerce terms) under the GOSF deals. In contrast, Myntra had a 50% off sale on Sunday.
This year, Google has a special section offering products at Rs 299 with free shipping and cash on delivery to attract first-time buyers, who comprised over 30% customers last year. Discounts may not be on the lower side this year, but are visible across fewer and select categories and brands.
Compared to last year, discounts have indeed come down for gadgets, a category that has picked up tremendously in online retail, said Nitin Mathur, co-founder, 91mobiles, an online gadget research and comparison site. “However, online retailers may be utilising discounting as a tool more to promote other emerging categories such as fashion and accessories (which are relatively newer categories for some of the online stores), and new distribution channels such as their mobile apps…” he added.
Discounts are just a medium to attract first-time shoppers, said Manu Agarwal, founder, Naaptol: “…The idea of Google is to educate people who haven’t experienced e-commerce as a shopping medium.”
On the first day of GOSF, on Tuesday, Jabong observed an extraordinary leap with its revenue rising four times compared to its sales on any regular day. “There has been a rise in revenue from mobile by at least six times compared to the last GOSF. Even the traffic from GOSF on the website has significantly risen by eight times as compared to last year,” said Praveen Sinha, founder and MD, Jabong.
This year, Jabong has opened its doors to some of the best offers from exclusive brands like River Island, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, among others, Sinha added.
Meanwhile, ShopClues saw unprecedented sales and an increase in traffic by as much as 200%, just within the first 90 minutes of the festival launch. Sanjay Sethi, co-founder and CEO, ShopClues, said, “When the GOSF offers went live at 12 midnight, our site saw a 200% surge in traffic and close to 250% increase in sales within the first 90 minutes.
ShopClues had discounts going up to 85% on some of its top-selling products.
eBay India has special promotions and offers every day with customers having the opportunity to win an iPhone every 15 minutes and a Google Glass each day. Shivani Dhanda, head – marketing, eBay India, said: “This GOSF, eBay India customers will be able to access great deals and discounts across a wide range of products. We are offering special deals across brands and categories along with discounts on watches, cameras, TVs, laptops and home décor, among others. We are also offering consumers exclusive eBay merchandise including the iberry Auxus ONE smartphone and iberry RIST smartwatch.”
HomeShop18 is offering discounts of up to 80% with deliveries at no extra shipping cost, with its lowest product going for as little as R149. “In previous years of GOSF, we witnessed exceptional increase in traffic and sales on both the website as well as our mobile platform. This shopping festival has proved beneficial for us, recording a 3x increase in sales and 40% more traffic via the app… The categories that drive sales during the shopping festival are clothing, accessories and footwear, digital products, electronics and gadgets,” said Sundeep Malhotra, founder and CEO, HomeShop18.
For the second year in a row, Adlabs Entertainment is expecting online ticket sales to go up by 50-75% for Imagica and Aquamagica, its theme and water park, respectively, located at Khalapur off Mumbai-Pune Expressway.
At Adlabs, 20-30% of ticket sales continue to be from its website where customers pick and choose their choice of packages and offers.
As part of GOSF, Amazon India is doling out offers from across categories with a 10% cashback on HDFC Bank debit and credit cards (for purchases above R3,999). The e-commerce major is offering up to 70% off on home and kitchen products, books, movies, music and video games, up to 60% off in fashion and a flat 40% off on select products in toys and games. Infibeam, on the other hand, is giving out up to 45% off on mobiles, up to 50% off on tablets and up to 70% off on home theatres and home appliances, among others.
The action is also moving towards cashback and MobiKwik, a mobile wallet service provider, seems to be leading the way. As opposed to heavy discounting, cashback seems to be a better way of rewarding your customers this season, said Upasana Taku, co-founder, MobiKwik. “We are offering 20% cash backs on all leading e-commerce sites such as Snapdeal, eBay, Shopclues, HomeShop18, Naaptol, Infibeam, Dominos, MakeMyTrip, BookMyShow, Purplle, Pepperfry, AmericanSwan and FashionAndYou, among others, for payments made through the MobiKwik wallet. This is beyond the merchant offers for GOSF. Consumers stand to save money and make more purchases. We gain customer loyalty and increase awareness about our product,” added Taku.

SpiceJets $4-billion order for 737 Max aircraft intact  says BoeingRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
Despite the recent financial woes that have led SpiceJet to cut down fleet and operations, the airline’s scheduled delivery of 42 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, worth over $4 billion, remains intact with the first aircraft set to be delivered by the end of 2018.
“The order (by SpiceJet) very much holds even though the airline is working towards reducing debt and getting back to healthier finances,” Dinesh A Keskar, Boeing’s vice-president (sales) for Asia Pacific and India, said in a telephonic interview.
“Our track record is very good and not a single Boeing order has so far been canceled. We don’t expect SpiceJet to cancel or reduce their order,” Keskar added.
When asked about the status of the Boeing order, a SpiceJet spokesperson said the airline didn’t want to comment on the issue.
During the last two months or so, billionaire Kalanithi Maran-controlled SpiceJet has gradually reduced its Boeing 737 fleet size to 22 planes, down from the 37 it operated earlier this year. Salaries have been delayed and the airline has faced regulatory scrutiny, following a spate of cancellations aimed at cutting costs. The airline has also failed to get an external investor on board despite trying for the last two years.
Recently, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) barred SpiceJet from accepting bookings for travel more than a month in advance. According to a Bloomberg report, DGCA has also cancelled 183 of the airline’s landing and parking slots. However, Boeing is confident that recovery for SpiceJet is around the corner.
By cutting fleet size SpiceJet has reduced its monthly expenses on fleet lease significantly. It has started deploying its aircraft on most profitable routes, scrapping the loss-making routes, Keskar said. “We are obviously cautiously optimistic on SpiceJet,” he added.
Boeing’s Keskar said that as many as 2,500 orders for Boeing 737 Max aircraft have been placed with the company by various airlines and leasing companies. The first aircraft of this configuration, which is expected to roll out in 2017, will, however, reach SpiceJet only during the final quarter of calendar year 2018.

Wiser after Ukhand floods  Centre tells SCWritten by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:00 am
In a curious submission, the Centre on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that it turned “wiser” about the adverse impact of hydropower projects on the environment following the 2013 Uttarakhand floods, which killed hundreds and left thousands homeless.
“We are learning every day. We became wiser about the cumulative impact of the projects after the Uttarakhand tragedy. We did not know about several aspects earlier. We are in the process of knowing,” the government’s counsel told a bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Uday U Lalit.
Irked over the statement, the bench asked the counsel why they gave clearances when they had no idea about the effects of mushrooming projects in the state, and what had prevented them from completing their study till date.
“You are still not taking a stand if you want to scrap all the projects since they are bad for environment. On one hand, you gave clearances for these projects and on the other, you say they adversely impact environment,” said the bench.
It asked the Centre’s counsel why it should not refund the money invested by the project proponents and protect the environment in absolute terms. It also pointed out that investments by PSUs such as National Thermal Power Corporation, National Hydroelectric Power Corporation and Tehri Hydro Development Corporation were stuck due to this indecisiveness. The counsel responded that the government was looking at a “middle path” and an “acceptable solution” for all stakeholders.
The bench also asked the counsel what actions the government proposed to take against officials who had given clearances to these projects.
The court said that many agencies supposed to look into areas of environmental concerns and clearances do not even have meetings for months, and hence granting the Centre more time to conduct another study was not acceptable.
The bench asked the Attorney General of India to show up and clarify the government’s stand on the issues on December 16.

Oil hits new 5-year low as OPEC trims 2015 forecastBrent
(Brent crude oil fell more…)
LONDON: Brent crude oil fell more than a dollar to a new five-year low on Wednesday as producers forecast lower demand for their oil next year.
In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) forecast demand for the group's oil will drop to 28.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2015, down 280,000 bpd from its previous expectation.
The price of the North Sea oil benchmark has fallen more than 40 percent since June as new supplies of high-quality crude from North America have fed a glut in many parts of the world.
"There is a growing realisation that the first half of next year is going to look very weak," said Gareth Lewis-Davies, strategist at BNP Paribas. "You start to price that in now."
Brent futures for January fell to $65.24 a barrel, their lowest since September 2009, before recovering slightly to trade around $65.39 by 1444 GMT.
US crude was down $1.69 at $62.13, having fallen $1.85 to $61.97 in early New York trading, its lowest since July 2009.
Trader and miner Glencore said on Wednesday there was a "good chance" oil prices would continue to fall. Oil chief Alex Beard said production levels were unlikely to change over the next 6-9 months.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday showed US crude oil inventories rose 4.4 million barrels last week to 377.4 million barrels. Analysts had forecast a drop of 2.2 million barrels.
US gasoline and distillate stocks also showed big builds, the API said.
  "Almost all the news flow points to a weaker market," said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
"We have had very bearish API data with large stock builds across the board, and also a very bearish Short-Term Energy Outlook from the EIA, with a sharp reduction in demand growth forecasts for next year."
OPEC members are divided on how to respond to the global surplus and falling prices. The cartel may still hold an emergency meeting before its June gathering, Algeria's energy minister said on Tuesday.
Italian oil and energy group Eni said OPEC may cut output in the spring and that oil prices will remain between $66 and $75 per barrel next year.
Top oil producer Saudi Arabia blocked production cuts at OPEC's meeting in November and has taken steps to shore up its market share.

Muslim groups demand action and protection as Agra conversion row grows biggerComments
Islamic organisations took to the streets on Wednesday protesting the alleged forced conversion of 57 Muslim families to Hinduism and demanding protection to vulnerable members of the community.
A meeting was held at Mantola, a Muslim-majority area, where protesters blocked the main road running through it.
Leaders and clerics cautioned the district administration to impose strict checks on people loyal to hard-line Hindu outfits such as the Bajrang Dal.
Mufti Abdul Khubeb Rumi condemned the alleged trickery used by organisers of Monday’s conversion camp to lure poor Muslim families into it with the promise of ration cards and other doles.
He said those involved in wrongful deeds must be brought to book but appealed to Muslims to adopt “peaceful measures to counter notorious elements indulging in conversions”.
The mufti said these families would continue to be Muslim despite their conversion because there’s no need for a re-entry into Islam.
“There had been queries regarding the religious status of these 57 families. These Muslims have denied being converted to Hinduism and so they continue to be Muslim.”
Cleric Syed Ikhtiyar Jafri echoed the mufti’s views. “Any conversion made under force or forgery is no conversion. It is matter of belief and once they stated that they haven’t switched to Hinduism, there is no need for them to follow any formal ritual to return to Islam.”
Haji Jamiluddin Qureshi, president of the Rashtriya Sarvdaliya Muslim Action Committee, held the the Narendra Modi government responsible for not restraining groups like the Bajrang Dal from fomenting trouble. “Such incidents have created an atmosphere of fear among Muslims and sparked communalism. Bajrang Dal people intend to disturb the peace and harmony.”
Later, the protesters submitted a memorandum to the additional district magistrate and the superintendent of police. SP Sameer Saurabh said forces were stationed at sensitive places.

L&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
Tokyo: Asian stocks fell early on Thursday as falling oil prices continued to feed into global growth concerns, while the dollar lost more ground against peers such as the yen and euro after a further drop in US bond yields.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 per cent as another large drop in oil prices took a heavy toll on energy shares and hit Wall Street hard overnight.
Crude oil prices fell as much as 5 per cent overnight after data underscored weak US demand and Saudi Arabia reiterated that it has no plans to curb output.
US crude posted a modest rebound early on Thursday after the overnight tumble, gaining 26 cents to $61.20 a barrel after falling to a 5-1/2 year low of $60.43 on Wednesday.
Tokyo's Nikkei lost 1.6 per cent, pulling further back from 7-1/2 year highs hit at the week's start, with sentiment bruised by the rout in US stocks, while the yen's rebound against the dollar showed little sign of ending.
The dollar was down 0.1 per cent at 117.610 yen, continuing its retreat from a seven-year high of 121.86 reached on Monday.
The S&P 500, at a record high just last Friday, fell to its lowest since early November on Wednesday.
"Recent nervousness in equity market sentiment is consistent with our view that equity fund positioning is near peak levels, which points to a near-term pullback," strategists at Barclays said in a note to clients.
"With underperformance by active managers, we worry that redemptions will continue and force an unwind of currently extended positioning," they said.
In addition to declining oil, concerns over the political situation in Greece have also dented appetite for risk assets.
The euro gained 0.3 per cent to $1.2479, putting further distance between a 2-1/2 year trough of $1.2247 hit on Monday.
Safe-haven government debt remained better-bid, with the 10-year US Treasury yield dropping by a basis point to 2.1603.
The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield fell 1.5 basis points to 0.390 per cent, lowest since April 2013.

Don t take any short position; like ICICI Bank: Sukhani08:00 am
Sudarshan Sukhani of s2analytics says the benchmark indices- Sensex and Nifty- are poised to mimic the highs seen in sectoral indices and advises investors not to take any short positions.
Sukhani, however, is wary of midcap stocks as he expects some profit-booking to be seen on the counter.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Sudarshan Sukhani’s interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: We have seen the Sensex and the Nifty catching their breath and the midcaps running off. Today will the Sensex and the Nifty catch-up with the midcaps?
A: I hope so. Yesterday the Bank Nifty did do well. Our suggestion was to go long in both the indices. The Bank Nifty made lifetime new highs, so it is the front runner. I would assume it is a matter of time before the Sensex and the Nifty also catch-up with the sectoral indices and with the midcaps. The pace of the rally may not be as we like which means it may not be today but it does appear that December overall will be a good month, whatever the gains are. It will be on the plus side.
Latha: Any levels for Bank Nifty. Only stops?
A: Yes, for Bank Nifty the stops which we discussed yesterday -18,300 remain. We should give the market a little leeway because sometimes they can be volatile and for the Nifty its 8,450. You should be on the long side. The much bigger message is that this market is not giving a signs of exhaustion so we should be on the long side even intraday trades should be on dips, on consolidations. Don’t take any short positions.
Sonia: You have a buy on ICICI Bank . Today it’s the ex-date for the stock split. How do you trade it even in the medium-term?
A: Buy it. ICICI Bank made lifetime high yesterday. It broke out of a narrow congestion route which was one of the reasons why the Bank Nifty did so well. We have seen how State Bank split and after that the prices have gone up because psychologically the numbers become easier to manage and the sector itself is upbeat. You cannot split if the company or the sector is not good enough.
Sonia: My question was if you buy the shares today, will you be eligible to receive the split shares – you will get them in 330-360 band today if you buy it?
A: Yes, that’s right.
Latha:  L&T Finance Holdings is the only non bank finance that you like or is the best of the lot?
A: It’s not the best of the lot. It’s the easiest to buy today because it has already gone through a correction and L&T Finance has been a distinct underperformer. So while most NBFCs have done very well, made lifetime highs even Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, L&T Finance has not done that. It was in a trading range, after a correction, I must repeat it’s a distinct underperformer but maybe it is breaking out of that range. If that is so then we are buying a good quality stock at a significant dip.
Latha:  Tech Mahindra - is it one of the classes of ITs or is it the best of the ITs. Incidentally Infosys is going to be in the news today and analysts meet starts at 9:30?
A: IT has gone out of that small minor correction that it was in and Tech Mahindra for today is the best, there was a narrow range, yesterday it had a very good day, better than most of the other heavyweight IT stocks, so I think it’s on its way to make lifetime new highs.
Sonia: You have picked up  Voltas today?
A: Voltas had a correction and a sideways trend and that sideways trend did not go down – that seems to be behind it as it made a very handsome move yesterday that tells us it is willing to breakout of that trend and that sideways move and move towards new highs. When the stock is in a trading range and says I am willing to breakout on the upside then we can anticipate that breakout because we are in a bull market.
Latha: Your views on Aditya Birla Nuvo ?
A: Aditya Birla Nuvo had a mild correction and that correction was over. It has now started its rally from that correction. It is now reaching its earlier highs, same pattern. If this market is bullish and it is, it will be few points but it will keep on going up and all of these stocks will cross their earlier highs.
Sonia: You have picked up  Tata Chemicals for a buy?
A: Tata Chemicals had those lifetime new highs and Tata Chemicals has come out of a bear market, not now a few months ago and since then the rally has been impressive and a stock that has been rewarded repeatedly by the market and makes new highs, just to give an example, it is like Asian Paints may not be exactly like that but charts are quite interesting. I do not know why it is going up but it is worth buying and holding as a position trade also.
Latha: Would you worry about some stocks like  Suzlon Energy and the big momentum boys who gave good gains yesterday, anything at all that you should profit take today?
A: A lot of this cannot be short sold, so you have to take profits. The word is correct and I would be very worried about the midcap rally that is going on for the last two days. A lot of these stocks, if somebody has them or brought them as a trade because you should only be trading in them, you should take profits. One of the other worries is the sudden exuberance that has come up maybe because of meeting in Mumbai or anything else. We shouldn’t get so much of exuberance in the market – that’s worrying.
Latha: This is a 250 point higher opening we saw on the Sensex. It has retraced a bit but still up 200. What is the call now, continue buying?
A: Yesterday morning I suggested buying and that was the best place. You cannot buy all the time. For short-term traders who listened and bought yesterday for the Bank Nifty and the Nifty, today should be a time to take profits; this is for the short-term and anyone having a positional view, maintain your position. If somebody doesn’t have a position in the Nifty and I wonder why he wouldn’t but if somebody doesn’t have then today this big gap up is not the time to buy. You will have to wait for a day or two and you will get an entry again.
Sonia: Anything fresh that you have spotted since market opening. If you look at names like Britannia Industries , Eicher Motors , MRF , all hitting new highs, any fresh highs?
A: Today the best idea is that if you have any short-term positions; take some money home especially for midcaps. This is a good time to cash in for the short-term trader. If you want to make an investing idea then Britannia is excellent. It is going to become far more than we can imagine in the next two years.
Latha: I wanted to ask you about one stock which could be bought now  Sun TV Network. It got badgered and the last two day rally has been mindboggling.
A: It has been mind boggling. It also been badgered. It is too early for me to suggest a buy. If this is genuine, if this is not just one of those midcap manias, if it is genuine then we will find many other opportunities. Today I would say avoid it.
Latha: What about Wockhardt?
A: Wockhardt is a much better chart. It has been building a base for a long time now after that big decline and the news – that news has been digested. I do not know if it’s a day trade but certainly its worth buying if you want to carry the position till the Budget.
Latha: How would you trade TVS Motor ?
A: TVS Motor has come back and chances are it will go higher. Therefore, for a swing trader, a short-term trader, just find an intraday dip or an intraday trading range and buy it.
Sonia: What is the sense you are getting for the base for the market now, how much has it gone up by and if one is still holding a long position, how much should the stop losses be moved up by?
A: The stop losses should be now 8,450 which is what is said in the morning maybe next time we speak it will be raised but that is the stop. We do not want to risk anything; the base hasn’t moved up, it is still 7,000-7,100. It’s just the highs that are coming in.
Latha: Can you give us a word on crude. We saw it perhaps putting a base, if you are tracking Brent then perhaps putting a base at about USD 68 per bbl. Where is the chart headed?
A: It is too early to become bullish on crude. I would say that we still have to give it time. If USD 68 per barrel is holding then perhaps a new view will come. As of now the trend is down. This is only a relief rally.

Gold extends losses on subdued demand, global cues

gold and precious material
Extending losses for the third straight day, gold prices fell by another Rs 25 to Rs 26,650 per ten grams at the bullion market in the national capital on Monday owing to slackened demand from jewellers and retailers amid a weakening global trend.
Silver also eased by Rs 50 to Rs 36,650 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said besides low demand from jewellers and retailers, a weakening global trend — amid the US employment data and strengthening dollar reducing appeal for the precious metals — kept pressure on gold prices.
Gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell by 0.4 per cent to USD 1,187.27 an ounce and silver by 0.8 per cent to USD 16.15 an ounce, the lowest level since December 2.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity fell further by Rs 25 each to Rs 26,650 and Rs 26,450 per ten gram respectively. It had lost Rs 225 in the past two days.
Sovereign, however, held steady at Rs 23,700 per piece of eight gram.
In a similar fashion, silver ready traded lower by Rs 50 to Rs 36,650 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 75 to Rs 36,625 per kg.
Meanwhile, silver coins continued to be asked at previous level of Rs 62,000 for buying and Rs 63,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Pretty Pit Mix Tastes Freedom After Over 4 Months At The PoundBeautiful Pit Bull Mix Tastes Freedom After Spending Over 4 Months At Chicago's City Pound

Her name is Fancy, but at this point she may as well be named "Lucky."
A 3-year-old pit bull mix who spent 135 days — more than four months — at the Chicago Animal Care and Control facility was finally saved by Woof Gang Rescue , a no-kill, volunteer-run nonprofit rescue group based in Wisconsin.
The Chicago Animal Care and Control's Facebook page posted photos Saturday of Fancy’s “freedom ride:”
Post by CACC Adoptable Pets .
According to the Dog News Examiner blog, which featured Fancy’s story in a post last month, Fancy was the longest resident of the city pound . She arrived as a stray in July and for the months that followed, adopters and rescue groups alike passed her by, despite her being described as intelligent, energetic and loving. With space running low at the pound, Fancy's days were numbered.
It was unclear exactly how close Fancy had come to being euthanized, as CACC staff did not respond to a request for more information. In an e-mail to The Huffington Post, shelter volunteer Lucy Scharbach said she and other volunteers were surprised Fancy had been at the facility so long because “she is gorgeous, attentive and going to make a wonderful pet.”

Fancy will now live with a professional trainer for a time before she is ready to transition from her extended stay in the shelter to life in a forever home. A YouCaring.com page set up to help fund her continued rehabilitation met its $1,000 fundraising goal almost immediately.
"Fancy says hello to all her fans," read a Facebook update posted Monday. "She would like to tell you she is settling in at her trainers house nicely and has an awesome new coat."

It s The End of the World As We Know Itreddit
A scene on Aaron Sorkin's The Newsroom recently struck me, at first, as simply an astute and amusing commentary on global warming... until the real world chimed in with one of those life-imitating-art occasions suggesting that R.E.M.'s apocalyptic song is destined to be the soundtrack of our future.
First, the HBO moment : Anchor Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels) interviews an EPA administrator (Paul Lieberstein, who will always be Toby Flenderson from The Office no matter what role he's playing) about a report that carbon dioxide levels have hit extremely dangerous new highs.
McAvoy begins in the usual mode for this sort of story, poised to emphasize the urgent threat of climate change while reinforcing the conventional platitudes that people need to take this seriously and work hard to remediate the problem.
His conversation, though, quickly goes off the rails.
"If you were the doctor and we were the patient," the anchor asks, "what's your prognosis? A thousand years, two thousand years?" The scientist's response takes him aback: "A person has already been born who will die due to catastrophic failure of the planet."
McAvoy: You're saying the situation is dire?
EPA guy: Not exactly. Your house is burning to the ground, the situation is dire. Your house has already burned to the ground, the situation is over.
McAvoy: So what can we do to reverse this?
EPA: Well there's a lot we could do...
McAvoy (interrupts): Good...
EPA: ...20 years ago, or even 10 years ago.  But now, no.
McAvoy (becoming increasingly uncomfortable): Can you make an analogy that might help us understand?
EPA: Sure. It's as if you're sitting in your car, in your garage, with the engine running and the door closed, and you've slipped into unconsciousness. And that's it.
McAvoy: What if someone comes and opens the door?
EPA: You're already dead.
McAvoy: What if the person got there in time?
EPA: Then you'd be saved.
McAvoy: OK.  So now what's the CO2 equivalent of the getting there on time?
EPA: Shutting off the car 20 years ago.
McAvoy: You sound like you're saying it's hopeless.
EPA: Yeah.
McAvoy: Is that the administration's position or yours?
EPA: There isn't a position on this any more than there's a position on the temperature at which water boils.
Then last week, an actual piece of journalism, the lead story in Monday's New York Times , confirms that things are indeed pretty much as desperate as Sorkin depicted on his pretend newscast. As the latest UN summit on greenhouse gases convenes in Peru, climate scientists report that a 3.6 degree rise seems inevitable, which they believe is "the tipping point at which the world will be locked into a near-term future of drought, food and water shortages, melting ice sheets, shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels and widespread flooding."
Flipping back to one last bit of patter from The Newsroom: The EPA administrator tells McAvoy, "The last time there was this much CO2 in the air the oceans were 80 feet higher than they are now. Two things you should know: Half the world's population lives within 120 miles of an ocean." "And the other?" "Humans can't breathe under water."
I propose that it is time for us to accept as a premise in whatever environmental discussions we have -- or indeed, in any deliberations on anything taking place in the future -- the fact that the world is coming to an end.
Well, not the world itself: The planet is actually pretty resilient, and will likely continue on its orbit unbothered by the warm spell; it's just people, along with most other life forms, that will disappear. Geologically, there's not so much to worry about; biologically, on the other hand, we have a situation.
Over the past decade -- since Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth brought global warming into the mainstream consciousness -- the rhetoric has been dire, but at least minimally hopeful: If we start doing this and stop doing that now, we can perhaps just barely salvage what is left of our ecosystem.
For a while it made sense, as Will McAvoy was trying to do on his newscast, to cling to a thread of hope in order to motivate reform and prevent people from descending into a paralyzing sense of helplessness.
But now it's time to accept our impending demise. Those are profoundly difficult words to write, but they are necessary: Our times demand a new rhetorical honesty. It is deceitful and irrelevant to sustain the charade that things may improve. Instead, it's time to start talking about how we will die.
(Maxine Kumin has a poem called " Our Ground Time Here Will Be Brief ." It was.)
As depressing as this is, it has at least the virtue of being true, unlike the kick-the-can-down-the-road policies that pretend the solution for global warming lies in producing (someday!) cars that get 150 mpg and cities powered by wind farms. And expecting Westerners (the 12 percent of the world's population who consume 60 percent of its resources ) to use less stuff.
If there's a silver lining, it is not a very satisfying one, but for what it's worth: I think it may prove refreshing, even exhilarating, to develop a new trope, a new truth, that lets go of the pretense that things will turn out ok.
"The progress narrative" that has undergirded Western culture for millennia was nice while it lasted, but it's also responsible for getting us where we are today, as it stoked the fantasy that we were invincibly moving ever forward, and that our rampantly voracious overdevelopment (exploration, imperialism, conquest, growth, "civilizing" nature) had no costs, no limits, no consequences.
As an English professor, I find it exciting to consider the possibilities for a new voice, a new style, a new writerly consciousness that may accompany and chronicle the winding down of our sound and fury.
Other cultures at similar points in their trajectory -- past the zenith, clearly waning yet close enough to the glories of the past -- have often produced keenly insightful literature and art.  Being on the cusp of decline provokes incisive self-reflection -- as the Greeks called it, anagnorisis: recognition.
Cervantes achieved this in Don Quixote toward the end of Spain's Golden Age, as did T. S. Eliot in "The Waste Land," his report from the front lines of the cultural disintegration that accompanied the collapse of European imperialism and the War to End All Wars: "These fragments I have shored against my ruins."
On a personal level, we have lately begun to do a better job of dying, and of accepting death -- writing "death plans," forsaking heroic measures of resuscitation. So too as a species we may learn to accept the inescapability of our impending ecological fate. We can celebrate the bright spots from our past human heritage, acknowledge our follies, and finally, deal with it: It is what it is.
There will be a limited future audience for this brave new art, since we're hovering on the verge of extinction, but it will leave an interesting time capsule for whoever might come to recolonize the planet after we're gone.
" Anthropocene ," a recently coined term for our present epoch, reflects the unique phenomenon of human impact that has changed (disrupted, ruined) the earth. Complementing this scientific assessment, a parallel aesthetic movement must acknowledge, better late than never, that we have irreparably fouled our nest.
We might demarcate our cultural expressions of this period as "epitaphal": our last words, as on a gravestone, inscribed with a solidity that will outlast our mortal frames and will announce for eternity (even in its conscribed scope) what kind of people we wanted to be and how we hoped we might be remembered.

1:50 pm Buzzing: Shares of SKS Microfinance jumped as much as 8.8 percent intraday to hit fresh 52-week high of Rs 379.50. Brokerage UBS initiated coverage on the stock with buy rating and set target price of Rs 500, citing strong growth potential and high return on equity (ROE) in the micro finance company.
SKS is one of its preferred NBFC picks (the others are LIC Housing Finance and Shriram Transport Finance ). The brokerage said after consolidating over FY11-13, non-banking microfinance companies (NBFC-MFIs) have resumed their growth trajectory, with loan growth of more than 40 percent in FY14 and H1 FY15. It expects low microfinance penetration and a rising market share for NBFC-MFIs to support a loan CAGR of more than 25 percent for the sector over the medium term.
1:30 pm Parliament: The select committee report on the Insurance Bill, headed by Chandan Mitra, has been tabled in Rajya Sabha today. The draft report, among other things has recommended 49 percent composite FDI in insurance, suggested changes in definition of reinsurance, sought to define the term 'control' in Insurance Act and proposed power to IRDA in formulating norms subject to acts and rules.
The panel has accepted suggestions to the draft insurance bill made by Opposition Congress. Speaking about the bill, Ashwin Parekh says it is a long awaited and may go through if there aren't many dissents. He clarified that composite FDI includes FDI, FPI and NRI components as well. Former LIC chairman SB Mathur feels the bill, if it becomes a law in this session itself, will lead to many insurance companies becoming public by 2016.

"Some information has been sought by the agency in this regard from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which is also investigating the scam. Once all the information is shared between the two agencies, about 17 firms would be booked under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act", a senior official said.
ED has, till now, registered 16 cases under PMLA to probe these allocations even as it recently questioned former Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao who has been named along with other private parties in a case.

"Some more attachments of assets, including immovable properties and fixed deposits of those individuals and companies named in the ED FIRs, will be carried out soon", the official said.
The firms against whom the new money laundering cases would be registered are located in various states of the country like Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra among others.
While the Supreme Court is monitoring the probe of both ED and CBI, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on blackmoney too is reviewing the overall investigations and coordination between the two central agencies in these cases.
The CBI has registered about 32 FIRs in the coal allocations case till now.

Israel defence minister: US censure slows down settlementsPrint

By: Associated Press | Jerusalem |
Posted: December 10, 2014 3:10 pm
US criticism of Israel’s settlement policies has slowed down construction in the West Bank, Israel’s defence minister said in comments broadcast on Wednesday, adding that he hopes the slowdown will be “temporary” because the Obama administration “won’t be around forever.”
The minister, Moshe Yaalon, has previously derided US peace efforts in the Middle East, calling Secretary of State John Kerry “obsessive” and “messianic.” Those comments rankled Washington officials and stoked tensions with Israel’s most important ally.
Speaking on Tuesday at a Jewish seminary in the West Bank, Yaalon said Israel wants to build more settlement housing but that global criticism, led by the United States, has prompted restraint.
“The United States has led the charge,” Yaalon said. “We are very, very careful not to push the envelope too much. This (US) administration won’t be around forever and I hope it is temporary.”
The remarks, broadcast on Israeli Army Radio, could lead to further tensions between Israel and Washington – tensions that were clearly on display in October, when the US Washington.
The Obama administration has long had a tense dynamic with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, mostly for his close relationship with the Republican Party and for what is sometimes seen as a lecturing tone toward President Barack Obama. Disagreements over Israel’s West Bank settlement policies have also often flared tensions.
Anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now says no new settlement building plans have been announced since a meeting between Obama and Netanyahu in October, but that building of previously announced housing continues.

Offshore debt mkts attractive to Indian corporates: FitchOffshore debt markets attractive to Indian corporates: Fitch
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 10, 2014  | 15:25 IST
Rating agency Fitch said on Wednesday it expects Indian corporates to increasingly access offshore debt markets to meet their funding requirements.
The offshore bond issuances by non-financial Indian corporates is estimated to have crossed $13 billion so far in 2014 as against around $9 billion in 2013.
"The offshore capital markets are increasingly attractive to Indian corporates partly because of better pricing for their bonds," Fitch Ratings said in a statement.
The growth in access to bond market is likely to be driven by the need to refinance debt and fund capex once the investment cycle restarts, it added.
The offshore markets now present a relatively more cost-effective funding source as compared with onshore funding for Indian corporates, it said.
Also the reduction of withholding tax on interest payments of offshore bonds to 5 per cent with effect from July 2014, compared with 20 per cent earlier, has incentivised investment in such instruments.
"Investor demand for Indian bonds has also been strong due to expectations of improvement in Indian economic growth, improved political stability and strong liquidity in global capital markets," Fitch added.

India will soon raise the foreign investment cap in insurance sector and work for making the tax regime "civilised" to attract overseas investments, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said while exuding confidence of achieving 6 percent growth next fiscal.
Underlining that growth would depend on the states, he talked about cooperative federalism and announced release of Rs 11,000 crore to states in the current fiscal as part payment towards CST compensation to facilitate roll-out of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
Jaitley was replying to a debate in the Lok Sabha on Supplementary Demands for Grants for an additional expenditure of over Rs 12,500 crore. However, the actual cash outgo would be Rs 500 crore. It was later passed by the House.
Referring to the Select Committee report on further opening of insurance sector, Jaitley said, "Large investments are waiting to come in. We have to open the doors."
The committee has suggested a composite foreign investment cap of 49 percent in the insurance sector, as against 26 percent FDI cap currently.
The government would endeavour to usher in a "civilised tax policy" to attract overseas investments, he said, adding FDI regime has already been relaxed in defence sector and has generated lot of interest from top global manufacturers.
On the growth prospects, Jaitley said there are challenges but hoped that it would be within the projected range of 5.4-5.9 percent in 2014-15 and cross 6 percent in the next financial year.
Economic growth fell to sub-5 percent in two consecutive fiscals in 2012-13 and 2013-14, he said, adding it had an impact on revenue collection, fiscal deficit and government's expenditure on developmental works.

Akula buys 26% stake in Vaya; eyes small bank licence

Having forced to quit SKS Microfinance , which he founded, three years ago, Vikram Akula has returned to the financial inclusion space by buying 26 percent stake in a start-up Vaya Finserv, which is also eyeing small bank licence.
Akula, once seen as the poster boy of microfinance in India, has joined the Hyderabad-based business correspondent firm as Chairman.
"Now that my three-year non-compete period (with SKS) is over I was looking to get back to financial inclusion. I chose to join Vaya because it is focused on under-banked districts," Akula said today.
He, however, declined to give details about the amount he has invested to buy the stake.
Besides Akula, SKS Trust, which he runs, holds around 65 per cent in Vaya and the rest is owned by the employees.
Vaya, which started its operation this July, facilitates savings and loans for women's self-help groups.
Akula said Vaya will be applying for small finance banks.
"We will apply for small finance banks licence. We are talking to external advisors and preparing the application."
Akula was forced to resign from SKS board after the micro lender suffered heavy losses in key market of Andhra Pradesh.
RBI last month issued final guidelines on small finance and payment banks. It will accept the applications for differentiated banks licences till January 16.
Currently, Vaya is working as a business correspondent on behalf of Yes Bank in four districts of Marathwada region of Maharashtra and two districts of northern Karnataka.
The company is also in talks with some public as well as private sector banks to work for them as business correspondent. Vaya has 183 employees and disbursed 7.5 crore of loans so far.
SKS Microfin stock price
On January 02, 2015, SKS Microfinance closed at Rs 414.75, up Rs 1.55, or 0.38 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 421.00 and the 52-week low was Rs 163.70.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 12.26 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 33.83. The latest book value of the company is Rs 37.84 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 10.96.

FII flows could halve to about $10 bn next year: Neelkanth MishraFII flows could halve to about $10 bn next year: Neelkanth Mishra
Samie Modak | Mumbai Dec 10, 2014 10:49 PM IST
Flows from foreign investors are likely to slow down substantially next year, says foreign brokerage Credit Suisse. The Indian markets, however, could deliver up to 30 per cent return in the next two years, led by corporate earnings growth. Neelkanth Mishra, managing director-equity research, Credit Suisse, says the sharp drop in crude oil prices isn’t very positive for the Indian market. Edited excerpts from a press briefing by Credit Suisse on the 2015 outlook:
On the impact of declining oil prices
The decline in oil prices is due to weak world demand. The (National Stock Exchange's benchmark) Nifty and oil have positive correlation. In 20 years, you will struggle to find negative correlations between Indian markets and oil. Weak oil prices will hurt India’s exports. So, the benefit of $35 billion to the current account deficit on account of the decline in oil prices will be eroded by the drop in exports. Fuel is a small component in consumer inflation. The first-order impact on consumer inflation because of a fall in oil prices won’t be that big.
On FII flows slowing
A lot of oil producing countries are big exporters of capital. A lot of sovereign wealth funds backed by countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE have been investing $8-10 billion into India each year. These flows will slow down substantially. The overall FII (foreign institutional investor) flows into the Indian market will come down from an average $20 billion to about $10 billion next year.
On India economic stability
The real story is playing outside India, where the world is devoid of growth. There are fears that China’s growth is significantly over-reported -- if one factors that in, the global growth scenario is worse. India is an island of stability. Even if our growth doesn’t accelerate, it is still much better than in the rest of the world. The world is going through deflation.
On quantitative easing
Even if the US is ending its quantitative easing (QE) programme, other regions like the euro zone and Japan have been printing money. Our estimate is that QE in 2015 will be 1.9 times more than this year.
30% return in the next two years
We don’t have an explicit price target for the Indian market. But earnings are expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 16 per cent over the next two years. If that happens, the market will give 30 per cent returns over the next two years. In every economy, though, there is something to blow a hole in the story.
India’s valuations
On a relative basis, India’s valuation premium to MSCI World is still quite low, below the historic highs. But if Europe and US had to tank sharply, the relative valuations might turn expensive. There is big turmoil in the world market.
On market corrections
There is a strong feeling of being left out among investors. That’s partly a reason why the Indian markets don’t fall sharply. So far, the correction has been surprisingly orderly. But if one big bank in some geography blows up, there will be a huge sell-off. The contagion risk will hurt us a lot. Those are the events we have to be cautious of when you are looking at the Indian markets.

New Delhi, December 10:  
Swedish furniture giant IKEA plans to expand its supplier base in India and double sourcing by 2020. The company sources merchandise worth €315 million from India currently.
In a statement, Sandeep Sanan, Head of Sourcing, IKEA South Asia, said, “We believe there is tremendous potential in India…We believe that many suppliers will come from other segments that are looking to diversify their business.”
Suppliers
The company currently has 48 suppliers in India.
As part of its “Make More in India” initiative, IKEA India will conduct seminars in Mumbai and Bengaluru in January and expects to engage with nearly 100 new potential suppliers.
These suppliers will be in existing categories such as textiles and rugs; as well as new categories like furniture, mattresses, and sustainable materials that include bamboo and acacia; and growing suppliers for categories such as metal, plastics, and lighting, the company said in a statement.
Sanan added, “Our history of developing successful supplier relationships in India means that IKEA is well positioned, not just to ‘Make in India’ for India, but to ‘Make More in India’ for IKEA across the world.
This gives the current and future new suppliers in India a much bigger market to aspire for.”

India Inc Forex Debt Raising to Hit $20 Billion in 2015: RBSMumbai: Indian corporates are likely to raise a record $20 billion from offshore bond sales next year, having already mopped up $18 billion till now in 2014, an RBS official said on Wednesday.
Last year, non-financial corporates raised $15 billion in debt from overseas market.
"Domestic corporate have already raised around $18 billion through offshore bonds in transactions numbering 30-35 so far during the current year (CY2014) and this is likely to top $20 billion next year," RBS head for debt capital markets (India and Southeast Asia) Manmohan Singh said.
"Moreover, there are at least one or two such transactions in the pipeline this month," Mr Singh added.
About the domestic credit outlook going forward, he said, "Liquidity will remain as I don't see the underlying rates to go up. Spreads for Indian credits will continue to be attractive. There will be new  issuers coming to the market."
"The companies, which were unable to do so in past due to high L+500 pricing, can look at capital market issuance now," he further said, adding that overseas debt raising will continue as corporate will continue to pare their domestic debt.
On India's credit outlook, Mr Singh said, "If the momentum in the economy continues and oil prices continue to fall, then there could be a rating upgrade. As we speak today on a relative value basis, investors think that we are expensive."

Delhi High Court stops sale of Xiaomi phonesTata Motors sales up 10 pct in December
The Delhi High Court in an interim order has restrained Xiaomi as well as online e-commerce site Flipkart from selling in India handsets of the Chinese mobile maker that run on the technology patented by Ericsson.
The court has also restrained Xiaomi or its agents from making, assembling, importing or offering for sale its devices which are infringing the mobile phone technology patented by Ericsson.
Justice G P Mittal directed the customs authorities to prevent import of Xiaomi phones that are infringing the patents of Ericsson and if any consignment is imported, the same be informed to Ericsson and its objections be decided as per the Intellectual Property Rules.
“I am satisfied that plaintiff (Ericsson) has made out a prima facie case for grant of ad interim injunction in its favour. The balance of convenience also lies in favour of plaintiff and in the absence of an injunction order, plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and injury,” the court said.
It also issued summons and notice to Xiaomi and Flipkart and directed them to file an affidavit disclosing the number of devices – that are AMR, EDGE and 3G compliant – sold by them in India till date.
They have to also indicate in the affidavit the revenue earned by selling these devices till date.
The court has also appointed three local commissioners to visit the premises of Xiaomi and Flipkart where the devices are stored in order to inspect and collect documents as well as seal the infringing mobiles.
The total fees of the local commissioners, amounting to Rs 3.5 lakh shall be borne by Ericsson apart from travel and stay expenses, it said.
The local commissioners have to submit their report within four weeks, it also said.
The order was passed on the plea of Ericsson that Xiaomi has been violating its eight patents pertaining to AMR, EDGE and 3G technologies in the field of telecommunication.
Ericsson has said that it had invited Xiaomi to use its patented technology by obtaining a licence, but instead of doing so, the Chinese manufacturer launched its devices in India in July 2014.

Wilful Defaulter Case: High Court Reserves JudgementTata Motors Sales Rise 10% in December
New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday reserved its judgement on a plea that Kingfisher Airlines lawyers cannot appear before Punjab National Bank (PNB) in the process to declare the ailing carrier and its guarantors, Vijay Mallya and United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL), as 'wilful defaulters'.
A bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice R S Endlaw reserved the verdict after both sides completed their arguments.
"Arguments heard. Judgement reserved," the bench said.
Punjab National Bank (PNB), in its plea, had challenged an order of a single-judge bench of the high court which had allowed lawyers to represent the airline in the proceedings to decide whether the carrier and its guarantors, Mr Mallya and UBHL are to be held wilful defaulters for non-payment of dues of over Rs 770 crore.
PNB had contended that it had issued a notice on August 21 to the airline asking why it and its guarantors be not declared wilful defaulters for non-payment of dues as per RBI guidelines.
The lender had said in its notice that in the event of no reply within seven days from August 21, the airline and its guarantors would be deemed as wilful defaulters.
The single-judge bench of the Delhi High Court in its August 28 order had held as "unacceptable" the bank's reasons for not allowing the airline to be represented by lawyers in the proceedings initiated to decide whether the grounded carrier is a wilful defaulter for non-payment of dues and directed that two advocates be allowed to represent Kingfisher Airlines.
The single-judge bench had in its August 28 order also stayed the bank's notice to the extent that the airline and its guarantors would be held as wilful defaulters for not replying within seven days.
The court had said the operation of the default notice would not come into effect as PNB will have to give to the airline, within a week from August 28, the documents relied upon by it and Kingfisher was given two weeks thereafter to respond.
In its appeal, PNB had said the airline had not disclosed that a similar plea of the carrier, against United Bank of India, was dismissed by a division bench of the Calcutta High Court on July 16.
It had also submitted that the airline's appeal against the Calcutta High Court's decision was dismissed by the Supreme Court on September 2.
Kingfisher had moved the court seeking directions to the bank to rescind its August 21 notice and those issued earlier as well as to restrain it from taking any action against the airlines in pursuance of the same.
The court had also said that the hearing before the bank's committee will be held on September 22 and would be concluded the same day within six hours in order to prevent any delay.
According to PNB, the airline has wilfully defaulted in payment of outstanding dues of over Rs 774 crore.
It had also submitted that Kingfisher Airlines has already been held as a wilful defaulter by United Bank of India for non-payment of dues.

Oil price fall a "golden" chance to shift to clean energyAn offshore oil platform is seen in Huntington Beach, California September 28, 2014. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/Files
By Mitra Taj
LIMA (Reuters) - World leaders have a "golden opportunity" with plunging oil prices to put a price on carbon emissions since cheaper fuel makes the move less risky politically, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday.
Crude prices have dropped about 40 percent since June to their lowest levels since 2010 and the IEA is concerned that the fall could threaten a transition to renewable energy, Maria van der Hoeven, the IEA's executive director, said on the sidelines of the Lima climate summit.
The IEA said last month that oil prices could fall further in 2015 and that the market had entered a new era with lower Chinese economic growth and booming U.S. shale output.
"In fact, this is a golden opportunity," van der Hoeven said. "Policymakers can take actions unthinkable a year ago."
Van der Hoeven said the collapse in oil prices is a stimulus for consumers around the world. Leaders should respond with some sort of tax on carbon emissions or by cutting incentives for hydrocarbon production, she said.
"We're putting $550 billion into fossil fuel subsidies," per year, she said. "Use this opportunity to phase them out!"
The Lima summit is meant to come up with elements of a draft deal for fighting climate change, due to be agreed in Paris next year, including a guiding long-term goal.
Many developing nations, for instance, want a target of cutting world greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050, while some of the poorest countries say a 2050 net-zero emissions target is needed to ward off the worst effects of global warming.
Van der Hoeven said that such a target, which also has the backing of many environmental groups, may be unrealistic for a global agreement on climate change next year.
"It's 40 years from now. Energy will not be zero emissions by then," she said. "Maybe it's too ambitious."
Reports by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicate that emissions would have to fall 40 percent to 70 percent below 2010 levels by 2050 in the strictest scenario it assessed for greenhouse gas cuts.
Developing countries and environmental groups say that a far steeper cut is needed to limit rising temperatures that the IPCC says are stoking more heatwaves, desertification, floods and rising sea levels.

Modi, Putin to meet today; pacts on energy, defence among several others likely to be signed

New Delhi: Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Delhi late on Wednesday night for the annual summit talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday that is aimed at building on the already close strategic ties, particularly in the fields of nuclear energy, hydrocarbons and defence.
Putin, who is accompanied by a high-level delegation that included business tycoons, was received by Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan among other dignitaries. After the talks at Hyderabad House, the two sides are likely to ink 15-20 pacts. The talks at the highest level have been taking place since 2000 alternately in Moscow and New Delhi.
In his talks with Modi, both in restricted and delegation level formats, Putin is likely to seek deeper economic engagement with "time-tested" ally India to try to minimise impact of sanctions against Russia by the US and its Western allies over the Ukraine issue.
Putin is likely to seek deeper economic engagement with India to try to minimise impact of sanctions against Russia by the US and its Western allies over the Ukraine issue.
#russia #vladimir putin #narendra modi #brics
It will be the first annual summit meeting between Putin and Modi. The two leaders had met on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Brazil in July and during the G-20 summit in Australia in November.
Ahead of his visit, Putin termed ties with India as "privileged strategic partnership" and said construction of new nuclear plants besides military and technical cooperation was high on the agenda for talks. He said Russia was keen to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India and involve ONGC in oil and gas hunt in the Arctic.
Energy-starved India, which is the third largest oil importer after the US and China - has been pushing for greater involvement in major gas and oil exploration projects in Russia and both the leaders are set to discuss the issue. Russia is one of the top oil producers globally and has huge reserves of natural gas.
In the nuclear energy sector, Russia may offer to set up a total of 20-24 nuclear energy production units in India against previously agreed 14-16 plants. Both sides are also likely to come out with a roadmap for cooperation in the overall energy sector. Russian Ambassador Alexander Kadakin said the two countries will start negotiations for setting up of units five and six at the Kudankulam nuclear power complex soon and may sign a technical pact for units 3 and 4 during Putin's stay here.
Russia was awaiting India's decision to allot a site for construction of a new Russian-designed nuclear power plant and the issue may figure in the talks. To improve two-way trade, Putin and Modi are expected to jointly interact with CEOs of major companies from both the countries.
The volume of bilateral trade was USD 10 billion in 2013 and both sides feel there was "huge opportunity" to improve it significantly. India has been working to have a trade pact with "Eurasian space" for improved trade and commerce which will also improve trade with Russia.
India's exports, particularly food items, to Russia have gone up since sanctions were imposed against that country by Western nations for its interventions in the crisis in Ukraine. India has been maintaining that it cannot be party to any economic sanctions against Russia. Both the leaders are likely to discuss improving supply of rough diamonds by Russia to India.
Russia is the world's top producer of rough diamonds and India is one of its largest importers. Putin will also inaugurate World Diamond Conference on Thursday. In the defence sector, Putin may push for larger procurement of military hardware from Russia by India.
Russia has been a major defence supplier to India and its share has been 60-70 per cent in the country's import of military hardware. Sources said specific discussions are likely to take place on various key projects including the envisaged gas pipeline linking Russia with India and the ambitious Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) programme.
Listing the joint strategic projects, Putin said these included construction of new units for Indian nuclear power plants, promotion of Russian Sukhoi superjet-100 and MS-21 passenger aircraft to Indian market besides manufacturing of helicopters and creating a "smart city" on the basis of Russian technology.

India among top 10 destinations for expats: 6 key factsIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
India has been ranked as the second most ‘up and coming’ destination —the countries that are getting better as a place to live and work in — for expatriates after China, says an HSBC survey
1. With India likely to develop its industrial sector to catch up on infra development and the greater proportion of foreign direct investment entering the country would bring more expats, the report said.
2. According to the Expat Explorer survey, emerging Asian economies are an attractive destination for challenge-seeking and adventurous expats, with 44% of them saying they made the move for a new challenge.
3. Nearly 9,300 expats from around the world participated in the survey for 2014. Switzerland topped the overall rankings, while India stood 9th
4. Top expat jobs in India:
* Construction and engineering: 19%
* Telecom and IT: 21%
* Financial services: 10%
5. India has the third largest proportion of expatriates sent by companies for overseas assignments, after Brazil and Turkey, the survey said

Women-only cab cos cash in on Uber fears | Investors rain criticism on ban | CoverageTweet
BPAC has proposed Durga alarms in buses and autos in Bangalore to the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC).
NEW DELHI: About 40 cabs, all painted pink and plying the roads of Kerala, may provide the hint of a solution to the problem of women's safety. She-Taxi, a cab company that runs this service employing only women drivers, is now looking to expand into Delhi and Mumbai.
Two other companies — GCabs and Priyadarshini — which also run cab services with women drivers in other states are also looking to expand nationally.
Apart from GPS and GPRS installed in every cab, both, GCabs and She-Taxi have separate alarms for driver and passenger in the cabs connected to their respective call centres.
Bangalore Political Action Committee (BPAC), whose members include Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and TV Mohandas Pai, has conceptualised the "Gulabi Auto" project, an auto rickshaw service operated entirely by women. This is currently under the consideration by the Karnataka government .
"Safety is a big issue and this project also solves the problems of providing livelihood to women and empowering them. If women can be construction workers then why not auto drivers," said Revathy Ashok, CEO and managing trustee, BPAC.
BPAC has also proposed Durga alarms in buses and autos in Bangalore to the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), which agreed to such a pilot. These Durga alarms can be triggered in buses and autos by women passengers if they feel unsafe or are under threat.
They would work on the lines of an ambulance siren to alert people on the roads.
"We have pushed aggressively for the Gulabi auto project but the government seems to be dragging its feet on this. Bangalore would probably have the largest working population of women employees working late nights, and the government seems to be apathetic to their needs," said TV Mohandas Pai,VP, BPAC.
All She-Taxi drivers own the cabs they run and easily earn between Rs 5,000 and Rs 20,000 per month.

Cabinet Oks insurance bill; RS may take up next wkCabinet approves insurance bill; Rajya Sabha may take up next week

(The Cabinet, headed by PM…)
NEW DELHI: The Cabinet tonight approved the insurance amendment bill with a composite foreign investment cap of 49 per cent for presenting it in Parliament, incorporating the changes suggested by a House panel.
The Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , approved incorporation of amendments suggested by a Parliamentary select panel in the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008, sources said.
The Rajya Sabha is likely to take up the Bill for consideration and passage next week.
Earlier today, the Select Committee in its report to the Rajya Sabha had suggested hike in composite foreign investment limit in insurance sector to 49 per cent which would include Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as well as portfolio investment.
At present only 26 per cent FDI is allowed in private sector insurance companies. The hike in foreign investment limit is estimated to attract about Rs 25,000 crore of overseas funds in the sector.
"The Committee recommends that the composite cap of 49 per cent should be inclusive of all forms of foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investments," the report said.
The Congress support for the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008, is crucial as the ruling NDA does not have majority in the Upper House.
The bill, which has been pending since 2008, may not have a smooth ride in the Rajya Sabha with certain political parties opposing further opening of the insurance sector to foreign investment.
"The Bill is aimed at removing archaic and redundant provisions in the relevant legislations and to enable the insurance sector to work for the betterment of the insured with greater efficacy," an official release said later.

Ebay considering cutting 10% of workforceEbay considering cutting 10% of workforce
Reuters |  Dec 11, 2014 04:51 AM IST
Online retailer eBay Inc is mulling a plan to cut thousands of jobs early next year, as it readies to spin off its PayPal unit, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the company's thinking.
"We are focused on running the business and setting eBay and PayPal up for success as independent companies," eBay spokeswoman Amanda Miller said, declining to specifically comment on whether the company was considering layoffs.
Ebay is considering eliminating almost 10% of its workforce, or about 3,000 employees, the WSJ cited one source as saying. 
The cuts are expected to be localized in the company's marketplace division, the report said.
The spin-off, announced in September, highlighted the slowing growth of eBay's traditional marketplace business.

After Modi's appeal, United Nations to declare June 21 as World Yoga Day today

New Delhi: In a proud moment for India, the United Nations will declare June 21 as World Yoga Day on Thursday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged the world community to celebrate Indian yoga at the international level in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September.
The decision is being seen as a huge diplomatic win for India. 170 nations had supported Modi's proposal. European Union president Herman Van Rompuy had also told Modi in November that the 28-member EU supported his idea for a Yoga Day at the UN.
"Three months ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed to the world community that India's yoga should be celebrated as World Yoga Day. I am happy to inform you that we have received support of 170 nations and four days from today, the United Nations will declare June 21 as the World Yoga Day," Swaraj had said on last week.
#international yoga day #narendra modi #herman van rompuy #united nations general assembly
Keeping his focus on the importance of Yoga, Modi had named Shripad Naik as the minister for Yoga and traditional medicines in the cabinet reshuffle in November.
"International day of yoga, as our PM said in his speech, will encourage the growth of a sustainable pattern of consumption and lead to a balance between man and nature. Here in New York we believe that it will be celebrated in the way all other internatonal days are celebrated," India's envoy to UN Asoke Kumar Mukerji said.
Yoga guru Ramdev had also supported Modi in his move. "By bringing Yoga glory on the global stage, Modi has paid a tribute to the legacy of our Yoga Hrishis. India owes its identity to Yoga. This will be a day not only of formalities like posters and banners, but on this day, crores of people will venture out of their homes to practise Yoga. This means honour to India and Indianness," Ramdev said.
In his speech at the UNGA, Modi had said, "Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day. Yoga is an invaluable gift of our ancient tradition. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature."
Yoga is the 5,000-year-old Indian physical, mental and spiritual practice that aims to transform body and mind. "Yoga embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well being," he had said.

Jet Airways gains on SpiceJet woes  up 80% i...Jet Airways gains on SpiceJet woes, up 80% in 2 weeks

(Jet shares have soared 80%…)
MUMBAI: Jet Airways has been among the top performers on Dalal Street in the last two weeks as savvy investors bought the share amid troubles at rival Spicejet and due to declining fuel prices.
Jet shares have soared 80% since November 25, outpacing the BSE 500 index, on hopes the company would benefit from the recent mass flight cancellations by SpiceJet.
The BSE 500 index gained only marginally in the period. "Investors are reallocating their funds from SpiceJet to Jet Airways, while new investors are also buying the stock because it's the only airline company available in the listed space besides SpiceJet," said Mehraboon Irani, principal & head — private client group business at Nirmal Bang Securities.
SpiceJet shares have fallen 24% since December 1 when the troubles at the company erupted.
Analysts said lower aviation fuel prices, along with the fall in crude oil prices, would help Jet Airways improve its margins. Aviation fuel costs were around 38% of revenues for the half-year ended September.
"The fundamental factor for the share price to jump is the significant decline in crude prices, which are down 40% from peak," said Avinnash Gorakssakar, head of research at Miintdirect.com.
"In the short-term, as long as crude prices remain soft, the next couple of quarters will be much better in terms of EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation) margins."
Brent crude oil prices fell over 42% since June to a five-and-ahalf year low of around $66 a barrel on Tuesday.
Analysts and fund managers, however, warn a re-rating of the company is still some time away.
Jet Airways' revenues stood at Rs 17,301 crore for FY14, while losses were at Rs 3,667 crore. The company consolidated debt was Rs 10,577 crore as on March 31.
"We are not comfortable with airline companies as they have high debt on their balance sheets.
The sector is expected to benefit from lower crude prices but profitability of airlines still remains a big worry," said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer -equities at Kotak Mutual Fund .

Lenovo on Tuesday announced that its new YOGA Tablet 2 Pro with the built-in Pico projector will be avalaible exclusively on Flipkart.com from December 10 as part of the Great Online Shopping Festival (GOSF). The tablet will be priced Rs 49,490.  Strangely, this is Rs 1,500 more than the originally announced price of Rs 47,990 .
The large tablet has a 13-inch QHD screen and powerful 8W sound system with JBL Subwoofer+ Wolfson Hifi Codec and can be hung from the wall lie the rest of the devices in the series.
Rohit Midha, Director, Tablet Business Unit, Lenovo India said the YOGA Tablet 2 Pro elevates the original YOGA Tablet experience with technologies like the projector- a first for tablets.

Oil hits five-year low; who benefits from itA general view shows the Philadelphia Energy Solutions petroleum refinery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania December 4, 2014. REUTERS/Tom Mihalek
By Nigel Stephenson
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices plumbed fresh five-year lows on Tuesday, prompting investors worried about the global economy and renewed political uncertainty in Greece to dump shares.
The Athens government brought forward a presidential vote to next week in a gamble that could trigger parliamentary polls if Prime Minister Antonis Samaras fails to have his candidate elected. Greek government bond yields soared 47 basis points to 7.81 percent and stocks fell.
Chinese shares notched up their biggest daily percentage loss in more than five years and the yuan currency took its biggest hit against the dollar since 2008, adding to the gloom pervading emerging markets.
The dollar pulled back, propelling gold higher.
But the main action was in oil. Brent crude fell as far as $65.29 a barrel in Asian trade, its lowest since September 2009, before rebounding to just under $67.
Brent has fallen some 43 percent in the last six months on concern over a supply glut. It last traded at $66.77 per barrel.
European shares fell, following losses in Asia. Wall Street also looked set to open some 0.6 percent lower, according to stock index futures.
The pan-European Eurofirst 300 was down 1.6 percent, hit by energy shares.
"Weak oil and commodity prices in general are probably signalling that the recovery of the world economy is weak," said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.
Greek stocks sank as the earlier-than-expected start to the three-stage presidential vote increased uncertainty over the government's planned exit from an EU/IMF bailout.
Tokyo's Nikkei stock index closed down 0.7 percent, pulling away from 7-1/2-year highs as the stronger yen prompted investors to take profits on exporters.
Shanghai shares dropped more than 5 percent for their biggest one-day percentage fall since August 2009, snapping a two-week rally fuelled in part by speculation the central bank would ease policy further.
The yuan slid nearly half a percent against the dollar and last traded at 6.1855.
DOLLAR PULLBACK
The dollar fell 0.8 percent to 119.71 yen, pulling away from Monday's seven-year high of 121.86.
"People are cutting the higher-yielding currencies which they've been funding through being short yen and that position is being reversed somewhat, which is manifesting itself in a much lower dollar/yen," said Neil Jones, head of FX hedge fund sales at Mizuho bank in London.
The dollar had earlier gained on a Wall Street Journal report that Federal Reserve officials were considering dropping an assurance that short-term interest rates would remain near zero for "a considerable time" at its Dec. 16-17 policy meeting.
However, San Francisco Fed President John Williams told Market News International on Monday that "'considerable time' captures about as best you can with two words ... the appropriate time for lift off".
The euro strengthened 0.4 percent to $1.2368 and the greenback dropped 0.3 percent against a currency basket.
German 10-year government bond yields, the euro zone benchmark, edged down 1.6 bps to 0.71 percent
The weaker dollar pushed gold higher. It was last up 1.1 percent at $1,215.51.

BP to spend $1 bn on job cuts  restructuringBP to spend $1 bn on job cuts, restructuring
Reuters
Tweet
LONDON, Dec 10:  
BP will cut hundreds of jobs cut across its global oil and gas business by the end of next year in a $1 billion restructuring programme announced on Wednesday following steep falls in oil prices.
The bulk of the costs will go towards staff redundancies in all segments, including oil exploration and production, refining and trading and administration, a company spokesman said.
The British oil major said a first charge will be taken in the fourth quarter of 2014 as it implements a plan drawn up over the past 18 months to increase efficiency.
"As part of its wider ongoing group-wide programme to simplify across its Upstream and Downstream activities and corporate functions, it expects to incur non-operating restructuring charges of circa $1 billion in total over the next five quarters, including the current quarter," BP said in a statement.
Hundreds of jobs are expected to be cut in BP's main centres in Britain, the United States and elsewhere, sources said.
The restructuring charge is part of BP's cost cutting drive in recent years that saw it sell over $43 billion worth of assets to cover the cost of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill as well as the oil sector's rising costs.
A sharp drop in oil prices, that fell from around $115 a barrel to around $65 a barrel since June, has piled further pressure on BP and its peers as revenues slump.
BP is also considering further cuts to its 2015 spending programme beyond the $1-$2 billion reduction announced in October, that brought forecasts down to $24-$26 billion.
"This will be reviewed further as part of the 2015 plan, recognising the current outlook for oil prices," it said.

Structural reforms needed for 8% growth: Jayant SinhaStructural reforms necessary to achieve 7-8% growth, says Jayant Sinha
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 10, 2014  | 17:10 IST

Pitching for structural reforms, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha on Wednesday said they were necessary for achieving a sustainable growth of 7-8 per cent and making India a $5 trillion economy in next 12 years.
"If we take our $2 trillion economy and get it on the sustainable 7-8 per cent growth rate then we have a situation when the economy doubles in 10 or 12 years to $4 trillion economy. If rupee strengthens we may end up getting closer to $5 trillion economy", he said while addressing the Delhi Economics Conclave in New Delhi.
Sinha also made a strong pitch for deep structural reforms to achieve a sustainable and non-inflationary growth of 7-8 per cent over longer period of time.
"We also need to get the economy up to a long term growth rate of 7-8 per cent, it will have ups and downs. But ultimately long term growth rate for the Indian economy has to be 7-8 per cent", he said.
Sinha said there was a need to control inflation at 4-6 per cent over the years.
Listing the priorities before the government, he said, there is a need to pursue macroeconomic stability, build world class infrastructure, unlock entrepreneurial energy and put in place social security system.
Sinha also made a case for supply side revolution to enable the country dramatically increase its growth potential.
As per official estimates, economic growth in the current fiscal ending March 2015 would be between 5.4 and 5.9 per cent.
The growth had slumped to sub-5 per cent in the earlier two consecutive fiscals.

Pak kills 19 militants  wipes out 5 hideouts in two separate air attacks in Khyber AgencyBy: PTI | Peshawar |
Posted: December 10, 2014 5:38 pm | Updated: December 10, 2014 5:45 pm
At least 19 militants were killed as Pakistani military jets pounded their hideouts in two separate operations in the restive northwest tribal region near the Afghan border.
The jets targeted rebels in Tirrah Valley, Akka Khel and Koki Khel areas of Khyber Agency, killing at least eight militants and injuring 15 others this morning, a security official said.
The air assaults also wiped out five militant hideouts in the area where military has launched an offensive Khyber-1 to flush out the al-Qaeda linked militants.
In a separate operation late yesterday, security forces killed at least 11 militants in similar strikes in the same region.
Military jets heavily pounded militant positions through aerial strikes in Tirah valley in Khyber, one of seven tribal districts, where al-Qaeda linked militants are said to be active.
“In precise aerial strikes, 11 terrorists were killed in Tirah, Khyber Agency, on evening of 9 December,” Military said in a statement today.
The attacks came after a briefing by the military to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that forces have cleared vast areas in North Waziristan region and it was ready to resettle about one million people displaced by the operation which was launched in June.
Khyber is a key district as a major road leading to Afghanistan passes through it.
Following reports that the militants fleeing North Waziristan were finding refuge in Khyber, army launched a separate operation in October.
So far, more than 1,300 militants have been killed in the North Waziristan and Khyber offensives.
Khyber is a stronghold of Lashkar-e-Islam rebel group which is an ally of Taliban.

Telecom Commission may get a new memberTelecom Commission may get a new member
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 12:48 AM IST
Inter-ministerial panel Telecom Commission, which was set up in 1989, is likely to be strengthened with an addition of a new member from the finance ministry.
In order to restructure the TC, DoT has communicated to the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley that the proposal for an amendment to the constitution of the TC, and induction of additional secretary (economic affairs) of the Department of Economic Affairs as an alternative member of TC would not be possible sans Cabinet approval.
The TC was established through the decision of the Cabinet on 25 January, 1989. It deliberates on issues related to the policy changes, allocation and management of spectrum for commercial use, among others.
At present, TC constitutes of nine members, including secretaries from different ministries like DoT, Finance Ministry, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Department of IT and the Planning Commission. The TC is chaired by the secretary of the DoT.
The proposal for the amendment came after the 2G scam, as the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had, in its report on the 2G scam, commented adversely about the practice of conducting meetings of the TC with only full time members being present. The DoT has, since then, been practicing the habit of inviting all the part time members of the TC.

Russian, Indian funds to invest $1 billion in hydro power

(The RDIF and India's IDFC,…)
NEW DELHI: The Russian Direct Investment Fund will team up with an Indian partner to invest $1 billion in hydroelectric projects in Asia's third-largest economy, the head of the Russian state fund told Reuters on Wednesday.
The RDIF and India's IDFC , a leading infrastructure investor, will each commit $500 million to projects under a deal to be signed on Thursday during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to overcome India's chronic power shortages, and the country has vast untapped hydroelectric potential in its northern Himalayan belt.
RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev told Reuters the investments would back projects involving a large Russian hydro-power company but he declined to name the company.
The only large Russian player in this area is state-controlled Rushydro. Rushydro's spokeswoman Yelena Vishnyakova could not immediately be reached by for comment.
IDFC, which is 16 percent state owned, confirmed it would sign a partnership with RDIF but declined to comment on the details.
The Russian fund was set up in 2011 with $10 billion in state funds. It can back investments as long as its partners match it at least dollar for dollar. Dmitriev said he expected to commit funds to the Indian projects next year.
The RDIF has so far invested $1.3 billion of its own money along with $6 billion by outside investors, mainly sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Asia.
Dmitriev said the RDIF had managed to turn profits on investments in a Russian telecoms company and the Moscow stock exchange despite Western sanctions, a slowing economy and sliding oil prices.

Tax tribunal rules against Vodafone  says transfer pricing case within IT dept s jurisdictionTax tribunal rules against Vodafone, says transfer pricing case within IT dept's jurisdiction
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 12:49 AM IST
British telecom major Vodafone’s tax woes have come back to haunt the company in India with the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) saying on Wednesday that the income-tax (I-T) department has jurisdiction in the Rs 8,500 crore transfer-pricing tax dispute involving the sale of its call centre business to Hutchison in 2007.
ITAT was hearing a plea of Vodafone India Services, made in 2012, challenging the jurisdiction of the tax department in issuing a draft transfer-pricing order that sought to add Rs  8,500 crore to Vodafone's taxable income for FY08.
The order came after the Bombay High Court had refused to intervene in the matter earlier and asked the Tribunal to hear the case on a day-to-day basis. The matter will now go back to the HC as Vodafone can appeal against the ITAT order, a tax lawyer said. The I-T department had asked Vodafone to cough up Rs 3,700 crore as tax last year for sale of its call centre business to Hong Kong-based Hutchison in 2007. A mail sent to Vodafone did not elicit any response till the time of going to press.
This is not the only tax dispute that Vodafone faces in India. A separate capital gains tax dispute between the tax department and Vodafone had resulted in the former losing its plea in the Supreme Court. Later, the government came out with a retrospective tax law to tax the company, which was severely criticised and the matter is now under arbitration.
In an another dispute, the Bombay High Court had in October this year ruled in favour of Vodafone saying it need not to pay an additional tax of Rs 3,200 crore as demanded by I-T authorities in a separate case. The tax department had said Vodafone India under-priced shares in a rights issue to its parent. The tax demand was for two financial years ending March 2011. The amount included tax and interest for the tax demand for assessment year 2009-10.
On Wednesday, the Tribunal did not accept the valuation of the tax department and asked it to revise Vodafone India’s taxable income. The ITAT said the sale of a call centre business is an international transaction and the assignment of call option did take place. The tax authority’s draft transfer-pricing order was issued in December 2011, but the British company argued that the transaction does not attract tax.
 
The income tax department had asked Vodafone to pay Rs 3,700 crore as tax last year after the sale of the call centre business. 
A mail sent to Vodafone did not elicit any response at the time of publishing this report. 
This is not the only tax dispute Vodafone is facing in India.  A separate capital gains tax dispute between the Indian tax department and Vodafone had resulted in the tax department losing its plea in the Supreme Court. Subsequently, the Indian government issued a retrospective tax law under which Vodafone would have to pay. Then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, now the country’s presidential, had faced severe criticism for the move, with industry experts saying a retrospective tax would cloud the foreign investment climate in the country. That issue is now under arbitration.
In a separate tax-related case, the Bombay High Court in October this year ruled in favour of Vodafone saying it need not pay additional tax of Rs 3,200 crore as demanded by income tax authorities.  The income tax department had alleged that Vodafone India under-priced shares in a rights issue to its parent. The tax demand was for two financial years ended March 2011. The amount included tax and interest for the tax demand for assessment year 2009-10.

RBI set to allow FIIs  banks to trade in commodity marketRBI set to allow FIIs, banks to trade in commodity market
Sharleen D'Souza | Mumbai Dec 10, 2014 10:50 PM IST
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to give in-principle approval for foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and banks to participate in commodity markets, say sources in the know.
“The matter is in the final stage of internal review and an in-principle approval is just a matter of time,” said a source.
The development comes at a time when the country’s commodity exchanges (commexes) are suffering a heavy drop in turnover. According to a report by news agency Press Trust of India on Wednesday, the combined turnover of India’s commexes in April-November declined 48 per cent from the year-ago period to Rs 39.88 lakh crore, mainly due to poor trading volumes. According to Forward Markets Commission (FMC) data, these exchanges had generated a business of Rs 76.78 lakh crore in April-November last year.
In May, a five-member committee had said high-cost transactions in commodity futures caused a hindrance to the market. And, suggested this could be reduced if banks and FIIs were allowed to participate in the commodity market.
 
The panel, headed by senior economic advisor in the finance ministry, D S Kolamkar, had on April 28 this year given a report on ‘Steps to fulfil the objectives of price discovery and risk management of the commodity derivatives market’.
 
The committee had told the government in the report that high transaction costs in the futures market were an impediment to arbitrage. These, the panel had said, could be reduced by allowing banks and financial institutions, including FIIs, to participate in commodity futures trading.
The panel had as members Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) Secretary M S Sahoo, finance ministry advisor C K G Nair, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research professor Susan Thomas and Forward Markets Commission economic advisor Usha Suresh.
Policy and regulatory hurdles currently restrict banks and financial institutions from participating in the commodity market. Banks are also restricted under the Banking regulation Act. The committee suggested these needed to be removed, to widen participation.
The existing system of limits on open interest and risk management provides adequate safeguards against the risk of allowing foreign participation in Indian markets, it said.
The report also said commexes should explore the idea of extending trading hours that overlap with Asian and Australian markets, to improve their international competitiveness. At present, trading hours in India overlap with the European markets, but have little or no overlap with Australia and Asia, a large trading base that remains untapped.
The committee also advised the government exempt arbitrageurs from restrictions on holding inventory. It strongly objected to abrupt suspension of trading in commodities and recommended the commodity markets regulator voluntarily adopt regulatory governance rules from the draft Indian Financial Code, to reduce legal and regulatory risks in the eyes of financial firms.

Cabinet nod to cut govt stake in PSBs to 52%Cabinet nod to cut govt stake in PSBs to 52%
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 12:49 AM IST
Public sector banks (PSBs) will be able to raise up to Rs 1.6 lakh-crore from markets as the Union Cabinet on Wednesday allowed the dilution of government equity in these lenders up to 52 per cent.
This would enable these banks to partly meet Basel III requirements by March 31, 2019. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved putting in place a new ethanol blending policy under which the price of ethanol would be fixed according to the distance of sugar factory from the depots of oil marketing companies. Under the ethanol blending programme, 5 per cent ethanol is doped with petrol.
The much-awaited amendments to the Electricity Act were cleared, opening the gates for reforms in power transmission and distribution.
The amendments are likely to come up in the ongoing session of Parliament. If the PSBs are permitted to bring down government holding to 52 per cent in a phased manner, they can raise up to Rs 1,60,825 crore from the market, said an official statement, issued after the Cabinet meeting.
This means that the government would require to give almost Rs 79,000 crore (for common tier-I equity) during 2015-19, which will maintain its holding at 52 per cent.
However, as the government is likely to receive an amount of Rs 34,500 crore from PSBs as dividend, the net outgo will only be Rs 44,395 crore.
On ethanol blending, CCEA approved a proposal to fix the delivered price of Ethanol would be fixed in the range of Rs 48.50 per litre to Rs 49.50 per litre, depending upon the distance of sugar mill from the depot/installation of the OMCs.
Till 100 km distance ethanol would be priced at Rs 48.50. Between 101 and 300 km, it would be Rs 49 and for over 300 km, Rs 49.50.
The rates proposed would be delivered price at depot location and inclusive of all central and state taxes, transportation costs, etc which would be borne by the ethanol suppliers.

Defence to diamond will feature in Modi-Putin bilateral meetDefence to diamond will feature in Modi-Putin bilateral meet
Nayanima Basu | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 12:47 AM IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be holding their first ever bilateral meeting on Thursday, under the 15th Annual India-Russia Summit, to boost trade, investment, energy and defence ties.
This will be Putin’s sixth such visit to India, but it assumes importance against the backdrop of sanctions imposed recently on Russia by the US and European Union for its alleged role in the Ukraine crisis. So, Putin’s sole objective this time is believed to be nudging the Indian government to buy anything from fighter jets to diamonds.
During the meeting, India and Russia are expected to sign as many as 20 agreements in the fields of energy, defence, trade and diamond-cutting. Both leaders have already met twice and are learnt to have developed bonhomie of sorts. They first met during the BRICS summit in Brazil and then at a meeting of G-20 leaders in Brisbane, Australia. Putin, who is on a hurricane trip of 24 hours to India, is going to have a packed schedule, even as he will address Indian Parliament and industry on Thursday.
Defence
Russia has already expressed its keenness to have a considerable share in the Indian government’s plan to spend $100 billion to upgrade the country’s defence sector. It is concerned over India’s recent stance of buying more defence equipment from Israel and the US. However, Putin, apparently, is confident he will be able to push Modi to buy Russian Sukhoi superjet-100 and MS-21 passenger aircraft from Russia.
India had been traditionally making defence purchases from Russia, its ally since the ‘Cold War’ era. It still imports T90 tanks and Su-30 MKI fighters from that country, which is now expected to be jointly produced in India to promote Modi’s ‘Make In India’ programme. India, on the other hand, is upset over Russia’s renewed defence cooperation agreement with Pakistan. Moscow has already started shipping helicopters to Pakistan. But the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has always been believed to have friendly ties with Russia. It was under the then prime minister, BJP’s Atal Bihari Vajpayee, that India and Russia signed the historic ‘Declaration on Strategic Partnership’.
In an interview with news agency Press Trust of India, Putin said PM Modi was a “reputable political leader, who has already made a significant personal contribution to the promotion of the Russian-Indian cooperation”.
Energy
Under an ongoing civil nuclear cooperation agreement, Russia is expected to announce setting up of new nuclear plants in the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP). The Unit I of KKNPP became operational in July last year, though it gained complete generation capacity 11 months later. The second unit is yet to be operational. Russia has decided it will set up as many as 15 atomic reactors in both these units. An agreement on oil & gas is also expected to be signed, with Russia offering new exploration fields to India’s ONGC Videsh Ltd.
Economy
Modi and Putin are expected to jointly inaugurate ‘World Diamond Conference’ to make India a diamond trading hub. India and Russia are expected to sign an agreement on diamond-cutting. The two countries are also expected to launch talks for having a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement  to boost two-way merchandise trade, which currently stands at $10 billion, though both sides had set a target of achieving $20 billion worth of trade by 2015.
The CECA will be launched with Customs Union of Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus.

Revisiting mythology: RSS history wing calculates Bhagavad Gita s ageComments
It may be widely regarded as the universal book of wisdom, but there’s one truth even its strongest proponents, the RSS, can’t seem to fathom: When was the Bhagavad Gita, one of Hinduism’s holiest books, composed?
A painting illustrating Lord Krishna and Arjuna. Bhagavad Gita is considered what Krishna advised Arjuna during the Kurukshetra war. (Photo: Wiki Commons)
External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat attended a meeting organised by the Jiyo Gita Parivar and other Hindu religious groups last week that said the Gita was composed 5,151 years ago, but the history wing of the RSS pegs the age of the sacred text two years later at 5,153 years. Swaraj attended the closing session on Sunday and called for the Gita to be named the national book.
 
 “We do not want to dispute them as they are a cultural body but if they consult us we will tell them that our calculations based on historical facts show the Gita to be 5,153 years old,” Bal Mukund, national organising secretary of the Itihas Sankalan Yojana, the history wing of the RSS, told HT.
 
How did the Itihas Sankalan Yojana arrive at that date? Simple, it based its calculation on the wheel of time.
 
“Kalyuga began on February 18, 3102 BC,” says Mukund. “The Mahabharat began 36 years before Kalyuga near the end of Dwapar, meaning 3139 BC. The sources we have used are the Mahabharat, the Brahmavarta Purana and others. These texts also show the position of the stars (grah-dashaa) and we have been able to locate the exact dates based on these.”
 
The Itihas Sankalan Yojana says it is a professional historical body. Its website says it was registered in 1994 -- “5,096 years” into Kalyuga -- though its work began in 1978. Kalyuga is the last of four yugas in the Hindu concept of cyclical time.
 
Other Hindu groups have a more bizarre explanation. Former Bajrang Dal convenor Prakash Sharma elaborates on the yugas. “One human year equals one day of the gods. One year of the gods is 360 human years. One cycle of four yugas – Sat, treta, Dwapar and Kalyuga – is 12000 years of the gods or 43,20,000 human years,” he says. “Satyuga is 17,28,000 years long, treta 12,96,000 years long, dwapar 8,64,000 years long and Kalyuga 4,32,000 years long.”
 
Veteran historian DN Jha, however, disagrees with both dates, saying the Gita cannot be dated in this manner. According to him, the Gita is an interpolation within the Mahabharat, which itself developed over centuries and while some historians place the Mahabharat at around 900 BC, it is difficult to place a precise date.
 
However, Sharma has a different take: “Why should Western chronology be followed to date the Gita? Our own systems have to be used to date our texts.”

Delhi High Court stops sale of XiaomiphonesWritten by Aneesha Mathur | New Delhi |
Posted: December 12, 2014 12:04 am | Updated: December 12, 2014 2:12 am
The Delhi High Court has suspended the manufacture, sale and distribution of mobile phones by Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi Technology and e-retailer Flipkart in India until further orders.
The order was given on a plea by mobile technology company Ericsson that Xiaomi failed to take the licence to use the Standard Essential Patent owned by Ericsson.
Ericsson has also sought damages from Xiaomi for patent infringement. Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, which owns worldwide patents for several types of AMR, 3G and EDGE technologies, had approached the Delhi High Court alleging that Xiaomi Technology had launched its phones in India without taking a licence from them to use their patented technologies.
The company also claimed that they had invited Xiaomi to take the licence but it had launched the mobile phones in the Indian market without doing so. A Standard Essential Patent is the patent for the core technology essential to create something of a particular technical standard. In this case, mobile phones cannot be made without the GSM, GPRS, EDGE and WCDMA technology, which is patented by Ericsson.
Ericsson in their plea had also alleged that Flipkart had entered into an agreement with Xiaomi to sell the “infringing” phones. In an order issued on Monday, the court of Justice GP Mittal has accepted the argument that there was a “prima facie case for grant of ad interim injunction”.
The court has also directed customs authorities to not allow import of Xiaomi products into India. In a statement released to the media, Xiaomi India head Manu Jain has said that the company had not received any official notice from the High Court. “However, our legal team is currently evaluating the situation based on the information we have …,” Jain said.

Sri Lankan navy arrests 27 Tamil NadufishermenBy: Press Trust of India | Rameswaram |

Sri Lankan navy detained 27 fishermen from Tamil Nadu overnight, accusing them of poaching in the island nation’s waters, and released them on Thursday morning with a warning.
While 13 fishermen from Jagadapattinam in Thanjavur district were detained along with three boats, 14 fishermen from Rameswaram were held with their three boats when they were fishing in the mid-sea late last night.
The Lankan navy personnel also damaged their fishing nets, Assistant Director of Fisheries Department Sekar said. The fishermen, who were taken to Kankesanthurai naval base, were released Thursady morning after a warning not to fish in the Sri Lankan waters, Sekhar said.
Fishermen from Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Karaikal, Thanjavur and Pudukottai had decided to boycott fishing indefinitely from Thursday in protest against the incident.

No bilateral climate deal with India during Obamas visit  saysUSWritten by Amitabh Sinha | Lima |
Posted: December 11, 2014 10:09 am | Updated: December 12, 2014 10:57 am
 
The United States on Thursday said it would like to work more closely with India on issues of climate change but ruled out a ‘China-like’ bilateral deal with New Delhi during President Barack Obama’s visit in January to attend the Republic Day.
US lead climate negotiator Todd Stern said the climate agreement with China in November was the result of months-long engagement with Beijing and that kind of ‘process’ was not currently on with India.
“We don’t have anything in the works of the kind we were involved in with China,” Stern said.
The China agreement, he said, had been first discussed with the Beijing leadership during Secretary of State John Kerry’s visit to Beijing in February and the idea itself had developed several weeks earlier. “So that was the first time we had raised the topic with China and then we worked upon it for the next eight or nine months. It wasn’t something that was a quick idea and some weeks later we did it. We don’t have that kind of process going on with India,” he said.
The United States and China announced a surprise bilateral climate agreement last month which was hailed as a huge breakthrough that would give a major push to ongoing efforts to finalise a global climate treaty. The United States agreed to cut its emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2025 relative to 2005 levels while China announced a peak year, saying it will ensure that its emissions start reducing from the year 2030.
China happens to be the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases followed by the United States in the second place. India is the fourth biggest emitter.
The announcement of Obama’s visit to New Delhi in January had sparked off speculation about some kind of climate deal with India as well.
Indian officials in Lima do acknowledge that there could be a substantial climate component to the bilateral talks during Obama visit but said nothing was finalized as yet.
Stern said the US already had a close engagement with India on issues of clean technology and renewable energy and this might get strengthened further as India goes for a major scale-up of solar energy in the next few years for which an estimated $100 billion investment is required.
“We do a lot of bilateral work with India on clean energy and we will be certainly continuing that. We are highly engaged with India on a number of energy and clean energy efforts and initiatives. I am sure that would contribute to any goals that they might have for clean energy investment,” he said.
Meanwhile, Stern announced that US Secretary of State John Kerry would make continued…

Google News to shut down in Spain over Google Tax on Dec16By: Associated Press | Madrid |
Posted: December 11, 2014 10:01 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 10:54 am
Google said Thursday it will shut down its Google News service in Spain to prevent publishers’ content from appearing on it – ahead of a new law requiring the Internet search company to pay Spanish news organizations for linked content or snippets of news.
The move marks the first time globally that Google Inc. will shutter Google News and comes ahead of a new Spanish intellectual property law going into effect Jan. 1 nicknamed the “Google Tax.”
The company’s News product for Spain will stop linking content from Spanish publishers and close on Dec. 16, Google said in a statement.
The law did not specify how much publishers would have to be paid by Google. Spain’s AEDE group of news publishers lobbied for the law nicknamed the “Google Tax” and Google said publishers would be forced to charge the company “for showing even the smallest snippets of their content – whether they want to charge or not.”
“As Google News shows no ads and makes no revenue, this approach is simply unsustainable,” Google said. Google News has long rankled newspaper publishers and other content providers who contend the service tramples on copyrights by creating a digital kiosk of headlines and story snippets gathered from other websites.
Most venting has been limited to criticism likening Google to a freeloader, but there have been attempts to force the company to change its ways through courts.
Google maintains it obeys all copyright laws while sending more people to websites highlighted in its News services. The company also allows publishers to prevent material from being displayed in Google News, an option few websites choose because the service is an important traffic source to sell ads.
After Germany revised copyright laws last year in a way that could have required Google News to make royalty payments, Google required publishers to give consent for summarizing content and most did.
Europe’s highest court this year ruled that people have a right to scrub unflattering or outdated information from Google’s search engine. That case started in Spain.

Hong Kong police start clearing barricades; aim to retake occupiedstreetsA yellow banner reading "We'll be back" is displayed by protesters at the occupied area outside government headquarters in Hong Kong. (Source: AP Photo)
By: Reuters | Hong Kong |
Posted: December 11, 2014 9:47 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 3:29 pm
Hong Kong workers cleared large parts of the main pro-democracy protest site on Thursday as police hauled activists away one by one, marking an end to more than two months of street demonstrations that have choked parts of the Chinese-controlled city.
Groups of up to four police started taking protesters away from the Admiralty site, next to government buildings and the Central business area, after workers used wire cutters to remove barricades and dismantle bamboo scaffolding.
Martin Lee, one of the founders of the main opposition Democratic Party, student leader Nathan Law, media mogul Jimmy Lai and legislators were among those led away.
The mainly peaceful protests to demand free elections in the former British colony have represented one of the most serious challenges to China’s authority since the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations and bloody crackdown in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.
Hundreds of police swept through other parts of Admiralty, checking tents before dragging them away along with metal barriers, plastic sheets and umbrellas, which activists had used during clashes to guard against pepper spray and baton blows. A decapitated cardboard cutout of Chinese President Xi Jinping stood in front of a police line.
“The movement has been surreal. No one knew it could last more than two months … in a place where time and money are most important,” said protester Javis Luk, 27. There was little resistance as protesters packed up pillows, blankets and other belongings from inside their tents in some of the world’s most expensive real estate and prepared to leave.
Some protesters mocked police warnings, shouting their own aimed at Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Leung Chun-ying. “This is the last warning for CY Leung! Show your face, CY Leung,” they shouted. Key opposition pro-democracy lawmakers and Hong Kong media magnate Jimmy Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing, sat near the People’s Liberation Army base and adopted the three-finger salute used in the film “Hunger Games” against totalitarian rule.
Despite the clearance, the Occupy movement has been a social watershed, with people pushing back against increasing control and standing up to Beijing to preserve democracy and freedoms largely denied on the mainland. For many, it was a tearful farewell to the site where thousands had gathered in recent weeks and many have called home since late September.
“The movement has been an awakening process for Hong Kong. People who weren’t interested in politics before are now and aren’t afraid to get arrested, especially the young people,” said Labour Party lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan. The clearance at Admiralty comes more than two weeks after authorities removed barricades from a protest site in the working-class district of Mong Kok, sparking several nights of running battles between demonstrators and police.

Jet Airways up 80% in 2 wks | Fly Spicejet at 50% price of peersJet Airways gains on SpiceJet woes, up 80% in 2 weeks

(Jet shares have soared 80%…)
MUMBAI: Jet Airways has been among the top performers on Dalal Street in the last two weeks as savvy investors bought the share amid troubles at rival Spicejet and due to declining fuel prices.
Jet shares have soared 80% since November 25, outpacing the BSE 500 index, on hopes the company would benefit from the recent mass flight cancellations by SpiceJet.
The BSE 500 index gained only marginally in the period. "Investors are reallocating their funds from SpiceJet to Jet Airways, while new investors are also buying the stock because it's the only airline company available in the listed space besides SpiceJet," said Mehraboon Irani, principal & head — private client group business at Nirmal Bang Securities.
SpiceJet shares have fallen 24% since December 1 when the troubles at the company erupted.
Analysts said lower aviation fuel prices, along with the fall in crude oil prices, would help Jet Airways improve its margins. Aviation fuel costs were around 38% of revenues for the half-year ended September.
"The fundamental factor for the share price to jump is the significant decline in crude prices, which are down 40% from peak," said Avinnash Gorakssakar, head of research at Miintdirect.com.
"In the short-term, as long as crude prices remain soft, the next couple of quarters will be much better in terms of EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation) margins."
Brent crude oil prices fell over 42% since June to a five-and-ahalf year low of around $66 a barrel on Tuesday.
Analysts and fund managers, however, warn a re-rating of the company is still some time away.
Jet Airways' revenues stood at Rs 17,301 crore for FY14, while losses were at Rs 3,667 crore. The company consolidated debt was Rs 10,577 crore as on March 31.
"We are not comfortable with airline companies as they have high debt on their balance sheets.
The sector is expected to benefit from lower crude prices but profitability of airlines still remains a big worry," said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer -equities at Kotak Mutual Fund .

GAIL Falls on Lower Crude Price
Reuters | Updated On: December 11, 2014 10:47 (IST)
Shares in Gail (India) fell 2.3 per cent on Thursday.
Brent crude remained below $65 per barrel, not far above five-year lows hit in the previous session.
Gail is adversely impacted by lower crude prices due to its petrochemical and LPG businesses, says Jefferies.
Fall in crude oil lowers petchem and LPG realisations which in turn impacts company's margins.
GAIL also indicated trading profits remained weak in third quarter, Jefferies adds.

“We prefer to stay grounded with names that would benefit from a more immediate change in consumer sentiment, with a sprinkling of early-cycle plays from the industrials/materials space to take advantage of the reforms that may materialize,” says Vajpayee.

RBI issues monthly Bulletin for December 2014RBI issues monthly Bulletin for December 2014
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | December 11, 2014 08:41 IST
The Bulletin includes the Fifth Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement for 2014-15 and regular features like speeches of the Top Management and Current Statistics.
 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the December 2014 issue of its monthly Bulletin. The Bulletin includes the Fifth Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement for 2014-15 and regular features like speeches of the Top Management and Current Statistics. Four special articles are also included in the Bulletin: (1) Flow of Funds Accounts of the Indian Economy: 2012-13; (2) Survey of Professional Forecasters: 2014-15; (3) Developments in India's Balance of Payments during the First Quarter (April – June) of 2014-15; and (4) India’s External Debt at end of June 2014.
Flow of Funds Accounts of the Indian Economy: 2012-13
The Reserve Bank of India compiles the flow of funds (FoF) accounts which depict all transactions in financial instruments in the Indian economy on a ‘from whom-to-whom basis’. Six major sectors of the economy are considered - banking, other financial institutions (OFIs), private corporate business (PCB), Government, rest of the world (ROW) and households. Transactions between sectors are classified under nine major categories of financial instruments, namely, currency and deposits, investments, loans and advances, small savings, life funds, provident funds, trade debts, foreign claims not elsewhere classified (NEC) and other claims not elsewhere classified. This article presents an analysis of the FoF accounts for the fiscal year 2012-13 along with revised/updated data for 2011-12.
Main Findings:
Aggregate funds raised by all sectors declined as a ratio of net national product (NNP) for the second consecutive year in 2012-13, reflecting the deceleration in economic activity; as a result, the finance ratio – ratio of total financial claims to net national product (NNP), the financial interrelations ratio – ratio of total issues to net domestic capital formation, and the new issues ratio – ratio of primary issues to net domestic capital formation, dipped below their levels a year ago.
The overall resource gap of the domestic economy (i.e., the current account deficit), as a proportion to NNP, widened over the previous year (2011-12), mainly reflecting the spill-over of the public sector deficit since the financial surplus of the household sector remained more or less unchanged and the financial deficit of the private corporate sector declined.
In contrast to the reduction in financial claims of PCB, banking, and the (central) government sectors, financial claims issued by the ROW sector increased as a proportion to NNP during the year.
There was a substantial increase in the share of the ROW sector (via foreign investment and loans) in the financing of the PCB sector’s deficit; the share of the banking sector also increased while that of the OFIs declined.
The share of OFIs in financing the resource gap of the government sector increased sharply during 2012-13.
With outflows under small savings significantly lower and accruals under government provident and pension funds higher in 2012-13, the share of households in funding the resource gap of the government sector also increased.
Net financial claims issued by the ROW sector picked up mainly on account of accretion to the foreign exchange reserves; net financial assets of the ROW sector also increased in 2012-13, mostly on the PCB sector.
Instrument-wise financial flows during 2012-13 showed that loans and advances remained the most preferred instrument, followed by investments, currency and deposits.
In the accompanying Statements 1 to 9, data on instrument-wise FOF accounts for each of the sectors are presented in Statements 1 to 6; the annual inter-sectoral flows are summarised for the years 2010-11 to 2012-13 in Statements 7.1 to 7.3; instrument-wise financial flows are summarised for each year separately in Statements 8.1 to 8.3; and the details of the resource gap/ financial surplus of the PCB Sector, Government Sector and the Household Sector are given in Statements 9.1 to 9.3, respectively.
Survey of Professional Forecasters: 2014-15
The Reserve Bank has been conducting Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) since September 2007 at quarterly intervals till March 2014. From 2014-15, the survey has been made bi-monthly in line with the change in monetary policy review to a two-monthly cycle. This article presents the results of SPF for the years 2014-15 and 2015-16 based on the 30th Round of the Survey conducted during September 2014. The performance of quarterly growth and inflation forecasts has been evaluated. Finally, based on the forecast of probability distribution of GDP growth and inflation, uncertainty of forecasts has been estimated. It must be noted that the survey results are those of the respondents and are not necessarily shared by the Reserve Bank of India.
Main Findings:
Forecasters expect that Indian economy will grow by 5.5. per cent in 2014-15 and by 6.5 per cent in 2015-16.
Industry growth is expected to be 3.9 per cent in 2014-15, which is likely to improve to 5.0 per cent in 2015-16. Services sector is likely to grow by 7.0 per cent in 2014-15 and further by 7.6 per cent in 2015-16.
The Central Government fiscal deficit is expected at 4.2 per cent of GDP in 2014-15 and is likely to improve to 3.9 per cent of GDP in 2015-16.
The current account deficit is expected at 2.0 per cent of GDP in 2014-15 and at 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2015-16.
The medium and long-term inflation expectations, measured by both wholesale and consumer price indices, have moderated in the recent period.
Empirical results suggest decline in uncertainty at near forecast horizon. Further, the extent of uncertainty has declined in the recent round as compared to the earlier round across the forecast horizons.
Developments in India's Balance of Payments during the First Quarter (April - June) of 2014-15
Highlights:
India’s balance of payments improved in Q1 of 2014-15, with the current account deficit (CAD) narrowing on a contraction of the trade deficit.
During Q1 of 2014-15, net services receipts improved marginally on a pick-up in construction, financial services, telecommunication, computer and information services and other business services from their levels a year ago.
The net outflow of primary income, comprising investment income and compensation of employees, continued in Q1 of 2014-15.
Net receipts under secondary income, comprising mainly remittances, also exhibited some moderation in relation to their level a year ago.
There was a sharp contraction in the CAD in Q1 of 2014-15 to 1.7 per cent of GDP from 4.8 per cent in Q1 of 2013-14.
Net capital flows were driven by robust FDI inflows and a sharp turnaround in FII inflows, particularly in the debt segment.
These developments resulted in an accretion to India’s foreign exchange reserves (on BoP basis) to the tune of US$ 11.2 billion in Q1 of 2014-15.
India’s External Debt at end of June 2014
Highlights:
India’s external debt at end-June 2014 was placed at US$ 450.1 billion (23.2 per cent of GDP), recording an increase of US$ 7.9 billion (1.8 per cent) over its level at end-March 2014. Four-fifth of the increase in external debt up to end-June 2014 was on account of external commercial borrowings, followed by non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits.
Instrument-wise across borrower categories, the overall outstanding debt of both Government and non-Government sectors increased, but there has been a shift towards long-term debt; in the case of the Government, in fact, short-term debt declined.
The external debt to GDP ratio declined and this improvement was also evident in a range of indicators, including the ratio of India’s foreign exchange reserves to total external debt.

OPEC cuts 2015 demand forecast for its oil to lowest in a decadeOPEC cuts 2015 demand forecast for its oil to lowest in a decade
Reuters | London Dec 11, 2014 10:01 AM IST
Global demand for OPEC crude in 2015 is expected to fall to the lowest level in more than a decade and far below current output, the group said on Wednesday, pointing to a hefty supply surplus without OPEC output cuts or a slowdown in the US shale boom.
In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) forecast demand for the group's oil will drop to 28.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2015, down 280,000 bpd from its previous expectation and over 1 million bpd less than it is currently producing.
The report follows OPEC's decision last month not to try and prop up prices by cutting output. Top exporter Saudi Arabia urged fellow members to combat the growth in US shale oil, which needs relatively high prices to be economic and has been eroding OPEC's market share.
OPEC's Nov. 27 decision to retain its output target of 30 million bpd sent prices plunging. Brent crude on Wednesday was trading below $66 a barrel, close to a five-year low and down more than 40% since June.
The report cut its forecast for growth in global demand in 2015 due to a weaker outlook for Europe and Asia, and predicted higher supply growth from shale and other non-OPEC sources, although it said this may be slowed if prices stay weak.
"Should the current fall in crude prices continue over a longer period, it will impact the non-OPEC supply forecast for 2015, especially anticipated growth in tight crude," OPEC's report said, using another term for shale oil.
For now though, OPEC's report indicates that, with OPEC pumping 30.05 million bpd in November according to secondary sources cited by the report, there will be a surplus of 1.13 million bpd in 2015, and 1.83 million bpd in the first half.
Next year's average demand for OPEC crude is expected to be the lowest since 28.15 million bpd in 2004, using the December reports published on OPEC's web site each year as a comparison.
According to the secondary-source figures, OPEC output fell by 390,000 bpd from October, largely because of unrest in Libya and smaller reductions in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia told OPEC it trimmed production by 80,000 bpd - a reduction that industry sources said earlier this month probably reflects lower domestic demand in power plants rather than a cut in exports.
OPEC expects non-OPEC supply to rise by 1.36 million bpd in 2015, led by the United States. The forecast was raised by 120,000 bpd from last month's report.
The producer group trimmed its forecast for global oil demand growth. It expects demand to rise by 1.12 million bpd next year, or 70,000 bpd less than previously thought.

Kashmir has rejected violence: ModiPrint
Vijaypur (Jammu and Kashmir), Dec 8 (IANS) The people of Jammu and Kashmir have rejected violence as there as heavy voter turnout in the first two phases of the assembly elections has shown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said and lauded their "unflinching faith in democracy".
Modi Monday sought a decisive mandate for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state assembly elections and launched a scathing attack on the Congress, National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Addressing a BJP poll campaign rally at Raya Morh in the Vijaypur  assembly constituency of Samba district, Modi said the people of the state have rejected violence as more people had pressed the EVM buttons during the first two phases of the state elections than have ever used their fingers to press the AK-47 triggers here.
"I salute the people of J&K a thousand times for their unflinching faith in democracy," he said, a day ahead of the third round of the five-phase assembly polls.
The elections began Nov 25 and end Dec 20. The vote count takes place Dec 23.
Modi said the Congress, the NC and the PDP have ruled Jammu and Kashmir during different periods in the past and the problems of the state are due to the misgovernance and nepotism by these parties.
Modi paid tributes to the brave soldiers who have been laying down their lives for the sovereignty and integrity of the country.
"I am addressing you from the land where Brigadier Rajender Singh was born and who laid down his life fighting the enemies of the country in Uri in 1947. I offer tribute to that brave son of the soil."
"I am wearing the turban today which was worn by Pandit Prem Nath Dogra (founder of Jana Sangh in the state) and I ask you to keep the honour of this turban," Modi said.
"I promise you the love you have been giving me will be returned with interest to you through the development of this state, but you must give a decisive mandate to the BJP for fulfilling this promise," he said.
More than 50,000 people attended the BJP rally here.
The prime minister said in the past it has been the Congress, the father and son party (NC), and the father and daughter party (PDP) that ruled the state.
"Did all of them do anything for you in the past? Would they do it in the future? You have tried them and they have failed you," he said.
He attacked the Congress, saying the party aligned with the NC when it needed to share power with them and later stabbed the NC in the back.
"Before that, they shared power with the PDP and when people asked them to give account of their misdoings, the Congress withdrew from that alliance too. Now the Congress is fighting elections against both these parties, saying all the misgovernance during the past was because of the NC and the PDP," Modi said.
"We need to ask the Congress what had they been doing...," he said.
The prime minister said there are 12 lakh refugees who were forced to come to Jammu and Kashmir at different periods of time in the past.
"I promise that we will rehabilitate these refugees and rehabilitation is their right which they will get," he asserted.
He said the parties who ruled the state in the past never treated the Jammu region as a part of the state.
"The BJP believes in equal opportunity for everybody. We believe in inclusive growth and development. You give me your support, I will give you equal opportunities for development," he said.
Modi said people need employment, irrigation for their agricultural fields and better healthcare facilities for the elderly.

J&K:Will a record turnout in polls change anythingJ&K Polls
(Walking through a thick…)
Amid historic turnouts and PM Modi's first political rally in Srinagar, life for the ordinary Kashmiri hasn't changed much. Walking through a thick fog of despair, Kashmiris are still looking for a destination that will provide them some comfort and succour. ET gets you the inside glimpses into life as it dwells in the valley:
Has God's vintage loneliness turned to vinegar?
NAINA DAR, a teacher. A Pandit whose family never left the valley
She is 26 and she feels desolate, residing in a village 20 km from Srinagar. When the troubles broke out, her father's uncle just refused to leave their ancestral house and migrate. So, they are still there - representing a community that left, bag and baggage, the valley 25 years ago.
I miss them, she says. There is a deep loneliness I feel sometimes. Her voice quivers a bit. Muslims have never troubled us, she says, and I have many Muslim friends. She teaches at a private school and her students are all Muslims. Outside, as people line up to cast their vote, Naina says it is all a sham. People are disenchanted; they are fed up. They want azaadi, she says. So much military, so many guns, so much fear, so much anxiety. What will she do if there is azaadi?
Then, she says in a voice full of emotion, India. What else? Although she hates India. Because India and its callous authorities didn't do anything when her father went missing. And he has been gone for more than 3 years. Just vanished. No one knows where. He had, her eyes here tearing up a bit, gone to Jammu to get his slice of the package the government had announced for the Kashmiri Pandits. He never came back. He became a package, of documents and evidences Naina still carries in the hope of meeting her father.
Her brother, she says, works in Jammu. He was depressed for a long time after their father disappeared. Naina knows her deep links to the valley will eventually be cut off through the knot of marriage. There are no pandits here, she says, a shy smile forming on her lips. If I get married, I will have to go out. Until then, Naina lives among Muslims, her Kashmiriyat and her determination a symbol of hope. Many would call the hope vague, but it still gives meaning to Naina's life.
From windows we hear grieving mothers, and snow begins to fall on us, like ash
HARMEET SINGH, SP, East Srinagar
His iPhone6 keeps constantly ringing and once he controls his irritation, he guffaws into it. Solidly built with an easy manner, Harmeet Singh's chamber is cavernous and zealously guarded, and he sits beneath a black wooden board that displays the names of his illustrious predecessors in pale yellow lettering.
Singh, a Kashmiri Sikh from militant-infested Tral, is the superintendent of police, east Srinagar. He is comfortable in many languages of the region and sometimes, amid beaming smiles, lets in an imprecation or two in colourful Punjabi. Kashmir is a conflict zone, he says, and the police have to take care, always.
Being a Sikh, he has never faced any problem in the valley, and he has been posted to all the hotspots. Kashmir now has the problem of quality, not quantity, militancy. We have got smarter in pursuing them; the militants, too, have got smarter in escaping our constant vigil and hiding themselves well.
Making plans for the prime minister's rally, Singh says, the police are bound tightly by the rules and can't go beyond a point. Politicians, he says, have to demonstrate the will to rehabilitate militants. There is deep anguish and much anger against the establishment and political parties haven't done enough to assuage the despair of the people. Singh, who has struck down 300 militants in his 10-year career, says the valley's troubles will continue because the resentments are many. Even a small protest about bijli-paani-sadak, he says, easily devolves into insistent demands for azaadi.
In a persistently bleak anti-establishment scenario, Singh continues to serve the establishment with affability that is momentarily broken only when his other phone starts trilling.
In this country we step out with doors in our arms. Children run out with windows in their arms
MOHAMMED WAHEED
In his red uniform, he is fidgety and avoids eye contact. Crumpled trousers and soiled shoes tell a straight story of poverty. His name is Mohammed Waheed and he is just 19, but at times he has to work 24x7. Nervous, polite and shy, his passion for azaadi is undimmed.
He wants it and so do many of his young friends in Tangmarg. My elders, he says without much nuance, say Modi will withdraw Article 370 and Indians will buy out Kashmir. He hasn't figured out how this will work, but he is convinced Team Modi wants to snatch azaadi away from him and his friends.

High turnout may neutralize BJP s Kashmiri pandit postal votesBaramulla
(Barring a petrol bomb attack,…)
SRINAGAR: Fifty-eight per cent polling in 16 seats known for poll boycott is unlikely to bring good news to BJP as the relatively larger turnout could more than neutralise postal votes of migrant Pandits the party banks on to open its account in the Kashmir Valley.
The third phase of assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir which concluded peacefully on Tuesday saw improved polling percentage across seats, including Sopore and Tral, compared to the Lok Sabha polls Syed Ali Geelani has represented Sopore thrice. After militancy set in, majority of voters in this constituency have stayed away from polls.
Tuesday's 30 per cent is relatively high after the seat recorded 8.09 per cent in 2002 and 19.95 per cent in 2008. Sopore's percentage for the 2104 Lok Sabha polls was 1.03 per cent. Tral is militancy-infested and has similarly seen low polling percentage: 11.54 per cent in 2002 and barely 1.53 per cent in the Lok Sabha polls. But this time it was 37.68 per cent, though lower than the 2008 assembly figure of 48.69 per cent.
While voters in this round of 16 seats barely participated in the last Lok Sabha polls, a comparison with 2008 assembly polls suggests massive improvement in 11/16 seats. Better participation by the state's majority community is likely to see BJP's plans of winning the Tral seat on the strength of postal ballots from migrant Kashmir Pandits thwarted. BJP had supported Sajjad Lone-led Peoples Conference in Sopore and fielded a Sikh in Tral. Details available with the Election Commission suggest that the postal ballots too have not been up to BJP's expectations.
The 16 seats with a cumulative voter population of 13,69,102 included 19,575 migrant votes. But only 8,168 migrant voters secured the M-form, a prerequisite for postal ballot. "Though the final figure may vary, only 55 per cent of those with M-form have actually voted," Chief Electoral Officer Umang Narula said.
The turnout in the thrid-phase elections was less compared to the first two phases which recorded 72 per cent. Voting has been completed in 49 of the 87 assembly constituencies. The fourth and fifth phase will be held on December 14 and 20, respectively. Counting of votes will be taken up on December 23. Barring a petrol bomb attack by some unidentified persons at a polling station in Gulmarg , the polling was by and large peaceful in all the constituencies in Baramulla , Pulwama and Budgam districts of north, south and central Kashmir.
Voters including elderly persons lined up at 1,781 polling stations in sub-zero temperatures at many places in the morning to decide the fate of 144 candidates including Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and three of his cabinet colleagues.

J&K polls: Record voting in troubled  remote regionsBaramullah
(As has been the practice…)
SOPORE/BARAMULLAH: For years, Sopore was the most prominent example of stubborn defiance to Indian elections in Kashmir. Being the hometown of the valley's most influential hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani . Voting here was seen as an act of sacrilege and mass boycott largely the norm.
With unprecedented number of voters coming out to vote during earlier phases of the ongoing assembly elections, several key bastions of anti-India separatism appear to be gradually changing their view about participating in state elections.
On Tuesday, as the valley's voters woke up to a chilly morning and lined up outside booths much before polling began for the tensest phase yet of the five phase elections, predictable tensions erupted in Baramullah, the district with the most number of seats going to polls.
As has been the practice for years, large parts of the towns of Baramullah and Sopore were shut down with intermittent spells of stone pelting in several areas. Even Palhallan, a part of the nearby Pattan constituency, saw similar scenes play out through the day. A petrol bomb attack reported in Gulmarg, part of the same district, also seemed to suggest that the militant hotbeds will follow a familiar script on polling in these areas. But beyond these islands of chaos, quietly a section of resolute Kashmiris was voting.
Resident of Takyabal locality in Sopore, Noor Mohammad said he never voted before but came with his family this time. "We respect Geelani saab and agree with his stand on Aazadi. But this time one of our own is contesting and, not voting hasn't helped us in any way, at least getting a neighbour elected may help. My house was damaged during floods and all I got was Rs 3,800, I am sure Irshad Kar will help us," he said.

Hong Kong protest camp counts down final hoursBy: Associated Press | Hong Kong |
Posted: December 10, 2014 1:10 pm
Hong Kong’s dwindling number of pro-democracy protesters vowed Wednesday to stay until the last minute before authorities clear them off a highway where they’ve been camped out for more than two months.
Dozens of activists and hundreds of tents remained on the normally busy thoroughfare outside of city government headquarters less than a day before police are scheduled to sweep them out.
Many other supporters as well as tourists and office workers visited the site for one final photo opportunity as a reminder of what’s come to be known as the “Umbrella Movement.”
Hong Kong’s second-highest ranking government official stepped up calls for protesters to leave the site. Chief Secretary Carrie Lam warned people not to heed calls by student leaders urging those who had turned out for the movement’s early stages to return to the scene.
“This is most undesirable, because once the police operation is underway, and knowing very well that there are some radical elements amongst the protesters, confrontation might become inevitable,” Lam said.
The government said the headquarters complex would shut down for the day and 3,000 staff would not need to come to work while the police carry out their operation.
The protesters began occupying the road in the Admiralty district and two other neighborhoods on Sept. 28 after police fired tear gas in a failed attempt to disperse them.
The demonstrators are demanding greater democratic reform than Beijing is prepared to allow Hong Kong.

Gold prices today soared by Rs 650 to Rs 27,470 per ten gram in the bullion market here on strong seasonal demand and firm trends in global markets. Silver also rose sharply by Rs 1,600 to Rs 38,400 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
A fall in rupee value against the US dollar and increased buying by jewellers and retailers amid ongoing wedding season lifted prices of the precious metal, bullion traders said. A cheaper rupee makes imports of the metal costlier. The rupee was trading weak at 62.05 against the US dollar at the forex market.

03:00pm Coal linkage rationalisation soon
The government could soon finalise the proposal for coal linkage rationalisation and swapping arrangements of about 40 thermal power projects, a move that is expected to save up to Rs 6,000 crore in logistics cost.
The proposal includes swapping agreements for power projects of companies including Adani Power, Indiabulls Power and NTPC, among others.
The Inter Ministerial Task Force (IMTF), which was formed to undertake a comprehensive review of existing coal sources and consider feasibility for rationalisation of linkages, has approved coal linkage rationalisation for 18-20 thermal power plants, according to sources.
IMTF comprises officials from the Ministries of Power, Coal, Railways and the Central Electricity Authority.
Sources said, consultancy firm KPMG has listed out 20 proposals for the coal swapping arrangements.

Looking to cash in on e-commerce boom, Reliance Capital is all set to sell its 16 percent stake in leading travel portal Yatra.com for an estimated Rs 500 crore and is in talks with 2-3 international investors.
The deal would mark an over 12-times appreciation for this investment by Reliance Capital, the financial services arm of Anil Ambani-led business conglomerate Reliance Group, which had acquired a 16 percent stake in the online travel company for Rs 40 crore in 2006.
Sources said that Reliance Cap is in talks with 2-3 leading international investors to sell this 16 per cent stake for an estimated USD 80 million (about Rs 500 crore). The identity of the interested buyers could not be ascertained, reports PTI.
When contacted, a Reliance Capital spokesperson said: "We continuously evaluate opportunities to unlock the value of our minority investments to enhance shareholders value."

Talking about China, the Shanghai closed in the green, bouncing back in late trade after falling initially. The economic data continued to be weak as China November consumer inflation eased to 5-year low of 1.4 percent stoking expectations that Beijing will move more aggressively to head off the risk of deflation in a slowing economy.

Coal stock shortages ease at thermal power stationsCoal stock shortages ease at thermal power stations

Coal shortages in domestic power stations eased as the number of thermal power plants with less than seven days of coal stocks fell to 50 last week, down from 61 in early November, government data showed on Wednesday.
Earlier, coal supply shortages threatened to stoke a power crisis in the country.
Twenty eight of the power stations had less than four days coal supplies on December 4, down from 35 on November 2, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) said.
On an average, 100 power plants had enough coal to last a week on December 4, CEA said, far below the 15-30 days the electricity body sets as an operating norm.
However, cooler seasonal weather in December has reduced demand for power and eased concerns of widespread blackouts.
The country, which relies on coal for about three-fifths of its energy needs , is turning to increased coal imports because of insufficient domestic mining, despite holding the world's fifth-largest reserves of the fossil fuel.

Ericssons 10 hot consumer trends for 2015: Integrating connectivity into daily lifeRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
Ericsson ConsumerLab’s annual report shows that consumers want technology and connectivity to be integrated into all facets of daily life – in everything from bathroom mirrors, to sidewalks and medicine jars
Consumers are becoming more comfortable with ideas that once seemed beyond imagination – like robots in the home and mind sharing.
In 2015, consumers will watch streamed video more often than broadcast TV.
The fourth edition of Ericsson ConsumerLab’s annual trend report charts the hottest consumer trends for 2015 and beyond.
The insights in the report “10 hot consumer trends for 2015 and beyond” come from Ericsson ConsumerLab’s global research program, with a special focus this year on smartphone owners aged 15 to 69 in Johannesburg, London, Mexico City, New York, Moscow, San Francisco, Sâo Paulo, Shanghai, Sydney and Tokyo – statistically representing the views of 85 million frequent internet users.
These are the 10 hot consumer trends for 2015 and beyond:
1. The streamed future. Media use patterns are globalizing. Viewers are shifting towards easy-to-use on-demand services that allow cross-platform access to video content. 2015 will be historic as more people will watch streamed video on a weekly basis than broadcast TV.
2. Helpful homes. Consumers show high interest in having home sensors that alert them to water and electricity issues, or when family members come and go.
3. Mind sharing. New ways to communicate will continue to appear, offering us even more ways to keep in touch with our friends and family. Many smartphone owners would like to use a wearable device to communicate with others directly through thought – and believe this will be mainstream by 2020.
4. Smart citizens. The idea of smart cities is intriguing – but a lot of that intelligence may actually come about as a side effect of the changing everyday behaviors of citizens. As the internet makes us more informed, we are in turn making better decisions. Consumers believe traffic volume maps, energy use comparison apps and real-time water quality checkers will be mainstream by 2020.
5. The sharing economy. As the internet enables us to efficiently share information with unprecedented ease, the idea of a sharing economy is potentially huge. Half of all smartphone owners are open to the idea of renting out their spare rooms, personal household appliances and leisure equipment as it is convenient and can save money.
6. The digital purse. 48 percent of smartphone owners would rather use their phone to pay for goods and services. 80 percent believe that the smartphone will replace their entire purse by 2020.
7. My information. Although sharing information when there is a benefit is fine, smartphone owners see no point in making all of their actions open to anyone. 47 percent of smartphone owners would like to be able to pay electronically without an automatic transfer of personal information. 56 percent of smartphone owners would like all internet communication to be encrypted.
8. Longer life. Smartphone owners see cloud-based services of various kinds giving them the potential to live healthier and longer lives. Jogging apps, pulse meters and plates that measure our food are believed to help prolong our lives by up to two years per application.
9. Domestic robots. Consumers are welcoming the idea of having domestic robots that could help with everyday chores. 64 percent also believe this will be common in households by 2020.
10. Children connect everything. Children will continue to drive the demand for a more tangible internet, where the physical world is as connected as the screens of their devices. 46 percent of smartphone owners say that children will expect all objects to be connected when they are older.

Congress made guru a scapegoat to stop BJP: Mufti Mohammad SayeedPress Trust of India | Dec 10, 2014 at 06:54pm IST
Srinagar: PDP patron Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on Wednesday alleged that former Congress-led UPA government at the Centre used Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru as a scapegoat in its failed bid to stop the rise of BJP at the national level.
"Congress played a counter-communal card in its failed bid to stop the rise of BJP at the national level and they used Afzal Guru as a scapegoat," Sayeed said while addressing an election rally in Dooru assembly segment of south Kashmir.
The Peoples Democratic Party leader said Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, who owed his "survival" in 2010 and 2011 to Congress, readily agreed to hanging Guru out of turn in a manner that does not do any good to the image of the country as a secular democracy where rule of law is supreme.
Sayeed said ideologically Congress never tried to rise up to the BJP but instead made compromise after compromise to seek survival in power.
"Congress and National Conference just for their partisan politics sacrificed the image of the country and subverted its system by not allowing Guru's family to have at least last minute meeting with him," he said.
He said ideologically Congress never tried to rise up to the BJP but instead made compromise after compromise to seek survival in power which ultimately demolished it at the national level and in the state it was reduced to hand-maiden of Omar Abdullah.
The former Chief Minister said Congress and National Conference are to be equally blamed for landing Jammu and Kashmir in one of the worst "governance crisis" of its history.
"It was because of Congress abandoning its inclusive agenda at the national level and its ministers indulging in open loot and frauds in the state that space for emergence of BJP was created in J&K," Sayeed said.
Sayeed said Omar on the strength of his friendship with Congress Vice president Rahul Gandhi had his way on all matters without being able to do anything constructive for the state.
During the past six years, he said the functionaries of NC-Congress coalition worked as a "mutual benefit society" which had no direction and no Common Minimum Programme (CMP) for the welfare of the people.
The PDP patron said it was the Congress high command and its ministers in the coalition government who bailed out Omar Abdullah in 2010 when hundreds of youth were killed and thousands framed in false charges by his government.
"Similarly in 2011 Haji Yousuf case it was a Congress minister who supported Omar Abdullah more than his NC colleagues," he said.
Sayeed said PDP would try to form a government that would be inclusive and would reflect the urges and aspirations of all sections of the society across all the regions of the state.

Rupee falls 14 pts against dollar  ends at 1-week low of 62.02Forex Update: Rupee falls 14 pts against dollar, ends at 1-wk low of 62.02

In a dull trade, the rupee dropped further by 14 paise to close at more-than one-week low of 62.02 against the Greenback following sustained dollar demand from importers amid fresh capital outflows, extending losses for the third straight day.
Some hesitancy in local equities and mostly stable dollar overseas has no major impact on the rupee, a dealer said.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced lower at 61.96 a dollar from previous close of 61.88.
It was later trapped in a narrow range of 61.91 and 62.0475 before settling at 62.02, a net fall of 14 paise or 0.23 pct. In three days in a row, it has dipped by 25 paise or 0.40 pct.
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex recovered marginally by 34.09 points or 0.12 pct in a choppy trade while FPIs/FIIs pulled out USD 35.99 mln yesterday, as per Sebi data.
Mr. Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said,"Rupee continues to be on a weaker side. Today also Rupee depreciated by fourteen paise. Rupee has traded weak for the third consecutive day and now investors are waiting for the U.S data which is due for the week. The outcome of the data will show the road ahead to the market."
"The trading range for the Spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 61.70 to 62.30" he added.
In forward market, premia softened further on persistent receipts by exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in May moved down to 214-216 paise from Tuesday's close of 215-217 paise.
Forward contracts maturing in November 2015 also slipped to 423-425 paise from 424.5-426.5 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.95 and for the Euro at 76.7499.
The rupee remained weak against the pound to 97.22 from 96.80 previously and declined further to 76.79 per euro from 76.47.
It, also dropped to 52.02 per 100 Japanese yen from 51.59.

Bali pact was imperfect, needed correction: Minister
Government today said it has protected the interest of Indian farmers by ensuring correction in WTO's Bali agreement which was "imperfect".
Post your opinion here
 
Government today said it has protected the interest of Indian farmers by ensuring correction in WTO's Bali agreement which was "imperfect".
Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also rejected the opposition charge in the Rajya Sabha that India had lost friends in the process of the WTO talks.
"We are very clearly saying, Bali was imperfect ... It was an imperfect agreement. It required a course correction and it was that course correction that this government had engaged in from July," she said replying to clarifications on her statement on "India's stand on WTO" made on November 28.
Asserting that the government was ensuring that India's sovereign right is strengthened, she said, "If there are any corrections to be made in the process, we as a government, representing people of India, have a sovereign duty to do the course correction and ensure that our farmers or any such interests are kept intact and protected."
To opposition charge that India had gone into WTO talks like 'Abhimanyu', she said, "I would like to tell you here in no uncertain terms that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi we have got in as an Abhimanyu but we came out successfully with 160 friends, building on our predecessor, who had 93 friends."
Seeking clarifications on the minister's statement on WTO, opposition members said it was "confusing" and hoped India's interests and sovereignty would not be compromised on the signing of the trade agreement.
Members also sought to know if India had decided to go along with USA and in the bargain lost its friends among the group of developing nations, which India was leading.
Anand Sharma (Cong), who has been a former Commerce Minister accused the minister of "misleading" the House and the country and challenged her saying the work on delinking negotiations on public stock holding for food subsidy purposes was arrived at Bali.
He said the minister has sought to create an impression as if the agreement at Geneva was the outcome of efforts made only by the new government and Prime Minister, which was not the case.
The only difference made is that the deadline for putting in place programmes on food subsidies by seven months from December 2014 to July 2015, he said.
Sitharaman clarified that it was a new decision because Bali Ministerial decision of December 7, 2013 said, "Members agreed to put in place an interim mechanism...to negotiate an agreement for a permanent solution to be found" whereas on November 27, 2014, it decided and extended peace clause for perpetuity.
"Let us be clear. This is a new decision with a new date...The ambiguity which prevailed has been removed...2014 agreement has an accelerated mechanism for permanent solution and there will be dedicated sessions for solving agriculture related problems," she said replying to clarification sought by Sharma whether it was a new agreement or old.
Allaying fears of the opposition that government may not consult them during permanent solution, the Commerce Minister said, "When a permanent solution is worked out, it will be agreed upon by all."
FTA, she said will result in reduction of cost of imports and ports will be able to carry more business benefitting the economy.
On members' concern that issues like subisidies by advanced nations were not raised in the meets, Sitharaman said, "We have periodically raised the issue and will continue to raise it. USA spends USD 120 billion on it adn so is the EU."
She said the government will make all efforts to reach a permanent solution "and would just not sit back because peace clause has been extended...We shall put the national interest on top."
"We may be dealing with FTAs but we strongly support multi-lateralism," she added.
She also quoted a Tamil poet to assure the House that common man's interest would not be compromised and "BJP and India has gone to WTO to fight for the right of comman man."
For Doha round, she said the agenda included issues like agriculutre, industrial goods."
Sharma said, "The entire claim of a new decision and a major breakthrough is not right...This House should not be misled. It may have been inadvertent but now it will be deliberate. Either my statement was wrong and in that case I am ready to face a privilege against me."
Derek O'Brien (TMC) said the WTO agreement is a "half solution" and asked why the minister did not press for a permanent solution.
"This is short term gains but long term pain," he said, seeking to know how the free trade agreements will help growth in manufacturing sector in the country.
He sought continuation of the minimum support price, saying it is the lifeline of millions of farmers.
Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M) said there is concern about the agreement as India, which follows the price-related subsidy under MSP regime, will have to be done away with as it disturbs the international trade.
"If subsidies are sought to be delinked from the pricing mechanism, cash subsidies will create havoc with our system... This particular issue of accepting the linkages is something alien to us and I have serious objections to this that will put our farmers in jeopardy. Given one bad monsoon, the fate of millions of farmers will be put in jeopardy," he said.
D Raja (CPI) said the struggle at WTO is between the developed and the developing countries and what is the role India is playing in uniting the developing world, while seeking to know whether India was succumbing to US pressure or US was succumbing to India.
"Whether we are leaving our allies in WTO, the developing countries...? What is the position of India? India should clear its position on what we are doing on WTO. India has to play a pro-active role in uniting the developing countries," he said.
He said nothing should be deterimental to interests of the country while seeking to know how the government intended to integrate free trade agreements with multi-lateral agreements.
K C Tyagi (JD-U) termed the WTO as a centre of "looting" the third-world countries and said the government should have consulted opposition parties and all stakeholders before going ahead with the WTO negotiations.
The JD-U member lauded the role played by RSS-affiliated organisations like Swadeshi Jagran Manch, Krishi Utpadak Sangathan, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh for opposing the WTO pact in national interest.
"Agriculture will be ruined in the country. This (WTO) is a black law, don't allow it to come here," he said, giving a call to all farmer-friendly parties including NDA ally Shiromani Akali Dal to come together against the pact.
Sukhendu Shekhar Roy (TMC) said doing away with farm subsidies under the WTO was a "national concern" and the expected result is "very much gloomy" and advocated a change in the WTO rules.
"Member countries will also have the right to scrutinise any country and can intrude...internal policy matters will be subject to scrutiny. The country's sovereignty will be compromised," he said, adding that the agreement once signed will put a ceiling on freedom of all future governments to not announce any food subsidy programmes.
Navneethkrishnan (AIADMK) sought to know why the government was not able to provide subsidies to farmers while Satish Chandra Misra (BSP) asked whether special or different mechanism was adopted for other goods.
EMS Natchiappan (Cong) alleged that the government was going to allow flooding of 75 per cent of the market with agriculutural productions from world which would be a catastrophe for agriculture in India.
A B Rapolu (Cong) and Kanimozhi (DMK) sought to know how will the government protect the interests of farmers.
Bhupinder Singh (BJD) urged the government to "increase the minimum support price for farmers "if you are not able to protect subsidy."

The Cabinet tonight approved the insurance amendment bill with a composite foreign investment cap of 49 percent for presenting it in Parliament, incorporating the changes suggested by a House panel.
The Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved incorporation of amendments suggested by a Parliamentary select panel in the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008, sources said.
The Rajya Sabha is likely to take up the Bill for consideration and passage next week.
Earlier today, the Select Committee in its report to the Rajya Sabha had suggested hike in composite foreign investment limit in insurance sector to 49 percent which would include Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as well as portfolio investment.
At present only 26 percent FDI is allowed in private sector insurance companies. The hike in foreign investment limit is estimated to attract about Rs 25,000 crore of overseas funds in the sector.
"The Committee recommends that the composite cap of 49 percent should be inclusive of all forms of foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investments," the report said.
The Congress support for the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008, is crucial as the ruling NDA does not have majority in the Upper House.
The bill, which has been pending since 2008, may not have a smooth ride in the Rajya Sabha with certain political parties opposing further opening of the insurance sector to foreign investment.

To encourage indigenous manufacturing of seaplanes, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari today mooted the idea of joint ventures in which global companies can hold majority stake.
Seaplanes are aircraft that can land and take off from water.
"If we start manufacturing seaplanes in India by inviting international firms, we can bring the capital cost down," he said here.
If the global companies are allowed to hold 51 per cent and the remaining 49 per cent stays with the government the arrangement could prove beneficial, he added.
The government is also planning a Waterport Authority of India to facilitate plying of seaplanes.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Select Committee in its report to the Rajya Sabha had suggested hike in composite foreign investment limit in insurance sector to 49 per cent which would include Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as well as portfolio investment.
At present only 26 per cent FDI is allowed in private sector insurance companies. The hike in foreign investment limit is estimated to attract about Rs 25,000 crore of overseas funds in the sector.
"The Committee recommends that the composite cap of 49 per cent should be inclusive of all forms of foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investments," the report said.
The Congress support for the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008, is crucial as the ruling NDA does not have majority in the Upper House.
The bill, which has been pending since 2008, may not have a smooth ride in the Rajya Sabha with certain political parties opposing further opening of the insurance sector to foreign investment.

Army fights misinformation campaign on Whatsapp

Srinagar: Battling a proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir, the Army now has to fight with a new problem of misinformation campaign on social media which appears to be a tough challenge.
It all began with Northern Army Commander Lt Gen DS Hooda admitting to the "mistake" by his personnel in killing of two civilians in Kashmir in November.
This led to a slew of reactions and Hooda had to write to his men saying "not to fall prey" to print, electronic and social media opinions.
Army believes that these were "misinformation campaign", possibly orchestrated from across the border to dampen the spirit of the force.
#army #social media #whatsapp #jammu and kashmir
He had also written, "Mistakes will happen. Let me assure you that I have a clear understanding of the difficulties under which we operate and that nobody will be unfairly harmed. This clear message must go out to all units. Our Army's ethic and values, backed by a strong military justice system, are the best in the world. These will serve to guide us and also protect us. You and your men are doing an outstanding job in the most exacting of circumstances and your well being is uppermost in my mind".
Following the recent terror attacks, a fresh wave of messages have started appearing attacking the Army leadership in the state and some of which were purportedly written by young officers.
Army believes that these were "misinformation campaign", possibly orchestrated from across the border to dampen the spirit of the force.
Now, a new Whatsapp message cropped up about a recent operation, saying that a particular officer was sidelined when it came to appreciation for saving "over 100" BRO personnel.
"These are all misinformation campaign. No Army personnel would ever share operational details and such misinformation on social media," sources said.
Asked about the latest message doing the rounds, Army sources said they checked with the said officer and he has denied that he had sent any such message.
They said it could be the handiwork of "a few disgruntled elements who might be vying for an award". They stressed that there was a need for a coherent policy on social media interactions.
A circular in this regard was issued two years back which had said "Facebook, Twitter and Orkut" were only meant for private conversations and not to discuss operational details.
"Data sent on these are unsecure as data can be intercepted," the circular read.

Noshir Kaka, MD of McKinsey India and Director, McKinsey Inc, is another jury member with a vantage position, as his firm has been helping a range of organisations - mid-sized to large private firms, state-owned companies and large, well-established multinationals - on issues relating to strategy, operations, etc.
The man who has advised and funded scores of Indian firms in making that transition is Sanjay Nayar, CEO of private equity giant KKR India. The former Citi India head brings to the table a mix of local understanding and global exposure.
Joining them in picking the best in corporate India is ace corporate lawyer Zia Mody, whose advice is sought by top businesses. Through the years, Mody, senior partner of AZB & Partners, has specialised in structuring some of the most complex merger and acquisition deals in India.
EY India CEO and Country Managing Partner Rajiv Memani has also been involved in several high-profile transactions in India and has pushed his firm, which is celebrating its 100th year in India, ahead in almost every practice. Memani has also been appointed on the global executive board of EY as chairman, emerging markets committee.
Watch this space on Monday for the names of the winners and how the jury arrived at the decisions.

Ola  Meru  TaxiForSure on low financial mileageOla, Meru, TaxiForSure on low financial mileage
Sounak Mitra & Digbijay Mishra | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 12:57 AM IST
Six weeks ago, Masayoshi Son, chairman of Japan’s SoftBank, announced his plan to invest in taxi service provider Ola Cabs, at a valuation of $1 billion. Son’s $210-million investment in Ola was the largest so far in an Indian cab service operator. The valuation did not appear incredibly high, given the market potential, which had drawn the likes of San Francisco-headquartered Uber — backed by investors such as Goldman Sachs, Google Ventures, Menlo, First Round, Lowercase Capital and Benchmark — to India.
However, for these companies, the reality appears to be far less rosy. Most taxi service providers, currently being probed following the alleged rape of a 27-year-old woman in Delhi by an Uber cab driver, are under financial stress.
For 2013-14, ANI Technologies, which runs Ola Cabs, reported a 50 per cent jump in net loss at Rs 34.21 crore, against Rs 22.80 crore in 2012-13, according to filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC).
TaxiForSure, also facing a nationwide ban, has widened its loss, too. Serendipity Infolabs, the holding company for TaxiForSure, reported a loss of Rs 17.08 crore for 2013-14, compared with a profit of Rs 3.02 crore the previous year.
For 2013-14, Meru Cab Company, which runs Meru Cabs, reported its maiden profit, of Rs 3.55 crore. In 2012-13, it had recorded a loss of Rs 31.11 crore. As of March-end this year, the company’s accumulated loss stood at Rs 215.24 crore.
Mega Cabs, which owns and has been operating taxis round the clock across six cities since 2001, reported a loss of Rs 2.55 crore on revenue of Rs 36.37 crore for 2013-14. The company, which claims to have the largest radio taxi network in India, had posted a net profit of Rs 12.18 lakh on revenue of Rs 39.55 crore the previous year.
In terms of revenue, Ola Cabs, backed by private equity funds Tiger Global and Matrix Partners, has reported solid growth. Its Rs 51-crore revenue in 2013-14 was 219 per cent higher than Rs 16 crore the previous financial year. TaxiForSure, backed by Hellion Ventures and Accel India, had revenue of Rs 4.29 crore in 2013-14; Meru Cabs did not disclose its revenue details.
There are 19 radio taxi operators in the country, including Mega Cabs, Easy Cabs, Meru Cabs and Tab Cabs, according to the Association of Radio Taxis. These operators run about 25,000 cabs across India, generating combined revenue of Rs 70,000-80,000 a cab every month, the association says.
Of these, Easy Cabs is operated by Carzonrent (India), which also has other businesses such as a personal ground transportation service.
It offers short- and long-term car rental solutions through its fleet of 6,500 cars.
Quick Cabs, which runs about 1,000 radio taxis in the National Capital region, had not filed financial details with RoC till the filing of this report.
Lately, India’s taxi services market, despite its financial stress, has received increased attention from global investors, primarily because of the fact that the ‘radio taxi’ model has emerged as the fastest-growing and most reliable form of public transport for the world’s second-largest population. There are about 600,000 taxis in India, generating combined annual revenue of about Rs 11,000 crore.

DIPP against allowing MNC manufacturers to sell online

(India does not allow FDI in…)
NEW DELHI: A budget proposal to draw multinationals to set up manufacturing facilities in the country by offering them the incentive of online retail appears to have hit a snag.
The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), the nodal body for foreign direct investment (FDI), has written to the finance ministry expressing issues in implementing the decision announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his budget speech. Adding to the already complex situation are representations made by brickand-mortar retailers after the much publicised mega sales by e-retailers, including Flipkart and Amazon .
India does not allow FDI in business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce, though it is permitted in business-to-business (B2B) ecommerce.
According to a finance ministry official, the DIPP has pointed out to the department of economic affairs in the finance ministry that moving ahead on the budget proposal could shift FDI emphasis away from brick-and-mortar retail that generate more jobs and compromise the objective of generating employment.
Foreign investment policy for B2C retail contains conditions aimed at strengthening manufacturing, especially the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector. In contrast, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's budget proposal would allow manufacturing entities with FDI unrestricted singleand multi-brand retail trading through the e-commerce route, the DIPP has pointed.
Moreover, the DIPP said it would be difficult to monitor whether manufacturing units having FDI, which are also into retailing, are actually engaged in manufacturing. Given the shorter gestation lag in retailing, FDI-recipient manufacturing units may engage in retailing of products that have not been manufactured in India.
In January, the DIPP had floated a discussion paper on FDI policy for e-commerce for public comments, but is yet to take a policy call on it.
In his budget speech on July 10, Jaitley had said that FDI in the manufacturing sector was in the automatic approval list and these units would be allowed to sell products through retail, including e-commerce platforms, without needing additional clearance.
Since several manufacturers sell through their online platforms, besides retail ventures, the announcement was essentially aimed at giving clarity in the policy and encouraging foreign manufacturers keen to sell online in mobile and consumer durable space to set up factories here.
The official quoted earlier said the finance ministry is in discussions with the DIPP to address its concerns and ensure implementation of the budget announcement. The budget announcement had generated interest among a number of brand owners who are keen to sell directly through online platforms, a mode that has gained popularity in India.
India's e-commerce industry is pegged at $10 billion and said to be growing at a scorching pace.
The new government is keen to kick-start the country's manufacturing sector, which contracted by 0.7% in 2013-14 and has launched a mega initiative—'the Make in India'.

Fashion e-tailers Jabong  Myntra put up impr...Amazon
(As Amazon chief Jeff Bezos had…)
MUMBAI: Just three years...and may be at the threshold of a revolution. Jabong and Myntra, India's biggest etailers of fashion, are clocking up impressive top line numbers and, more importantly, red hot 3-digit and 4-digit growth figures that signal a tipping point in how urban Indians will dress themselves — they will likely move most of their clothes shopping to ecommerce.
Consider the numbers. In three years of operations (2012-2014), Jabong and Myntra's combined top line has hit Rs 1,000 crore for the year ended March 2014. Growth has been more than blistering. Jabong sales in 2013-14 jumped to Rs 527 crore, from a mere Rs 4.6 crore in 2011-12 — that's an eyepopping 11,357 per cent growth in sales.
Myntra's Rs 441-crore top line in 2013-14 was an only slightly less staggering 558 per cent jump from 2011-12's Rs 67.1 crore.
And in these three years, Jabong's and Myntra's top lines have outperformed those of brick-and-mortar fashion biggies, Zara, Levis and Marks & Spencers, which have been in business in India for between 5 and 10 years.
Plus, growth in the big brickand-mortar chains, Shoppers Stop and Future Lifestyle Fashion, which have been in operations for two decades or more, has really slowed down in comparison, over the same period (see graphic).
As Amazon chief Jeff Bezos had said, the big success of fashion etailing is the biggest learning he's taken away from India.
And market analysts and fashion-conscious urban middle and upper middle classes are saying the same thing differently.
Analysts say a tipping point has been reached in etailing fashion.
Consumers say the sheer convenience of browsing through thousands of big label options from the comfort of one's home or office and the ease of returning clothes that don't fit are the reasons they will stay with buying a dress through a mouse click.
"Where will I get international brands such as Dorothy Perkins, Mango, FCUK, and not-so-highpriced Harpa and Femella all in one place? I won't ever get to browse 5,000 designs at stores and I can't go there every day braving the traffic. But I can go to the virtual store every single day and if I don't like what I have shopped, I can just return, all from the comfort of my chair," said Ruchi Sally, director at retail consultancy Elargir Solutions and an online shopper explaining the growth of online fashion retailers.
"Online retail has passed the inflection point as customers have stopped questioning its viability and authenticity," said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive at retail consultancy Third Eyesight.
Fashion etailers attribute their success to multiplier effect from good customer experience and some serious brand-building efforts.
"Apart from the acceptance of ecommerce at a macro-level, we have, over time, built our reputation through customer experience. This will now translate into higher sales as we laid a strong foundation," said Praveen Sinha, co-founder of Jabong. com. "There has been a lot of focus on branding and investment to build fashion properties and technology which will help in the long run even as though it impacts profitability now."
Jabong and Myntra also attribute their growth to an increase in its product portfolio and exclusive tieups, especially with international brands.
The Indian online retail market is estimated to grow over 4-fold to touch $14.5 billion (over Rs 88,000 crore) by 2018 on account of rapid expansion of ecommerce in the country, according to research and consultancy firm RNCOS that projects compound annual growth rate of 40-45 per cent during 2014-18. The current market size of the online retail sector has been pegged at $3.5 billion (over Rs 21,000 crore).
Fashion etailing, say market watchers, is poised to become the top category in the near future. RNCOS says while online sales account for nearly 4 per cent of the overall apparel market, as compared to 15 per cent for smartphones and between 5-10 per cent for flat panel televisions, digital cameras and personal care gadgets, the hierarchy is set to change.
"It is likely that few years down the line, apparel and accessories will take over the top slot from electronic gadgets," the RNCOS report said.
Fashion etailing in India, say pundits, is going through the classic ecommerce growth pattern at a quick pace. In a very short time, the likes of Jabong and Myntra have crossed the first two stages - attracting the first enthusiasts and seducing a wider set with product promotions. The third, really defining stage will come when clicking for a dress becomes an even wider habit.

Solar power can be for India what shale gas is for the USSolar power can be for India what shale is for the US

(The Centre should provide…)
By Akhil Gupta, Akhil Handa & Mayank Rawat
The new government has unfurled plans to build 100 gw of solar power by 2022. Here are a few suggestions to execute this grand vision:
First, it's time the general perception that solar energy is expensive is removed. India gets 70% more solar radiation than European countries. This means the same solar panels yield 70% more power in India. In addition, peak demand in India coincides for 70-80% of the time during which solar energy is harnessed. This peak demand is mostly met by diesel, which costs almost double that of solar electricity, currently at Rs 6-7 per kWh.
So, when we commission a solar plant, it will displace diesel for 70-80% of its generation and imported coal for the rest. At all times, solar is substituting for imported energy, which is far more expensive.
Second, adequate capital should be raised without crowding out investments in other sectors. The proposed 100 gw capacity requires about $125 billion, of which $90 billion will be debt financing. The global financial crisis has created a great opportunity for availing cheaper credit from global markets. As per International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates, green energy will receive almost 60% of the $5 trillion expected to be invested in new power plants over the next decade. Solar's requirement is less than 2% of this amount.
The Holy Grail of successful financing is effective allocation of risks between different stakeholders — in this case the consumer, the investor, central/state governments and the developer. The development cost and schedule risk are best borne by technically competent solar power developers once a power purchase agreement (PPA) is signed with a state electricity board (SEB). The developer is in the best situation to procure land, negotiate for panel prices with investors and execute the project expeditiously.
  Fortunately, solar power requires far fewer clearances than for coal and doesn't require contiguous land. The government should put a 25 mw per bid floor to ensure technical and financial competence of the bidder.
A big part of solar energy costs is the cost of debt, since fuel costs are zero and operational costs are minimal. Any action by government to reduce interest cost will reduce the cost of solar energy and accelerate its adoption. A foreign lender will view depreciation of currency as a risk since the tariff is designated in rupees and will want to be compensated for that higher risk.
The government/RBI should mitigate that risk away from foreign lenders. This potentially has no cost to the government/RBI since implementation of solar energy will contribute to the appreciation of the rupee. This is because we estimate forex savings of more than $500 billion over a 25-year period from the commissioning of 100 gw solar power and substituting the use of diesel and imported coal.
The developer is incurring a major portion of costs in dollars, but is shielding the consumer from rupee depreciation risk by designating the tariff in rupees. Solar investments' dollar economic internal rate of return to the Indian economy is in the high teens while the borrowing of debt could be only at 5-6%. The economic surplus from each project is transferred to and aggregated in the larger Indian economy. Hence, the role of the RBI and government is perfectly justified and is crucial in achieving this grand vision.
If developers can avail of the debt in rupee at 5-6% — i.e. at the same interest as that of international dollar denominated debt, they can provide solar power at less than Rs 5/kWh, and that too with no escalation in future. They also don't strain the domestic banks and can raise all the debt abroad.
The government can easily raise about $15-20 billion per annum over the next five years from external sources including NRIs, multilateral agencies, development banks, sovereign wealth funds and lend directly to projects once the PPA is signed up. This will also accelerate development of solar projects since raising debt financing for individual projects can consume a lot of resources.
One must also ensure reliability of cashflows from solar projects. There are substantial credit risks which hound the power sector due to the deteriorating credit profile of the SEBs and the lax enforcement of the renewable purchase obligation (RPO) mechanism. The state government needs to backstop the PPAs with the SEBs and ensure strict compliance of the RPOs.
The Centre should provide a guarantee that if states/SEBs do not pay their solar developer in time, they will step up and take it out of allocation to the states. Only those states that sign up for this programme should be entitled to the foreign exchange risk covered by the central government/RBI and avail of cheap solar power.
The benefits of tapping into our own clean energy source are unmatchable from an energy security viewpoint, climate change mitigation, adoption of future-proof technology and developing quicker power sources, generation of employment accelerating our growth rate. There is little doubt that the government needs to ensure reliable and cost-effective energy supply to ensure making the 'Make in India' programme a resounding success. There are few initiatives so impactful and so easily doable for our country. Solar can be the shale equivalent of India.

In modernising India  suicide is on the rise among youngDec 11, 2014 at 08:50am IST
In modernising India, suicide is on the rise among young
14
0
New Delhi: Pinki Chauhan, a straight-A physics and maths student, arrived at her university campus in India shortly after breakfast, poured petrol over her wispy frame and lit a match.
The 19-year-old ran screaming across the college grounds in Gurgaon, near the capital New Delhi, before falling to her knees in flames outside the principal's office. She died a few days later.
Her brother, Arun, said the incident a couple of months ago came after Pinki had been upset after receiving zero marks in an exam, and had been arguing with teachers for her paper to be re-marked.
Unlike the rest of the world where younger men are more likely to take their lives than women, in India the opposite is the case.
But Pinki's problems ran much deeper. Highly ambitious, she was anxious she wouldn't fulfil her dreams. At the same time she'd been under pressure from some family members to follow a more traditional route to marry and settle down.
"She didn't know what else to do," Arun said. "She put a lot of pressure on herself."
Pinki's story is emblematic of problems confronting India's young, in a society impatient for progress and yet underprepared for the challenges that inevitably accompany modernity.
Cultural issues, discrimination, parental pressure and competition for highly paid jobs are combining to create a suicide epidemic among young Indians. Compounding the problem is a system that barely recognises mental health issues.
India has the world's highest suicide rate among 15 to 29 year olds, ahead of next-placed North Korea, according to a September report by the World Health Organization. For the first time, suicide is the leading cause of death among young Indian women, overtaking deaths during childbirth, the WHO says.
In most parts of the world suicides tend to occur among the most disadvantaged groups, but in India they are happening among better educated young adults living in the most prosperous regions.
In south India, where literacy rates and incomes are highest in the country, suicide rates are 10 times higher than in northern states, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal in 2012.
"Aspirations are at a much higher level and society around them is not always keeping pace, so the disappointment is much greater," said Vikram Patel, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who carried out the research.
Mental health neglect
As India's policymakers strive to put the country on a path to modernity, something akin to China's transformation of the past two decades, the young are feeling the pressure. In particular, young females.
Unlike the rest of the world where younger men are more likely to take their lives than women, in India the opposite is the case. Experts put this down to women's low status in society.
Compounding the issue, little help is at hand for those suffering from mental illness. In India, the condition often goes undiagnosed or untreated, and until a couple of months ago the country did not have national mental health policy. Spending on mental health accounts for 0.06 percent of the government's health budget, the lowest level in the world after Zimbabwe.
For most Indians with mental illnesses "there is literally no care available", Harsh Vardan, then-health minister, said in October announcing plans to build more mental hospitals and train more psychiatrists.
In January, the health ministry launched a nationwide programme to provide community support for adolescents suffering from mental illness.
Trapped
In the run-up to Chauhan's suicide, conflict had been building on different fronts. Exam pressure weighed heavily on her mind. There were disputes with her parents. She felt trapped between the competing ideals of old India and new.
She lived in a village on the edge of Gurgaon where the timeless India of wheat fields and cattle-drawn carts abuts the frantically rising apartment towers of the budding middle class.
Chauhan didn't want to get married as a teenager, the path for most women in her village. In many families, once a woman gets married there is little chance for education and her primary job is to serve her husband's family.
"She had been arguing with her parents, who wanted her to get married, but she was ambitious, she wanted to prove herself and achieve her dreams," said her brother, Arun.
When she scored zero on a physics paper she was crushed, fearing it would blemish her job chances. Chauhan along with other students pleaded with their teachers for the papers to be reassessed.
Her university, Government Girls College, declined comment when contacted by Reuters, saying the case was under police investigation.
A teacher at the college, who asked not to be indentified, said there was a mismatch between student's expectations and what they were capable of. "We find many students get a shock when they come here because they have been doing well in school and then they don't get good marks (here)."
Another teacher said that while the college provided counselling to students, the high student-to-teacher ratio meant some people missed the safety net.
Pinki appeared to fall into that category.
Tragically, the college later said that what had pushed her to fatally strike a match was the result of an error. Pinki had in fact passed the exam, and was one of the best students performing in her class.

India will see 5.9% growth in 2015  6.3% in 2016: ReportIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
India’s economic growth is expected to improve to 6.3 per cent in 2016 with the country leading economic recovery in South Asia, according to a United Nations report.
The UN World Economic Situation and Prospects 2015 (WESP) report, launched here on Wednesday, also said India is likely to make progress in implementing economic policy reforms and help provide support to business and consumer confidence.
It said global economic growth is forecast to continue increasing over the next two years, despite legacies from the financial crisis continuing to weigh on growth, and the emergence of new challenges, including geopolitical conflicts such as in Ukraine, and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
The global economy is expected to grow 3.1 per cent in 2015 and 3.3 per cent in 2016, compared with an estimated growth of 2.6 per cent for 2014, when the pace of expansion has been moderate and uneven.
It said India, which is estimated to record a 5.4 per cent economic growth in 2014, will see GDP growth improving to 5.9 per cent next year and 6.3 per cent in 2016.
Economic growth in South Asia is also set to gradually pick up from an estimated 4.9 per cent in 2014 to 5.4 per cent in 2015 and 5.7 per cent in 2016.
“While the recovery will be led by India, which accounts for about 70 per cent of regional output, other economies such as Bangladesh and Iran are also projected to see stronger growth in the forecast period,” the report said.
The about six per cent growth projected for India in 2016 will be the highest since the 2008-2011 period when it had grown at about 7.3 per cent.
Economic growth had slowed to 4.7 per cent in 2012, according to the UN report.
During 2014, East Asia, including China, managed to register relatively robust growth, while India led South Asia to a moderate strengthening.
Developing countries as a group are expected to grow at 4.8 per cent in 2015 and 5.1 per cent in 2016, up from the 4.3 per cent estimated for 2014.
The report added that along with robust external demand, growth is expected to be underpinned by a moderate strengthening of domestic consumption and investment as countries benefit from improved macroeconomic conditions.
“Several countries, notably India, are likely to make progress in implementing economic policy reforms, thus providing support to business and consumer confidence,” it said.

Delhi cab rape case: Uber s Asia-Pacific head questioned againRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
The Asia-Pacific head of US-based cab service Uber was questioned by the police for the second consecutive day yesterday in connection with the rape of a 27-year-old finance executive by the company’s driver, during which he was asked about details of their safety features, details of drivers among others.
During questioning, which took place for nearly two hours, Eric Alexander, the Uber Asia-Pacific head was handed over a 12 point questionnaire by police which included details of all the taxis and its drivers working with them and how they checked their antecedents and the details of the directors of the company, its security features and background check mechanism.

“Alexander has asked for a week’s time to submit the answers of the questions as some of them had to be sourced from their headquarters in San Francisco,” said DCP (North) Madhur Verma.
The police which had registered an FIR against the company is yet to decide on who faces the liability for the negligence on part of Uber.
The Hong Kong-based executive was also asked whether they had received any prior complaints about Shiv Kumar Yadav, the accused in this case, route of the cab and of the accused on the day of the incident, number of drops Yadav did during his period with the company and the feedback about him from customers.
Alexander had reached the DCP office at Civil Lines in the evening along with the General Manager (Marketing) Gagan Bhatia in the evening.
He was also asked about the India operations of the company and its organizational structure.
Police officials also suggested that an emergency button should be present in the car in case of any emergency.
My deepest sympathies with the victim. We are cooperating with the police and I cannot divulge further details since investigations are underway, Alexander told reporters after the questioning.
He had joined the investigation on Tuesday and had met senior police officials of north district at Civil Lines.
He was issued a notice by police under section 91 CrPC to provide certain documents of the company.
He had also  visited the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) office on Tuesday after being summoned by it.
Delhi Police, which has already filed an FIR against Uber charging it with cheating its customers and defying government orders, has been questioning senior Uber officials for the last three days.
The company was banned from operating in the city by Delhi government on Monday.
Shiv Kumar Yadav, who was driving the uber cab, had allegedly raped the woman on Friday night when the victim, who works for a finance company in Gurgaon, was headed back to her home in north Delhi’s Inderlok area.

SpiceJets $4-billion order for 737 Max aircraft intact: BoeingRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
Despite the recent financial woes that have led SpiceJet to cut down fleet and operations, the airline’s scheduled delivery of 42 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, worth over $4 billion, remains intact with the first aircraft set to be delivered by the end of 2018.
“The order (by SpiceJet) very much holds even though the airline is working towards reducing debt and getting back to healthier finances,” Dinesh A Keskar, Boeing’s vice-president (sales) for Asia Pacific and India, said in a telephonic interview.
“Our track record is very good and not a single Boeing order has so far been canceled. We don’t expect SpiceJet to cancel or reduce their order,” Keskar added.
When asked about the status of the Boeing order, a SpiceJet spokesperson said the airline didn’t want to comment on the issue.
During the last two months or so, billionaire Kalanithi Maran-controlled SpiceJet has gradually reduced its Boeing 737 fleet size to 22 planes, down from the 37 it operated earlier this year. Salaries have been delayed and the airline has faced regulatory scrutiny, following a spate of cancellations aimed at cutting costs. The airline has also failed to get an external investor on board despite trying for the last two years.
Recently, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) barred SpiceJet from accepting bookings for travel more than a month in advance. According to a Bloomberg report, DGCA has also cancelled 183 of the airline’s landing and parking slots. However, Boeing is confident that recovery for SpiceJet is around the corner.
By cutting fleet size SpiceJet has reduced its monthly expenses on fleet lease significantly. It has started deploying its aircraft on most profitable routes, scrapping the loss-making routes, Keskar said. “We are obviously cautiously optimistic on SpiceJet,” he added.
Boeing’s Keskar said that as many as 2,500 orders for Boeing 737 Max aircraft have been placed with the company by various airlines and leasing companies. The first aircraft of this configuration, which is expected to roll out in 2017, will, however, reach SpiceJet only during the final quarter of calendar year 2018.

Brent crude edges up towards $65Brent crude edges up towards $65
Reuters
Tweet
Beijing, Dec 11:  
Brent crude ticked higher on Thursday but remained below $65 per barrel, and not far above five-year lows hit in the previous session, with the market’s bearish tone largely intact.
Comments by the Saudi Arabian oil minister shrugging off an output cut on Wednesday renewed worries about a global glut that has slashed prices by more than 40 per cent since June.
Brent crude edged up 51 cents to $64.75 by 0325 GMT, a little more than a dollar away from the previous session’s low of $63.56 - the weakest since July 2009. The benchmark had closed down almost 4 per cent on Wednesday.
A $40 fall in oil shifts $1.3 trillion, 2% of world output, from oil producers to consumers. Good for China, India, Taiwan says Bloomberg

“This is a bit of a return to a more normal pattern of trading for us in this time zone,’’ Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist for CMC Markets in Sydney, said of the gains in early trading.
“Often we reverse the overnight moves as the shorter-term trading interests take a profitable cut out of their positions.’’
US crude rose 47 cents to $61.41, after sharp losses of almost 5 per cent in the previous session, its biggest daily drop in almost two weeks. It also hit a near 5-1/2 year low, of $60.43, on Wednesday.
Crude inventories
The US benchmark came under pressure as crude inventories in the country rose unexpectedly last week, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.
Crude stocks rose by 1.5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 5, compared with analysts' expectations for a 2.2-million-barrel draw.
Battle for market share
Traders are now eyeing an increasingly competitive battle for market share among OPEC exporters, for clues on when and at what price they would step in to help balance the oil market.
Leading the challenge is Kuwait, which has set the official selling price for its crude sales to Asian buyers for January at $3.95 a barrel below the average of Oman/Dubai quotes, a trader said, the lowest it has been since December 2008.
Global demand for OPEC crude in 2015 is expected to fall to its lowest in more than a decade and far below current output, the group had said on Wednesday, indicating a hefty supply surplus without OPEC output cuts or a slowdown in the US shale boom.

Havells India slumps on revenue forecast cut

Havells India Ltd
(Havells India Ltd falls…)
Havells India Ltd fell 7.48 per cent, adding to its 6.9 per cent slump on Wednesday after company cuts standalone revenue forecast to 12-14 per cent from 17-20 per cent, citing weak domestic demand, according to analysts
Significant pension liabilities was seen at unit Sylvania in due to drop in bond yields, analysts added.
At 11:29 a.m., the stock was trading at Rs 288.55, down 7.10 per cent or Rs 22.05 on the BSE.
Here is what the market expert Ambareesh Baliga says in a chat with ET Now. Excerpts:
ET Now: Havells have said that there are some issues with regard to meeting the sales guidance - they have cut it from 12% to 14% versus the earlier 17% to 20%. They are also talking about the possibility of pension liabilities in the second half which may impact reported profits. What do you make of these two key things and the kind of damage we have seen in the stock already?
Ambareesh Baliga: The issue with stocks like these is that over the last two years, they have actually built up a lot of expectations from analysts as well as investors and when this sort of a news comes in, it comes in as a shocker, because of which you are seeing this cut. This could deepen further because people were not expecting this sort of a news from Havells.
ET Now: What do you think in terms of a price level - how much would the stock get dented by in lieu of this revision in revenue?
Ambareesh Baliga: It is possible that we could see another 10% to 15% cut. This is just the beginning because once this sinks in, you could see a further cut.
ET Now: Do you think the stock would settle at roughly 250 odd in the selling?
Ambareesh Baliga: May not be 250, but possibly closer to about 275 or so. Those who have missed on the way up could actually come and start buying at those lower levels because in this rally - not just across Havells but across various other stocks - people have missed out. Thus, people sitting on the sidelines could actually come in to support at those lower levels.

Cabinet nod for Rs 5 lakh compensation to 1984 riot victims

New Delhi: A proposal to give Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, triggered after assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, has been approved by the government on Wednesday night.
The decision has been taken by the Union Cabinet at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The compensation to the families of the riot victims will be given in addition to what they have so far received from the government and other agencies, official sources said.
A proposal to give Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, has been approved by the government.
Of the 3,325 victims, 2,733 were killed in Delhi alone while rest of the victims were from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states.
The Narendra Modi government had received several petitions from various Sikh organisations in the last three months.
The fresh compensation, which will cost the exchequer Rs 166 crore, sources said.
The anti-Sikhs riots were triggered following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984.
In 2006, the UPA government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had announced a package of Rs 717 crore which included monetary compensation of Rs 3.5 lakh to the kin of each killed in the riots besides financial assistance to the injured and those who had lost their property.
Out of this only, Rs 517 crore had been spent and the remaining Rs 200 crore could not be distributed because of dispute over claimants.
The most affected regions were the Sikh neighbourhoods in Delhi.
Some of the anti-Sikh riot cases are still continuing in courts and many Sikh organisations have alleged that the key conspirators of the violence were at large and victims have not yet got justice.
In 2005, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had apologised for the 1984 anti-Sikh violence saying Gandhi's assassination was a "great national tragedy" and what happened subsequently was "equally shameful".
"I have no hesitation in apologising to the Sikh community. I apologise not only to the Sikh community, but to the whole Indian nation because what took place in 1984 is the negation of the concept of nationhood enshrined in our Constitution," he had said.
During an interview, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had admitted that some Congress members were probably involved in the 1984 riots, in which innocent people had died.

(Some 3,000 jobs -- about…)
NEW YORK: US online retail giant eBay may slash thousands of jobs early next year as it prepares to separate from PayPal to become an independent company, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
Some 3,000 jobs -- about 10 percent of the total workforce -- could be affected, sources close to the company told the newspaper.
The cuts may be in the marketplace division, which includes eBay.com and StubHub , according to WSJ.
An eBay spokeswoman did not confirm or deny the news, and instead said the company is focused on ensuring the success of the new business once the split is complete.
"We are focused on running the business and setting eBay and PayPal up for success as independent companies," Amanda Miller told AFP.
eBay announced in September it was spinning off PayPal in a bid to help the unit compete better in the fast-moving online payments segment.
The plan will take effect next year, and comes after months of pressure led by activist investor Carl Icahn , who had assailed eBay for poor management and claimed that keeping eBay tied with PayPal depressed the value of both.

Sugar companies rally over 11% as government fixes higher ethanol priceSugar companies rally as government fixes higher ethanol price

(Shares of sugar companies…)
MUMBAI: Shares of sugar companies surged in early trade after the government fixed a price of Rs 48.50-49.50 per litre for procurement of ethanol for blending with petrol.
The rate is much higher than the price oil companies presently pay to buy the sugarcane extract.
Oil firms presently pay about Rs 29/litre for ethanol. The Food Ministry had said that ex-sugar mill price of ethanol is around Rs 42.02 per litre. For ethanol suppliers, the landed cost of ethanol at the OMCs depots would be around Rs 49 per litre.
According to Narendra Murkumbi, MD, Shree Renuka Sugars, this will lead to additional demand for 1.25 million litres of ethanol.
In an interview to ET Now, he said the ethanol price has been de-linked from price of petrol for the first time and has been linked to cane pricing.
New pricing will make it easier for mills to convert sugar to ethanol and the industry will have flexibility to move between sugar & ethanol production.
He expects new tender to be launched immediately.
The Cabinet Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) today fixed the delivered price of Ethanol in the range of Rs 48.50 per litre to Rs 49.50 per litre, depending upon the distance of sugar mill from the depot/installation of the public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs), an official statement said.
At 10:00 a.m.; Bajaj Hindusthan was at Rs 22.40, up 6.67 per cent, on the BSE. It surged 11.42 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 23.40.

The UN has sought India's support on climate change as the international community enters the final year of negotiations for securing a meaningful and universal agreement on the pressing global issue in Paris next year.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has asked India for its support on climate change following his meeting with Prakash Javadekar, India's Minister of Environment, Forests and Climate Chang, in Lima yesterday.
The UN Chief commended India for the active engagement on the issue of climate change, particularly its plan for a major increase in solar power, a readout of the Secretary-General's meeting with Javadekar issued by his spokesperson here said.
He asked for the country's strong support as "we enter the final year of negotiations to secure a meaningful, universal agreement in Paris in 2015," the readout said.
Ahead of the UN climate talks in the Peruvian capital, Ban had said he would like India to spell out its nationally determined commitment on reducing emissions by June next year, saying a continued "key and constructive" role played by India will make a universal climate agreement possible in Paris.
Addressing the climate conference, Javadekar said the new post-2020 agreement should ensure a balance between mitigation and adaptation and stressed the urgent need for adaptation to be fully reflected in the new agreement.
"Developing countries will not get the carbon space to achieve sustainable development unless there is more ambitious commitments from developed countries in the pre-2020 era," he said.
"If we believe that the global warming threat is real, then we must deliver on the agreed commitments as a matter of priority," he said, adding that developed countries must scale up their mitigation ambition now and urgently fulfil their promises for providing financial and technological support to developing countries.

Nifty fall not a worry  may rise 30-40% in 24 mths: StanC08:00 am
The Indian market is almost 1 percent lower today with the key benchmark indices losing heavily led by global cues. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Dhiraj Agarwal, Director - Institutional Sales, Standard Chartered Securities says the current market fall is not a worry and does not see a major correction in the market anytime soon.
According to him, the market is unlikely to correct more than 5-6 percent by December-end. He, however, expects Nifty to gain about 30-40 percent in the next 24 months.
Going ahead, Agarwal believes one has to take a positive call on the economy which is currently in doldrums at the ground level. He believes government is doing its best to resolve the coal supply issue.  He is bullish on economic sensitive and cyclical stocks as government’s decisions will have positive impact in the long-term though in short-term growth may remain subdued.
Agarwal expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth to rise by 6-7 percent by next year from the current 5 percent range.
Below is verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: What is your take on the amount of correction we can see? Are we going to see a fairly deep correction, are you getting some negative cues from the global markets?
A: There is certainly some level of increased volatility in the global markets both from the West and China last few days, which is causing a bit of choppiness here as well. But we have gotten so used to low volatility in India that a 300 point cut from the high sounds large, which is just 3.5-4 percent.
I don’t think it is unusual, I don’t think it is large yet, I don’t think something like this has not happened many times in this rally. In fact, this rally has got unusual characteristic of not having a double digit correction right from last August to last September.
Between 13 and 14 months, we haven’t seen a double digit correction which has never happened in the history of markets not even in 2003-2007 Bull Run.
Q: It is precisely this confidence from a lot of experts that makes you a bit nervous, just when the market is starting to get complacent, do you think we could be headed for a major fall towards the end of the year?
A: I doubt if we will get a major fall. It is difficult to say whether I can go slightly more deeper, difficult to roll out. But if you define major as more than 10 percent, I don’t think you will get it. If you define 5-6 percent as major, 3-3.5 percent has already happened, another two percent can happen, tough to say.
Q: Currently, what kind of returns are you expecting from this market in six months, in 12 months, in 24 months?
A: It is easier to see in 24 months, six months is a lot tougher. In 24 months I will go to the extent of saying market could be 30-40 percent higher as compared to the current level.
Next six months can be fairly challenging, it could be chopping up and down, there will be tonnes and tonnes of events packed up in the next six months.
We will have the Union Budget, we will have the speculation around whether Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cuts rate or not or delay it once more, what will US do to the interest rates, many people think they will advance the calendar for the hike to end of Q1, beginning Q2 and so, the first half of next year can be a little choppy. In longer-term it is easier to say and I have bullish longer-term view.
Q: To brace yourself and to prepare yourself for this 30-40 percent run in the next 12-24 months, what kind of stocks or sectors would you lap up on now?
A: You have to be taking a positive call on the economy. So from the next 24 months point of view, given everything the government is doing, either sorting out the coal supply issue or going in for faster execution, faster implementation, faster approvals, all of those things will unlock some of the latent suppressed GDP growth at this point.
I think that should be enough to take GDP growth to 6-7 percent range, which means a lot of pressure which has been there on sectors and stocks because of declining economic growth tends to reverse slightly. So it will be largely economy sensitives and cyclicals from 24 months point of view.
Q: There are metal majors who tell us that nothing has moved on the mining space and even where the Supreme Court has allowed iron ore mining, they have not received any positive response from the state governments in particular. Also, power companies are not sounding any more optimistic, they are deeply worried about the finances of the distribution companies (DISCOMs) after the first round of price hikes, tariff hikes have not been announced by the DISCOMs. Their ability to buy power even assuming coal was available and power is being generated is extremely questionable. The despondency among the smokestack companies, infrastructure, metals, industrials is not funny, are you confident of growth?
A: It is always darkest before dawn. The on the ground feedback is that the economy has not recovered at all, things have not started moving infact, if at all, many people think that things are little tougher today than they were six months ago. But a lot of things are happening - on the mining front for example, the new changes proposed by the government on the mining act that could free up a lot of the bottlenecks that you just mentioned.
Similarly, a lot of movement which is happening, the government is trying to do behind the scenes on coal should ease out the issue on power.
All these statements which the power minister and the new railway minister has come up with on how they want to promote investment in the sector and free up and get more private participation, all this will happen but none of these happens overnight, these things take time which is another possible factor to say that next six months could be a bit tough and challenging but in the longer-term, work is happening but there is always a pipeline effect.
If you take the example of the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, 1999 to 2004, the good work started in 1999, the real benefit of the impact on the economy started getting visible only in 2002 to 2003 and so, it takes time.
Q: We have seen a fall of 45 percent in Brent crude since the start of the year, would you increase your exposure to either paint companies or oil marketing companies (OMCs) or tyre companies in order to play this move?
A: I think the stocks have already done very well. Purely from the short-term point of view, the risk is that the crude bounces from here and tanks further. Purely a short-term tactical view here, I would be wary and will look out for a bounce in crude at this point of time rather than a further crash.
Q: This seminal fall in crude and other commodities has diminished the buying power of a whole range of countries, smaller ones like Venezuela and Nigeria and bigger ones like Brazil, Russia and other commodity countries, are you working down the earnings of several companies so much so that your overall earnings growth also falls at all in the next couple of quarters?
A: I don’t think India is exposed so much to buying power from oil producing nations that our earnings growth will get impacted significantly. What could be a bigger issue for the market going forward is that some of these countries specially Middle East have been suppliers of capital to the country.
If the situation persists for a very long period of time, attracting capital from these destinations might be a bit of a challenge but I don’t think from earnings growth point it matters much.

There should be a further fall in  Havells India because the expectations were very high, had moved up extremely well in the last 1.5-2 years. So, possibly we could have a further fall. I think it fell about 7-8 percent yesterday. We could have possibly another 5-7 percent fall further in a day or two.

We have already seen a decent move in some of the stocks, like  Reliance Capital can still be bought for a further move.  Exide Industries is another one which has that insurance play, so it is very much possible that because of this we could see a further move in Exide. However, that would be limited to another Rs 5-8 from here. So, I see a maximum upside of Rs 183-185 for that stock.
Sugar stocks
I think the whole sugar pack could be a dark horse because the industry is in the ICU and unless the government does something for them you will have most of these mills closing down in the next 1.5-2 years and we really can’t do without sugar; Indians can’t do without sugar. So, clearly the government has to do something about it and this is just the beginning. Ethanol blending surely is positive for them and at the same time in case they announce some set of import duty increase possibly some export incentives, I think this could be a beginning of big move for the sugar going ahead. So, at the current juncture,  Bajaj Hindustan is the best bet in this followed by  Balrampur Chini and Shree Renuka Sugar . 
However, at the same time, the move in  Praj Industries could only be a sentimental move because already the capacity has been built up in India for nearly 10 percent blending and we are yet to reach about 5 percent. So, I don’t think this will be incrementally positive for Praj but you will have surely a sentimental move.

Mozambique gas may not make it to IndiaMozambique gas may not come to India
Kalpana Pathak | Mumbai Dec 12, 2014 12:30 AM IST
Much-awaited gas from Mozambique’s Rovuma basin may not make it to Indian shores. Bharat Petro Resources Limited (BPRL), the upstream arm of the state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation, and its consortium partners have tied up two-thirds of the gas with customers in Asia. But so far, no Indian company, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) executives said, had come on board to secure gas supplies from the consortium.
This September, at BPCL’s annual general meeting, S Varadarajan, the company’s chairman and managing director, had said, “Members of the consortium have tied up two-thirds of the gas with customers in Japan, China and Thailand, and are in talks with Indian companies, too.” BPRL and its consortium partners have been in discussions for marketing natural gas from their flagship international asset, the Rovuma basin in Mozambique.
“The operator had in 2012 formed marketing teams to talk to companies in Japan, China and Thailand. These countries are ready to pay more for gas. Besides, we need to maximise our revenue as we plan to set up two LNG (liquefied natural gas) trains,” said a senior BPRL executive. BPCL did not reply to an email questionnaire.  Natural gas reserves in the Mozambique block have been estimated at 50-70 trillion cubic feet (tcf) by its operator Anadarko. This is almost 10 times the reserves of Reliance Industries’ D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin.
BPRL partners the Mozambique block with consortium members Anadarko Mocambique Area 1 Limitada (26.5 per cent), BPRL Ventures Mozambique (10 per cent), Beas Rovuma Energy Mozambique (10 per cent), ONGC Videsh Ltd (10 per cent), Cove Energy Mozambique Rovuma Offshore (8.5 per cent), Mitsui E&P Mozambique Area 1 Ltd (20 per cent) and Empressa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos EP (15 per cent). The consortium plans to set up two LNG trains of five million tonnes each with a provision for expansion in the future. The consortium will have to enter into long-term contracts with buyers to raise funds to finance the project and help put up the first two trains. Production from the fields will begin in 2019.
The LNG trains will initially require around $18-20 billion, of which $14 billion will be raised in loans.
“The rest will be brought in by the consortium members. Further investments will be from revenue the project brings in,” the executive added.
BPRL plans to invest Rs 12,000 crore in energy exploration and production in Mozambique and Brazil over the next four years.
BPCL’s share of reserves is five to seven tcf, equivalent to the size of the D6 block in India. BPRL will be investing up to Rs 10,000 crore as part of its share towards a 10 million tonne LNG terminal project in Mozambique.
BPRL had, in September, said it had been trying to put in place a mechanism through which BPCL’s balance sheet can be relieved. Based on the discoveries, the company has SBLC (standby letter of credit) range of $2 billion and with that, it has taken foreign currency loans of $900-950 million for the Mozambique asset.
BPRL plans to invest Rs 12,000 crore in energy exploration and production in Mozambique and Brazil over the next four years — its biggest investment in the so-called upstream sector.
“As far as upstream is concerned, we have spent about $1.3 billion. Of this, $680 million has gone into exploration in the Brazil block and $480 million for operations in Mozambique,” said D Raj Kumar, adding that "We are talking to the Mozambique government to see that we have a stable legal, fiscal and contractual regime in place. This stability will mean the operations will be insulated from any change in taxes, rules or regulations."
“These two assets (Brazil and Mozambique) are where the major chunk of investments are planned in the coming few years,”  Rajkumar had said in September after BPCL's annual general meeting. BPRL is present in seven countries, including India.
BPRL owns a 20 per cent stake in the Brazil block through an equal joint venture with Videocon Industries. Petrobras SA, the national oil company of Brazil, is the operator of the block and holds the remaining 60 per cent.

Lankan navy detains 27 Tamil Nadu fishermen; releases them after warningLankan navy detains 27 Tamil Nadu fishermen; releases them after warning
Press Trust of India | Rameswaram Dec 11, 2014 10:15 AM IST
Sri Lankan navy detained 27 fishermen from Tamil Nadu overnight, accusing them of poaching in the island nation's waters, and released them this morning with a warning.
While 13 fishermen from Jagadapattinam in Thanjavur district were detained along with three boats, 14 fishermen from here were held with their three boats when they were fishing in the mid-sea late last night.
The Lankan navy personnel also damaged their fishing nets, Assistant Director of Fisheries Department Sekar said.
The fishermen, who were taken to Kankesanthurai naval base, were released today morning after a warning not to fish in the Sri Lankan waters, Sekhar said.
Fishermen from Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Karaikal, Thanjavur and Pudukottai had decided to boycott fishing indefinitely from today in protest against the incident.

Sensex below 28K  Nifty loses 8400-level on global sell-offComments
Persistent selling pressure due to a sell-off in China and weak cues in other global markets dragged down benchmark Sensex today by 322.39 points to over one-month closing low of 27,797.01.
The NSE barometer Nifty also tanked 97.55 points to end below 8,400-mark at 8,340.70 amid investors booking profits for the third straight session. Shares of power, metal, capital goods, consumer durables, refinery, banking and auto sectors were among the major losers.
The overall market breadth was very weak as about 900 stocks rose while over 2,000 scrips fell.
Rising gold imports widened current account deficit to $ 10.1 billion or 2.1 per cent of GDP in July-September quarter of this fiscal, up from 1.2 % a year-ago, but experts are hopeful that it will remain in comfortable zone to be financed by growing capital inflows.
The BSE Sensex resumed higher at 28,134.22 and firmed up further to 28,157.53 on initial strong demand in view of good foreign capital inflows.
However, it declined afterwards to 27,763.82 before ending at over one-month low of 27,797.01, showing a sharp fall of 322.39 points or 1.15 % on fag-end selling. It has now lost 765.81 points, or 2.68 %, in last 3 days.
"Pressurized by weak global cues mainly from China, the domestic bourses slid further down and lost more than a percent in the end. On the macro-front, India's CAD widened for the second quarter of the current financial year, added to selling pressure. Profit taking was widespread," said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities.
The NSE 50-share Nifty also moved down further by 97.55 points or 1.16 % to 8,340.70.
Chinese stocks led decline as Shanghai Composite index dropped by 5.43 % in Asian markets today after China's securities clearing house yesterday tightened use of corporate bonds as collateral for short-term financing.
European stocks were also trading lower after the latest data showed Germany's exports declined at the start of the fourth quarter in adjusted terms. Key indices in France, UK and Germany fell by 0.69 % to 1.05 %.

US stocks mixed as European  Asian markets sinkUS stocks mixed as European, Asian markets sink
AP Dec 10, 2014, 03.26AM IST
(Tuesday's decline in Chinese…)
NEW YORK: The US stock market ended slightly lower Tuesday, avoiding the sharp declines in Europe and Asia thanks to a rally in beaten-down energy companies.
After an early sell-off, the Dow Jones industrial average steadied and ended with a moderate loss of 0.3 percent. That followed a sharp drop in European indexes, most notably in Greece, where the stock market suffered its biggest one-day loss since 1987. Greek officials called an early presidential vote, and investors feared the outcome could jeopardize the country's bailout program.
Stocks in China also stumbled, interrupting a months-long surge, after regulators there tightened rules for lending.
At the end of the day, the Dow lost 51.28 points to close at 17,801.20. It was down as much as 222 points in early trading. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed effectively unchanged on the day, down 0.49 of a point to 2,059.82. The Nasdaq composite added 25.77 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,766.47.
Energy companies were among the best performers, helped by a rebound in oil prices from a five-year low. Six out of the 10 biggest advancers in the S&P 500 were oil and gas exploration companies.
The gains in the energy industry were a respite for a sector that has been hit hard this year. The S&P 500 energy index is down 12 percent in 2014, versus the 11 percent rise in the overall market.
Telecom companies were among the biggest decliners Tuesday.
Verizon fell $1.98, or 4 percent, to $46.92 after the company said its wireless division's recent practice of deep discounting and buying out competitors' contracts could hurt the company's profit margins. AT&T, another major wireless carrier, also dropped. AT&T fell 99 cents, or 3 percent, to $32.89.
While the losses in the U.S. were slight, the losses in Europe were far deeper. France's CAC-40 closed down 2.6 percent and Germany's DAX lost 2.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 shed 2.1 percent.
The Athens stock exchange plunged 13 percent as investors worried that the country might have to hold early general elections and that a left-wing opposition party would win. The Syriza party wants to cut what Greece owes in bailout money, which could spook investors for years and potentially derail the country's recovery.
``It's somewhat of a gamble the prime minister is playing,'' said Phil Camporeale, a portfolio manager for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ``While there isn't the contagion issue there was in Europe two years ago, it's still not good for the eurozone.''
Major Chinese oil and bank stocks fell, some by the daily limit of 10 percent allowed by regulators, after China's clearing house for securities trades raised the minimum rating for corporate bonds it would accept in exchange for short-term credit. That prompted concerns about the availability of financing for trades.
Tuesday's decline in Chinese stocks interrupted a buying frenzy that has pushed the Shanghai benchmark up 41 percent since June.
Hu Guopeng, an analyst at Founder Securities in Beijing, said the plunge in China was a ``technical correction'' linked to the uncertainty about the availability of credit.
It ``does not mean the end of the market boom,'' Hu said.
U.S. government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.21 percent from 2.26 percent late Monday. The dollar declined 1.2 percent against the Japanese currency to 119.64 yen. The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.238.
The price of oil rose Tuesday as the value of the dollar fell. Because oil is priced in dollars, a weaker dollar makes oil more attractive to global investors. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 77 cents to close at $63.82 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, rose 65 cents to close at $66.84 on the ICE Futures exchange in London.

Greek stocks plummet on fear of political crisisGreek stocks plummet on fear of political crisis
By AP | 10 Dec, 2014, 02.20AM IST
Syriza's Tsipras said the final presidential vote, on Dec. 29, would signify the end of the governing coalition's ``catastrophic'' austerity policie
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
ATHENS: The Greek stock market had its biggest plunge since 1987 Tuesday as concerns mounted that the country is heading for a political crisis that could jeopardize its financial rescue program.
The benchmark stock index in Athens dropped 12.8 percent after the conservative-led government brought forward the date of a presidential vote.
If the vote in Greece's parliament is inconclusive, investors fear it could lead to general elections and a possible victory for an opposition party that wants to modify the bailout.
Investors also dumped Greek government bonds as they became more wary of the country's ability to repay its debt.
The main left-wing opposition party, Syriza, which is leading in the polls, has said it will demand a substantial cut to what Greece owes in rescue loans if it is elected.
Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management , said that the country's main creditors, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, are not likely to go along with that. Greene said Syriza's leader, Alexis Tsipras, would probably end up falling in line.
``The downside to that is that I think half his party will rebel as a result,'' said Greene. That could lead to further political chaos and possibly another election, leaving the economy rudderless.
Greek government bonds took a hit Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year bond jumped 0.84 percentage point to 7.98 percent as investors demanded to be paid more to loan money to Greece.
Theodore Krintas, managing director of Attica Wealth Management, said that international investors, who account for up to 70 percent of daily transactions in the Greek market, opted to ``just sell and get out.''
``I think this explains the magnitude, the extent that we see the losses of the Athens stock exchange today,'' Krintas said.
Although Syriza has softened its rhetoric in the past, it hasn't clarified whether it would resort to a default on the rescue loans. While that would lighten Greece's debt burden, it could have other severe repercussions. It might, for example, spook international investors away from lending money to the country for years, hurting its ability to get back on its feet. Some suggested it could cause the country to fall out of the euro union.
Greece's president is a figurehead with minimal political clout. But the election requires a super-majority that would include backing by some lawmakers from the overall hostile opposition, which appears beyond the reach of the struggling governing coalition. If three successive votes, from Dec. 17-29, prove fruitless, general elections must be called by early February, nearly a year and a half ahead of schedule.
In a televised address Tuesday, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras nominated Stavros Dimas , a senior figure in his conservative party and former EU commissioner for the environment, as the government's presidential candidate.
Opposition parties said they would not back him, or any candidate the government puts forth, to force national elections.
Syriza's Tsipras said the final presidential vote, on Dec. 29, would signify the end of the governing coalition's ``catastrophic'' austerity policies.
``At last, this year we will have every reason to wish a Happy New Year,'' he said.
The bulk of Greece's 240 billion euros ($294 billion) in loans, those from the EU, run out this year. The last batch has still not been paid, however, as Greece and the EU disagree on whether Athens should impose more austerity cuts to qualify.
European finance ministers on Monday gave Greece a two-month extension on the bailout so they can complete the talks. Just after that, the Greek government said it was bringing forward the date of the presidential vote by about two months to strengthen its negotiating position and avoid protracted uncertainty.
Analyst Holger Schmieding at Berenberg Bank said that since the financial crisis, the eurozone is much better equipped to handle a Greek ``accident.'' It has a bailout fund and the European Central Bank has committed to buy the bonds of troubled countries, if needed. That could help keep the trouble in Greece from hurting confidence in other countries.
Schmieding argued that nobody knows what Syriza would do in power. ``Would they really implement their wild proposals and go down in history as the party that killed the incipient recovery and crashed Greece out of the euro?'' he said. ``That uncertainty would weigh heavily on markets.''

Russia & India have huge potential of bilateral tradeBeijing
(I am convinced that we will…)
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been to India several times over, is probably on his most critical trip to Delhi amid fast changing geo-political scenario. Amid growing Western sanctions Moscow is aligned with Beijing like never before and much to dismay in Delhi has entered into a military partnership with Pakistan. Other the hand India and USA are hoping to realize full potential of their partnership. However, India's refusal to be party to Western sanctions will be music to Putin's ears. In an interview with ET's Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury, the Russian President pointed out that PM Modi is personally committed to promote bilateral ties and announced that Moscow will sign a new agreement with Delhi for setting up 24 nuclear reactors besides inviting India for hydrocarbon investments in Siberian and Artic regions.
You have met Prime Minister Modi a few times now. What is your personal opinion of him? How is interacting with him different from his predecessors?
As the President of the Russian Federation, I have been to India five times. I particularly remember my visit in October 2000, when we signed the historic Declaration on Strategic Partnership with the Indian partners.
With regard to my contacts with Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi, that is true, we became acquainted on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit in Brazil this July. We also had meaningful conversations in Brisbane (Australia) in November at the meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the BRICS countries and during the G20 summit.
I note with satisfaction the commitment of the Indian leadership to searching for new promising areas of cooperation. I am convinced that the common aspiration to further develop our bilateral relations will help to achieve significant results at the upcoming Indian-Russian Summit.
I am convinced that we will continue this fruitful work together with the new government in order to expand our multifaceted and mutually beneficial contacts, especially given the fact that as far back as he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat state Mr. Narendra Modi visited several times the Astrakhan Region, which has since established fraternal relations with that Indian state. Thus, today, we are happy to see friendly India to be led by a reputable political leader, who has already made a significant personal contribution to the promotion of the Russian-Indian cooperation.
We look forward to discussing specific steps aimed at strengthening the privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India. We will devote particular attention to expanding trade and economic links and boosting mutual investments. Serious preparatory work has been done during the past sessions of the Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation and the Indo-Russian Forum on Trade and Investment (New Delhi, November 5, 2014). Joint strategic projects include the construction of new units for Indian nuclear power plants, promotion of Russian Sukhoi Superjet-100 and MS-21 aircraft to the Indian market, introduction of the GLONASS system in the sectors of the Indian economy. Our priorities include building a butyl rubber plant, helicopter manufacturing, creating "a smart city" on the basis of Russian technologies, organizing assembly of industrial tractors.
India gets serious about domestic defence production, allowing foreign investment and encouraging private Indian companies, Russia would seem to be behind the US and Israel in terms of future joint ventures and big ticket deals. Can Indo-Russian defence ties ever get back their past strength?
We attach particular importance to the development of military and technical cooperation that is one of the main components of our strategic partnership. We will discuss in detail the current projects in this most important sphere related not only to the export of ready-made equipment but to close technological and industrial cooperation as well.We already have examples of such effective cooperation, by which I mean the production of high-precision up-to-date BrahMos missiles and creation of a multifunctional fifth-generation fighter aircraft.
 
India has traditionally regarded Russia, and the USSR in the past, as a reliable "friend for all times." Many in New Delhi interpreted Russia's cancellation of naval drills and its emphasis on relationship with Pakistan as a deliberate counter to India. Does this tit for tat diplomacy work? Will Moscow really gain by aligning with an always-unstable Islamabad vis a vis South Asia's major economic and political power, India?
Our countries have been maintaining military and technical cooperation for many decades. Moreover, I would like to emphasize that India is a reliable and time-tested partner.

Vladimir Putin s visit will boost diamond trade: GJEPCAlrosa
(GJEPC has expressed the…)
NEW DELHI: Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) has expressed the hope that Russian President Vladimir Putin's forthcoming visit to India will boost the diamond sector in both the countries.
Putin's two-day India visit starts tomorrow. "India, which is the major diamond polishing hub, and Russia, which is poised to spend significantly in diamond exploration in the future, are natural diamond partners and expected to gain enormously with the direct partnership proposed by the industry.
"The visit of President Putin to India during the World Diamond Conference is of great significance and we are hopeful that (Indian) government accepts our proposals for direct sourcing and a special notified zone in India," GJEPC Chairman Vipul Shah said in a statement.
Setting up of these zones would help attract global diamond firms to open offices in Mumbai, a major diamond trading hub of the country, besides Surat.
The body wants direct selling of rough diamonds from Russian mines to India.
GJEPC in association with the World Diamond Mark Foundation and with the support from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is organising the World Diamond Conference here during December 11-12.
Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected to attend the inaugural function.
Russia is the world's top producer of rough diamonds. But the direct selling of rough diamonds from Russian mines to India is less. Most of the diamonds comes through diamond hubs such as Antwerp and Dubai.
GJEPC also said that for the first time ever India will witness a convocation attended by global heads of mines, luxury brands and global diamond organisations such as World Diamond Mark Foundation, De Beers , Alrosa , World Federation of Diamond Bourses, Rio Tinto, Antwerp Diamond Bank, International Diamond Manufacturers Association and World Diamond Council .
It said the MoU on direct sourcing of rough' between Alorsa and India is expected to be signed during the conference.It will give an edge to Russia over other countries such as Dubai and Antwerp, it added.
The bilateral trade between Russia and India stands at $10 billion. According to reports, Russia exports USD 4 billion worth of rough diamonds, but currently only about USD 800 million of them go directly to India.

Putin visit could help sort out glitches in India-Russia defence tiesRussian president Vladimir Putin's visit here on December 10 is expected to ease some heartburn between the two staunch allies.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Russia remains extremely miffed with India for selecting French Rafale fighters and American Apache attack helicopters over its products but maintains that its recently inked military cooperation pact with Pakistan will not be "detrimental" to Indian security interests.
India, of course, is angry with Russia's move to lift an informal arms embargo and directly supply Mi-35 attack helicopters to Pakistan. "Russia is obviously getting back at us for increasingly turning to the US, France, Israel and others for weapon supplies.But we cannot put all our eggs in one basket," a defence official said.
Russian president Vladimir Putin's visit here on December 10 is expected to ease some heartburn between the two staunch allies.
Russian ambassador Alexander M Kadakin told reporters on Monday that the agreement with Pakistan did not envisage arms transfers to Islamabad in the immediate future. Dubbing India as his country's "closest friend and strategic partner", he said Moscow's growing relationship with Islamabad will not be at New Delhi's expense.
But the irritants are there for all to see. Russia, for instance, says Indian MiG fighters will only stop crashing when India stops buying "counterfeit (spare) parts" from Israel, Bulgaria and others. Even before IAF has completed its court of inquiry into the Sukhoi-30MKI's crash near Pune on October 14, Russia has blamed "pilot error" for it.
IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha had initially stated that "automatic firing of ejection seats" could have led to the mishap. On Monday , an IAF officer said, "All technical issues to do with the seat ejection are still under examination."
Kadakin had earlier questioned India's decision to go in for French jets for the yet-to-be-inked $20 billion MMRCA (medium multi-role combat aircraft) project, holding the Rafales could be "swatted like mosquitoes on an August night" by the Russian-origin Sukhoi-27s being inducted by China. On Monday , he compared the Rafales to "beautifullyclad lady dragonflies" that can easily be squashed by Russian fighters.
Amid all this wrangling, both India and Russia are keen to seal the fifth-generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) project, the biggest ever defence programme between the two.

India Inc worried about Modi govt s  lack of boldnessInitial euphoria wanes, India Inc worried about Modi government's 'lack of boldness'

(At a closed door CII meeting,…)
NEW DELHI: Six months after Modi Sarkar assumed power amidst great expectations, many industrialists are concerned about what they see as a lack of boldness in reforms and an absence of radical ideas. As a result, they are largely unwilling to commit fresh investments in the country at a time the infrastructure sector is in a virtual logjam because of high debt.
At a closed door, barred-to-media session of the Confederation of Indian Industry last Saturday, December 6, some of India Inc's most prominent voices asked whether the government is doing enough to jumpstart growth, unlock infrastructure and spur fresh investments. While business leaders conceded the mood was upbeat, they said a lot more needed to be done for fresh investments to kick in.
"This government has moved us from despair to hope... but now I think that hope is waning," said GVK Power & Infrastructure Vice-Chairman Sanjay Reddy, according to people present at the meeting. "The government actually needs to take a bold line and has to say we are going to move away from the past. But we are not seeing that happening at the moment," added SRF Chairman Arun Bharat Ram, referring to labour reforms and the role of the public sector. "One of the biggest opponents to labour reforms is BJP's own trade union and if what we are going to see is every move being weighed politically, we are in the same boat as before," he added.
Arun Bharat Ram's office told ET he wasn't present at the CII meeting, but two attendees confirmed to ET that he was indeed there and had voiced his opinion. GVK also denied that Reddy had made any such comments at the meeting. Biocon founder and Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw expressed concern over the BJP government following in the footsteps of its predecessor by floating new welfare schemes in healthcare.
"I am personally very concerned about the government's focus on a universal healthcare programme. As we all know, it should be a sustainable model, it cannot be an overarching free-for-all scheme... there should be some co-pay. Social welfare schemes shouldn't be about doling out freebies and creating an entitlement culture that is detrimental to growth. The government is very pro-growth, but within that, we need to be very sensitive and conscious of the social welfare area," said Shaw, who attended the meeting. She told ET later that "a lot of industry members (at the meeting) talked about how much reforms this government can actually bring in". Shaw also confirmed her comments at the meeting. "What we are seeing right now is reforms that are minor tinkering. There is a lot of interest in Indian stocks, but where is the investment in new projects? Everyone is playing wait and watch," she added.
Columbia University Professor Arvind Panagariya, who is an advisor to Rajasthan's BJP government, is learnt to have said that things which should have happened by now, such as new norms for land acquisition, removing tax uncertainty and recapitalisation of banks, haven't taken place. "India is a little behind on the growth curve... and I am slightly disappointed," he said. Panagariya did not respond to ET's email.
  Veteran industrialist Dhruv Sawhney, chairman of the Triveni Group, said the capital goods sector, in the first six months, is still at 60 per cent of where it was in 2011. "This feedback should be given. This sector hasn't taken off even till end of November. It's quite widespread. That shows the actual investment on the ground is not happening," Sawhney is learnt to have said. Sawhney's office said he was out of the country and was unavailable for comment.
Janmejaya Sinha, chairman of The Boston Consulting Group's Asia Pacific unit, expressed concern over the state of the PSU banking sector and suggested the government could consider lowering its stake to 33 per cent. "Credit is not picking up, we cannot get out of this bind," he is learnt to have said. People familiar with the situation told ET that CII President Ajay Shriram started the discussion by inviting participants to air their views in an open and frank manner. Shriram said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was keen to assess "the pulse and the buzz" in industry circles.
Bharti Group Chairman Sunil Mittal praised the efforts of the new government to turn around the economy and urged fellow CEOs to be patient. "Industry should be patient as reforms would take a few years," Mittal is learnt to have said, adding that the new government was a "welcome change in terms of its approach to industry... and that it has the gumption to say we will go for growth and amend laws".

Not the right time to judge Modi govt: Gunit ChadhaASEAN
(India has always had a 'Look…)
From his perch in Singapore, former India CEO of Deutsche Bank Gunit Chadha who is now Asia Pacific co-CEO and is on the Global Group Executive Committee of Deutsche Bank AG, knows the global pulse better than anyone else. In an interview with Anita Bhoir and MC Govardhana Rangan, Chadha says the Indian story is gathering momentum. Edited excerpts.
You moved from India to an Asia-Pacific role more than two years ago. What is the change?
It's been a wonderful two-and-a-half years, with a couple of striking contrasts in the new role. One half of the new role is global, as member, Global Group Executive Committee, Deutsche Bank AG. This was challenging, with cross-winds of deep transformation across the global banking industry, gigantic changes in the regulatory landscape and significant re-alignment of resources and culture to the new business models of global banks. So, the globality of my role was a big change, enriching, exciting and with a steep learning curve.
How about the regional role of actively managing many geographies?
As for my regional role as Co-CEO across 16 countries in Asia-Pacific, the contrasts were less so. Like India, Asia is a high growth region, with size and scale. On the client side, the Indian entrepreneurs have lots in common and yet much to mutually gain from the tycoons in Indonesia and China; the Indian public sector undertakings from the SOEs in Singapore and Indian capital and pension markets from those in Australia.
One contrast was how less India was integrated into the East. India has always had a 'Look West' bias. The East is, however, highly integrated, the corridors from Japan to Greater China to Asean to Australia. India is not as well integrated into those markets. Asia has been an engine of growth post-2008.
With it slowing now, what lies ahead?
There has been a loss of momentum in global growth over the past few quarters. We stay bullish on US growth at 3.5 per cent in 2015, driven by growth in manufacturing, retail consumption and lower fiscal drag. The challenge for Europe is around low growth and structural reforms needed in the core markets. But we don't believe that Europe will get into a crisis mode of sustained deflation or recession.
On China, our forecast is that it will navigate a slowdown from 7.3 per cent in 2014 to around 7 per cent in 2015 in its transition to a more sustainable market-driven economy, with some monetary policy support. This is far from the hard landing many projected. Finally, there is only one economy in the world which is circa 2 trillion dollars, and where GDP growth is likely to be at 6 per cent-plus and on the upswing — and that is India. Asia will remain central for global growth.
The forecast growth for India may be 6 per cent plus, but industry seems to be getting impatient with over six months since Narendra Modi became prime minister...
I think that is too overcritical an argument. In the past six months, Mr Modi has clearly captured the imagination of the public, delivered empowerment to bureaucrats and re-ignited the confidence of both global and domestic investors. In fact in a short time period, he has clearly become a very significant voice amongst global leaders. In my view, Mr Modi is a gamechanger as far as India is concerned and puts India absolutely, right back on the global stage.
There have been grassroot reforms like the gas price hike, ordinance on coal auctions, market linking of diesel prices, foreign direct investment in railways and defence etc. Mr Modi has promised that labour, land and tax reforms, the three most significant yet most challenging reforms, will be on the agenda next. However, it is true that the greenfield capex cycle is still 12 months away, especially the ones from the private sector. I think the public sector will take the lead on this.
Why is it 12 months away? Why are greenfield projects not taking off?
There are three reasons. One, there is growing concern around global growth. The sharp oil price decline, if demand-side driven, accentuates this fear. Secondly, there is excess capacity in several industries globally. Finally, let's face it, there are labour and land acquisition issues that are stumbling blocks for Make in India greenfield projects. Some of these reforms have to be enacted before corporates can put new capital to work. Strategic capital does take longer to re-build confidence.

India Incs borrowing cost falls on RBIs rate cut hintIndia Inc’s borrowing cost falls on RBI’s rate cut hint

(Others such as IDFC, SAIL,…)
MUMBAI: Cheap money is becoming the norm even in India irrespective of the Reserve Bank of India's intentions. Government-owned Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Andhra Bank have gained in terms of cost of borrowings after the December 2 bi-monthly policy came out. Others are soon likely to follow in their footsteps.
Last week, PFC raised nearly Rs 3,500 crore in a single day offering 10-15 basis points lower rate than its earlier bond issue a few weeks ago. It offered bonds with five, seven and 10-year maturities at 8.52 per cent, 8.55 per cent and 8.48 per cent, respectively. The trend seems to have caught on. Andhra Bank will raise Rs 1,000 crore in a bond sale at 9.55 per cent, at 85 basis points lower than what it had planned to offer a month ago but the management postponed it sensing softening of rates soon after the RBI credit policy, dealers told ET. Issuers could not be contacted for their comments. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. Bond yields and prices move in the opposite direction. Others such as IDFC, SAIL, Power Grid Corporation, NTPC, Bank of Baroda, Allahabad Bank and Vijaya Bank are all expected to sail through at lower rates soon.
"With banks in no hurry to cut lending rates, corporates will find the bond route a cheaper source for raising funds compared to borrowing through the loan route," said Arun Srinivasan, senior vice-president, investments (debt), ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. ICICI Bank , HDFC Bank , State Bank of India , Axis Bank , Oriental Bank of Commerce and IDBI Bank have so far reduced deposit rates by 10-75 basis points but refrained from slashing their base rate, or the minimum rate below which lenders cannot lend. In its latest policy, the Reserve Bank of India did not cut the key policy rate, or repo, but issued a dovish outlook that has spurred rate cut expectations. If the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, it had said.
"Issuers across the board were keenly waiting for a dovish monetary policy statement," said Ajay Manglunia, senior vice-president, Edelweiss Securities . "The rate cut may happen earlier than expected as macro data like fiscal deficit & current account deficit has started showing signs of improvement along with benign inflation."
Infrastructure lending major triple-A rated IDFC would be raising Rs 500-1,000 crore this week with three and 10-year maturities at 8.43 per cent and 8.49 per cent, which are about 90-100 bps cheaper than its earlier issue about a month ago.
Power Grid, too, is looking to raise about Rs 3,500 crore offering rates of about 50 bps lower than its previous offering. Bank of Baroda is also aiming to mop up about Rs 1,500 crore for 10 years at an estimated yield of 9.40 per cent by selling bonds complaint with Basel-III, an international standard.
Demand from overseas investors remains robust as the limit for $25 billion government securities investment is almost full. Benchmark yields, according to bond dealers, may further dip 7.70-7.75 per cent by March if not earlier. On the domestic front, mutual funds, banks and some insurance companies are seen investing in these corporate securities.
"We will see a reasonable fall in yields in the next 12-18 months driven by the structural improvements on the macro front," said Amit Tripathi, head of fixed income at Reliance Mutual Fund . "The benchmark 10-year yields could move down a further by 50-100 bps over the same time period."

Is China scare a precursor to correction in global mktsIs China scare a precursor to 10% correction in global markets?
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Dec 10, 2014, 11.43AM IST

(The slowdown in China has…)
MUMBAI: The global markets on Tuesday reacted negatively to a sharp sell-off in the Chinese market, on reports that lower-rated bonds can't any longer be used as collateral for some short-term loans in China.
The Shanghai Composite closed over 5.4 per cent lower. It is up 0.39 per cent in trade today, but concerns of slowdown and risk of hard landing remain. There are concerns of slowdown in Japan and other European countries as well.
The question arises: Is it the beginning of a sharp global correction over the next two months?
Following a sharp correction in China, markets in Greece saw worst selling since 1987 on concerns that the Syriza party might come to power. The global markets have managed to pull back, but volatility and more such shocks can't be ruled out.
Andrew Holland , CEO, Ambit Investment Advisors, remains a bit cautious going into 2015. "The fall in crude oil prices could be on account of lack of demand arising from China," he says.
"It has been great news on the oil front. I have seen forecasts out there, saying it could go to $45 or $50 over the course of 2015. It is indeed great news for India. But what worries me is why this is happening," Holland told ET Now.
"Everyone is talking about the supply side. But I am not buying that. It is actually a demand problem and it is coming from China. It is not just oil price that is going down; all commodity prices are on a downslide," he said.
According to him, China could easily go into a 'demand shock' and markets are not factoring that in.
"I would not be surprised if we saw a bit of sell-off in January. This sell-off will probably arise out of demand shock from China. There could be at least a 10 per cent fall in global markets," he added.
The slowdown in China has so far affected the global commodities market. Despite the easy monetary policies from China, the commodities market has failed to pick up.
The People's Bank of China unexpectedly cut interest rates in November and raised hopes of quantitative easing going forward.
"Earlier the commodity prices engine was actually the Chinese economy. There we are actually seeing the slowdown," said Ashok Gautam , Senior VP & Head-Global Markets, Treasury, Axis Bank.
"If China again starts becoming a story for the commodities actually to take the lead and start going up, we will have to give it sometime because China really is seeing a slowdown," he added.
However, a correction in global markets will be an ideal opportunities for investors to buy stocks in the Indian markets. The Indian economy looks more poised for growth. The RBI is expected to cut interest rates in February 2015.
"The global markets are something that you need to watch out for. Purely from an investor point of view, these are the markets to go and deploy. Starting from frontline boys, concentrating on some of the safe bets sectors such as IT, pharma and FMCG to name a few. Then moving on to auto, banking and some of the oil marketing company names," said Gaurang Shah, VP, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.
According to dealers, the Indian markets may witness a time-wise correction till early next year. The next big triggers for the markets will be third quarter results, RBI policy and the Union Budget.

Retail inflation likely fell to 4.5% in NovemberRetail inflation likely fell to record low of 4.5 per cent in November, shows poll
Anu Bararia     Bangalore   Last Updated: December 10, 2014  | 16:42 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The country's consumer (or CPI-based) inflation likely fell to a record low in November, dragged down by falling food and fuel prices, while growth in core industries nudged factory output up in October, a Reuters poll showed.
The latest survey of 36 economists forecast that the country's retail inflation cooled from October's 5.52 per cent to an annual rate of 4.50 per cent, which would be the lowest since the government started releasing the data in 2012.
The government is set to release official retail inflation data on Friday (December 12).
Wholesale price (or WPI-based) inflation was forecast to slow to 1.41 per cent in November from 1.77 per cent in October, making a new five-year low. Official data for the same will be released on December 15.
"Continued steep declines in food and fuel prices, as well as subdued core pressures, mean that consumer price inflation is likely to have dropped to a record low in November," wrote Shilan Shah, Capital Economics' India economist, in a note.
While expecting some acceleration in inflation during coming months, partly due to the unwinding of a favourable base effect, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised hopes at its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy review on Dec 2 that it would cut interest rates once it became sure that inflationary pressures were waning.
The poll by Reuters also forecast that production at domestic factories , mines and utilities rose at an annual rate of 2.80 per cent in October compared to 2.50 per cent in September.
Data last week showed annual infrastructure output, which accounts for more than a third of overall factory production, accelerated to a four-month high of 6.3 per cent in October.
The rising trend in industrial production will probably continue, according to a private survey earlier in December, which showed strong demand meant factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in nearly two years in November.
The positive data suggests the economy may be gaining momentum after losing some steam in the July-September quarter of the current financial year.
"A recovery is certainly underway. Its sustainability depends critically on the continued efforts by the government to resolve the issues surrounding stalled projects," said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.

Club of Rome meet to address food securityClub of Rome meet to address food security 
Tomojit Basu
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct. 28:  
It’s one thing to draft policies, another to implement them holistically. Policy coherence with a focus on food security is what the Indian chapter of the Club of Rome (CoR), a global think tank established in 1968, intends to pursue at its two-day annual conference that begins on Thursday.
Progressive thinking has been CoR’s forte over the decades. In 1972, the group commissioned ‘The Limits To Growth’ report, based on a mathematical model that explored the interaction between exponential economic and population growth and finite resources. Hitherto a subject largely absent in public debate, the report brought the question of sustainable development to the fore and is still quoted some 40 years later.
“The essence of CoR is to think systems and inter-linkages between different sectors and policy initiatives and to see that they add up to a net-positive outcome. We thought we’d push for policy coherence in food security since our policy-making systems often pull in different directions,” said Ashok Khosla, President, CoR, Indian National Association for CoR.
The conference will bring politicians, bureaucrats, economists and agri-scientists together to discuss food security policies from socio-economic and political viewpoints. Importantly, it also aims to address how policies can help scale up social entrepreneurship, a growing field in India, alongside agricultural innovations.
“There are five million newborns affected by malnutrition each year. Food security, particularly in developing nations like India, is interesting due to the many related aspects, from trade, water and energy policies, land ownership, the environment etc. All of these subjects play a role in the supply-demand scenario,” said Khosla.
“So ultimately this conference will look at healthier, more systemic and long-term policymaking on food security and explore the unintended consequences of policies that seemingly don’t impact food production. MGNREGA, for example, is a landmark policy that’s helped generate rural employment and increased access to food. It’s also led to a shortage of farm labour which has impacted production,” he added.
The National Food Security Act (2013), while “an incredible gesture”, runs the risk of neutralizing itself and the participants at the conference will attempt to thrash out implications at different levels of implementation. “Food security is non-negotiable but how it’s done without undermining itself in a few years is the question,” Khosla told Business Line.
Among those slated to attend the two-day event are Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth, former Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh, M.S. Swaminathan along with senior faces from the National Dairy Development Board, Indian Council for Agricultural Research, Borlaug Institute for South Asia, World Future Council among others.

Govt extends Food Security Act by 3 monthsGovt extends Food Security Act by 3 months
Abhishek Law
Tweet
Kolkata, June 28:  
The National Food Security Act has been extended by three months, Union Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Minister, Ramvilas Paswan said here on Saturday.
The three-month extension comes against an appeal by the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government to extend implementation time the Act by six months.
Paswan, today met the State Consumer Affairs Minister, Sadhan Pandey, where the request for extending implementation of the National Food Security Act was said to be made.
West Bengal is amongst the many states that are yet to implement the Act. Passed by the Congress-led UPA, the Act was said to be implemented by July this year.
However, so far only 5 states have fully implemented it and 6 have done so partially.
Although the Act was passed in September 2013, the ordinance was issued in July last year.
The Food Security Act gives legal entitlement to highly subsidised foodgrains. Each eligible person would get 5 kg of of rice and wheat at 3/kg and 2 a kg.

Passwords have their own stories. Lets hear yoursPasswords have their own stories. I’m asking to hear them
By Ian Urbina | Yahoo India –  Wed 10 Dec, 2014
Print
Credit: New York Times
A man wrote that he still did not understand why for 20 years he used “Troop 64” for his password since it was a reference to a summer camp from his youth where a counselor molested him and a dozen other boys.
“Arafat” was the password of a woman who worked at an Orthodox Jewish law firm. She figured it was the last thing anyone would guess.
Others: the name of a family dog that was killed by an errant driver, the model of his first handgun, the brand of a drum set lost when a childhood home burned down, the name of a chemistry teacher who inspired her career.
Few things are as universally despised as passwords: the strains they put on our memory, the endless demand to update them, their sheer number. But there is more to passwords than their annoyance. In our authorship of them, in the fact that we construct them so that we (and only we) will remember them, they take on secret lives. Things hide inside these codes, not just behind them.
Many of our passwords are suffused with metaphor, mischief, sometimes even pathos. “One-word poems” is how someone described them to me. “Homemade prompts for mindful moments.” Often they have rich back-stories. A motivational mantra, a swipe at the boss, a hidden shrine to a lost love, an inside joke with ourselves, a defining emotional scar — they are like chotchkes of our inner lives. They derive from anything — scripture, horoscopes, nicknames, lyrics, book passages. Like a tattoo on a private part of the body, they tend to be intimate, compact, and expressive.
These ‘‘keepsake passwords,’’ as I like to call them, were the focus of a recent story I wrote in The New York Times Magazine about “ the secret life of passwords .” There was the former prisoner whose password included what used to be his inmate identification number (“a reminder not to go back,” he explained); the fallen-away Catholic whose passwords incorporated the Virgin Mary (“it’s secretly calming”); the childless 45-year-old woman whose password was the name of baby boy she lost in utero (“my way of trying to keep him alive, I guess”). These passwords were a bit like clown cars. Open the door and an impossible amount came spilling out.
A friend told me about what the financial-services firm Cantor Fitzgerald went through shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks. He described how, not but hours after the planes struck, Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of that company, had to call the families of the dead. More than 650 Cantor Fitzgerald employees, died that day, including Mr. Lutnick’s brother.
In making those phone calls, Mr. Lutnick consoled the families. But he also, ever so gently, had to collect from these families personal trivia about their missing loved ones in order to help a team of Microsoft technicians hack the passwords of dozens of the firm’s most important accounts. My friend said I could not attribute the anecdote to him. So I called Mr. Lutnick directly. He cried while recounting the experience.
At least as surprising as the stories hidden in these passwords has been people’s willingness, eagerness even, to talk about them. Unpacking these keepsakes seems to offer a catharsis of sorts to all that is frustrating about the digital moment. With so much information flowing over us, so many gadgets to tame, so many passwords to manage, renew, and not write down, the topic soothes the ire. Whatever fulfillment others derived from the topic, I too found it oddly affirming. For me, it highlighted how humans are creative and sentimental creatures, how we invent quirky routines and clever contraptions for everyday life, how we beautify even our shackles.
These are the very passwords that security experts tell us not to make because they are the easiest to crack. And yet, so many people have them. This defiance intrigued me. So, too, did broader questions about whether there might actually be a certain deeper logic to the irrationality, patterns in the misbehavior or a reason that we so often do what the experts say not to.
Still, I’m unsure how much I think keepsake passwords actually reveal about a person. Does being secret make something truer or more candid? “Creating them is like a game of word association — with no starting word,” Jonathan Zittrain, a law professor at Harvard who studies the Internet, told me. Helen Petrie, a British psychologist and professor of human/computer interaction at City University in London, described passwords as “a 21st-century Rorschach inkblot test.”
My view is that while they may not bare our souls, these passwords do represent pages, or perhaps pieces of pages, torn from our mental diaries. That has been enough for me to want to keep collecting them. That is also why I am asking people to email me ( urbina@nytimes.com ) with the stories behind their passwords. I don’t want to know your current passwords. I am, however, interested to hear the vignettes locked inside your old passwords, and the logic that makes these passwords memorable and personal.

Online retailers turn marketing focus to mob...Online retailers like Flipkart, Snapdeal turn marketing focus to mobiles
Jayadevan PK, ET Bureau Dec 11, 2014, 04.46AM IST

Amazon
(Indian e-commerce companies…)
BENGALURU: Flipkart is giving the Google-run Great Online Shopping Festival a miss this year because the biggest Indian online retailer is promoting its own mobile app. Snapdeal is participating, but pushing its mobile app as well.
Indian e-commerce companies are changing their customer-acquisition strategy and are enticing people with offers to install their apps on mobile phones. They expect the move to create more loyal customers than those who land on the portal through online searches.
For search giant Google, this growing trend underlines the need to expand mobile offerings to retain its healthy rate of growth in a market where more people are expected to access the Internet on the mobile than on desktop.
"The ecommerce industry is now mcommerce in India; the way you reach out to customers is very different even from a year ago when other digital channels were more prominent," said Mausam Bhatt, senior director for mobile commerce & digital marketing at Flipkart. Flipkart and the local operations of US ecommerce giant Amazon get more than half their India traffic through mobile phones. And, these companies are increasingly spending on mobile-related promotions.
Bhatt declined to provide details on Flipkart's marketing expenditure. Traditionally, its spending has mostly been on search engine and display advertising, but he said there has been a large shift in spending to expand the number of customers having its mobile app installed on their phones.
"An app install is an endorsement that someone wants to shop with you," said Kishore Thota, head of digital marketing at Amazon India. While Thota still counts search and display advertising as an important part of Amazon's marketing strategy, he says from a long term point of view, "We definitely see more investment going into app presence."
This shift means Google may have to work harder for the advertising dollar. For Google, which posted more than Rs 3,000 crore in India revenue for FY14, ecommerce has contributed to the 47 per cent growth in revenue over the previous year. For many years, search engine marketing, or advertising on search queries, has been the mainstay of online businesses. The other major form of advertising online was display advertising. Google is the leader in both.
As more and more consumers move to mobile, both forms of traditional advertising have been slowing. The first by the proliferation of apps and the second by the smaller screen sizes that make it tough for display advertising. "You have to really earn the real estate on mobile," said Thota.
One-time purchases, like buying insurance or car will still be influenced by a Google search while regular actions like recharging a mobile, ordering a cab or ordering food, will see app install and more loyalty, said Naman Sarawagi, founder and chief executive of comparison shopping site FindYogi.
Google, though, has a few things going for it. "There is a shift in revenue from SEM (search engine marketing) as we know it, but with products like Google Maps and Google Now, Google still has significant stake in the future of interaction, thereby safeguarding its search and discovery based revenue," said Sarawagi.
 
Google's mobile revenue is already supporting its growth globally. In the US, market research firm eMarketer estimates that search revenue from desktop computers will decline to $10 billion this year from $10.8 billion in 2013. But mobile search revenue is expected to grow to $5.1 billion from $3.1 billion. According to the estimate, Google's total advertising revenue will increase 14 per cent to $43.5 billion in 2014.
"The shift to mobile is one we welcome and in Asia the change is happening faster than anywhere else in the world," said Praveen Sharma, director-performance at Google-APAC. Sharma said Google has driven hundreds of millions of app downloads through these formats.
The trend isn't limited to India or Asia. According to eMarketer, desktop search in the US will decline significantly this year, as mobile search ad spending grows.
In India, mobile advertising has steadily grown in proportion of the total digital market, to 14 per cent in the fiscal year through March 2014 from 7 per cent in fiscal 2012, according to the Internet and Mobile Association of India's latest report.
In the same period, contribution of search to total advertising revenue has gone down to 30 per cent from 34 per cent. Display advertising has also gone down in proportion as social media and video advertising have grown. The total digital advertising market is expected to reach Rs 3,575 crore in fiscal 2015 from Rs 2,750 crore last year.
To serve its growing mobile clientele, the search giant has also launched advertising solutions for the mobile world. This year, Google launched app promotions advertising formats across its products including search, display network and YouTube.

SpiceJet s $4-billion order for 737 Max aircraft intact  says BoeingRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
Despite the recent financial woes that have led SpiceJet to cut down fleet and operations, the airline’s scheduled delivery of 42 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, worth over $4 billion, remains intact with the first aircraft set to be delivered by the end of 2018.
“The order (by SpiceJet) very much holds even though the airline is working towards reducing debt and getting back to healthier finances,” Dinesh A Keskar, Boeing’s vice-president (sales) for Asia Pacific and India, said in a telephonic interview.
“Our track record is very good and not a single Boeing order has so far been canceled. We don’t expect SpiceJet to cancel or reduce their order,” Keskar added.
When asked about the status of the Boeing order, a SpiceJet spokesperson said the airline didn’t want to comment on the issue.
During the last two months or so, billionaire Kalanithi Maran-controlled SpiceJet has gradually reduced its Boeing 737 fleet size to 22 planes, down from the 37 it operated earlier this year. Salaries have been delayed and the airline has faced regulatory scrutiny, following a spate of cancellations aimed at cutting costs. The airline has also failed to get an external investor on board despite trying for the last two years.
Recently, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) barred SpiceJet from accepting bookings for travel more than a month in advance. According to a Bloomberg report, DGCA has also cancelled 183 of the airline’s landing and parking slots. However, Boeing is confident that recovery for SpiceJet is around the corner.
By cutting fleet size SpiceJet has reduced its monthly expenses on fleet lease significantly. It has started deploying its aircraft on most profitable routes, scrapping the loss-making routes, Keskar said. “We are obviously cautiously optimistic on SpiceJet,” he added.
Boeing’s Keskar said that as many as 2,500 orders for Boeing 737 Max aircraft have been placed with the company by various airlines and leasing companies. The first aircraft of this configuration, which is expected to roll out in 2017, will, however, reach SpiceJet only during the final quarter of calendar year 2018.

In reform mode  govt tables bill to auction coal blocksBy: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:11 am
Taking a step towards reforming the coal sector, the government Wednesday introduced a bill in Parliament to auction coal blocks to power, steel and cement producing companies, likely from the next month.
Tabling the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Bill 2014, Coal Minister Piyush Goyal told the Lok Sabha that the legislation was necessitated in the wake of the Supreme Court’s September 24 decision to cancel 204 coal blocks. He added that the government moved ahead with the Bill to avert a crisis in electricity generation, save lakhs of workers from being rendered jobless and prevent thousands of crores of bank funds from turning into “stressed assets”.
Introducing the Bill had also become a necessity to replace the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 2014 implemented in October to facilitate auctioning of cancelled coal mines. Passage of the legislation would pave way to bid out 74 ready-to-mine coal blocks.
Goyal refuted the contention of the TMC and Left MPs that the bill sought to de-nationalise coal mines in the country and facilitate total exploitation of the mines and their workers.
As per the Bill, any prior allottee convicted for an offence relating to coal block allocations and sentenced with imprisonment for more than three years, would be barred from participating in the auction. Also, any private company entering a joint venture with a state-run entity would be able to hold a maximum of 26 per cent stake in the firm.
The Bill envisages appointing a ‘nominated authority’ for conducting the auction process and allotment of mines with the assistance of experts, executing the vesting order for transfer and vesting cancelled coal mines. The authority will collect proceeds of the auction and pass them on to the states where the auctioned mines are located. Firms, which have lost their blocks have been allowed by the Supreme Court to bid for the mines by paying an additional levy of Rs 295 per metric tonne of coal extracted from them. Any dispute between the existing allocattees and winning bidders would be settled through a tribunal to be constituted under the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957.
While the blocks to be auctioned would have land free of any encumbrances, the clearances secured by the existing allocattees would also get passed to successful bidders. However, it is yet to be known how the bidders would be facilitated for blocks which either do not have green clearances or have expired ones.

CBI likely to file closure report soonBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 1:08 am
The CBI is likely to file a closure report in court in the next few days in the case of two teenage girls, who were found hanging from a tree in their village in Badaun in May.
Initially believed to be a case of gangrape and murder, the CBI eventually concluded that it was actually a case of double suicide.
“We are likely to file the closure report in court in the Badaun case either tomorrow or in the next few days,” a CBI source said on Wednesday.
The CBI recently said that questioning of over 200 people, along with the results of 40 scientific reports, led it to the conclusion that the cousin girls had committed suicide.
The CBI had said that reports from forensic laboratories and a three-member medical board, and its investigations had revealed that the allegations levelled against the five accused in the FIR were false, and the wrong people were arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police.
The elder of the two minor girls had an intimate relationship with the main accused, Pappu Yadav, and it was an evening meeting between the two that triggered the events that led to the double suicide, the CBI claimed.
The CBI’s findings in the closure report are likely to lead to charges of filing a false case and destruction of evidence against the family of the two victims and a witness, sources said.
The girls were found hanging from a mango tree near their village on May 28. Based on their autopsy, it was initially believed that they were sexually assaulted and hanged.
The girls’ families had alleged that they were kidnapped and murdered by five youths from the village.

HC stops sale of Xiaomi phones
The order was passed on the plea of Ericsson that Xiaomi has been violating its eight patents pertaining to AMR, EDGE and 3G technologies in the field of telecommunication.
Post your opinion here
 
The Delhi High Court in an interim order has restrained Xiaomi as well as online e-commerce site Flipkart from selling in India handsets of the Chinese mobile maker that run on the technology patented by Ericsson.
The court has also restrained Xiaomi or its agents from making, assembling, importing or offering for sale its devices which are infringing the mobile phone technology patented by Ericsson.
Justice G P Mittal directed the customs authorities to prevent import of Xiaomi phones that are infringing the patents of Ericsson and if any consignment is imported, the same be informed to Ericsson and its objections be decided as per the Intellectual Property Rules.
"I am satisfied that plaintiff (Ericsson) has made out a prima facie case for grant of ad interim injunction in its favour. The balance of convenience also lies in favour of plaintiff and in the absence of an injunction order, plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and injury," the court said.
It also issued summons and notice to Xiaomi and Flipkart and directed them to file an affidavit disclosing the number of devices - that are AMR, EDGE and 3G compliant - sold by them in India till date.

They have to also indicate in the affidavit the revenue earned by selling these devices till date.
The court has also appointed three local commissioners to visit the premises of Xiaomi and Flipkart where the devices are stored in order to inspect and collect documents as well as seal the infringing mobiles.
The total fees of the local commissioners, amounting to Rs 3.5 lakh shall be borne by Ericsson apart from travel and stay expenses, it said.
The local commissioners have to submit their report within four weeks, it also said.
The order was passed on the plea of Ericsson that Xiaomi has been violating its eight patents pertaining to AMR, EDGE and 3G technologies in the field of telecommunication.
Ericsson has said that it had invited Xiaomi to use its patented technology by obtaining a licence, but instead of doing so, the Chinese manufacturer launched its devices in India in July 2014.

Agra conversion row grows bigger  Muslim groups demand action and protectionComments
Islamic organisations took to the streets on Wednesday protesting the alleged forced conversion of 57 Muslim families to Hinduism and demanding protection to vulnerable members of the community.
A meeting was held at Mantola, a Muslim-majority area, where protesters blocked the main road running through it.
Leaders and clerics cautioned the district administration to impose strict checks on people loyal to hard-line Hindu outfits such as the Bajrang Dal.
Mufti Abdul Khubeb Rumi condemned the alleged trickery used by organisers of Monday’s conversion camp to lure poor Muslim families into it with the promise of ration cards and other doles.
He said those involved in wrongful deeds must be brought to book but appealed to Muslims to adopt “peaceful measures to counter notorious elements indulging in conversions”.
The mufti said these families would continue to be Muslim despite their conversion because there’s no need for a re-entry into Islam.
“There had been queries regarding the religious status of these 57 families. These Muslims have denied being converted to Hinduism and so they continue to be Muslim.”
Cleric Syed Ikhtiyar Jafri echoed the mufti’s views. “Any conversion made under force or forgery is no conversion. It is matter of belief and once they stated that they haven’t switched to Hinduism, there is no need for them to follow any formal ritual to return to Islam.”
Haji Jamiluddin Qureshi, president of the Rashtriya Sarvdaliya Muslim Action Committee, held the the Narendra Modi government responsible for not restraining groups like the Bajrang Dal from fomenting trouble. “Such incidents have created an atmosphere of fear among Muslims and sparked communalism. Bajrang Dal people intend to disturb the peace and harmony.”
Later, the protesters submitted a memorandum to the additional district magistrate and the superintendent of police. SP Sameer Saurabh said forces were stationed at sensitive places.

Bajaj s gamble with Discover 150 pays offBajaj's gamble with Discover 150 pays off
Swaraj Baggonkar | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 09:35 AM IST
Despite hiccups, Bajaj Auto's yet another gamble with the Discover brand has paid off. Launched nearly four months ago, the stylish Discover 150 has become a runaway success for the Pune-based company, with customers lining up for an upgrade.
Being the fourth model under the Discover banner, the bike is the cheapest motorcycle in its class, and faces competition from five companies that share more than a dozen models between them. 
With the exception of the Bajaj Pulsar 150, Honda Unicorn and Yamaha FZ are the two highest selling models in this segment, together controlling more than a third of the market. However, the Pulsar 150 remains the largest selling bike in the 150cc class, with a share of more than 30%. 
Brand Discover, which generates more than half of the sales for Bajaj Auto's domestic two-wheeler business, is the highest selling brand for the company. The brand has models stretching from economy (100cc) to premium (150cc) categories, with a total of eight variants.
Introduced in three variants, Bajaj claims to have sold 70,000 units of the Discover 150 in three months, making it one of the best-selling bikes in its class. With sales at little over 25,000, the model now accounts for a third of Discover's sales every month. Discover 150 has even trumped the Pulsar 135, the smallest from the Pulsar line.  
Market watchers say one of the reasons why the new Discover has been a success is because of its pricing. At Rs 51,720, the Discover 150 is positioned close to India's best-selling bike Hero Splendor. One of the better selling Splendor models sell for Rs 48,000, albeit on much lower specifications levels.
While the Splendor is powered by a 100cc powerplant, the Discover 150 comes with a 150cc engine. In addition to higher power, the Bajaj bike gets tubeless tyres, digital meter and nitrox suspension system. 
A claimed on-road mileage of 60kms per litre by the Discover 150 is close to the mileage given by most 100cc or 125cc bikes.  The bike's sportier and stylish half fairing, company officials say, is the biggest draw. 
Eric Vaz, president (motorcycle business), Bajaj Auto said, "We did not expect the half fairing version to have such a demand. We were struggling to meet its demand in the initial few weeks. In the 150cc class there is no other bike which comes with a fairing"
The half fairing version is the top-end model costing around Rs 59,000. According to Vaz, more than 50% of sales of the bike comes from the half fairing version. "We hit a high of 30,000 units and we expect the volumes to stabilise at around 25,000 units per month from here on."
But will the Discover 150 beat the blues of the past where Bajaj Auto has failed to keep the success of a particular model going? The company has not only launched and progressively phased out series of models over the years but one-time best sellers have also found it difficult to maintain their consistencies.

Sugar stocks rally after government fixes ethanol price for OMCsSugar stocks rally after government fixes ethanol price for OMCs
SI Reporter | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 09:31 AM IST
Shares of sugar companies have rallied by up to 13% on the bourses after the government fixes a price of Rs 48.50-49.50 per litre for procurement of ethanol for blending with petrol.
The Cabinet Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) fixed the delivered price of Ethanol in the range of Rs 48.50 per litre to Rs 49.50 per litre, depending upon the distance of sugar mill from the depot/installation of the public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs), the PTI report suggests.
The rate fixed by the government is much higher than the price oil companies presently pay to buy the sugarcane extract. Oil firms presently pay about Rs 29/litre for ethanol, added report.
Simbhaoli Sugars has rallied 13% at Rs 16 on BSE, followed by Bajaj Hindusthan (8% at Rs 22.75), Shree Renuka Sugars (7.8% at Rs 18.15), Balrampur Chini Mills (up 7.5% at Rs 63.05) and Dhampur Sugar Mills (6.6% at Rs 48.65). The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex was down 0.44% at 27,709 at 0924 hours.

Australia pledged its support for Ukraine during a visit by the nation’s president on Thursday, with Australia’s prime minister calling for an end to the bloody conflict in Eastern Europe and Ukraine’s leader urging Russia to withdraw.
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a sharp critic of Russia since Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in July over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, said Russia must honor a little-respected cease-fire agreement signed in September.
Asked by a journalist if Australia was taking sides in a European war, Abbott replied: “The side we take is the side of freedom, democracy and self-determination…. And plainly, freedom, democracy and self-determination are currently at risk in parts of Eastern Europe.”
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in Australia for a three-day visit, urged Russia to withdraw from the region, where both sides have been engaged in a one-day truce that Poroshenko proposed in a bid to revive the September cease-fire deal.
“Please stop the fire. Please release the hostages. Please withdraw your troops from my territory. Please close the border,” Poroshenko said during a press conference in Melbourne. “And I promise if you close the border, within one, two, three weeks, we have peace and stability in Ukraine. Very simple.”
Australia and Ukraine have formed close ties over the Flight 17 disaster, which killed everyone on board, including 38 Australian citizens and residents. Abbott and other Western leaders have accused Russia of providing military support for those who shot down the plane. Russian state-run TV has blamed Ukraine’s air force.
“If it turns out that people under Russian authority had a hand in this, we absolutely expect them to be surrendered to investigators and to prosecutors because this is an atrocity,” Abbott said. “It was mass murder on a vast scale.”
The two also discussed a potential energy export deal, with the Ukrainian president saying his country may buy Australian uranium for its nuclear power stations, along with coal.
“Australia is an energy superpower and energy security is very important to Ukraine, particularly given its current vulnerability to supply shocks,” Abbott said.

Tension in Muzaffarnagar over conversion toHinduismBy: Press Trust of India | Muzaffarnagar |

The conversion issue is already in focus in the state over the alleged forced reconversion of about 100 people to Hinduism in Agra. An FIR has been filed against an RSS wing behind the incident .

Solar can be for India what shale is for US | Should India build big coal power projectsSolar power can be for India what shale is for the US

(The Centre should provide…)
By Akhil Gupta, Akhil Handa & Mayank Rawat
The new government has unfurled plans to build 100 gw of solar power by 2022. Here are a few suggestions to execute this grand vision:
First, it's time the general perception that solar energy is expensive is removed. India gets 70% more solar radiation than European countries. This means the same solar panels yield 70% more power in India. In addition, peak demand in India coincides for 70-80% of the time during which solar energy is harnessed. This peak demand is mostly met by diesel, which costs almost double that of solar electricity, currently at Rs 6-7 per kWh.
So, when we commission a solar plant, it will displace diesel for 70-80% of its generation and imported coal for the rest. At all times, solar is substituting for imported energy, which is far more expensive.
Second, adequate capital should be raised without crowding out investments in other sectors. The proposed 100 gw capacity requires about $125 billion, of which $90 billion will be debt financing. The global financial crisis has created a great opportunity for availing cheaper credit from global markets. As per International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates, green energy will receive almost 60% of the $5 trillion expected to be invested in new power plants over the next decade. Solar's requirement is less than 2% of this amount.
The Holy Grail of successful financing is effective allocation of risks between different stakeholders — in this case the consumer, the investor, central/state governments and the developer. The development cost and schedule risk are best borne by technically competent solar power developers once a power purchase agreement (PPA) is signed with a state electricity board (SEB). The developer is in the best situation to procure land, negotiate for panel prices with investors and execute the project expeditiously.
  Fortunately, solar power requires far fewer clearances than for coal and doesn't require contiguous land. The government should put a 25 mw per bid floor to ensure technical and financial competence of the bidder.
A big part of solar energy costs is the cost of debt, since fuel costs are zero and operational costs are minimal. Any action by government to reduce interest cost will reduce the cost of solar energy and accelerate its adoption. A foreign lender will view depreciation of currency as a risk since the tariff is designated in rupees and will want to be compensated for that higher risk.
The government/RBI should mitigate that risk away from foreign lenders. This potentially has no cost to the government/RBI since implementation of solar energy will contribute to the appreciation of the rupee. This is because we estimate forex savings of more than $500 billion over a 25-year period from the commissioning of 100 gw solar power and substituting the use of diesel and imported coal.
The developer is incurring a major portion of costs in dollars, but is shielding the consumer from rupee depreciation risk by designating the tariff in rupees. Solar investments' dollar economic internal rate of return to the Indian economy is in the high teens while the borrowing of debt could be only at 5-6%. The economic surplus from each project is transferred to and aggregated in the larger Indian economy. Hence, the role of the RBI and government is perfectly justified and is crucial in achieving this grand vision.
If developers can avail of the debt in rupee at 5-6% — i.e. at the same interest as that of international dollar denominated debt, they can provide solar power at less than Rs 5/kWh, and that too with no escalation in future. They also don't strain the domestic banks and can raise all the debt abroad.
The government can easily raise about $15-20 billion per annum over the next five years from external sources including NRIs, multilateral agencies, development banks, sovereign wealth funds and lend directly to projects once the PPA is signed up. This will also accelerate development of solar projects since raising debt financing for individual projects can consume a lot of resources.
One must also ensure reliability of cashflows from solar projects. There are substantial credit risks which hound the power sector due to the deteriorating credit profile of the SEBs and the lax enforcement of the renewable purchase obligation (RPO) mechanism. The state government needs to backstop the PPAs with the SEBs and ensure strict compliance of the RPOs.
The Centre should provide a guarantee that if states/SEBs do not pay their solar developer in time, they will step up and take it out of allocation to the states. Only those states that sign up for this programme should be entitled to the foreign exchange risk covered by the central government/RBI and avail of cheap solar power.
The benefits of tapping into our own clean energy source are unmatchable from an energy security viewpoint, climate change mitigation, adoption of future-proof technology and developing quicker power sources, generation of employment accelerating our growth rate. There is little doubt that the government needs to ensure reliable and cost-effective energy supply to ensure making the 'Make in India' programme a resounding success. There are few initiatives so impactful and so easily doable for our country. Solar can be the shale equivalent of India.

Foxconn halts TN operations over Nokia shutdownFoxconn halts Tamil Nadu operations over Nokia shutdown

The Foxconn plant was set up with the express intent to supply to Nokia and the facility cannot used for making smartphone components.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
CHENNAI: Electronics component manufacturer Foxconn said it will suspend operations at its eight-year-old facility in Chennai as its only customer, the now mothballed plant of Nokia, stopped production in October. The shutdown of FIH India Pvt Ltd will be effective December 24, the company said in a news release.
Management representatives of the plant and union members are set to work on the final settlement formalities at a local labour office on Friday. Foxconn India's only client was the Finnish phone-maker Nokia, to which it has been supplying panels. "The winding down of Foxconn could just have not been prevented," a management member told ET.
Nokia's Chennai factory had been seized by tax authorities, accusing the company of evading tax, a charge it denies. Because of the tax dispute, the facility wasn't part of Nokia's now-completed deal to sell its telecom handset business to Microsoft.
The Foxconn plant was set up with the express intent to supply to Nokia and the facility cannot used for making smartphone components.

Fashion e-tailers Jabong  Myntra put up impressive numbersAmazon
(As Amazon chief Jeff Bezos had…)
MUMBAI: Just three years...and may be at the threshold of a revolution. Jabong and Myntra, India's biggest etailers of fashion, are clocking up impressive top line numbers and, more importantly, red hot 3-digit and 4-digit growth figures that signal a tipping point in how urban Indians will dress themselves — they will likely move most of their clothes shopping to ecommerce.
Consider the numbers. In three years of operations (2012-2014), Jabong and Myntra's combined top line has hit Rs 1,000 crore for the year ended March 2014. Growth has been more than blistering. Jabong sales in 2013-14 jumped to Rs 527 crore, from a mere Rs 4.6 crore in 2011-12 — that's an eyepopping 11,357 per cent growth in sales.
Myntra's Rs 441-crore top line in 2013-14 was an only slightly less staggering 558 per cent jump from 2011-12's Rs 67.1 crore.
And in these three years, Jabong's and Myntra's top lines have outperformed those of brick-and-mortar fashion biggies, Zara, Levis and Marks & Spencers, which have been in business in India for between 5 and 10 years.
Plus, growth in the big brickand-mortar chains, Shoppers Stop and Future Lifestyle Fashion, which have been in operations for two decades or more, has really slowed down in comparison, over the same period (see graphic).
As Amazon chief Jeff Bezos had said, the big success of fashion etailing is the biggest learning he's taken away from India.
And market analysts and fashion-conscious urban middle and upper middle classes are saying the same thing differently.
Analysts say a tipping point has been reached in etailing fashion.
Consumers say the sheer convenience of browsing through thousands of big label options from the comfort of one's home or office and the ease of returning clothes that don't fit are the reasons they will stay with buying a dress through a mouse click.
"Where will I get international brands such as Dorothy Perkins, Mango, FCUK, and not-so-highpriced Harpa and Femella all in one place? I won't ever get to browse 5,000 designs at stores and I can't go there every day braving the traffic. But I can go to the virtual store every single day and if I don't like what I have shopped, I can just return, all from the comfort of my chair," said Ruchi Sally, director at retail consultancy Elargir Solutions and an online shopper explaining the growth of online fashion retailers.
"Online retail has passed the inflection point as customers have stopped questioning its viability and authenticity," said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive at retail consultancy Third Eyesight.
Fashion etailers attribute their success to multiplier effect from good customer experience and some serious brand-building efforts.
"Apart from the acceptance of ecommerce at a macro-level, we have, over time, built our reputation through customer experience. This will now translate into higher sales as we laid a strong foundation," said Praveen Sinha, co-founder of Jabong. com. "There has been a lot of focus on branding and investment to build fashion properties and technology which will help in the long run even as though it impacts profitability now."
Jabong and Myntra also attribute their growth to an increase in its product portfolio and exclusive tieups, especially with international brands.
The Indian online retail market is estimated to grow over 4-fold to touch $14.5 billion (over Rs 88,000 crore) by 2018 on account of rapid expansion of ecommerce in the country, according to research and consultancy firm RNCOS that projects compound annual growth rate of 40-45 per cent during 2014-18. The current market size of the online retail sector has been pegged at $3.5 billion (over Rs 21,000 crore).
Fashion etailing, say market watchers, is poised to become the top category in the near future. RNCOS says while online sales account for nearly 4 per cent of the overall apparel market, as compared to 15 per cent for smartphones and between 5-10 per cent for flat panel televisions, digital cameras and personal care gadgets, the hierarchy is set to change.
"It is likely that few years down the line, apparel and accessories will take over the top slot from electronic gadgets," the RNCOS report said.
Fashion etailing in India, say pundits, is going through the classic ecommerce growth pattern at a quick pace. In a very short time, the likes of Jabong and Myntra have crossed the first two stages - attracting the first enthusiasts and seducing a wider set with product promotions. The third, really defining stage will come when clicking for a dress becomes an even wider habit.

Havells India Ltd fell 7.48 per cent, adding to its 6.9 per cent slump on Wednesday after company cuts standalone revenue forecast to 12-14 per cent from 17-20 per cent, citing weak domestic demand, according to analysts
Significant pension liabilities was seen at unit Sylvania in due to drop in bond yields, analysts added.
At 11:29 a.m., the stock was trading at Rs 288.55, down 7.10 per cent or Rs 22.05 on the BSE.
Here is what the market expert Ambareesh Baliga says in a chat with ET Now. Excerpts:
ET Now: Havells have said that there are some issues with regard to meeting the sales guidance - they have cut it from 12% to 14% versus the earlier 17% to 20%. They are also talking about the possibility of pension liabilities in the second half which may impact reported profits. What do you make of these two key things and the kind of damage we have seen in the stock already?
Ambareesh Baliga: The issue with stocks like these is that over the last two years, they have actually built up a lot of expectations from analysts as well as investors and when this sort of a news comes in, it comes in as a shocker, because of which you are seeing this cut. This could deepen further because people were not expecting this sort of a news from Havells.
ET Now: What do you think in terms of a price level - how much would the stock get dented by in lieu of this revision in revenue?
Ambareesh Baliga: It is possible that we could see another 10% to 15% cut. This is just the beginning because once this sinks in, you could see a further cut.
ET Now: Do you think the stock would settle at roughly 250 odd in the selling?
Ambareesh Baliga: May not be 250, but possibly closer to about 275 or so. Those who have missed on the way up could actually come and start buying at those lower levels because in this rally - not just across Havells but across various other stocks - people have missed out. Thus, people sitting on the sidelines could actually come in to support at those lower levels.

SpiceJet shares have fallen 24% since December 1 when the troubles at the company erupted, even though ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala picked up 75 lakh shares of SpiceJet for more than Rs 13 crore through open market route in November end.
At 11:02 a.m., Jet Airways was trading at Rs 447.5, up 2.46 per cent or Rs 10.75 on the BSE.

Ebay considering cutting 10% of workforce‘Ebay considering cutting 10% of workforce’

Tweet
Dec 11:  
Online retailer eBay Inc is mulling over a plan to cut thousands of jobs early next year, as it readies to spin off its PayPal unit, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the company's thinking.
"We are focused on running the business and setting eBay and PayPal up for success as independent companies," eBay spokeswoman Amanda Miller said, declining to specifically comment on whether the company was considering layoffs.
Ebay is considering eliminating almost 10 per cent of its workforce, or about 3,000 employees, the WSJ cited one source as saying.
The cuts are expected to be localised in the company's marketplace division, the report said.
The spin-off, announced in September, highlighted the slowing growth of eBay's traditional marketplace business.

Google the best place to work on Earth: Glassdoor listingGoogle the best place to work on Earth: Glassdoor listing
IANS | Washington Dec 11, 2014 10:22 AM IST
Ensuring a balanced work-family environment for its employees has made Google the best place to work on Earth, announces the seventh '2015 Best Places to Work' listing from Glassdoor, a US-based website that provides insider ratings and information from employees about the companies they work for.
The micro-blogging site Twitter, which was the second best company last year, has fallen off the grid and is out from the list that ranks top 50 companies to work for in the US and Britain, Glassdoor said in a statement.
Last year, it was the top rated technology company and the second best company overall.
"It is probably the single biggest change and surprise this year that Twitter did not make the list at all," Robert Hohman, co-founder and CEO of Glassdoor, was quoted as saying in an NBC News report.
At second place is Bain & Company, an American global management consulting firm headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and at third spot is Nestle Purina PetCare, a St Louis, Missouri-based subsidiary of Nestle that produces and markets pet food, treats and litter.
The social networking site Facebook has slipped to 13th position from the fifth last year while business-oriented social networking service LinkedIn has dropped from third position to 23rd spot.
Extra attention to make a balance between work and family responsibilities for its employees has nudged Google to the number one position this year, Glassdoor reported.
During the survey, Google employees cited increased paternity and adoptive parent leave to match that of mothers who give birth.

Societe Generale pulls out of GVK Hancocks long-delayed coal projectBy: Reuters |
Posted: December 8, 2014 11:12 am
Societe Generale has suspended its involvement in financing a $10 billion coal mine, rail and port project being developed by India’s GVK conglomerate and Australian billionaire Gina Rinehart, citing the project’s years-long delay.
The French bank’s decision is the latest twist for a project originally scheduled to produce coal from 2014, but which has suffered challenges from landowners and green groups, and been complicated by coal prices falling to more than five-year lows.
Developer GVK Hancock said that before seeking financing it is focused on finalising approvals for the project’s Alpha coal mine in the Galilee Basin in Queensland, fighting legal disputes against approvals already won, and securing supply agreements.
“We have been working with Societe Generale on a specific element of the financing arrangements for our projects, but are not currently working on that specific work package and as such do not require their services at this time,” GVK Hancock said in an emailed statement.
The French bank said on Twitter on Friday that, “In the context of the Alpha coal project’s delay, Societe Generale has decided, in agreement with GVK-Hancock, to suspend its mandate. The bank has therefore no involvement with the project.”
The project has been targeted by green groups opposed to coal use and by tourism operators in Queensland, where there are concerns about plans to dredge ahead of expanding a port near the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef.
Green groups, which have been pressing banks to not back coal projects, counted Societe Generale’s withdrawal as another win, following similar moves by Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings PLC, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC  and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Greenpeace France on its Facebook page called the withdrawal “good news”.
A spokeswoman at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking in Hong Kong confirmed the bank’s decision. She had no immediate comment on whether the bank would consider lending for the project when GVK Hancock is ready to seek financing.
GVK bought 79 percent stakes in the Alpha and Alpha West coal projects and a 100 percent stake in another project from Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting for $1.26 billion at the peak of the coal boom in 2011, aiming to start producing in 2014. It still owes $560 million for the purchase.

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty post worst drop in nearly 8 wks; Infosys down 5%By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai |
Posted: December 8, 2014 4:57 pm
Indian markets logged their worst single-session drop in eight weeks today with Sensex plunging about 339 points and Nifty slipping 100 points on losses in Infosys, where co-founders sold USD 1 billion worth shares, and other bluechips like TCS, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.
M&M, Sesa Sterlite, Dr Reddys, Hindalco and Tata Steel counters dropped in 2-4 per cent range. L&T, RIL and Tata Motors were also under pressure.
The 30-share BSE Sensex fell to touch the day’s low of 28,097.12 following fall in recent outperformers like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. However, the index attempted to rebound as it touched the session’s high of 28,494.85 on value buying.
Participants, however, later again resorted to selling, spread over a broad front. Sensex settled the day at 28119.40, down 338.70 points, or 1.19 per cent. On Friday, it had slipped 104.72 points on profit-selling. This 338.7-point drop is its worst since October 16 when it fell 349.99 points.
On similar lines, the NSE 50-share Nifty dipped below the key 8,500-mark by tumbling 100.05 points, or 1.17 per cent, to close, at 8,438.25. Intra-day, it traded in a range between 8,432.25 and 8,546.35. This was also its worst drop since October 16 (fall of 115.80 points).
“The decline was led by the IT counters as sentiments got a hit after some of the founders of IT major Infosys decided to sell USD 1.1 billion shares. Further, profit booking in capital goods, consumer durables and banking stocks also pushed the benchmark in red,” said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities.
Infosys counter fell 4.88 per cent, the worst performer in Sensex,. TCS tumbled 2.51 per cent and Wipro shed 1.62 per cent in line with weak trend in IT shares.
Shares of metal companies, including Sesa, Hindalco and Tata Steel, faced selling after weak Chinese trade data.
Sectorwise, BSE IT index suffered the most by losing 3.18 per cent, followed by Teck 2.58 per cent, Realty 1.80 per cent, Capital Goods 1.72 per cent and Consumer Durables 1.41 per cent. Overall, 11 of the 12 sectoral indices ended in red.
Pressure was also seen in smaller stocks. BSE Small cap index ended 0.87 per cent down while the Mid-cap index shed as much as 1.22 per cent.
Global cues were mixed with Asian bourses ending higher and Europe was down in its opening trades.
Foreign Portfolio Investors sold shares worth net Rs 109.45 crore on Friday as per provisional data.

Kerala: High court orders demolition of DLF project in KochiWritten by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram |
Posted: December 9, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: December 9, 2014 10:13 am
Portions of DLF Riverside, a premium waterfront residential project of realty major DLF in Kochi, which were constructed in violation of the CRZ rules should be demolished, said Kerala High Court on Monday.
Earlier, an expert committee had found that the DLF had encroached upon the backwaters.
The single bench of Justice A V Ramakrishna Pillai issued orders to Kochi Municipal Corporation in this regard. Cancelling the building permit the corporation had issued to DLF in 2007, the court ordered for suspension of further construction activities.
The bench of Justice A V Ramakrishna was acting upon a petition filed by a person E V Antony, who is residing near the project.
The premium residential condominium is spread over 5 acres of land along the backwaters. In five separate blocks, the project has 185 units, whose price tag is between Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 4 crore.
“The project was completed a year back and a major chunk of the units have been sold out, but not occupied as the case has been pending. We are yet to get full details of the verdict regarding the area which has to be demolished as per the court order.
However, we would definitely move an appeal in the high court. The issue with the customers who had bought units at the property would be settled through negotiations,’’ company sources in Kochi said.
Earlier, Kerala government had appointed Chief Secretary E K Bharat Bhushan to study the allegations against DLF. The government had cancelled the environmental clearance given to the project by Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority.
Bhushan, in his report, had found serious irregularities in granting sanction to construct the 21-storeyed building along the backwaters at Chelavanoor in Kochi. It was found that the company had not even obtained CRZ clearance for the project, which got all clearances within three months in 2007.
The Chief Secretary had found lapses on the part of officials of the Kerala State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority and Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority in awarding various sanctions for the apartment project.
The report had pulled up the officials of the Kochi Corporation for giving tacit consent for the illegal construction of DLF even after it was found that the reality group had encroached the water body.
Kochi Mayor Tony Chamminni said the corporation would examine how many constructions have come up along the backwaters violating the CRZ rules.

Infosys founders sell stake worth Rs 6 484 cr; Sensex dips 338 ptsBy: ENS Economic Bureau | Mumbai |
Posted: December 9, 2014 1:39 am
The families of four co-founders of Infosys sold shares worth $1.1 billion (around Rs 6,484 crore) in India’s second-largest IT services company on Monday. The sale, which led to a 4.88 per cent fall in the Infosys share to Rs 1,968.60 on the BSE on Monday, also added to the selling pressure in tech counters and weakened the general sentiment, pulling the Sensex down by 338.70 points to 28,119.40.
While the co-founders gained over Rs 6,400 crore from the sale, investors lost close to Rs 11,000 crore as market capitalisation fell to Rs 2,26,087 crore on Monday.
“Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and Dinesh K, and some of their family members, as well as wife of co-founder SD Shibulal, have sold 32.6 million shares of Infosys for approximately Rs 6,484 crore, constituting around 2.8 per cent of shares outstanding. The sale of shares was executed at an average price of Rs 1,988.87. The shares were sold to institutional investors, both FIIs and domestic,” Deutsche Equities India, the sole broker for the deal. 
As on September 30, 2014, the total promoter stake in Infosys was 15.92 per cent while foreign investors owned 42.67 per cent. The sale has happened at a time when FIIs and domestic institutions have been hiking stakes in the tech company. Infosys co-founders had recently told the company to declassify them as promoters. “The decline in the Sensex was led by the IT counters as sentiments got hit after some of the founders of IT major Infosys decided to sell shares. The stake sale leads to several questions on the future of the company,” said an analyst.
The stake sale came after former SAP official Vishal Sikka recently joined Infy as the CEO after all the original promoters left from its management positions.
Narayana Murthy, Founder of Infosys, said, “Even after this sale our family continues to be the largest shareholder among retail shareholders. We have tremendous confidence in the future of Infosys and its leaders.”
The NSE 50-share Nifty fell 100.05 points, or 1.17 per cent, to finish below key 8,500-mark at 8,438.25. This is also its sharpest fall since the 115.8-point drop on October 16. TCS fell by 2.51 per cent and Wipro 1.62 per cent. HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank lost about 1.5 per cent each.

AAI to SpiceJet: furnish Rs 200 cr bank guarantee on duesBy: Express LOL | New Delhi |
Posted: December 9, 2014 1:43 am
The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is considering putting SpiceJet on “cash-and-carry” mode soon if the airline is unable to furnish a bank guarantee of about Rs 200 crore against its dues by December 10.
With aviation regulator, directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA), also planning to issue a show cause notice to SpiceJet for defying its directive regarding advance bookings beyond a month, worse days could be ahead for the carrier. “The AAI would put SpiceJet on cash-and-carry mode from Wednesday if it does not furnish a bank guarantee to the airport operator against its dues by that time,” a senior official said.
After reviewing the financial and operational parameters of the airline on Friday, director-general of civil aviation Prabhat Kumar had issued a series of instructions to SpiceJet, also directing them to file a “convincing schedule” by December 15. DGCA had also instructed the airline not to accept bookings for cancelled flights, to refund all affected passengers within a month, and not to take advance bookings beyond a month.
While the DGCA withdrew 186 flight slots of SpiceJet at various airports across the country on Friday, the airline had said on Saturday that the advance booking restriction would be counter-productive, and it would discuss the pros and cons of this with the DGCA. On Monday, however, the airline continued to take advance bookings, even for dates in 2015.
“The DGCA is likely to issue a show cause notice to SpiceJet as the airline continues accepting advanced bookings of beyond one month against the directives on the issue,” official sources said.
Some officials also believed that a notice would be one in a series of steps that could lead to the cancellation of the airline’s licence. A SpiceJet spokesperson defended the advance bookings, saying it has already informed the regulator that it wants to discuss the issue this week. “We have told DGCA that we would like to discuss the matter and plan to do so tomorrow (Tuesday) post a board meeting,” the spokesperson said.
CAD widens to 2.1% on higher gold imports  
MUMBAI: India’s current-account deficit widened to $10.1 billion, or 2.1 per cent of the GDP, during the second quarter ended September 2014 as gold imports surged and non-resident Indian deposits almost halved.
CAD had reached a low of 1.2 per cent of GDP in the same period of last year and 1.7 per cent in the preceding quarter.
However, during the six month period of April-September of 2014-15, CAD has moderated to 1.9 per cent of GDP as against 3.1 per cent in the same period of last year due to lower trade deficit and a marginal rise in net services receipts. Gold imports had surged after the government and the RBI relaxed the import curbs on May 22. Gold imports in September alone had soared to $3.75 billion, up almost 450 per cent from September 2013. During six months, non-monetary gold imports were $14.65 billion.
According to Reserve Bank of India figures, the balance of payment (BoP) stood at a surplus of $6.9 billion during continued…

India the brightest spot in Asia Pacific region: Standard & PoorsBy: Press Trust of India | Washington |
Posted: December 9, 2014 1:22 pm
India has emerged as the brightest spot in the Asia Pacific region as reform has picked up pace in the country in recent months, a top credit rating agency has said.
“India has been the region’s brightest spot since our last report. After a modest beginning, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi’s government has picked up the pace of reform, eliminating the diesel subsidy in early November, liberalising foreign investment into the insurance sector, and curbing discretionary government spending for the second half of the current fiscal year,” the Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said.
Confidence has improved and growth momentum is now at around seven per cent, S&P said in its latest quarterly updates on credit conditions in North America, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and Europe.
In the Asia Pacific region, Australia’s GDP growth continues to trend at around three per cent, buoyed by reasonably solid consumption and still-strong real exports, despite falling iron ore prices, it said.
Banks and bond investors appear incrementally cautious and selective with their investments throughout the region.
“Our issuer ratings outlook eased slightly to a net negative bias of 11 per cent at the end of October, in line with receding concerns about India. However, the ratio remains high compared to other regions. Cyclical industries such as transportation, building materials, chemicals, real estate development, and capital goods have above-average negative biases,” the agency said.
Some Asia-Pacific economies, it said, are ending 2014 on a relatively lower note than expected, as China’s growth momentum slows under a weaker property market, Japan slips into recession, and external demand has yet to meaningfully improve.
Financial sector turbulence arising from China’s property sector could have effects beyond China.
While a stronger US recovery is export-positive, the concurrent higher hike in the Fed Funds rate could cause stress if not managed, it said.
“Against this backdrop, we see the credit cycle continuing to adjust to slower economic prospects, as well as high household and corporate debt in several countries weighing on some sectors’ credit outlooks,” it said.
The US economic recovery is strengthening, and Standard & Poor’s expects this trend to continue in the fourth quarter and through 2015, boosted by growing momentum in the labor and housing markets.

(Concerned over deteriorating…)
NEW DELHI: The civil aviation regulator today asked beleaguered SpiceJet to file a comprehensive by December 15 a convincing schedule and compliance of its directive disallowing the no-frill carrier to offer advance booking of air tickets beyond 30 days.
SpiceJet CEO Sanjeev Kapoor today met DGCA chief Prabhat Kumar as sought more time to file their reply, but the regulator asked him to file by December 15, official sources said.
Concerned over the deteriorating condition of SpiceJet and large-scale flight cancellations, aviation regulator DGCA had on Friday withdrawn 186 of its slots and asked it to clear salary dues of all its employees within the coming 10 days.
After reviewing the situation, Kumar took a series of decisions, including asking the airline to file a convincing schedule to clear its dues to various vendors, among them airports and oil companies.
In signs of mounting troubles for the budget airlines, cash-strapped SpiceJet has canceled over 1,800 flights across the country for the current month.

SBI launches home-grown index to track economic trendseconomic indicator
The country now has another monthly economic index, with State Bank of India on Tuesday launching a tool that will primarily track manufacturing activity to offer a forward-looking economic trends. The SBI Composite Index rivals the existing data point from British lender HSBC.
The SBI index has been developed on the basis of the bank’s internal loan portfolio, which mirrors the credit demand in the country, and other data sets available in public domain.
“The index will analyse data from manufacturing and services industries to determine expansion or contraction in the economy,” SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya told reporters here while announcing the product. The bank has created two indices — the SBI Monthly Composite Index and the SBI Yearly Composite Index. Both fulfil complementary purposes such as month-on-month sentiment movement and year-on-year growth forecast, respectively.
The index would also take into account other indicators of economic activities such as consumer spending, mining, interest rates, inflation and exchange rates on a monthly basis. The indices would be released every month post-RBI’s credit growth numbers, she said, adding the data collection would not be outsourced as was the case with the HSBC data.
Oommen A. Ninan adds:
Lending rates can be cut when credit picks up
Ms. Bhattacharya said a cut in lending rates were possible when “little bit more of pick up would take place in credit.”
She also said the Reserve Bank of India should signal the market with a deeper cut in policy rate for banks to reduce lending rates.

As oil subsidy falls  hurdles to sharing holds up payoutsWritten by Amitav Ranjan | New Delhi |
Posted: December 10, 2014 1:09 am | Updated: December 10, 2014 6:32 am
Subsidy burden on sale of LPG, diesel and kerosene has declined 20 per cent to Rs 82,844 crore in 2014-15 but the burden sharing mechanism is held up for more than a month because of finance ministry’s refusal to adjust the cess paid on crude oil by national oil companies (NOCs) to the exchequer as their share.
The petroleum ministry last month proposed that the subsidy burden incurred by downstream oil marketing companies (OMCs) on diesel until October 18 and on kerosene and LPG be shared equally between the government and upstream operators ONGC, OIL and GAIL India.
It also proposed that the oil industry development cess of Rs 10,500 crore paid by ONGC and OIL be considered a part of the latter’s burden share. But the finance ministry did not agree to it reiterating its July position that it could not cut the cess because the exchequer had borne a large part of the OMCs’ revenue loss in the past.
“The government has been bearing a substantial portion of the under recoveries of the OMCs and these non-plan expenditures need substantial assistance and in view of these, the cess on crude petroleum cannot be reduced further,” the department of expenditure said. However, last week the petroleum ministry cautioned the department of expenditure that if the cess of Rs 4,500 per tonne amounting to Rs 10,500 crore for 2014-15 was not adjusted, earnings from oil sales by ONGC and OIL would turn negative and jeopardise the finance ministry’s plan to sell 5 per cent in ONGC.
The oil ministry said that cess was to be deployed for the development of oil sector but only Rs 902.40 crore had been provided for this purpose out of the Rs 1,18,506.95 crore collected from 1974-75 to 2012-13. It said that since the cess collected was not being transferred for the intended purpose, there was a need to make the cess collected from ONGC and OIL as a part of the overall burden sharing mechanism.
At the start of the fiscal year, the subsidy burden or the revenue loss on sale of controlled products below market price was estimated at Rs 1,04,500 crore. Sources said the falling crude price has brought down kerosene subsidy to Rs 26,520 crore from last month’s Rs 28,382 crore while that on diesel stood fixed at Rs 10,821 crore as on October 18 when its price was decontrolled. This would be shared equally between the Centre and the NOCs.

Reliance Industries forms textiles JV with Chinas Shandong RuyiBy: ENS Economic Bureau | Mumbai |
Posted: December 10, 2014 1:19 am | Updated: December 10, 2014 6:32 am
Reliance Industries (RIL) has announced a joint venture with China’s Shandong Ruyi Science and Technology Group to “reposition its textile business on a high growth path”.
As part of the deal, Mukesh Ambani-run RIL will transfer its existing textile business into a newly incorporated company, for which RIL will receive cash consideration.
RIL will own a majority 51 per cent in the proposed JV, with the balance 49 per cent owned by Shandong Ruyi. The proposed transaction is subject to regulatory approvals.
However, RIL has not disclosed the cash consideration for the deal. “RIL’s existing textile business is the founding business of RIL and operates under the well-known brand ‘Vimal’. It has a prominent presence in the Indian textile market, especially in the worsted and synthetic suiting fabric segments,” RIL said in a statement.
The JV will build on RIL’s existing textile business and wide distribution network in India and Ruyi’s state-of-the-art technology and its global reach. The JV will benefit from the strength of the ‘Vimal’ and ‘Georgia Gullini’ brands and plans to introduce some of the well-known global brands of Ruyi. Qiu Yafu, chairman, Shandong Ruyi Group, said: “…we see our joint venture with Reliance as a significant event for the group. To enter the Indian market with Reliance we truly believe is the bright future of this joint venture business.”

Why banning taxi companies may not be a good ideaTweet
Drivers earn more, riders pay less... City commuting was never this convenient. Why the ban then?, ask users and investors.
Drivers earn more, riders pay less... City commuting was never this convenient. Why the ban then, ask users and investors.
1. DOES NOT MAKE CITIES SAFER FOR WOMEN
Services like Uber, Ola and TaxiForSure if mandated to have only police-verified drivers with photo-identity and GPS, can offer a safer service. "Is the govt ensuring my safety in an auto, bus, private taxi or walking? Banning these companies just makes my travel more unsafe. It's not the solution," said Shradha Patnaik (24), communications manager, Gurgaon.
2. SPOOKS INVESTORS
In 2014 alone, taxi aggregators including Ola and TaxiForSure raised funding of over $250 m (Rs 1,540 crore) from investors like SoftBank , Tiger Global, Accel US, Helion Partners, Sequoia. "Cab aggregation is one of the hottest investment areas. If irrational steps like banning companies are taken, investors will think twice before investing in any sector in India again," said an investor.
3. FARES HAVE DROPPED
Competition in taxi industry has led to a drop in fares. Ola has cut fares to Rs 2.50 per km for its mini range. At the same time, TaxiForSure reduced its base fare to Rs 49 to attract more customers. Meru cabs now charges Rs 10 per km for its low-cost segment
4. TAXI-AGGREGATION COMPANIES OFFER VEHICLE FINANCING AND MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF BUSINESS FOR DRIVERS
Thousands of drivers have taken loans to get on to the Ola, Uber or TaxiForSure platform and depend on business from the aggregators. "I have enrolled at least 10 people from my village to Ola and Uber platform. They all have five-year loans. No one is thinking of what will happen to them," said Nagaraj, a Bengaluru-based Uber driver.

Nitin Gadkari questions ban on Uber-like cabs1988 Motor Vehicles Act
(Union Road Transport Minister…)
NEW DELHI: The government, in a show of toughness, called for a nationwide ban on Uber and all unlicensed online taxi aggregator firms on Tuesday, but the move was overshadowed by voices of dissent from within the Union Cabinet and presented an unflattering spectacle of a divided administration.
As the home ministry led by Rajnath Singh took forward its tough line against San Francisco-based Uber, in the dock after one of its drivers was accused of raping a woman passenger last week, by sending an advisory to all state governments to emulate the Delhi government's action to ban all online taxi aggregators, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari openly questioned the wisdom of such a ban.
"It doesn't make sense to ban services. Tomorrow, if something happens on a bus, we can't ban that. Similarly, if something of this sort happens on a plane, that too cannot be banned," Gadkari was quoted as saying.
The minister suggested that a better approach was to plug systemic deficiencies to ensure that they remained in step with technological developments.
"New systems with modern concepts like these are being implemented in countries like the UK, the US and others, and we too must encourage it. The lacunae in such systems should be plugged," he said.
And he was not the only one advocating such an approach.Another powerful cabinet minister likened the ban to 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater' and said regulating such services was a better approach. "One should not throw the baby with the bathwater. The taxis have become popular as they arrive within 3-5 minutes and the payment of fare is easy for those who are enlisted with a taxi service as a client...We need to regulate these taxi services. Banning them may not be the right thing to do," the minister said. Their comments were the first bits of good news in days for Uber, which has been pilloried for failing to run adequate checks on drivers in its quest to expand in India. Elsewhere in the world, it suffered another setback after the government in Thailand ordered it to cease operations while in Indonesia and Vietnam, it came under greater scrutiny.
Meanwhile, as the two ministers spoke in differing voices, speculation arose if the home ministry had at all consulted the transport ministry, whose job is to administer the Motor Vehicles Act under which Uber and other similar taxi services have been banned, before issuing the advisory to all states. The opposition was quick to seize on the apparent divisions in the government.
"A union minister has said 'one cannot ban trains if there is rape in a train, one cannot ban buses if there is a rape in a bus', while the union government has banned Uber. Government must clarify. Your cabinet colleague has criticised the ban on Uber," the Congress party's deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, told the home minister. The Congress has opposed the ban.
Singh, on his part, responded that he hadn't heard the transport minister speak and would therefore not comment.
The home minister also said the government "was not in favour of banning taxi services" but wanted to regulate their operations so they were being prohibited till they seek the necessary licences .
"I want to say that our intentions should not be questioned in this regard," he said in the Rajya Sabha. Earlier, speaking in the upper house he said that his ministry had advised chief secretaries, home secretaries, transport secretaries and the police chiefs of all states through a communique to stop operations of Uber and urged the public not to hire any transport service provided by web-based taxi service providers like Uber until they obtained necessary licences or permissions from states.
The government's response to the crisis drew jeers on social media, with some taunting whether it would also ban the police or the transport authorities for failing to keep the alleged rapist, a repeat offender, off the roads.

BENGALURU: The Delhi administration's decision to ban Uber and other cab hailing services met with harsh criticism on social media. Madhu Kishwar@madhukishwar 4 hrs4 hours ago: Help police build capacity to effectively combat crimes incldg monitor taxis. Why ban Uber when others don't do better at compliance?
When the rape of a passenger by an Uber taxi driver came to light on Saturday, social media users raged against the taxi hailing company's 'reckless' expansion that led to lax security checks.
Tinu Cherian, head of digital media at a multinational corporation, who has over 150,000 followers on Twitter told ET that the way Uber handled the situation on social media after the news broke was not adequate. "From a social media point of view, Uber failed to address the snowballing reputation crisis," said Cherian.
He tweeted: "Uber suspended in Delhi halting 6,000+ jobs. Delhi Police DCP had issued character certificate to driver. By that logic Delhi Police must be banned."
Karthik Srinivasan , National Lead- Social, Ogilvy said: "Not actively engaging on social media, to questions being posed, may actually be a better strategy because the sheer number of questions that could come up may not be easy to handle at all."
In the first 24 hours, the issue got more than 15,000 mentions and started trending on Twitter. It was a hot topic on Facebook and various forums, shows a quick social media analysis by Simplify360 , a social media analytics company.
"Social media has escalated the issue to the highest level, now it's time for authorities to bring the real culprit forward and do justice," said Bhupendra Khanal, CEO of Simplify360. Many users termed the official response as "knee jerk reaction".

BJP banks on Modi to swing the tide in its favour in Kolkata's KMC elections

(Elections to KMC and 90 other…)
KOLKATA: The West Bengal unit of BJP has decided to hold a rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds in February that will be addressed by Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi , in its bid to wrest the Kolkata Municipal Corporation when polls are held in April. A senior BJP leader admitted in private that they were banking heavily on Modi to kick of the campaign and wrest KMC from the ruling Trinamool Congress. Elections to KMC and 90 other civic bodies are considered the biggest polls before the crucial assembly elections in 2016 and BJP is making all efforts to perform well in the civic polls.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has already announced that Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee would continue to run the civic body for the second consecutive term. But electors have no idea about BJP's mayoral candidate yet. BJP national secretary Sidharth Nath Singh told ET recently, "We are open about projecting someone as our mayoral candidate for KMC elections." State BJP leaders also said that they were planning to fight April's KMC polls by projecting someone as would-be mayor. But the party is yet to announce the name even though Banerjee has already declared Chatterjee as her party's candidate again.
BJP knows that the state election commission and law and order during polls would be under the control of the state police. BJP state president Rahul Sinha has already alerted party workers about this. "We may not get central forces during the civic elections. We know that the ruling party might get some benefit during civic elections. But we have full confidence in the people," Sinha told ET.
Apart from KMC, about 90 municpalities across the state will go for polls in April and none of these civic bodies are under BJP's control. Even in KMC, BJP has just three councillors out of 141 municipal wards.
Even though the party has claimed that more than 1 lakh Muslims have joined them, it might be hard for them to secure Muslim support in areas like Park Circus, Garden Reach, Rajabazar, Metiabruz that are Muslim-dominated under KMC. The defeat of BJP candidate Ritesh Tiwari in Chowringhee assembly byelections indicates that BJP is yet to establish political dominance in the city.

(Magotra alleged that PDP,…)
JAMMU: Calling it a game changer, BJP today said that "massive" response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Kashmir was an indication of the acceptance of the party by the people of the state.
"The massive participation of the Kashmiri people in PM Narendra Modi's rally at Srinagar has very clearly reflected the acceptance of BJP across the entire length and breadth of the Valley, in tune with Ladakh and Jammu," BJP State Spokesperson Suresh Ajay Magotra told reporters here.
He claimed that the record gathering at Modi's rally also suggested that the people of Kashmir have rejected the "misrule, corruption, nepotism and cronyism" of successive governments of Peoples Democratic Party , National Conference and Congress.
"Modi's rally in Kashmir is a game changer," he said. "The Valley people, particularly those who were affected by the floods, have high praise for Narendra Modi-led dispensation for quick, decisive action and understanding the gravity of the post-floods situation in comparison to the state government, which was not visible for many days," he added.
Magotra said, "Political scenario in the state is going to change after this election as people are fed up with hallow promises of the successive governments and their blackmailing tactics to squeeze more and more funds from the Centre and squandering it."
He alleged that PDP, NC and Congress have been befooling the masses of Kashmir by different emotional sloganeering for political power.
"The PM's message at his rally was development, peace, equitable growth, employment for all the three regions and for every one," he added.
Magotra expressed hope that the overwhelming participation of the people in the rally will further culminate into their casting of votes in favour of BJP candidates.

(The state government spends…)
JALANDHAR: BJP today hit out at the Punjab government led by its ally SAD , alleging that while the state ignored the martyrdom of soldiers, it "wasted precious money" on performances by film actors.
Senior BJP leader and former cabinet minister in the Punjab government Laxmi Kanta Chawla said three jawans belonging to Punjab were killed in militant attacks in Jammu and Kashmir .
"They were cremated with full state honours but the state government doesn't seem to be saddened by the incident," she said.
Chawla alleged while the state government spends crores of rupees on performances by film stars, it hesitates to give even a few lakhs to the martyrs' families.
The BJP leader was referring to the inaugural ceremony of 5th Kabaddi World Cup here on December 6, in which actors Sonakshi Sinha and Arjun Kapoor performed. Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal were present on the occasion.

Max India  RCap rise on panel nod to 49% FDI limitMax India, RCap stocks rise on parliamentary panel nod to 49% FDI limit in insurance

The Max India stock rose on Wedenesday on reports that a Parliamentary committee has recommended a composite cap of 49 per cent on foreign investment in insurance in a report tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.
At 12:29 pm, the Max India stock rose 6.25 per cent. The stock closed 5.34 per cent higher.
Other stocks related to the insurance sector such as Reliance Capital and Aditya Birla Nuvo rose 4.34 per cent and 0.71 per cent, respectively.
The select committee report said that the cap on foreign investment in insurance include foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investments.
After getting a favourable recommendation from the panel that includes members from all major political parties, the government is likely to bring the Bill for consideration of the Upper House as early as next week.
The Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008, proposes to increase FDI limit in the insurance sector to 49% from the existing 26%.

Cyber attack could cost Sony $100 millionCyber attack could cost Sony studio as much as $100 million
Lisa Richwine     Los Angeles   Last Updated: December 10, 2014  | 13:13 IST

Sony's movie studio could face $100 million in costs from the massive computer hack that hobbled its operations and exposed sensitive data, according to cyber security experts who have studied past breaches.
The tab will be less than the $171 million Sony estimated for the breach of its Playstation Network in 2011 because it does not appear to involve customer data, the experts said.
Major costs for the attack by unidentified hackers include the investigation into what happened, computer repair or replacement, and steps to prevent a future attack. Lost productivity while operations were disrupted will add to the price tag.
"The attack, believed to be the worst of its type on a company on US soil, also hits Sony's reputation for a perceived failure to safeguard information", said Jim Lewis, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"Usually, people get over it, but it does have a short-term effect," said Lewis, who estimated costs for Sony could stretch to $100 million.
It typically takes at least six months after a breach to determine the full financial impact, Lewis said.
Sony has declined to estimate costs, saying it was still assessing the impact.
The company has insurance to cover data breaches, a person familiar with the matter said. Cybersecurity insurance typically reimburses only a portion of costs from hacking incidents, experts said.
People claiming responsibility for the attack posted yet-to-be-released Sony films online, including holiday musical "Annie." Macquarie Research analysts projected Sony would likely take an impairment charge of 10 billion yen ($83 million) related to the incident.
Mark Rasch, a former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, estimated costs could run up to $70 million.
Losses in that range would not mean a big financial setback to Sony Pictures Entertainment , which reported operating profit of $501 million for the fiscal year through March.
But other effects, such as the loss of trade secrets, will be difficult to measure, Rasch said. Hackers have released a trove of documents that include contracts and marketing plans that could influence competitors' strategies.
Costs could mount if Hollywood stars, producers or financiers decide to take projects to Sony's competitors.
"Will they be able to attract high-name stars if those stars believe their personal information will not be protected? "How do you know what business opportunities are lost? It's hard to put a dollar figure on it", he said.

Sensex snaps three-day fall  ends 34 points upMarket update: Sensex snaps three-session falling trend, rises 34 points

(Photo: Reuters)
The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex on Wednesday recovered from over one-month lows, snapping a three-day fall, by rising 34.09 points to end at 27,831.10.
The BSE index was helped by gains in bluechips, including State Bank of India (SBI), Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Tata Power, on value-buying and positive cues from European markets.
In volatile movements, the 30-share BSE barometer resumed lower and slipped further to hit an intra-day low of 27,710.03 as investors grappled with effects of tougher Chinese rules on lending and political instability concerns in Greece.
However, emergence of buying in afternoon trade helped the gauge wipe off initial losses to close higher at 27,831.10, logging a rise of 34.09 points, or 0.12 per cent. The Sensex had lost 765.81 points in the previous three sessions.
Among the 30 Sensex scrips, 13 constituents led by SBI, ONGC, Tata Power, Tata Motors, Cipla, Dr Reddy, Hero MotoCorp, Sesa Sterlite, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, NTPC, ITC Ltd and Axis Bank closed higher, helping Sensex to end in the green.
Fall in BHEL, GAIL, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Steel, Bajaj Auto, Wipro, L&T, RIL, TCS, Coal India, HDFC, Hindalco, M&M and Maruti Suzuki shares, however, weighed.
Shares of Bharti Airtel , which gained over 2 per cent in early trade after telecom tribunal TDSAT set aside Rs 650 crore penalty imposed by the Department of Telecom (DoT), succumbed to profit-booking towards market closing hours and ended 0.16 per cent down.
The broader 50-share National Stock exchange (NSE) index Nifty also recovered by 14.95 points (or 0.18 per cent), to end above the 8,350-mark at 8,355.65.
Second-line shares were also back in form on a fresh spell of buying support from retail investors.
Shares of jewellery makers surged on speculation that the government may announce changes to gold-import rules for trading houses.
Gitanjali Gems stock surged 8.53 per cent, followed by TBZ (4.46 per cent), PC Jewellers (2.31 per cent) and Titan (3.99 per cent).
The BSE Mid-cap and BSE Small-cap indices closed higher by 0.93 per cent and 1.06 per cent respectively.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 221.52 crore on Tuesday as per provisional data.

Its hug of love now against moral policingIt’s ‘hug of love’ now against moral policing
KPM Basheer
The students’ objective was to defend the democratic right to hug or kiss and prevent the increasing incidents of moral policing
CPI(M) condemns ‘assault’ on young people by police
Kochi, December 10:  
After ‘kiss of love’ it’s the ‘hug of love’ in Kerala. Three days after Shiv Sena and Hanuman Sena activists aborted the December 7 ‘kiss of love’ protest in Kozhikode against moral policing and unleashed violence against the protesters, a group of law students staged a ‘hug of love’ in the city.
On Wednesday, the International Human Rights Day, male and female students at Kozhikode Law College staged a protest by hugging one another in front of the college. Their objective, the students claimed, was to defend the democratic right to hug or kiss and to prevent the increasing incidents of moral policing by right-wing outfits claiming to defend the country’s traditions and values.
The December 7 attacks, unleashed in an organized way by the newly surfaced Shiv Sena and Hanuman Sena outfits, had turned parts of Kozhikode into a riot-like zone for a couple of hours.
Several people were injured and about 100 persons, most of them activists of the Facebook collective ‘Kiss of Love,’ were arrested. The Sena activists, beat up groups of protesters who were forced to flee. The well-known screenwriter Didi Damodaran and her husband Premchand were among those injured. The Sena activists had pounced on the couple while kissing; the couple had to be rescued by the police.
Earlier protests
On November 2, the police and Shiv Sena had foiled a much-publicised ‘kiss of love’ protest in Kochi. This grabbed media attention across the country and the police drew flak for indirectly helping the right-wing interests of the Sena. The ‘kissing protest’ was triggered by the attack on a Kozhikode cafe by a group of Sangh Parivar activists nearly two months ago for allegedly allowing a young couple to kiss at the cafe. There was wide protest against the attack which was dubbed as an attempt at moral policing. The Shiv Sena has announced that it will continue to oppose the ‘kiss of love’ protest. It claimed that kissing in public would promote sexual anarchy and erosion of moral values.
The Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s Kozhikode district committee condemned the ‘brutal assault by the Sangh Parivar and police’ on young people. However, CPI(M) State secretary Pinarayi Vijayan said the ‘kissing protest’ did not gel with Kerala’s cultural traditions. He called for a wider, mass protest against moral policing by employing peaceful means. The kissing protests have generated a hot debate in Kerala about conservative social and moral outlooks in modern lifestyles.

Infosys Founders Fully Committed to Management: CEO SikkaTata Motors Sales Rise 10% in December
New Delhi: Infosys chief executive Vishal Sikka on Wednesday said the founders of India's second largest IT services firm still remain committed to the firm and the stocks sold recently will be used for philanthropic purposes.
Earlier this week, co-founders N R Narayana Murthy and Nandan Nilekani along with their family members sold Infosys shares worth Rs 6,484 crore.
Following the sale, shares of the Bangalore-based firm fell nearly 5 per cent, wiping out Rs 11,611 crore from its market valuation.
"It was long overdue, I think it was part of a portfolio decision. The vast majority of their holdings are still there, and they are still among the largest shareholders of the company," Mr Sikka, the first non-founder and outsider to lead Infosys, said in an interview to a TV channel.
The sale included 32.6 million shares of Infosys.
"They are fully committed to the management, to the company - it's all good," Mr Sikka further said.
Infosys shares, on Wednesday, closed marginally lower at Rs 1,963.70 from the previous close on the BSE.
The sale was been done to partially monetize their stake, after more than three decades of setting up the company. Some portion of the proceeds will also be used by the founders towards philanthropic activities.
"One key thing that people don't know about Infosys is the massive influence that Infosys has with regard towards philanthropy. Infosys Foundation, still headed by Mrs Murthy, wife our founder. It's a huge activity for us. It (the sale) was part of philanthropic, giving, entrepreneurship. This was the reason for the sale," he said.
Mr Murthy and his family sold 12 million shares (23.3 per cent of their holding), Mr Nilekani and family sold 12 million (31.3 per cent of their holding), K Dinesh and family 6.2 million (21.5 per cent of their holding), and Kumari Shibulal 2.4 million (9.6 per cent of their holding).

Workforce Optimisation on at TCS  Hiring Plans Still on TrackTata Motors Sales Rise 10% in December
New Delhi: IT giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is believed to be undertaking a significant performance-related restructuring of its workforce, which may also lead to some employees being asked to leave the company.
Sources said that the restructuring exercise could affect both onsite and offsite positions across various verticals, even as the company said it is on track to meet hiring target of 55,000 professionals this fiscal year.
Most affected by the restructuring drive could be middle to senior-level positions, sources said, while adding that some employees may be offered positions at vendors working with TCS.
The country's largest software exporter with over $13-billion annual turnover employs over 3 lakh people across 46 countries.
When contacted, a TCS spokesperson said, "As a performance-driven company, workforce optimisation is a continuous process which happens throughout the year taking into account employee performance, business needs, and people aspirations."
"This leads to some amount of involuntary attrition in the company. This is nothing out of the ordinary or a special situation for us to comment about," the spokesperson further said.
"We continue to be leading recruiters of IT talent across the world, not only in India. In this fiscal year, we have a total hiring target of 55,000 professionals and we are on track to meet it."
At the end of last quarter ended September 30, 2014, TCS had a total headcount of 3,13,757 following a gross employee addition of over 20,000 people.
Headcount utilisation during the quarter stood at 86.2 per cent, excluding trainees, while the figure after including trainees was at 81.3 per cent.
Net addition stood at 8,326 employees during the quarter, while its attrition rate was 12.8 per cent.
During the July-September quarter, TCS also crossed a milestone of employing one lakh women professionals with a gender diversity ratio of 32.9 per cent.
The company's net profit declined by 5.8 per cent to Rs 5,244 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, while revenue rose by 7.7 per cent to Rs 23,816 crore.

New Delhi: The leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha will be included in a panel to select the chairperson and members of Lokpal under the amended law, governing the functioning of the anti-corruption body, approved by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday.
The approved amendments in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act paves the way for the inclusion of Congress party leader Mallikarjun Kharge in the selection panel led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
"The Act, as now proposed to be amended, seeks to remove the deficiencies and provide for the alternative of Leader of single largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha in the event there is no Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, for being represented on the selection committee for appointments of chairperson and members of Lokpal," an official release said.
Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has not given LoP status to Congress which failed to secure 55 seats in the Lok Sabha.
#lok sabha #congress #cabinet #lokpal
As per the Lokpal Act, the selection committee consists of the Lok Sabha Speaker, the Leader of Opposition in the Lower House, the Chief Justice of India or a judge of the apex court nominated by him and an eminent jurist who could be nominated by the President or any other member.
Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has not given LoP status to Congress which failed to secure 55 seats in the Lok Sabha. Congress with 44 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha has emerged as the second largest party after BJP's 282 but fell short by 11 to stake claim to the Leader of Opposition (LoP) post for which it requires a strength of 55.
The Cabinet also approved amendments for providing for qualifications for appointment of Director of Prosecution in CBI and for his functional independence, it said.
"The proposed amendments will also address other deficiencies in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013," the release said.
A Bill effecting these amendments will be brought during the ongoing winter session of Parliament, it said.
The amendments also seek to synchronize the provisions of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act with the existing regulating Acts, rules and regulations in respect of declaration of assets and liabilities by various categories of public servants and establish appropriate mechanisms to obtain and publish such information received from public servants for the benefit of the public, the release said.
The proposed amendments will address some crucial deficiencies noticed in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act and the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, which governs the working of CBI, it said.

45 million in U.S. to take to the skies during winter holidays
Some 45 million passengers are expected to fly during the winter holidays, up 2 percent from last year, with Dec. 19 (a Friday), expected to be the heaviest travel day at American airports, according to a forecast released Wednesday by airline industry group Airlines for America.

Because of how holidays fall this year, the group considered the winter holidays to be the 19 days from Dec. 17 to Jan. 4.
As usual, the lightest air travel days will be Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.

Chicago O'Hare airport is expected to be the third-busiest airport after Atlanta and Los Angeles.
To accommodate demand, airlines have been adding seats at the fastest clip since the 2008 recession, mostly by using larger aircraft, which during the holiday period are expected to be 80 to 90 percent full, the airline group said.
John Heimlich, chief economist for Airlines for America, said airlines are upgrading their airplanes and airports at a spending rate that's the highest in 13 years.

New Delhi: Trouble is escalating for Uber as the accused driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, who is in police custody will be produced in court on Thursday. He allegedly raped a 25-year-old MNC employee on December 5 night.
Meanwhile, the company's Asia Pacific head was grilled by the Delhi Police on Wednesday. He was asked to furnish documents on employee verification, the company's database, and documents pertaining to employees they hire.
A petition was filed in the Delhi High Court over Uber not having a grievance officer, which is mandatory for all cab companies.

The police also recovered the iPhone that was given to the accused driver by Uber. Delhi Police has filed an FIR against Uber for cheating and not following government orders.
Usha Mehra Panel chief Justice Usha Mehra, however, said none of the guidlines given by the panel have been implemented by the government. The panel was set up after horrific December 16 Delhi gangrape to identify lapses and fix responsibility.
Mehra said, "Nothing has changed since Nirbhaya case. The government hasn't followed any of our recommendations. Uber and transport department are equally responsible. The co-ordination between traffic police, transport department is still lacking."

Windows 10: Microsoft s next version of Windows OS likely to be released in September 201536
1
Seattle: Microsoft expects to have its new Windows 10 operating system on the market by autumn 2015, slightly later than previous comments had suggested.
Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner told Japanese news service Nikkei on Wednesday that the new system would be released "early next fall."
Microsoft has not publicly set a firm timetable for the release of Windows 10, but only last week suggested the possibility of an earlier release.
An early test version of Windows 10  has been available for download from Microsoft's website for more than two months.
#microsoft #windows 10 #windows 10 release
"By next late summer and early fall we'll be able to bring out this particular OS (operating system). That's the current plan of record," Turner told the Credit Suisse Technology Conference last Thursday.
An autumn release would put Windows 10 on track for launch three years after Windows 8, which got a mixed reception as it confused many traditional PC users with a design more suited to tablets.
Microsoft unveiled the name Windows 10 in late September, saying the jump in numbers from 8 to 10 marked a leap as it looks to unify the way people work on tablets, phones and traditional computers.
An early test version of Windows 10 - which blends the traditional look and much-loved start menu with newer features - has been available for download from Microsoft's website for more than two months.
Windows is still a core part of Microsoft's business and dominates the desktop computing market with 1.5 billion users. But the growth of smartphones and tablets means Windows now runs on only about 14 percent of computing devices worldwide, according to tech research firm Gartner.

Delhi High Court stops sale of Xiaomi phones on FlipkartTata Motors sales up 10 pct in December
The Delhi High Court in an interim order has restrained Xiaomi as well as online e-commerce site Flipkart from selling in India handsets of the Chinese mobile maker that run on the technology patented by Ericsson.
The court has also restrained Xiaomi or its agents from making, assembling, importing or offering for sale its devices which are infringing the mobile phone technology patented by Ericsson.
Justice G P Mittal directed the customs authorities to prevent import of Xiaomi phones that are infringing the patents of Ericsson and if any consignment is imported, the same be informed to Ericsson and its objections be decided as per the Intellectual Property Rules.
“I am satisfied that plaintiff (Ericsson) has made out a prima facie case for grant of ad interim injunction in its favour. The balance of convenience also lies in favour of plaintiff and in the absence of an injunction order, plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and injury,” the court said.
It also issued summons and notice to Xiaomi and Flipkart and directed them to file an affidavit disclosing the number of devices – that are AMR, EDGE and 3G compliant – sold by them in India till date.
They have to also indicate in the affidavit the revenue earned by selling these devices till date.
The court has also appointed three local commissioners to visit the premises of Xiaomi and Flipkart where the devices are stored in order to inspect and collect documents as well as seal the infringing mobiles.
The total fees of the local commissioners, amounting to Rs 3.5 lakh shall be borne by Ericsson apart from travel and stay expenses, it said.
The local commissioners have to submit their report within four weeks, it also said.
The order was passed on the plea of Ericsson that Xiaomi has been violating its eight patents pertaining to AMR, EDGE and 3G technologies in the field of telecommunication.
Ericsson has said that it had invited Xiaomi to use its patented technology by obtaining a licence, but instead of doing so, the Chinese manufacturer launched its devices in India in July 2014.

Google s online shopping fest brings big gain for price comparison  coupons portalsPrice-comparison, coupons portals gain from Google's fest
Itika Sharma Punit | Bangalore Dec 12, 2014 12:45 AM IST
With about 450 brands and websites offering discounts as part of Google’s three-day Great Online Shopping Festival (GOSF) in India, buyers are taking to price-comparison, coupons and cashback websites in great numbers to avoid the tiring task of visiting each e-commerce portal to find the best deals.
A price-comparison website, also called shopping agent, shopbot or comparison shopping engine, is a search engine that filters and compares products being offered on several e-commerce portals, on the basis of price, features and other criteria.
A coupon website provides coupons that can help customers get additional price reduction on discounted rates. A cashback website is a type of reward portal that pays members a percentage of money earned when they purchase goods and services through its affiliate links.
DesiDime.com, which provides both price comparison service and coupons, saw an increase of three times in its unique visitors during the first day of GOSF on Wednesday.
Coupons and cashback website CashKaro.com, which works with over 500 online retailers, said it registered a 400 per cent rise in traffic, and its revenue rose 350 per cent, on Wednesday. The website’s average order value also rose — from Rs 2,000 on a usual day to Rs 3,500.
ALSO READ:  Google's online shopping festival attracts buyers in big numbers
Gadget price-comparison portal 91mobiles saw a rise of around 20 per cent in traffic a couple of days before GOSF, as retailers rolled out teaser deals ahead of the event. During GOSF, the portal expects to get around 300,000 visitors a day — about 40 per cent more than its daily average.
“Among the several thousand deals and offers available, it is difficult for a customer to locate the best one on a particular product, say a phone he might be looking to buy,” said Nitin Mathur, co-founder of 91mobiles.com.
Another cashback and coupons website, Pennyful.in, is hoping to see an increase of four times in the number of transactions per day during GOSF, compared with its regular-day average. “We expect our revenue to increase three folds and the average ticket size to double,” said Ravitej Yadalam, chief executive & founder of Pennyful.in. “During the event, we also expect to see 30 per cent growth in new customers transacting on the site for the first time.”

No takers in India for BPCL s Mozambique gas supplyMozambique gas may not come to India
Kalpana Pathak | Mumbai Dec 12, 2014 12:30 AM IST
Much-awaited gas from Mozambique’s Rovuma basin may not make it to Indian shores. Bharat Petro Resources Limited (BPRL), the upstream arm of the state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation, and its consortium partners have tied up two-thirds of the gas with customers in Asia. But so far, no Indian company, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) executives said, had come on board to secure gas supplies from the consortium.
This September, at BPCL’s annual general meeting, S Varadarajan, the company’s chairman and managing director, had said, “Members of the consortium have tied up two-thirds of the gas with customers in Japan, China and Thailand, and are in talks with Indian companies, too.” BPRL and its consortium partners have been in discussions for marketing natural gas from their flagship international asset, the Rovuma basin in Mozambique.
“The operator had in 2012 formed marketing teams to talk to companies in Japan, China and Thailand. These countries are ready to pay more for gas. Besides, we need to maximise our revenue as we plan to set up two LNG (liquefied natural gas) trains,” said a senior BPRL executive. BPCL did not reply to an email questionnaire.  Natural gas reserves in the Mozambique block have been estimated at 50-70 trillion cubic feet (tcf) by its operator Anadarko. This is almost 10 times the reserves of Reliance Industries’ D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin.
BPRL partners the Mozambique block with consortium members Anadarko Mocambique Area 1 Limitada (26.5 per cent), BPRL Ventures Mozambique (10 per cent), Beas Rovuma Energy Mozambique (10 per cent), ONGC Videsh Ltd (10 per cent), Cove Energy Mozambique Rovuma Offshore (8.5 per cent), Mitsui E&P Mozambique Area 1 Ltd (20 per cent) and Empressa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos EP (15 per cent). The consortium plans to set up two LNG trains of five million tonnes each with a provision for expansion in the future. The consortium will have to enter into long-term contracts with buyers to raise funds to finance the project and help put up the first two trains. Production from the fields will begin in 2019.
The LNG trains will initially require around $18-20 billion, of which $14 billion will be raised in loans.
“The rest will be brought in by the consortium members. Further investments will be from revenue the project brings in,” the executive added.
BPRL plans to invest Rs 12,000 crore in energy exploration and production in Mozambique and Brazil over the next four years.
BPCL’s share of reserves is five to seven tcf, equivalent to the size of the D6 block in India. BPRL will be investing up to Rs 10,000 crore as part of its share towards a 10 million tonne LNG terminal project in Mozambique.
BPRL had, in September, said it had been trying to put in place a mechanism through which BPCL’s balance sheet can be relieved. Based on the discoveries, the company has SBLC (standby letter of credit) range of $2 billion and with that, it has taken foreign currency loans of $900-950 million for the Mozambique asset.
BPRL plans to invest Rs 12,000 crore in energy exploration and production in Mozambique and Brazil over the next four years — its biggest investment in the so-called upstream sector.
“As far as upstream is concerned, we have spent about $1.3 billion. Of this, $680 million has gone into exploration in the Brazil block and $480 million for operations in Mozambique,” said D Raj Kumar, adding that "We are talking to the Mozambique government to see that we have a stable legal, fiscal and contractual regime in place. This stability will mean the operations will be insulated from any change in taxes, rules or regulations."
“These two assets (Brazil and Mozambique) are where the major chunk of investments are planned in the coming few years,”  Rajkumar had said in September after BPCL's annual general meeting. BPRL is present in seven countries, including India.
BPRL owns a 20 per cent stake in the Brazil block through an equal joint venture with Videocon Industries. Petrobras SA, the national oil company of Brazil, is the operator of the block and holds the remaining 60 per cent.

Built as a tribute to Delhi gangrape braveheart, Nirbheek revolver gives confidence to women

New Delhi: 'Diamonds are a woman's best friend' has been an age-old saying, but have the women found a new friend? 'Yes', says Seema Kharbanda who was among the first few women who bought the Nirbheek revolver to ensure their safety.
Launched a year after the brutal gangrape of 23-year-old paramedic student 'Nirbhaya' in Delhi, Nirbheek is a .32 bore titanium alloy-based revolver which was built as a tribute to the braveheart.
"I feel safe having the revolver with me. It is like an ornament much better than some jewellery for me. While it's scary to carry a piece of jewellery as you might be robbed, carrying a revolver makes you feel confident. When women can spend so much on jewellery, this should also be treated as important and bought as well," Seema said.
Nirbheek is a .32 bore titanium alloy-based revolver which has become very popular among women.
#delhi rape #delhi gangrape #woman #nirbheek
Seema Kharbanda, a resident of Delhi, along with Geeta Yadav from Lucknow and Kalpana Pandey from Barabanki were among the first few women who bought the revolver which is manufactured by the Indian Ordnance Factory and was launched in Kanpur in January 2014, almost a year after the brutal Delhi gangrape.
Lucknow's Geeta Yadav also said that she is happy to own the gun and treats it like a prized possession whenever she goes out, especially when alone. "It is easy to use. You also feel strong psychologically when you have the gun. Women should buy it for self defence," she said.
An easy to use revolver, Nirbheek costs Rs 1,40,646 and has a range of approximately 15 metres. "Since the time of its launch, we have sold nearly 300 pieces and we have orders for 350-400 more guns as of now," Joint General Manager Indian Ordnance Factory in Kanpur, DN Verma said.
Verma added that the revolver was manufactured specifically keeping the needs of women in mind. "It weighs 500 grams and is small and handy enough to be kept in a purse," he said.
While there is appreciation for the revolver, questions have also been raised over its high price which makes it a little difficult to own for the common woman. "We are aware that it is high priced but there is not much we can do about it. The production cost comes around Rs 93,000 for us but excise and other duties raise the price to more than Rs 1,40,000," Verma said.
However, he added that there are plans to give out special discounts for women applicants along with plans to launch a cheaper version of the gun which is more affordable. "Special discounts can convince more women applicants to buy the gun for their safety. We are also planning to launch another Mark III revolver which would cost around Rs 85,000-87,000. Though the cost of manufacturing it would be close to Rs 63,000, it would again be the taxes which would raise the prices," he said adding that they are planning to send out a proposal to the government to limit the taxes.
As a revolver shot can be fatal, Verma said that a thorough security check on the applicants is done before handing out the gun. "We send the applications to the licence issuing authority for thorough investigation. But if the confirmation from their side is not given in 30 days, we consider that there is no objection and we process the order. However, we wait for the confirmation report in case of highly sensitive areas like Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand," he added.
According to the women, the revolver ensures their safety and can be kept loaded very quickly for immediate use. As soon as the trigger is pressed, the first chamber turns and the second chamber which has the bullet gets ready for use. The first chamber is kept vacant while loading the gun as a safety measure in case the trigger is pressed by mistake.
The chamber can carry six bullets which can be fired continuously as well as one at a time. Using the gun does not require any special training except for the regular instructions that are given by the Kanpur based factory at the time when it is handed over.
The gangrape of the 23-year-old in 2012 had shocked the country and sent shivers down the spine of one and all. The brutality of the incident also grabbed the attention of the people across all quarters bringing the impertinent reality of an unsafe society for women to the fore.
While the incident had sparked off massive protests, it had also raised questions on the need to empower women in the society to fight such untoward events.

ED questions Maran brothers in Aircel-Maxis laundering caseED questions Maran brothers in Aircel-Maxis laundering case
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Dec 11:  
Taking forward the money laundering probe in the Aircel-Maxis deal, the Enforcement Directorate has questioned the Maran brothers— Dayanidhi and Kalanithi — in connection with its criminal case against them.
Sources said the investigators, early this week, recorded the statements of Dayanidhi, the former Telecom Minister, and his businessman brother Kalanithi here after they were issued notices in October this year.
“Both the Marans have been questioned and their statements recorded under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. They could be summoned again,” sources said.
The duo were questioned about their personal and official financial dealings and on specific charges related to the deal.
Some documents submitted by them are being scrutinised, they said.
Officials said the fresh questioning of the Marans was essential as the ED is expected to issue an attachment order for seizing of assets of an estimated value of over Rs 700 crore in this case and all questions regarding criminal actions had to be answered by those involved and booked, they said.
Other executives involved in the deal are also now being questioned, they said.
The ED is probing the case based on a CBI FIR in the matter.
Besides the Maran brothers, the CBI has named Malaysian business tycoon T Ananda Krishnan, Malaysian national Augustus Ralph Marshall and four firms — Sun Direct TV, Maxis Communication Berhad, Astro All Asia Network and South Asia Entertainment Holding — as accused.
The CBI has charged them with the offences punishable under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
The CBI had alleged in the court that Dayanidhi Maran had “pressured” and “forced” Chennai-based telecom promoter C. Sivasankaran to sell his stakes in Aircel and two subsidiary firms to Malaysian firm Maxis Group in 2006.
The ED’s money laundering case is based on this.

Minor Bangladeshi girl  a sex racket victim  to leave for home after 7-month ordealWritten by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram |
Posted: December 11, 2014 11:36 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 11:42 am
A minor girl from Bangladesh, who fell victim to a sex racket in Bangalore and jailed in Kerala where she was abandoned by the racket, would finally leave for home after seven months of ordeal. The 15-year-old girl is seven-month pregnant.
The district juvenile justice board in Kozhikode on Wednesday ordered that the girl should be immediately send back to Bangladesh. The board has entrusted the district collector to take necessary steps to ensure her safe return. He has a story of callous injustice to tell.
A native of Sathrapur in Bangladesh, the girl went missing from her home early May, this year. She reached in Kolkata, from where she moved to Bangalore in search of some job. On reaching Bangalore, she fell into the trap of sex racket. From Bangalore, she was handed over to a similar racket in Kozhikode district, where she was allegedly subjected to gang rape. A few days later, she was abandoned by the gang, which forced her to board a bus to Bangalore.
En route Bangalore, she got down at Thamarassery to get some food. That was on May 12. On that evening, police took her into custody and arrested for violating relevant sections under passport act as she was a foreigner without proper documents.
Thamarassery police mistakenly marked her age as 20. She was taken to local magistrate court, which remanded her in judicial custody. The minor girl, mistaken as an adult woman, was lodged in the district jail.
With the help of some NGOs, the jail authorities got in touch with some social organizations in Bangladesh and got her birth certificates, which substantiated that she is a minor. Last week, the girl was shifted to the juvenile home. The magistrate court also admitted that the girl was a minor and handed over the case to the juvenile justice board.
According to advocate Swapna Parameshwarath, an activist of Punarjani Trust which has been fighting for the cause of the girl, the mistake committed by the police proved costly for the girl. Although we had brought the issue to the notice of the police and the prosecution, nothing was done to deliver justice to the girl.’’
On Wednesday, the district juvenile justice board decided that the girl should be released from the home and send back to her home without any delay considering that she is pregnant. The board would also inform the magistrate court at Thamarassery, which had earlier remanded the girl in judicial custody.
Board decided that her seven month jail term should be considered as the punishment for staying without valid documents.
District collector C A Latha said the girl would be send back to her home without any delay. Since she is seven-month pregnant, a safe journey would be ensured with the help of social welfare department.

Delhi is less than six months away from getting a prospective world heritage city tag, government to ensure all goes well in scrutiny process.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Delhi is less than six months away from getting a prospective world heritage city tag, and the government is now trying to ensure that all goes well in the scrutiny process by international agencies UNESCO and ICOMOS .
A three-tier management and protection system announced by the government is being closely monitored by lieutenant general Najeeb Jung and chief secretary D M Spolia in which all existing and proposed projects pertaining to the nominated areas of Lutyens' Bungalow Zone and Shahjahanabad are being closely monitored. Three meetings were held last month with stakeholders like DDA, PWD and MCD.
The Delhi chapter of the consultant, Intach, which prepared the nomination dossiers, is manning the third level wherein a dedicated staff of conservationists, architects and planners have been especially asked to help with the planning process as part of an MoU with Delhi Tourism. This level includes projects like streetscaping, garbage clean-up, repair of roads, installing signages etc at Lutyens Bunglow zone and Shahjanabad. These projects are yet to be implemented. It also includes monitoring projects and reporting the same to the upper two levels as well as spreading awareness on heritage through outreach programmes, lectures and walks. Intach is bringing in staff specifically for this purpose. The level will work as "the eyes and ears of civil society".
The second protection level, which is the stakeholders' committee, will involve all agencies like PWD, MCD, DDA and Delhi Police who will work together to ensure that all works are implemented in the prescribed time.
At the highest management level, the chief secretary will regularly monitor and get updates on development in the nominated zones.
"World heritage city nomination is a long-term commitment. We have put a system in place for managing these heritage zones and ensure regular maintenance of the imperial cities of Delhi. Regular monitoring of these zones is also something closely followed by UNESCO,'' an official said.

Russia will remain India’s foremost defence partner, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday while announcing that Russia had accepted India’s offer to jointly manufacture light-utility helicopters.
India and Russia announced a $10-billion oil deal for Indian company Essar with Russian oil giant ROSNEFT to import about 10 million tonnes of crude oil over the next decade. The two sides also signed seven agreements on atomic energy, military training and health while Mr Modi and President Putin oversaw the signing of 13 commercial contracts.
Though no new defence deals were signed, Mr Modi said “Russia will remain our most important defence partner.” The comment came after months of speculation over a strain in India-Russia defence ties, heightened by Russia’s defence agreement with Pakistan and India diversifying its weapons and aircraft purchases, even though Russia still accounts for 70% of India’s defence inventory.

12 new reactors
The highlight of the meeting — part of an annual summit between the two countries — was the unveiling of a vision statement on atomic energy cooperation, where Russian nuclear agency ROSATOM and the Department of Atomic Energy and NPCIL have agreed to build at least 12 new reactors supplied by Russia over the next 20 years.
According to officials, 10 of the reactors will be built near the existing Kudankulam nuclear power project, while the Indian government is yet to notify the location for two others.
The bond between the people of Russia & India is very strong. Our nations have stood by each other through thick and thin: PM @narendramodi

Mr. Modi said: “Russia is the world’s top source for hydrocarbon resources and India one of the world’s largest importers. Despite our close friendship, our collaboration in this sector has been disappointing.” Both sides agreed to “scout and explore” for hydrocarbons in the “arctic shelf,” which could raise eyebrows from other countries in the region as well as environmentalists.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin confirmed that Russia plans to assemble about 400 Kamov Ka-226 T twin-engined Russian helicopters in India. “I am pleased that Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters. It includes the possibility of exports from India. It can be used for both military and civilian use,” Mr Modi said.
Russian Ambassador Alexander Kadakin told The Hindu that the meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Modi was “extremely productive.”

Zinc up by 0.2% on overseas cuesZinc up by 0.2% on overseas cues

Taking positive cues from the global market and better domestic demand, zinc futures prices today edged up by 0.22% to Rs 135.85 per kg, as speculators created positions.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, zinc for delivery in current month up by 30 paise, or 0.22%, to Rs 135.85 per kg, with a business turnover of 142 lots.

Globally, at the London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc for delivery in three months advanced 0.4% to $2,187.75 per tonne. The metal has advanced 6.5% this year so far.
Marketmen said besides a firming trend at domestic spot market, metal's rebound from the lowest level in five months at the LME as the dollar headed for the longest losing streak since July, making commodities priced in greenbacks more attractive to investors, supported the upside in zinc prices at futures trade.

Nickel prices moved up by 0.43% to Rs 1,027.80 per kg in futures market today after speculators enlarged positions, tracking a firming trend in spot market on increased demand from alloy-makers.

In a similar manner, the metal for delivery in current month rose by Rs 3.60, or 0.40%, to Rs 1,020.60 per kg in 193 lots.

After Delhi  Thailand too orders Uber to cease operationsTata Motors sales up 10 pct in December
Thailand ordered US online taxi booking company Uber to cease operations immediately for improperly using cars and unregistered drivers on Tuesday, a day after the firm was barred in New Delhi over the alleged rape incident in a taxi plying for it.
“They have to stop operations immediately,” Director- General of Department of Land Transport Thiraphong Rodprasert told reporters after meeting officials from Uber and rival firm GrabTaxi and EasyTaxi to discuss regulating Internet taxi services.
Uber — which operates the premium Uber Black limousine-like service and the discounted Uber X service which competes directly with taxis in Bangkok and Phuket — bills itself as an on-demand transportation provider.
Rides are booked through smartphone applications or the Internet and paid only via credit card.
The firm was improperly using cars with green-lettered license plates — similar to airport limousines — and personal vehicles with black-lettered plates, Thiraphong was quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying on Friday.
The drivers were using the cars in a manner contrary to that stated in their registration. He said the drivers were illegally operating by not charging approved rates.
Thiraphong further said drivers did not hold required public-transport drivers licences and were not registered in a database of public-vehicle drivers.
Thailand’s Transport department today reaffirmed its earlier decision holding Uber taxi as operating illegally in the country but said it preferred not to call it a ban.
Thiraphong said that private black plate vehicles are not allowed to ply as taxis because the drivers are not registered for public transport.
The transport department had on Friday launched a crackdown on Uber drivers, saying those stopped by police could be fined 2,000 baht (4000 rupees) for using the wrong vehicle, 1,000 baht for not charging approved fares and 1,000 baht for not having a public-vehicle driver’s license.
The department further objected to the credit card-only method of payment in Thailand, citing concerns about transaction security.
In Southeast Asia, Indonesia has raised questions over Uber’s tax payments and Malaysia’s Road Transport Department has warned the users that they would not be covered by insurance if they were involved in a crash.
Singapore, meanwhile, has announced the implementation of new rules for third-party taxi booking apps, including Uber and GrabTaxi.
All operations by private cab service Uber were banned in New Delhi yesterday and it was blacklisted from providing any transport service in the wake of the alleged rape incident in a taxi plying for it.
The action came after a taxi driver employed by Uber was arrested from Mathura for allegedly raping a 27-year-old woman executive in his cab.

Heavy online discounts drying up: Jabongs co-founderJabong
(“If I map the market, Myntra plays…)
NEW DELHI: Don't expect the big offers from e-commerce companies to last forever. The companies that have been undercutting rivals and the rest of the retail industry with heavy discounts to build scale, are now gradually turning their focus to profitability.
E-commerce companies have already started cutting down on their daily or weekly discounts that were generally given on a wide range of products, said Praveen Sinha , co-founder of fashion portal Jabong .
"Overall, I would say discounts have to stabilise, but I would say that there will be always some discounts there for e-commerce companies as we have the advantage of scale and we don't have the real-estate and overhead costs associated with that of offline retailers." ET had reported earlier this month that Myntra, India's largest fashion ecommerce portal and Jabong's rival, is pruning costs, improving supply-chain efficiencies and seeking more margins from brands in its quest to break even in the next 18 months.
"If I map the market, Myntra plays an important role and if any corrections are coming down, then there is a player in the market which is getting stable," Sinha said in an interview with ET at his Gurgaon office on Monday.

Early investors in Indian e-commerce book huge profitsAccel Partners
(Amid all the cash burn and…)
MUMBAI: Amid all the cash burn and eye-popping valuations, early investors in India's burgeoning e-commerce sector are beginning to book profits. TOI has learnt that Bengaluru-based venture fund Kalaari Capital may be in the process of executing a secondary sale of shares worth $100 million (Rs 610 crore) in Delhi-based Snapdeal.
The e-tailer's bigger rival, Flipkart, saw a similar secondary transaction a few months back, revealed sources. Early backers of the country's largest e-commerce player like Accel Partners part-sold their shares in a $150 million (Rs 910 crore) round. This round also saw some investors and employees in Myntra, which was bought out by Flipkart earlier this year and became its shareholders, selling their shares.
A secondary sale is when an existing investor sells shares to a new one or the promoter at the company's current valuation. The money does not come into the company's coffers. Secondary deals have been common among private equity funds in India, but are comparatively rare for venture capitalists.
Vani Kola, MD at Kalaari Capital -- which is now a shareholder in Flipkart as an early Myntra investor -- did not respond to a query from TOI regarding the secondary transaction at Snapdeal. Accel Partners also did not offer any comments till the time of going to press about selling shares in Flipkart.
One of the first investors in Flipkart back in 2009, Accel had put in a million dollars in the company, which is now valued at over $10 billion. Kalaari, which first invested in the e-tailer as IndoUS Ventures, has in all put $25 million (Rs 150 crore) in Snapdeal over the past five years and holds around 14% stake in the online commerce player.
"Exits of early investors via secondary transactions is a very healthy trend and fills the last mile of the investing ecosystem. Exits are the lifeblood of venture capital and have been an issue in India. So this is an encouraging development and shows maturation of the process,' said Avnish Bajaj , MD at early-stage VC fund Matrix Partners India.
Sources privy to the matter told TOI that Kalaari, an early-stage $160 million fund, was likely to shed a small single digit stake, giving it a windfall return nearly the size of its current fund. Sources said the secondary deal was being done at a higher valuation to the SoftBank round which valued Snapdeal at around $2 billion. The Japanese telecom and internet giant, which pumped $627 million into the company, owns about 32% in Snapdeal.
The exact size of these secondary deals at Snapdeal, Flipkart and Myntra and the identity of the buyers could not be ascertained immediately.
Silicon Valley fund Bessemer Venture Partners , another early investor in Snapdeal, part liquidated its shareholding in the company, booking gains on its investment during the SoftBank round itself.
The country's top online commerce players including Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon have been bleeding on account of their frenetic growth and discounting to lure customers on to their platforms. TOI carried a report last week stating that almost a billion dollars in investor money was being guzzled up by the larger e-tailers collectively on account of advertising, discounting and increasing their employee strength. Flipkart and Snapdeal alone have raised about $3 billion this year from investors.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Executives of SpiceJet and its parent, the Sun Group, met India's aviation regulator on Thursday to assure him of the airline's ability to survive. Officials at the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said they wouldn't soften their tough stand on the beleaguered carrier unless it produces a "concrete plan."
"They (SpiceJet) have told us that they are preparing a definitive plan, which they will present to us. They also wanted us to relax the advancing booking limit, which we have limited to one month. We have told them to come up with a definitive plan before December 15, 2014, and any decision will be taken based on their plan," said an official at the regulator's office, who did not want to be named.
SpiceJet officials also met officials of the state owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials. However, AAI has declined to relax its stand and the airline will be put on cash-and-carry if it does not make payments to the airport operator by Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter.
Tuesday was the first time that executives from Sun Group headed by its finance chief SL Narayanan came to meet the DGCA. SpiceJet had a day long board meeting on Monday leading to market rumours that news of investments—internal or external—was imminent. There was, however, no announcement. DGCA officials said SpiceJet didn't speak of any potential investment. Narayanan has, meanwhile, sought a meeting with aviation minister Ashok Gajapati Raju Pusapati .
On December 5, DGCA withdrew 186 flight slots of SpiceJet and barred the airline from booking flights beyond the month of December. This followed large-scale cancellation of flights by the airline, which is struggling to make monthly rental payments to leasing companies. As a result, the airline has returned 15 Boeing 737 planes in the last few months reducing its fleet size to 37 planes in December. Its total number of flights has reduced to 232 from 345.
The DGCA has asked the airline to refund passengers hit by the cancellation of flights by December 15. The airline has already refunded 55,000 passengers, according to figures with the regulator. The regulator also told SpiceJet to pay salaries to its employees on the 7th of every month.

(The JV will leverage RIL’s existing…)
MUMBAI: Reliance Industries, which begun life as a textile company, has decided to hive off its oldest business into a joint venture with China's Shandong Ruyi Science and Technology Group Co, the Indian conglomerate said on Tuesday. The group diversified from trading to manufacturing textiles, largely polyester yarn, in the 1960s. Reliance Textiles was incorporated in 1966 and it is this company which later became Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) in 1985.
RIL is currently India's third largest private sector company by market capitalisation and the largest by far in revenues. RIL will hold a 51% stake in the new joint venture thus formed while the Chinese partner will hold the balance. The company sells products — primarily fabric for suits — under the 'Vimal' brand.
"Our joint venture with Ruyi Group will help Reliance reposition its textile business on a high growth path. Our partner's deep commitment and global reach in textile business will enable this JV to harness the growth potential of the Indian market and emerge as a global textile player," said Nikhil R Meswani, executive director, RIL. The proposed transaction is subject to obtaining requisite approvals. A RIL spokesman told ET that the two companies are yet to decide on the financial consideration.
The JV will leverage RIL's existing textile business and distribution network in India and Ruyi's state-ofthe-art technology and its global reach. It will expand the geography for the brand 'Vimal' besides introducing brands owned by Ruyi in India. RIL has a presence in Indian textile market, especially in the worsted and synthetic suiting fabric segments, while the $3 billion-Ruyi, a leading textile company in China, has a presence in America, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and China. Ruyi owns brands like 'Taylor & Lodge', 'Harris Tweed', 'Royal Ruyi China', 'Nogara Italy' and 'Indios Italy', among others. In India, Ruyi sells the 'Georgia Gullini' brand in the worsted suiting segment of the market. "This business operation and activities would get realigned to strengthen the JV," the press release said.
"With closer economic relations between China and India and Shandong Ruyi Group's expanding global presence in the textile sector, we see our joint venture with Reliance as a significant event for the group. To enter the Indian market with Reliance we truly believe in the bright future of this joint venture business," said Qiu Yafu, chairman, Shandong Ruyi Group.
India has been among the top three textile and apparel exporting nations in the world for the last three years. The CII-BCG report on 'Make in India' states that India is expected to grow as an exporter of textile and apparels but also that much of the potential is yet to be tapped.

MUMBAI: Reliance Industries today hit the international debt market to raise up to $ 1 billion (about Rs 6,150 crore) by selling 10-year dollar-denominated bonds.
While the company refused to confirm or deny the development citing market sensitivity of the issue, market sources said the dollar-bond sale programme is already in the market and the Mukesh Ambani-led company will close the issue tonight.
The largest private sector company has raised $ 3.3 billion in overseas debt this year so far and today's issue will take the overall debt raising to $ 4.3 billion by it.
In January 2013, Reliance became the first company from Asia to issue $ 800 million worth of perpetual debt to international investors at a coupon rate of 5.875 per cent.
A perpetual bond is one which has no fixed maturity date.
Ambani has unveiled an over Rs 1.8 trillion capex plan for the next three years with a good portion of that going into his soon to be launched telecom venture under the brand name Reliance Jio, into which the company has announced a whopping $ 12 billion investment.
It can be noted that in April this year the company had tied up for $ 550 million from Japanese investment agency JICA and $ 800 million in September this year from the Korean Exim Bank.
Traditionally, much of RIL's investments are being funded through overseas borrowings.
Despite sitting on a cash pile of close Rs 84,000 crore, the company is one of the most prolific borrowers with its total debt outstanding standing at over Rs 1.4 trillion as of the September quarter.
The company has hired as many as 11 i-bankers including HSBC , Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Standard Chartered .
Investors have lapped debt issuance by domestic corporates like hot cakes with international bond sale rising 52 per cent so far this year to sniff at $ 20 billion over the same period last year, according to industry estimates.

View: National database of sexual offenders neededDecember 10, 2014, 5:05 am IST Economic Times in ET Commentary | India | ET

By: Anjana Menon
Uber, the cab-hailing service, has been grounded in Delhi after a woman alleged she was raped by one of its drivers. It turns out that he was a convicted rapist, but Uber didn’t know that. Uber argued it didn’t do driver checks as they are not required by law for licensed taxi drivers.
It is an excuse without legs. It is vital to do the maximum possible to ensure women’s safety, not the minimum,  in a country where public policing has collapsed and the attitude to women is largely predatory. It’s also time the government introduced an online record on criminality that gives some power to citizens.
In India, where a rape is reported every 21 minutes, savagery against women is not restricted to cab services. A few days ago in cosmopolitan Bengaluru, a kindergarten child was allegedly raped by a school attendant. That was the second such incident in the city in three months. In Mumbai, a photojournalist was assaulted in an abandoned textile mill by a group of men more than a year ago. They were repeat offenders.
Nothing is off-limits. In July, an 81-year-old lady living in a tiny Delhi neighbourhood was raped, strangled and set on fire by her helper. Four years ago, a medical intern raped a patient in a private Mumbai hospital repeatedly. In Jaipur, a pastor has been arrested a few weeks ago for sexually harassing two minor girls at his orphanage.
By day and night, women in India face degrees of intimidation. In offices, women who speak up are labelled aggressive. In public places, men seem to think it’s perfectly normal to brush against women, make catcalls and stalk them.
As a nation, we take great comfort in making women uncomfortable. The attitude, which holds women responsible for their own lack of safety, unites gender, religion, caste, age and class, the stuff that usually divides the country. Enterprises know only too well how unsafe India is for women. Uber would have known that too.
Firms in India should be asked to list what they have done to keep users and employees safe in annual audits, just like they do for finances. That goes for the pizza company that sends delivery men to people’s homes as well as tech firms that send women back in hired cars, to hospitals and schools that hire caregivers.
As the prime minister calls for a digital India, there is room to make some criminality reports, a part of the outreach. India needs to have a public online registry, with biometric details of those who have been convicted for rapes. All citizens should have access to this information so that they can check potential employees, and those offering third-party services can be verified. For too long, we have been shaming women. We should name and shame those who violate them.
A similar national digital police registry, less public, should be a mandatory step to mark out those who have been accused, but not convicted. This information should be made available to those seeking it for hiring services. It’s as essential for public safety as a body frisk is at airports, hotels and cinemas, and be made imperative for every class of employee.
If the government conducts criminal checks before issuing passports and we don’t get offended, why can’t a similar report be issued to show that those in public services can be trusted. This is not to say there will be no rapes and that this will guarantee a woman’s safety. That will take better policing, swift redressals, citizen awareness and much more.
At the very least, a registry will mark out offenders. It will also put some pressure on those who feel they can commit crimes with no consequence. It will confer a tangible value to character.
Indians, several of them in leadership roles, speak openly and disparagingly against women and continue to stay in office. The public outrage against them lasts for two prime-time television shows. A few days later, these very people arrogate on social issues on television screens.
In short, our anger against violence on women is mostly superficial. As a nation we don’t rise to boycott bad values. That will take longer to change. For now, let’s get going with what can be pinned.

Time for TRAI to reopen Integrated Emergency Communication SystemDecember 10, 2014, 4:54 am IST V. Sridhar in Telecom tête à tête | India | ET
0
By V Sridhar and R Venkateswaran
As the latest incident of rape in Delhi indicates, it is time the government and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) reopen the deployment of a universal single number-based Integrated Emergency Communication and Response System (IECRS).
The victim in last week’s radio taxi incident dialled the police emergency number 100 only after two hours, and that too after sending multiple text messages. The driver was subsequently arrested through a search based on his mobile number, as the global positioning system (GPS) was not immediately available. Even as a GPS based vehicle-tracking system is being pushed through by the road ministry in 32 cities with control centres, an IECRS will provide an additional aspect of security for commuters.
There are two important aspects of a numbering service: to identify the caller and to identify the location from where the call is originating.Thanks to broadband, GPS and social media, these two vital parameters can be captured and sent in emergencies without the intervention of telecom operators. A number of apps such as bSafe, Family GPS Tracker and Eyewatch allow the sending of emergency communication to friends and relatives. Apps such as Truecaller provide the identification of the caller with accuracy. However, most of these apps require smartphones that only about 15 per cent of mobile subscribers in India have.
Trai had floated a consultation paper on IECRS last year. But probably due to the resistance of operators, this step was half-crossed without a recommendation and any policy guideline. While there are indications that a variant of the 2002 Communications Convergence Bill is being resurrected, it is the right time to mandate a universal emergency numbering service and include it in the policy. Disparate emergency numbers do exist for different services. But the need of the hour is an easier-to-remember, one-number emergency numbering service.
Though the Trai consultation paper clearly indicates the advantages of IECRS, the thorny issue seems to be about who will bear the cost of the telecom infrastructure upgrade.Telcos will be required to incur capital expenditure for feature implementation, network capability enhancement and recurring operation expenses. Is this cost to be borne by the user as surcharge? Or to be funded through the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)? Or to be borne by the operators?
Though practices vary across countries, one way to look at it is to split the capex between government and telcos, and the opex to be borne through a surcharge to the users.There is close to Rs 16,000 crore in the books of the USOF that can be partly used for funding. Though it is a bit trickier to charge the users in a predominantly prepaid market, the user gains utility by having a single-number emergency service, and should be able to pay for the marginal cost of providing the service.India is in a position to leapfrog in this technology implementation since no legacy network infrastructure exists. The National Emergency Number Association (Nena) in the US has come out with specifications for all forms of modes of emergency communications. We should deploy the latest Nena Stage-3 type solution in India.
Finally, governments at all levels will have to work together to deploy adequately-trained emergency response personnel and the associated equipment in the Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) countrywide to tackle the severity of the problem on hand. Single number based IECRS can only be an enabler.

Govt cannot go wrong. Blame it all on private enterprisesDelhi rape case
(Even if cab aggregators…)
In the days following the arrest of a driver in the Uber network for rape there have been a flurry of actions by the authorities, all designed no doubt to give the impression that the mighty Indian state is a caring and compassionate being. Uber and those like it--Olacabs and TaxiForSure—have been banned in the national capital because they are presumably illegal. And the home ministry is advising states to follow Delhi's lead and shut down the business of the taxi aggregators.
So as a result of these exertions, are Indians--specifically women--safer on city streets? No. Is the government helping the cause of providing safe, affordable transportation for its citizens? No.
Banning a service that customers have taken to in the absence of comparable alternatives is hardly the answer to what is a deep-rooted issue in a country where public transport systems are still immature.
Just like Ola and TaxiForSure , tech-based companies are being set up almost every day in India to provide convenient and safe solutions for a middle class that is hungry for better services in areas such as housing, healthcare, entertainment, retail and travel.
While new-economy ventures are being set up at a rapid rate, they are forced to deal with the same old government—flat-footed when it comes to doing its job but quick to pass the blame. The fault is all someone else's because our authorities—at the central state and municipal levels—are just not accountable while Uber, Ola and other private enterprises can be made to pay a price and to learn their lessons.
That is why, for example, Amazon is scurrying around trying to convince commercial tax authorities that it is not liable to pay tax for storing goods on behalf of merchants.
That is also why banks are being made to pay a price for the failures of the state. In Bengaluru, police has put the onus on banks for providing security at ATMs, but they fail to catch the culprit more than a year after a woman was attacked with a machete inside an ATM kiosk.
If new-economy companies are under siege, it is not their fault alone. The institutions of the state must own up for the current disarray. In several cases they are unable to understand the business model of these companies and, as in the case of Uber, have admitted to being unaware of the existence of such a service. This is a horrific admission and one that leaves citizens--who have a right to expect that their government is indeed governing and not asleep on the job—feeling more helpless. To allay fears, what does the government do? It bans the service but does not offer any real and lasting solution to the problems of passengers.
Let us consider the issue of police verification, which could have prevented the crime. Even if cab aggregators were verifying the criminal antecedents of drivers, can we vouch for the integrity of the police verification system?
India's largest third-party provider of background checking services no longer carries out police verification after a scandal in which fake police seals were used to give a clean chit to hundreds of candidates. This was ostensibly because the police, which was asked to do criminal background checks of job aspirants, just would not cooperate.
But there is reason for hope. It is because of what the central bank is doing after it found itself flatfooted by the new economy some months ago. After insisting that online credit card transactions need two levels of authentication, the RBI has come around to saying that for small transactions the two-factor authentication may not be needed after all. Will PM Modi do likewise and make far-reaching reform his legacy?

SpiceJet  Kingfisher s pain is Jet s gain; stock up 87% in 3 monthsSpiceJet, Kingfisher's pain is Jet Airways' gain, stock up 87% in 3 mths
BT Online Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 19, 2014  | 08:21 IST
The Jet Airways stock it seems has gained the most out of plight of its rivals Kingfisher Airlines and SpiceJet Ltd. The fall in crude oil prices has also helped the stock.
Trading in stock of Kingfisher Airlines has been suspended on the BSE and NSE on December 1. Earlier, the Vijay Mallya-owned airlines had been in news for all wrong reasons. The airlines had outstanding loan of nearly Rs 7,500 crore (now amounting to Rs 4,000 crore) to  a consortium of 17 banks led by State Bank of India. Kingfisher never reported a profit since it was listed on the exchanges.
Another airline hit by the crisis is SpiceJet . The airline has reported 5th straight quarter of net losses for the July-September period, at Rs 310 crore, although it is down from the year-ago period when it had a net loss of Rs 559 crore.
Graph by Rahul Oberoi
The fact may sound comforting for the low-cost carrier but numerous discount offers and weak financials have taken a toll on its operations. The airline auditors in a report in November have cast doubts over the ability of media baron Kalanithi Maran's budget carrier to run it as a "going concern".
The carrier was recently in news as it cancelled over 1,800 flights across the country for December 2014. Around 125 pilots also left the airline to join its rivals.
The strong financials of Jet Airways also swing the conditions in its favour. The airline reported narrowing of consolidated loss by a whopping 95.7 per cent at Rs 43 crore in the three months to September on the back of spurt in operational efficiency. The airline had reported a net loss of Rs 999 crore in the same quarter a year ago.
Offlate, the Jet Airways' stock has risen due to a fall in global crude oil prices. Analysts say that every US $1/bbl fall in crude prices can boost Jet Airways' operating profit estimate for the 2015-16 financial year by 4-5 per cent.
Weakness at rivals will also boost sales of Jet Airways, say traders, as SpiceJet has cut its fleet size to save costs.
During the last three months, the stock has risen 87 per cent till date. On September 11, the stock traded at Rs 233 level on the BSE.
The stock on Wednesday closed 3.51 per cent higher on fall in crude oil prices. Analysts say every $1/bbl fall in crude can boost the carrier's FY16 operating profit estimate by 4-5 per cent. Brent crude prices dipped 1.3 per cent to US $65.98 a barrel on Wednesday, though they remained above a five-year low of US $65.29 reached on Tuesday.

Kargil revenge for India s B desh role: MusharrafIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
Pakistan’s former military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf has said he believes in a tit-for-tat policy on all fronts and claimed that Kargil conflict was in response to India’s role in the creation of Bangladesh.
71-year-old former president, who masterminded the Kargil conflict in 1999 and ruled over Pakistan for nine years, said that India had played role in creating Bangladesh and trying to seize Siachin.
“They also undertook such operations so Kargil also happened,” he told Samaa TV channel.
“I believed in a tit-for-tat policy on all fronts,” said Musharraf, who was the chief of the Pakistani army during the Kargil conflict in 1999.
Musharraf, who is currently facing treason charges, said that “friendship with India is only possible on equal terms and with both countries respecting each other.”
He said if India would take one step towards friendship Pakistan would respond by taking two steps forward.
“People think I don’t want friendship with India it is not like that. Relations with India were good in my tenure. We were close to resolving major disputes pertaining to Kashmir, Sir Creek and water treaty,” Musharraf said.
He said that friendship with India was possible even with the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“We should have good relations with India even if Modi is prime minister but not by bowing down to India or accepting their aggression. If they continue in aggressive acts and proxy acts then we can also respond in similar fashion,” he added.

Let s be adults  let s talk about tackling pornprint
‘The sexual content that kids are accessing today… has put entire society in danger so also safety threats to public order in India, Petitioner most respectfully submits that  most of the offences committed against women/girls/children are fuelled by pornography.
The worrying issue is the severity and the gravity of the images is increasing. It is a matter of serious concern that prepubescent children being raped…. Petitioner is shocked to read the internet pornography statistics, wherein most shocking data are given, wherein every second 5,000 porn sites were  watched, since from 2005… it estimates about more than 20 crore porn video/porn clippings including child pornography, are freely available in Indian market.
This is an excerpt from a writ petition that Kamlesh Vaswani, a lawyer from Indore, filed before the Supreme Court of India in 2013. I am no lawyer, but in general the petition appears poorly drafted and written, makes sweeping, unsubstantiated generalisations and uses data from — wikipedia?
Thousands of petitions are filed in India’s courts, but Vaswani’s effort is important because it was the basis for a meeting on November 5, 2014 in New Delhi, chaired by India’s minister for communication and information technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad, and attended by 24 government officials and industry representatives. The officials came from the ministries of defence, home affairs, legal affairs, electronics, telecommunications, commerce, the Central Bureau of Investigation and Maharashtra’s anti-terror squad.
The ostensible reason for the meeting was to discuss how pornography — which Vaswani argues is a “moral cancer that is eating our entire society”, putting at risk India’s “peace of mind, health and wellness, happiness and human potential”— could be blocked. It can be done, of course, as China does with what is called the great firewall of China, an Internet filter that blocks public access to websites deemed not to be in their interest. In China a search for the word “democracy” or “persecution” leads to the message “page cannot be displayed”. India now appears to be on a similar path with words such as “dominatrix” or “pornography”— for starters.
As Nikhil Pahwa of Medianama.com, a site that tracks the digital media, recently observed, the November 5 meeting was focused on “not whether there should be a filter at all, but how such a filter should be implemented”. Indeed, like some others at the meeting, Kamlesh Bajaj, CEO of the Data Security Council of India, an independent organisation that monitors data protection, pointed to the “unintended consequences” of blocking websites. “However, the chairman stressed that larger issue of respecting cultural values of the country and sentiments of the Indian society need to be considered and all possible ways and means may have to be devised in this context,” the minutes noted.
This is where the government’s intentions become fuzzy and dodgy. Fuzzy because pornography, in whatever country, has always defied definition. Dodgy because “cultural values”— especially as we have lately seen in India — are a slippery slope to authoritarian behaviour.
There are some aspects to pornography that are unexceptionable, such as child porn, the involvement of children in sex videos or images. Most countries in the West do not ban porn, but they do ban child porn, although it still slips between the electronic cracks of the Internet.
There are three well-worn questions around banning porn in general:
One, how do you define porn?
Two, is porn responsible for rape and violence against women?
Three, can you really stop the flow of porn?
The answer to the last question comes from Pahwa, in an earlier post. He writes: “There’s too much of it, in too many places, and there will always be workarounds.”
The answer to two in Vaswani’s opinion: “Petitioner strongly believes that most of the crimes against women/girls/children like gang rape and sexual assault are definitely fuelled by watching pornograph (sic).”
Intuitive as Vaswani’s contention might appear, the effects of porn have been inconclusively debated for decades. “Evidence for a causal relationship between exposure to pornography and sexual aggression is slim and may, at certain times, have been exaggerated by politicians, pressure groups and some social scientists,” says a 2009 study in the journal Aggression and Violent Behavior. It continues: “Victimisation rates for rape in the United States demonstrate an inverse relationship between pornography consumption and rape rates. Data from other nations have suggested similar relationships.”
The answer to the first question is the most difficult, as it has always been in any country. As the Internet Service Providers’ Association of India, one of the respondents to Vaswani’s petition, observed in its reply to the Supreme Court: “One man’s pornography is another man’s high art.”
It isn’t as if watching porn is illegal in India. Watching porn is legal. Only the production, distribution and sharing of porn is illegal. This is an important legal distinction. Vaswani’s goal is to break down that distinction and make everything about porn, from its possession to its viewing, against the law.
With epochal change upon Indian society, it is time for a scientific discussion around and public consultation about pornography and obscenity, much as the US did with two federal commissions on the subject in 1970 and 1986. However, the results in that country were inconclusive and the judicial commitment to free speech is so strong, that, as Rosemary Tong, a writer, put it, “the court will not ban depictions of the sexual abuse of women as it has the yelling of ‘fire’ in a crowded theatre”.
India need not, necessarily, follow what another country does, but we must publicly discuss what millions — myself included — with access to a computer or cellphone do in private — watch porn.

Sensex Falls 250 Points, Nifty Below 8,300
NDTV | Updated On: December 11, 2014 11:26 (IST)
L&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
Indian stock markets tumbled after a flat start on Thursday with the BSE Sensex falling over 270 points or 0.9 per cent in morning trade. The broader Nifty slipped below the key 8,300 mark for the first time since November 7.
Thursday's selloff came on the back of weakness in global sentiments. Most stock markets in Asia traded with deep cuts after the Dow fell over 200 points overnight. Global markets have been falling because of a crash in energy stocks, which are being weighed down by lower crude prices.
The fall in crude prices is good for India, which imports nearly 80 per cent of its oil needs. However, domestic oil companies have come under pressure because of pressure on margins.
Gail India was down 2.2 per cent, off day's lows. ONGC, Cairn India and Reliance Industries were also among the top Nifty losers.
Other stocks to witness selling pressure today included index heavyweight Infosys, which tumbled for the 10th straight day, down 1.75 per cent.
Only twelve Nifty stocks traded higher. IT outsourcer Tech Mahindra was up 1.1 per cent, while Bhel was the top Nifty gainer with 2.1 per cent gains. UltraTech Cement, Bajaj Auto were among the other Nifty gainers.
Sugar stocks surged on Thursday after the government approved ethanol procurement. Bajaj Hindusthan and Shree Renuka Sugars jumped over 6 per cent, while Balrampur Chini traded 7 per cent higher.
The slowing down in buying by foreign funds also seems to have impacted the momentum in stock markets. The Sensex and Nifty have gained nearly 35 per cent year-to-date on the back of around $40 billion buying by FIIs.
On Wednesday, FIIs bought cash shares worth just Rs 5 crore. The rupee also weakened to 62.17 per dollar in morning trade, weighting on sentiments, analysts said.
Market analyst Sarvendra Srivastava told NDTV that 8,400 remains a hurdle for Nifty and 8,180-8,200 levels could be tested in the near term.
As of 11.15 a.m., the Sensex traded 199 points lower at 27,631, while the Nifty traded 57 points lower at 8,298.

5 ways incubators can help startups bootstrap5 ways incubators can help startups bootstrap

What are Incubators?
Incubators are an organization, platform or team of experienced professionals that helps startups bootstrap during its early stages and often provides mentoring, guidance, co-working space and also at times some funding. Traditionally incubators are the first port of call for any budding entrepreneur. Incubators work on the same age old principles of providing the right assistance to fledging startups, but have proved to be a very important cog in the startup wheel.
Why Incubators
An entrepreneur can have a brilliant idea that solves a real problem or has great utility, but commercializing it and making money from it is a different game altogether. Often young entrepreneurs struggle when it comes to executing their business plan and commercializing the idea as most do not have a business background. Even young entrepreneurs who have passed out from business schools often find the going tough. Starting up needs active guidance, mentoring and a considerable amount of hand holding, something that an incubator can provide. Experienced professionals and people who have been through the startup process often provide invaluable help and guidance.
When
Incubators are not meant for everyone. If you are an early stage startup still in its bootstrapping phase, incubators make perfect sense. For more established startups who have perhaps raised Series A or even an angel round, being a part of an incubator may not be ideal. Having said that there are a number of startups that have raised some funding and continue being a part of an incubator as they derive value from it.
What to expect
Below are some of the ways Incubators can help startups bootstrap
1. Validation of Idea - For a founder his idea is always the best, often considers it revolutionary and above reproach. However, in cases it may not hold true. Every idea needs to be validated on whether it can work. There are times when an idea, maybe be innovative but may not have commercial potential or does not address a compelling problem.
An incubator helps an entrepreneur decide if his idea can address the market needs, carry out market research to determine the best mix, get feedback and also develop a market ready prototype.
2. Mentoring support - A young entrepreneur often needs mentoring about the various nuances of starting up. For a first time entrepreneur, multiple aspects of business such as marketing ,sales , business development ,operations and finance needs to be well understood and planned beyond the technology solution for a problem.
A mentor who has experience in starting up or possesses business acumen is a good sounding board and can help the founder in ironing out a lot of issues. There are times when a startup may need to pivot from its original stand and a good mentor would be very effective in pointing the correct direction.
3. Co-working space - An entrepreneur is always cash starved and rarely would you come across a founder flush with cash. At such a stage investing in getting a proper office is a costly proposition and hence incubators with their co-working spaces become a hot favourite. Co-working space with a number of other startups and entrepreneurs also become a vibrant and a melting pot of many ideas. Entrepreneurs at incubators often support each other in their endeavors and help ride difficult times. Incubators often build lasting relationship and friendship between entrepreneurs doing different startups.
4. Support in fund raising - Incubators are often well entrenched in the eco-system and are well networked. A good idea that has been validated and has shown potential can often expect investor interest to develop via the incubator route. Most incubators run demo days where the entrepreneur has a chance to present his idea before investors to secure funding. Investors also like startups from incubators as they have a certain amount of faith on well known incubators and expect the ideas and startups to be vetted to a large extent.
5. Shared Resource Pool - Incubators often provides shared resource pool of rockstars experts in specific areas including technology which helps startup in faster realization of their idea.
Future of Incubators
Incubators are an intrinsic part of the startup eco-system and play a very crucial role in the development of an entrepreneur. Incubators are here to stay and its role and importance is increasingly being appreciated in the country. Considering most of the startups in the country are by young professionals, incubators have a pivotal role to play.

E-auction made mandatory in MaharashtraE-auction made mandatory in Maharashtra
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 10:35 AM IST
In order to streamline the system of auction and bring transperancy, the Maharashtra government has made e-auction mandatory from January 1 next year.
The e-auction was implemented in some districts on pilot basis earlier which has received good response. Currently, auction of sand, government land and tendu leaves is done on e-auction.
According to a Government Resolution (GR) of last week, the e-auction system will be implemented in all government offices, urban and rural local bodies, public undertakings with a reserve price of Rs one lakh or more.
The GR said the decision will help boost government revenue as well.
All departments have been asked to use the Chennai based National Informatics Centre (NIC) platform for the purpose and also keep data backups.

Havells India eyes 13-13.5% EBITDA margins in FY1508:00 am
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Anil Rai Gupta, joint managing director of  Havells India spoke about the company’s performance in the first half and outlook for the company going forward.
Although there has been a demand slowdown in the third quarter compared to the first half, the slowdown is temporary and is expected to pick up going forward, says Rai Gupta. There has been an overall slowdown in sales growth for all their segments, he adds.
According to him the reform steps taken by the new government will take some time to be realized on ground.
He is confident that the overall growth in FY15 will be better than FY14 and is hopeful of achieving 13-13.5% EBITDA margins for the domestic market and 5-6% for international markets in FY15.
As of now, 60 percent of the company’s revenues come from domestic and rest from overseas markets. Amongst the international markets, Sylvania is doing better than the rest, says …
When asked if there would be more ad spends in the coming quarters to enhance demand, he says their product sales are not dependent on ad spends and they are more focused on brand building.
Below is the transcript of Anil Rai Gupta’s interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Sonia: Where are you feeling the pain the most in terms of segment wise performance and what was the key reasons for cutting the revenue guidance this time?
A: We started of the year with a very good first quarter with almost 21 percent growth and lot of it coming from the cables and wires segment. At that time the feeling was that this could percolate down to other product categories or this is a more of a pent up demand, or a case of low base last year. However, it has tapered a little bit in the second quarter, which was down to about 16-17 percent and in the third quarter also we are not seeing much uptick in demand.
Basically, the initial euphoria just after the elections is over, so the 20 percent growth that we were achieving may not be possible to contnue for the entire year.
However, it is not too much of a pain point at this moment. It is just the fact that whatever reforms the economy is talking about normally it would take a little bit more time to be realised on ground.
Last year we had a 10 percent growth we are definitely seeing a better year this year. However, may be the kind of effect that we wanted to see after the elections that is not evident as of now.
Sonia: You did mentioned that 21 percent growth is what you saw in the first half of the year in cables and wires in the second half how much do you think it could slow down to?
A: It is difficult to say, we do feel that there is a little bit of a tapering down in the overall sales growth - in cables, wires as well as consumer durables and lighting. The growth is not as good as we saw in the first quarter. But it is difficult to put a number because we still have another four months left in this year. So, let’s hope for the best but it is just that the growth is better than last year but not as good as in the first quarter.
Latha: Is this entirely a domestic worry? What is your export or external market exposure. How are the European markets doing?
A: The European markets are doing better this year, we are seeing growth in Sylvania revenues. We are expecting a five to six percent EBITDA margins, operational margins in the international markets or in Sylvania margins and I think we will be able to achieve that. So, there except a few Latin America issues of foreign exchange and all that but still we are expecting the operational EBITDA that we had envisaged.
Latha: What is the percentage spilt between external and domestic markets?
A: Almost 60 percent we get in India and the rest 40 percent comes form International.
Latha: It is that 60 percent where you are seeing pressure of demand?
A: I would say that it is not as good as it was in the first quarter. We would definitely hope to achieve better results in the coming quarters. However, at this moment it is as I said better than last year but not as good as the first quarter.
Sonia: What would the blended margins of the company look like by the end of FY15?
A: We still hope to achieve 13-13.50 percent EBITDA margins in this domestic market so there we do not see much of a problem. We will continue to invest in our brand building activities and distribution enhancement. We are investing for the future and so I don’t see any major issues in the domestic market in the medium to long-term. This is just a short-term pressure points at this moment. In the international markets we are still expecting 5-6 percent EBITDA margins.
Latha: There was talk that the fall in European bond yields means less earnings in Sylvania and therefore some pressure when you have to payout pensions. Should we expect some pressure on the profit and loss (P&L) because of that?
A: It is a book entry because as I said operational EBITDA would continue to remain the same. We do not have to payout pensions, as of now this is more of a book entry and a non-cash item. Yes, if the high bond yield would mean a higher provision for pensions that could affect the P&L but it is a non-cash item.
Sonia: Can you just throw a little more colour on where you are seeing the demand slow down quite a bit. I heard you mentioned cables and wires but what about the other segments like lighting and fixtures. In the quarter gone by your switch gears business, your lighting and fixtures business even your electric consumer business did quite well. You managed to see at least a 15 percent growth in revenues. However, for FY16 which is the segment that you are worried about the most?
A: FY16 we are not really too concerned about. This is more of a short-term issue as I said probably by the end of the financial year or the first quarter next year we will start seeing the uptick again. As I said this is not something which is division oriented or sector oriented it is overall slowdown in the housing sector which could affect the demand for all our product categories.
However, this is more of a short-term thing because we have seen very good growth in the first and the second quarter so we are just being a bit cautious in the third and fourth quarter and let’s hope for the best in the coming months.
Latha: This is an industry is it an entire economy level thing that you are noticing or is it specific to some of your products?
A: It is an overall thing; it is not really specific to any products.
Latha: I am just wondering therefore whether we should expect other consumer and industrial companies to also lower their expectations from the second half. You would think that is possible?
A: I can only say that, because of our branding efforts and distribution enhancement we are definitely looking at a continued increase in market share even during this period.
Sonia: You have seen a higher amount of ad spends in the quarter gone by. With the slow down in demand do you think you will have to increase ad spends and would that put pressure on margins just in the near term?
A: Our product is such where the sales are not dependent upon the amount of ads that we come out with. It is not really impromptu kind of a demand or an impulse kind of a buying. It is more related with the fact that we want to continue to build a brand for all our product categories and that there is a long-term strategy in brand building than a quarter oriented strategy in brand building.

Nestle invests more in skin care strategy with 10 research centersNestle invests more in skin care strategy with 10 research centers
Reuters

Dec 11:  
Nestle on Thursday will announce plans to open 10 skin care research centers worldwide, deepening its investment in a faster-growing market for healthcare products.
The Swiss company, known globally for its chocolate bars, baby food and coffee, signalled a heightened interest in skin care earlier this year. It spent $5.7 billion for the rights to some injectable wrinkle treatments of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and for L'Oreal's share of a dermatology joint venture the two operated.
Nestle is also spending about $350 million on dermatology research and development this year, said Humberto Antunes, chief executive of Nestle Skin Care.
The first of the new research hubs, dubbed Nestle Skin Health Investigation, Education and Longevity Development (SHIELD) centers, will open mid 2015 in New York, followed by Hong Kong and Sao Paolo, and later others in North America, Asia and Europe, Nestle said.
Antunes likened the centers to "a theme park" for scientists, academics and other experts in skin health.
"What we aspire to do is create an environment that is multi-disciplinary," Antunes said. "We're going to put (known technologies) together so that we can discover new approaches to caring for the health of people."
Nestle knows skin health will be a growth market, "certainly faster growing and more profitable than packaged foods and drinks," Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said. "But no one knows how it is really going to shape up."
Nestle's skin care push puts it into competition with big spending industry veterans such as Allergan, the maker of Botox anti-wrinkle treatments, and Johnson & Johnson, which sells Neutrogena products.
Long term, Nestle expects 40 percent of its skin care business to be prescription drugs, with the rest divided between over-the-counter products, such as sunscreens, and aesthetic lines, such as wrinkle treatments.
"The advantage of having a large company (Nestle) investing in this space is that they can dedicate funding into R&D and targeted therapies," said Dr. Joshua Zeichner, assistant professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.
The initiative is being launched in partnership with the Global Coalition on Aging (GCOA), a consortium that includes companies such as Intel and Bank of America. The group will promote skin health needs for a global population expected to include more than 1 billion people over age 60 by 2020.
Nestle, which is funding the effort, declined to say how much money it will pump into SHIELD centers. It will claim any new products that come out of the initiative that fit within its areas of interest, while others may be turned over to other companies to develop.

Balyan steers Petronet with innovative solutionsAnilesh S Mahajan      Follow @anileshmahajan    Edition: Dec 21, 2014

Energy is what drives Ashok Kumar Balyan. The 63-year-old has spent a lifetime dealing with oil and gas. The CEO of Petronet LNG (PLL), the country's biggest gas importer, has luck on his side, too. His tenure, which started in 2010, has coincided with the country moving towards greener fuel, and the global gas prices calming down.
"There is demand for more gas. And I see it only growing in the days to come," says Balyan. India imported 49 mmcmd (million metric cubic metre per day) gas in 2013/14. The country's demand for gas was 242.66 mmcmd in 2012/13, and is projected to grow to 378.06 mmcmd by 2016/17, according to petroleum ministry documents. The domestic gas supply remained stagnant at around 110 mmcmd in the last four years, especially after the fall in production at Krishna-Godavari D6 basin. Given this scenario, the pie of imported gas is only expected to grow. Various gas trade tracking agencies expect India's import of gas to touch 143 mmcmd by the end of 2016/17.
About AK Balyan
The LNG prices have been dropping consistently. The spot LNG for December delivery to Asia (Japan-Korea Marker) has plunged by 29.4 per cent, according to energy tracker Platts. Indian imports are approximately $3 to $4 per unit cheaper than this marker. The average price quoted on this marker for December delivery is $12.5 per mmBtu.
"At current prices, the gas imported from any corner of the world is competitive in Indian market," says Balyan. "GAIL has committed imports from the US, Petronet imports from Australia. All we need is good import facility and pipeline network," he adds. The imported gas accounts for 25 per cent in the gas pool account, and PLL's market share in this is more than 66 per cent. The import capacity of the country is 22.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), out of which PLL has 15 mtpa.
IN PICTURES: India's Best CEOs 2014
On his recent visit Down Under, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed that he foresees India as a gas-based economy. So at a time when the country's gas production is increasing at a snail's pace, the role of Balyan becomes vital.
And he has stiff competition. Most of PLL's principal promoters, ONGC, BPCL, IOCL and GAIL, have plans in LNG business. ONGC, along with BPCL, has already got clearances for setting up a 3 mtpa import capacity at Mangalore and IOCL has plans to set up a 2.5 mtpa unit near Chennai. Shell, GSPC and Adani Group are also keen on this business. "The cake is increasing, so will our pie. But we don't know how serious these players are," says Balyan. He understands that most of his PSU counterparts would require PLL expertise in setting up their facilities. In the past, PLL assisted GAIL to commission the latter's port and facility at Dabhol.
Meanwhile, the NDA government at the centre is working out a policy to pool the imported and cheaper domestic gas. The policy may allow consumers to pay a levellised price of gas. Balyan, who is part of the initial consultations, says the policy will ensure increasing demand in the market. Right now, he is busy strengthening Petronet's reach and tackling glitches. For instance, the Gangavaram project in Andhra Pradesh, which faced delay in clearances because of political uncertainty, is now clear of all road blocks.
Meanwhile, Petronet is facing delivery challenges at the newly commissioned Kochi LNG terminal, where it could utilise only two per cent of its 5 mtpa capacity. Reason: GAIL, which has a mandate to lay pipelines there, is facing challenges from farmers who cite their first right of use. Undeterred, Balyan came up with an innovative business model.
PROFILES: India's Gladiators
Petronet LNG leased out the storage capacity in Kochi to UK's BG Group. "They will just have to pay for the storage," says Balyan. "Kochi port is in SEZ area, and gives leverage on taxes. Which makes this business lucrative for us and the partners."
"The gas is available in the international market. There is huge demand for this greener fuel in the country. This means that we just have to figure out good business models to leverage the current scenario. In the last few years we are focusing on this," says Balyan. PLL's unit in Dahej allows its customers to use the facility to import and process the gas, other than using only the conventional method of sourcing from PLL.
The other nominees: Oil & Gas (Mid-sized companies)
So the fortunes of Petronet are inextricably linked to Balyan's skills. He joined as CEO of Petronet LNG after working in ONGC for over 34 years, where he grew to be director of HR division and served on the boards of several subsidiaries. ONGC relied on Balyan, when it chose to diversify into the utilisation of alternative energy. "He was very active, an excellent manager and had a special knack of understanding commercial aspects," says his former boss R.S. Sharma, who was part of the panel that roped in Balyan in PLL. Narendra Taneja, national convener of BJP's Energy Cell, describes Balyan as an innovative business leader. "He has taken Petronet LNG to new heights."
Never one to rest on laurels, Balyan is busy expanding the company's capacity. Petronet LNG has a 10 mtpa import and storage unit at Dahej in Gujarat and another 5 mtpa capacity at Kochi. Balyan got the go ahead to expand Dahej's capacity to 17.5 mtpa by 2019. "Dahej has four storage tanks and two more are being built as part of the expansion," explains Balyan. Dahej, with an incremental project cost of Rs 1,000 crore, will be Asia's largest import facility. Given his track record, Balyan may well deliver on this promise, too.

award and prize
“Satyarthi and Yousafzai are precisely the people whom Alfred Nobel in his will calls ‘champions of peace’," chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee Thorbjorn Jagland said
Kailash Satyarthi of India and Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan on Wednesday received the Nobel Peace Prize for 2014 for their pioneering work on promoting child rights in the subcontinent, as they made an impassioned plea to globalise compassion.
“Satyarthi and Yousafzai are precisely the people whom Alfred Nobel in his will calls ‘champions of peace’,” chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee Thorbjorn Jagland said in his speech before awarding them the prestigious prize in Oslo.
“A young girl and a somewhat older man, one from Pakistan and one from India, one Muslim, the other Hindu; both symbols of what the world needs: more unity. Fraternity between the nations!,” he added.
Mr. Jagland said that violence and repression cannot be justified in any religion. “Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism protect life and cannot be used to take lives,” he said.
Mr. Satyarthi, who gave up his job as an electrical engineer to run an NGO for rescuing children from forced labour and trafficking, said: “I refuse to accept that the world is so poor, when just one week of global military expenditure is enough to bring all of our children into classrooms.”
“I refuse to accept that the shackles of slavery can ever be... stronger than the quest for freedom,” said 60-year-old Mr. Satyarthi, who asked the audience to feel the child inside them and globalise compassion.
The audience included King Harald V of Norway and Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani.
“Let us inculcate and transform the individuals’ compassion into a global movement. Let us globalise compassion. Not passive compassion, but transformative compassion that leads to justice, equality, and freedom,” Mr. Satyarthi said after receiving the award in Oslo at the ornate Oslo City Hall.
Invoking Mahatma Gandhi, he said, “If we are to teach real peace in this world... we shall have to begin with the children.” ‘I humbly add, let us unite the world through the compassion for our children.’
“I represent here the sound of silence. The cry of innocence. And, the face of invisibility. I have come here to share the voices and dreams of our children, our children, because they are all our children,” he said, adding that the crime against children has no place in a civilised society.
Mr. Satyarthi’s NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save Childhood Movement) prides itself on liberating over 80,000 children from bonded labour in factories and workshops across India.
Echoing his views, Mr. Satyarthi said, “All the great religions tell us to care for children. Jesus said: ‘Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to them.’ The Holy Quran says: ‘Kill not your children because of poverty.’
“I refuse to accept that all the temples and mosques and churches and prayer houses have no place for the dreams of our children,” he said.
“I challenge the passivity and pessimism surrounding our children. I challenge this culture of silence, this culture of neutrality,” he said and called upon all the governments, intergovernmental agencies, businesses, faith leaders, the civil society, and everyone to put an end to all forms of violence against children.
“Today, I see thousands of Mahatma Gandhis, Martin Luther Kings, and Nelson Mandelas marching forward and calling on us.
The boys and girls have joined. I have joined in. We ask you to join too,” he added.
According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) there are about 168 million child labourers globally. There are roughly 60 million child labourers in India alone.
Ms. Yousafzai became the youngest ever Nobel laureate.
In her speech, she said, “I am honoured to receive this award together with Kailash Satyarthi, who has been a champion of children’s rights for a long time. Twice as long, in fact, than I have been alive. I am also glad that we can stand together and show the world that an Indian and a Pakistani can be united in peace and together work for children’s rights.”
“This award is not just for me. It is for those forgotten children who want education. It is for those frightened children who want peace. It is for those voiceless children who want change,” she said in her acceptance speech.
“I am here to stand up for their rights, raise their voice...it is not time to pity them. It is time to take action so it becomes the last time that we see a child deprived of education,” she said.
Recalling her speech at the U.N., she said “One child, one teacher, one pen and one book can change the world.”
She dedicated the Nobel Prize money to the Malala Fund, to help give girls everywhere a quality education.
“The first place this funding will go is where my heart is, to build schools in Pakistan — especially in my home of Swat and Shangla,” she said.
She said Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa and Aung San Suu Kyi once stood on the same stage and hoped the steps that Satyarti and she has taken so far will also bring change — lasting change.
“It is not time to tell the leaders to realise how important education is — they already know it — their own children are in good schools. Now it is time to call them to take action. We ask the world leaders to unite and make education their top priority,” she added.
Mr. Satyarthi and 17-year-old Malala, who survived a near-fatal Taliban attack two years ago with determination advocating education for girls, were named by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee for the prestigious award on October 10.
They received the Nobel medal which is 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold and weighs around 175g.
They will share $1.1 million prize money.

SE Asian stocks down as oil prices hit energy sharesSE Asian stocks down as oil prices hit energy shares
Reuters
Tweet
Bangkok, Dec 11:  
Southeast Asian stock markets retreated on Thursday as investors cut positions in energy shares after global oil prices tumbled, sending the Thai benchmark to a more than six-week low and the Malaysian index down from the previous day’s rebound.
The Thai SET index traded about 2 per cent lower at 1,527.48, the lowest since October 22. Shares of the country’s top energy firm PTT fell 3 per cent and explorer PTT Exploration and Production dropped 5 per cent to the lowest since May 2009 after oil prices tumbled as much as 5 per cent on Wednesday.
“More downside could be in store for Thai stocks today amid external pressures, further slides in crude oil prices and heavy foreign sell-offs in both equities and futures last Tuesday,’’ strategists at broker Phillip Securities wrote in a report.
The overall performance of listed Thai firms was positive although concerns remained over the outlook of energy companies due to weak oil prices, Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) President Kesara Manchusree told reporters.
An overnight fall in US stocks broadly weighed on regional sentiment.
US stocks
US stocks lost more than 1 per cent on Wednesday in the S&P 500’s biggest decline since October 13 as another big drop in oil prices hammered energy shares.
Energy shares
Energy shares led among the losers on regional indexes after staging a rebound on the previous trading day.
In Kuala Lumpur, shares of Petronas Dagangan and Petronas Gas each dropped about 4 per cent, with Malaysia’s key stock index edging down 0.5 per cent after a 1.6 per cent rise on Wednesday.
In Singapore, shares of Keppel Corp and Sembcorp Industries reversed the gains made on Wednesday and were among the top percentage underperformers on the key Straits Times Index.
Broker NRA Capital expected more market weakness.
“Though many consider the selling to be overdone, the lack of support and buying interest will likely exaggerate the falls,’’ it said in a report.
The Philippine index fell 1.9 per cent to the lowest since October 20, led down by the shares of casino owner and operator Bloomberry Resorts Corp after a court ruling that allowed its erstwhile operator to sell 921.18 million shares.

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty plunge on global selloff; realty  auto stockshitBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai |
Posted: December 11, 2014 11:55 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 4:59 pm
After a day’s breather, Indian stocks continued their downslide today with benchmark Sensex tumbling 229.09 points to six-week low of 27,602.01 on sharp losses in RIL and ONGC after further drop in crude oil price.
Similarly, the 50-issue CNX Nifty of the NSE also plunged by 62.75 points, or 0.75 per cent, to end below 8,300-mark for the first time after one and half months at 8,292.90.
In line fall in local equities, the Indian rupee fell to nine-month low levels of 62.3 against the greenback.
Weak Asian trends on the back of overnight steep fall on Wall Street amid slow down in capital inflows weighed on the stock market sentiment here.
Besides Oil&Gas, realty, IT, power and banking counters also suffered heavy losses while only some of the defensive pharma stocks attracted some buying interest.
Besides RIL and ONGC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, TCS, Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Gail India suffered marked losses.
Brent crude oil fell to five-year low below USD 65 a barrel, putting pressure on oil companies.
The BSE 30-share barometer resumed lower on weak Asian cues and moved in negative terrain throughout the day before concluding at 27,602.01, a fall of 229.09 points or 0.82 per cent. This is its weakest close since 27,346.33 on October 30.
Yesterday, Sensex had snapped a three-day falling trend as it recovered by about 34.09 points or 0.12 per cent.
“Weak Asian markets and fresh fears from Euro region kept Indian markets volatile. Mixed sentiments on the back of weak rupee and lower oil too added to the volatility. FII liquidity outflow on the back of profit booking too added to weakness,” said Hiren Dhakan, Associate Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio.
Investors were also cautious ahead of the release of Consumer Price Index-based inflation and Index of Industrial Production scheduled on Friday.
A total 11 out of 12 BSE sectoral barometers ended in the red. Market breadth was weak as about 1,750 stocks fell, 1,139 rose and about 100 ended flat.
Bucking the overall weak trend, sugar stocks were in limelight after government fixed higher price for ethanol procurement by PSU oil firms.

US: CIA battles Senate Democrats over torturereportBy: Associated Press | Washington |
Posted: December 11, 2014 11:43 am
The CIA and several of its past leaders are stepping up a campaign to discredit a five-year Senate investigation into the CIA’s harrowing interrogation practices after 9/11, concerned that the historical record may define them as torturers instead of patriots and expose them to legal action around the world.
The Senate intelligence committee’s report doesn’t urge prosecution for wrongdoing, and the Justice Department has no interest in reopening a criminal probe.
But the threat to former interrogators and their superiors was underlined as a U.N. special investigator demanded those responsible for “systematic crimes” be brought to justice, and human rights groups pushed for the arrest of key CIA and Bush administration figures if they travel overseas.
Current and former CIA officials pushed back Wednesday, determined to paint the Senate report as a political stunt by Senate Democrats tarnishing a program that saved American lives.
It is a “one-sided study marred by errors of fact and interpretation- essentially a poorly done and partisan attack on the agency that has done the most to protect America,” former CIA directors George Tenet, Porter Goss and Michael Hayden wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece.
Hayden was singled out by Senate investigators for what they said was a string of misleading or outright false statements he gave in 2007 about the importance of the CIA’s brutal treatment of detainees in thwarting terrorist attacks.
He described the focus on him as “ironic on so many levels” as any wrongdoing predated his arrival at the CIA. “They were far too interested in yelling at me,” Hayden said in an email to The Associated Press.
The intelligence committee’s 500-page release concluded that the CIA inflicted suffering on al-Qaida prisoners beyond its legal authority and that none of the agency’s “enhanced interrogations” provided critical, life-saving intelligence.
It cited the CIA’s own records, documenting in detail how waterboarding and lesser-known techniques such as “rectal feeding” were actually employed.
The CIA is now in the uncomfortable position of defending itself publicly, given its basic mission to protect the country secretly. Its 136-page rebuttal suggests Senate Democrats searched through millions of documents to pull out only the evidence backing up predetermined conclusions.
“That’s like doing a crossword puzzle on Tuesday with Wednesday’s answer’s key,” the CIA said in an emailed statement.
Challenging one of the report’s most explosive arguments- that harsh interrogation techniques didn’t lead to Osama bin Laden- the CIA pointed to questioning of Ammar al-Baluchi, who revealed how an al-Qaida operative relayed messages to and from bin Laden after he departed Afghanistan.
Before then, the CIA said, it only knew that courier Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti interacted with bin Laden in 2001 when the al-Qaida leader was accessible to many of his followers. Al-Kuwaiti eventually led the continued…

Students to record effect of climate change via mobileappBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata |
Posted: December 11, 2014 11:39 am
Hundreds of students from the four cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad are coming together to document how climate change is impacting trees, birds and butterflies around them in urban areas. Using mobile applications as part of a citizen science project by Mumbai-based social enterprise Ladybird Environmental Consulting, they are trying to engage around 3,000 students across 40 schools in the cities.
With the help of WWF, they have tied up with ten schools in Kolkata whose students will click photographs and take notes on the changes they see in the urban bio-diversity landscape. For trees they would collect data on the pattern of the fall of their leaves, fruiting and flowering seasons – all indicators of the impact of climate change.
“All this information will be collated for a period of five years during which we will have substantial data to understand the impact of climate change in the four cities,” Dr V Shubhalaxmi, who has conceptualised the project, told PTI here. All the data and images collected would be uploaded by the students on the three apps – iBirds, iButterflies and iTrees – which would go live on Android devices from tomorrow.
Easy to find in cities, birds, butterflies and trees are known as indicators of climate change as they are among the most affected by any changes in the climate. West Bengal Biodiversity Board’s chairman Dr Ashok Sanyal said Kolkata alone has around 89 species of butterflies, 400 types of plants and 40 species of birds.
“We need to conserve our biodiversity as it is disappearing fast,” he said. Besides school students, the mobile app would also be useful for anyone interested in connecting with nature. It would have all details and photographs to help a mobile user identify 50 common species of birds, butterflies and trees.
Schools participating in the ‘Urban iNaturewatch Challenge’ have made it a part of their students’ project work asking students to give one hour every week in exploring nature around them. Students would work either during nature trails within the city or explore biodiversity near their school or home.
As students are not allowed to carry mobiles in school campuses, the teachers would help them with a device dedicated for the project. Although amateurs would generate the primary data using the app but it would be validated only by experts. Shubhalaxmi, who has been working as a nature educator for many years, said the idea came to her after realising that the next generation learners are glued to technology and gadgets.
“No one wants to take field biology as a career. We want to nurture young talent through this initiative,” she said adding that the project aligns with UN’s Decade of Biodiversity (2011-2020).

Kerala s K M Mani booked in bar bribe scamKerala's K M Mani booked in bar bribe scam
Press Trust of India | Thiruvanthapuram Dec 11, 2014 11:51 AM IST
In a major embarrassment to the Congress-led UDF government in Kerala, state Finance Minister K M Mani was today booked by Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau in the bar bribe scam.
According to VACB sources, the case against Mani, who is Kerala Congress(M) supremo, was registered on the basis of statements given by some of those questioned by investigators as part of a preliminary inquiry into the allegation that he had taken a hefty sum as bribe from bar owners for decisions favourable to them.
As the next step, a special investigation team would be constituted by the VACB for a detailed investigation in the case which pertains to the allegation levelled by Biju Ramesh, working president of Kerala Bar Hotel Owners Association, about two months back.
The LDF leaders demanded resignation of Mani, who is away in New Delhi to attend a meeting of state Finance Ministers convened by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
But the second rung leaders of his party put up a brave face and said there was no need for him to quit simply because a case had been registered.
The scam rattled the Oommen Chandy Government with the LDF opposition latching on it to attack the ministry. Under pressure, the Government then ordered a 'quick verification' to ascertain whether there was sufficient ground to go in for a full-fledged probe.
The order was issued based on a letter given by Opposition Leader V S Achuthanandan, who demanded a probe into the matter.
VACB top brass had received legal advice that an FIR should be registered within 45 days of starting the preliminary probe in such cases
A seasoned player in Kerala politics, Mani has been minister in most of the UDF Governments since 1980s. His party KC(M) is the third largest component in the UDF with a sound support base in the Central Travancore region, especially among the Christian community.

Mumbai, Dec 9:  
Extending their previous session losses, the BSE benchmark Sensex tumbled to over one-month closing low of 322.39 points to 27,797.01 on heavy selling by funds and retail investors due to weak global cues after crude oil dropped to fresh five-year lows.
Similarly, the NSE index Nifty dropped 97.55 points to end at 8,340.70.
Brokers' comment
Brokers said sustained selling by participants in blue-chip stocks that recently logged gains and a weak trend in global markets after oil prices skidded to fresh five-year lows led to the fall in domestic markets.
Trading sentiment was also dampened after current account deficit widened to $10.1 billion, or 2.1 per cent of GDP, in July-September quarter of this fiscal, up from 1.2 per cent a year-ago.
Sectoral indices
All BSE sectoral indices ended significantly in the red with power, metal, India infrastructure and PSU indices leading the downtrend. Among them, power index fell the most by 2.75 per cent, followed by metal 2.71 per cent, capital goods 2.29 per cent and India infrastructure index 2.28 per cent.
Gainers, losers
Dr Reddy's (1.53%), Sun Pharma (1.46%), M&M (1.21%) and TCS (0.15%) were the only four Sensex gainers, while the major losers were SSLT (5.24%), ONGC (4.29%), Bharti Airtel (4.24%), Tata Power (4.21%) and NTPC (3.54%).
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth Rs 4,984.60 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from the stock exchange.
European markets
European shares extendéd their previous session's losses on Tuesday, mirroring weaker equities in the United States and Asia, with a further drop in oil prices to a five-year low seen hurting energy stocks.
Asian markets
Asian stocks were mostly lower following a decline on Wall Street, though the losses were minor. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 0.36 per cent.
Japan's Nikkei eased 0.47 per cent, but that follows a run of strong gains which took it to its highest since July 2007. Chinese shares have also been on a tear with the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen at levels last visited in 2011.
On Monday, the Dow had lost 0.59 per cent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.73 per cent and the Nasdaq 0.84 per cent.
Crude oil, gold
Brent crude slipped to its lowest in five years on Tuesday, dropping below $66 a barrel after plunging more than 4 per cent the day before on worries over a deepening supply glut.
Brent crude for January delivery was down 43 cents at $65.76 at 0257 GMT on Tuesday - its lowest since October 2009.
Gold gave up some of its overnight gains on Tuesday as the dollar recovered from losses and oil prices weakened, dampening the metal's appeal as a hedge.
Spot gold had slipped 0.2 per cent to $1,200.26 an ounce by 0036 GMT.

Jaitley to meet state finance ministers tomorrow on GSTNew Delhi, December 10, 2014

Jaitley to meet state finance ministers tomorrow on GST
PTI
macro economics
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will on Thursday meet his state counterparts to iron out the “challenges” in rolling out the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The meeting would “discuss some of the challenges that the states see at this point of time”, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha told reporters on the sidelines of Delhi Economics Conclave here on Wednesday.
“On GST we are working on variety of discussions with the states. The legislative aspects of the GST are complicated, they have to be approved by the states. CST compensation is one of the item, which is under discussion,” he said.
The Centre is working towards rolling out the GST from April 1, 2016, and is in discussion with states to insulate their revenues from the impact of the GST.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT and local levies on the states front.
Mr. Sinha said once the issues are resolved the Centre can come up with the legislative calendar.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
States have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco be kept out of the purview of the GST.
The GST roll out has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the proposed new tax regime.
On easing restrictions on gold imports, Mr. Sinha said the intention of the government was to enable the jewellery sector function efficiently.
“The current account deficit and foreign exchange reserves are in much more comfortable position now. The rupee is stable,” Mr. Sinha added.
The CAD, which is the difference between inflow and outflow of foreign exchange, moderated to 1.9 per cent of GDP (USD 17.9 billion) in April-September period of current fiscal.
It was 3.1 per cent (USD 26.9 billion) in the corresponding period last year.
The government had last month scrapped the 80:20 scheme for gold imports under which at least 20 per cent of the imported gold had to be mandatorily exported before bringing in new lots.
Gold imports jumped 280 per cent to USD 4.17 billion in October, as per the latest trade data. The in-bound shipments touched 95 tonnes in September this year as against 12 tonnes a year ago.

Interest rate cut possible if inflation eases: RBI DyRate cut likely if inflation easing continues, says RBI Deputy SS Mundra

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor SS Mundra said on Wednesday the RBI would have room to cut interest rates if factors leading to lower inflation continue.
The comments come ahead of consumer inflation data due on Friday. The central bank held interest rates steady in its bi-monthly monetary policy review on December 2, but said it could ease key policy rates by early 2015.
Regarding niche banks, Mundra said RBI would grant licences to small and payment banks by March or April after releasing the final guidelines for applications in November.

Facebook is working on implementing artificial intelligence on the popular social networking site in a bid to protect its users from posting drunk messages and pictures that they might regret in the future.

He also said that the future artificial intelligence would be like an assistant that can say "Uh, this is being posted publicly. Are you sure you want your boss and your mother to see this?"
The technology would work by recognizing the difference between how users look like when they are sober and drunk.

UK stocks: FTSE falls for third day in a row as energy stocks slideTata Motors sales up 10 pct in December
Britain’s main equity index fell on Wednesday for a third consecutive day as a further drop in the price of oil hit energy stocks.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed down by 0.5 percent, or 29.43 points, at 6,500.04 points – its lowest closing level since early November.
Brent crude oil fell to a new five-year low below $65 a barrel on mounting signs of oversupply and lacklustre demand as global economic growth falters.
Oil and gas services group Petrofac fell 3.4 percent, making it the worst-performing FTSE stock in percentage terms, hit by the lower oil price and a downgrade from credit rating agency Moody’s.
Industrial equipment rental company Ashtead managed to buck the market, surging 9.1 percent and touching record highs after increased profits prompted it to raise its full-year earnings guidance.
The FTSE hit a peak of 6,904.86 points at the start of September, its highest level since early 2000, but slumped to 15-month lows in October on weak European economic data.
Beaufort Securities sales trader Basil Petrides said he would hold off buying the FTSE at present, given uncertainties generated by the oil price moves and political concerns in Greece. The Greek government will be forced to call early elections if its nominee does not win a presidential election in parliament.
“We had been going up since mid-October but we’ve now started to flatline. I wouldn’t buy it here. I’m going to pause and wait to see how things pan out,” said Petrides.
JNF Capital trader Rick Jones said he would look to buy into the FTSE if it fell below 6,500 points, on optimism the index is poised for a year-end rally often seen in stock markets that would push it back up to 6,800 points.

Muslim conversions in Agra: Opposition targets govt  FIR registered against RSSIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
The alleged forced reconversion of about 100 people to Hinduism in Agra set off a chorus of criticism against the government by the opposition inside and outside Parliament today even as an FIR was filed against an Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) wing behind the incident.
As the opposition parties called it illegal and demanded “strict” action, the government washed its hands off the issue, saying it had no role and that law and order is a state subject. They also demanded the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
Leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed the reconversion was voluntary and that it was not forcibly done.
In Agra, the Sadar Bazar Police registered the FIR late last night against Dharma Jagran Manch and its UP convener Nand Kishore and launched investigations into the incident.
Police registered cases under Section 153 (A) (promoting enmity between different groups) and Section 415 (using fraudulent means) of the IPC on a complaint by a person identified as Ismail, who was among those who was reconverted.
It has been alleged in the FIR that promises were held out by the organisers which included getting BPL cards and housing plots for those who embraced Hinduism.
Raising the issue in Rajya Sabha, BSP chief Mayawati alleged that RSS-affiliate Bajrang Dal converted some Muslim families to Hinduism in Agra by force and by allurement.
The Constitution, she said, guarantees religious freedom and that it was the responsibility of both the Centre and the state government to ensure safety of life, property and religion of all.
“The Government should take serious note of the Agra incident … strict action should be taken,” she said, warning that such forced conversions will create and breed communal tension in the country.
Forced conversions should be stopped, she demanded as members from Congress, Left, TMC and SP echoed her sentiments and shouted ‘Pradhan Mantri Jawab Do (Prime Minister reply)’.
Anand Sharma (Cong) said the government should be directed to give a clarification on the issue.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi informed the agitated members that an FIR has been filed by the Uttar Pradesh government on the issue.
“Action has to be taken by state government. Law and order is a state issue and the state government has to deal with it. Centre has no role in that,” he said. The reconversion issue also had its echo in the Lok Sabha.
Outside Parliament, CPI’s D Raja alleged that attempts are being made to impose the Hindutva agenda on everybody.
CPI-M leader Sitaram Yechury said this is the dirtiest of vote-bank politics being played by RSS and the BJP while former Union minister and Congress leader Veerappa Moily called it “anti- national”.
BJP leader Vinay Katiyar said that the consent of the participants was obtained before their re-conversion.
In UP, the Home Secretary Kamal Saxena said the state government has taken a serious view of the incident and has sent directives to respective district police chiefs to put their intelligence units on alert and check its recurrence.
Responding to questions about the issue of alleged re- conversion of some Muslims in Agra and similar plans in Aligarh, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, “We believe that in this great, grand country of ours, it is most unfortunate that the BJP is continuously taking up three-Cs to confuse, compound and create chaos and three-Ds to divert, digress and depart from real issues.”
He also urged the media to not allow the government to “deliberately divert” attention from the real issues.
Singhvi added that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and its Deputy Leader in Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, have already spoken on the issue.

Google News to go shut down in Spain over  Google TaxUpdated: December 11, 2014 09:52 IST
Google News to shut down in Spain over 'Google Tax'
AP
company information
Google said Thursday it will shut down its Google News service in Spain to prevent publishers’ content from appearing on it ahead of a new law requiring the Internet search company to pay Spanish news organizations for linked content or snippets of news.
The move marks the first time globally that Google Inc. will shutter Google News and comes ahead of a new Spanish intellectual property law going into effect Jan. 1 nicknamed the “Google Tax.”
The company’s News product for Spain will stop linking content from Spanish publishers and close on Dec. 16, Google said in a statement.
The law did not specify how much publishers would have to be paid by Google. Spain’s AEDE group of news publishers lobbied for the law nicknamed the “Google Tax” and Google said publishers would be forced to charge the company “for showing even the smallest snippets of their content whether they want to charge or not.”
“As Google News shows no ads and makes no revenue, this approach is simply unsustainable,” Google said.
Google News has long rankled newspaper publishers and other content providers who contend the service tramples on copyrights by creating a digital kiosk of headlines and story snippets gathered from other websites.
Most venting has been limited to criticism likening Google to a freeloader, but there have been attempts to force the company to change its ways through courts.
Google maintains it obeys all copyright laws while sending more people to websites highlighted in its News services. The company also allows publishers to prevent material from being displayed in Google News, an option few websites choose because the service is an important traffic source to sell ads.
After Germany revised copyright laws last year in a way that could have required Google News to make royalty payments, Google required publishers to give consent for summarizing content and most did.
Europe’s highest court this year ruled that people have a right to scrub unflattering or outdated information from Google’s search engine. That case started in Spain.

Jet up 80% in 2 wks | Spicejet tickets @50% price of rivalsJet Airways gains on SpiceJet woes, up 80% in 2 weeks

(Jet shares have soared 80%…)
MUMBAI: Jet Airways has been among the top performers on Dalal Street in the last two weeks as savvy investors bought the share amid troubles at rival Spicejet and due to declining fuel prices.
Jet shares have soared 80% since November 25, outpacing the BSE 500 index, on hopes the company would benefit from the recent mass flight cancellations by SpiceJet.
The BSE 500 index gained only marginally in the period. "Investors are reallocating their funds from SpiceJet to Jet Airways, while new investors are also buying the stock because it's the only airline company available in the listed space besides SpiceJet," said Mehraboon Irani, principal & head — private client group business at Nirmal Bang Securities.
SpiceJet shares have fallen 24% since December 1 when the troubles at the company erupted.
Analysts said lower aviation fuel prices, along with the fall in crude oil prices, would help Jet Airways improve its margins. Aviation fuel costs were around 38% of revenues for the half-year ended September.
"The fundamental factor for the share price to jump is the significant decline in crude prices, which are down 40% from peak," said Avinnash Gorakssakar, head of research at Miintdirect.com.
"In the short-term, as long as crude prices remain soft, the next couple of quarters will be much better in terms of EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation) margins."
Brent crude oil prices fell over 42% since June to a five-and-ahalf year low of around $66 a barrel on Tuesday.
Analysts and fund managers, however, warn a re-rating of the company is still some time away.
Jet Airways' revenues stood at Rs 17,301 crore for FY14, while losses were at Rs 3,667 crore. The company consolidated debt was Rs 10,577 crore as on March 31.
"We are not comfortable with airline companies as they have high debt on their balance sheets.
The sector is expected to benefit from lower crude prices but profitability of airlines still remains a big worry," said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer -equities at Kotak Mutual Fund .

India likely to improve economic growth to 6.3% in 2016: UNIndia likely to improve economic growth to 6.3% in 2016: UN
Press Trust of India | United Nations Dec 11, 2014 10:35 AM IST
India's economic growth is expected to improve to 6.3% in 2016 with the country leading economic recovery in South Asia, according to a United Nations report.
The UN World Economic Situation and Prospects 2015 (WESP) report, launched here yesterday, also said India is likely to make progress in implementing economic policy reforms and help provide support to business and consumer confidence.
It said global economic growth is forecast to continue increasing over the next two years, despite legacies from the financial crisis continuing to weigh on growth, and the emergence of new challenges, including geopolitical conflicts such as in Ukraine, and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
The global economy is expected to grow 3.1% in 2015 and 3.3% in 2016, compared with an estimated growth of 2.6% for 2014, when the pace of expansion has been moderate and uneven.
It said India, which is estimated to record a 5.4% economic growth in 2014, will see GDP growth improving to 5.9% next year and 6.3% in 2016.
Economic growth in South Asia is also set to gradually pick up from an estimated 4.9% in 2014 to 5.4% in 2015 and 5.7% in 2016.
"While the recovery will be led by India, which accounts for about 70% of regional output, other economies such as Bangladesh and Iran are also projected to see stronger growth in the forecast period," the report said.
The about 6% growth projected for India in 2016 will be the highest since the 2008-2011 period when it had grown at about 7.3%.
Economic growth had slowed to 4.7% in 2012, according to the UN report.
During 2014, East Asia, including China, managed to register relatively robust growth, while India led South Asia to a moderate strengthening.
Developing countries as a group are expected to grow at 4.8% in 2015 and 5.1% in 2016, up from the 4.3% estimated for 2014.
The report added that along with robust external demand, growth is expected to be underpinned by a moderate strengthening of domestic consumption and investment as countries benefit from improved macroeconomic conditions.
"Several countries, notably India, are likely to make progress in implementing economic policy reforms, thus providing support to business and consumer confidence," it said.

Infosys gets govt approval for tax centre contract extensionInfosys gets Cabinet approval for extension of tax centre contract
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 11:33 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The government on Wednesday approved the revised project cost and extension of contract for the Centralized Processing Centre (CPC) of the Income Tax (I-T) Department at Bangalore to Infosys by two years up to September 2017.
The proposal was approved by the Cabinet at a meeting.
"This would be after the end of the existing contract period on September 30th 2015 and for revision of the CPC project cost to Rs 1,078.59 crore," an official statement said after the Cabinet meeting.
The tax centre will help enable faster processing of returns and issue of refunds to the taxpayer's bank account directly without any interface with the I-T Department .
"This decision has significant benefits for the Department and taxpayers, including, better taxpayer services, savings in interest outgo, better recovery of outstanding tax payments , and freeing up departmental manpower for handling higher scrutiny and investigation work.
The decision will ensure horizontal equity by processing almost all returns filed by all categories of taxpayers across the country in a consistent, uniform, rule driven, identity blind manner. This will assure fairness in tax treatment to every taxpayer irrespective of their status," it added.
It also provides processing status updates and speedy communication using email, SMS and on the Tax Department website. The government said that the decision to extend the contract and revise the project cost "will ensure transparency and accountability".
"The proposal ensures the continuation of the Department's goal towards business transformation through technology. The CPC has enabled end to end automation of all processes within the Department using various innovative methods to provide taxpayer services and to promote voluntary compliance," the statement added.

US says no China-style climate deal with IndiaChina
("We don't have that kind…)
LIMA: The United States on Wednesday played down prospects for a wide-ranging deal with India to curb greenhouse gas emissions next year along the lines of a plan agreed to with China last month.
President Barack Obama will visit India in January at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . The visit has prompted speculation that the two nations might be preparing cooperation on climate change similar to a U.S. plan with Beijing.
"We don't have that kind of process going on with India," U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern told a news conference during Dec. 1-12 talks among 190 nations in Lima on ways to slow global warming.
Stern met with Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday. Javadekar told reporters he will have a second meeting with Stern on Thursday, as well as bilateral talks with Australia, Germany and Bolivia.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Lima on Thursday to underscore the U.S. commitment to a deal in Paris next year, without announcing new policies, a senior State Department official said.
China is the top greenhouse gas emitter, ahead of the United States, the European Union and India.
Under a joint U.S.-China announcement last month, the United States will cut its emissions by between 26 per cent and 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2025 and China agreed to cap its fast-rising emissions around 2030, its first peak.
China's per capita greenhouse gas emissions have surged in recent years to match average EU levels, while India's are below the world average.
That puts less pressure on India to cut emissions. "India is in a completely different economic situation from China," said Robert Stavins , director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program.
Javadekar said India should not rush to agree to things in Lima and that there is ample time to iron out the details of a final agreement in time for Paris in 2015.
"Let us not stretch it too far if there is something that is not agreed upon by all because there is one year to go," he said. "This is not the last opportunity."
He added that he wants to see more money pledged to support developing countries in their fight against climate change.
Javadekar said the fact that countries have surpassed a target of $10 billion in the Green Climate Fund in Lima is "happy news" because it finally signalled progress on the finance front in negotiations.
But he warned that some of what was raised is not new funding and that getting from that level to the longer-term UN goal to raise up to $100 billion per year for climate finance by 2020 will require an impossible leap.

Shares of  Havells India slipped as much as 6.95 percent intraday Thursday after brokerage UBS downgraded the stock to sell from neutral, citing rich valuations and elusive growth recovery.
The brokerage cut FY15 revenue growth guidance to around 12-14 percent from 17-20 percent earlier on weaker than expected demand recovery, after having a meeting with the company's management for getting business outlook.
The key message from the meet was a clear disconnect between growth expectations on the street and actual on-the-ground improvement, says the report.
The cut in FY15 revenue growth guidance implies likely growth moderation in 2HFY15 (October-March), says UBS, adding Sylvania 2H performance is also likely to be impacted by higher pension liabilities and forex volatility in Latin America.
Havells acquired lighting company Sylvania in 2007.
The brokerage feels elevated advertising spend and dealer incentives may cap EBITDA margins in next few quarters (versus around 500 basis points expansion in last 5 years), especially in light of increasing competitive intensity.
With more players foraying into the premium category, Havells ability to replicate the past margin expansion may not be easy going forward, says UBS.
The electrical equipment manufacturer's standalone core operating profit margin declined 120 basis points year-on-year to 13.2 percent during July-September quarter of FY15 while profit after tax slipped 4.9 percent Y-o-Y to Rs 119.61 crore during the quarter.
The brokerage thinks the company is moving in the right direction on its long term strategy through innovation led product portfolio expansion and targeting female centric ads to entrench its brand premium. However, with the growth differential versus peers narrowing down, UBS believes the near-term upside is capped, in the context of rich valuations.
The brokerage revised target price to Rs 295 on roll-forward to FY17E from Rs 270 earlier.
At 10:41 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 291.30, down Rs 19.30, or 6.21 percent on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

New Delhi: President Pranab Mukherjee will celebrate his birthday on Thursday with the launch of his book 'The Dramatic Decade: The Indira Gandhi Years'. The President has chronicled the fascinating decade of the 70's, including the crucial Emergency period, in his book which will begin online sales on Thursday.
Talking about his father's book, Sharmistha Mukherjee said, "Knowing my father, he will never drop a bombshell. He has got so much from his party and as his daughter no regrets that he didn't become prime minister."
She added that his father will not reveal everything, "My dad keeps a diary. He has given it to me but has scratched out some portions. He says some things will die with me."
#pranab mukherjee #sharmistha mukherjee #the dramatic decade: the indira gandhi years #congress
The book is published by Rupa Publications and in an official statement said, "The book focuses on one of the most fascinating periods in the life of this nation, the decade of the 1970s. This was when India found itself engaging with the true meaning of democracy. The nation displayed its commitment to liberty by extending full support to East Pakistan's struggle for Independence.
"Later, between 1975 and 1977, during the Emergency, India was grappling with the limits of personal expression. Finally, in 1977, the country saw the emergence of the politics of coalition, with the Janata Party," it added.
This was the time, the statement said, when Mukherjee committed himself to the role of a political activist. As a keen observer, Mukherjee recounts many episodes of this time.
The book will present a portrait of a complex nation.
In the past, Mukherjee has written books like "Midterm Poll", "Beyond Survival" and "Challenge Before the Nation

(It would recall an estimated…)
TOKYO: Honda Motor Co said on Thursday it would recall an estimated 400,000 vehicles globally as a precautionary measure to replace potentially deadly air bag inflators made by Takata Corp.
The recall follows a similar move by Toyota Motor Corp after an "unusual deployment" of a Takata-made inflator when a Toyota subcompact was scrapped in Japan last month.
A Honda spokeswoman said the automaker would need to set aside more reserves to pay for the latest recalls as well as the voluntary expansion globally of a region-specific recall limited to certain hot and humid areas in the United States.
She said she could not disclose a specific figure.
Subject to the latest recall are about 177,000 vehicles in Japan, including the Fit, Civic hybrid, CR-V, Accord and other models produced in 2003.
No injuries or accidents have been reported.
The rest of the recalls include about 22,000 vehicles in the Americas excluding the United States , 100,000 in Europe, 70,000 in Asia-Pacific. The 400,000 vehicle figure is a rough estimate, the spokeswoman said.

Tata Motors looks to co-develop cars with JLRPrices | Financials | Company Info | Reports
NEW DELHI: Tata Motors is looking at co-development of cars with the company's British luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover (JLR) as it works out strategies to turn around ailing operations. The company, which recently hired Maruti Suzuki veteran Mayank Pareek as the president of its 'passenger vehicles business unit, is also looking at reviving struggling volumes of Nano budget car, though plans to drive in a diesel version of the model have been put on hold.
Tata Motors is eyeing an ambitious comeback to the top 3 slot in the Indian passenger vehicle market and has lined up an aggressive product launch programme that includes driving in two new products every year till 2020. After introducing Zest sedan earlier this year, the company is now gearing up to get in Bolt hatchback with which it hopes to strengthen its offering in the big-volume compact car segment.
Tata Motors is also looking at retiring some of the older models, a process that Pareek dubs as "product rationalization". The company has many models which are struggling and have been around for years, and these could be withdrawn in coming years as Tata Motors modernizes its line-up and adds contemporary design to its portfolio.
"On a longer-term basis, co-development of cars (with Jaguar and Land Rover) can be looked at," Tim Leverton, president and head, advanced and product engineering at Tata Motors, told TOI. "We have studied this, and are looking at it. But, this is something which is in the future."
Leverton added that it is imperative to understand the positioning of the brands. "We have to remember that Tata Motors is focused on the mainstream mass market and not so much on the premium end, like the other two brands." The companies can also look at joint engine development in the future, though current level of engagement is in the technology sphere on areas like components, sensors, controls and software.

(Havells India Ltd falls…)
Havells India Ltd fell 7.48 per cent, adding to its 6.9 per cent slump on Wednesday after company cuts standalone revenue forecast to 12-14 per cent from 17-20 per cent, citing weak domestic demand, according to analysts
Significant pension liabilities was seen at unit Sylvania in due to drop in bond yields, analysts added.
At 11:29 a.m., the stock was trading at Rs 288.55, down 7.10 per cent or Rs 22.05 on the BSE.
Here is what the market expert Ambareesh Baliga says in a chat with ET Now. Excerpts:
ET Now: Havells have said that there are some issues with regard to meeting the sales guidance - they have cut it from 12% to 14% versus the earlier 17% to 20%. They are also talking about the possibility of pension liabilities in the second half which may impact reported profits. What do you make of these two key things and the kind of damage we have seen in the stock already?
Ambareesh Baliga: The issue with stocks like these is that over the last two years, they have actually built up a lot of expectations from analysts as well as investors and when this sort of a news comes in, it comes in as a shocker, because of which you are seeing this cut. This could deepen further because people were not expecting this sort of a news from Havells.
ET Now: What do you think in terms of a price level - how much would the stock get dented by in lieu of this revision in revenue?
Ambareesh Baliga: It is possible that we could see another 10% to 15% cut. This is just the beginning because once this sinks in, you could see a further cut.
ET Now: Do you think the stock would settle at roughly 250 odd in the selling?
Ambareesh Baliga: May not be 250, but possibly closer to about 275 or so. Those who have missed on the way up could actually come and start buying at those lower levels because in this rally - not just across Havells but across various other stocks - people have missed out. Thus, people sitting on the sidelines could actually come in to support at those lower levels.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Mofatraj Munot, chairman, Kalpataru Power Transmission said their margins will be better in FY15 on the back of completion of projects. The company is eyeing margins of around 10 percent for FY15.
Kalpataru Power’s order wins are seen at Rs 1,400 crore and the FY15 revenue growth around 14-15 percent. The company has secured order wins from  Cairn India and  GAIL of around Rs 140 crore each. Their current order book stands at Rs 5,000 crore, added Munot.
Below is verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: Give us a quick update with regards to what is going on in your business? Your L1 projects, at the end of Q1, were at around USD 16 billion, what is the current status?
A: We are L1 in about Rs 2,450 crore.
Q: In this year itself do you look to close out any of it?
A: We have already acquired Rs 1,500 crore in first half and we expect to reach up to Rs 4,500 crore.
Q: Have you won any new orders in the last one month because your earnings came out about a month back? Since then any big orders that Kalpataru Power has won?
A: Last six months, a lot of tenders were delayed and that is why we are L1 in many projects, most of them are overseas and Power Grid as well.
Q: Could you tell us about GMC’s revenues then, what do you expect the margins to be stable at around that 6-7 percent, what is the order book looking like with regard to GMC?
A: Order book is healthy, it is around Rs 5,000 crore and we expect to achieve the same turnover of the last year. The margin is going to improve slightly.
Q: What would be the reason for that improvement?
A: It would be on the back of the completion of the projects, most of our projects are nearing completion or completed.
Q: In the previous quarter you had order wins of about Rs 920 crore, what is the expected order win in the coming quarter in December and even in Q4?
A: In Q3 we must have got about Rs 1,400 crore. We expect to reach again Rs 5,500 crore overall.
Q: You were expected to scale up a couple of new businesses, that is with regards to railways, that has been a very exciting space over the last few months as well as the pipeline space, so could you give us some kind of update, has there anything new come with regards to both these two businesses?
A: As far as pipeline is concerned, we have secured two orders recently, one from Cairn and one from GAIL and we expect some more orders within this year.
Q: What is the size of the orders that you have got from Cairn as well as GAIL?
A: They are about Rs 140 crore each.
Q: What is the expected revenue growth in FY15 for the company as well as the margins?
A: Growth will be in the range of 14-15 percent and we will maintain that. The EBITDA will be around 10 percent.
Q: What about FY15, are the new orders that you are winning coming in at improved pricing? In FY16 can we see your margins improving from the current 10 percent?
A: Right now whatever we are getting is what we have quoted in the last three-four months. A lot of hope is there for the new tenders that are likely to come in next quarter or so and we hope that the price level will be little better than what it was earlier.
Q: Your guidance stands at 15 percent, there was a fear that it could be in the range of 12-15 percent and maybe at the low end of the guidance?
A: Roughly we will maintain 14-15 percent.
Q: I was also reading somewhere that the pending equity requirement in your road projects is about Rs 100 crore and partly it is on account of cost overrun, so is the company looking to infuse some equity to meet the shortfall?
A: No, we will be borrowing the required funds to meet the equity requirement.
Q: What about the GMC projects business because their revenues have been subdued, so what will be the revenue growth in GMC in FY15?
A: The revenue growth will be in the range of about 5 percent. We are more in a consolidation phase as far as GMC is concerned because a lot of infrastructure projects are not coming up so far and they are on a completion phase. We have a lot of building projects including a recent about Rs 900 crore one in Bangalore.

Air pollution discolouring Taj Mahal, finds study
73
0
Washington: A team of researchers from India and the US has found that the browning of the Taj Mahal's iconic marble dome and soaring minarets is due to dust and airborne carbon particles.
"Our team was able to show that the pollutants discolouring the Taj Mahal are particulate matter carbon from burning biomass and refuse, fossil fuels, and dust possibly from agriculture and road traffic," said Michael Bergin, professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US.
Attracting millions of visitors each year, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.
The researchers found particles of dust, brown organic carbon and black carbon in the filters and on the marble samples.
#taj mahal #carbon #dust #fossil fuels
Beginning in the 1970s, observers noted a brownish cast to the white marble that makes up the structures.
For the study, the researchers used air sampling equipment to measure what was in the air in the Taj Mahal complex from November 2011 through June 2012.
In addition, they also placed small samples of pristine marble onto the Taj Mahal at various locations near the main dome.
After exposure to air pollutants over a two-month period, the researchers found particles of dust, brown organic carbon and black carbon in the filters and on the marble samples.
The carbon particles come from a variety of sources, including fuel combustion, cooking and brick-making, trash and refuse burning and vehicle exhaust.
The dust may come from local agricultural activities and vehicular traffic - or from distant sources.
Now that researchers know what's discolouring the Taj Mahal, the next step will be to identify the sources of the particles and plan control strategies.
The sources could be local and the government has already taken steps to reduce vehicle and industrial emissions in the area or the particles could be coming from longer distances away from the region, the authors pointed out.
"Some of these particles are really bad for human health, so cleaning up the Taj Mahal could have a huge health benefit for people in the entire region," Bergin concluded.
In addition to Georgia Institute of Technology and University of Wisconsin in the US, researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur (IIT-K) and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) collaborated on the project.
The study appeared in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.

Goa faces prospect of falling tourist arrivals

Panaji: The Crimean crisis, Russia's falling rouble and stopping of tourist charter flights from international destinations might prove to be a dampener for the much-hyped New Year party scene in Goa this time, fear tourism industry experts.
While the ongoing St Francis Xavier exposition might to a certain extent off-set the impact of the decrease in tourist footfalls, the industry is not expecting many visitors to turn up for beach parties, which are tailor-made for New Year revellers.
The tourism industry's major backbone Russian travellers has been hit by falling rouble and sanctions on Russia due to Ukraine conflict.

"What we have heard is that the charter flights from Moscow will stop coming after January 15. The New Year is grim for us. There will be hardly any party scene," said Cruz Cardoso, President, Shack Owners Welfare Society, a union of beach shack operators in Goa.
The deserted shacks, thinning crowd on beaches, and stringent government rules extracting more taxes this year have made business inviable, according to him.
Cardoso fears that few shacks might wind up soon after the New Year due to lack of business.
He said majority of the total 350 beach shacks spread across the state are currently doing just 75 per cent of the expected business, and it may go further south in coming days.
Goa has been a major party destination attracting lakhs of tourists to usher in New Year.
The 105-km-long beachline turns into a party spot on the New Year eve, with night-long revelry planned for visitors.
"You might get domestic tourists from cities like Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad and other two-tier cities for the parties.
"But the season does not look promising. The hotel occupancies have remained low right from October this year. The only hope we see is in the form of Visa on Arrival facility extended to various countries. That too, the facility should function properly," said Ralf D Souza, a hospitality sector expert and spokesman for Tours and Travels Association of Goa (TTAG).

BSE begins work on risk-based supervision of brokersBSE begins work on risk-based supervision of brokers
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 12:10 PM IST
Leading stock exchange BSE has initiated a process of putting in place a new risk-based model for supervision of market entities including brokers, taking forward a new model proposed by regulator Sebi in this regard.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has decided to adopt this new supervision model, based on level of risks posed by a market entity, to help it better regulate the marketplace and strengthen its surveillance system.
"In order to implement the model, based on the Risk Assessment template formulated by SEBI and exchanges, BSE has initiated the process of developing the system.
"The system would comprise data generated by the Exchange as well as those provided by the members," the BSE said today, while adding that it will provide an electronic interface to the members to enable them submit the data, which will be collated and analysed by the exchange system.
The new model, derived from the global best practices, would follow four distinct steps - assessing the risk posed by a market entity, assigning 'risk and impact rating' to it, determining supervisory risk rating score and then adopting a suitable supervisory approach.
Various market entities would be divided broadly into four groups -- very low risk, low risk, medium risk and high risk -- and the quantum of surveillance and number of inspections would increase as per the risk level.
Risk and impact ratings would be assigned to each entity on a scale of 0-4, with zero rating being for those with completed absence of any risk parameters, and a score of four would indicate 'very high risk or very low compliance'.
The move would help the existing surveillance system take care of most of the smaller offences, so that the investigation resources are utilised more effectively to tackle serious violations in the market place.
The new model would follow four distinct steps -- assessing the risk posed by a market entity, assigning 'risk and impact rating' to it, determine the supervisory risk rating score and then adopt a suitable supervisory approach.
The overall risk profile of an entity would be decided by two factors -- business or activity specific risk and the impact risk arising out of default or failure.
The risk-based supervisory approach is being implemented in a phased manner.
Earlier in September, Chairman U K Sinha had told PTI that Sebi was working on this risk-based supervision model while becoming the first financial sector regulator in the country to have done a study of its own regulatory impact.
The Sebi chief had further said that specific metrics would be put in place to determine the risk that every firm poses to the system and based on which enforcement actions can also be initiated.

PM Modi meets President Putin with hopes of a new beginningPM Modi meets President Putin with hopes of a new beginning
Agencies | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 12:18 PM IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin today after the latter arrived in Delhi for a 2-day visit to attend the 15th India-Russia annual summit. The government hopes that the Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India would lead to new beginnings, which would enable Russian investors to utilize the opportunities that are opening up through the 'Make in India' initiative.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday also tweeted in Russian to welcome President Vladimir Putin. 
"Delighted to welcome President Putin to India! Looking forward to a productive visit that will take India-Russia ties to newer heights," Prime Minister Modi tweeted.
"The bond between the people of Russia and India is very strong. Our nations have stood by each other through thick and thin," he added.
"Times have changed, our friendship has not. Now, we want to take this relation to the next level and this visit is a step in that direction," the Prime Minister said in a series of Russian tweets.
"We hope this will lead to new beginnings which will enable Russian investors to utilize the opportunities that are opening up in India through Prime Minister's Make in India initiative and a variety of opportunities that have arisen. For example, Russia is amongst the largest producers of diamond. India is amongst the largest importers of diamond because we import them and then export polished diamonds," Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said ahead of the 15th annual summit interaction between President Putin and Prime Minister Modi.
"It is our intention during the discussions to try and see if a beginning can be made in terms of direct import of Russian diamonds to India. Should we succeed in this, this will add sparkle to India- Russia bilateral ties. And, as you know, diamonds are forever and the sparkle will last forever," he added.
Akbaruddin said the two countries have been time-tested friends and added that there existed enormous opportunities in furthering trade ties between the two nations.
"India and Russia have a fraternal relationship and have been time- tested friends. Therefore, when President Putin meets our leadership you can expect that he will be given a warm welcome."
"India and Russia's bilateral trade is approximately ten billion. This is of course way below its potential. There exists enormous opportunities in the changes that are taking place in India as well as in Russia for our businessmen to engage each other. As part of discussions today, we have a group of CEOs from Russia, as well as from India, to interact among themselves and with our leadership," he said.
The MEA spokesman added that the outcome from the talks would be fruitful and would be centered around defence, nuclear power plants and people to people ties.
"On the table are a variety of issues, in keeping with our multi- faceted relations. The agenda is expansive; it deals with energy ties that are in terms of hydro-carbons, where there is enormous potential; nuclear energy co-operation where India and Russia are working to build nuclear power plants in India; defence- which is a major factor in our bilateral ties and commercial and people to people ties which are growing very rapidly. So, we expect a full agenda and a fruitful outcome," he pointed out.
Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in New Delhi late last night on a two-day visit to India to attend the 15th India-Russia annual summit.
During his stay in the Indian capital, Putin will hold detailed talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, both in the restricted and delegation format, today.
Prime Minister Modi has welcomed President Putin, saying he is looking forward to a productive visit that will take India-Russia bilateral ties to newer heights.
He further said that the bond between the people of the two nations is very strong, and added that New Delhi is keen to take this relationship to the next level.
The India-Russia Annual Summit process was initiated under President Putin's leadership during his visit to India in October 2000.
This year's summit is expected to result in about 15 to 20 agreements in the fields of defence, nuclear energy, science and technology, space, customs among others.

Infosys founders to devote time  money on philanthropyInfosys founders to devote time, money on philanthropy
Fakir Balaji     Bengaluru   Last Updated: December 10, 2014  | 00:00 IST
Photo: Reuters
Three decades after floating and making Infosys a global software major, its founders led by NR Narayana Murthy are joining hands again - to promote philanthropy.
To fund philanthropic activities and encourage entrepreneurship, four of the seven original promoters and their family on Monday jointly sold off 32.6 million shares of Rs 5 face value in the blue-chip company.
"We sold a small portion of our shares to fund philanthropic activities and encourage entrepreneurship," Murthy told IANS, a day after informing the regulators about the sudden transaction through multiple deals.
Besides Murthy, two founders - Nandan Nilekani and K Dinesh, their family members, and the wife of the other founder SD Shibulal - sold the shares valued at Rs6,484 crore ($1.05 billion).
Murthy sold 400,000 shares, his wife (Sudha) 5,600,000, daughter (Akshata) 600,000, while Nilekani and his wife Rohini sold 6,000,000 each, Dinesh 700,000, his wife (Asha) 4,000,000 and his daughters (Deeksha and Divya) 750,260 each and Kumari Shibulal 2,400,000.
"As I am no longer associated with Infosys in official capacity, I intend to devote the rest of my life to philanthropy along with some of my old partners," the 68-year-old Murthy said, hinting he would continue to be active in his new phase of life.
Murthy, who returned from retirement June 1, 2013 to revive the $8.3-billion company's sagging fortunes, resigned a year later as its executive chairman and declined to be even chairman emeritus, a post he held since August 2011 on superannuation at the age of 65.
"I will, however, be associated with Infosys as a well-wisher and a small investor in the company though our family will continue to be the largest among retail shareholders," Murthy noted.
The dramatic appointment of renowned technocrat Vishal Sikka, a former executive board member of German software product firm SAP AG, as the outsourcing major's first non-founder chief executive from Aug 1 made Murthy to call it quits, cutting short his five-year tenure in his second innings.
"I decided to exit a year after my return to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities to the new management and give a free hand to Sikka for steering the company into the future as a marquee Indian brand in the tech space," Murthy said.
Murthy, however, remained the non-executive chairman from June 15 to October 11. "I have immense confidence in the future of Infosys and its leadership.
"We took the company's market value from Rs 28.5 crore when it was listed in 1993 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) to Rs 200,000 crore in 2014, with an astronomical return of 650,000 per cent over 21 years - a CAGR of 89 per cent," Murthy added.
Philanthropy is not new to the promoters or their company.
They have been discharging corporate social responsibility (CSR) through various activities since inception in 1981 and had set up in 2009 Infosys Science Foundation, a not-for-profit trust, with Rs100-crore corpus to honour outstanding achievements of researchers and scientists every year, with Rs55-lakh cash prize each in six categories, including engineering and computer science, life sciences and humanities.
"It is important for founders to move from being founders, to founder managers to investoRs This will allow the creation of larger, more competitive board managed companies," former Infosys board member TV Mohandas Pai told IANS.
Observing that how they (co-founders) use the money for investment or philanthropy was their personal choice and not for him or others to speculate, Pai said their move would augur well for India and inspire many more to tread the same path.
Pai, currently chairman of the Manipal Global Education, was also head of Infosys' administration, education and research, financial, human resources and its leadership institute at Mysuru, about 150 km from here.
Echoing Pai, former Infosys board member and chief financial officer V Balakrishnan said the co-founders, led by Murthy, had shown to the country that capitalism and compassion can exist together and thrive.
"They (co-promoters) not only created wealth legally and ethically but also used it to address the basic needs of the society to improve healthcare, sanitation, education. Their philanthropic initiatives will go a long way to address the basic structural issues for the needy in our country," Balakrishnan told IANS.
Lauding the co-founders for dedicating to philanthropy, Sikka said they have reiterated their commitment to the future of the company and reinforced their belief in and support of its leadership.

Vikram Akulas big dream is now for a small bankVikram Akula’s big dream is now for a small bank
Satyanarayan Iyer
The former poster boy of microfinance is keen to make a comeback in the financial inclusion space
Mumbai, Dec 10:  
Vikram Akula, once the poster boy of the microfinance industry in India and founder-chairman of SKS Microfinance, is seeking to make a comeback in the financial inclusion space.
Akula has acquired a 26 per cent stake in Vaya Finserv Pvt Ltd for an undisclosed sum. The Hyderabad-based start-up is likely to apply for a small-bank licence to the RBI. Vaya Finserv provides business correspondent services and acts as a link between banks and rural customers by taking banking services to the customers’ doorstep for a small fee.
Akula, who is currently in India, says financial inclusion is his passion.
If given a licence, Akula says he intends to take financial inclusion to the under-banked regions. After his stint with SKS Microfinance ended on a sour note, Akula has spent much of his time in New York. Akula’s three-year non-compete agreement with SKS ended this November.
After more than a decade at the helm, Akula exited SKS in November 2011 due to differences with the management. He ‘voluntarily' stepped down amidst controversies on the direction of the company, corporate governance issues, mounting bad loans, low recoveries and rising losses.
His bid to comeback to SKS Microfinance proved unsuccessful last year when a majority of shareholders opposed it. “I have been helping other social-entrepreneurs by mentoring them and holding workshops for them,” he says about the past three years in New York. If Vaya is granted a small-bank licence, Akula says he will play a mentoring and non-executive role in the company. He intends to stay on in New York, primarily because of family commitments.
Asked about the potential candidates to head the bank, Akula said, “For leading the small-bank, it will have to be one of the bankers coming out of the mainstream banking sector. We have identified a few.”
On the lessons from the SKS Microfinance experience, he says, “We want growth…we need growth but the lesson is to do it in a systematic and measured way.”

JSPL Concerned Over Shortage of Raw Material for Steel Plant
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 11, 2014 00:26 (IST)
Tata Motors Sales Rise 10% in December
Bhubaneswar: A fortnight after dropping plans to set up a Rs 60,000-crore coal-to-liquid project in Odisha, Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) on Wednesday voiced concerns over raw material shortage for its steel plant in Angul and sought iron ore linkage for the unit.
"The Angul unit of JSPL has a steel making capacity of 2.5 mtpa at present, but raw material is a major problem. We are facing acute shortage of iron ore," JSPL chairman Naveen Jindal told reporters here.
Mr Jindal, who met Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Chief Secretary G C Pati and other top officials, said the company was even thinking of importing raw material.
"It will be unfortunate if iron ore is imported for a steel plant in a mineral rich state like Odisha," he said.
While the JSPL plant at Angul was now running at 2.5 mtpa capacity, it would achieve 6 mtpa capacity soon. The company now requires 5 million tonnes of iron ore for its operation. In the long, after completion of its 6 mtpa steel plant, it would be annually requiring 12 to 14 mtpa of iron ore for its operation.
Mr Jindal said Indian Steel Association and those who have invested in Odisha would apprise the state government about raw material crunch to find a lasting solution.
Seeking steps to raise iron ore production, the JSPL chairman said the state government would also get around Rs 1,000 crore additional royalty.
If adequate iron ore was not available, the Indian steel industry would lose edge in competition, he said.
Mr Jindal, who apprised the Chief Minister about the status of the Angul project, said while iron ore price in India had gone up, cheap steel from countries like China had posed a major challenge for Indian steel sector.
He said JSPL would participate in the next auction of deallocated coal blocks by the government.
Contrary to traditional blast furnace route, which operates on coking coal, mostly imported, the Gas based DRI route steel plant in Angul was based on non-coking  coal, which is available in plenty in Odisha and elsewhere in India, company sources said.
On account of coal block cancellation, the CTL project was uncertain, Jindal said adding "clarity is not there now".
JSPL had last month said it had scrapped plans to set up the $10 billion CTL project at Angul in Odisha following the recent cancellation of Ramchandi mines by the Supreme Court.
Mr Jindal said the company was getting full support and cooperation from the Odisha government.

Putin to meet Modi today; to boost energy  trade tiesPutin backs Make In India with copter, nuclear deals
Jayanth Jacob , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 11, 2014
First Published: 10:47 IST(11/12/2014) | Last Updated: 01:33 IST(12/12/2014)

Russia offered to help India set up at least 10 more nuclear reactors and manufacture light-utility helicopters  in line with the Make in India campaign as the two countries stepped up their defence and strategic partnership during President Vladimir Putin’s visit on Thursday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Russia would remain India’s most important defence partner and its “unique place in India’s foreign policy will not change” as he laid out a roadmap for stronger energy and business ties between New Delhi and Moscow at their 15th annual summit.
As India and Russia sought to strengthen a once-close relationship, the two countries signed 20 agreements including a contract to implement the third and fourth reactors of the Kudankulam nuclear power plant and a joint investment fund of $1 billion for Indian infrastructure and hydroelectric projects. Other strategic deals covered oil supply, infrastructure and an increase in direct diamond sales to India by Russian firm Alrosa.
Both nations team up to help Afghanistan, eradicate terrorism
“Even as India’s options have increased today, Russia will remain our most important defence partner,” Modi said after the summit. “Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters. It includes the possibility of exports from India. We will follow up on this quickly.”
HT was the first to report that Russia would join Modi’s first big-ticket ‘Make in India’ initiative in the defence sector.
The agreements reflected Russia’s need for allies in the face of Western sanctions over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Though India’s defence cooperation with other countries is expanding, 60% of defence purchases still come from Russia. However, India plans to bring down its dependence on foreign vendors and increase indigenisation of the defence sector as part of the Modi government’s Make in India initiative.
For the chopper deal, public sector unit Hindustan Aeronautics Limited or an Indian private firm could partner for the production of Kamov 226 T helicopters in India as bidding for these reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters is restricted for Indian firms and their joint ventures.
In the first phase, the order could be for 384 helicopters, which could subsequently be increased to 600 to replace the ailing Cheetah/Chetak fleet used by the Indian Army and air force.
The total cost of the project is expected to be over $3 billion.
Modi has also proposed that Russia should manufacture spares and components of Russian defence equipment, a request Putin responded to positively.
Like the defence sector, Russia also aligned nuclear cooperation with Make in India as the two leaders unveiled an ambitious nuclear energy plan to build at least 10 reactors. “It will also include manufacture of equipment and components in India. This also supports our Make in India policy,” Modi said. “Our partnership and the strong sensitivity that we have always had for each other’s interests will be a source of strength to both countries,” the Prime Minister said.
Putin said Russia could eventually supply India with 20 nuclear reactors.
“We highly appreciate the friendship, trust and mutual understanding with Indian partners,” said Putin.

Agra conversion row: Muslim groups demand action and protectionComments
Islamic organisations took to the streets on Wednesday protesting the alleged forced conversion of 57 Muslim families to Hinduism and demanding protection to vulnerable members of the community.
A meeting was held at Mantola, a Muslim-majority area, where protesters blocked the main road running through it.
Leaders and clerics cautioned the district administration to impose strict checks on people loyal to hard-line Hindu outfits such as the Bajrang Dal.
Mufti Abdul Khubeb Rumi condemned the alleged trickery used by organisers of Monday’s conversion camp to lure poor Muslim families into it with the promise of ration cards and other doles.
He said those involved in wrongful deeds must be brought to book but appealed to Muslims to adopt “peaceful measures to counter notorious elements indulging in conversions”.
The mufti said these families would continue to be Muslim despite their conversion because there’s no need for a re-entry into Islam.
“There had been queries regarding the religious status of these 57 families. These Muslims have denied being converted to Hinduism and so they continue to be Muslim.”
Cleric Syed Ikhtiyar Jafri echoed the mufti’s views. “Any conversion made under force or forgery is no conversion. It is matter of belief and once they stated that they haven’t switched to Hinduism, there is no need for them to follow any formal ritual to return to Islam.”
Haji Jamiluddin Qureshi, president of the Rashtriya Sarvdaliya Muslim Action Committee, held the the Narendra Modi government responsible for not restraining groups like the Bajrang Dal from fomenting trouble. “Such incidents have created an atmosphere of fear among Muslims and sparked communalism. Bajrang Dal people intend to disturb the peace and harmony.”
Later, the protesters submitted a memorandum to the additional district magistrate and the superintendent of police. SP Sameer Saurabh said forces were stationed at sensitive places.

All you wanted to know about NEVS  Mahindra s latest acquisition targetAll you wanted to know about NEVS, Mahindra's latest acquisition target
Swaraj Baggonkar | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 10:56 AM IST
Utility and tractor manufacturer Mahindra & Mahindra has put in a bid to acquire a stake in troubled Swedish company National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS). Here is all you wanted to know about NEVS:
 
Swedish car maker Saab Automobile AB, formed in 1945, is one of Scandinavia’s best known industrial brands. It began as a manufacturer of small cars mainly for the European markets. 
US auto giant General Motors, which already had series of car brands in its kitty, bought 50% stake in Saab in 1989, only to make it a 100% subsidiary 21 years later through purchase of the remaining stake. 
ALSO READ:  M&M said to be in talks to buy stake in Swedish firm
 
It separated its auto business from Saab AB’s aerospace operations in 1990. Saab’s Grippen was one the bidders for the multi-billion contract to supply fighter jets to the Indian Air Force. 
Despite its distinctive brand and a loyal fanbase, Saab struggled against bigger competition, failing to tap growth opportunities especially in the emerging markets. 
Unable to turn around operations, GM exited the company in 2010, selling it to Dutch automobile maker Spyker Cars NV. M&M was also believed to be in the race to buy Saab less than a year after it acquired another struggling company SsangYong Motor Company of Korea. 
Meanwhile, the troubles of Saab never ceased to exist. The company struggled to avoid insolvency throughout 2011 following which it filed for bankruptcy the same year.
Its sale to a Chinese consortium the same year was blocked by GM, which opposed the transfer of technology and production rights to the Chinese company. 
In 2012, another Chinese-Japanese consortium formed a new company called NEVS after buying the business assets of Saab. Led by a Chinese businessman Kai Johan Jiang, NEVS aimed at positioning itself as an electric car maker that also made gasoline and diesel cars. 
Plans were afoot to have a fully electric version of the sedan powered by lithium-ion batteries imported from a company in China. China was also the main market for NEVS whose promoters view it as a big electric vehicle market. GM in between objected to the use of Saab brand name.  
After being under prolonged shutdown, the first Saab car by NEVS, a gasoline-powered 9-3, rolled out of the production line only by the end of 2013. Earlier this year, NEVS sought protection from its creditors after struggling to be on target to deliver 120,000 cars a year by 2016. 
A Swedish court granted permission to carry out reorganization of the company, which was later extended by three more months after NEVS petitioned that it was in talks with couple of vehicle manufacturers for a sell-out. 
In addition to M&M, China’s Donfeng Motor Corp is believed to have evinced interest in buying NEVS. But promoters of the Swedish company are believed to have chosen the Indian company over the Chinese one.

R Athmaram, ED,  Bank of Maharashtra in an interview to CNBC-TV18 spoke about the reason for the base rate cut taken by the bank.
The bank has cut base rate by 15 basis points to 10.25% with effect from December. Athmaram said with 20 of 26 PSU banks having cut base rate to 10.25 percent from 10.4 percent, their bank also decided to do so to be competitive in the market.
However, he does not see any further cuts in base rates or deposit rates immediately.
Answering a query on capital raising, he said there would be a likelihood of a follow on public offer (FPO) in the next fiscal but not immediately unless the government forces them to do so. Currently, the CRAR for the bank stands at 11 percent.
Below is the transcript of R Athmaram’s interview with Latha Venkatesh on CNBC-TV18.
Q: What triggered this rate cut? Have you all already cut your deposit rates? Where do they stand?
A: What happened in the month of April we worked out the base rate and at that point of time our base rate was much higher than the other peer group banks. So, we have been getting feedback from the field also that the base rate is on the higher side.
Latha: How do you compare with other banks predominantly in western India like Bank of Baroda or Bank of India?
A: Almost 20 out of the 26 public sector banks today have a base rate of 10.25 percent. So, we were a bit off-the-mark, so with this reduction we are now inline. Now this is the second half of the financial year, we really expect the credit growth to take off in a big way and so we did not wish to be non-competitive in the market and create problems for us.
Latha: Do you expect a further cut in base rates or in deposit rates?
A: Deposit rates also we had reduced, earlier we we had it around 9-9.02 percent and now we have brought it down to 8.75 percent.
Latha: Are you expecting a further cut in either deposit rates or in base rate?
A: Further cut immediately may not be possible.
Latha: I am not asking base rate I am asking deposits. Do you see them falling further?
A: Deposit rates I do not think we will be able to cut further because as you know already it is very sluggish both the deposit growths as well as credit growths are sluggish. So, we need to keep our term repo rate at least in the retail segment attractive to have a good mix of term repo rate.

Madras HC notice on DBTL stokes fear of judicial backlash once againAadhaar-based cash transfers: Madras HC notice stokes fear of judicial backlash
Sudheer Pal Singh | New Delhi Dec 12, 2014 12:45 AM IST
The fear of a judicial backlash against the government’s attempt to revive the Aadhaar-linked direct benefits transfer of LPG (DBTL) subsidy returned on Wednesday, with a division Bench of the Madras High Court issuing notices to the cabinet secretary, petroleum secretary and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) chairman in this regard.
A public interest suit was filed in the Madurai bench of the court, challenging the central government’s move to link Aadhaar and bank account details with domestic gas cylinder connections, as part of the DBT scheme. The petitioner, Sivakasi-based advocate S M Anantha Murugan, called for restraining the scheme as the Supreme Court had earlier restrained oil companies from demanding Aadhaar card numbers for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders.
Business Standard had on October 28 reported that Solicitor-General Ranjit Kumar had advised against resuming cash transfers in cooking gas without taking the Supreme Court’s approval. The government should first place the report of a committee appointed to study the scheme before the court and seek a modification in its ruling, he had advised. A senior petroleum ministry official had recently said the ministry would approach the court if the need arose. An earlier version of the scheme was rolled out by the previous government in June last year which had to be stopped after the Supreme Court observed Aadhaar numbers could not be made mandatory for availing of benefits from the government. The scheme had already been rolled out in 292 districts by then and the government had transacted via Aadhaar about Rs 5,000 crore to beneficiaries.
A modified version of the DBT scheme was launched by the new government in 54 districts across 11 states, covering 23.3 million households, on November 15, to reduce diversion of subsidised domestic cooking gas. The new scheme does not make an Aadhaar number mandatory. Currently, the Aadhaar generation level in the 54 chosen districts stands at 95 per cent. Under the new scheme, consumers without Aadhaar numbers can receive cash directly in their bank accounts. However, they may have to shift to an Aadhaar-based cash transfer system when they get their Aadhaar numbers. Also, consumers not cash transfer-compliant (CTC) get a three-month grace period, during which they receive the cylinders at a subsidised rate.
To ensure LPG consumers have extra cash to pay for the first LPG cylinder at market price, a permanent advance is to be paid to them as soon as they make their first cylinder booking after joining the scheme.

US co-opted Cubas hip-hop scene to sparkchangeBy: Associated Press | Havana |
Posted: December 11, 2014 12:41 pm
In early 2009, a U.S. government contractor sent a Serbian music promoter to Cuba with these covert marching orders: Recruit one of Havana’s most notorious rappers to spark a youth movement against the government. In communist Cuba, it was a project that could have landed Rajko Bozic in jail. So when he made his pitch to team up with hip-hop artist Aldo Rodriguez, Bozic left out the part about his true intentions- or that he was working for the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Dreadlocked, muscled and tattooed, Aldo, as he was known, was a hero in the hip-hop underground for lyrics protesting the Castro government’s grip on everyday life in songs like “El Rap Es Guerra,” or “Rap Is War,” words he tattooed on his forearm. He and his group, Los Aldeanos, were about to unknowingly get sucked into a tug-of-war between Havana and Washington, as thousands of pages of documents obtained by The Associated Press and dozens of interviews show.
With Aldo’s own government already harassing his group- his first album was titled “Censurado”- Bozic had been sent to turn up the volume of his protest songs. USAID’s secret Cuban hip-hop project sought to spread democracy, but like other U.S. operations on the island, it was executed by amateurs.
Documents show USAID repeatedly put innocent Cubans and its own operatives in jeopardy despite warning signs. Authorities detained or interrogated musicians or USAID operatives at least six times, often confiscating their computers and thumb drives, which in some cases contained material linking them to USAID.
Instead of sparking a democratic revolution, it compromised an authentic source of protest that had produced some of the hardest-hitting grassroots criticism since Fidel Castro took power in 1959, an AP investigation found. In a written statement, USAID said the programs were part of a four-year contract that ended in 2012, but denied they were clandestine.
“Any assertions that our work is secret or covert are simply false,” USAID said in a statement Wednesday. Its programs were aimed at strengthening civil society “often in places where civic engagement is suppressed and where people are harassed, arrested, subjected to physical harm or worse.”
Creative Associates declined to comment.
The hip-hop operation ran simultaneously with two other USAID programs exposed by the AP earlier this year- the launch of a secret “Cuban Twitter” and a program that sent Latin American youth to provoke dissent- and also involved elaborate subterfuge, including a front organization and an exotic financial scheme to mask American involvement.
USAID targeted some of Cuba’s most prominent musicians, including two icons close to the revolutionary government- Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes- and even members of the Castro family. It all hinged on a strategy of subtle continued…

UNGA to take up resolution to declare June 21 as World Yoga DayUNGA to declare June 21 as World Yoga Day
PTI
United Nations, December 11, 2014
First Published: 12:12 IST(11/12/2014)
print
The UN General Assembly will take up an India-led resolution on Thursday to declare June 21 every year as 'International Day of Yoga', with an unprecedented 175 countries joining as co-sponsors, less than three months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed the idea.
The draft resolution would recognise that "yoga provides a holistic approach to health and well-being," echoing Modi's remarks to the annual General Assembly session in September.
Besides proclaiming June 21 as the international Yoga day, the resolution would recognise that wider dissemination of information about the benefits of practising yoga would be beneficial for the health of the world population and invite all member and observer States, organizations of the UN system and other international and regional bodies to observe it in order to raise awareness of the benefits of practising yoga.
The resolution was prepared by India and informal consultations were convened in October by the Indian mission in the UN General Assembly where views on the topic were expressed by other delegations.
Garnering overwhelming support, 175 countries in the 193-member General Assembly have joined as co-sponsors as on December 9th, the highest number of co-sponsors ever for any UNGA resolution.
It is also for the first time that such an initiative has been proposed and implemented by any country in the UN General Assembly in less than 90 days.
In suggesting the June 21 date, Modi had indicated that the day has special significance in many parts of the world, being the longest day in the northern hemisphere.
The resolution would be adopted under 'Global Health and Foreign Policy.'
The initial official document circulated to the General Assembly, known as the L document, had 130 member states joining as co-sponsors, again the highest ever number of co-sponsors for such a document.
Significantly, overwhelming support for the Modi's initiative has been reflected in the various key nations that have come on board to co-sponsor the resolution including the five permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia, the UK and the United States.
Several Asian, European and Latin American countries and nearly 60% of African nations are also co-sponsorers including Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Egypt, Germany, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Myanmar, Nepal, South Korea, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Syria, Thailand and the UAE.
The president of the UN General Assembly Sam Kutesa and UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon are also expected to issue congratulatory statements once the resolution is introduced by India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asoke Kumar Mukerji and adopted.
Yoga is the 5,000-year-old Indian physical, mental and spiritual practice that aim to transform body and mind.

Nifty Remains Below 8 300 amid Selloff in Oil  Metal StocksYou are here: Home Market
Sensex Falls 250 Points, Nifty Below 8,300
NDTV | Updated On: December 11, 2014 11:26 (IST)
L&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
Indian stock markets tumbled after a flat start on Thursday with the BSE Sensex falling over 270 points or 0.9 per cent in morning trade. The broader Nifty slipped below the key 8,300 mark for the first time since November 7.
Thursday's selloff came on the back of weakness in global sentiments. Most stock markets in Asia traded with deep cuts after the Dow fell over 200 points overnight. Global markets have been falling because of a crash in energy stocks, which are being weighed down by lower crude prices.
The fall in crude prices is good for India, which imports nearly 80 per cent of its oil needs. However, domestic oil companies have come under pressure because of pressure on margins.
Gail India was down 2.2 per cent, off day's lows. ONGC, Cairn India and Reliance Industries were also among the top Nifty losers.
Other stocks to witness selling pressure today included index heavyweight Infosys, which tumbled for the 10th straight day, down 1.75 per cent.
Only twelve Nifty stocks traded higher. IT outsourcer Tech Mahindra was up 1.1 per cent, while Bhel was the top Nifty gainer with 2.1 per cent gains. UltraTech Cement, Bajaj Auto were among the other Nifty gainers.
Sugar stocks surged on Thursday after the government approved ethanol procurement. Bajaj Hindusthan and Shree Renuka Sugars jumped over 6 per cent, while Balrampur Chini traded 7 per cent higher.
The slowing down in buying by foreign funds also seems to have impacted the momentum in stock markets. The Sensex and Nifty have gained nearly 35 per cent year-to-date on the back of around $40 billion buying by FIIs.
On Wednesday, FIIs bought cash shares worth just Rs 5 crore. The rupee also weakened to 62.17 per dollar in morning trade, weighting on sentiments, analysts said.
Market analyst Sarvendra Srivastava told NDTV that 8,400 remains a hurdle for Nifty and 8,180-8,200 levels could be tested in the near term.
As of 11.15 a.m., the Sensex traded 199 points lower at 27,631, while the Nifty traded 57 points lower at 8,298.

Sweet picks! Sugar stocks surge 11%; here s whySugar companies rally as government fixes higher ethanol price
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Dec 11, 2014, 11.09AM IST

(Shares of sugar companies…)
MUMBAI: Shares of sugar companies surged in early trade after the government fixed a price of Rs 48.50-49.50 per litre for procurement of ethanol for blending with petrol.
The rate is much higher than the price oil companies presently pay to buy the sugarcane extract.
Oil firms presently pay about Rs 29/litre for ethanol. The Food Ministry had said that ex-sugar mill price of ethanol is around Rs 42.02 per litre. For ethanol suppliers, the landed cost of ethanol at the OMCs depots would be around Rs 49 per litre.
According to Narendra Murkumbi, MD, Shree Renuka Sugars, this will lead to additional demand for 1.25 million litres of ethanol.
In an interview to ET Now, he said the ethanol price has been de-linked from price of petrol for the first time and has been linked to cane pricing.
New pricing will make it easier for mills to convert sugar to ethanol and the industry will have flexibility to move between sugar & ethanol production.
He expects new tender to be launched immediately.
The Cabinet Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) today fixed the delivered price of Ethanol in the range of Rs 48.50 per litre to Rs 49.50 per litre, depending upon the distance of sugar mill from the depot/installation of the public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs), an official statement said.
At 10:00 a.m.; Bajaj Hindusthan was at Rs 22.40, up 6.67 per cent, on the BSE. It surged 11.42 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 23.40.
Balrampur Chini was at Rs 62.50, up 6.56 per cent, on the BSE. It surged 8.61 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 63.70.
Dhampur Sugar was at Rs 47.75, up 4.60 per cent, on the BSE. It surged 7.22 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 48.95.
Dwarikesh Sugars was at Rs 34.95, up 6.23 per cent, on the BSE. It surged 12.45 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 48.95.
Shree Renuka Sugars was at Rs 17.80, up 5.64 per cent, on the BSE. It surged 10.97 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 18.70.

Railways opens up more than Rs 90 000 crore FDI opportunityRailways opens up more than Rs 90,000 cr of FDI opportunity
Sudheer Pal Singh | New Delhi Dec 12, 2014 12:44 AM IST
Foreign investors can put in as much as Rs 90,300 crore in India’s rail infrastructure through the foreign direct investment (FDI) route, suggests a list of projects released by the railway ministry.
The Rs 63,000-crore Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed corridor project is the single largest. The other big ones include the Rs 14,000-crore CSTM-Panvel suburban corridor, to be implemented in public-private partnership (PPP), and the Rs 1,200-crore Kachrapara rail coach factory, besides multiple freight line, electrification and signalling projects.
“We are going to hold two investor meets to apprise potential investors of the kind of models and projects on offer for participation,” Railway Board Chairman Arunendra Kumar said. The ministry had earlier this month held an investor meet that saw participation of about 150 top executives from 65 private companies.
Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu had said the ministry would put in place an “investor-friendly framework to transform the national transporter into an efficient organisation, attract investment on a long-term sustainable basis and in three years make the railways better than what it is today”.
The Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed corridor stretches 534 km and will be implemented on a design-build-finance-operate-transfer (DBFOT) basis, with government-to-government cooperation. For the Kachrapara rail coach factory, the ministry has finalised the lowest price per coach as the bidding parameter. The factor is being planned to roll out 500 such coaches annually.
According to the Railway Board, the discussions at the previous investor meet surrounded the overview of five models of participative policy, framework of engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts and sectoral guidelines for foreign and domestic investment. The ministry’s brass has also deliberated on a new model concession agreement under the PPP model and new projects like station development to be rolled out under PPP with investors.
Among the companies that have so far expressed interest in the ministry’s PPP initiative are Reliance Infrastructure, Larsen & Toubro, Siemens, Adani Ports, GMR, Tata Infrastructure, Gammon, Jindal Steel and Power, JSW, Bombardier, GE, Alstom, Electromotive Diesel, Bharat Heavy Electricals, NMDC, HSBC and JPMorgan.

Delhi shame: Woman executive raped by Uber cab driverThe cabbie even gave her a missed call from his mobile phone, police added.
Madhur Verma, DCP (north), said a medical exam had confirmed rape and an FIR had been lodged.
According to the complaint, the woman had gone to a restaurant for dinner with some friends after her shift ended at 7pm. One of her friends dropped her till Vasant Vihar from where she hired the cab.
On the way, the woman dozed off on the back seat only to wake up and find that the car had stopped at a secluded spot.
The car doors were locked. When she tried to raise an alarm, the driver thrashed and assaulted her, police said.
Police sources said the woman had identified the driver as one Gaurav and even clicked his photo on her mobile phone.
"The woman clicked a photograph of the car's number plate and then made a PCR call to report the incident," police said.
The cab was later found abandoned in Mathura and the driver’s mobile phone, which has a GPS system, was switched off, the DCP said.
The woman is believed to have booked the cab through Uber, which, according to its website, connects "riders to drivers through our apps".
"A case has been registered at Sarai Rohilla police station under Sections 376 (rape), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC.
 
"Raids are being conducted to nab the driver, who is in his mid-30s," a police official said.
The cab company released a statement late Saturday night, confirming that the driver in question had been suspended. 
“We became aware of the incident this morning. Safety is Uber’s highest priority and we are working with the police as they investigate, and will assist them in any way we can,” the release said.
The incident comes at a time when the Capital is under a high-security alert following threats of a sensational terror attack by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. Vehicle checks have been stepped up across the city and anti-sabotage barricades put in place ahead of US President Barack Obama’s Republic Day visit to India.

Delhi rape: Uber cabbie held  to be produced before court todayComments
The Uber cab driver accused of raping a 25-year-old financial analyst in Delhi was arrested from his home town Mathura on Sunday, as the US online taxi-booking service faced several questions over lack of security checks.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, was nabbed by a joint team of the Delhi and Mathura police from the temple town in Uttar Pradesh where his car was found abandoned a day earlier.
He would be produced before a court in the Capital on Monday, Madhur Verma, deputy commissioner of Delhi Police (north), said.
Yadav allegedly assaulted a 25-year-old woman MNC employee in north Delhi's Sarai Rohilla late Friday night. The woman hailed a ride with him via Uber, which has launched an aggressive international expansion.
The alleged rape, reported days before the second anniversary of the brutal gangrape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in a moving bus in the Capital in December 2012, could have Uber facing legal action.
The San Francisco-based firm failed to run a background check on Yadav, also the car owner, and the vehicle was without a satellite tracking device, the police said. The address he gave to Uber was fake.
Police served a notice on the firm, asking it to join the investigation. “Every violation by Uber will be evaluated and we’ll go for legal recourse,” Verma said. The police would take legal advice before opting to press a criminal or civil case, he added.
The cab service initially could not produce the call records of the accused as the server was located in the US.
This made it difficult for the police initially. The breakthrough came after around 12 police teams carried out raids in different parts of UP, especially around Mathura, 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of New Delhi where the crime took place.
Laxmi Singh, deputy inspector general for Agra Range, said, "Police in Mathura, in coordination with the Delhi Police, were looking for the accused, who was finally arrested on Sunday evening from Meera Mohan Colony under Highway police station."
The driver had locked himself in a house to dodge the police teams chasing him, Deepak Mishra, special commissioner of Delhi Police (law and order), said.
The arrest came barely 30 minutes after the Delhi Police announced a reward of Rs. 1 lakh for information leading to Yadav.
Uber faces the heat
Uber has faced critical news coverage over its driver screening in the US.
“Safety is Uber’s highest priority and in India, we work with licenced driver-partners to provide a safe transportation option, with layers of safeguards such as driver and vehicle information, and ETA-sharing to ensure there is accountability and traceability of all trips that occur on the Uber platform,” said Evelyn Tay, an Uber spokesperson.
But, it took the Delhi Police almost eight hours to trace Uber’s office in Gurgaon though the victim had provided them a picture of the car’s number plate she clicked on her phone.
Investigators found the Uber office locked, police said. The supervisor, they said, had little information about Yadav.
“The iPhone that was provided to him by Uber to track his location was switched off,” a senior investigating officer said. The SIM card of the phone was registered in the name of another driver, Gaurav, who told them that Yadav was a native of Mathura, the officer said.
Crime capital
The rape victim, who works for a finance company in Gurgaon, told police she boarded the Uber cab at 9.30pm from south Delhi's Vasant Vihar, where she had gone for a party with friends.
She was raped at an isolated place between Sarai Rohilla and Inderlok, police said, adding the cabbie threatened to kill and sexually assault her with a rod if she resisted him. He dropped her home after the attack.
The cabbie even gave her a missed call from his mobile phone, police added.
According to her complaint, the woman had gone to a restaurant for dinner with some friends after her shift ended at 7pm. One of her friends dropped her till Vasant Vihar from where she hired the cab.
On the way, the woman dozed off on the back seat only to wake up and find that the car had stopped at a secluded spot.
The car doors were locked. When she tried to raise an alarm, the driver thrashed and sexually assaulted her, police said.
"The woman clicked a photograph of the car's number plate and then made a PCR call to report the incident," police added.
The incident comes at a time when the Capital is under a high-security alert following threats of a sensational terror attack by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Vehicle checks have been stepped up across the city and anti-sabotage barricades put in place ahead of US President Barack Obama's Republic Day visit to India.
Protests erupt
Dozens of students scuffled with officers on Sunday as they tried to enter police headquarters in New Delhi to protest the rising incidents of rape in the Capital.
"I am here to protest the irregularities and failure of the state machinery, which refuses to acknowledge that rapes happen due to their failure," said Urvashi Joshi, one of the demonstrators.
The protesters, from the All India Students Association, dispersed after an hour-long demonstration.
Commenting on the issue, Kunal Lalani, president of Association of Radio Taxis in India, condemned the incident and said the guilty should be booked immediately.
 
"The cab company concerned must come forward and extend whole-hearted cooperation to the authorities probing the incident. This one-off incident has prompted all the taxi/cab companies to further tighten their background checks of its own employees/drivers prior to employing them to ensure that such heinous activity does not occur in future.
 
"This incident also calls for a stronger government regulation of taxi players which do not essentially operate under the licenced format of taxis and merely function as aggregators. We will take this up with the government," Lalani said.

FCI paid Rs 7 500 crore to states as taxes in2013-14Commodities see longest losing streak in 23 years
The Food Corporation of India (FCI) has paid more than R7,500 crore in the last fiscal to states as taxes or levies on the grain procurement.
According to a statement submitted in Lok Sabha by food minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Tuesday, the corporation paid more than R3,567 crore and R1,796 crore as taxes to Punjab and Haryana respectively in 2013-14. These two states contribute the highest amount of foodgrain mostly consisting of rice and wheat to the Centre’s procurement drive.
The government agency also paid taxes or levies worth of R1,038 crore to Andhra Pradesh and R334 croe to Chhattisgarh government in last fiscal.

As per the food ministry data, FCI had paid R6,109 crore as taxes or levies to states in 2011-12.
In the five largest grain-producing states with a surplus — Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha — these levies account for 10-15% of the minimum support price (MSP) given to farmers.
The highest taxes imposed on grain procurement are in the states such as Punjab (14.5%), Andhra Pradesh (12.5%), Haryana (11.5%), Odisha (12%) and Chhattisgarh (9.7%).
Terming that high rate of taxes or levies on grain procurement leads to rise in procurement costs of FCI, Paswan said “time to time we have requested state governments for reduction of taxes being imposed by them and since theses taxes or levies are statutory in nature, it is not possible for the government to take any unilateral decision on the matter.”
The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) in its price policy for rabi crops for the marketing season 2014-15 had stated that “the Centre needs to review its open ended procurement policy and take a policy decision to limit procurement from states that imposes taxes and levies beyond 5% of MSP”.
“This is necessary step to bring about rationality in pricing, contain the food subsidy bill and getting the markets right,” CACP had observed in its report.
However, Ashok Gulati, former chairman of CACP told FE that “the higher taxation and levies drive out the private players from grain purchase and distort the market, impacting processing and value-added industry”.
A food ministry official said that the state government needs to reduce high state-level taxes in a phased manner as these levies are also adding to the country’s food security bill. “But we also acknowledge that these taxes on procurement are the key sources of revenue specially for Haryana, Punjab and other states,” the official noted.

Gold fourth major item on household list:StudyCommodities see longest losing streak in 23 years
Indian households spend more money on gold than on apparel, consumer durables and entertainment, as the precious metal makes up for 8.13% of their total expenditure, just trailing expenses on food & groceries, education and medical facilities, according to a latest survey by Ficci on behalf of the World Gold Council.
The survey, a part of a report titled “Why India Needs A Gold Policy”, has thrown up some interesting findings: As many as 77% of respondents bought gold last year despite the crackdown by the government and the RBI and more than a half of them bought more gold in 2013 than in the previous year; roughly 77% said they bought the precious metal due to its safe-haven status and 53% consider it primarily an adornment, while half of the respondents believe gold serves both the purposes.

In a boost to the debate on firming up policies to monetise household stocks, the survey revealed a half of the respondents say they are willing to deposit gold if they get an interest on it and a further 12% say they may consider doing so. Importantly, 72% of them say they have no problems in their gold jewellery or coins getting melted after they deposit it in a bank.
“This study serves to demystify several myths, including the notions that Indians are averse to the idea of melting their jewellery and they may not deposit gold in a bank even if a proper and transparent system is carved out,” Somasundaram PR, managing director (India) of WGC, told FE. “The idea is to generate a wide-ranging debate involving various stake holders on the need for the country to look beyond the restrictive measures to tackle gold imports in the long run,” he added.
As the economy grows and more and more people come out of poverty, demand for gold will automatically rise, Somasundaram said. “We need to have a concrete road map as to how we can deal with such a situation. This is because we can’t curtail demand by targeting supplies, as supplies will then find other avenues of creeping into the system. One of the solutions to reduce imports could be to source idle gold stocks from domestic households and put it into productive use,” he said.
Ficci secretary general A Didar Singh said, “The consumption of gold has always been greatly intertwined with the household’s financial planning goals and has, through generations, remained an obvious and natural choice of saving.”
Nirupama Soundararajan, lead author of the study, said the country needs to establish an India Gold Exchange.

OPEC cuts oil demand forecast for 2015 amid US shale boomOPEC cuts oil demand forecast for 2015 amid US shale boom
Alex Lawler     London   Last Updated: December 10, 2014  | 17:57 IST

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut its 2015 forecast for oil demand amid the United States shale boom.
Global demand for oil from OPEC in 2015 will be less-than-expected because of weaker growth in consumption and the US shale boom, the cartel said on Wednesday, pointing to an increasing supply surplus in 2015.
In a monthly report, OPEC forecast that the demand for the group's oil will drop to 28.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2015, 2,80,000 bpd lower from its previous expectation.
The report follows OPEC's decision in November against cutting oil output despite plunging prices of the fuel, as top exporter Saudi Arabia urged fellow members to combat the US shale oil boom that has been eroding OPEC's market share.

Satyarthi  Malala receive Nobel Peace Prize 2014Kailash Satyarthi, Malala Yousafzai receive Nobel Peace Prize 2014

Child rights activist Kailash Satyarthi received the Nobel Peace Prize for 2014 on Wednesday, sharing it with Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever Nobel laureate, for their work on promoting child rights in the troubled sub-continent, where millions are deprived of their childhood and education.
"Satyarthi and Yousafzai are precisely the people whom Alfred Nobel in his will calls champions of peace", Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee Thorbjorn Jagland said in his speech before awarding them the prize.
"A young girl and a somewhat older man, one from Pakistan and one from India, one Muslim, the other Hindu; both symbols of what the world needs: more unity. Fraternity between the nations"!, he added.
Satyarthi, 60, who gave up his job as an electrical engineer to run an NGO for rescuing children from forced labour and trafficking, and 17-year-old Malala, who survived a near-fatal Taliban attack two years ago with determination advocating education for girls, were named by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee for the prestigious award on October 10.
They received the Nobel medal which is 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold and weighs around 175 grams. They will share $1.1 million prize money.
Noting that violence and repression cannot be justified in any religion, Jagland said Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism protect life and cannot be used to take lives.
"The two whom we honour here today stand very firm on this point. They live according to a principle Mahatma Gandhi gave expression to. He said: 'There are many purposes I would have died for. There are no purposes I would have killed for", Jagland said, invoking Mahatma Gandhi.
Satyarthi's NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save Childhood Movement) prides itself on liberating over 80,000 children from bonded labour in factories and workshops across India.
According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) there are about 168 million child labourers globally.
There are roughly 60 million child labourers in India alone.
Malala, who was nominated in the peace prize category last year also, had displayed tremendous courage even after the Taliban attack when she resolutely expressed her determination to carry on with her campaign for child rights and girls education especially in a country like Pakistan.
Speaking after receiving the award, Satyarthi asked audience to feel the child inside them and said the crime against children has no place in a civilised society.
"Children are questioning our inaction and watching our action, he said, adding that all religion teach to take care of children.
Noting that the number of child labour has been reduced by a third, Satyarthi said, "My dream is to make every child free to develop. There is no greater violence than to deny the dreams of children".
Recounting his experience with the unprivileged people, he said, "I am representing the sound of silence of millions of children who are left behind".
"The credit to this honour goes to people who worked and sacrificed for freeing children", he said.
Famed Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Indian musician Amjad Ali Khan performed at the award ceremony. Pakistan's former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani was among those present on the occasion.

Palestinian official dies after scuffle with Israeli troopsPalestinian Cabinet member Ziad Abu Ain, left, takes part in a protest against Israeli settlements in the village of Turmus Aya near the West Bank city of Ramallah, Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2014. Abu Ain died shortly after the protest. (Source:AP)
By: Associated Press | Turmus Aya (west Bank) |
Posted: December 10, 2014 8:50 pm
A Palestinian Cabinet member died shortly after he and other protesters scuffled with Israeli troops on December 10 near a West Bank village. The forces also fired tear gas close to the demonstrators, witnesses said.
During the scuffle, a member of Israel’s security forces held Ziad Abu Ain, 55, by the neck. Abu Ain later collapsed, received first aid and died en route to a hospital, witnesses said.
What killed the Palestinian official remains unclear and his body will undergo an autopsy attended by Palestinian, Jordanian and Israeli pathologists, the Israeli army said. But death of Abu Ain, the first Palestinian Cabinet member to die immediately after a protest, likely will enflame simmering tensions that remain after U.S.-brokered peace talks collapsed earlier this year.
Later Wednesday, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy was shot in the head and seriously wounded in a confrontation with Israeli soldiers in the nearby Jalazoun refugee camp, said Ahmed Bitawi, the head of Ramallah Hospital. The Israeli military said it was checking the report.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to meet with senior officials from the Palestine Liberation Organization and his Fatah movement later Wednesday to discuss a possible response to Abu Ain’s death. In a statement, Abbas called the death a “barbaric act,” but added that he would wait for the results of the investigation before deciding on a response. He also called for three days of mourning in the Palestinian territories.
Some called for suspending Palestinian security coordination with Israel in the West Bank, but it was not clear if that option would be considered.
Wednesday’s events began with a march by several dozen Palestinians who headed to agricultural land near the West Bank village of Turmus Aya to plant olive tree saplings, participants said. The land is close to an Israeli settlement and mostly off limits to the village’s farmers, protesters said.
As the marchers walked toward the land, Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and threw stun grenades at the Palestinians, said Kamal Abu Sassaka, an assistant to Abu Ain who said he was by the Cabinet member’s side the entire time.
Abu Ain told an Israeli officer that this was a peaceful protest, but was told the group could not move further, said Abu Sassaka.
He said there was pushing and shoving between marchers and soldiers, and that soldiers fired tear gas toward the legs of the Palestinians.
He said one soldier hit Abu Ain in the chest with his rifle butt. An AP photographer and an Israeli reporter at the scene said continued…

GOSF  Day 1: E-tailers discount shoppers  penchant for rebatesRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
In the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, when the clock struck 12, netizens woke up to one of the biggest online shopping jamborees in the country. With over 5 million potential shoppers already visiting the site gosf.in to register themselves, the 72-hour Great Online Shopping Festival (GOSF) from Google has 450 vendors this time, up from 250 last year and just 90 in 2012, when the festival was just for 24 hours.
Last year, about 2 million users visited the site and the merchants posted twice the growth on their daily average sales. This year, most partners are expecting three times the sales.
However, unlike the enthusiastic netizens, most websites woke up to this year’s GOSF late. While Jabong’s mobile app was updated and ready with GOSF discounts early on Wednesday morning, Amazon and Snapdeal reportedly woke up to the event a little later in the morning. However, Amazon and Snapdeal reportedly did not have GOSF on their main menu even after Myntra, now owned by Flipkart, interestingly had a very tepid discount of only 30% (for orders above Rs 1,599 – next to nothing in e-commerce terms) under the GOSF deals. In contrast, Myntra had a 50% off sale on Sunday.
This year, Google has a special section offering products at Rs 299 with free shipping and cash on delivery to attract first-time buyers, who comprised over 30% customers last year. Discounts may not be on the lower side this year, but are visible across fewer and select categories and brands.
Compared to last year, discounts have indeed come down for gadgets, a category that has picked up tremendously in online retail, said Nitin Mathur, co-founder, 91mobiles, an online gadget research and comparison site. “However, online retailers may be utilising discounting as a tool more to promote other emerging categories such as fashion and accessories (which are relatively newer categories for some of the online stores), and new distribution channels such as their mobile apps…” he added.
Discounts are just a medium to attract first-time shoppers, said Manu Agarwal, founder, Naaptol: “…The idea of Google is to educate people who haven’t experienced e-commerce as a shopping medium.”
On the first day of GOSF, on Tuesday, Jabong observed an extraordinary leap with its revenue rising four times compared to its sales on any regular day. “There has been a rise in revenue from mobile by at least six times compared to the last GOSF. Even the traffic from GOSF on the website has significantly risen by eight times as compared to last year,” said Praveen Sinha, founder and MD, Jabong.
This year, Jabong has opened its doors to some of the best offers from exclusive brands like River Island, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, among others, Sinha added.
Meanwhile, ShopClues saw unprecedented sales and an increase in traffic by as much as 200%, just within the first 90 minutes of the festival launch. Sanjay Sethi, co-founder and CEO, ShopClues, said, “When the GOSF offers went live at 12 midnight, our site saw a 200% surge in traffic and close to 250% increase in sales within the first 90 minutes.
ShopClues had discounts going up to 85% on some of its top-selling products.
eBay India has special promotions and offers every day with customers having the opportunity to win an iPhone every 15 minutes and a Google Glass each day. Shivani Dhanda, head – marketing, eBay India, said: “This GOSF, eBay India customers will be able to access great deals and discounts across a wide range of products. We are offering special deals across brands and categories along with discounts on watches, cameras, TVs, laptops and home décor, among others. We are also offering consumers exclusive eBay merchandise including the iberry Auxus ONE smartphone and iberry RIST smartwatch.”
HomeShop18 is offering discounts of up to 80% with deliveries at no extra shipping cost, with its lowest product going for as little as R149. “In previous years of GOSF, we witnessed exceptional increase in traffic and sales on both the website as well as our mobile platform. This shopping festival has proved beneficial for us, recording a 3x increase in sales and 40% more traffic via the app… The categories that drive sales during the shopping festival are clothing, accessories and footwear, digital products, electronics and gadgets,” said Sundeep Malhotra, founder and CEO, HomeShop18.
For the second year in a row, Adlabs Entertainment is expecting online ticket sales to go up by 50-75% for Imagica and Aquamagica, its theme and water park, respectively, located at Khalapur off Mumbai-Pune Expressway.
At Adlabs, 20-30% of ticket sales continue to be from its website where customers pick and choose their choice of packages and offers.
As part of GOSF, Amazon India is doling out offers from across categories with a 10% cashback on HDFC Bank debit and credit cards (for purchases above R3,999). The e-commerce major is offering up to 70% off on home and kitchen products, books, movies, music and video games, up to 60% off in fashion and a flat 40% off on select products in toys and games.

Nikkei Losses 1.6%; Falling Oil Hits Risk Sentiment, Dollar Pressured
Reuters | Updated On: December 11, 2014 07:28 (IST)
L&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
Tokyo: Asian stocks fell early on Thursday as falling oil prices continued to feed into global growth concerns, while the dollar lost more ground against peers such as the yen and euro after a further drop in US bond yields.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 per cent as another large drop in oil prices took a heavy toll on energy shares and hit Wall Street hard overnight.
Crude oil prices fell as much as 5 per cent overnight after data underscored weak US demand and Saudi Arabia reiterated that it has no plans to curb output.
US crude posted a modest rebound early on Thursday after the overnight tumble, gaining 26 cents to $61.20 a barrel after falling to a 5-1/2 year low of $60.43 on Wednesday.
Tokyo's Nikkei lost 1.6 per cent, pulling further back from 7-1/2 year highs hit at the week's start, with sentiment bruised by the rout in US stocks, while the yen's rebound against the dollar showed little sign of ending.
The dollar was down 0.1 per cent at 117.610 yen, continuing its retreat from a seven-year high of 121.86 reached on Monday.
The S&P 500, at a record high just last Friday, fell to its lowest since early November on Wednesday.
"Recent nervousness in equity market sentiment is consistent with our view that equity fund positioning is near peak levels, which points to a near-term pullback," strategists at Barclays said in a note to clients.
"With underperformance by active managers, we worry that redemptions will continue and force an unwind of currently extended positioning," they said.
In addition to declining oil, concerns over the political situation in Greece have also dented appetite for risk assets.
The euro gained 0.3 per cent to $1.2479, putting further distance between a 2-1/2 year trough of $1.2247 hit on Monday.
Safe-haven government debt remained better-bid, with the 10-year US Treasury yield dropping by a basis point to 2.1603.
The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield fell 1.5 basis points to 0.390 per cent, lowest since April 2013.

Smartphone addiction: 98% Indians sleep with their devices  says global surveyTata Motors sales up 10 pct in December
It seems we Indians are getting too addicted to our smartphones. As per a global survey by B2X Care Solutions, a provider of customer care for smartphones, 57% of Indians said they can’t live without their smartphones. As if this was not enough, it was discovered that 98% Indians sleep with their smartphones and 83% keep it on their body or within reach throughout the day.
The survey on mobile device usage, consumer behavior and service expectations polled more than 2,500 smartphone and tablet users from the United States, Germany, Brazil, India and China, the top five smartphone regions globally.
Incidentally, Americans, Chinese and Indians would be less likely than Germans to hand over their smartphone, even if they were given $100 a day or $500 a week to go without it; they’d be much more willing in the case of tablets. In all countries respondents said they would give up their TV before their phone. In the US they were willing to forgo a best best friend while Brazilians suggest they don’t mind saying bye to their spouse or partner to retain their phone. Thankfully, in India and China the tradeoff ended with the car.
A third of the Indians surveyed and more than half the Chinese had used a repair or exchange service for a device, more often than not covered under the manufacturer’s warranty. Repairs in India, China and the USA were covered by an extended warranty than it was the case for other countries.
The top 3 smartphone pain points were listed as software problems, damage to the display and faulty batteries, while for tablets this was battery, software and screen freezes. While new companies in India vouch by the existence of a hotline for customer support, it was identified as the least used channel as  most go to the store where they purchased the device.
While 15% of devices are not fixed correctly the first time, India has the least efficiency with this number dropping to 22%. China is most efficient with just 8% incorrect repairs.
While a high 24% Indian respondents said they need customer support at least once a month, 39% of them had no idea where to get help if they need support.
Brazilians are the global leaders when it comes to smartphone usage and 63% spend more than 3 hours per day on the phone. India is number two with 42%, well ahead of USA at 26%.

Shares of  GAIL slipped 3 percent intraday on Thursday after CLSA reiterated sell rating on the stock with a cautious outlook that there is more downside likely. The brokerage has also slashed its target price to Rs 425 per share and lowered earnings per share (EPS) due to cut in Brent crude price.
“We estimate that current stock price is building in Brent of USD 100 per barrel. The stock is trading 50 percent above its historical average price to equity (PE). We find these valuations unsustainable,” it says in a report.
As per CLSA, new EPS estimates are 14-27 percent below consensus signalling clear risk of downgrades for GAIL.
Benchmark oil prices fell to new five-year lows after Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut its demand outlook for global oil consumption and US data showed a surprise jump in oil inventories. Slowdown in Chinese economy and Europe is also dragging global oil demand.
CLSA has also reduced its Brent crude price forecasts to USD 70-80 per barrel for calendar year 2015-16.
At 10:36 hrs GAIL India was quoting at Rs 445.30, down Rs 9.85, or 2.16 percent on the BSE.

Moneycontrol Bureau
Shares in Naresh Goyal Jet Airways  have soared about 77 percent in 13 trading sessions, from a low of Rs 253 to Rs 447 currently, amid expectations it would be a likely beneficiary if troubled rival SpiceJet  were to collapse.
Low-cost Spice, controlled by Kalanithi Maran, has increasingly teetered on the edge, notching up losses of about Rs 1,000 crore last fiscal, and following it up with another Rs 310 crore loss in the second quarter of this fiscal.
Among several indications that the airline is grappling for survival are reports of dues being unpaid to employees, oil companies and airport operators among others, the slew of massive discounts it has resorted to this year (in an indication the firm may not even have working capital funds and was resorting to such a tactic to keep operations going) and scaling down massively on operations.
Following Kingfisher’s grounding in 2012, if SpiceJet were to go belly up, the field would narrow down to only four major players -- IndiGo, Jet, Air India and GoAir – theoretically giving them greater pricing power at least till such time new entrants Air Asia and Vistara rollout operations in a big way.
On the other hand, Jet, which too reported a massive Rs 4,000 crore loss last fiscal, has reported steady improvement in business.
After Abu Dhabi-based Etihad infused Rs 2,600 crore in the firm in lieu of a 26 percent stake last year, the carrier rolled out a three-year blueprint to return to profitability -- in which it outlined several steps such as shutting down lossmaking low-cost operations, something it has already proceeded to do.
In the September quarter, Jet’s quarterly loss narrowed 96 percent year-on-year, from Rs 999 crore to Rs 43 crore.
While, in another piece of good news for the firm , oil prices tanked 35 percent from their peak this year, resulting in jet fuel prices being slashed five times. Fuel costs account for one-third to half of an airliner’s typical operational costs.
There are other increment positive developments for the sector as well, reports say the government may give into the long-standing demand to provide “infrastructure” status to the aviation industry, something that should significantly ease borrowing pressures on such firms.
Legendary trader and investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who picked up SpiceJet shares recently, in what has till now turned out to be a mistake, too said at a CNBC-TV18 summit that he originally wanted to buy Jet shares but passed on it on a whim – while maintaining Spice was but merely a trading punt for him.
But on a more fundamental basis, investors may find better plays elsewhere, according to Mayuresh Joshi of Angel Broking.
In a recent interview with CNBC-TV18 , Joshi said that while falling oil prices were a positive for Jet, its high interest cost (Rs 212 crore as of September quarter on debt of Rs 9,800 crore), which may weigh on profitability. As well, load factors (percentage of seats occupied, on average) will need to rise significantly from the 70s they have hovered at recently, he added.
“All that plus valuations around 0.6 times enterprise value-to-sales, I think Jet is trading at fair value at the current levels,” Joshi said in the interview last month when shares were still trading close to Rs 300 levels. “My belief is that the cash flows to get reflected on the financial statements will take some amount of time to come and probably long-term investors have got much better plays.”

Cabinet approves changes to Electricity Act  2003Dec 11, 2014 at 11:58am IST
Cabinet approves changes to Electricity Act, 2003

New Delhi: The union cabinet on Wednesday approved the various amendments to the Electricity Act, 2003 as per the power ministry's proposed amendment bill.
"The amendments will usher in much-needed further reforms in the power sector, promote competition, efficiency in operations and improvement in quality of supply of electricity in the country resulting in capacity addition and ultimate benefit to the consumers," an official release said.
Power Minister Piyush Goyal had said last week at an event here that the amendments would be tabled in the ongoing winter session of Parliament.
The share of renewable energy is currently around 6 per cent of a total base made up of 1 trillion units of electricity.
#electricity act #cabinet #amendment bill #piyush goyal
The proposed changes envisage strengthening the penalty provisions, increasing the penalty manifold and making them more enforceable.
Changes to the tariff policy are also being proposed, the minister had said. To encourage more competition in power distribution, it is proposed to give consumers a choice of companies for power supply, a ministry source told IANS.
Goyal said that reforms are also being planned in the distribution sector whereby the entire discom set-up will be unbundled.
"While there will be a government distributor of power to ensure that power is provided to the weaker sections of society, competition will be introduced and a private sector role in the sector," Goyal said.
To boost the wind energy sector, the government proposes to bring in amendments to the act introducing stricter penalties for failing to meet renewable purchase obligation (RPO) targets, Goyal, who is also minister of new and renewable energy, had said here last week which launching the newly formed wind power producers and manufacturers' organisation the Indian Wind Energy Alliance (IWEA).
Under the RPO system, the state power distribution companies have to mandatorily purchase electricity generated through renewable energy sources during the year.
The proposed changes will also introduce the renewable generation obligation (RGO), which will make it compulsory for thermal power producers to generate electricity through renewables, Goyal said.
Overall, the government was aiming at 2 trillion units of electricity generation by 2020, in which renewable sources are to account for 15 percent, Goyal said. The share of renewable energy is currently around 6 per cent of a total base made up of 1 trillion units of electricity.

Who will gain from Xiaomi s lossWho will gain from Xiaomi's loss?
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 12, 2014 12:43 AM IST
Xiaomi, the third-largest smartphone maker in the world, has sold 800,000-900,000 smartphones in India in the past year. While it is still not among the top five in India, its cheap pricing strategy has helped it penetrate the Indian market faster than any of its rivals.
Putting a shadow over its future in India, the Delhi High Court has restrained Xiaomi from selling handsets that run on technology patented by Ericsson in the country. If the order, which came earlier this week, stays effective, then Xiaomi would lose the fastest-growing smartphone market in the world.
The ban on Xiaomi would essentially emerge as an opportunity for Samsung and Motorola, which could improve their market share. Besides, home-grown Micromax, Karbonn and Xolo will also benefit.
BATTERY LOW
If the Delhi HC order stays effective, Xiaomi would lose the fastest growing smartphone market
 
Its flagship device Mi4 was to hit the Indian market late this year, after being a huge success abroad
About 72 million handsets - smartphones plus feature phones - were sold in India in the July-September 2014 quarter, according to IDC. Notably, as much as 70 per cent of the sales comprised feature phones. On Tuesday, during its regular flash sale on Flipkart, 75,000 of the newly-launched Redmi Note phones were sold. Prior to this, the company had sold an estimated 800,000 devices of Redmi 1S and Mi3 through its exclusive partnership with Flipkart. The company's flagship device Mi4, which has been a huge success abroad, is slated to hit the Indian market late this year.
This is not the first time a handset maker has got into a patent tussle with Ericsson. Micromax, India’s second-largest smartphone maker, has gone through a similar dispute. In November, the Delhi HC had asked Micromax to pay one per cent royalty to Ericsson for its patented technologies in its mobile handsets.
While Xiaomi has always received a warm hug from consumers, it has faced challenges as well. In October, Indian Air Force asked its personnel and their families not to buy Xiaomi smartphone because of security concerns. Following this, the company said it would set up a data centre in India to store local user data. Xiaomi also plans to make phones in India in the next couple of years. However, if the ban stays, the company might have to shut shop here.
 

"India will be the largest market for Carl s Jr outside the US in the long term""India will be the largest market for Carl's Jr outside the US in the long term"
Sounak Mitra | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 11:43 AM IST
After studying the market for about three years, California-based premium burger chain, Carl’s Jr -- a brand that has been endorsed by the likes of Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian and Padma Lakshmi, is set to open its first shop in India next April. The maker of charbroiled thickburgers has also developed customised menu that would melt well in India pallets. In the long term, India would become the largest market, in terms of total outlets, outside its home market the US, says Ned Lyerly, president (international), CKE Restaurants Holdings, which runs Carl’s Jr, in an interview with Sounak Mitra. Edited excerpts:
All burger chains are entering India, making it crowded. How would you differentiate yourself from the rest?
We have been studying the market, and have invested about $1.5 million in India in consumer research, product development and tasting trials during the past three years. We take time to start operations in any country. We are already present in 33 countries now, and this would go up to 40 by 2015 end. 
Every market is different, so is India. Our burgers are unique, and not like any others. It would be a bit premium, but our unique cooking and delivery makes us desirable. We have spent about two years in customising the menu. We’ll stay premium, low pricing is not on our agenda.
How different would be your offering in India?
Fir time in our history, we are introducing vegiterian burger. This, we may also take to other markets, like the West Asian countries, and even to the US. We have never spent so much time in developing veg menu. Quality, hospitality and innovation would be the key factors. But, we never change some of our core practises. That’s same everywhere, like the charbroiled burgers. 
How many outlets do you plan to open in India?
Cybiz BrightStar Restaurants, our partner for the North and West in India, will be opening at least 100 outlets in the first five years. Over the next five to seven years, India would have second most number of outlets, after Mexico, outside the US. Mexico will double in the next five years to about 400 stores, but the market has a threshold. But, the opportunity is huge in India. In the long term, India would be our largest market, in terms of total outlets, outside the US where we have 2,900 stores.
How fast are you growing in the international markets? 
We have doubled our international presence in the past four years, and we would double in the next four years. Besides India, new markets include, Australia, Columbia, Bangladesh, among others. 
Revenue wise, how much do international operations contribute?
At the moment, about 10 per cent of our revenue comes from international market. Over the next five years, we hope this to grow up to about 35 per cent. And eventually, revenue from international markets together would equalize with revenue from home market, in the long run.
Which are the markets giving you higher ticket size?
Markets like New Zealand, Singapore and Columbia.
Would you appoint a separate franchisee for the rest of India?
There is no plan as of now. We’ll see how the association goes with our current partner, and then decide on expansion. 
You have created hype in each of the markets you entered, with your promotions, endorsements, etc. What is the plan for India?
We are evaluating certain things. But, yet to take a call. Celebrity endorsements, and other promotions would be decided closer to the launch date.

I did not waver from my loyalty to Indira Gandhi : Pranab Mukherjee in  The Dramatic Decade'I did not waver from my loyalty to Indira Gandhi': Pranab Mukherjee in 'The Dramatic Decade'
Nivedita Mookerji | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 12:26 PM IST
President Pranab Mukherjee’s book The Dramatic Decade: The Indira Gandhi Years takes the readers through the economic and social unrest of the period leading up to the Emergency, the rise and fall of leaders, and splits within the Congress party, while promising to offer more in the next two volumes of the trilogy. 
The first volume, which was launched exclusively on Amazon on Thursday, documents Mukherjee’s relationship with Indira Gandhi through her good and bad years, as he tried to capture the essence of those years. According to the author, East Pakistan’s struggle for independence in 1971, the oil crisis of 1973, the Emergency in 1975 and the advent of coalition politics in 1977 were among the developments that signaled a ‘’turning point in the history of independent India’’. At many points in the book, the 13th President of India comes close to justifying the idea of Emergency. 
Mukherjee, who has written four books earlier, describes himself as a ‘’boy who moves from a flickering lamp in a remote village in West Bengal to the glittering chandeliers of the national capital’’. The Dramatic Decade, from Rupa Publications, filled with letters, photographs and extracts from official documents including the Budget of the times, begins with Mukherjee’s home town Mirati, his disinterest in studies as a child and his subsequent Master’s in political science and modern history, and then a degree in law. 
ALSO READ:  From the President's pen: What Rashtrapati Bhavan occupants have written through the decades
He recounts how his father Kamada Kinkar Mukherjee, a Congress loyalist, had reminded him about standing by a person in his or her hour of crisis. It is then that ‘’you reveal your own humanity’’, his father had told him. ‘’I did not, then or later, waver from my loyalty to Indira Gandhi,’’ the President writes. Even as he has been keeping personal diaries over the years, Mukherjee had to depend much on his memory for writing this book as much of his material was lost when his house got flooded.
The chapter on Emergency is titled ‘The Midnight Drama’, where he narrates how, as a minister then, he was urgently called back from Kolkata – then called Calcutta – where he had gone for Rajya Sabha election. Siddhartha Shankar Ray, the then West Bengal chief minister, played an important role in the decision to declare Emergency on the grounds of internal disturbance, according to Mukherjee.
Once Emergency was declared, there were plenty of people claiming authorship of the idea, the book says. Again, ‘’not surprisingly, these same people took a sharp turn’’ later. Ray was no exception, writes Mukherjee. He cites an instance when Ray ran into Indira Gandhi draped in a crimson sari while deposing before the Shah Commission. ‘’You look pretty today,’’ Ray told her. ‘’Despite your efforts,” she retorted.
A large number of ministers and bureaucrats appeared before the Shah Commission, and evidence recorded by the Commission indicated that the Emergency decision was taken by Indira Gandhi alone and the Cabinet was not taken into confidence, the author notes. ‘’The proceedings of the Shah Commission were peculiar…. Suffice it to say that it seemed that the Commission was collecting material and information only to substantiate a pre-conceived conclusion.” 

Bar license bribery case: Vigilance registers case against Kerala minister K MManiWritten by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram |
Posted: December 12, 2014 12:08 am | Updated: December 12, 2014 9:20 am
Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Thursday registered a case against Finance Minister K M Mani in connection with the allegation that he had accepted bribe from a bar hotel owner to renew liquor licence.
Mani, chairman of Christian-dominated regional party Kerala Congress (M), is listed as the first accused.
Mani termed the case as an outcome of a political conspiracy and turned down the Opposition demand that he should quit. Kerala Congress (M) and Congress rallied behind the beleaguered minister, one of the senior leaders of the ruling coalition United Democratic Front. Catholic Church and upper class Hindu Nair leadership too rushed its support for Mani. Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council chairman Cardinal Clemis doubted whether registering a case would make Mani a corrupt politician. Nair leader G Sukumaran Nair said he did not think that Mani was corrupt.
Last month, prominent bar hotel owner and their trade body working president Biju Ramesh levelled the allegation that he had paid a bribe of Rs 1 crore to Mani in two installments against the minister’s demand for Rs 5 crore.
Opposition leader V S Achuthanandan soon rushed a letter to Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala that a case be registered against Mani as per the Prevention of Corruption Act. Accordingly, the VACB went for a quick verification report. Its sleuths recorded the statements of 29 persons and found that prima facie a case could be framed against Mani as per sections 7 and 13 (D) of anti-corruption act. The VACB mainly depended on the statement of Ramesh driver Ambili, who had allegedly gone to Mani’s house in Pala in hand over the money.
While VACB’s quick verification was in the process, two LDF leaders had moved the high court seeking a directive to the agency to register case against Mani. The court rejected the petition, with a rider that VACB director should take a decision based on the quick verification report. The legal adviser at the VACB reported that an FIR could be registered against Mani.
Home Minister Chennithala justified the case, saying that the investigation has to go on to ascertain whether Mani is a culprit or not. Registering a case would not make him an accused, said Chennithala.
LDF would take out a march to the state assembly on December 15, demanding Mani’s resignation.

Uproar continues in Lok Sabha over Agra conversions  Opposition demandsdiscussionBy: Indo-Asian News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 12:57 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 3:44 pm
After days of deadlock on religious conversions in Agra, the Lok Sabha finally agreed to discuss the issue. Leading Congress’ charge in the House, Jyotiraditya Scindia says the government is not serious enough to tackle it.
READ |  Misled into conversion in a Bajrang Dal exercise: Muslim families
Earlier in the day
As soon as the house met for the day, members of the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and CPI-M trooped near the speaker’s podium, and also raised slogans like “Modi sarkaar hosh mein aao” (Wake up, Modi government) and “Hindu-Muslim bhai-bhai”.
Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge asked Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to allow a discussion on the issue.
“You have full powers to suspend the question hour. The government has already agreed to a discussion, kindly allow us,” he said.
Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav said that the matter should be taken “seriously”.
“Otherwise, there might be riots,” he said.
The alleged forcible conversion of about 300 Muslims in Agra echoed in parliament Wednesday as well, with opposition members raising the issue in both houses.
Nearly 300 members of some 60 Muslim families living in a slum on Agra’s outskirts reportedly embraced Hinduism Monday.
The house was briefly adjourned for 10 minutes.

Chinese stocks end lower on slide in brokerages  IPO woesChinese stocks end lower on slide in brokerages, IPO woes
Reuters
Tweet
Shanghai, Dec 11:  
Chinese stocks closed down on Thursday, hit by a slump in brokerages after local media reported that the regulator had set up a team to check brokers’ margin business.
The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell 1.2 per cent, to 3,183.01, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 per cent, to 2,925.74 points.
Sina Financial, a domestic Internet media firm, reported on Thursday that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had set up a special team to investigate brokerages’ margin business and some of them could be punished.
Market liquidity
Investors were also worried over market liquidity after CSRC approved ahead of schedule 12 IPOs late on Wednesday, a move which could cool a blistering rally in the country’s stock markets which has seen the benchmark CSI index surge more than 30 per cent in two weeks.
Western Securities Co dived to its 10 per cent daily limit, with 14 brokerage shares sliding over 5 per cent, including Haitong Securities Co, Founder Securities Co and Guohai Securities Co.
Among the most active stocks in Shanghai were Baotou Steel, up 6.0 per cent at 4.45 yuan; China Shipbuilding, down 0.8 per cent at 8.39 yuan and Hainan Airline, up 9.9 per cent at 3.44 yuan.
In Shenzhen, BOE Technology, down 1.0 per cent at 3.11 yuan; Xingrong Invest, up 10.0 per cent at 7.28 yuan and Changjiang Securities Co, down 3.3 percent ato 14.43 yuan, were among the most actively traded.
Foreign investment flowing into Shanghai from Hong Kong through the mutual market access pilot programme took up 1.07 billion yuan of the 13 billion yuan daily quota.
Total volume of A shares traded in Shanghai was 48.2 billion shares, while Shenzhen volume was 23.5 billion shares.

Uber needs to ensure passenger safety: Yahoo chiefUber needs to ensure passenger safety: Yahoo chief
PTI
Tweet
Washington, Dec 11:  
Uber needs to ensure safety of its passengers in the markets it operates, Yahoo chairman Maynard Webb has said in the aftermath of the California-based ride-sharing company facing backlash in India over the alleged rape of a woman by one of its drivers.
“I think they have to take a look at what are we doing to make sure that passengers are safe wherever they are,” Webb said.
“You have to be in the country and you have to iterate and change and adopt, and you have to have enough of a base to understand what would be the issues.
“Frankly, as bad as that situation is, that same thing could happen with a driver in the US here,” he said in an interview to Bloomberg TV yesterday.
“In all cases you’re getting into somebody else’s vehicle, and the company who provides that service needs to make sure it’s safe. I think that will be something, if I were there I’d be working on in a very big way,” said Webb, who was earlier COO of Ebay.
When Webb was Ebay COO, the India head of his company had to spend weeks behind the bar in India.
“Somebody had put an illegal tape of two teenagers making love on the site and it was quickly taken down, but the police asked him to come down to the police station in a friendly way to give them updates on how he would deal with this in the future, and they locked him up and he stayed locked up for weeks,” he said recollecting the incident.
Webb said thereafter he worked with the then Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, to try to make it all work.
“We worked night and day to try to get him out, and then also try to make sure we modified all of our policies to have this not happen again,” he said.
Responding to Uber facing difficulties in the Indian market after the rape of a woman, he said, problems like this are opportunities for one to make his company far better.
Meanwhile, the move of San Francisco and Los Angeles — the two largest cities in California – to stop Uber operations has been opposed by advocates who fear regulation could put brakes on innovation.
In a joint statement on Tuesday the district attorneys for both cities accused the ride-sharing company of “flagrant and unlawful business practices,” and cited misleading statements about drivers’ background checks as examples.

Agra conversion row: Oppn uproar continues in ParliamentComments
The government offered to bring a law on religious conversion amid opposition pressure in Parliament on Thursday over the Agra controversy and tension in Aligarh and other sensitive areas where hard-line Hindu groups were aggressively pushing ahead their “reconversion” programmes.

“The government is ready to discuss and build a consensus on having a legislation on (religious) conversion,” parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said in the Lok Sabha after Opposition MPs shouted slogans demanding a debate and an adjournment motion on the Agra incident in which 57 poor Muslim families were apparently tricked to switch to Hinduism at a camp hosted by the Dharam Jagaran Samiti and the Bajrang Dal.
The Opposition also demanded an adjournment motion, saying incidents like the one in Agra could ignite riots. “They (organisers of religious conversions) are bringing the country a bad name and sowing seeds of poison,” said Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge.
When Parliament was debating the situation arising out of the Agra incident, an explosive letter surfaced in Agra in which Dharam Jagran Samiti leader Rajeshwer Singh has outlined the target, expenditure and achievement of his organisation to its cadre.
Setting a goal of 50 events this year to convert 100,000 Muslims and Christians, the letter seeks donations to go ahead with its proposed programmes, called ghar wapsi or homecoming ceremonies.
It calls for help from each volunteer to at least fund one event, saying Rs. 5 lakh is required to “reconvert” a Muslim while expenses on problems related to a Christian come to Rs. 2 lakh.
The letter says such ceremonies have “brought back” to Hinduism 40,000 people, including 2,000 Muslims, in 20 districts.
In communally-sensitive Aligarh, the Dharam Jagaran Samiti and the VHP announced their plan to “reconvert” 5,000 Christians and 1,000 Muslims at a function on Christmas.
They said Hindus would be appealed to welcome the “reconverted” Muslims and Christians, who had apparently switched faith from Hinduism some time in history.
Firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, who is the MP for Gorakhpur, and other senior leaders of RSS and VHP offshoots are likely to attend the programme to be held on a college campus.
The Hindu Yuva Vahini that Adityanath had floated, too, has a plan to convert over 2,000 people at a similar programme at Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh on December 18.
Muslim groups and political parties not aligned with the BJP demanded the governments at the Centre and the state to restrain the radical Hindu outfits .
Security in Aligarh was strengthened to prevent any violence. Senior superintendent of police J Ravindra Gaud promised swift action on any complaint of forced conversion.

Putin meets PM Modi  likely to sign pacts on energy  tradePutin backs Make In India with copter, nuclear deals
Jayanth Jacob , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 11, 2014
First Published: 10:47 IST(11/12/2014) | Last Updated: 01:33 IST(12/12/2014)
Comments
Russia offered to help India set up at least 10 more nuclear reactors and manufacture light-utility helicopters  in line with the Make in India campaign as the two countries stepped up their defence and strategic partnership during President Vladimir Putin’s visit on Thursday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Russia would remain India’s most important defence partner and its “unique place in India’s foreign policy will not change” as he laid out a roadmap for stronger energy and business ties between New Delhi and Moscow at their 15th annual summit.
As India and Russia sought to strengthen a once-close relationship, the two countries signed 20 agreements including a contract to implement the third and fourth reactors of the Kudankulam nuclear power plant and a joint investment fund of $1 billion for Indian infrastructure and hydroelectric projects. Other strategic deals covered oil supply, infrastructure and an increase in direct diamond sales to India by Russian firm Alrosa.
Both nations team up to help Afghanistan, eradicate terrorism
“Even as India’s options have increased today, Russia will remain our most important defence partner,” Modi said after the summit. “Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters. It includes the possibility of exports from India. We will follow up on this quickly.”
HT was the first to report that Russia would join Modi’s first big-ticket ‘Make in India’ initiative in the defence sector.
The agreements reflected Russia’s need for allies in the face of Western sanctions over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Though India’s defence cooperation with other countries is expanding, 60% of defence purchases still come from Russia. However, India plans to bring down its dependence on foreign vendors and increase indigenisation of the defence sector as part of the Modi government’s Make in India initiative.
For the chopper deal, public sector unit Hindustan Aeronautics Limited or an Indian private firm could partner for the production of Kamov 226 T helicopters in India as bidding for these reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters is restricted for Indian firms and their joint ventures.
In the first phase, the order could be for 384 helicopters, which could subsequently be increased to 600 to replace the ailing Cheetah/Chetak fleet used by the Indian Army and air force.
The total cost of the project is expected to be over $3 billion.
Modi has also proposed that Russia should manufacture spares and components of Russian defence equipment, a request Putin responded to positively.
Like the defence sector, Russia also aligned nuclear cooperation with Make in India as the two leaders unveiled an ambitious nuclear energy plan to build at least 10 reactors. “It will also include manufacture of equipment and components in India. This also supports our Make in India policy,” Modi said. “Our partnership and the strong sensitivity that we have always had for each other’s interests will be a source of strength to both countries,” the Prime Minister said.
Putin said Russia could eventually supply India with 20 nuclear reactors.
“We highly appreciate the friendship, trust and mutual understanding with Indian partners,” said Putin.

Watch the interview of Prakash Diwan, Director, Altamount Capital Management with Ekta Batra & Anuj Singhal on CNBC-TV18, in which he shared his readings and outlook on market and specific stocks.
Below is the transcript of Prakash Diwan’s interview with Ekta Batra & Anuj Singhal on CNBC-TV18.
Ekta: Do you sense that there could be a further correction and what would you recommend if in case there is a further correction, take the opportunity up?
A: 350 points from a peak which itself was like a very sudden and quick event isn’t something that you need to start getting worried about. In fact all the people who have been waiting on the sidelines, looking at midcaps run up this is the time for them to come back into the market. They have missed out on the chance; you couldn’t get a better chance than this.
Anuj: Do you sense that the chance has come already or would you wait for another 4-5 percent?
A: It is difficult to get the bottom right but every dip is an opportunity. So, you keep on staggering your purchases at lower levels. I won’t be surprised if we also touch 8,000 or sub 8,000 levels once. However, look at what is happening, it is the midcap pack that is seeing a huge churn in terms of what has kind of suddenly got out of favour and all the new stocks that have come in.
However, the Nifty is behaving in a very different way. So, optically it gives you an impression that things are bad but some of the midcaps haven’t lost ground at all. So, you need to look at those kind of companies which you always wanted to buy and they have started getting available at 8-10 percent discounts to their peaks. So, no need to panic but as I said it could still go down. I don’t think it is like the bottom already.
For entire interview watch accompanying video.

Mithil Pradhan of Violet Arc Global Managers told CNBC-TV18, " IFCI is a weak stock. Today it has given a breakdown below the double bottom of Rs 37.60-37.65. There was a lot of consolidation between Rs 37.60 on the top around Rs 40 odd level. This breakdown now opens up downside targets. It can go easily to about Rs 34-35 but then there is no major support till about Rs 32-33. So this will be a short because breakdown has happened today itself."

New Delhi, Dec 11:  
Gold prices were marginally down by 0.2 per cent at Rs 27,270 per 10 grams at the futures trading today after participants offloaded partial positions amid weak cues from the global market.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in far-month April declined by Rs 54 or 0.2 per cent to Rs 27,270 per 10 grams in a business turnover of five lots.
Also, the metal for delivery in February next year shed Rs 50 or 0.18 per cent to Rs 27,141 per 10 grams in 1,232 lots.
Market analysts said trimming of positions by speculators tracking a weak trend in the overseas market mainly put pressure on the precious metal at the futures trade here.
Globally, gold traded 0.18 per cent lower at $1,223.90 an ounce in Singapore today.

Buy Oberoi Realty with target of Rs316Street sees good show after stellar year
Rate ‘buy’ on Oberoi Realty, and maintain a positive bias on the stock driven by gradual improvement in RoE and RoCE to 16% and 21% by FY17e. Current stock price factors many positives as it trades at 24.2x and 10.5x FY16e and FY17e EPS, 1.8x and 1.6x P/B and 14% discount to NAV of R316.
We hold a positive outlook on Mumbai’s real estate market for next 3-4 years. This is on the back of a low base and high pent up demand. Quantitatively, the demand-supply dynamics are favourable for mid-segment products. Yet, affordability remains a essential gap to be bridged.
In terms of launch preparedness (Mulund, JVLR, Borivali, Esquire) and delivery (Exquisite, Commerz II, Worli), Oberoi is well placed. In our view, implementing smart pricing would be the key strategy for success and potential recovery to operational and financial normalcy by FY16-17.
Management highlighted on a sequential improvement in pre-sales velocity in Q3FY15, with further uptick expected in Q4FY15, on the back of launches. We factor FY15e/16e pre-sales at R770 crore and R1100 crore. We defer the revenue recognition from Esquire to FY16 and Worli to FY17 due to possible delay in sales reaching the 25% mark. This translates into 30-40% cut in FY15e/16e EPS estimates.

IndusInd Bank in a sweetspotStreet sees good show after stellar year
Maintain ‘buy’ on IndusInd Bank with price target of R835 per share. We have marginally adjusted our earnings and target price, assuming a slightly faster growth. The bank may look to raise capital earlier than anticipated as growth outlook is looking up. Current Tier-I is at >12%. The stock trades at 3.5x FY16e P/B.
We find the management is becoming more aggressive on its growth outlook – higher branch opening, strong traction in CASA and retail loans, faster increase in NIMs, etc, translating into better RoA/RoEs. Over the next two years, we expect RoAs to be over 2% (currently 1.8%) and RoEs over 20% (currently 18%) and we expect earnings CAGR of 30% for Indusind Bank.
Our key takeaways from the management meeting are: Branch opening is likely to be accelerated from the current run rate of 150 branches to about 225-250 branches per year. From the current CASA of 34%, the bank expects 40% by March 2017. While this looks ambitious, management highlights that its aggressive branch roll out, the success of its product/marketing campaigns makes it fairly confident of moving towards that number.
With improving CASA, declining wholesale rates, loan mix shifting towards retail, margins will clearly inch up starting from Q3FY15 onwards. We are building into our model a 10 bps margin improvement in FY15 and FY16. Asset quality remains stable; Restructured book may increase marginally. Overall credit costs to be limited to 55-60 bps.

US stocks: Wall St declines as energy shares extend recent slideTata Motors sales up 10 pct in December
US stocks extended their declines in afternoon trading on Wednesday as the energy sector resumed its recent slide along with oil prices.
The S&P energy index was down 3.3 percent, the worst performing S&P sector and on track for its fourth drop in five sessions. Brent crude touched a new five-year low of $63.56 on signs of oversupply and soft demand.
Exxon Mobil, down 3.2 percent, led declines on the S&P 500.
Falling oil prices have raised concerns about earnings for energy companies, with year-end tax selling putting additional pressure on the group. The sector, down more than 15 percent for the year so far, is the worst performing of the 10 major S&P sectors for the year.
“Oil seems to be the one theme that has more control over the direction of the market and the degree that volatility emerges than any other theme right now,” said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.
Shares of Yum Brands Inc dropped 4.9 percent a day after it lowered its profit forecast for the year for the second time, hurt by slower-than-expected sales recovery in China following a food safety scare in July.
At 1:43 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 169.64 points, or 0.95 percent, to 17,631.56, the S&P 500 lost 17.52 points, or 0.85 percent, to 2,042.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 32.99 points, or 0.69 percent, to 4,733.48.
Among the day’s gainers were airline shares, including Southwest Airlines, up 4.4 percent and was leading gains on the S&P 500. Barclays said airlines stand to see a decline of about $10 billion in fuel costs in 2015.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,343 to 701, for a 3.34-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,904 issues fell and 743 advanced for a 2.56-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 was posting 32 new 52-week highs and 24 lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 84 new highs and 67 lows.

Energy stocks constitute a big percentage of the Dow Jones index in the US, so the fall in oil prices will impact earnings estimates.
In India, yields on the 10-year bond fell to 7.9 per cent, which is a three-year low. Softening yields is indicates that markets are expecting an earlier-than-expected repo rate cut by the Reserve Bank.

China s CX-1 missile is  not copy of BrahMosIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
A noted defence scientist on Wednesday rejected suggestions that China’s new missile Chaoxun-1 (CX-1) was a copy of Indian supersonic cruise missile BrahMos.
The technology used in CX-1 and BrahMos, an Indo-Russian joint production, was completely different, said A Sivathanu Pillai, who formerly served as Chief Controller of Research and Development at DRDO.
In outward appearance, CX-1 resembles BrahMos, but similarity ends there. Both missiles are different products in terms of engine and other technological parameters. The Chinese missile has nothing to do with BrahMos, he maintained.
Pillai, a Padma Bhushan awardee and founder-CEO and Managing Director of BrahMos Aerospace Pvt Ltd, is also called “the father of BrahMos”.
The distinguished scientist, who was here to take part in a function at IIM-Indore, was talking to reporters on sidelines of the event.
Pillai said it was wrong to speculate that Russia had leaked BrahMos’ technology to China so that the latter could produce a similar missile.
The supersonic cruise missile underwent first successful flight test in 2001 and since then superior versions of the weapon system have been developed, he said.
Pillai said to realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious ‘Make in India’ programme, there was a need to build a military-industry complex in the country in partnership between public and private companies.

Rupee Falls to 62.17/DollarThe rupees fell to 62.17 per dollar against Wednesday's close of 62.02 as risk aversion globally driving some profit-taking in the currency, say traders.
The Indian unit is approaching month's low of 62.25 hit on December 1.
If the rupee falls further to around 62.30, the RBI may step in to sell dollars via state-owned banks, said a trader.
Some dollar demand from oil companies likely in the session to hurt rupee.
The rupee is seen in 62.00 to 62.30 for the day.

SBI chief proposes differential voting rightsSBI chief proposes differential voting rights to meet Basel-III norms
PTI
SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya
New Delhi, Dec 11:  
With the government indicating that it won’t continue to fund public sector banks (PSBs), SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya today said they could look at issuing shares with differential voting rights to raise funds for meeting the Basel-III capital adequacy norms.
“The writing on the wall is very clear...they (PSBs) have to think of differential voting rights. It is time to lay out some kind of roadmap on how much the banks need to do and how much support it would get,” she said, while talking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference.
The government had yesterday allowed PSBs to raise up to Rs 1.6 lakh crore from markets by diluting the government holding to 52 per cent in phases to meet Basel III norms.
Consolidation
Pitching for consolidation in the banking sector, Bhattacharya said that it was important to have three to four major banks.
“It is extremely important for India to have 3-4 major banks. ... We should allow the banks to come together and talk among themselves. In the past also, we have seen government has forced some mergers...it is very important for the banks to determine who should be their correct partners,” she added.
According to Bhattacharya, “it is better to merge good banks with good banks.”
Stake dilution
She further said the government has shown its intent to continue with reforms in the banking sector by deciding to bring down its stake to 52 per cent.
“The news that the government has allowed PSBs to bring down government stake to 52 per cent kicks off the next round of reforms... because for the first time clear signal has been given (to PSBs) to source capital from the market.
“The big daddy back there is not going to be around to give them capital as and when they need. If they need to be competitive and want to grow, then they definitely need to look at other places for more capital,” Bhattacharya added.
Out of 27 PSBs, the Government of India controls 22 through majority holding. In the remaining five, state-run SBI holds majority stake.
Basel III norms
The Basel III norms, which will come into effect from March 31, 2019, were put in place following the 2007-08 financial crisis triggered by the fall of Lehman Brothers.
The norms are aimed at improving risk management and governance, while raising the banking sector’s ability to absorb financial and economic stress.
As per Basel-III norms, the minimum capital level for Tier-1 has to be 7 per cent.

5 reasons why falling oil prices is bad news for Indian oil giants5 reasons why falling oil prices is bad news for Indian oil giants
Dev Chatterjee | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 12:05 PM IST
The Indian oil companies including ONGC, BPCL, Oil India, and RIL had gone on an energy asset buying spree overseas in the last few years with crude oil hovering at above $100 a barrel. But with Brent crude now falling 35% and at its 5-year low of $66 a barrel, the valuation of these assets have fallen sharply by as much as 25%, say analysts.  Here are few reasons why falling oil prices will haunt these companies in 2015: 
No takers:  With valuation of all energy assets falling across the world, many Indian companies including Reliance has put its shale gas assets on the block. RIL is, in fact, expecting $4.5 billion for its 45% in a shale gas JV with Pioneer Natural Resources of USA. The only problem is that there are no takers. If the deal indeed takes place, analysts say, the valuation will be far lower than the expectations. 
Uneconomical fields:  Last year, the government-owned ONGC and Oil India took over 10% stake in Mozambique gas field for $2.5 billion from Videocon. Since then, the valuation of the field is down by as much as 25% say analysts. This means, BPCL, Oil India and ONGC are sitting on an asset whose valuation will continue to fall from its dizzying high of $25 billion of last year.  
Falling Cash flow:  With the oil assets requiring massive dose of investments to keep the wells flowing, falling oil prices would mean lower cash flows. This will impact the cash flows of the companies. Imperial Energy, a company taken over by ONGC is worse off as the $2.1 billion acquisition of Russia-focused Imperial Energy’s oil reserves turned out to be way below projections made prior to the purchase. Falling oil prices will just make matters worse for the company. 
Foreign loans:  As most of these acquisitions abroad have been done via debt taken abroad, any fall in oil prices will make the takeovers more expensive.  The rupee is expected to fall against the US Dollar in 2015 to around Rs 65 to a dollar. This means Indian companies will have to pay more if the loans are to be paid from the cash flows of local companies.  But if these companies have hedged their currency risk, then the risk is not that high.
Faster consolidation:  The last oil fall in the 90s led to a consolidation in the global oil and gas industry with the bigger fish gobbling up smaller ones. While small oil companies will need cash to expand and big ones will need money to prop up their reserves, the Indian companies can either buy out smaller companies at a lower valuation or wait for the tide to turn.  In either case, they will need cash to remain in the business. 

TCS starts performance-based workforce restructuringTCS starts performance-based workforce restructuring, hiring plans on
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 12:35 IST

IT giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is believed to be undertaking a significant performance-related restructuring of its workforce, which may also lead to some employees being asked to leave the company.
Sources said that the restructuring exercise could affect both onsite and offsite positions across various verticals, even as the company said it is on track to meet hiring target of 55,000 professionals this fiscal.
Most affected by the restructuring drive could be middle-to-senior level positions, sources said, while adding that some employees may be offered positions at vendors working with TCS.
The country's largest software exporter with over $13-billion annual turnover employs over 3 lakh people across 46 countries.
When contacted, a TCS spokesperson said, "As a performance driven company, workforce optimisation is a continuous process which happens throughout the year taking into account employee performance, business needs, and people aspirations.
"This leads to some amount of involuntary attrition in the company. This is nothing out of the ordinary or a special situation for us to comment about.
"We continue to be leading recruiters of IT talent across the world, not only in India. In this fiscal year, we have a total hiring target of 55,000 professionals and we are on track to meet it."
At the end of last quarter ended September 30, 2014, TCS had a total headcount of 3,13,757 following a gross employee addition of over 20,000 people.
The headcount utilisation during the quarter stood at 86.2 per cent, excluding trainees, while the figure after including trainees was 81.3 per cent.
The net addition stood at 8,326 employees during the quarter, while its attrition rate was 12.8 per cent.
During the July-September quarter, TCS also crossed a milestone of employing one lakh women professionals with a gender diversity ratio of 32.9 per cent.
The company's net profit declined by 5.8 per cent to Rs 5,244 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal, while revenue rose by 7.7 per cent to Rs 23,816 crore.

Indian-American abortion doctor held in OklahomaIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
A controversial Indian-American physician in the US has been arrested on fraud charges for prescribing abortion-inducing drugs to patients who were not pregnant.
Naresh G Patel, who was arrested yesterday in Oklahoma city, could face up to three years in jail and a maximum fine of USD15,000 if convicted, according to a statement by Attorney General Scott Pruit.
Operating the Outpatient Services for Women clinic in Warr Acres, Patel faces three counts of obtaining money under a false pretence after improperly prescribing abortion-inducing drugs to patients that he falsely identified as pregnant.
Undercover agents from the Oklahoma Medical Licensure Board, the Oklahoma City Police Department and the Attorney General’s Office set up appointments with Patel where the doctor performed ultrasounds and pregnancy tests on the women, where he is alleged to have fraudulently identified each undercover agent as pregnant.
Afterward, he prescribed them an abortion-inducing drug, provided directions for administering it and charged the female agents for the unnecessary treatment, the attorney’s office said.
“This type of fraudulent activity and blatant disregard for the health and well-being of Oklahoma women will not be tolerated.
“Oklahoma women should be able to trust that the advice they receive from their physicians is truthful, accurate and does not jeopardise their health,” said Pruit.
He said: “This investigation is a textbook demonstration of inter-agency cooperation to protect Oklahomans and prosecute the worst offenders,” he said.

Lok Sabha adjourned briefly on Muslims conversion issue in AgraIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
Opposition today created uproar in Lok Sabha over the issue of religious conversion in Agra, prompting the government to say it was ready to build a consensus on having a legislation on conversion.
As soon as the House met for the day, Opposition members belonging to Congress, TMC, SP, RJD and AAP came to the Well demanding suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue of alleged religious conversions and re-conversions.
Speaker Sumitra Mahajan declined to suspend Question Hour, saying she would allow Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge to speak during Zero Hour and if necessary allow a discussion.
Her repeated pleas did not yield any result and the opposition continued to protest and raise the slogan ‘Hindu, Muslim, Sikhs bhai bhai’.
While members belonging to NCP, AIMIM and Left parties kept protesting from aisle, the Question Hour continued with most of the questions being taken up.
Acknowledging that it is a serious issue, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said, “Government is ready to discuss and build a consensus on having a legislation on (religious) conversion.”
Kharge said the matter should be taken up as a special case. “It is a very, very serious matter and there is threat to the unity of the country,” he said.
He said religious conversions are happening and everybody is giving statements outside the House and even encouraging such things.
Countering the allegation, Naidu said, “There is no problem to safety, unity and integrity of the country… Don’t politicise the issue.”
SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav also spoke something which was not audible.
As the din continued, the Speaker said proper notice should be given as the government has already expressed its willingness to discuss the matter.
“You are interested in slogans only, you are not interested in discussions… This is not the proper way,” she told the protesting members.
With the Speaker not accepting the opposition demand, Kharge wondered whether the discussion should take place on the streets.
As the pandemonium continued, Mahajan adjourned the House for 10 minutes till 12.05 PM.

Yann LeCun, who heads the Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (Fair) lab, and his team are now laying the basic groundwork for the tool.
LeCun wants to build a kind of Facebook digital assistant that will recognise when you are uploading an embarrassing photo from a late-night party.
In a virtual way, LeCun said, this assistant would tap you on the shoulder and say: “Uh, this is being posted publicly. Are you sure you want your boss and your mother to see this?”
Such a tool would rely on image recognition technology that can distinguish between your drunken self and your sober self, ‘Wired’ reported.
The larger aim, LeCun said, is to create things like the digital assistant that can closely analyse not only photos but all sorts of other stuff posted to Facebook.
“You need a machine to really understand content and understand people and be able to hold all that data,” he said.
LeCun’s Facebook lab has already developed algorithms that examine a user’s overall Facebook behaviour in an effort to identify the right content for their news feed — content they are likely to click on — and they will soon analyse the text users type into status posts, automatically suggesting relevant hashtags.
LeCun and his team are also looking towards AI systems that can understand Facebook data in more complex ways.
“Imagine that you had an intelligent digital assistant which would mediate your interaction with your friends and also with content on Facebook,” LeCun said.
LeCun also envisions a Facebook that instantly notifies you when someone you don’t know posts your photo to the social network without your approval.

Khap panchayats are illegal and unconstitutional  says govtIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
Government today termed all ‘customary courts’ like Khap panchayats as illegal and unconstitutional and asked state governments to check such set up as it was a serious issue.
Law Minister D V Sadananda Gowda told Lok Sabha that all ‘customary courts’, Khap panchayats and kangaroo courts are “against the law and against the Constitution”.
“It is a very serious issue. State governments have to take action and check such customary courts,” he said during Question Hour.
Gowda was replying a supplementary Rabindra Kumar Jena (BJD) who raised the issue of such a court in West Bengal.
The Minister said he would soon write to all states for setting up of ‘Naari Aadalat’ (women courts) for expeditious disposals of cases related to women.
Gowda said the Central government was ready to provide assistance to state governments for setting up of free legal aid cell to help poor and weaker sections of the society.
He said government was committed to providing free legal services to the poor and weaker sections of the society such as members of SC, ST, women and children.
Under the Legal Services Authorities Act 1987, persons belonging to SC, ST, a victim of trafficking, a woman, a child, a person with disability, an industrial workman are entitled to free legal services irrespective of their economic or social status, he said.

Govt open to detailed discussion in Parliament on conversion issueGovt open to detailed discussion in Parliament on conversion issue: Naidu
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 02:15 PM IST
Government today said it is open to a detailed discussion in Parliament on the issue of alleged forced reconversion and if all parties agree it could even bring a legislation to ban conversions.
Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs M Venkaiah Naidu said that the NDA government is keen on discussing all issues.
"With regard to conversion and reconversion, if the Opposition wants to have a discussion, we are ready to have a detailed discussion in the House. We are also willing, if at all there is all party support, let there be a legislation also to ban conversion because this has been the wish of Mahatama Gandhi," he said.
"That being the case, let the Parliament of India discuss the issue threadbare and then come to a conclusion together. Let all the states and Centre together tackle this task about conversions and reconversions," the Minister said.
Hitting out at the Opposition, Naidu said it is not befitting for them to find an issue everyday to create "political hungama" to attack the government.
"If you are really sincere, give a notice, take permission from the Speaker and have a discussion," Naidu advised the Opposition parties. He reminded that Mahatama Gandhi had said proselytising is an enemy of the nation.
"If the House agrees, the government will have no problem in bringing an anti-conversion bill," he said.
BJP MP Kirti Azad said that there cannot be forceful conversions and in India people have been converting and reconverting for hundreds of years.
"The Uttar Pradesh Government should take action on it if anything wrong is going on. Why should it be made an issue to bring the nation to a standstill," he said.

Trashed laptop batteries to power homesTrashed laptop batteries to power homes
IANS     New York   Last Updated: December 10, 2014  | 14:06 IST
Researchers, including an Indian-origin scientist, from IBM have used discarded laptop batteries to create an emergency lighting system called UrJar for street vendors and houses located in slums in Bengaluru.
The team, along with a hardware firm RadioStudio, tested three-year-old batteries discarded by an IT company and found that they had enough capacity to power LED (Light Emitting Diode) lights, a small fan or even a mobile charger.
Cutting open the battery packs, and extracting individual cells that could still work, the team reconnected them to make new power units.
Using these battery packs, three UrJar prototypes were created which were handed out to participants to test for some time.
The prototypes come at an average cost of Rs.600, the team found, including an enclosure, the electronics, an LED light bulb and a mobile charger.
"The most costly component in these systems is often the battery," Vikas Chandan from IBM was quoted as saying in the journal MIT Technology Review.
In this case, the most expensive part of your storage solution is coming from trash, he added.

Tata Motors aims to double passenger-car sales networkTata Motors looks to double passenger car sales network by 2020
PTI     Udaipur   Last Updated: December 10, 2014  | 19:19 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
Tata Motors plans to almost double its dealer network in the country by 2020, targeting rural areas and cities alike, as the company looks to claw back to a dominant position in the domestic passenger car market.
Tata Motors, which currently has around 500 touch points across the country, aims to add equal number of dealerships to expand its presence.
India is a hugely diverse country. There are around 6.5 villages, 3,000 towns with a population of more than 50,000 people and over 3,800 tehsils. We are trying to go as much near to the customers, Tata Motor's President for passenger vehicle business Mayank Pareek told PTI.
So, the auto maker is embarking on expansion of the network across the length and width of the country, he added.
Noting that by 2020 the passenger car market will touch 5 million units per annum-mark, doubling from the current 2.5 million market, Pareek said that the car maker was looking at doubling its network by then.
When asked about expansion in rural areas, Pareek said, "In rural areas we need to expand more as there is upsurge in the market. Aspirations of people are growing as roads are getting connected."
For Tata Motors, rural sales currently account for around 15 per cent of total sales while some other players are getting as much as 30 per cent of their sales from rural areas, he added.
There is also a huge affinity towards Tata Motors brand in the smaller towns, which Tata Motors could leverage on, Pareek said.
Commenting on the new launches, Pareek said, "Indian car market is growing. Earlier there used to be just A and B segments but look now we have so many segments. So there will be demand and we would need to bolster the existing portfolio as well as enter new segments."
He said soon to be launched compact car 'Bolt' would ensure the company's re-entry into the hatchback segment.
After getting a good response to its compact sedan Zest , the company is all set to launch Bolt in the near future.
When asked about plans for the entry level Tata Nano, Pareek said, "It is a relevant product for us and there are exciting possibilities. He, however, did not share further details."
With government all set to bring in mandatory crash testing norms for passenger cars, Pareek said Tata Motors is ready to comply with the new norms.

Sri Lankan navy arrests 27 Tamil Nadu fishermenBy: Press Trust of India | Rameswaram |
Posted: December 11, 2014 9:28 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 11:50 am
Sri Lankan navy detained 27 fishermen from Tamil Nadu overnight, accusing them of poaching in the island nation’s waters, and released them on Thursday morning with a warning.
While 13 fishermen from Jagadapattinam in Thanjavur district were detained along with three boats, 14 fishermen from Rameswaram were held with their three boats when they were fishing in the mid-sea late last night.
The Lankan navy personnel also damaged their fishing nets, Assistant Director of Fisheries Department Sekar said. The fishermen, who were taken to Kankesanthurai naval base, were released Thursady morning after a warning not to fish in the Sri Lankan waters, Sekhar said.
Fishermen from Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Karaikal, Thanjavur and Pudukottai had decided to boycott fishing indefinitely from Thursday in protest against the incident.

New battery generates power from waste heatUpdated: December 11, 2014 09:47 IST
New battery generates power from waste heat
Unlike conventional batteries, a new ammonia-based battery turns low-grade waste heat into electricity.
Researchers have developed a new ammonia—based battery system to convert low—grade waste heat into electricity.
“The use of waste heat for power production would allow additional electricity generation without any added consumption of fossil fuels,” said Professor Bruce E Logan from the Pennsylvania State University.
“Thermally regenerative batteries are a carbon—neutral way to store and convert waste heat into electricity with potentially lower cost than solid—state devices,” said Dr. Logan.
Low—grade waste heat is an artifact of many energy—generating methods. In automobiles, waste heat generated in winter is diverted to run the vehicle heating system, but in the summer.
Using low—grade waste heat from an outside source, the researchers distill ammonia from the effluent left in the battery anolyte and then recharge it into the original cathode chamber of the battery.
The chamber with the ammonia now becomes the anode chamber and copper is re—deposited on the electrode in the other chamber, now the cathode, but formerly the anode.
The researchers switch ammonia back and forth between the two chambers, maintaining the amount of copper on the electrodes.
“Here we present a highly efficient, inexpensive and scalable ammonia—based thermally regenerative battery where electrical current is produced from the formation of copper ammonia complex,” the researchers said.
Researchers note that the ammonia liquid stream can convert the thermal energy to electrical energy in the battery.
"When needed, the battery can be discharged so that the stored chemical energy is effectively converted to electrical power,” they said.
The thermally regenerative ammonia battery system can convert about 29 per cent of the chemical energy in the battery to electricity and can be greatly improved with future optimisation.
The researchers produced a power density of about 60 watts per square metre over multiple cycles, which is six to 10 times higher than the power density produced by other liquid—based thermal—electric energy conversion systems.
The researchers note that the current thermally regenerative ammonia battery is not optimised, so that tinkering with the battery could both produce more power and reduce the cost of operating the batteries.
The researchers were able to increase power density by increasing the number of batteries, so that this method is scalable to something that might be commercially attractive.
The study was published in the journal Energy and Environmental Science.

Brent Crude Oil Below $65/Barrel on OPEC ReportYou are here: Home Commodities
Brent Crude Oil Below $65/Barrel on OPEC Report
Associated Press | Updated On: December 11, 2014 09:28 (IST)
Jet Fuel Rates Cut Sharply by 12.5%
The price of oil took another dive Wednesday, plunging to five-year lows amid mounting evidence that global supplies are far outstripping demand.
The U.S. Energy Department reported a surprise increase in domestic oil inventories and OPEC projected that demand for its crude would sink next year to levels not seen in more than a decade.
Benchmark U.S. crude slumped 4.5 per cent, or $2.88, to close at $60.94 a barrel on Wednesday. Prices have not been that low since July of 2009. U.S crude prices have fallen 17 per cent in two weeks and are now 43 per cent below the $107.26 that a barrel fetched at its peak this year.
Brent crude, an international benchmark used to price oil used in many U.S. refineries, fell $1.95 to close at $64.24 in London.
Energy analyst and trader Stephen Schork said in an interview that he expects that the combination of weak economic news out of Asia and growing global supplies will push oil down further, to below $60, by the end of the week. "It's the proverbial 'trying to catch a falling dagger' and I'm not going to try to catch it," he said.
OPEC said Wednesday that it expects demand for its crude to fall to 28.9 million barrels per day next year, 400,000 barrels per day less than in 2014. The cartel's official production target is 30 million barrels a day, which would mean far more oil on the world market than is being consumed.
Also on Wednesday, the Energy Department reported a surprise increase in U.S. crude supplies of 1.5 million barrels last week. Analysts were expecting a decline of 2.2 million barrels. Gasoline stocks also increased more than expected.
Falling oil prices are making for sharply lower prices of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, giving consumers, shippers and airlines a lift.
Economists say lower gasoline prices act like a tax cut, leaving more money in consumers' pockets to spend on other things. The national average price of gasoline fell Wednesday to $2.64, according to AAA, saving drivers $1.05 per gallon compared to what they were paying in late June.
The Energy Department projected in a report Tuesday that gasoline will average $2.60 per gallon next year, 23 percent below this year's projected average. If that comes to pass, it will save a typical household $550 next year.
Lower oil prices are taking their toll on oil producers, though, sending company shares plummeting and forcing companies to cut spending. BP said Wednesday it would aim to cut costs by $1 billion next year, a move that would likely involve significant job cuts.
In other futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange:
- Wholesale gasoline fell 8.2 cents to close at $1.642 a gallon.
- Heating oil fell 3.8 cents to close at $2.046 a gallon.
- Natural gas rose 5.4 cents to close at $3.706 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Students to record effect of climate change via mobile appBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata |
Posted: December 11, 2014 11:39 am
Hundreds of students from the four cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad are coming together to document how climate change is impacting trees, birds and butterflies around them in urban areas. Using mobile applications as part of a citizen science project by Mumbai-based social enterprise Ladybird Environmental Consulting, they are trying to engage around 3,000 students across 40 schools in the cities.
With the help of WWF, they have tied up with ten schools in Kolkata whose students will click photographs and take notes on the changes they see in the urban bio-diversity landscape. For trees they would collect data on the pattern of the fall of their leaves, fruiting and flowering seasons – all indicators of the impact of climate change.
“All this information will be collated for a period of five years during which we will have substantial data to understand the impact of climate change in the four cities,” Dr V Shubhalaxmi, who has conceptualised the project, told PTI here. All the data and images collected would be uploaded by the students on the three apps – iBirds, iButterflies and iTrees – which would go live on Android devices from tomorrow.
Easy to find in cities, birds, butterflies and trees are known as indicators of climate change as they are among the most affected by any changes in the climate. West Bengal Biodiversity Board’s chairman Dr Ashok Sanyal said Kolkata alone has around 89 species of butterflies, 400 types of plants and 40 species of birds.
“We need to conserve our biodiversity as it is disappearing fast,” he said. Besides school students, the mobile app would also be useful for anyone interested in connecting with nature. It would have all details and photographs to help a mobile user identify 50 common species of birds, butterflies and trees.
Schools participating in the ‘Urban iNaturewatch Challenge’ have made it a part of their students’ project work asking students to give one hour every week in exploring nature around them. Students would work either during nature trails within the city or explore biodiversity near their school or home.
As students are not allowed to carry mobiles in school campuses, the teachers would help them with a device dedicated for the project. Although amateurs would generate the primary data using the app but it would be validated only by experts. Shubhalaxmi, who has been working as a nature educator for many years, said the idea came to her after realising that the next generation learners are glued to technology and gadgets.
“No one wants to take field biology as a career. We want to nurture young talent through this initiative,” she said adding that the project aligns with UN’s Decade of Biodiversity (2011-2020).

Several solar power projects announced | Solar can be for India what shale is for USNarendra Modi
(The Cabinet approved setting…)
NEW DELHI: Moving ahead on Narendra Modi government's mission to push solar power initiatives, the Cabinet approved several projects including solar parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects across the country.
"The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the scheme for setting up of 1000 MW of Grid-Connected Solar PV Power Projects with VGF (Viability Gap Fund) support of Rs 1000 crore, by CPSUs under various Central/State Schemes, in three years period from 2015-16 to 2017-18," a press release said. "The scheme will have a mandatory condition that all PV cells and modules used in solar plants set up under this Scheme, will be made in India," the release stated.
The Cabinet approved setting up of 25 solar parks of 500 MW capacity each, as also Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects, which will require central government financial support of Rs 4,050 crore.
The solar parks will be set up across the country during five years, from fiscal 2014-15 to 2018-19. The solar parks will be developed in collaboration with state governments and their agencies and the choice of implementing agency for developing and maintaining the park would also be decided by the state government.
The scheme will have a mandatory condition that all PV cells and modules used in solar plants set up under this scheme will be made in India.
All states and Union Territories will be eligible for benefitting under the scheme, while solar parks will enable development of solar power in remote areas where land is inexpensive, the government said in a post-cabinet statement.
As a transmission system will be developed for the entire Park, developers will not have to set up their own transmission lines. This will not only save money but will also avoid damaging the landscape of the area as only limited transmission lines would be laid.
Further developers would be able to set up projects quickly as they will not have to get statutory and other clearances.
To promote energy security and ecologically sustainable growth, the government also gave the green signal for installation of solar power plants in defence and paramilitary establishments by utilising available area.
The Cabinet gave its approval for setting up over 300 MW of grid-connected solar PV power projects by defence establishments and paramilitary forces in the country under an ambitious solar mission of the government.
The Cabinet gave its approval for "setting up over 300 MW of grid-connected and off-grid Solar PV Power Projects by defence establishments under Defence Ministry and paramilitary forces under Home Ministry with VGF under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) in five years--that is from 2014 to 2019," the release said.
The Cabinet approved provision of an amount of Rs 750 crore for Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) from the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) for the purpose.
It also granted permission for right to use defence land by the developers chosen by defence establishments by way of lease and otherwise or for self-use of the same by defence establishments themselves, for the purpose of setting up of solar power projects and sale of excess power to distribution companies.
The defence organisations will be free to own the power projects or get a developer who makes the investment and supplies power at a fixed tariff of Rs 5.50 per unit, the release said.
The use of domestically manufactured equipment will boost indigenous production of solar cells and modules, it said, adding, the defence sector will be able to get clean power at reasonable price for 25 years.

ED questions Maran brothers in Aircel-Maxis caseRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
Taking forward the money laundering probe in the Aircel-Maxis deal, the Enforcement Directorate has questioned the Maran brothers – Dayanidhi and Kalanithi – in connection with its criminal case against them.
Sources said the investigators, early this week, recorded the statements of Dayanidhi, the former Telecom Minister, and his businessman brother Kalanithi here after they were issued notices in October this year.
“Both the Marans have been questioned and their statements recorded under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. They could be summoned again,” sources said.
The duo were questioned about their personal and official financial dealings and on specific charges related to the deal.
Some documents submitted by them are being scrutinised, they said.
Officials said the fresh questioning of the Marans was essential as the ED is expected to issue an attachment order for seizing of assets of an estimated value of over Rs 700 crore in this case and all questions regarding criminal actions had to be answered by those involved and booked, they said.
Other executives involved in the deal are also now being questioned, they said.
The ED is probing the case based on a CBI FIR in the matter.
Besides the Maran brothers, the CBI has named Malaysian business tycoon T Ananda Krishnan, Malaysian national Augustus Ralph Marshall and four firms – Sun Direct TV, Maxis Communication Berhad, Astro All Asia Network and South Asia Entertainment Holding – as accused.
The CBI has charged them with the offences punishable under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
The CBI had alleged in the court that Dayanidhi Maran had “pressured” and “forced” Chennai-based telecom promoter C. Sivasankaran to sell his stakes in Aircel and two subsidiary firms to Malaysian firm Maxis Group in 2006.
The ED’s money laundering case is based on this.

Arun Jaitley to Push GST Bill in Crucial Meet Today: 10 FactsFinance Minister Arun Jaitley will meet state government representatives on Thursday in a bid to build a consensus on the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The government wants to roll out the GST by April 2016.
Here is your 10-point cheet sheet to the story:
1) The GST will cut down the large number of taxes imposed by the central government and states and will lead to the creation of a unified market, which would facilitate seamless movement of goods across states and reduce the transaction cost of businesses.
2) But many state governments have been opposing the introduction of the GST Bill because they fear it will lead to a loss of revenue.
3) In particular, states want petroleum, alcohol and tobacco to be kept out of the purview of the GST as these items account for a major portion of tax revenues.
4) There is no consensus on the final GST tax rates yet and recommendations vary from 16 per cent to 27 per cent.
5) The GST roll out has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over such crucial issues.
6) The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, has lapsed and the Modi government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
7) The government needs to take states on board because the GST Bill requires the consent of 50 per cent of states for implementation.
8) In a bid to assuage state governments' concerns, Mr Jaitley on Wednesday announced a proposal to pay Rs 11,000 crore as part payment of dues towards central sales tax compensation pending from 2010-11. This is roughly one-third of the total dues. The balance amount will be paid starting next financial year, Mr Jaitley said.
9) The Finance Ministry has also proposed to compensate states for three years for losses they may incur on account of switching to the GST regime, as against a demand for five-year compensation.
10) If successful, economists say the implementation of GST could add 2 percentage points to GDP growth.

Telecom industry calls for more spectrum in February auctions
ET Bureau Dec 11, 2014, 12.29PM IST

2G airwaves
("It is critical that the…)
NEW DELHI: The telecom commission's decision to increase the reserve price of both the 2G airwaves isn't that much of a concern for the industry as is the availability of more spectrum in the 900 Mhz for the Februray sale, say industry and analysts.
"It is critical that the telecom department increases the quantum of 900 Mhz to be auctioned in the upcoming February auctions," Rajan Mathews, director general of GSM industry body COAI , told ET. He however welcomed the broad decision of the commission, the highest decision making body in the telecom department (DoT), to expand the supply of 900 Mhz airwaves for commercial use by private operators.
Mathews reiterated that the government must also auction 3G airwaves (2100 Mhz) along with the 800 Mhz, 900 Mhz and the 1800 Mhz in the upcoming auctions.
The stocks of all the three listed companies Bharti Airtel , Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications underperformed on the Bombay Stock Exchange during the last one month as uncertainty regarding auctions loomed large. Result Bharti's stock prices fell over 12% since the beginning of November, closing at Rs 396 on Wednesday. Idea Cellular's stock also fell 12% in the same period, ending at Rs 142.50 and so did Reliance Communications' stock which again fell 12% closing at Rs 95.60.
The telecom commission, in its meeting on December 8, had specifically said that while the supply of 900 Mhz must be increased by exploring various measures as suggested by the telecom regulator, it must be delinked from the issue of the upcoming spectrum auctions.
The government has scheduled a sale of airwaves in the 800Mhz, 900 Mhz and the 1800 Mhz in February. It hopes to mop up at least Rs 9,355 crore from these auctions.
The telecom commission on Monday suggested a hike of 23% in the reserve price of 900 Mhz band and another 17% in the price of the 800 Mhz band over the telecom regulator's recommendations. The reserve price of 1800 Mhz band has marginally increased. The commission proposed a price of Rs 3,693 crore per Mhz for 900 Mhz band, Rs 2,191 crore a unit for the 1800 Mhz band and Rs 3,646 crore a Mhz for the 800 Mhz band.
The auctions are scheduled to begin in February next year.
CDMA technology operator, Sistema Shyam Teleservices, has already said that such an increase would go against the PM's vision of Digital India and broadband for all, as the proposed price didn't make any business sense.
On the issue of 2100 Mhz band, the commission said it noted the telecom department's efforts for harmonisation of the 1800 Mhz band and the release of spectrum in the 2100 Mhz band by defence.
The telecom commission's proposal will now be sent to the telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for an approval.
The commission has increased the price for 900 Mhz and the 800 Mhz band on the view that the Trai's premise of capping the valuation of the 900 Mhz airwaves at two times that of the 1800 Mhz band might not be fully correct. For 800 Mhz band, the inter-ministerial panel has proposed an increase in the reserve price of airwaves in the metros and the category A circles.
However, in what will bring respite to the telecom industry , the commission has asked the telecom department to reconsider the regulator's proposals on expanding the supply of the coveted 900 Mhz band by taking it back from the state-run PSU, BSNL.
It has also asked the telecom department to consider the regulator's proposal on further expanding the supply of the 900 Mhz band by exploring the extended GSM band. Both these proposals had been rejected by the telecom department earlier.
The re-examined view will be placed with the telecom commission in its next meeting.

(The leader of Crimea, arrived…)
NEW DELHI: The leader of Crimea, the former Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia, arrived for unofficial talks in New Delhi on Thursday as President Vladimir Putin met Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a summit.
Sergey Aksyonov met a Mumbai businessman to discuss boosting trade with the Black Sea region. India does not support Western sanctions against Russia, but the meeting may prove an irritant before President Barack Obama visits India in January.
Russian officials declined to comment, but a senior diplomat arrived with Aksyonov at an upscale New Delhi hotel for the meeting to sign a memorandum with a business group called the Indian-Crimean Partnership.
Gul Kripalani, a seafood merchant who chairs the group, told Reuters before the meeting that it was unofficial, but added that Aksyonov "happened to be on the flight with His Excellency President Putin".
A spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs said he was not officially aware of the Crimean visit and that Aksyonov was not a member of Putin's delegation.
India has made it clear that it would not support Western sanctions against Russia imposed over the annexation of Crimea in February, and the Kremlin's support for an armed uprising in by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.

FY15 sales guidance revised to 12-14% Vs 25%: TTK PrestigeIn an interview to CNBC-TV18, TT Jagannathan, chairman,  TTK Prestige spoke about the company’s performance in the quarter gone by and business outlook going ahead.
Below is the verbatim transcript of TT Jagannathan's interview with Ekta Batra & Anuj Singhal on CNBC-TV18.
Anuj: So far we haven’t seen any kind of improvement in economic data and consumption pattern. What is your call for the second half of the year? Do you think performance would remain muted?
A: It will remain muted. Diwali was a flop. We expected substantial Diwali but it was by 10 percent growth over last year. I believe that the year is going to end muted.
Ekta: Can you give us a sense in terms of the quarter gone by, what stood out were your margins which declined around 80 bps to 12.1 percent. Can you give us a sense in terms of what margins you are working in this quarter which is in the Q3 and maybe what the trend also would be?
A: Our gross margins have not declined. When the topline does not grow more than 10 percent it appears that the EBITDA margin decline but it’s actually the inflation that is eating into overhead cost. Going forward in the year we expect to end up again at 12.2 percent growth.
Anuj: That is interesting because you are saying that inflation is eating into cost. Your last quarter margins were also down 12.1 percent. You do not have pricing power right now, are you losing it. What sense do you get when you look at the current business scenario?
A: Unless prices move up by more than 5 percent we do not take price increase. You cannot take price increase every week.
Ekta: What about the topline because the last time we had spoken the guidance was around 25 percent sales growth. In Q1 your sales were up 10 percent, in Q2 your sales were up 10.5 percent. What do you think the second half is looking like? Do you think that you can stick by 25 percent guidance unless it’s already revised?
A: I corrected that about four months ago. We corrected that to about 15 percent and now the year will end between 12 and 15 percent.
Anuj: Could you give us some outlook for next financial year?
A: It’s too early to predict.
Anuj: Any particular regions where you are seeing sustained impact of slowdown or is it broad based across various geographies?
A: It is broad based, it’s national.
Ekta: What about the southern markets. There were regional concerns, the power deficit which was impacting your performance there. Has that eased out?
A: It has eased out but not to the extent it expected because power situation in Tamil Nadu is still very bad.
Ekta: Any plan that you would be undertaking for the Tamil Nadu market, for example have you curtail sales, any precautionary steps that the management has had to take or is going to take because of the situation there?
A: On the contrary we are very aggressive. We want to gain market share.
Ekta: What would your market share be totally right now within the entire market as compared to the previous quarter?
A: We are operating in about ten different segments and each segment has different market share.

Japan automakers add 550,000 cars to Takata air bag recalls

(The recalls announced on…)
TOKYO: Three Japanese automakers will recall more than half a million cars globally to replace air bag inflators made by Takata Corp , bringing the total tally of Takata-related recalls across all brands to around 20 million since 2008.
The recalls announced on Thursday by Honda Motor, Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors correspond with a similar, precautionary recall by Toyota Motor last week after a recent "unusual deployment" of a passenger-side air bag at a scrap yard in Japan.
Honda, Takata's biggest customer, said it would recall an estimated 400,000 vehicles globally, including about 177,000 in Japan across 11 models such as the Stream minivan, Fit subcompact and Civic hybrid produced in 2003.
The rest include about 100,000 in Europe and 70,000 in Asia-Pacific, and none in the United States , Honda said.
A spokeswoman said Honda would need to set aside more reserves to pay for the latest recalls, as well as the voluntary expansion to the rest of the world of a region-specific recall that had been limited to certain hot and humid areas in the United States.
She said she could not disclose a specific figure.
Honda has now recalled about 13.4 million vehicles globally for Takata air bag inflators since 2008 - about half of those to investigate what could be the root cause of the defects. U.S. regulators last month ordered Takata to move forward with a nationwide expansion of the regional recall, but Takata has refused, effectively putting the onus for voluntary recalls on the car makers.
Honda said that if the cause is identified and Takata is at fault, it would negotiate a return of some or all of the recall costs from Takata.
NISSAN, MITSUBISHI
The recalls were triggered by an unusual explosion of a Takata air bag inflator in a 2003-model Toyota Will Cypha at a scrapyard in central Japan last month. Toyota recalled 185,000 vehicles from 2003 that were equipped with the same type of inflator, made at Takata's Monclova factory in Mexico.
Nissan estimated its global recall would cover 152,000 cars, including 82,000 in Japan, 49,000 in Europe and 6,000 in China for 2003 and 2004 model-year vehicles. Mitsubishi will recall 304 Lancer sedans in Japan only.
A total of about 3.05 million vehicles have now been recalled in Japan by a dozen automakers.
Nissan separately recalled 250,000 Note, March and Latio cars in Japan to fix faulty side-view mirrors.

159 stocks hit three-month low in December175 stocks hit 3-month lows in December
Deepak Korgaonkar & Puneet Wadhwa | Mumbai/New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 10:44 PM IST
Reliance Industries, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Bharti Airtel, Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite, Cairn India and Wipro are among 175 stocks that have hit a three-month low as the S&P BSE Sensex slipped over 1,000 points thus far in December.
The S&P BSE Sensex that closed to 27,602 on Thursday has lost 1,092 points from its record closing high of 28,694 on November 28. The 50-share CNX Nifty Index has also declined 295 points at 8,293 from its lifetime high 8,588. The fall has seen around 175 stocks from the BSE-500, mid-cap and small-cap index touch their respective three-month low level during the current month.
Among individual stocks, Idea Cellular, Reliance Communications, Reliance Power, Adani Enterprises, Aban Offshore, Arvind, Housing Development and Infrastructure (HDIL), Hindustan Copper, TTK Prestige and Balkrishna Industries are among few notable shares touched three-month low on the BSE on Thursday.
Bajaj Electrical, Tata Sponge Iron, Aban Offshore, Hindustan Oil Exploration, Amtek India, Reliance Power, Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra), Hindustan Copper, Reliance Communications and HCL Infosystems are among 50 stocks that saw over 50 per cent market value erosion from their 52-week highs.
"Since the past few months, the markets have seen a sharp up move and a correction was overdue. The Indian markets are moving in line with their global peers that have seen a decent correction off late. I think once there is a reversal in the trend globally, Indian markets will also rebound. They will take directional cues from inflation data to be released this week and the outcome of the US Federal Reserve's meeting scheduled for the next week," said Rikesh Parikh, vice-president for market strategy at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
The fall in metal and mining stocks comes on the back of weak Chinese trade data. China's exports rose 4.7 per cent in November, well below expectations and adding to concerns that it could be facing a sharper slowdown.
"Though a slowdown in China will impact metal and mining stocks, there are overall positives for the Indian economy, as it will keep a check on commodity prices that serve as a raw material for a number of sectors. We remain underweight on the metal space," says Mihir Vora, director and chief investment officer, Max Life Insurance.
On the other hand, ONGC, Cairn India, Aban Offshore, Hindustan Oil Exploration and Selan Exploration have been impacted by a steady decline in crude oil prices.
Analysts say the recent fall in the markets presents a good opportunity for investors to accumulate stocks from a long - term perspective.
"The current market situation, both on domestic and global front, is pointing towards this decline to extend further. However, we reiterate our view that investors should be utilise this fall to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong counters. On the other hand, traders should maintain cautious approach as we generally see stocks in mid-cap and small-cap segment decline sharply during such corrections. So, maintain stock-specific stop losses and avoid averaging your loss making positions," points out Jayant Manglik, president - retail distribution, Religare Securities in a recent note.

Aluminium weakens by 0.1% on low spot demandAluminium weakens by 0.1% on low spot demand
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 12:40 PM IST
Aluminium prices traded marginally down by 0.08% to Rs 121.25 per kg in futures trading today as speculators reduced exposure amid sluggish demand from consuming industries in the spot market.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, aluminium for delivery in December shed 10 paise, or 0.08% to Rs 121.25 per kg in business turnover of 548 lots.
Similarly, the metal for delivery in January next year traded lower by 5 paise, or 0.04% to Rs 122.15 per kg in 14 lots.
Analysts said off-loading of positions by speculators due to subdued demand in the spot markets from consuming industries and weakness in copper and other base metals at the London Metal Exchange, mainly put pressure on aluminium prices at futures trade.

(Shares of sugar companies…)
MUMBAI: Shares of sugar companies surged in early trade after the government fixed a price of Rs 48.50-49.50 per litre for procurement of ethanol for blending with petrol.
The rate is much higher than the price oil companies presently pay to buy the sugarcane extract.
Oil firms presently pay about Rs 29/litre for ethanol. The Food Ministry had said that ex-sugar mill price of ethanol is around Rs 42.02 per litre. For ethanol suppliers, the landed cost of ethanol at the OMCs depots would be around Rs 49 per litre.
According to Narendra Murkumbi, MD, Shree Renuka Sugars, this will lead to additional demand for 1.25 million litres of ethanol.
In an interview to ET Now, he said the ethanol price has been de-linked from price of petrol for the first time and has been linked to cane pricing.
New pricing will make it easier for mills to convert sugar to ethanol and the industry will have flexibility to move between sugar & ethanol production.
He expects new tender to be launched immediately.
The Cabinet Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) today fixed the delivered price of Ethanol in the range of Rs 48.50 per litre to Rs 49.50 per litre, depending upon the distance of sugar mill from the depot/installation of the public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs), an official statement said.
At 10:00 a.m.; Bajaj Hindusthan was at Rs 22.40, up 6.67 per cent, on the BSE. It surged 11.42 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 23.40.

NEW DELHI: Shares of SpiceJet continued their downward trend, slipping over 7 per cent in intraday trade on Thursday.
The fall comes despite the low-cost carrier getting some relief on Wednesday with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) giving it another five days to pay dues amounting to about Rs 200 crore.
SpiceJet shares have fallen 24% since December 1 when the payment trouble at the company erupted.
Today, the airline is offering cut-price fares on some sectors; in some instances almost half of what is charged by rivals. This falied to revive sentiment on the Street.
Also, the company seems to have failed to benefit from falling crude prices that is a huge factor in improving profit margins.
Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala picked 75 lakh shares of SpiceJet for more than Rs 13 crore through open market route in November end; though he tacitly said that he was not bullish on the stock.

UNGA to declare June 21 as World Yoga DayUNGA to declare June 21 as World Yoga Day

United Nations, December 11, 2014
First Published: 12:12 IST(11/12/2014)

The UN General Assembly will take up an India-led resolution on Thursday to declare June 21 every year as 'International Day of Yoga', with an unprecedented 175 countries joining as co-sponsors, less than three months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed the idea.
The draft resolution would recognise that "yoga provides a holistic approach to health and well-being," echoing Modi's remarks to the annual General Assembly session in September.
Besides proclaiming June 21 as the international Yoga day, the resolution would recognise that wider dissemination of information about the benefits of practising yoga would be beneficial for the health of the world population and invite all member and observer States, organizations of the UN system and other international and regional bodies to observe it in order to raise awareness of the benefits of practising yoga.
The resolution was prepared by India and informal consultations were convened in October by the Indian mission in the UN General Assembly where views on the topic were expressed by other delegations.
Garnering overwhelming support, 175 countries in the 193-member General Assembly have joined as co-sponsors as on December 9th, the highest number of co-sponsors ever for any UNGA resolution.
It is also for the first time that such an initiative has been proposed and implemented by any country in the UN General Assembly in less than 90 days.
In suggesting the June 21 date, Modi had indicated that the day has special significance in many parts of the world, being the longest day in the northern hemisphere.
The resolution would be adopted under 'Global Health and Foreign Policy.'
The initial official document circulated to the General Assembly, known as the L document, had 130 member states joining as co-sponsors, again the highest ever number of co-sponsors for such a document.
Significantly, overwhelming support for the Modi's initiative has been reflected in the various key nations that have come on board to co-sponsor the resolution including the five permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia, the UK and the United States.
Several Asian, European and Latin American countries and nearly 60% of African nations are also co-sponsorers including Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Egypt, Germany, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Myanmar, Nepal, South Korea, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Syria, Thailand and the UAE.
The president of the UN General Assembly Sam Kutesa and UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon are also expected to issue congratulatory statements once the resolution is introduced by India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asoke Kumar Mukerji and adopted.
Yoga is the 5,000-year-old Indian physical, mental and spiritual practice that aim to transform body and mind.

Dubai-based flydubai has announced addition of three new routes — Chennai, Hargeisa and Nejran — from the first quarter of 2015. Chennai, which is flydubai’s eighth destination in India, will be served with three flights a week from March, bringing the total number of weekly flights operated by it to 29.

Hamad Obaidalla, chief commercial officer at flydubai, said the airline had announced 26 new routes since January and took delivery of eight new aircraft to support its growth plans.
“We are very excited about the untapped opportunities in the emerging African markets, the progress the UAE has made on the bilateral front in India and the ongoing strong ties with Saudi,” he said.
The carrier has linked Dubai to 56 underserved destinations since it started its operations in 2009.

Shriram plans to dilute 23% stake in life  non-life insurance to SanlamShriram plans to dilute 23% stake in life, non-life insurance to Sanlam
T E Narasimhan | Chennai Dec 11, 2014 01:12 PM IST
As the Cabinet clears Insurance Bill, that is to hike composite Foreign Equity Cap to 49%, the Rs 60,000 crore Shriram Group's Life and General Insurance companies are gearing up to dilute 23% stake each to the South African financial group Sanlam.
In life insurance alone the stake is valued at around Rs 500 crore.
Shriram's life and non-life insurance ventures were originally floated along with Sanlam, but later Sanlam's holding was transferred to Shriram Capital as part of restructuring, in which the South African Conglomerate picked up 26% stake for Rs 1,600 crore.
Shriram Capital is the holding company of Shriram's Group's Rs 60,000 crore finance businesses including two NBFCs, insurance ventures, chit funds and others.
Now with the Cabinet's nod for foreign investors to pick up 49% stake, Sanlam is all set to acquire stake directly in both the companies. Once the stake is acquired, Sanlam will hold 23% directly and another 26% indirectly, through Shriram Capital, in both life and non-life companies of Shriram.
Industry sources said current valuation of Shriram Life is around Rs 2,000 crore and Sanlam is expected to infuse around Rs 500 crore for the 23% stake in the life insurance venture.
Manoj Kumar Jain, CEO and Wholetime Director, Shriram Life Insurance has confirmed the development, however he declined to comment on the valuations.
"As per our original agreement with Sanlam, when the Government allows foreign partners to increase stake, Sanlam will increase immediately," said Jain, who welcomed Government's decision stating that this will drive the sentiment and lots of liquidity will be new insurance companies to expand the business, for which they are scouting for capital. "This will be an oxygen for them."
In response to Business Standard's query, Sanlam said it’s shareholding in the Shriram insurance businesses is currently held indirectly via its effective shareholding in Shriram Capital Limited.
"If Regulations are changed to increase the limit placed on foreign ownership of insurance companies, SEM will consider increasing its effective stake in the Shriram insurance businesses. This may be achieved through a combination of an increased stake in Shriram Capital Limited and/or direct stakes in the Shriram insurance businesses," said Sanlam in an email response.
On the benefits for Shriram, he said, "the company is not in need of capital, the stake dilution is to meet our obligation and what we have committed to Sanlam," Jain.
He noted, Shriram Life's solvency ratio is at around 6.1% as compared to 1.5%, according to the norm.
Shriram Life in 2013-14 clocked GWP of Rs 590 crore and reported a profit of Rs 86 crore. The company is looking at 20% growth during the current fiscal as far as GWP concerned. To support the target, the company is targeting to increase its branches by 10% every year. At present the company has 414 branches across the country.

Is rider safety the real Achilles heel for UberRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
The growth of ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft so far has not been hindered by limits from government regulators and campaigns by taxi cab competitors. A bigger threat to the new industry’s impressive start could come from customers – if enough people stop using the services over fears that drivers aren’t safe.
Not safe as in the drivers won’t get into an accident – safe as in they won’t attack passengers.
Uber operates in more than 250 cities in 50 countries, and recently was valued at $40 billion based on $1.2 billion that investors poured into the company in its latest funding round. Lyft, meanwhile, operates in 70 markets in the U.S., up from 30 at the start of the year.
So far, controversies have not seemed impact the popularity of ride-hailing apps. They boast several advantages over taxis, including no-cash payments and an app that shows how far away a car is and whether the driver received positive reviews from prior riders. Uber ranks 39th in the Apple iTunes store among the most popular free apps, ahead of Gmail and the music streaming service Pandora. Lyft, which is much smaller, is not in the top 100.
But just this week, California prosecutors sued both, saying they misrepresent and exaggerate the rigor of their background checks. Police in India questioned an Uber executive about its background checks after a driver was accused of raping a passenger. And Uber removed a driver in Chicago after a customer reported she was sexually assaulted during a ride in the city last month. The company said it is cooperating with police in what it called “an appalling and unacceptable incident.
This week’s incidents follow scattered anecdotes of previous assaults by Uber drivers. They don’t prove the services are unsafe alternatives to traditional taxis. But they do present a challenge if riders begin to think they reflect a systemic disregard for passenger safety.
Jeff Brewer, pastor at a church in the Chicago suburbs, wouldn’t step into an Uber car. Though he likes the convenience Uber would bring, he sticks with taxis on trips into the city.
“Whether it’s right or wrong, there’s at least some sort of perception that there’s a company that has vetted the person,” he said.
As with airlines, if passenger safety becomes an ongoing issue with Uber rather than isolated incidents, it could face long-term consequences, said Alex Stanton, a crisis management and communications specialist.
“At some level, there is a point at which safety does trump convenience,” Stanton said.
“On its website, Uber says its drivers are “screened through a rigorous process we’ve developed using constantly improving standards.” In a written statement, Uber added that it screens would-be drivers against “federal, multi-state and county criminal background checks spanning the past seven years.” The company expects to complete more than 2 million checks this year, according to spokesman Lane Kasselman.
But California prosecutors, who filed lawsuits against Uber in San Francisco Superior Court, say the company’s safety checks are not as rigorous as they sound. Unlike with regulated taxis in San Francisco and Los Angeles, Uber’s background checks do not require drivers be fingerprinted.
Hirease, the company that performs Uber’s background checks, instead relies on “personal identifiers,” such as license numbers and Social Security numbers are supplied by the applicants. As such, the lawsuit says, there is no way to ensure that the applicants are who they say they are.
As part of a settlement of a similar lawsuit, Uber rival Lyft agreed to drop claims that its background checks are the “best available” and the “gold standard.”
Cab drivers have seized on the safety issue, saying that taxi drivers have to pass government-standard checks which cost more but do a better job screening out bad applicants. The Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association has launched a “Who’s Driving You?” campaign targeting Uber and Lyft.
“Once consumers realize Uber and Lyft are cutting costs, they’ll begin to shy away,” said Dave Sutton, an association spokesman.

Badaun Case: CBI files closure report  questions actions of girlsrelativesBy: Press Trust of India | Badaun |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:14 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 2:23 pm
CBI on Thursday filed a closure report in the death of two teenage cousins in Badaun in western Uttar Pradesh, ruling out murder and rape and concluding that it was a case of suicide.
The agency filed its report before Special Judge Anil Kumar in Badaun saying there was no forensic or circumstantial evidence suggesting rape and murder as alleged in the FIR registered by the Uttar Pradesh Police after the bodies of the two girls were found hanging from a tree in May this year.
The matter has been listed for January 6, 2015, according to Additional District Government Counsel Rajiv Kumar. The agency said the two girls had committed suicide fearing retribution as the affair of the elder girl with a local boy from different caste had come light.
The final report mentions questionable actions of the fathers of the girls, an uncle and main witness Nazru, also a distant relative, leaving it to the court to take further action, sources said.
The bodies of the two cousins, both around 14 years of age, were found hanging in an orchard on May 28. The girls’ families had alleged that they were kidnapped and murdered by five youths from the village.
The incident sparked an outcry in the country and abroad with questions being raised over the law and order situation. Even United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon had expressed concern.
CBI said that there was no evidence of rape or murder as there was no sign of struggle on their clothes and bodies. The agency said forensic analysis also revealed that there was no male DNA or sperm on their bodies.
The agency closed the investigations with dropping of charges against five accused – Pappu, Awadhesh and Urvesh Yadav (brothers) and constables Chhatrapal Yadav and Sarvesh Yadav – named as prime accused by the state police for the alleged rape and murder of the girls. They said a recommendation for probe against state police officers for botched up investigation will be made.
The sources said the case will also be an example of how the system of post-mortem can be improved to help investigators arrive at correct conclusions.
The theory of rape and murder fell flat in view of the findings in forensic reports received from three-member medical board, Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, FSL, Gandhinagar among others.
“Based on around 40 scientific reports, CBI has concluded that the two minor girls in the Badaun case had not been raped and murdered as had been alleged in the FIR. Investigation continued…

World Wide Web inventor says Internet should be humanrightBy: Associated Press | London |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:11 pm
The computer scientist credited with inventing the World Wide Web says affordable access to the Internet should be recognized as a human right, as a report showed that billions of people still cannot go online and government surveillance and censorship are increasing.
Tim Berners-Lee said Thursday the Internet can help tackle inequality — but only if it comes with the rights to privacy and freedom of expression. The Briton, who launched the Web in 1990, made the remarks as he released his World Wide Web Foundation’s latest report tracking the Internet’s global impact.
The Web Index found that laws preventing mass online surveillance are weak or nonexistent in more than 84 per cent of countries. It also said that almost 40 percent of surveyed countries were blocking sensitive online content to a “moderate or extreme degree,” and that half of all Web users live in countries that severely restrict their rights online.
Almost 4.4 billion people — most of them in developing countries — still have no access to the Internet, the Web Index said.
“It’s time to recognize the Internet as a basic human right,” Berners-Lee said. “That means guaranteeing affordable access for all, ensuring Internet packets are delivered without commercial or political discrimination, and protecting the privacy and freedom of Web users regardless of where they live.”
Denmark, Finland, and Norway were ranked as top overall, meaning they were best at using the Internet for economic, political and social progress. At the bottom of a list of 86 countries were Yemen, Myanmar and Ethiopia.
Berners-Lee was working an engineer at the CERN laboratory in Geneva when he proposed the idea of a World Wide Web in 1989.

Agra  conversions  row hits Parliament  Oppn demands discussionComments
The government offered to bring a law on religious conversion amid opposition pressure in Parliament on Thursday over the Agra controversy and tension in Aligarh and other sensitive areas where hard-line Hindu groups were aggressively pushing ahead their “reconversion” programmes.

“The government is ready to discuss and build a consensus on having a legislation on (religious) conversion,” parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said in the Lok Sabha after Opposition MPs shouted slogans demanding a debate and an adjournment motion on the Agra incident in which 57 poor Muslim families were apparently tricked to switch to Hinduism at a camp hosted by the Dharam Jagaran Samiti and the Bajrang Dal.
The Opposition also demanded an adjournment motion, saying incidents like the one in Agra could ignite riots. “They (organisers of religious conversions) are bringing the country a bad name and sowing seeds of poison,” said Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge.
When Parliament was debating the situation arising out of the Agra incident, an explosive letter surfaced in Agra in which Dharam Jagran Samiti leader Rajeshwer Singh has outlined the target, expenditure and achievement of his organisation to its cadre.
Setting a goal of 50 events this year to convert 100,000 Muslims and Christians, the letter seeks donations to go ahead with its proposed programmes, called ghar wapsi or homecoming ceremonies.
It calls for help from each volunteer to at least fund one event, saying Rs. 5 lakh is required to “reconvert” a Muslim while expenses on problems related to a Christian come to Rs. 2 lakh.
The letter says such ceremonies have “brought back” to Hinduism 40,000 people, including 2,000 Muslims, in 20 districts.
In communally-sensitive Aligarh, the Dharam Jagaran Samiti and the VHP announced their plan to “reconvert” 5,000 Christians and 1,000 Muslims at a function on Christmas.
They said Hindus would be appealed to welcome the “reconverted” Muslims and Christians, who had apparently switched faith from Hinduism some time in history.
Firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, who is the MP for Gorakhpur, and other senior leaders of RSS and VHP offshoots are likely to attend the programme to be held on a college campus.
The Hindu Yuva Vahini that Adityanath had floated, too, has a plan to convert over 2,000 people at a similar programme at Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh on December 18.
Muslim groups and political parties not aligned with the BJP demanded the governments at the Centre and the state to restrain the radical Hindu outfits .
Security in Aligarh was strengthened to prevent any violence. Senior superintendent of police J Ravindra Gaud promised swift action on any complaint of forced conversion.

Putin visit: Russia agrees with India to build 12 nuclear reactorsPutin backs Make In India with copter, nuclear deals
Jayanth Jacob , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 11, 2014

Russia offered to help India set up at least 10 more nuclear reactors and manufacture light-utility helicopters  in line with the Make in India campaign as the two countries stepped up their defence and strategic partnership during President Vladimir Putin’s visit on Thursday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Russia would remain India’s most important defence partner and its “unique place in India’s foreign policy will not change” as he laid out a roadmap for stronger energy and business ties between New Delhi and Moscow at their 15th annual summit.
As India and Russia sought to strengthen a once-close relationship, the two countries signed 20 agreements including a contract to implement the third and fourth reactors of the Kudankulam nuclear power plant and a joint investment fund of $1 billion for Indian infrastructure and hydroelectric projects. Other strategic deals covered oil supply, infrastructure and an increase in direct diamond sales to India by Russian firm Alrosa.
Both nations team up to help Afghanistan, eradicate terrorism
“Even as India’s options have increased today, Russia will remain our most important defence partner,” Modi said after the summit. “Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters. It includes the possibility of exports from India. We will follow up on this quickly.”
HT was the first to report that Russia would join Modi’s first big-ticket ‘Make in India’ initiative in the defence sector.
The agreements reflected Russia’s need for allies in the face of Western sanctions over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Though India’s defence cooperation with other countries is expanding, 60% of defence purchases still come from Russia. However, India plans to bring down its dependence on foreign vendors and increase indigenisation of the defence sector as part of the Modi government’s Make in India initiative.
For the chopper deal, public sector unit Hindustan Aeronautics Limited or an Indian private firm could partner for the production of Kamov 226 T helicopters in India as bidding for these reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters is restricted for Indian firms and their joint ventures.
In the first phase, the order could be for 384 helicopters, which could subsequently be increased to 600 to replace the ailing Cheetah/Chetak fleet used by the Indian Army and air force.
The total cost of the project is expected to be over $3 billion.
Modi has also proposed that Russia should manufacture spares and components of Russian defence equipment, a request Putin responded to positively.
Like the defence sector, Russia also aligned nuclear cooperation with Make in India as the two leaders unveiled an ambitious nuclear energy plan to build at least 10 reactors. “It will also include manufacture of equipment and components in India. This also supports our Make in India policy,” Modi said. “Our partnership and the strong sensitivity that we have always had for each other’s interests will be a source of strength to both countries,” the Prime Minister said.
Putin said Russia could eventually supply India with 20 nuclear reactors.
“We highly appreciate the friendship, trust and mutual understanding with Indian partners,” said Putin.

Sri Lankan stocks edge down on political uncertaintySri Lankan stocks edge down on political uncertainty
Reuters
Tweet
Colombo, Dec 11:  
Sri Lankan stocks eased slightly in thin trade on Thursday as cautious investors kept to the sidelines amid political uncertainty ahead of the January 8 presidential poll.
At 0645 GMT, the main stock index was down 0.04 per cent at 7,251.16. Turnover was SLR 351.5 million ($2.68 million), with 14.5 million shares changing hands.
“The turnover is low because investors are just watchful ahead of the election. Investors want to see stability and consistency,’’ a stockbroker said on condition on anonymity.
Nineteen candidates, including President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Health Minister Mithripala Sirisena, the consensus candidate of a united Opposition, had on Monday submitted their nominations for the polls.
So far, 11 loyalists from Rajapaksa’s United People’s Freedom Alliance, including Sirisena, have defected after he announced snap elections last month, while two Opposition legislators have joined the ruling party.
Speculation over more defections also weighed on the sentiment, analysts said.
Rajapaksa’s third-term re-election, which was seen easy earlier, has suddenly become a challenge after Sirisena announced his candidature supported by all Opposition parties.
Both the main candidates are yet to announce their policies.
Rupee forwards
Four-day rupee forwards traded steady as mild importer dollar demand offset greenback sales by exporters, dealers said.
The four-day forwards traded at 131.97/132.00 per dollar at 0704 GMT, compared with Wednesday’s close of 131.95/132.00.
The spot currency and three-day forwards, or spot-next, were not traded after the central bank capped the currency at predetermined levels to prevent volatility. The four-day rupee also was capped at 132.00, dealers said.
Central bank officials were not available for comment.

Patent row: Delhi HC bans Xiaomi phone sales in IndiaEricsson says Xiaomi has been violating its eight patents pertaining to AMR, EDGE and 3G technologies in the field of telecommunication.
New Delhi, Dec 11:  
The Delhi High Court in an interim order on Wednesday restrained Xiaomi as well as online e-commerce site Flipkart from selling in India handsets of the Chinese mobile maker that run on the technology patented by Ericsson.
The court has also restrained Xiaomi or its agents from making, assembling, importing or offering for sale its devices which are infringing the mobile phone technology patented by Ericsson.
Justice GP Mittal directed the customs authorities to prevent import of Xiaomi phones that are infringing the patents of Ericsson and if any consignment is imported, the same be informed to Ericsson and its objections be decided as per the Intellectual Property Rules.
“I am satisfied that plaintiff (Ericsson) has made out a prima facie case for grant of ad interim injunction in its favour. The balance of convenience also lies in favour of plaintiff and in the absence of an injunction order, plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and injury,” the court said.
It also issued summons and notice to Xiaomi and Flipkart and directed them to file an affidavit disclosing the number of devices — that are AMR, EDGE and 3G compliant — sold by them in India till date.
They have to also indicate in the affidavit the revenue earned by selling these devices till date.
The court has also appointed three local commissioners to visit the premises of Xiaomi and Flipkart where the devices are stored in order to inspect and collect documents as well as seal the infringing mobiles.
The total fees of the local commissioners, amounting to Rs 3.5 lakh shall be borne by Ericsson apart from travel and stay expenses, it said.
The local commissioners have to submit their report within four weeks, it also said.
The order was passed on the plea of Ericsson that Xiaomi has been violating its eight patents pertaining to AMR, EDGE and 3G technologies in the field of telecommunication.
Ericsson has said that it had invited Xiaomi to use its patented technology by obtaining a licence, but instead of doing so, the Chinese manufacturer launched its devices in India in July 2014.

From the President s penFrom the President's pen: What Rashtrapati Bhavan occupants have written through the decades
Nivedita Mookerji | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 01:54 PM IST
Publicly available information shows at least 11 of the 12 Presidents before Mukherjee have authored books. Mukherjee himself had written four books before becoming President, between 1984 and 1992.
Starting from the first President Dr Rajendra Prasad to the 11th, A P J Abdul Kalam, all expressed their thoughts on a wide range of topics and issues — from the masterly spiritual and philosophical collection of Dr S Radhakrishnan to delicately handled stories for children by President Zakir Hussain.
While President K R Narayanan demonstrated his brilliance as a former journalist in his book Nehru and his Vision, scholarly and scientific bent of mind was in evidence in Kalam’s Wings of Fire and Ignited Minds.
On the political spectrum, Mukherjee has in his latest book tried to recreate what the fifth President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed mentioned in the Speeches of Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, narrating the events leading up to the Emergency and after.

Oman India Fund invests in GSP Crop ScienceOman India Fund invests in GSP Crop Science
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 08:39 PM IST
The Oman India Joint Investment Fund (OIJIF), a joint venture between SBI and State General Reserve Fund (SGRF) has invested Rs 95 crore in GSP Crop Science, a Gujarat-based agrochemical company.

“We believe there is a huge potential for growth in the agrochemical sector in India driven by growing awareness among farmers and favorable pol- itical impetus. With OIJIF’s investment and our internal resources, GSP aims to double its market share in coming three years,” Kenal Shah, MD of GSP Crop Science Pvt Ltd said.

Rupee falls to over 9-mth low on decline in domestic sharesForex update: Rupee plunges 31 paise to 10-month low of 62.33 against dollar
Neha Dasgupta     Mumbai   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 19:59 IST

The rupee on Thursday plunged 31 paise to a ten-month low of 62.33 versus the Greenback on strong demand for the US dollar due to oil firms stepping up purchases of crude oil trading near 5-year lows and a weak trend in shares.
Concerns related to capital outflows and a strong dollar in overseas markets against other currencies like the Japanese Yen too weighed on the rupee, a forex dealer said.
Logging its fourth consecutive session of decline, the domestic unit has now shed 56 paise against the US dollar.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the rupee resumed lower at 62.15 a dollar from its Wednesday's close of 62.02 and immediately the intra-day high of 62.12.
However, weakness in the domestic equity market throughout the day put pressure on the domestic currency.
The rupee gradually declined to a low of 62.3575 before ending at 62.33, logging a fall of 31 paise.
This is the currency's weakest close since February, 2014.
In terms of single-session fall, Thursday's 31-paise slide is its biggest drop against the US dollar since October 16, when it had slumped by 42 paise.
The American unit got a lift against the rupee as unwinding of the Yen and Euro carry trades triggered a sell-off in local equities.
"The sell-off global equity market has spilled over into Indian shores as well. As a result, we have seen buying of US Dollars... Over the past two sessions. There was demand noted from a few PSUs," said Anindya Banerjee, Currency Analyst, Kotak Securities.
Meanwhile, the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex on Thursday , after taking a respite for a day, tumbled by 229.09 points (or 0.82 per cent).
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out US $6.92 million on Wednesday, as per data released by market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
The dollar index was up by 0.06 per cent against its six major global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said, "Indian Rupee depreciated by half per cent, taking cues from dollar index which is trading multi-year highs. Also, the dollar demand from oil companies dented the rupee movement further. There is caution ahead of consumer price inflation data due tomorrow (Friday)."
The trading range for the spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 62.00 to 62.70, Brahmbhatt added.

Watch the interview of Manas Jaiswal, manasjaiswal.com with Ekta Batra & Reema Tendulkar on CNBC-TV18, in which he shared his readings and outlook on market and specific stocks.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Manas Jaiswal's interview with CNBC-TV18.
From the level of Rs 365, UPL  is making lower tops and lower bottoms. Now it has
broken the neckline of head and shoulder pattern which is a bearish sign. So, the stock can test its 200 day moving average (DMA) which is placed at around Rs 300. So, that is our target and stoploss should be Rs 330.
Most of the metal stocks are looking weak on the charts. Few days back, Tata Steel  fell below 200 day moving average (DMA). Today it has broken an important support of Rs 435. This south bound journey will continue in the coming days also. The stock can test Rs 400, so even at current level, one can short with a stoploss of Rs 436.

Bengaluru, Dec 11:  
In the wake of Centre’s advisory to states to ensure stoppage of web-based taxi services following the alleged rape of a 27-year-old woman executive in Delhi, the Karnataka Government today said all taxi services that are not registered in the State will be considered illegal and will have to stop operations immediately.
“All those taxi services who have not registered in the State will be considered illegal and will be stopped from operating. Those who have registered will be legal and can operate as usual,” Transport Commissioner Rame Gowda told PTI.
The Centre on Tuesday had asked all States and Union Territories to ensure stoppage of web-based taxi services, including Uber.
“The Ministry of Home Affairs has advised the state governments/UT administrations to ensure that the operations of the web-based taxi services are stopped,” Home Minister Rajnath Singh had said in a suo motu statement in Rajya Sabha.
Asked if any time would be given to taxi services to register, Gowda said “no, they can’t operate. With immediate effect they will have to stop.”
On Uber, he said ”...they have also not registered, so illegal terms will apply to them as well.”
Following the rape of the woman executive in Delhi by a taxi driver, City Police had on Tuesday issued instructions that all drivers must get their background verification done before December 31.
Instructing taxi drivers and owners that all the 25 permit conditions must be strictly followed, police had said “if the permit conditions are violated by a taxi, the operator or the aggregator, whoever it may be, will be jointly liable for criminal action.”

Middle class diamond purchases up four-fold in12 years in India: De BeersMiddle class diamond purchases up four-fold in 12 years in India: De Beers
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 10:32 PM IST
The acquisition rate of diamonds in India’s middle class has risen fourfold in the last 12 years, which indicates the country quickly developing a diamond consumer market to complement its pre-eminence as a leading policy centre, a leading diamond miner said.
Speaking at the World Diamond Conference, Stephen Lussier, executive vice-president of marketing for The De Beers Group of Companies, said, “The acquisition rate for diamonds in India’s middle class has risen sharply from two per cent in 2002 to nine per cent in 2014. The favourable environment for further diamond consumption growth in India’s number of middle class households is forecast to grow by a compound annual rate of 12 per cent over the next decade.” This was the finding of De Beers’ recent consumer diamond purchasing survey in India, he added.
Currently, India imports approximately 90 per cent of its rough diamond requirement from trading centres such as the European Union, Israel and United Arab Emirates; and only 10 per cent of its rough purchase comes directly from producing countries such as Russia, Australia, Canada and Africa. However, Lussier, who is also CEO of De Beers’ jewellery brand Forevermark, cautioned that increased competition from other luxury products means the  industry must capitalise on opportunities in areas such as online marketing and branding is to maximise its potential.
Underlining De Beers’ commitment to India, the company has invested nearly $10 million in a state-of-the-art inscription and grading operation in Surat, which has the initial capacity to inscribe 400,000 diamonds – dramatically improving the service for its Indian-based Forevermark partners. Rio Tinto Diamonds managing director Jean-Marc Lieberherr said “Our partnership with the Indian diamond industry is a 30-year journey that covers everything from diamond manufacturing technology to unique market development initiatives and the first diamond discovery in India in decades.
Rio Tinto has underscored the importance of its strategic partnership in India in driving growth and future opportunities in the global industry. Rio Tinto is currently developing the Bunder diamond project in Madhya Pradesh, which is set to put India among the top 10 diamond producer countries in the world.
“The Bunder project is positive proof of the natural abundance and prospectivity of India and provides the ideal opportunity to showcase a new benchmark for mine development in India. The opportunity to produce diamonds mined, manufactured and marketed in India on a commercial scale is exciting and very much aligned to the ‘Make in India’ campaign.”
The Bunder project, discovered in 2004 and currently awaiting approvals, will generate an estimated 30,000 jobs and huge economic benefits for India.
Lieberherr said Rio Tinto’s Argyle Diamonds mine in Australia would be delivering increased volumes from 2015, which would have a direct impact on the Indian manufacturing sector.
Further downstream Rio Tinto Diamonds is continuing its focus on the retail sector with its flagship Indian marketing initiative, “Nazraana” which promotes affordable diamond jewellery as gifts for all occasions.
The conference was organised by the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council in association with the World Diamond Mark Foundation and attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
India is set to ink a pact with the world’s leading Russian diamond miner Alrosa for direct supply of rough diamonds to India.

NEW DELHI: The Uber taxi driver accused of raping a 27-year-old working woman on Friday night has an extremely murky past.
Shiv Kumar Yadav was booked in several other cases in the last eight years and has a disturbing pattern of assaulting women.
The 32-year-old driver has been slapped with a sexual assault case, two molestation cases and an Arms Act case between 2006 and 2013, reports CNN-IBN.
In 2011, he was imprisoned for seven months for raping a 22-year-old employee of a Gurgaon pub in 2011 and was out on bail.
He was booked in 2013 in Uttar Pradesh's Mainpuri for a sexual assault case.
Two molestation cases were registered against him in 2009 and he had also been held under the Arms Act in 2006.
On Sunday, he was arrested from his hideout in Uttar Pradesh's Mathura town for raping a 27-year-old working woman in Delhi.
The driver has been accused of raping the woman who was returning home in north Delhi's Inderlok area from Gurgaon, where she is employed as an analyst in a finance company in Sector 21 for the past three years.
Rape accused taxi driver threatened victim with iron rod
The driver accused in the Uber rape case revealed to the police that he too had threatened the victim with an iron rod.
According to a report in The Times of India, the woman was partying with her friends at a pub in Gurgaon and, around 9.00 pm, left for a friend's place in Vasant Vihar. It was from here she booked a cab for home.
On her way, the victim dozed off in the cab and suddenly woke up to find the driver on the rear seat, attempting to molest her.
The report quotes from her statement: 'I tried to push him away and looked around only to find the car at a desolate spot. He slapped me a few times and scratched me on the face and neck during the scuffle. When I tried to scream, he pressed my mouth and threatened to kill me. He said, 'sariya ghusa doonga pet mein agar chillayi toh' (I will thrust an iron rod into your stomach if you scream). I pleaded with him not to harm me.'
The report further adds that, after raping her, the driver took away her phone but returned it with the warning that the victim should keep mum about the incident.
The victim managed to note down the driver's number and take a photograph of his car. (Agencies)

Retail Inflation Likely Fell to Record Low in November: PollArun Jaitley Resolves to Encourage Public, Private Investment in 2015
Bengaluru: Indian consumer inflation probably fell to a record low in November, dragged down by falling food and fuel prices, while growth in core industries nudged factory output up in October, a Reuters poll showed.
The latest survey of 36 economists forecast that retail inflation cooled to an annual rate of 4.50 percent from October's 5.52 per cent.
That would make it the lowest since the government started releasing the data in 2012. Official retail inflation data will be released on Friday.
Wholesale price inflation was forecast to slow to 1.41 per cent in November from 1.77 per cent in October, making a new five-year low. The data will be released on December 15.
"Continued steep declines in food and fuel prices, as well as subdued core pressures, mean that consumer price inflation is likely to have dropped to a record low in November," wrote Shilan Shah, Capital Economics' India economist, in a note.
While expecting some acceleration in inflation during coming months, partly due to the unwinding of a favourable base effect, the Reserve Bank of India raised hopes at a policy review last week that it would cut interest rates once it becomes more sure that inflationary pressures are waning.
The Reuters poll also forecast that production at India's factories, mines and utilities rose an annual 2.80 per cent in October compared to 2.50 per cent in September.
Data last week showed annual infrastructure output, which accounts for more than a third of overall factory production, accelerated to a four-month high of 6.3 per cent in October.
The uptrend in industrial production will probably continue, according to a private survey earlier this month which showed strong demand meant factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in nearly two years in November.
The positive data suggests the economy may be gaining momentum after losing some steam in the July-September quarter.
"A recovery is certainly underway. Its sustainability depends critically on the continued efforts by the government to resolve the issues surrounding stalled projects," said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.

Centre to Release Rs 11 000 Crore CST Compensation to States: JaitleyYou are here: Home Economy
Government to Release Rs 11,000 Crore CST Compensation to States
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 10, 2014 23:40 (IST)
Arun Jaitley Resolves to Encourage Public, Private Investment in 2015
New Delhi: A day ahead of his meeting with state finance ministers, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Wednesday that the government will soon release Rs 11,000 crore towards Central Sales Tax (CST) compensation, as part of consensus building for Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout.
"...despite difficult and challenging situation, I propose to release about Rs 11,000 crore, which is one-third, this year as a part payment as a CST compensation to the states," he said replying to a debate on Supplementary Demand for Grants in the Lok Sabha.
CST compensation is one sticky issue that has been holding up agreement on introduction of the GST regime to replace all indirect taxes.
"The balance amount I will start paying from the next financial year onwards and hopefully...and therefore I am making this commitment to this house today...and if necessary, the financial year is up to 31st of March, I hope my revenue position is in a position to afford this kind of an expenditure," he added.
Mr Jaitley has called a meeting of all state finance ministers on Thursday to iron out contentious issues as he looks to introduce a constitutional amendment Bill in the current session of Parliament.
"I have tomorrow (Thursday) called all the finance ministers of the state and GST is an issue on which broadly most parties have agreed. Let me put the statement: a major impediment in the implementation of the GST has been the trust deficit between the states and the Centre," he said.
"One of the major reasons for this trust deficit is non-payment of the CST compensation to the states from the year 2010 onwards."
Clearance of CST compensation arrears has been a bone of contention between the Centre and states, as the states still wait for Rs 13,000 crore arrears pending till 2010.
As regards the compensation structure, the states have sought a five-year compensation mechanism from the Centre and demanded the same be included in the Constitutional Amendment Bill.
CST, a tax imposed on the inter-state movement of goods, was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in 2007-08 and further to 2 per cent in 2008-09 after the introduction of value added tax (VAT). The Centre had then promised the states that it would bear losses due to reduction of CST.
As part of the roll-out of GST, the CST is being phased out and has been reduced to two per cent from the earlier 4 per cent. The Centre collects CST and distributes it among states.
GST is being targeted to be implemented by April 2016. The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT and local levies on the states front.
"In my meeting with the empowered committee with state finance ministers on July 3, 2014, I had committed that the partial payment of the outstanding CST compensation will be released this year," Mr Jaitley added.
"GST is not an issue on which we are divided on partisan line. Most state governments are going to benefit. The revenues are going to improve as far as the Centre is concerned, states are concerned and I wish to just assure this house with this commitment," the Finance Minister said.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
States have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco be kept out of the purview of the GST.
The GST roll out has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the proposed new tax regime.

Uber cab rape case: Apac head questioned againRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
The Asia-Pacific head of US-based cab service Uber was questioned by the police for the second consecutive day yesterday in connection with the rape of a 27-year-old finance executive by the company’s driver, during which he was asked about details of their safety features, details of drivers among others.
During questioning, which took place for nearly two hours, Eric Alexander, the Uber Asia-Pacific head was handed over a 12 point questionnaire by police which included details of all the taxis and its drivers working with them and how they checked their antecedents and the details of the directors of the company, its security features and background check mechanism.
Delhi court sends Uber cab driver, accused of raping a 27-year-old woman, in judicial custody till December 24.
— Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) December 11, 2014
“Alexander has asked for a week’s time to submit the answers of the questions as some of them had to be sourced from their headquarters in San Francisco,” said DCP (North) Madhur Verma.
The police which had registered an FIR against the company is yet to decide on who faces the liability for the negligence on part of Uber.
The Hong Kong-based executive was also asked whether they had received any prior complaints about Shiv Kumar Yadav, the accused in this case, route of the cab and of the accused on the day of the incident, number of drops Yadav did during his period with the company and the feedback about him from customers.
Alexander had reached the DCP office at Civil Lines in the evening along with the General Manager (Marketing) Gagan Bhatia in the evening.
He was also asked about the India operations of the company and its organizational structure.
Police officials also suggested that an emergency button should be present in the car in case of any emergency.
My deepest sympathies with the victim. We are cooperating with the police and I cannot divulge further details since investigations are underway, Alexander told reporters after the questioning.
He had joined the investigation on Tuesday and had met senior police officials of north district at Civil Lines.
He was issued a notice by police under section 91 CrPC to provide certain documents of the company.
He had also  visited the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) office on Tuesday after being summoned by it.
Delhi Police, which has already filed an FIR against Uber charging it with cheating its customers and defying government orders, has been questioning senior Uber officials for the last three days.
The company was banned from operating in the city by Delhi government on Monday.

Hong Kong police start clearing barricades; aim to retake occupied streetsA yellow banner reading "We'll be back" is displayed by protesters at the occupied area outside government headquarters in Hong Kong. (Source: AP Photo)
By: Reuters | Hong Kong |
Posted: December 11, 2014 9:47 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 3:29 pm
Hong Kong workers cleared large parts of the main pro-democracy protest site on Thursday as police hauled activists away one by one, marking an end to more than two months of street demonstrations that have choked parts of the Chinese-controlled city.
Groups of up to four police started taking protesters away from the Admiralty site, next to government buildings and the Central business area, after workers used wire cutters to remove barricades and dismantle bamboo scaffolding.
Martin Lee, one of the founders of the main opposition Democratic Party, student leader Nathan Law, media mogul Jimmy Lai and legislators were among those led away.
The mainly peaceful protests to demand free elections in the former British colony have represented one of the most serious challenges to China’s authority since the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations and bloody crackdown in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.
Hundreds of police swept through other parts of Admiralty, checking tents before dragging them away along with metal barriers, plastic sheets and umbrellas, which activists had used during clashes to guard against pepper spray and baton blows. A decapitated cardboard cutout of Chinese President Xi Jinping stood in front of a police line.
“The movement has been surreal. No one knew it could last more than two months … in a place where time and money are most important,” said protester Javis Luk, 27. There was little resistance as protesters packed up pillows, blankets and other belongings from inside their tents in some of the world’s most expensive real estate and prepared to leave.
Some protesters mocked police warnings, shouting their own aimed at Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Leung Chun-ying. “This is the last warning for CY Leung! Show your face, CY Leung,” they shouted. Key opposition pro-democracy lawmakers and Hong Kong media magnate Jimmy Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing, sat near the People’s Liberation Army base and adopted the three-finger salute used in the film “Hunger Games” against totalitarian rule.
Despite the clearance, the Occupy movement has been a social watershed, with people pushing back against increasing control and standing up to Beijing to preserve democracy and freedoms largely denied on the mainland. For many, it was a tearful farewell to the site where thousands had gathered in recent weeks and many have called home since late September.
“The movement has been an awakening process for Hong Kong. People who weren’t interested in politics before are now and aren’t afraid to get arrested, especially the young people,” said Labour Party lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan. The clearance at Admiralty comes more than two weeks after authorities removed barricades from a protest site in the working-class district of Mong Kok, sparking several nights of running battles between demonstrators and police.

Asian shares down as oil fall hits risk sentimentAsian shares down as oil fall hits risk sentiment, dollar struggles

Asian Stocks
(Tokyo's Nikkei lost 1 per…)
TOKYO: Asian stocks fell on Thursday as falling oil prices continued to feed into global growth concerns, while the dollar struggled against peers such as the yen and euro after a further drop in US bond yields.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 per cent as another large decline in oil prices took a heavy toll on energy shares and hit Wall Street hard overnight.
The volatile Shanghai Composite Index shed earlier gains and fell 0.3 per cent.
Crude oil prices fell as much as 5 per cent overnight after data underscored weak US demand and Saudi Arabia reiterated that it has no plans to curb output.
US crude posted a modest rebound on Thursday after the overnight tumble, gaining 0.8 per cent to $61.44 a barrel after falling to a 5-1/2 year low of $60.43 on Wednesday.
Tokyo's Nikkei lost 1 per cent, pulling further back from 7-1/2 year highs hit at the week's start, with sentiment bruised by the rout in US stocks.
The dollar edged up 0.2 per cent to 118.09 yen, getting some respite after retreating from a seven-year high of 121.86 reached on Monday.
The S&P 500, at a record high just last Friday, fell to its lowest since early November on Wednesday.
"Recent nervousness in equity market sentiment is consistent with our view that equity fund positioning is near peak levels, which points to a near-term pullback," strategists at Barclays said in a note to clients.
"With underperformance by active managers, we worry that redemptions will continue and force an unwind of currently extended positioning," they said.
In addition to declining oil, concerns over the political situation in Greece have also dented appetite for risk assets.
The euro gained 0.1 per cent to $1.2456, putting further distance between a 2-1/2 year trough of $1.2247 hit on Monday.
Still, the divergence in US monetary policy from Europe and Japan could continue to favour the greenback in the long term.
New Zealand's central bank governor said he expected to see the most quantitative easing since 2011 around the world next year, particularly as economic risks in Japan and Europe remain.
"There are question marks around Japan and certainly in Europe," Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler told a media briefing.
The RBNZ on Thursday held its benchmark rate at a near six-year high and signalled further modest rate rises over time. That propelled the New Zealand dollar to a nine-day high of $0.7872 and away from a 2-1/2 year low of $0.7609 plumbed Tuesday.
The Australian dollar rose 0.4 per cent to $0.8348 after data showed Australian employment in November showed a much higher than expected rise.
The Aussie, another recent beneficiary of the retreating greenback, had fallen to a 4-1/2 year low of $0.8223 on Tuesday.
Safe-haven government debt remained better-bid. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield touched 0.390 per cent, its lowest since April 2013.

FM promises  civilised  tax regime to attract investmentFM Arun Jaitley promises 'civilised' tax regime to attract investment
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 11:16 IST
FM Arun Jaitley
India will soon raise the foreign investment cap in insurance sector and work for making the tax regime "civilised" to attract overseas investments, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Wednesday while exuding confidence of achieving 6 per cent growth next fiscal.
Underlining that growth would depend on the states, he talked about cooperative federalism and announced release of Rs 11,000 crore to states in the current fiscal as part payment towards CST compensation to facilitate roll-out of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
Jaitley was replying to a debate in the Lok Sabha on Supplementary Demands for Grants for an additional expenditure of over Rs 12,500 crore. However, the actual cash outgo would be Rs 500 crore. It was later passed by the House.
Referring to the Select Committee report on further opening of insurance sector, Jaitley said, "Large investments are waiting to come in. We have to open the doors."
The committee has suggested a composite foreign investment cap of 49 per cent in the insurance sector, as against 26 per cent FDI cap currently.
The government would endeavour to usher in a "civilised tax policy" to attract overseas investments, he said, adding FDI regime has already been relaxed in defence sector and has generated lot of interest from top global manufacturers.
On the growth prospects, Jaitley said there are challenges but hoped that it would be within the projected range of 5.4-5.9 per cent in 2014-15 and cross 6 per cent in the next financial year.
Economic growth fell to sub-5 per cent in two consecutive fiscals in 2012-13 and 2013-14, he said, adding it had an impact on revenue collection, fiscal deficit and government's expenditure on developmental works.
A day ahead of his meeting with state finance ministers, Jaitley said the government will soon release Rs 11,000 crore towards Central Sales Tax (CST) compensation, as part of consensus building for GST rollout.
"...despite difficult and challenging situation, I propose to release about Rs 11,000 crore, which is one-third, this year as a part payment as a CST compensation to the states," he said replying to a debate on Supplementary Demand for Grants in the Lok Sabha.
CST compensation is one sticky issue that has been holding up agreement on introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime to replace all indirect taxes.
Advocating greater powers for states, Jaitley said a principle of 'cooperative federalism' is being followed in setting up the new body in place of Planning Commission.
"Our government stands by the principle of cooperative federalism, empowering states, least number of central schemes and more state schemes," Jaitley said while replying to a debate in the Lok Sabha.

India likely to improve economic growth to 5.9% in 2015  6.3% in 2016: UNIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
India’s economic growth is expected to improve to 6.3 per cent in 2016 with the country leading economic recovery in South Asia, according to a United Nations report.
The UN World Economic Situation and Prospects 2015 (WESP) report, launched here on Wednesday, also said India is likely to make progress in implementing economic policy reforms and help provide support to business and consumer confidence.
It said global economic growth is forecast to continue increasing over the next two years, despite legacies from the financial crisis continuing to weigh on growth, and the emergence of new challenges, including geopolitical conflicts such as in Ukraine, and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
The global economy is expected to grow 3.1 per cent in 2015 and 3.3 per cent in 2016, compared with an estimated growth of 2.6 per cent for 2014, when the pace of expansion has been moderate and uneven.
It said India, which is estimated to record a 5.4 per cent economic growth in 2014, will see GDP growth improving to 5.9 per cent next year and 6.3 per cent in 2016.
Economic growth in South Asia is also set to gradually pick up from an estimated 4.9 per cent in 2014 to 5.4 per cent in 2015 and 5.7 per cent in 2016.
“While the recovery will be led by India, which accounts for about 70 per cent of regional output, other economies such as Bangladesh and Iran are also projected to see stronger growth in the forecast period,” the report said.
The about six per cent growth projected for India in 2016 will be the highest since the 2008-2011 period when it had grown at about 7.3 per cent.
Economic growth had slowed to 4.7 per cent in 2012, according to the UN report.
During 2014, East Asia, including China, managed to register relatively robust growth, while India led South Asia to a moderate strengthening.
Developing countries as a group are expected to grow at 4.8 per cent in 2015 and 5.1 per cent in 2016, up from the 4.3 per cent estimated for 2014.
The report added that along with robust external demand, growth is expected to be underpinned by a moderate strengthening of domestic consumption and investment as countries benefit from improved macroeconomic conditions.
“Several countries, notably India, are likely to make progress in implementing economic policy reforms, thus providing support to business and consumer confidence,” it said.

Gold Climbs Towards 7-Week High as Dollar  Equities SlideJet Fuel Rates Cut Sharply by 12.5%
Singapore: Gold edged towards a seven-week high on Thursday as a sell-off in global equities and the dollar burnished the metal's safe-haven appeal, though weaker oil prices capped gains.
The dollar index fell for a fourth session in a row on strength in the yen, while Asian stocks eased on global growth concerns.
Gold is seen as an alternative investment to riskier assets such as equities. Weakness in the greenback also makes dollar-denominated bullion more attractive.
Five-year-low oil prices kept bullion gains in check. Gold tends to fall in tandem with oil as weaker energy prices dull the metal's appeal as a hedge against oil-led inflation.
"It is good that gold is able to stay above $1,200 despite another slump in oil prices. But it is a little bit concerning we haven't been able to build on it with the dollar weakening quite a bit," said a Hong Kong-based precious metals trader.
"If we stay near $1,230 for a while without making any progress, it might turn out to be bearish," the trader said.
Spot gold had risen 0.2 per cent to $1,229.40 an ounce by 0341 GMT. The metal rose to a seven-week high of $1,238.20 on Wednesday, but failed to hold on to those gains and ended the day down 0.3 per cent.
Safe-haven demand and short covering have been behind gold's recovery from four-and-a-half-year lows hit last month.
An improvement in sentiment was seen in the holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund. The fund saw inflows of nearly 3 tonnes on Wednesday, bringing total holdings to 724.80 tonnes.
That was the fund's second straight day of inflows but holdings are still firmly near six-year lows.
"Should a combination of low oil and shaky equities plus increasing currency uncertainty promote investor risk aversion, then gold may gain on renewed safe-haven buying, especially if there is even a hint of fresh sovereign risk concerns," HSBC analysts said in a note.
Among other precious metals, silver gained for a fourth session to trade near its highest in over a month.
Platinum and palladium gained about 1 per cent each.

Former MP s son found dead on rail tracks near Patna  murder suspectedWritten by Santosh Singh | Patna |
Posted: December 11, 2014 11:17 am
Former Member of Parliament from Munger Dhanraj Singh’s 45-year-old businessman son was found dead on railway tracks near Phulwarisharif in Patna with his body badly mutilated on Wednesday night.
Family suspected murder and alleged involvement of some close relatives.
The Government Railway Police (GRP) said body of Amrendra Singh alias Bablu was found near outer signal of Phulwarisharif, barely four kilometres from Patna railway station where Singh had boarded a train for Jamshedpur where he ran a school.
Police said the body was disfigured and both hands were found cut.
The victim’s mother Rajmani Singh and wife Geeta Singh alleged that Amrendra was “murdered and his body was thrown on railways tracks to pass it off as an accident”.
Geeta Singh, who lives at Patna, said: “Though we are waiting for post-mortem report, my husband’s body has several injury marks on head and eyes suggesting use of sharp weapons. Amrendra had arguments with a relative over business interest recently. We suspect murder and want a thorough investigation”.
Police said Amrendra had clash of interest with some relatives over possession of Raj Tower – a marketing complex at Boring Road here. Amrendra had property dealing business besides ownership of a Jamshedpur school.

Fitch expects to downgrade Japan after next ...Fitch says expects to downgrade Japan after next fiscal year's budget

(Fitch's rating on Japan…)
TOKYO: Fitch Ratings said it expects to downgrade Japan's credit rating sometime early next year after the government delayed a sales tax hike, which would follow a similar downgrade by Moody's as concerns grow about the country's unprecedented debt pile.
Fitch wants to see what type of budget Japan compiles for next fiscal year but has conceded that there is little chance the government will cut spending enough to offset revenue lost from the tax hike delay.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's party is expected to comfortably win a general election on Sunday, but the prospect of another downgrade next year could tarnish his economic credentials and pressure the government to slow spending growth.
"We don't think the environment is conducive for submitting a budget that offsets the delay to the sales tax hike," Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia-Pacific sovereigns at Fitch, said in a conference call.
"Our expectation is the rating will come down."
Fitch's rating on Japan is A plus, which is four notches below the top AAA rating . Fitch is unlikely to consider a downgrade of more than one notch, Colquhoun said.
Abe's decision to delay a sales tax hike to 10 percent from 8 percent may prove popular with voters and ease concerns about flagging growth, but it has all but eliminated any chance of meeting the government's deficit reduction targets.
The tax hike, originally planned for October 2015, was delayed for 18 months after an earlier tax increase this April helped push the economy into a recession.
A government target of halving the primary budget deficit as a ratio of GDP next fiscal year looks unreachable, which means Japan's second target of returning of eliminated the primary budget deficit in fiscal 2020 is not credible, Colquhoun said.
The primary budget deficit excludes debt servicing costs and income from bond sales.
Moody's Investors Service also took the tax hike delay negatively, when it downgraded Japan last week to A1, which is the same level as Fitch's rating.
Japan's government is likely to compile next fiscal year's budget in January.
Abe is planning to cut the corporate tax rate, which would make it even more difficult to close the budget deficit, Colquhoun said.
Japan's public debt, at twice the size of its economy, is larger than Italy's or any other troubled euro-zone nation.
The country's ample domestic savings have financed most of the debt so far, which is a supportive factor for the sovereign rating, Colquhoun said.
The BOJ's quantitative easing, which involves large government debt purchases in the secondary market, is a positive factor because it helps contain funding costs, Colquhoun said.
Standard & Poor's has also cast doubt on Abe's ability to repair Japan's tattered finances. It has an AA- rating on Japan, which is three notches from the top rating of AAA. S&P's rating on Japan has a negative outlook, meaning a downgrade is possible.

Canara Bank holds 51% in life insurance biz: John HoldenJohn Holden, CEO of Canara HSBC OBC Life Insurance shares his views on the recent Insurance Bill.
Below is the verbatim transcript of John Holden's interview with Anuj Singhal and Ekta Batra on CNBC-TV18.
Ekta: To get a couple of details with regards to Canara, HSBC, OBC, can you first tell us how much each of the parties hold within the life insurance business currently and is there any sort of agreement or a prerequisite agreement or understanding which HSBC has to possibly hike stake if in case FDI in insurance comes through?
A: This is a three-way joint venture between three large companies. Canara Bank holds 51 percent, HSBC as a foreign partner holds 26 percent and Oriental Bank of Commerce holds 23 percent. So it is just very simple with three shareholders.
There is provision in the joint venture agreement that makes allowance for what may happen if the FDI comes about and if the law changes that the ratio of shareholdings may change but that will be something that we will be subject to agreement between the shareholders when this happens.
Anuj: Can you tell us what the current provision right now between the three parties, would HSBC have the first right to increase stake to 49 percent if that happens?
A: I am not going to talk about the commercial confidential items of the joint venture agreement on television. That is something for the shareholders to discuss but there is provision within the shareholder agreement such that should things change in the future, each shareholder has rights to change their shareholding with the agreements of others.
Ekta: Would that be at a predetermined price or a fair value assumption or formula that you have come to in case you could throw some light on that?
A: The joint venture agreement does try to somewhat future proof this discussion say that it doesn’t go into a whole wide ranging negotiations. So there is provision within the joint venture agreement, there is a formula based approach so that there is a known path to getting to an agreed price if something were to happen.
Ekta: The composite FDI cap, which has come through, I have been talking to couple of experts on the street and a lot of them are of the opinion that maybe because of the fact that joint venture or a foreign partner holder would want to increase stake from 26 percent to 49 percent, they will not possibly go to the markets to list considering that the cap might come down considering there could be interest from FIIs. Could you give us a sense in terms of what your thoughts are on the composite FDI and whether the life insurance business of Canara HSBC OBC might also have plans in terms of going public?
A: In terms of our company going public, I think that is way too far in the future. We are only six years young for now. In terms of the FDI and FII situation, I think the provision is sensible and interesting because whether there is a combination of the capital coming from an FDI shareholder or from institutional shareholders, there is provision there for both to be possible providing that there is a cap of 49 percent. So that the 51 percent remains under Indian control. I think that is absolutely fine. I think as companies list, it gives the opportunity for FII to come in. But equally as I understand the rules, it means that if an FDI shareholder wants to hold up to 49 percent then that is also possible. So I think that the regulators or the lawmakers are trying to make provision to write good legislation so that everybody can achieve their goals with some flexibility without things being too prescriptive in the law. So I think this is very much an enabling provision.

Business Today brings you snippets from people who made news this past fortnight.
GIVING BACK
He is worth $4 billion and probably the wealthiest Indian in the US. Manoj Bhargava, who founded 5-hour ENERGY, the flavoured 'energy shot' brand, now wants to give back to his native country. He has, in fact, committed over 90 per cent of his wealth to what he claims is his most expensive hobby, philanthropy.
"Since I'm too old to play with toys and I live a simple life, I decided to help my country since it is an ocean of need," said Bhargava, who set up his own charity, The Hans Foundation, in 2009 and has donated money to more than 150 charities in India.
In the country recently, he pledged Rs 500 crore, spread over six years, for the development of Uttarakhand. The money would be used to fund school lunches for children and provide clean drinking water as well as smokeless stoves in villages. "Simple things are what make a difference to people's lives, not high-tech announcements," he says.

Employees today expect a lot more from their employers and it is imperative for the latter to live up to those expectations, says Mark Spears, of the Netherlandsbased leading auditing firm KPMG.
"There is a demand to learn. (Employees) want to learn quickly. They want to progress quickly. They want to be challenged and at the same time they want to learn from the organisation they are working for," says Spears, who first came to India in 2006 to watch an India-England cricket match, which England won.
According to him, employees are keen on having a holistic learning programme while working for an organisation. "It is not about a straight line anymore… (It is about) what are you offering in terms of horizontal experience." Employees must be allowed to move around within an organisation "so (that) they get more opportunity, get more challenged and they won't mind staying with (the company)".

CCEA approves pricing mechanism for ethanol procurement by OMCsCCEA approves pricing mechanism for ethanol procurement by OMCs
Our Bureau
Price to be based on distance of sugar mills from oil depots
New Delhi, Dec 11:  
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved a mechanism late on Tuesday evening for ethanol procurement by public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) which should provide respite to the beleaguered industry.
The CCEA approved the delivered price of ethanol to be fixed in the range of Rs 48.50-49.50/litre depending on the distance of the sugar mill from the oil depot. If the mill lies between 0-100 km then the applicable rate would be Rs 48.50/litre, while it would be Rs 49 and Rs 49.50 if the mills lie between 101-300 km and more than 300 km from the depot.
The proposed rates will be the delivered price at the depots and are inclusive of all Central and State taxes and transportation costs that are borne by the ethanol supplier. The OMCs will incorporate a 'Supply or Pay' clause backed by a bank guarantee in the supply agreement.
They will also sign memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with the State Governments for uninterrupted inter-depot transfer of ethanol within a State. This may include annual excise permits to OMCs for movement of ethanol and other relayed measures.
Significant move
The CCEA approval should see sugar mills, who currently owe about Rs 3,000 crore to sugarcane farmers, improving their balance sheets to some degree.
Nearly 90 mills out of 119 have begun crushing in Uttar Pradesh, the country's second largest sugar producing State, after much uncertainty, including threats of suspending operations at the beginning of the season on October 1.
The Government had decided on a mandatory 5 per cent blending of ethanol with petrol in late 2012, but the OMCs had not been getting enough ethanol with offers received for only 45 per cent of the total requirement in 2013-14.
The mechanism decided by the CCEA could be replaced by a new mechanism of uniform price of ethanol declared each year. At present, ethanol is priced at about Rs 42/litre but suppliers usually incur an additional Rs 6-8/litre.
In some cases, prices quoted by the sugar mills are higher than the benchmark 'refinery transfer price' (RTP), which is based on the average RTP of the previous financial year. As a result, procurement is less than what is offered. The CCEA move is, therefore, likely to reduce that uncertainty.

Vladimir Putin s India visit: Russia agrees to construct 12 nuclear reactorsIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
Russia’s state-owned Rosatom said it would supply 12 nuclear energy reactors for India over 20 years, under an agreement aimed at boosting nuclear energy cooperation signed by the two countries during a summit in New Delhi on Thursday.
A 1,000-megawatt reactor is operating at the Russian-built Kudankulam power station in India’s Tamil Nadu province, with a second due to come onstream in 2015.
Russian President Vladimir Putin had been pushing for Rosatom to increase the number of reactors it could supply to as many as 25.
Indian officials say that a total of six reactors will be built at Kudankulam, with a further six to follow at a site that has not yet been determined.

Badaun case: CBI files closure report  rules out murder and rapeBadaun case: CBI files closure report, rules out murder and rape
Press Trust of India | Badaun Dec 11, 2014 01:55 PM IST
CBI today filed a closure report in the death of two teenage cousins in Badaun in western Uttar Pradesh, ruling out murder and rape and concluding that it was a case of suicide.
The agency filed its report before Special Judge Anil Kumar here saying there was no forensic or circumstantial evidence suggesting rape and murder as alleged in the FIR registered by the Uttar Pradesh Police after the bodies of the two girls were found hanging from a tree in May this year.
The matter has been listed for January 6, 2015, according to Additional District Government Counsel Rajiv Kumar.
The agency said the two girls had committed suicide fearing retribution as the affair of the elder girl with a local boy from different caste had come light.
The final report mentions questionable actions of the fathers of the girls, an uncle and main witness Nazru, also a distant relative, leaving it to the court to take further action, sources said.
The bodies of the two cousins, both around 14 years of age, were found hanging in an orchard on May 28. The girls' families had alleged that they were kidnapped and murdered by five youths from the village. The incident sparked an outcry in the country and abroad with questions being raised over the law and order situation. Even United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon had expressed concern.
CBI said that there was no evidence of rape or murder as there was no sign of struggle on their clothes and bodies. The agency said forensic analysis also revealed that there was no male DNA or sperm on their bodies.
The agency closed the investigations with dropping of charges against five accused - Pappu, Awadhesh and Urvesh Yadav (brothers) and constables Chhatrapal Yadav and Sarvesh Yadav - named as prime accused by the state police for the alleged rape and murder of the girls.
They said a recommendation for probe against state police officers for botched up investigation will be made.
The sources said the case will also be an example of how the system of post-mortem can be improved to help investigators arrive at correct conclusions.
The theory of rape and murder fell flat in view of the findings in forensic reports received from three-member medical board, Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, FSL, Gandhinagar among others.
"Based on around 40 scientific reports, CBI has concluded that the two minor girls in the Badaun case had not been raped and murdered as had been alleged in the FIR. Investigation has concluded that it is a case of suicide," CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad had said.

PM Narendra Modis intervention sought for securing release of 24fishermenBy: Press Trust of India | Chennai |
Posted: December 11, 2014 2:47 pm
The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately secure the release of 24 Indian fishermen from the state, who were captured by Bangladeshi authorities recently.
The 24 fishermen had gone for deep sea fishing in three boats from Bettuagad near Kolkata in West Bengal on November 17 and were arrested by Bangladesh Navy for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line on December 9, Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said.
In a letter to the Prime Minister, he said the ‘innocent fishermen’ were the sole breadwinners of their families and that their arrest and detention will severely affect their dependents.
Panneerselvam urged Modi to direct officials of External Affairs Ministry to coordinate with the Indian High Commission in Dhaka “and intervene at the diplomatic level to secure the immediate release of these 24 poor fishermen from Tamil Nadu.”

We will not cut price, compromise on safety: Siemens Healthcare
PTI
Tweet
Chicago, Dec 11:  
Global conglomerate Siemens has made it clear that it will not compromise on quality and safety by reducing prices of its healthcare devices in India even though it considers the country a difficult market to sell its products.
“Overall, we see quite strong (growth) in India although we agree that India is a difficult country. Our plan is not to just reduce costs,” Siemens Healthcare global CEO Hermann Requardt said during a media interaction here.
Stating that the German company will not compromise on safety and efficacy of its products, he said: “We feel that (being) cost competitive is to translate what the clinical requirements are. We will not compromise on that.”
In India, there are local players manufacturing X-ray equipment with low voltages. “You get lot of dose but get very little imaging information. That is not our strategy,” he added.
On being asked whether the company was planning to expand its manufacturing facilities in India, Requardt said it will ramp up its present facility in Goa but it is not looking at setting up another facility.
“We have a strong basis in Goa, where we roll out equipment for local markets and that gives us momentum. We will increase our investments there because what is accepted in India is also accepted in Africa and other developing countries,” he said without divulging investment figures.
The company said it is not planning to set up another manufacturing unit because there is lot of potential in the Goa plant and it will be making more investments there.

Lok Sabha adjourned on Muslims conversion issue in Uttar PradeshIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
Opposition today created uproar in Lok Sabha over the issue of religious conversion in Agra, prompting the government to say it was ready to build a consensus on having a legislation on conversion.
As soon as the House met for the day, Opposition members belonging to Congress, TMC, SP, RJD and AAP came to the Well demanding suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue of alleged religious conversions and re-conversions.
Speaker Sumitra Mahajan declined to suspend Question Hour, saying she would allow Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge to speak during Zero Hour and if necessary allow a discussion.
Her repeated pleas did not yield any result and the opposition continued to protest and raise the slogan ‘Hindu, Muslim, Sikhs bhai bhai’.
While members belonging to NCP, AIMIM and Left parties kept protesting from aisle, the Question Hour continued with most of the questions being taken up.
Acknowledging that it is a serious issue, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said, “Government is ready to discuss and build a consensus on having a legislation on (religious) conversion.”
Kharge said the matter should be taken up as a special case. “It is a very, very serious matter and there is threat to the unity of the country,” he said.
He said religious conversions are happening and everybody is giving statements outside the House and even encouraging such things.
Countering the allegation, Naidu said, “There is no problem to safety, unity and integrity of the country… Don’t politicise the issue.”
SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav also spoke something which was not audible.
As the din continued, the Speaker said proper notice should be given as the government has already expressed its willingness to discuss the matter.
“You are interested in slogans only, you are not interested in discussions… This is not the proper way,” she told the protesting members.
With the Speaker not accepting the opposition demand, Kharge wondered whether the discussion should take place on the streets.
As the pandemonium continued, Mahajan adjourned the House for 10 minutes till 12.05 PM.

Uproar in RS over Godse eulogyUproar in RS over Godse eulogy
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 01:55 PM IST
Rajya Sabha today witnessed uproarious scenes with members from Congress 
lodging strong protest against eulogising of Nathuram Godse at a function held in Maharashtra earlier this month. 
Under attack from the opposition members, government disapproved of any such event hailing Mahatma Gandhi's killer but said no organisation should be defamed.
The Upper House saw two brief adjournments over the issue as Congress members protested holding placards in the aisles and raising slogans, while charging right-wing organisations with lending their support to it.
Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Husain Dalwai (Cong) said he has written to Maharashtra Chief Minister over hosting the event attended by some religious leaders and former MLAs.
"Mahatma Gandhi's killer is being eulogised by hosting his 'Shaurya Diwas' in Maharashtra...These people talk of development, but are trying to create a rift in society," he said, accusing the right-wing organisations of indulging in such things, including religious conversions that created tension in society.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, "This is not acceptable. Mahatma Gandhi's killer, whosoever it may be, we are against it...We do not accept any honour of Mahatma Gandhi's killers."

Hong Kong police arrest pro-democracy protesters in maincampBy: Associated Press | Hong Kong |
Posted: December 11, 2014 3:17 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 3:22 pm
Hong Kong police on Thursday took away demonstrators who refused to leave the main pro-democracy protest camp and tore down their tents in a final push to retake streets occupied by activists for two and a half months.
The first person arrested was carried away by four officers by her arms and legs.
The students and other activists have been protesting Beijing’s restrictions on the first election for Hong Kong’s leader, though the movement’s momentum has been fading in recent weeks.
Many protesters had heeded police warnings to leave the protest zone in Hong Kong’s city center, but dozens of students, pro-democracy lawmakers and others, including middle-aged and elderly supporters, remained Thursday afternoon. The students at the front lay down and locked arms.
Earlier Thursday, workers carrying out a court order removed barricades on the edge of the protest site before officers moved in and dismantled tents. They had warned protesters that they faced arrest if they did not leave.
“I think the spirit of the movement still lives, but the idea of occupying streets is over,” said student Andrew Chan, 20, as he left the site. “We can’t even get a big crowd to come out today to fight the police clearing the site.”
Tents and canopies that had housed water and other supplies for the protesters lay in heaps among discarded newspapers, flip-flops, cardboard boxes and umbrellas, which became a symbol of the protest movement after students used them to deflect police pepper spray.

One of the student leaders, Alex Chow, had rallied the crowds as the police approached, saying their fight was not over and they would find other ways to press forward in the days to come.
The protesters reject Beijing’s restrictions on the first election for the city’s top leader, scheduled for 2017, but have failed to win any concessions from Hong Kong’s government.
The sprawling encampment in Hong Kong’s Admiralty section, on the edge of the financial district, has been the focal point for the protesters, who have occupied the site for 75 days.
As the clear-out neared, protesters chanted “I want universal suffrage” and tossed pieces of paper that read “We will be back.”
In addition to hundreds of journalists at the scene, a group of about 30 academics was monitoring the police operation, as were the Independent Police Complaints Council and human rights groups.
On Sept. 28 police fired dozens of tear gas rounds at thousands of protesters gathering in the area angry over the prolonged detention of student leaders. The move infuriated protesters and the wider public and kick-started the student-led protest movement, which came to include two other protest sites in Hong Kong.

Police say 655 people have been arrested over the past 2 months, and that 129 officers were injured. They have given no overall injury toll.
A separate court order led to the clearing of the Mong Kok protest site in late November. That operation and ensuing nighttime clashes in the gritty neighborhood’s surrounding streets resulted in about 160 arrests.
On the eve of Thursday’s action to clear the Admiralty area, thousands of protesters and supporters streamed into the site for one last night of the “Umbrella Movement.”
Two student groups that played key roles in organizing the protests had called for supporters to stay until the last moment, but not to resist authorities.
“If the government wants to use police to clear the site, don’t forget, the clearance can’t resolve political conflicts, it can’t resolve society’s dilemma,” said Joshua Wong, the 18-year-old head of the Scholarism group and the pro-democracy movement’s most prominent leader.

Tamil Nadu govt seeks PM Modis intervention for fishermenreleasePosted: December 11, 2014 2:51 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 2:52 pm
 
Tamil Nadu government on Thursday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately secure the release of 24 Indian fishermen from the state, who were captured by Bangladeshi authorities recently.
The 24 fishermen had gone for deep sea fishing in three boats from Bettuagad near Kolkata in West Bengal on November 17 and were arrested by Bangladesh Navy for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line on December 9, Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said.
In a letter to the Prime Minister, he said the ‘innocent fishermen’ were the sole breadwinners of their families and that their arrest and detention will severely affect their dependents.
Panneerselvam urged Modi to direct officials of External Affairs Ministry to coordinate with the Indian High Commission in Dhaka “and intervene at the diplomatic level to secure the immediate release of these 24 poor fishermen from Tamil Nadu.”

(Shares of SpiceJet continued…)
NEW DELHI: Shares of SpiceJet continued their downward trend, slipping over 7 per cent in intraday trade on Thursday.
The fall comes despite the low-cost carrier getting some relief on Wednesday with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) giving it another five days to pay dues amounting to about Rs 200 crore.
SpiceJet shares have fallen 24% since December 1 when the payment trouble at the company erupted.
Today, the airline is offering cut-price fares on some sectors; in some instances almost half of what is charged by rivals. This falied to revive sentiment on the Street.
Also, the company seems to have failed to benefit from falling crude prices that is a huge factor in improving profit margins.
Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala picked 75 lakh shares of SpiceJet for more than Rs 13 crore through open market route in November end; though he tacitly said that he was not bullish on the stock.

Audi plans to launch 10 new models in India next yearAudi plans to launch 10 new models in India next year
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 02:36 PM IST
German luxury car maker Audi plans to launch around 10 new models in India next year as it looks to further consolidate its position in the country.
The company, which today launched the compact convertible Audi A3 Cabriolet in India priced at Rs 44.75 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), currently sells 17 models in the country.
"Next year we plan to launch around ten products in the Indian market. It is going to be an exciting and busy year for us," Audi India Head Joe King told PTI.
Elaborating further, he said the products would be the combination of new variants of existing model range as well as products catering to new segments.
Terming 2014 as the company's best year so far in India, King said it has already surpassed last year's sales figure and is set to further enhance its market share in the luxury segment.
Besides, the company is also preparing to bring in more investments into the country, he added.
"We are looking to bring in next round of investments into the country, keeping in mind the immense long term potential of the Indian market," King said.
He, however, did not share further details.
Commenting on the A3 Cabriolet launch, King said the compact luxury segment is growing the fastest in the luxury car industry and the introduction of compact convertible will further strengthen the company's dominance in this space.
The four seater car comes with a lightweight soft top, sporting a 1.8 litre petrol engine with a top speed of 242 km/h.
"First showcased at the Auto Expo this year, the car received an overwhelming response from customers which prompted us to introduce the product in India," King said.
In 2013, Audi sold 10,002 units in India, becoming the first luxury car maker to cross the 10,000-unit milestone and stay as the number one ahead of German rivals Mercedes (9,003 units) and BMW (7,327 units).
Earlier this year, the company had launched the A3 sedan in India. It is the first model from the Audi stable to be locally produced before being launched in India.
Other models, such as sedans A6 and A4; SUVs Q5, Q7 and Q3, which are locally produced now, were imported as completely built units (CBUs) at the time of launch.
The annual capacity at VW group firm Skoda's Aurangabad plant for all Audi models is more than 14,000 units in a one-shift operation.

Middle class diamond purchases up four-fold in 12 years in India: De BeersMiddle class diamond purchases up four-fold in 12 years in India: De Beers
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 10:32 PM IST
The acquisition rate of diamonds in India’s middle class has risen fourfold in the last 12 years, which indicates the country quickly developing a diamond consumer market to complement its pre-eminence as a leading policy centre, a leading diamond miner said.
Speaking at the World Diamond Conference, Stephen Lussier, executive vice-president of marketing for The De Beers Group of Companies, said, “The acquisition rate for diamonds in India’s middle class has risen sharply from two per cent in 2002 to nine per cent in 2014. The favourable environment for further diamond consumption growth in India’s number of middle class households is forecast to grow by a compound annual rate of 12 per cent over the next decade.” This was the finding of De Beers’ recent consumer diamond purchasing survey in India, he added.
Currently, India imports approximately 90 per cent of its rough diamond requirement from trading centres such as the European Union, Israel and United Arab Emirates; and only 10 per cent of its rough purchase comes directly from producing countries such as Russia, Australia, Canada and Africa. However, Lussier, who is also CEO of De Beers’ jewellery brand Forevermark, cautioned that increased competition from other luxury products means the  industry must capitalise on opportunities in areas such as online marketing and branding is to maximise its potential.
Underlining De Beers’ commitment to India, the company has invested nearly $10 million in a state-of-the-art inscription and grading operation in Surat, which has the initial capacity to inscribe 400,000 diamonds – dramatically improving the service for its Indian-based Forevermark partners. Rio Tinto Diamonds managing director Jean-Marc Lieberherr said “Our partnership with the Indian diamond industry is a 30-year journey that covers everything from diamond manufacturing technology to unique market development initiatives and the first diamond discovery in India in decades.
Rio Tinto has underscored the importance of its strategic partnership in India in driving growth and future opportunities in the global industry. Rio Tinto is currently developing the Bunder diamond project in Madhya Pradesh, which is set to put India among the top 10 diamond producer countries in the world.
“The Bunder project is positive proof of the natural abundance and prospectivity of India and provides the ideal opportunity to showcase a new benchmark for mine development in India. The opportunity to produce diamonds mined, manufactured and marketed in India on a commercial scale is exciting and very much aligned to the ‘Make in India’ campaign.”
The Bunder project, discovered in 2004 and currently awaiting approvals, will generate an estimated 30,000 jobs and huge economic benefits for India.
Lieberherr said Rio Tinto’s Argyle Diamonds mine in Australia would be delivering increased volumes from 2015, which would have a direct impact on the Indian manufacturing sector.
Further downstream Rio Tinto Diamonds is continuing its focus on the retail sector with its flagship Indian marketing initiative, “Nazraana” which promotes affordable diamond jewellery as gifts for all occasions.
The conference was organised by the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council in association with the World Diamond Mark Foundation and attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
India is set to ink a pact with the world’s leading Russian diamond miner Alrosa for direct supply of rough diamonds to India.

Banning taxi service not a solution  says GadkariBanning taxi service not a solution, says Gadkari
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News –  Tue 9 Dec, 2014

New Delhi, Dec 9 (IANS) Banning Uber, an international taxi-booking service, does not make sense, said union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari Tuesday, adding that modern services like these should be encouraged and if there is some lacuna, it should be rectified.
"It doesn't make sense to ban services. Tomorrow, if something happens on a bus, we can't ban that. Similarly, if something of this sort happens on a plane, that too cannot be banned," the minister told reporters here.
"Modern concepts like these are being implemented in countries like the UK, the US and others, and we too must encourage it," Gadkari said on being asked whether these application-based services should be banned in the country.
"It's up to the state governments since it comes under their subject list, but services like these are useful and if there is any problem or lacuna that can be fixed," he said.
The minister said that the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, would also be changed.
"We will have a centre where record of all drivers would be maintained," he said.

Flurry of IPOs in 2015 lifts fund raising to 2-yearhighStreet sees good show after stellar year
India Inc’s fund raising through initial public offerings (IPO) rose to a two-year high this fiscal, according to data from Prime Database and market sources. Corporates have mobilised over R1,400 crore so far in FY15, up 16.3% from full-year FY14 IPO activity, data showed.
Five companies – Sharda Cropchem (R351 crore), Monte Carlo Fashions (R350 crore), Snowman Logistics (R197 crore), Wonderla Holidays (R181 crore) and Shemaroo Entertainment (R120 crore) – raised R1,200 crore on the main board for the eight months to December. An additional 26 companies mobilised R201 crore on the SME platform of stock exchanges.

Investment bankers said the “business-friendly” tag and slew of reforms undertaken, and in the reckoning, by the new government are among the factors prompting companies into capacity expansion a nd debt reduction.
More importantly, the secondary market performance has given corporates and bankers greater confidence on investor appetite and better valuations. More companies will follow suit in the last quarter of FY15, they said.
“I think everyone was waiting for the elections. There will be a flurry of activity in the IPO market. Elections played a big role,” said Ajay Saraf, ED & head of corporate finance and institutional equities, ICICI Securities in a recent interview.
If market data is to be relied upon, another eight to 10 companies have received observations from Sebi. These companies have the potential to raise anywhere between R4,500-6,000 crore. These include Rashtriya Ispat Nigam (RINL) which could raise R2,000-2,500 crore as part of the government’s FY15 disinvestment programme, Inox Wind (R700 crore), Adlabs Entertainment (R500 crore), and Lavasa Corp (R750 crore).
Bankers explained that primary markets lag the pick-up in secondary markets by about six to eight months. While the Street foresees investor fatigue to creep in, given the huge pipeline of equity fund raising, investment bankers remain confident about the sustainability of the bull market and fund raising activity connected with it.
Indian markets are the second-best performing markets in the world, closely following China. The Sensex has garnered returns of more than 31% in CY14.
Investment bankers said the markets will be governed by mid-market deals ($100-300 million), but ruled out the possibility of very large-sized (bulge-bracket) IPOs like Coal India, Reliance Power, DLF, or even Alibaba in the US.
Corporates raised R1,204 crore last year and about R6,500 crore the year prior. India Inc saw record fund raising in FY11 (R33,097.77 crore).
“We expect the momentum to sustain on the back of a stable government. Unless something untoward happens, this could lead to a long-term cycle of equity fund raising. If things go as planned on the economy, this could be the biggest long-term bull market we are going to see,” said the head of a global investment banking firm in Mumbai.

Insurance Bill: Parliamentary panel pitches for 49% foreign investment capA Parliamentary Committee on Wednesday recommended a composite foreign investment cap of 49 per cent in the insurance sector and supported a government Bill to amend the Act.
At present, a limit of 26 per cent is allowed only through the FDI route.
“The Committee recommends that the composite cap of 49 per cent should be inclusive of all forms of foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investments,” said the report tabled in the Rajya Sabha.
The Rajya Sabha had in August appointed a 15-member Select committee to scrutinise the long pending Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008. The Bill was held up for nearly six years on account of political differences.
The government is likely to bring the Bill for consideration of the Upper House as early as next week.
The panel report, however, contains dissent notes from four members —— P Rajeev (CPI—M), Derek O’Brien (TMC), Ram Gopal Yadav (SP) and K C Tyagi (JDU).
The panel, headed by Rajya Sabha MP Chandan Mitra, has suggested inclusion of a person from the insurance industry in the Securities Appellate Tribunal as an expert.
It has recommended suitable amendment to the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act for the inclusion.
The panel also recommended that penalties on insurance companies be linked to seriousness of offences committed by them. It has suggested mechanism to ensure that there is minimum scope for subjective interpretation.
The Standing Committee on Finance headed by senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha in 2011 had rejected the proposal to hike FDI to 49 per cent in the insurance sector, saying it may not have the desired effect and could expose the economy to global vulnerability.

President Putin’s comes to India when Russia is reeling under Western sanctions
New Delhi, December 10:  
When Russian President Vladimir Putin meets Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, the camaraderie will be more than usual as Moscow is in as much need of a steady trading partner as New Delhi.
The two leaders are expected to lay the ground for greater trade between the two countries in products such as diamonds, farm goods, heavy machinery and pharmaceuticals.
Ties in defence, civil aviation, and energy — including civil nuclear — will also form a significant part of the discussions.
Putin comes here at a time when his country is facing sanctions from Western powers, and Russia, in turn, has reduced trade with them following the Ukraine crisis. India, on the other hand, is looking for greater trade ties closer home.
“Russia has already made a beginning by allowing import of buffalo meat and dairy items from India. We expect the visit to result in further deepening of trade and investments,” a Government official, who did not want to be identified, told BusinessLine.
On the energy front, the two leaders are expected to oversee commercial deals as well as some policy tie-ups.
Putin and Modi are likely to announce a Joint Study Group (JSG) to look at the feasibility of a Free Trade Agreement between the two countries. The FTA will aim at multiplying the present low level of bilateral trade of $6 billion by bringing down tariffs on key products and removing non-tariff barriers on both goods and services.
India’s exports to Russia at present are less than 1 per cent of that country’s total imports. New Delhi is hopeful of getting Moscow to agree to turn India into a diamond hub by selling diamonds directly to it.
“We could save a considerable amount in commissions charged by trading hubs like Brussels if diamonds come directly to India,” the official said.
India has to sort out certain taxation issues before it is profitable for diamond exporters to treat it as a full-fledged hub, but the Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council is hopeful of signing pacts for dealing in small quantities of diamond with Russian company Alrosa during the President’s visit.
Pharmaceuticals is another area where there could be collaborations between the two as Russia wants to buy generics from India.

Russian  Indian funds to invest $1 bn in hydro powerRussian, Indian funds to invest $1 bn in hydro power

The Russian Direct Investment Fund will team up with an Indian partner to invest $1 billion in hydroelectric projects in Asia's third-largest economy, the head of the Russian state fund told Reuters on Wednesday.
The RDIF and India's IDFC, a leading infrastructure investor, will each commit $500 million to projects under a deal to be signed on Thursday during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to overcome India's chronic power shortages, and the country has vast untapped hydroelectric potential in its Himalayan belt.
RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev told Reuters the investments would back projects involving a large Russian hydro-power company but he declined to name the company.
The only large Russian player in this area is state-controlled Rushydro. Rushydro's spokeswoman Yelena Vishnyakova could not immediately be reached by for comment.
IDFC, which is 16 per cent state owned, confirmed it would sign a partnership with RDIF but declined to comment on the details.
The Russian fund was set up in 2011 with $10 billion in state funds. It can back investments as long as its partners match it at least dollar for dollar. Dmitriev said he expected to commit funds to the Indian projects next year.
The RDIF has so far invested $1.3 billion of its own money along with $6 billion by outside investors, mainly sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Asia.
Dmitriev said the RDIF had managed to turn profits on investments in a Russian telecoms company and the Moscow stock exchange despite Western sanctions, a slowing economy and sliding oil prices.

Mumbai: After a day's breather, Indian stocks continued their downslide on Thursday with benchmark Sensex tumbling 229.09 points to six-week low of 27,602.01 on sharp losses in RIL and ONGC after further drop in crude oil price.
Similarly, the 50-issue CNX Nifty of the NSE also plunged by 62.75 points, or 0.75 per cent, to end below 8,300-mark for the first time after one and half months at 8,292.90.
In line fall in local equities, the Indian rupee fell to nine-month low levels of 62.3 against the greenback. Weak Asian trends on the back of overnight steep fall on Wall Street amid slow down in capital inflows weighed on the stock market sentiment.
Besides RIL and ONGC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, TCS, Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Gail India suffered marked losses.

Besides Oil&Gas, realty, IT, power and banking counters also suffered heavy losses while only some of the defensive pharma stocks attracted some buying interest.
Besides RIL and ONGC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, TCS, Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Gail India suffered marked losses.
Brent crude oil fell to five-year low below US dollar 65 a barrel, putting pressure on oil companies. The BSE 30-share barometer resumed lower on weak Asian cues and moved in negative terrain throughout the day before concluding at 27,602.01, a fall of 229.09 points or 0.82 per cent. This is its weakest close since 27,346.33 on October 30.
On Wednesday, Sensex had snapped a three-day falling trend as it recovered by about 34.09 points or 0.12 per cent.
"Weak Asian markets and fresh fears from Euro region kept Indian markets volatile. Mixed sentiments on the back of weak rupee and lower oil too added to the volatility. FII liquidity outflow on the back of profit booking too added to weakness," said Hiren Dhakan, Associate Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio.
Investors were also cautious ahead of the release of Consumer Price Index-based inflation and Index of Industrial Production scheduled on Friday.
A total 11 out of 12 BSE sectoral barometers ended in the red. Market breadth was weak as about 1,750 stocks fell, 1,139 rose and about 100 ended flat.
Bucking the overall weak trend, sugar stocks were in limelight after government fixed higher price for ethanol procurement by PSU oil firms.

Moneycontrol Bureau
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley yesterday announced the government would pay Rs 11,000 crore towards compensation to states for losses incurred towards rollout of CST.
The FM’s statement comes even as the government is struggling in its fiscal position, with 90 percent of the FY2015 fiscal deficit target having been reached in the first seven months of the year (till October).
The move, Jaitley said, was a step towards “restoring the trust deficit” between states and the Centre on the issue of CST and would help boost the rollout of GST.
"Despite a difficult and challenging (fiscal) situation, I propose to release about Rs 11,000 crore, a third (of the total CST compensation of Rs 34,000 crore sought by states), this year as part-payment of CST compensation to the states,” Jaitley said in Parliament. “This will take care of the amounts from 2010-11 onwards. The balance of the amount, I will start paying from the next financial year onwards.”
As a background, CST, a tax imposed on the inter-state movement of goods, was reduced from 4 percent to 3 percent in 2007-08 and further to 2 percent in 2008-09 after the UPA-led central government introduced the value-added tax (VAT). It had then promised the states that it would bear losses arising out reduction in CST, which were later agreed upon to be Rs 33,000 crore.
However, in Budget 2013-14, then finance minister P Chidambaram had provided for only Rs 9,000 crore towards compensation, out of which only Rs 1,900 crore was eventually released .
It was this trust deficit that had partly become a roadblock in the rollout of the goods and sales tax, the most ambitious tax reform that will subsume most state and federal level taxes and levies (such as excise duty, service tax, VAT, entry tax, etc) into itself.
Wanting to avoid a similar experience as they underwent with VAT, states have been insisting the Centre make a constitutional provision in the GST bill that will mandate it to make up for their losses.
The NDA government (as was the UPA government), not wanting to be squeezed into a corner in a rough fiscal year, has been unwilling to commit as much but in recent developments, Jaitley has reportedly prevailed upon states to agree to create a GST council (comprising of the Union FM and state FMs) that will sort out compensation issues.
However, even with the CST issue hopefully out of the way, it seems unlikely the GST bill will be tabled in Parliament in the Winter session that ends on December 22.
This was indicated by minister of state for finance Jayant Sinha in an interaction with CNBC-TV18. The minister said the “current legislative calendar was packed” and that the next step on GST would be decided at Jaitley’s meeting with state FMs, which takes place today. (The minister did reiterate, however, that the tax’s rollout is on target for April 2016.)
While Jaitley may have likely sorted out the CST compensation issue and got a step closer to its implementation, there still are issues that need to be solved: such as the fate of alcohol, tobacco and petroleum with many states wanting the lucrative items to be kept out of GST’s ambit.

FII inflows to halve to USD 20 bn in 2015: Credit SuisseFII inflows to halve to USD 20 billion in 2015, says Credit Suisse
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 12:34 IST

Credit Suisse, the Swiss brokerage, on Wednesday said the robust foreign investment inflows into the country's debt and equities markets will halve to US $18-20 billion in 2015 on a slowdown in the sovereign wealth funds' (SWFs) play.
"The FII ( foreign institutional investors ) inflows into the domestic markets will come down to US $18-20 billion in the next 12 months, which is half of the current inflows," Managing Director for Equity Research Neelkanth Mishra told reporters in Mumbai.
Mishra attributed this primarily to a possible slowdown in pumping in money by the SWFs, which are short on allocatable resources due to the fall in the crude oil prices.
FIIs hold as much as 27 per cent in the over US $1.6 trillion market capitalisation of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex as of the September quarter, which is at a historic high.
Currently, the fund inflows are almost evenly split between debt and equities, (as there is a US $25 billion cap on FIIs' holdings in government bonds , though there is a huge demand for more) and Mishra pointed to his in-house research, which said around 40-50 per cent of the inflows into domestic equities come from SWFs.
When asked about flows from pension funds and insurance companies, Mishra acknowledged they are getting interested in domestic markets, saying they spend a lot of time in due diligence before taking an investment call.
They move slowly and there will not be a dramatic uptick in their interest over the span of a single year, he said.
Mishra said he expects returns of 30 per cent from the equity markets over the next two years or 15 per cent per annum growth, but did not give a target level for the indices.
It can be noted that oil prices have slid to a five-year low of US $66-67 to a barrel. Since June, there has been a massive 35 per cent fall in the domestic basket of Brent crude.
Many of the countries in the Middle East like the UAE and Oman have very active SWFs.
Even though the policy-makers sometimes blame such flows to be "fickle", the FII inflows are important for funding the current account gap and reducing the overall deficit, which surged up to 2.1 per cent in the second quarter as against 1.2 per cent a year-ago.
It can also be noted that the BSE index Sensex has been the second best performer YTD across the globe with a 35 per cent rally after the Shanghai index which jumped 47 per cent. Many analysts are commenting that Chinese stocks , due to cheaper valuation may spoil the Sensex party in 2015.
Several foreign brokerages have given a very promising year for the BSE barometer with some of them seeing it at 33,000-level at the end of December 2015.
Mishra said the domestic GDP (gross domestic product) growth will be handsome and the country will be one of the few pockets which will show good numbers, as the world is expected to struggle on the growth front.
The equity research MD said he does not expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to deliver an interest rate cut before March, as inflation may go up in January and the central bank's Governor Raghuram Rajan wants to conclusively see a downward trend in the trajectory before he starts cutting policy rates.

IFC investment in India to cross $1.9 bn in 2014IFC investment in India to cross $1.9 bn in 2014
T E NARASIMHAN | Chennai Dec 11, 2014 12:22 PM IST
With the proposed $150-million commitment (debt and equity) in Axis Bank, the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC’s) investments in India in 2014 will cross $1.9 billion, of which equity alone is estimated to be around $800 million. The World Bank’s investment arm has since 1956 invested in 377 companies in India, providing over $10.3 billion (till June 30 this year) in financing for its own account and $2.9 billion in mobilisation from external resources.
So far this year, IFC has invested $1.9 billion in India across 30 deals. The investments have already exceeded the $820 million it had committed itself to in 2013. According to Venture Intelligence, IFC invested $800 million in equity across 17 transactions, of which it invested alone (without any co-investor) in 10 transactions.
During financial year 2014, IFC invested in 30 companies across sectors like renewable energy (ACME Solar, Azure Power, DJ Energy and others), banks (Kotak, Axis Bank, Federal Bank, Ratnakar Bank and YES Bank), microfinance institutions (Bandhan, Equitas, Janalakshmi, Magma, Suryoday, Ujjivan), telecommunication (Idea Cellurlar), infrastructure (UltraTech Cement, Uttar Urja Projects).
India is the biggest investment destination for IFC. As of June 30, its portfolio in the country stood at $4.7 billion, with a focus on energy, water, roads, phone connections, health care, education, sanitation, waste management, and financial inclusion.
IFC has invested around $255 million in MFIs and NBFCs, including Bandhan, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance, Punjab National Bank Housing Finance Ltd, Janalaxmi Financial Services, Vistaar Financial Services, Magma Fincorp Ltd and Au Financiers Ltd, so far this year.
This is in addition to the $120 million invested in the sector in 2013, when IFC put money in companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd, Equitas Microfinance, Ujjivan Financial Services, Suryoday Microfinance and IFMR Rural Channel and Services.
Strategy
IFC has been concentrating on low-income, rural, and fragile regions while building infrastructure and assisting public-private partnerships; facilitating renewable energy generation; promoting cleaner production, energy and water efficiency; supporting agriculture; creating growth opportunities for small businesses; reforming investment climate; encouraging low-income housing; and making affordable healthcare accessible.
IFC is undertaking focused business development efforts to find investment opportunities in frontier countries in the South Asian region and frontier regions within India. However, IFC is also seeing new prospects in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka prospects for new investments.
“IFC aims to promote inclusive growth, particularly in the low-income states of India and post-conflict and frontier parts of the region; help address climate change impacts; and encourage global and regional integration, including promoting investments from South Asia into Africa. Inclusion, climate change, and integration are three pillars of our strategy in the South Asian region,” said IFC.

FAA s Delhi visit raises hope of aviation safety upgradeFAA's Delhi visit raises hope of aviation safety upgrade
Aneesh Phadnis | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 12:41 PM IST
A US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) team is in Delhi to audit the Directorate General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA)  safety oversight mechanism.
In January, the FAA downgraded India's safety ranking to category II finding deficiencies in DGCA's safety oversight function and had imposed curbs on additional flights by Indian carriers to the US.
This has impacted Air India and Jet Airways, particularly the latter which is keen to add flights to Chicago and New York. Also US airlines have been restricted from code sharing with Indian carriers.
Air India earns about 18-20% revenue from India-US routes while Jet Airways about 5% of its revenue from its sole flight to Newark.
FAA team's Delhi visit a month before US president Barack Obama's India trip has led to buzz in aviation circles about a quick revision in India's ranking.
"The FAA team is checking DGCA's procedures regarding certification of airlines and charter companies. The audit is currently underway.  While India follows International Civil Aviation Organisation standards there were lacunae in procedures being followed in India. These processes have been streamlined and certification process has been revamped," said a civil aviation ministry official.
Vistara, the Tata-Singapore Airlines joint venture, is expected to receive its operating permit next week. The delay in the airline securing approval was being attributed to DGCA complying to FAA conditions.
FAA, in safety audits conducted in September and December last year, had expressed severe concerns over the lack of full-time flight operations inspectors (FOIs) in the DGCA and had subsequently downgraded India to category II of safety rankings, clubbing it with countries such as Zimbabwe and Indonesia. 
The DGCA, under its chief Prabhat Kumar, has been working overtime to fast-track processes and meet requirements pointed out by the FAA. 
DGCA has hired 56 FOIs and has roped in The Wicks Group (TWG) to enable India to regain category I status in safety rankings. 
TWG has former FAA officials on board and has previously helped countries like Azerbaijan, Cape Verde, Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine to upgrade their air safety rankings.

New Delhi: There was high drama in Lok Sabha with opposition MPs cornering the Narendra Modi government in Parliament over alleged forced conversion row for the second day in a row on Thursday. MPs were shouting slogans against the government and entered the well of the House.
The Bharatiya Janata party MPs were, however, unwary of the protest. Aligarh MP Satish Gautam said that such conversion event will happen in the city. He said, "We have been doing this for several years and will do it again on December 25. This isn't a conversion but 'ghar wapsi' (home coming)."
He, however, denied reports of luring people with below poverty line cards to convert people.

Another BJP leader Vinay Katiyar also stirred a controvery by saying, "Omar Abdullah's grandparents were Hindu, who later converted to Islam. There are several groups who convert people silently, why are you not asking them about it?" The remarks came after Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abullah had hit out at the BJP over alleged forced conversions in Agra.
The House witnessed similar uproar on Wednesday with opposition MPs demanding a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue. They said at least 100 Muslims were converted by an RSS offshoot by force and allurement, which was a criminal offence.
On the backfoot, the government had said the issue was a state subject and the Uttar Pradesh government was liable for it.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu assured the House of a discussion on the issue. "In this issue, we all have to work together. The government is more than willing but we should all work together. If the House wants, we can discuss it."
Bahujan Samaj party supremo Mayawati hit out at the BJP over the issue saying, "BJP and its groups want to create communal tension and riots in the shadow of conversion. The SP government should take strict action against groups who are trying to create such discord."
Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Agarwal said, "The Uttar Pradesh government is taking this issue seriously. An FIR has been lodged. Till the time we are in power, there will be no forced conversion."

Russia agrees to supply 12 nuclear reactors to India over 20 years

Nuclear reactors
(Russian President Vladimir…)
NEW DELHI: Russia will build at least 12 nuclear reactors in India by 2035 and agreed to manufacture advanced helicopters as both countries today signed 20 pacts in oil, gas, defence, investment and other key sectors to futher ramp up their strategic cooperation.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in their annual summit, vowed to take the close ties to a new level as both sides outlined a new vision for nuclear energy cooperation.
Calling Russia a "pillar of strength" for India, Modi, in a joint media interaction with Putin, said the strategic partner will remain New Delhi's "most important defence partner" though options have increased.
"President Putin and I discussed a broad range of new defence projects. We also discussed how to align our defence relations to India's own priorities, including Make in India.
"I am pleased that Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters. It includes the possibility of exports from India. It can be used for both military and civilian use. We will follow up on this quickly," Modi said after around three-and-half-hour long meeting with Putin.
Referring to cooperation in the nuclear sector, Modi said both sides have charted out an ambitious vision for nuclear energy of at least ten more reactors and noted that they will have the highest standards of safety in the world.
"It will also include manufacture of equipment and components in India. This also supports our Make in India policy," he said.
The strategic vision document on nuclear cooperation said the two Sides have decided to fast-track the implementation of agreed cooperation projects for nuclear power plants.
"Both Sides will strive to complete the construction and commissioning of not less than 12 units in the next two decades, in accordance with the Agreement of 2008.
The 20 agreements signed between the two countries provided for cooperation in a spectrum of areas including nuclear energy, oil and gas, health, investment, mining, media and wind power.
Terming the talks as "substantive", Putin said Russia will support "joint high technology" projects and will facilitate the establishment of an Indian operator of mobile communications besides offering India its civil aviation aircraft.

  On defence cooperation, Modi said a broad range of new defence projects were discussed that covered how to align "our defence relations to India's own priorities, including Make in India."
"I also proposed that Russia should locate manufacturing facilities in India for spares and components for Russian defence equipment in India. He responded very positively to my request," the Prime Minister said.
Noting that energy security was critical to India's economic development, Modi said both countries will set an ambitious agenda for partnership in oil and natural gas.
The pacts signed today include an agreement which provides for cooperation, covering joint exploration and production of hydrocarbons, long term LNG supplies and joint study of a hydrocarbon pipeline system connecting Russia with India.
Oil India Limited signed an MoU Russia's Zarubezhneft for cooperation in joint search and evaluation of new hydrocarbons exploration, production, and transportation projects.

Home Ministry seeks report from UP government on alleged forced conversions in Agra

New Delhi: The Home Ministry on Thursday sought report from the Uttar Pradesh government over alleged forced conversion in Agra. At least 100 persons from 37 families were reportedly re-converted to Hinduism at a ceremony organised by an offshoot of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the cantonment area.
The state government has registered an FIR against the RSS wing involved in conversions.
Meanwhile, there was high drama in Lok Sabha with opposition MPs cornering the Narendra Modi government in Parliament over alleged forced conversion row for the second day in a row. MPs were shouting slogans against the government and entered the well of the House.
#home ministry #uttar pradesh #uttar pradesh government #conversion row
The Bharatiya Janata party MPs were, however, unwary of the protest. Aligarh MP Satish Gautam said that such conversion event will happen in the city. He said, "We have been doing this for several years and will do it again on December 25. This isn't a conversion but 'ghar wapsi' (home coming)."
He, however, denied reports of luring people with below poverty line cards to convert people.
Another BJP leader Vinay Katiyar also stirred a controvery by saying, "Omar Abdullah's grandparents were Hindu, who later converted to Islam. There are several groups who convert people silently, why are you not asking them about it?" The remarks came after Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abullah had hit out at the BJP over alleged forced conversions in Agra.
The House witnessed similar uproar on Wednesday with opposition MPs demanding a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue. They said at least 100 Muslims were converted by an RSS offshoot by force and allurement, which was a criminal offence.
On the backfoot, the government had said the issue was a state subject and the Uttar Pradesh government was liable for it.

Kolkata: The Deputy Speaker of West Bengal Assembly and Trinamool leader Sonali Guha caught on tape threatening and manhandling residents of an apartment in Howrah.
This incident happened in the Golabari PS area of Howrah early on Thursday morning. The CCTV footage reveals that Guha called herself "the chief minister" and "the government" while threatening residents. Guha was accompanied by several Trinamool Congress activists and policemen when she raided the apartment in her government vehicle flashing beacon lights.
Guha threatened the president of building's residents' association of evicting him from his flat and locking it up over a non-functional elevator of the building. The 62-year victim, Dr Nagendra Rai, alleges he was also physically assaulted by the Trinamool supporters in the presence of policemen.
Trinamool leader Sonali Guha caught on tape threatening and manhandling residents of an apartment in Howrah.

Guha, an outsider to the building, allegedly raided the house on behalf of a resident party worker and wanted a 24-hour access to the elevator which remains shut at night as per an association resolution. Guha reportedly also threatened the victim of dire consequences if he filed a police complaint.
The victim has filed a complaint against Guha and 8 other TMC workers. Guha is a three-time MLA from Satgachhia seat in South 24 Parganas which was earlier a CPI-M stronghold and served as the cradle of Left patriarch Jyoti Basu who had won that seat five times in a row from 1977 to 1996.

Cabinet allows PSU banks to sell govt stake to raise capitalPSU banks allowed to raise up to Rs 1.60 lakh cr via govt stake sale
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 14:39 IST
The government on Wednesday allowed public sector banks to raise up to Rs 1.60 lakh crore (1.6 trillion) from markets by diluting government holding to 52 per cent in phases so as to meet Basel III capital adequacy norms.
"The quantum of capital support needed by banks is huge, which cannot be funded by budgetary support alone," an official statement said, detailing the decision taken by the Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to allow PSBs to raise equity capital from market.
The Cabinet asked the PSBs to broadbase retail shareholding while going in for the fund raising.
Out of 27 PSBs, government of India controls 22 through majority holding. In the remaining 5 banks, state-run SBI holds majority stake.
"If the PSBs are permitted to bring down government holding to 52 per cent in a phased manner, they can raise up to Rs 1,60,825 crore from the market," it said.
The Basel III norms, which will come into effect from March 31, 2019, were put in place following the 2007-08 financial crisis triggered by the fall of Lehman Brothers.
The norms are aimed at improving risk management and governance while raising the banking sector's ability to absorb financial and economic stress.
As per Basel-Ill norms, the minimum Tier-1 has to be 7 per cent.
The total support provided to PSBs towards capitalisation during the past four years was Rs 58,634 crore, the statement said, adding the provision for the current year is at Rs 11,200 crore.
The total market cap of government shareholding as on May 2014, stands at over Rs 4.19 lakh crore.
There are over two dozen PSBs and government holding in them is between 56.26 per cent to 88.63 per cent.
Public sector banks require equity capital of Rs 2.4 lakh crore by 2018 to meet Basel III norms.
GoI budgetary support needed for 2015-19 would be Rs 78,895 crore, which will maintain government holding at 52 per cent, the statement said.
However, as Government is likely to receive an amount of Rs 34,500 crore from PSBs as dividend, the net outgo will only be Rs 44,395 crore, it added.
"Going by past trends if we take average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate for the next five years as 6.5 percent and dividend pay-out ratio as 20 per cent as percentage of net profit or 0.80 of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and credit growth rate at 18 per cent and further RWAs growth at 16 per cent, the total capital would be over Rs 4.60 lakh crore," the statement said.

Govt open to detailed discussion in Parliament on conversion issue: NaiduGovt open to detailed discussion in Parliament on conversion issue: Naidu
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 02:15 PM IST
Government today said it is open to a detailed discussion in Parliament on the issue of alleged forced reconversion and if all parties agree it could even bring a legislation to ban conversions.
Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs M Venkaiah Naidu said that the NDA government is keen on discussing all issues.
"With regard to conversion and reconversion, if the Opposition wants to have a discussion, we are ready to have a detailed discussion in the House. We are also willing, if at all there is all party support, let there be a legislation also to ban conversion because this has been the wish of Mahatama Gandhi," he said.
"That being the case, let the Parliament of India discuss the issue threadbare and then come to a conclusion together. Let all the states and Centre together tackle this task about conversions and reconversions," the Minister said.
Hitting out at the Opposition, Naidu said it is not befitting for them to find an issue everyday to create "political hungama" to attack the government.
"If you are really sincere, give a notice, take permission from the Speaker and have a discussion," Naidu advised the Opposition parties. He reminded that Mahatama Gandhi had said proselytising is an enemy of the nation.
"If the House agrees, the government will have no problem in bringing an anti-conversion bill," he said.
BJP MP Kirti Azad said that there cannot be forceful conversions and in India people have been converting and reconverting for hundreds of years.
"The Uttar Pradesh Government should take action on it if anything wrong is going on. Why should it be made an issue to bring the nation to a standstill," he said.

Opposition creates uproar in Parliament over Agra  conversionsComments
The government offered to bring a law on religious conversion amid opposition pressure in Parliament on Thursday over the Agra controversy and tension in Aligarh and other sensitive areas where hard-line Hindu groups were aggressively pushing ahead their “reconversion” programmes.

“The government is ready to discuss and build a consensus on having a legislation on (religious) conversion,” parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said in the Lok Sabha after Opposition MPs shouted slogans demanding a debate and an adjournment motion on the Agra incident in which 57 poor Muslim families were apparently tricked to switch to Hinduism at a camp hosted by the Dharam Jagaran Samiti and the Bajrang Dal.
The Opposition also demanded an adjournment motion, saying incidents like the one in Agra could ignite riots. “They (organisers of religious conversions) are bringing the country a bad name and sowing seeds of poison,” said Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge.
When Parliament was debating the situation arising out of the Agra incident, an explosive letter surfaced in Agra in which Dharam Jagran Samiti leader Rajeshwer Singh has outlined the target, expenditure and achievement of his organisation to its cadre.
Setting a goal of 50 events this year to convert 100,000 Muslims and Christians, the letter seeks donations to go ahead with its proposed programmes, called ghar wapsi or homecoming ceremonies.
It calls for help from each volunteer to at least fund one event, saying Rs. 5 lakh is required to “reconvert” a Muslim while expenses on problems related to a Christian come to Rs. 2 lakh.
The letter says such ceremonies have “brought back” to Hinduism 40,000 people, including 2,000 Muslims, in 20 districts.
In communally-sensitive Aligarh, the Dharam Jagaran Samiti and the VHP announced their plan to “reconvert” 5,000 Christians and 1,000 Muslims at a function on Christmas.
They said Hindus would be appealed to welcome the “reconverted” Muslims and Christians, who had apparently switched faith from Hinduism some time in history.
Firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, who is the MP for Gorakhpur, and other senior leaders of RSS and VHP offshoots are likely to attend the programme to be held on a college campus.
The Hindu Yuva Vahini that Adityanath had floated, too, has a plan to convert over 2,000 people at a similar programme at Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh on December 18.
Muslim groups and political parties not aligned with the BJP demanded the governments at the Centre and the state to restrain the radical Hindu outfits .
Security in Aligarh was strengthened to prevent any violence. Senior superintendent of police J Ravindra Gaud promised swift action on any complaint of forced conversion.

Russia agrees with India to build 12 nuke reactorsPutin backs Make In India with copter, nuclear deals
Jayanth Jacob , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 11, 2014
First Published: 10:47 IST(11/12/2014) | Last Updated: 01:33 IST(12/12/2014)
Comments
Russia offered to help India set up at least 10 more nuclear reactors and manufacture light-utility helicopters  in line with the Make in India campaign as the two countries stepped up their defence and strategic partnership during President Vladimir Putin’s visit on Thursday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Russia would remain India’s most important defence partner and its “unique place in India’s foreign policy will not change” as he laid out a roadmap for stronger energy and business ties between New Delhi and Moscow at their 15th annual summit.
As India and Russia sought to strengthen a once-close relationship, the two countries signed 20 agreements including a contract to implement the third and fourth reactors of the Kudankulam nuclear power plant and a joint investment fund of $1 billion for Indian infrastructure and hydroelectric projects. Other strategic deals covered oil supply, infrastructure and an increase in direct diamond sales to India by Russian firm Alrosa.
Both nations team up to help Afghanistan, eradicate terrorism
“Even as India’s options have increased today, Russia will remain our most important defence partner,” Modi said after the summit. “Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters. It includes the possibility of exports from India. We will follow up on this quickly.”
HT was the first to report that Russia would join Modi’s first big-ticket ‘Make in India’ initiative in the defence sector.
The agreements reflected Russia’s need for allies in the face of Western sanctions over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Though India’s defence cooperation with other countries is expanding, 60% of defence purchases still come from Russia. However, India plans to bring down its dependence on foreign vendors and increase indigenisation of the defence sector as part of the Modi government’s Make in India initiative.
For the chopper deal, public sector unit Hindustan Aeronautics Limited or an Indian private firm could partner for the production of Kamov 226 T helicopters in India as bidding for these reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters is restricted for Indian firms and their joint ventures.
In the first phase, the order could be for 384 helicopters, which could subsequently be increased to 600 to replace the ailing Cheetah/Chetak fleet used by the Indian Army and air force.
The total cost of the project is expected to be over $3 billion.
Modi has also proposed that Russia should manufacture spares and components of Russian defence equipment, a request Putin responded to positively.
Like the defence sector, Russia also aligned nuclear cooperation with Make in India as the two leaders unveiled an ambitious nuclear energy plan to build at least 10 reactors. “It will also include manufacture of equipment and components in India. This also supports our Make in India policy,” Modi said. “Our partnership and the strong sensitivity that we have always had for each other’s interests will be a source of strength to both countries,” the Prime Minister said.
Putin said Russia could eventually supply India with 20 nuclear reactors.
“We highly appreciate the friendship, trust and mutual understanding with Indian partners,” said Putin.

LEED rated building space on the rise in India833 million sq ft building space in India LEED-rated, says US council

Hyderabad, December 11:  
US Green Building Council (USGBC) has announced that 833 million square feet of building space in India is using LEED certification rating and the momentum to go green is gathering pace.
LEED refers to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. The new study, ‘LEED in Motion: India’, was released on Thursday and details the impact that green buildings have had on the Indian economy and its buildings, homes and communities.
Contributing factors
The report provides an account of the factors that have led to nearly 2,000 buildings participating in the rating system in the Indian subcontinent. Mahesh Ramanujam, Chief Operating Officer, USGBC, said in a statement, “LEED’s success in India can be attributed to a number of factors, especially the widespread recognition by Indian business leaders and government officials that India’s rapid economic growth must be accompanied by a substantial investment in sustainable infrastructure.”
The LEED-rated buildings are cost effective and save money.
The rating is used in corporate offices, retail locations, software technology parks, hospitals, government buildings, factories, airports, hotels, homes and financial institutions across India to manage the performance of their buildings. And the rating system has been adopted by major Indian companies such as Infosys and ITC Limited.
These green buildings are designed and constructed as better buildings. The LEED-certified green buildings cost less to operate and reduce energy and water bills by as much as 40 per cent.
Cost-effective
The Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) located in Hyderabad has been instrumental in mobilising the green building movement in India and helping establish LEED as a key driver for market transformation.
USGBC and IGBC continue their collaboration in advancing the uptake of green buildings in India.

Paris, Dec 11:  
European shares fell in early trading on Thursday, losing ground for the fourth session in a row, as this week’s slump in oil and iron ore prices weighed on a number of resource-related stocks.
Shares in Airbus fell as much as 4.5 per cent, adding to a 10 per cent drop in the previous session after the planemaker predicted flat profits in 2016. That surprised investors who had expected new and recently upgraded models to start boosting results that year.
Analysts also cited rising concerns that tumbling oil prices will reduce airlines’ incentive to buy new, more fuel efficient aircraft.
“Further downside risks to A330 production rates/pricing and worries over the impact of low oil prices on aircraft replacement demand could potentially weigh on market sentiment,’’ Citi analysts wrote in a note.
Zara owner Inditex bucked the trend, gaining 3.1 per cent after posting in-line earnings.
At 0920 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares was down 0.1 per cent at 1,356.47 points. The index has lost 3.5 per cent so far this week.
Major losers
Oil services stocks featured among the biggest losers, with Seadrill down 0.9 per cent and PGS down 1 per cent.
Brent crude has plummeted more than 40 per cent since June, forcing a number of oil services companies to scrap dividends as oil majors accelerate cost-cutting efforts.
The STOXX oil and gas index has tumbled 27 per cent since June. The sell-off has wiped $280 billion off market capitalisation of the sector, nearly the size of Israel's GDP.
Shares in CGG tumbled 9.3 per cent on Thursday after a media report saying the French government has doubts about a potential tie-up with rival Technip. Technip shares gained 2.8 per cent.
ECB loan offer to banks
Investors awaited the results of the European Central Bank’s loan offer to banks, expected around 1015 GMT. The ECB is offering banks cheap, four-year loans as part of a package of measures to add around 1 trillion euros to the ECB’s balance sheet in a bid to pump money into the economy and stave off the threat of deflation.
According to a Reuters poll, banks are seen taking 130 billion euros. They borrowed £82.6 billion in a first tranche in September and can take up to £400 billion in both rounds combined.
“If the take-up is disappointing, there could be various reactions on stock indexes: a drop on the news, followed by a rebound as the disappointing news would spark hopes to see quantitative easing being launched in Europe earlier than what is currently expected,’’ said John Plassard, senior sales trader at Mirabaud Securities, in Geneva.

London, Dec 11:  
Britain’s top share index edged higher on Thursday, after a three-session losing streak pushed it to its lowest levels in over a month, with major oil firms picking up after a sell-off.
The FTSE 100 was up 18.81 points, or 0.3 per cent, at 6,518.86 by 0835 GMT after setting its lowest close since November 4 on Wednesday.
The index had fallen 3.6 per cent in the first three sessions of this week, hit in part by a slumping oil price, which knocked heavily-weighted energy stocks.
Brent crude ticked higher on Thursday, lifting oil and gas shares, although it remained below $65 per barrel, not far from the previous session’s five-year low.
A global glut and weak data from China have put renewed pressure on oil prices this week.
Tullow Oil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP were 1.7-2 per cent higher.
Mid-cap energy services firm John Wood Group rose 3.6 per cent after it said it had secured a $750-million, five-year contract from BP, and said earnings would be in line with expectations.
The energy services sector has been hit by concerns that such contracts could dry up as oil majors cut back further on capital expenditure in the face of a weak oil price. Blue chip peer Petrofac rose 1.7 per cent.
“Wood Group is a solid company and their message today is encouraging,’’ Mark Ward, head of execution trading at Sanlam Securities, said.
“I think they are still undervalued here; they are still nearly 250 pence from their mid-year highs back in June. Clearly the weak oil price will be an ongoing concern, but they are a strong company who can ride out the volatility.’’
Oil and gas-related stocks were the best performers, adding 14.5 points to the FTSE index.
Elsewhere, insurer Legal & General rose 1.1 per cent, with traders citing an upgrade to “buy’’ from “neutral’’ by Nomura as being behind the move.
Aberdeen Asset Management, 3I Group and Babcock were 1-2.4 per cent lower as they traded without entitlement to their latest dividend payouts.

Quadrasystems accelerates adoption of latest IT tools amongst SMBsQuadrasystems accelerates adoption of latest IT tools amongst SMBs
L N Revathy

Coimbatore, Dec 11:  
Technology is the differentiator and for businesses today, cloud is the great leveller, asserted S Prashanth, Executive Director, Quadrasystems.
Throwing light on how technology is changing the way in which traditional businesses are run, Prashanth cited the example of Whatsapp, the mobile messenger application.
Urging SMBs to adopt technology instead of looking at it (technology adoption) as a cost centre, he said “cloud computing is driving modern businesses as 43 per cent of SMB employees work in more than one location and 55 per cent of such businesses support mobile workforce. These people will therefore need to collaborate and get work done more efficiently.”
“Businesses need elasticity and scalability and be on par with their competitors globally. A connected workforce can react in real time and cloud is the great leveller,” reiterated the ED of Quadrasystem
Quadrasystems incidentally, is a Microsoft Gold Competency partner with 31 global awards.
The company has registered a 33 per cent year-on-year growth in its cloud business owing to rapid cloud adoption by business. Quadrasystems has added more than 40,000 users on the cloud over the past twelve months, Prasanth said, adding “there is still huge potential to grow, considering that Coimbatore is home to more than 75,000 MSMEs with an approximate investment of Rs 15,000 cr.”
Microsoft's Azure and Office365, which are available via open licensing is adding significant value, because users have the flexibility to plan, purchase, deploy and manage their IT roadmap with the help of Microsoft's partners across the country, he said.
Sharing details on how technology adoption propels business growth, he said “studies show that tech-savvy SMBs are six times more likely to have international customers, two times more effective in meeting the changing needs and the resultant benefit included higher revenues, profits and better position in the global market place.''
Hailing Quadra's efforts in driving cloud awareness in upcoming markets, the Director of Microsoft India Sudhir Nayar said that the company is working closely with the Quadra team to help translate cloud offerings for specific industry verticals. “If more SMBs adopted the latest IT tools, there is potential for the SMEs to grow their revenue by $56 billion and create 1.1 million new jobs,” Nayar said.

Snapdeal acquires gift recommendation firm WishpickerSnapdeal acquires gift recommendation firm Wishpicker
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 20:31 IST
Snapdeal has acquired in its first acquisition after $627-million Softbank fund infusion, has acquired Wishpicker, an online gift retailer founded by IIT-Delhi graduates.
The acquisition amount for the company, founded last year by IITians Apurv Bansal and Prateek Rathore, was not disclosed.
"We are investing in strengthening our technology platform and Wishpicker.com is an excellent platform with top-tier entrepreneurial, engineering talent and fits in perfectly with our vision," Snapdeal Co-Founder Rohit Bansal said in a statement.
Wishpicker claims to provide gift ideas from across the internet through intelligent gift recommendation engine. It uses parameters like relationship with the recipient, age and personality for suggesting gifts.
Bansal said that as consumer buying trends are evolving, intelligent recommendations will be one of the key drivers for business volume for sellers.
This is the fifth acquisition by the e-commerce company since inception.
Snapdeal had said it would use the investments from Softbank to expand its chain of fulfilment centres and make acquisitions in the coming few months, specifically in the area of mobile technology.
The online marketplace had earlier acquired Bangalore-based group buying site Grabbon.com (June 2010), esportsbuy.com (April 2012), Shopo.in (May 2013) and Doozton (April 2014).
"This is an important acquisition for us in terms of adding new technology capabilities and helping sellers connect with buyers in newer ways," Bansal said.
Co-founder Kunal Bahl had told PTI earlier: "Snapdeal is looking at acquisition opportunities across sizes, ranging from less than $1 million to $100 million."
With over 30 million members and more than 50,000 sellers, Snapdeal.com delivers products to 5,000 cities and towns in India. It has received funding from several global marquee investors like Softbank, BlackRock, Temasek, eBay, Premji Invest, Intel Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Ratan Tata, Nexus Venture Partners and Kalaari Capital among others.

Corning claims Gorilla Glass 4 twice as tough as any other glass inmarkerWritten by Nandagopal Rajan |
Posted: December 11, 2014 3:45 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 3:48 pm
Corning Incorporated on Thursday announced the introduction of Corning Gorilla Glass 4 to India’s consumer electronics market. Corning claims its product is up to two times tougher than any competitive cover glass design now in the market.
Amit Bansal, president, Corning Technologies, India, said the company was is constant touch with Indian OEMs to understand their requirements. “It is one of the fastest growing consumer electronics markets in the world and it therefore makes perfect sense to equip manufactures here with the very best in cover glass technology,” he added.
James Hollis, director, Sales and Engineering, Gorilla Glass, Specialty Materials  said the Corning Glass 4 had significantly improved damage resistance. He claimed it out performs all existing glass for sharp contact damage.
Hollis said their data showed that most damage was caused to glass by drops on asphalt and not smooth surfaces.
The company claims Gorilla Glass 4 survives up to 80% of the time Soda-lime glass, as deployed in today’s commercial devices, breaks nearly 100% of the time. Gorilla Glass 4 is manufactured using Corning’s proprietary fusion draw process and maintains the thinness, durability, and optical clarity.

Ban on conversion an infringement of fundamental right:CongressBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 3:38 pm
Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Thursday slammed the government for suggesting that a legislation to ban religious conversions can be brought in if all parties agree, saying it was an infringement of fundamental rights.
The Congress general secretary said it would be improper to ban conversion if any individual wanted to willfully convert to another religion.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said the NDA Government is open to a detailed discussion in the Parliament on the issue of conversion and if all parties agree it could even bring a legislation to ban conversions.
“Can Mr Naidu stop anyone from converting willingly to any other religion. It will be an infringement of fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution. It is the fundamental right of an individual to choose his/her religion.
“However, by giving any benefit and luring anyone to change religion is a crime and it should remain so,” Singh told reporters outside Parliament.
The Congress leader also asked the Samajwadi Party-led Government in Uttar Pradesh to register an FIR against those involved in forcible reconversions in Agra.
“The SP is in power in Uttar Pradesh. It should register an FIR and make arrests of those involved (in reconversions).
“We are all waiting to see how much courage does Akhilesh Yadav ji have…how many people does he arrest and how much strictness he brings in,” Singh said.
The AICC general secretary alleged it was a “political strategy” of the RSS and the BJP to spread political tensions by organising such events, which have helped them reap political benefits.

Uma Bharti slams opposition for not letting her speak on GangarejuvenationBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 3:38 pm
Union Minister Uma Bharti on Thursday slammed the opposition for not allowing her to speak in Lok Sabha on the issue of rejuvenation of Ganga and give details of the project due to disruptions in the House over alleged forced re-conversion in Agra.
The Minister for Water Resources River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation also accused the opposition of doing “nothing” on the issue for 10 years.
“There was an important question today, which I had been raising with the members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for the last two years and had brought them on the same page.
“When the issue of Ganga was raised, the Speaker was saying that this issue is related to Ganga and let her (Bharti) speak. If a bill on Ganga was to be introduced, it would have got passed without an opposition,” Bharti said.
The Minister was speaking to reporters outside the Parliament.
She, however, declined to give details of the project on the pretext that the question was yet to be answered before the House.
Attacking the Opposition over the issue, Bharti said, “The previous government did nothing on Ganga. The Prime Minister has acted so fast on the issue. Never has there been a case in the world that any Prime Minister constituted a ministry and it started functioning smoothly in six months. I wanted to give a brief of this in the Parliament.
“Even on the issue of Ganga, the opposition did not allow any discussion to take place,” she said.
When asked about the on-going row on religious re-conversion in Agra, she dodged the question saying that the matter is “beyond her purview to comment on.”

China boosts bank liquidity with $65 bn fund...China boosts bank liquidity with $65 billion fund injection

(The latest fund injection…)
SHANGHAI: China's central bank has stepped up its efforts to pump more cash into its banking system with a $65 billion fund injection, Dow Jones Newswires reported Thursday.
The People's Bank of China (PBoC) on Wednesday injected around 400 billion yuan into the interbank market where banks borrow from each other, Dow said, citing people familiar with the matter.
It came after an earlier 500 billion yuan injection into the country's five biggest state-owned banks in September through a tool to manage short-term liquidity, according to state-run media. The loans were set to expire this month.
The latest fund injection has not been made public by the PBoC for fear that the market might read it as a strong signal of a broad monetary easing, Dow cited the sources as saying.
China's central bank has repeatedly said it will maintain a "prudent" monetary policy , though it resorted to so-called "targeted" cuts in the amount of money some banks must put aside to encourage lending, and cut interest rates in a surprise move in late November.
But some large Chinese banks are pressing for more, seeking an overall cut in the their reserve requirement ratios (RRR), Dow reported Monday citing unnamed sources.
Analysts have foreseen more RRR cuts to replace the "covert" fund injections to boost the economy.

WTO rules in Indias favour in steel dispute with USWTO rules in India’s favour in steel dispute with US
PTI
The US had imposed the higher duties on steel imports from India arguing that some domestic companies were being indirectly subsidised by the Indian government.
Geneva/New Delhi, Dec 9:  
In a major relief to the steel industry, the WTO has ruled against the US which had imposed high duty on imports of certain steel products from India.
The Appellate Body of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has ruled that the duty imposed by the US on the Indian steel products is “inconsistent” with its Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.
However, it also rejected some of the findings of the Geneva-based organisation’s dispute settlement panel which were in India’s favour.
The body has also recommended that the US should modify its norms and bring them in line with the WTO’s agreement.
After India filed its complaint at the WTO in 2012, the dispute settlement panel of the body in July this year had ruled in India’s favour against the USA’s imposition of higher duties on New Delhi’s steel imports.
A member country can challenge panel’s ruling and approach Appellate Body of the WTO.
The US Department of Commerce (USDOC) had imposed countervailing duty (CVD) on India’s exports of hot-rolled carbon steel flat products.
According to reports, Washington has imposed duties of about 300 per cent on these product imports.
The US had imposed the higher duties on steel imports from India arguing that some domestic companies were being indirectly subsidised by the Indian government.

Cadila launches first cheaper copy of worlds top-selling drugcompany information
The company will launch its version under the name Exemptia
Cadila Healthcare said on Tuesday it launched the first biosimilar version of anti-inflammatory medicine adalimumab, the world’s top-selling drug, at a fifth of its U.S. price.
The drug’s branded version is sold under the name Humira by U.S. firm AbbVie Inc, and costs $1,000 for a vial in the United States. Humira had sales of $3.26 billion in the quarter ended September, accounting for 65 per cent of AbbVie’s total revenue.
A price of $200 a vial would still keep the drug out of reach for most people in India, where more than 70 per cent of the population lives on less than $2 a day and health insurance is scarce.
Biosimilars are cheaper copies of biotech drugs — medicines made from proteins and other large molecules.
Cadila expects sales of between Rs.100 crore ($16.16 million) and Rs.200 crore from its biosimilar of Humira in the domestic market, Deputy Managing Director Sharvil Patel told Reuters.
The company will launch its version under the name Exemptia for treating diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.
About 12 million people in India suffer from these disorders, Cadila said in a statement.
“We are working towards being among the first wave of the launch of this drug’s biosimilars globally,’’ Mr. Patel said, adding that he did not expect any domestic competition on the drug ‘in short-term’.
The company expected to launch the medicine in the United States in 2019, he said.
Humira’s U.S. patent will expire in late 2016 and AbbVie has said it will take years for other drugmakers to develop and win approval for their own generic versions.
Cadila had meetings scheduled with the U.S. and Europe regulators next year, Mr. Patel said. “It’s an attractive market, there are many, many companies working on this product.’’
Biosimilars are expected to account for about one quarter of the $100-billion worth of sales stemming from off-patent biological drugs by the end of the decade, a study compiled by Thomson Reuters BioWorld said in September.
Several hundred companies around the world are chasing the biosimilars market, including Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Cipla and Lupin.

DIPP to move Cabinet on merging FDI  FPI limits into a composite capWritten by Shruti Srivastava | New Delhi |
Posted: December 10, 2014 1:03 am | Updated: December 10, 2014 6:31 am
The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) is giving final touch to the proposal of merging the limits of foreign direct and portfolio investments into, what is being called, a composite cap.
A senior official told The Indian Express that the work on having “composite caps across the sectors is almost finished. The Cabinet note on the same will soon be circulated for approval”.
The proposal is essentially a move towards giving companies more flexibility for deciding on the mix of foreign investment they want. Further, it will also bring in transparency and clarity on the foreign investment policy of the country at a time when the BJP-led government is trying hard to woo foreign investors to jump-start the economic revival.
“It is a matter of having clarity on the policy. Currently there is an anomaly as the principle is being applied in some select cases. The composite cap will bring in uniformity,” Akash Gupt, ED, PwC, said.
Overseas investments up to 49 per cent via automatic route will be allowed through foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign institutional investors (FIIs), foreign venture capital investment (FVCI), foreign portfolio investment (FPI), non-resident Indian investment, foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCB), fully and mandatorily convertible debentures or preference shares and depository receipts.
However, for FII investments above 24 per cent in sensitive sectors like defence, approval by the government would be needed, the official said.
The government has already allowed foreign investment, comprising FDI, FIIs, NRIs, FVCIs and qualified foreign investors (QFIs), up to 49 per cent in the defence sector and proposes to raise the same up to 49 per cent in the insurance sector too.
The draft report on Insurance Bill raising the cap from the current 26 per cent to 49 per cent has already been adopted by the Parliamentary select committee and is likely to be tabled in Parliament in the ongoing Winter session.
Opposition parties including the Congress and the Left have been against the proposal on the grounds that portfolio investment is “hot money, and very short-term in nature”. Senior leaders of the Opposition have argued that allowing such composite cap will always raise concern as this may leave the country any time without any actual addition to the country’s wealth.
Earlier during the year, a government panel headed by ex-economic affairs secretary Arvind Mayaram had suggested easing foreign investment rules and doing away with separate caps on FIIs and FDI to move towards a composite cap structure.
The committee had recommended 49 per cent foreign investment through the automatic route in all sectors except defence, insurance and media. It had pegged FPI limit at 24 per cent through automatic route.

McDonald's exec hopes to increase digital staff from about 20 to as many as 250.
McDonald's is opening an office in Chicago's River North neighborhood, primarily to house digital employees, a senior executive said Tuesday night.

Plans call for the office to be open by the end of the first quarter, Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's senior executive vice president and global chief brand officer said during an appearance as part of an AKTA innovation chat series. The location of the office was not disclosed.
The Oak Brook-based burger giant opened a similar office in the San Francisco area in May, he said.
McDonald's prolonged sales slump is taking a bite out of profitability at its restaurants, the world's largest restaurant chain said Monday, pushing its shares down more than 3 percent. ( Jessica Wohl )
There are about 20 employees on the company's U.S. digital team. He said he expects to have 200 to 250 such employees globally by the end of 2015.
On Wednesday, McDonald's CEO Don Thompson will speak to investors along with Mike Andres, who returned to McDonald's in October to run the company's U.S operations. The company has posted six consecutive months of declining same-store sales around the world. To help reverse the slump, McDonald's has been ramping up efforts such as mobile payments and other digital efforts.

Offshore Debt Markets Attractive to Indian Corporates: FitchTata Motors Sales Rise 10% in December
New Delhi: Rating agency Fitch today said it expects Indian corporates to increasingly access offshore debt markets to meet their funding requirements.
The offshore bond issuances by non-financial Indian corporates is estimated to have crossed $13 billion so far in 2014 as against around $9 billion in 2013.
"The offshore capital markets are increasingly attractive to Indian corporates partly because of better pricing for their bonds," Fitch Ratings said in a statement.
The growth in access to bond market is likely to be driven by the need to refinance debt and fund capex once the investment cycle restarts, it added.
The offshore markets now present a relatively more cost-effective funding source as compared with onshore funding for Indian corporates, it said.
Also the reduction of withholding tax on interest payments of offshore bonds to 5 per cent with effect from July 2014, compared with 20 per cent earlier, has incentivized investment in such instruments.
"Investor demand for Indian bonds has also been strong due to expectations of improvement in Indian economic growth, improved political stability and strong liquidity in global capital markets," Fitch added.

A still from “The Householder” starring Leela Naidu and Shashi Kapoor
Ruth Prawer Jhabvala
Hindi cinema
Ruth Prawer Jhabvala’s works are still relevant
Three domes clearly in need of a whitewash and a bit of repair. Some roofs which have probably not been visited for a while. A man sleeps on a coir cot, his wife sits close by. It is not quite dawn yet. The muezzin calls out for prayer: “Assalato khairum minanar” (Prayer is preferable over sleep). The little prayer at the beginning of the James Ivory-directed film The Householder set the tone for rest of the proceedings at India International Centre in New Delhi where the connoisseurs of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala are paying their tribute to her with a slew of films. The films, starting with The Householder and on to Mr and Mrs Bridge and The Golden Bowl, etc, form part of a retrospective celebrating Ruth, distinguished author and screenplay writer who remains the only writer to win both a Booker Award for her novel Heat and Dust, as well as two Academy Awards for her adaptation of E.M. Forster’s novels, A Room with a View and Howards End.
Incidentally, The Householder was the first cinematic association of Ruth with Ismail Merchant and James Ivory. Made in 1963, it set in stone Ruth’s bond with films. Interestingly, Ruth initially was not enthused by the idea of a film on her book. Even less so with the choice of the so-glamorous Shashi Kapoor as the lead. A self-effacing writer who brooked no disturbance while she wrote, from nine in the morning to around 1.30 in the afternoon, Ruth finally agreed to the choice made by producer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory. It was a choice she lived to love: films like A Room with a View, Heat and Dust, Shakespeare Wallah, Bombay Talkie came about due to this association. It all began with The Householder which was, interestingly, the first time Ivory and Merchant came together too. The film, a black and white saga, also starring Leela Naidu, Asha Sharma, Achla Sachdev, Pahadi Sanyal and Durga Khote, was shot largely in and around Delhi.
The film narrates the story of a newly married man with an independent wife. They live under the same roof but share very little with each other. Both take recourse to nostalgia. He seeks help too; from his fellow teachers in college, his mother who does not quite know how to let go of her son, and others. Without realising it, the man’s life becomes a prayer, a constant search for a better tomorrow. With symbols and silence, the film progresses. And it is only after a while that one realises the importance of the call for prayer at the beginning.
As I step out of the hall after taking in the film which is around a hundred minutes, the dawn is still way off. Yet the film has done its bit in throwing light on Ruth all over again. A shade over 50 years after she did her first screenplay, Ruth’s work continues to engage, evoke, even provoke. She deserves attention. The ongoing retrospective at IIC will, hopefully, go some way in filling the vacuum.

BSE Sensex extends losses on global cues  down 87 ptsStreet sees good show after stellar year
Continuing its falling streak for the fourth straight day, the benchmark BSE Sensex fell by nearly 87 points in early trade today on sustained selling by funds and investors amid weak global cues.
The 30-share barometer, which lost 765.81 points in the previous three sessions, fell by 86.98 points, or 0.31 per cent, to 27,710.03 in early trade.
On similar lines, the National Stock Exchange index Nifty declined by 9 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 8,331.70.
Brokers said apart from weak global cues following tougher Chinese rules on lending and political instability in Greece, capital outflows by foreign funds and selling by retail investors dampened trading sentiment here.
Stocks of FMCG, auto, consumer durables, capital goods and oil & gas sectors were leading the fall.
Among other Asian markets, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.18 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei moved down by 1.07 per cent in early trade.
The US Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.29 per cent lower in yesterday’s trade.

Zuari group firms to reclassify sharesStreet sees good show after stellar year
Saroj Poddar-led Adventz Group’s Zuari Agro Chemicals and Zuari Global on Tuesday said four companies namely SIL Investmemts, RTM Investment and Trading Company, SCM Investment and Trading Company and Ronson Traders have ceased to be the promoters of them with immediate effect.
These four companies have decided to obtain reclassification of shares they held in both Zuari Agro Chemicals and Zuari global from “promoter category” to “public category”, the two Zuari group firms said in separate BSE filings.
The four companies collectively owned 8.12% in Zuari Agro Chemical and now after the reclassification their shares may be considered as a part of the free-float. The reason for reclassification was, however, not mentioned in the filings. As the four companies ceased to be the promoters of Zuari Agro Chemicals and Zuari Global, public shareholdings of both the companies have increased from the earlier levels.
For Zuari Agro Chemicals its public shareholding now increased to 34.71%. As on September 30, 2014 it stood at 26.59%.
Interestingly, Zuari Agro Chemicals was person acting in concert (PAC) with Zuari Fertlisers and Chemicals, the acquirer, for the recently launched fresh open offer by Poddar for an additional 25.90% equity of Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilisers (MCF).
The four companies, SIL Investmemts, RTM Investment, SCM Investment and Ronson Traders, were mentioned as the PAC of Zuari Agro for the open offer.

Oils well for paint  fertiliser stocksStreet sees good show after stellar year
Although oil marketers and automobile companies that offer entry-level cars are seen as direct beneficiaries of falling crude oil prices, companies from the chemical, fertilisers and paint industries are also likely to gain indirectly through lower raw material costs.
It is not surprising then that many stocks from these sectors have rallied 50-90% this year with a substantial portion of gains coming in the last six months during which benchmark crude oil prices have dropped more than 40%.
Amid concerns of oversupply, as global Brent crude oil prices nosedive to their lowest in five years ($66.29 per barrel for Brent), companies that use raw materials derived from crude oil and petroleum products could see an expansion to their operating margins.
Click here for graph
Indeed, the trend in operating margins for some of these companies for which crude oil and its derivatives like LNG, fuel oil, suplhur, waxes, petroleum coke, benzene, solvents or emulsifiers account for a substantial portion of raw material costs have expanded in the last six months.
A comparison with the margins of fiscal 2013-14 shows that fertilisers and paint companies have started reflecting the comfort of lower crude oil prices with the expansion in profitability. Operating margins of National Fertilizer, Tata Chemicals, Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals and Kansai Nerolac have grown anywhere between 200 and 400 bps for the first half of FY15 compared to FY14.
However, not all companies have managed to maintain the price momentum, given that the stocks of Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers and Chemicals, Gujarat Alkalies and National Fertilisers have factored in a slowdown in revenue growth of these companies in the first half of this fiscal and lost 8-18% in the last six months when the fall in crude oil prices intensified.
Analysts have also turned upbeat on stocks like GSFC and Tata Chemicals due to company-specific developments like a turnaround in chemicals business, expectations of strong margins in the fertiliser segments for the former and strong performance of domestic business and a restructuring of overseas business for the latter.
However, some analysts are getting wary of the valuations at which most of the paint companies and some fertiliser companies like GSFC are trading, as they believe that the benefits of lower crude oil prices may already have been factored in gains of more than 30% recorded by these stocks in the last six months. The 30-share Sensex has added 11% in the period, taking its year-to-date rally to 32%.

Why China really leads IndiaRahul Jacob: Why China really leads India
Rahul Jacob |  Dec 10, 2014 09:44 PM IST
Last week, a projection of gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates by Goldman Sachs that showed India's pace of economic growth might soon surpass China's prompted a flurry of news stories. The real story is how far behind India is - China's GDP is about $9 trillion while India's is $1.8 trillion. Even slower growth for China off such a high base will keep China ahead of India for another century or two.
In a recent paper, the economists Larry Summers and Lant Pritchett project what the gains to the global economy would be if China and India continued to grow at their current pace. Before pointing out that even fast-growing developing countries see growth eventually slow to something closer to the global mean, they calculate faster growth would mean a net gain of $56 trillion by 2033 for global GDP with China's share of that additional growth amounting to a staggering $51 trillion and India's $5 trillion.
This is a theoretical exercise since it is highly unlikely China can grow at the torrid pace it has for the past couple of decades. Nevertheless, the numbers underline the advantage of having such a gigantic base to grow off.
There are many reasons why India will never catch up with China - but least commented upon among them is a similarly enormous lead in gender equality for China. As a recent Save the Children report observes, India ranked 132nd on a gender inequality index put out by the United Nations Development Programme behind even Pakistan and Bangladesh, not to mention Sri Lanka at 75. The Gender Inequality Index measures yardsticks like the number of births to women still in their teens, the number of women with secondary level education to the proportion of women who are part of the workforce to the numbers of women in Parliament. China is some 100 places ahead of India.
The report, The World of India's Girls, offers a depressing vision of what it means to grow up as a girl in India. For starters, female foeticide is "most prevalent" among the richest sections of society. A quarter of girls never make it past Class V and 41 per cent don't complete Class VIII. About half of India's girls are married by the time they are 18. "Concern for safety of girls is one of the chief reasons girls are married off early," the report says. The number of women teachers, who would ordinarily be role models, has fallen from 38 per cent in 2001 to 31 per cent in 2012.
There is lots more - the evidence that girls struggle to survive beyond the age of five, the 38 million "missing women" in India, the largest share in the world. The report interviews 11-15-year-old girls in slums in Delhi who aspire to being policewomen, in large part because they see violence towards women and harassment as part of the fabric of their lives. Older girls matter-of-factly observe that even if they do better at studies than their brothers they are more likely to be pulled out of school. But the most disturbing of all is reading teenaged boys echo the prejudices of their parents. "Girls should not be allowed to use a mobile phone," says a boy in his late teens in Odisha. "Girls use mobile phones to talk to boys and it is hard for their parents to know who they are talking to."
Taking a break from such irritating double standards, I turned to Factory Girls, Leslie Chang's account of migrant women working in China's busiest factories in the south. In the early 2000s, women accounted for 70 per cent of the factory workforce there. China's is a tale of female emancipation and upward mobility on a mass scale. The women workers were not afraid of the police, Ms Chang found - they were not afraid of much really. "Almost all the senior people I met in factories had started on the assembly line," writes Ms Chang. "The young women I knew did not appear destined to return to the farm because they had never farmed before."
Among my most vivid recollections of reporting in southern Chinese cities like Shenzhen and Dongguan between 2010 and 2013 is of city centres teeming with unaccompanied young women out often till 11 p m to midnight after a day's work - shopping at street markets and eating at hotpot restaurants and laughing raucously. (In New Delhi, even in the parts dotted with ministers' gigantic compounds, it is hard to find unaccompanied women on the street after 9 p m.) I recall human resources managers in China complaining that as women discovered more opportunities in retail and restaurants, their companies were struggling to recruit as many women as they wanted. (The ratio of men and women in factories had by then fallen to about 50-50.) The contrast between China's quasi-developed world status and India's is very large, but nowhere more so than in how women conduct their lives, the glaring imbalance in sex ratios in both countries notwithstanding.
The rape last Friday of a woman coming home from an early night of socialising is a reminder of how far we have to go. The banning of web-based taxi-hailing services is a substitute for thoughtful action by our patriarchal governing classes because they are likely unaware that middle- and upper middle-class women felt liberated to have services like Uber and Ola at their fingertips. And how seriously does the government take safety for women on public transport, anyway? One of the smallest sums doled out in the Budget earlier this year was the outlay for the safety of women on public transport. The much heralded programme of girls' emancipation (Beti Bachao) received Rs 100 crore, about the same as the money allocated to a sports university in Manipur. Of course, there are countries in the world that treat women worse than we do, but at least they don't pretend they will one day catch up with China.

Foreign Inflows to Halve to $20 Billion in 2015: Credit SuisseL&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
Mumbai: Swiss brokerage Credit Suisse on Wednesday said robust foreign inflows into India's debt and equities markets will halve to $18-20 billion next year on a slowdown in the sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) play.
"The FII (foreign institutional investors) inflows into the domestic markets will come down to $18-20 billion in the next 12 months, which is half of the current inflows," Neelkanth Mishra, managing director for equity research at Credit Suisse, told reporters here.
He attributed this primarily to a possible slowdown in pumping in money by the SWFs.
SWFs are short on allocable resources due to the fall in the crude oil prices, Mr Mishra said.
FIIs hold as much as 27 per cent in the over $1.6 trillion Sensex market capitalisation as of the September quarter, which is at a historic high.
Currently, the inflows are almost evenly split between debt and equities, (as there is a $25 billion cap on FIIs' holdings in government bonds, though there is a huge demand for more) and Mishra pointed to his in-house research which said around 40-50 per cent of the inflows into domestic equities come from SWFs.
It can be noted that oil prices have slid to a five-year low of $66-67 to a barrel. Since June, there has been a massive 35 per cent fall in the Indian basket of Brent crude.
Many of the countries in the Middle East like the UAE and Oman have very active SWFs.
Even though the policymakers sometimes blame such flows to be "fickle", the FII inflows are important for funding the current account gap and reducing the overall deficit, which surged up to 2.1 per cent in the second quarter as against 1.2 per cent a year-ago.
When asked about flows from pension funds and insurance companies, Mr Mishra acknowledged they are getting interested in domestic markets, saying they spend a lot of time in due diligence before taking an investment call.
They move slowly and there will not be a dramatic uptick in their interest over the span of a single year, he said.
He also said he expects returns of 30 per cent from the equity markets over the next two years or 15 per cent per annum growth, but did not give a target level for the indices.
It can be noted that the Sensex has been the second best performer YTD (year to date) across the globe with a 35 per cent rally after the Shanghai index which jumped 47 per cent. And many analysts are commenting that Chinese stocks, due to cheaper valuation may spoil the Sensex party next year.
Many foreign brokerages have given a very promising year for the Sensex with some of them seeing it at 33,000 at the end of next December.
Mr Mishra said GDP growth will be handsome and the country will be one of the few pockets which will show good numbers, as the world is expected to struggle on the growth front.
He said he does not expect the RBI to deliver a rate cut before March, as inflation may go up in January and its Governor Raghuram Rajan wants to conclusively see a downward trend in the trajectory before he starts cutting the rates.

India may clock 6.3% growth in 2016: UN reportIndian economy may clock 6.3% growth in 2016: UN report
Yoshita Singh     United Nations    Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 10:48 IST
India's economic growth is expected to improve to 6.3 per cent in 2016 with the country leading economic recovery in South Asia, according to a United Nations report.
The UN World Economic Situation and Prospects 2015 (WESP) report, launched  on Wednesday,  also said India is likely to make progress in implementing economic policy reforms and help provide support to business and consumer confidence.
It said global economic growth is forecast to continue increasing over the next two years, despite legacies from the financial crisis continuing to weigh on growth, and the emergence of new challenges, including geopolitical conflicts such as in Ukraine, and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
The global economy is expected to grow 3.1 per cent in 2015 and 3.3 per cent in 2016, compared with an estimated growth of 2.6 per cent for 2014, when the pace of expansion has been moderate and uneven.
It said India, which is estimated to record a 5.4 per cent economic growth in 2014, will see GDP growth improving to 5.9 per cent next year and 6.3 per cent in 2016.
Economic growth in South Asia is also set to gradually pick up from an estimated 4.9 per cent in 2014 to 5.4 per cent in 2015 and 5.7 per cent in 2016.
"While the recovery will be led by India, which accounts for about 70 per cent of regional output, other economies such as Bangladesh and Iran are also projected to see stronger growth in the forecast period," the report said.
The about six per cent growth projected for India in 2016 will be the highest since the 2008-2011 period when it had grown at about 7.3 per cent.
Economic growth had slowed to 4.7 per cent in 2012, according to the UN report.
During 2014, East Asia, including China, managed to register relatively robust growth, while India led South Asia to a moderate strengthening.
Developing countries as a group are expected to grow at 4.8 per cent in 2015 and 5.1 per cent in 2016, up from the 4.3 per cent estimated for 2014.
The report added that along with robust external demand, growth is expected to be underpinned by a moderate strengthening of domestic consumption and investment as countries benefit from improved macroeconomic conditions.
"Several countries, notably India, are likely to make progress in implementing economic policy reforms, thus providing support to business and consumer confidence," it said.

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty plunge on global selloff; realty  auto stocks hitStreet sees good show after stellar year
The benchmark BSE Sensex tumbled over 258 points to 27,572.70 and the NSE Nifty slumped by 74.15 points to trade below 8,300-mark in early trade today on sustained foreign fund outflows, tracking weak global cues amid plunging crude prices.
The 30-share index fell by 258.40 points, or 0.92 per cent, to 27,572.70, with all the sectoral indices led by capital goods, realty, auto, metal and PSU trading in the negative zone.
The gauge had gained 34.09 points in yesterday’s volatile trade.
Also, the National Stock Exchange index Nifty shed 74.15 points, or 0.88 per cent, to 8,281.50 in early trade.
Brokers said a weak trend on other Asian bourses, tracking overnight losses on US markets after a pullback in petroleum stocks sparked a selloff, mainly dampened trading sentiment here.
Meanwhile, Brent for January settlement dropped by USD 2.60 to a fresh five-year low of USD 64.24 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in yesterday’s trade.
In addition, depreciating rupee which weakened by 15 paise to over one-week low of 62.17 against the dollar also had negative impact, they said.
Among other Asian markets, Japan’s Nikkei shed 1.33 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 1.08 per cent in early trade today.
The US Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.51 per cent lower in yesterday’s trade.

12-point questionnaire in hand  cops grill uber cabs Asia head on day 2Roche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
The Asia-Pacific head of US-based cab service Uber was questioned by the police for the second consecutive day yesterday in connection with the rape of a 27-year-old finance executive by the company’s driver, during which he was asked about details of their safety features, details of drivers among others.
During questioning, which took place for nearly two hours, Eric Alexander, the Uber Asia-Pacific head was handed over a 12 point questionnaire by police which included details of all the taxis and its drivers working with them and how they checked their antecedents and the details of the directors of the company, its security features and background check mechanism.
Delhi court sends Uber cab driver, accused of raping a 27-year-old woman, in judicial custody till December 24.
— Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) December 11, 2014
“Alexander has asked for a week’s time to submit the answers of the questions as some of them had to be sourced from their headquarters in San Francisco,” said DCP (North) Madhur Verma.
The police which had registered an FIR against the company is yet to decide on who faces the liability for the negligence on part of Uber.
The Hong Kong-based executive was also asked whether they had received any prior complaints about Shiv Kumar Yadav, the accused in this case, route of the cab and of the accused on the day of the incident, number of drops Yadav did during his period with the company and the feedback about him from customers.
Alexander had reached the DCP office at Civil Lines in the evening along with the General Manager (Marketing) Gagan Bhatia in the evening.
He was also asked about the India operations of the company and its organizational structure.
Police officials also suggested that an emergency button should be present in the car in case of any emergency.
My deepest sympathies with the victim. We are cooperating with the police and I cannot divulge further details since investigations are underway, Alexander told reporters after the questioning.
He had joined the investigation on Tuesday and had met senior police officials of north district at Civil Lines.
He was issued a notice by police under section 91 CrPC to provide certain documents of the company.
He had also  visited the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) office on Tuesday after being summoned by it.
Delhi Police, which has already filed an FIR against Uber charging it with cheating its customers and defying government orders, has been questioning senior Uber officials for the last three days.
The company was banned from operating in the city by Delhi government on Monday.
Shiv Kumar Yadav, who was driving the uber cab, had allegedly raped the woman on Friday night when the victim, who works for a finance company in Gurgaon, was headed back to her home in north Delhi’s Inderlok area.

PM Narendra Modi expected to seek Moscow's help to set up sovereign fund

(Russia has two sovereign…)
NEW DELHI: India is likely to seek Russia's assistance to set up a sovereign wealth fund when Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. New Delhi is aiming to set up a state-owned fund to channel investment to the country's cash-starved infrastructure sector, while Moscow has the expertise to run such funds.
Russia has two sovereign funds fuelled by its oil boom and a third, called Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which seeks to facilitate flow of overseas capital to the Russian economy by co-investing with foreign investors and through long-term partnerships.
Sources in a Russian business delegation, which is in Delhi coinciding with Putin's visit, told ET that India has approached RDIF to set up a fund here. "The matter is on the agenda of discussion when Modi meets Putin, and later again when both the Indian PM and the President meet Russian business honchos and their Indian counterparts," a source said.
He refused to divulge details of the agenda on the eve of the first Russia-India annual summit since the Modi government came to power. No details were available on the sovereign wealth fund the Modi government is considering as officials in the Indian government were unwilling to comment ahead of the summit.
One of the main focus areas of the Modi government is infrastructure, a sector that is key to overall economic growth but has been struggling for want of funds.
  According to experts, India's poor infrastructure is shaving off as much as two percentage points from gross domestic product. A sovereign funds targetting the sector could help quicken development of roads, ports and other infrastructure.
The Indian government has been mulling for some time to set up a sovereign wealth fund. According to some people, this could be funded by floating domestic bonds.
That would allow India to structure the fund differently compared with conventional wealth funds in countries like Norway, Singapore, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, the UAE, Kuwait and Russia - since these are current-account-surplus economies, they don't have to raise money from the market.
Indo-Russian economic ties, which many say have much more potential than what they are now, will receive a fillip following Thursday's summit, sources said, pointing out that New Delhi has already made it clear that it will not be a party to economic sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine issue.
Russian Direct Investment Fund Chief Executive Kirill Dmitriev, in Delhi to sign two deals with infrastructure finance company IDFC and Tata Power, told ET that the fund has expertise to help India set up a similar structure and, can also involve in its international partners from China, Japan, South Korea, Italy, France and the Gulf countries in the process.
"These entities led by RDIF can share expertise with India in setting up the fund and how joint projects can be undertaken," Dmitriev added.
He will be one of the Russian chief executives who will interact with PM Modi as well as participate in the Indo-Russian joint CEOs' meeting.
RDIF is a $10 billion fund established by the Russian government in June 2011 to make equity investments in high-growth sectors of the Russian economy. RDIF's mandate is to co-invest alongside global investors and act as a catalyst for foreign investments.
Together with coinvestors, it has invested and committed more than $7 billion of investments within Russia, of which RDIF alone invested $1.3 billion. Russia's two other oil revenuefunded sovereign wealth funds have combined reserves of $177 billion.

Modi-Putin dialogue may lead to easier oil imports from Russiainvestments
(Russian oil firm Rosneft recently…)
NEW DELHI: Talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin in Delhi on Thursday may pave the way for easier import of oil from Russia.
India, which has approached Russian company Rosneft to reconsider its proposal to pick about 25% stake in Vankor oil field in east Siberia for about $2.5 billion, is expected to raise the matter during Putin's two-day visit, government officials said.
Russian oil firm Rosneft recently sold to China 10% stake in the field, which has estimated recoverable reserves of 500 million tonnes of oil and 182 billion cubic metres of gas.
Putin's visit comes after a rail network connecting Iran , Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan was launched last week that could link to Bandar Abbas port in Persian Gulf for transportation.
Indian firms are interested in investing in Russia provided they are allowed to bring equity oil and gas to India, officials said, adding that the government expects Russia to extend tax concessions to ONGC-owned Imperial Energy operating in Siberia which is facing acute financial crisis after estimates from its oilfields fell sharply due to geological complexities.
"Russia provides tax concessions to oil fields in difficult terrains, but the same is not available to Imperial's field. As a result, the company is making losses," an industry executive said, requesting anonymity.
State-run ONGC , which acquired Imperial Energy for $2.1 billion five years ago, is struggling to revive the company.
The rail network launched last month is about 908 km long, of which 120 km is in Kazakhstan, 700 in Turkmenistan and 88 km in Iran. It will connect with Iranian railway network all the way to Bandar Abbas port, enabling easy transportation of oil from Russia and central Asian countries to India, officials said.
The international railway will also help expand overall trade with Russia and central Asia, officials said, adding that absence of direct link with the Eurasian region has been the biggest impediment in furthering economic ties.
India is also keen on Russian investments in its oil and gas projects. "ONGC Videsh has largest investment of over $8 billion in Russia, but Russian companies are only interested in service contracts and sale of equipment. We will ask the visiting delegation to also encourage Russian investments in India's oil and gas sector," an official said.

Russian President Vladmir Putin to sweeten deals during his visit by offering wines from Crimea

(In keeping with this, a top…)
NEW DELHI: Love for spirits knows no boundaries and political divides: it finds its destination in its quest for markets and admirers. And with India refusing to support Western sanctions against Russia despite recent pressure, President Vladmir Putin would sweeten deals during his trip to India by offering wines from Crimea, a region that was annexed by Moscow following the Ukraine crisis.
In keeping with this, a top leader from Crimea will also be accompanying Putin to explore business ties with India.
Since sanctions were imposed on Russia, wines from Crimea have not made it to the drawing and dining rooms of the West, notwithstanding its quality and taste. During a recent visit to Moscow, ahead of Putin's India visit, head of Crimea Sergey Aksyonov requested the Russian federal government to facilitate exporting wines to India, according to officials.
Aksyonov was also approached by entrepreneurs looking to tap this burgeoning market in India. Crimea has a great potential in terms of growing grapes, and vineyards occupy more than 30,000 hectares of the Crimean peninsula.
The local administration wants to give momentum to its wine industry for revenues, officials pointed out. Earlier this year, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had said his government would support the Crimean wine industry for economic revival of the region. Wine from Crimea was considered the best in Russia during the Czarist rule.
Besides China, India is among the fastest growing wine markets. Crimean wines would have a distinct price advantage in India when pitted against wines from Spain, France and Chile, according to Russian government officials. However, a source in the Indian wine industry is cautiously optimistic.
"Crimea and its nearby countries in Eurasia which also produce good wine are relatively unknown in India. First, these countries should promote themselves in India and then their wine. This is an effective way to make wines popular," the source suggested.
In 1820, during the reign of Catherine II, Count Mikhail Vorontsov planted the first wine gardens in Crimea and established a large winery near Yalta. A viticulture research institute called Magarach was founded eight years later.
In the 19th century, Crimean wine was considered the best in all of the Russian empire. Today, the most well-known wines from Crimea are Massandra and Novy Svet. The companies have been producing sweet and fortified wines in the French style.

Trade with Asean to touch $100 billion next year

(Sitharaman said that…)
NEW DELHI: The two-way trade between India and Asean are expected to double from the current level of $ 80 billion by 2022 even as it is expected to touch $ 100 billion by next year on account of increasing commercial engagement between the two sides.
"In 2009, FTA in goods was signed with ASEAN and because of that and through that trade between India and ASEAN have been reaching about $ 80 billion level. We hope by 2015 it will touch $ 100 billion and get doubled by 2022. So there is lot of scope," Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today said.
She was speaking at 2nd India-CLMV (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam) Business Conclave here. These countries are members of the 10-nation bloc Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean).
The minister said that free trade agreement (FTA) in services and investments with the region would come into effect from July 1, 2015.
She also said that a lot of business opportunities exist in the region and both the sides can enhance cooperation in areas including agriculture, skill development, energy and textiles.
Speaking about the CLMV region, she said that Laos provides huge opportunities for Indian businesses in hydro-power generation.
Laos has 26,000 MW hydro-power capacity but the installed capacity is only 7,000 MW.
Sitharaman said that north-eastern states of India is keen to enhance economic ties with CLMV region.
"We are very keen to open north-east part of India to increase connectivity with this region. We are looking at north-east as a threshold tool for our Act East Policy... India's Look East Policy (LEP) is a major pillar of foreign affairs. Now our attempt to sharp focus the LEP and (make it) and Act East policy," she added.
She also said that India is working on the increasing air, rail, road and sea connectivity between India and CLMV region.
There is a proposal to develop a trilateral highway connecting India, Myanmar and Thailand.
However, the minister also raised concerns about pepper imports from Asean members to India.
"Kerala has expressed a lot of concerns about pepper which comes into the country from Vietnam which they are willing to accept but if there are pepper coming from countries which do not grow pepper at all. They (Kerala producers) are worried as to where this pepper comes from...
"And these are issues which can rankle and therefore in engaging particularly with CLMV, I would certainly want greater trust and confidence in talking about not just manufactured goods but also about agri products in which some states in India always have the lead advantage," she said.
During the signing of India-Asean free trade pact, farmer organisations had raised concerns on the matter. According to reports, the import of cheap and inferior pepper had impacted domestic prices and led to distress for farmers growing pepper.
Sitharaman also said India-CLMV trade was concentrated in only a few items and there was tremendous scope to deepen and widen the trade basket.
She said that there is a need of greater and accelerated engagement across the globe with East Asia.
"Commerce, Culture and Connectivity are the three pillars of India's engagement with the CLMV countries," she said adding "it is imperative that India deepens its trade and investment with these four countries".
Currently, 70-80 per cent of India-CLMV trade is centred around only a few products.
  "I think there is a scope to expand the basket and bring in more commodities and manufactured goods into it... Government has accorded high priority to economic engagements with the four countries, and is working towards establishing seamless physical connectivity with the region," she added.
Robust physical connectivity through road, rail and sea links will enable businesses on both sides to leverage the opportunities created by the India-ASEAN free trade pact in goods, the minister said.
"Seamless connectivity will spur people-to-people contacts and tourism, create new enterprises and millions of jobs for people in the region, especially when the economic corridors along the India-CLMV road and rail lines would be completely fully developed," she further said.
Speaking at the occasion, Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher said that India's trade with the CLMV region amounted to USD 13 billion in 2013-14.
"Much of that trade was with Vietnam. There was tremendous scope to expand trade relations with the other countries in the region. There is a need to establish regional and sub-regional value chains in order to maintain and sustain long-term economic relationship with the region," he said.
He stated that Indian companies could partner with businesses in the CLMV countries to reach out to newer markets.
He felt that by joining forces, Indian and CLMV industry could take advantage of the trade agreement architecture that the CLMV countries have to access newer markets.

Technofab Engg eyes Rs 450-460 revenues in FY15Finance costs are primarily due to very high receivables and that is also on account of customers not being able to release funds to us.

"Letter of awards have been received for Rs 54 crore for a waste water rehabilitation project in Kenya and for Rs 208 crore for a rural electrification project in Bihar," said the company in its filing.
Gupta said the debt for the company currently stands at Rs 100 crore.
Below is the transcript of Arjun Gupta’s interview with Sumaira Abidi and Reema Tendulkar on CNBC-TV18.

A: Only about 10 percent not more than that. Rest of it would be in following years, mainly in 2016.
Reema: What are the margins on these new orders?
A: Margins these days are pretty strained. What would happen is down the line we would see some lowering of raw material cost which will help increase our margins in 2015 but not in the current quarter.

Market exuberance: Rational or irrationalMarket exuberance: Rational or irrational?
Ishan Bakshi | New Delhi Dec 15, 2014 10:46 PM IST
Despite sluggish growth, the Sensex has risen roughly 30 per cent since December last year. While markets are forward looking, with key economic indicators pointing to sluggish growth, does this rally reflect expectations of improving fundamentals in the coming quarters, or are markets moving ahead of reality and likely to correct?
According to analysts, the sharp rally over the past year could be attributed to two factors. First, the expectation that the general elections will bring to the helm of affairs a stable government, bold enough to undertake a wide range of systemic reforms that India needs. Second, in the global economy, with weak growth in the euro zone and Japan and with China slowing, India seems  favourably placed.
The macro adjustment process, with compression of the current account and fiscal deficits, a moderation in inflation and growth appearing on the upswing, have improved India’s standing in the global economy, making it an attractive opportunity in the emerging market (EM) portfolio. According to Morgan Stanley, global emerging market fund managers are most overweight on India, 700 basis points more than the MSCI EM benchmark, which for India is at the highest level in the past five years, suggesting renewed interest in the country.
But while current valuations might seem elevated in the face of weak economic growth expected in the coming quarters, these do not seem to indicate irrational exuberance. Based on the PE ratio, markets are trading only slightly higher than their historical trading band but are lower than the peak of 2007, suggesting rational exuberance.
According to Sampath Reddy, chief investment officer at Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, “markets have moved up a lot in the past one year (30 per cent plus). If you adjust for earnings growth during this period, the re-rating would be very small. In addition to the macro strengths, the recent fall in global crude oil prices further strengthens India’s attractiveness. While the stocks have moved up in the past year, given these positive developments, the earnings growth is likely to be robust for next couple of years. So, they are not overvalued”.
Dipen Shah, head of private client  research at Kotak Securities, adds: “Earnings growth could justify higher valuations. While India is trading at a slightly higher end of the historical band of the past 10-12 years, it promises higher growth, which will translate into higher corporate earnings.”
But earnings growth in the recent quarter has been below expectations. The Kotak report points out that “results in the September quarter of 2014-15 were universally below expectations and underlying trends are still quite weak for us to make a case for earnings upgrades”. Net profits in the quarter for the BSE-30 index grew six per cent, well below the expectation of 10 per cent. While the Kotak report lowers expectations of 2014-15 earnings, it expects almost 18 per cent growth in net profits for the BSE-30 companies and 16.3 per cent for the Nifty-50 ones — higher than the expected nominal growth for gross domestic product in the current financial year.
The expectation of higher margins is based on a transition towards a low inflation and interest rate scenario. A big positive over the past few months has been a moderation in inflation, which creates space for the Reserve Bank (RBI’s) to lower interest rates, a combination of which will improve corporate margins. Morgan Stanley estimates that rising interest costs had accounted for two-thirds of the net margin decline of 500 basis point since 2007-08. This is a big positive for the market.
According to Reddy, “We expect the earnings to grow faster than the growth in top line, driven by higher utilisation, lower interest costs and better pricing. Lower commodity prices will lead to significant cost savings. Also, the interest costs for most leveraged companies will come down as interest rates start declining, coupled with a de-leveraging initiative taken by most companies”.
According to economists, when RBI lowers rates, it will be an inflection point, marking a decisive shift, for two reasons. It will not only lower borrowing costs for companies and could potentially help revive the investment cycle, but the moderation in inflation could also potentially trigger a shift in the household fund allocation in favour of financial assets, which had fallen to 7.1 per cent in 2012-13 from a high of 12 per cent in 2009-10. Even if a portion of this $90 billion is invested, it could drive up the markets.
Analysts expect the first leg of earnings growth to likely come from an improvement in margins, followed by a revival in the investment cycle and resurgence in demand. But, this is where the concern lies. Private investment continues to remain weak with corporate balance sheets still under stress. Bank credit offtake continues to be slow, suggesting low demand and government spending likely to fall sharply in the coming quarters to meet the fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product.
Further, the consumer goods segment in the Index of Industrial Production has contracted in 10 of the past 11 months, indicating weak demand. This suggests current valuations might not be sustainable and markets could correct, in the absence of big-bang reforms.
According to analysts, the implementation of GST, speedy clearances, land reforms and attractive policies for foreign capital are some of the key factors for market performance.
With expectations that some of the key issues will be addressed in the Budget, markets are likely to trade with an upward bias till February. Morgan Stanley’s Sensex target for the year to end December 2015 is 32,500, while Citi has upped its forecast to 33,000 for this period.

FM Arun Jaitley says a civilised tax policy on cardsFM Arun Jaitley says a civilised tax policy on cards
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 15:47 IST
FM Arun Jaitley
Union finance minister Arun Jaitley said in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday that "the government would endeavour to usher in a civilised tax policy to attract overseas investment".
Justifying the need for a civilised tax regime, Jaitley took a dig at the erstwhile United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government saying "ultra-aggressive tax policy has not helped in getting any additional revenue".
In an oblique reference to the Vodafone case, he said that the retrospective tax amendment brought during the UPA regime had only brought a bad name to India rather than garner any additional revenue.
"We inherited an economic situation of negative sentiment where none was willing to invest. There was reduced economic activity. The negative sentiment was further accelerated by ultra-aggressive tax policy," Jaitley said.
The minister also talked about the move to bring much-delayed goods and services tax (GST), on which he will meet state finance ministers on Thursday.
"GST is not an issue on which we are divided on partisan line. Most state governments are going to benefit. The revenues are going to improve as  and states are concerned, and I wish to assure this House with this commitment," he said.
Underlining that growth would depend on the states, Jaitley talked about cooperative federalism and announced release of Rs 11,000 crore to states this fiscal as part payment towards CST compensation to facilitate rollout of GST.
Jaitley was replying to a debate in the Lok Sabha on Supplementary Demands for Grants for an additional expenditure of over Rs 12,500 crore.
However, the actual cash outgo would be Rs 500 crore. The demands were later passed by the House. On the growth prospects, Jaitley said that there are challenges but hoped that it would be within the projected range of 5.4-5.9 per cent in 2014-15 and cross six per cent in the next financial year.
Economic growth fell to subfive per cent in two consecutive fiscals 2012-13 and 2013-14, Jaitley said, adding it had an impact on revenue collection, fiscal deficit and government's expenditure on developmental works.
For the second quarter of FY15, GDP grew 5.3 per cent compared with 5.7 per cent in the previous quarter mainly due to slow growth in the manufacturing sector.

Global Shares, Oil Steady Ahead of Crunch ECB Loan Offer
Reuters | Updated On: December 11, 2014 15:44 (IST)
L&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
London: World stocks and oil prices steadied on Thursday as investors waited to see how much help the ECB's latest funding flood could provide the euro zone and if an expected sharp hike in Russian interest rates could stabilise the rouble.
European shares nudged higher in opening deals and the dollar also halted its abrupt slide of the last few days as investors caught their breath after some sell-offs exacerbated by the year-end drop in trading volumes.
The ECB is offering banks ultra-cheap, four-year loans as part of a package of measures to add around 1 trillion euros to its balance sheet - a goal it has set with a view to pumping money into the economy to save it from deflation.
But a Reuters poll carried out this week points to only around 130 billion euro being taken. After a disappointing first round in September, it could strengthen the case for the more controversial option of sovereign bond buying.
"A low take-up (on Thursday) clearly strengthens the rationale to adopt a broad-based asset-purchase programme, or QE," said Andrew Bosomworth, a senior portfolio manager at Pimco in Munich.
The ECB will announce the results around 1015 GMT.
German bond yields were pinned at record lows before the handout, while Greek bonds also steadied, having been sent into a tailspin this week by the Greek prime minister's decision to bring forward a presidential vote.
In the currency market the euro was holding its ground. The Swiss franc climbed as its central bank kept rates steady while the dollar inched higher versus the yen, after falling roughly 3 per cent in the past three days.
Focus was also on a meeting of Russia's central bank later. It is expected to hike its interest rates at least a 100 basis points in a bid to halt the 40 per cent plunge in the rouble that is threatening to throw the country into a full-blown financial crisis.
"There is no way this won't be impacting the banks and the corporates," said UBS strategist Manik Narain. "They should send a much more determined signal that they will do whatever it takes for as long as it takes."
Both the rouble and Russia stocks drifted lower in Moscow.
Oil pause
Asian stocks sagged overnight after the decline in oil prices took a heavy toll on energy shares and hit Wall Street hard.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.7 per cent as the volatile Shanghai Composite Index shed earlier gains and fell 0.8 per cent after regulators announced a flood of IPO approvals.
Tokyo's Nikkei lost 1 per cent, pulling further back from 7-1/2 year highs hit at the week's start, with sentiment bruised by the rout in US stocks and the firmer yen.
Despite the recent volatility displayed by the dollar, the divergence in US monetary policy from Europe and Japan could continue to favour the greenback in the long term.
New Zealand's central bank governor said he expected to see the most quantitative easing since 2011 around the world next year, particularly as economic risks in Japan and Europe remain.
"There are question marks around Japan and certainly in Europe," Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler told a media briefing.
Brent crude ticked higher in early European trading but remained below $65 per barrel, not far from a five-year low hit in the previous session.
Comments on Wednesday by the Saudi Arabian oil minister shrugging off an output cut renewed worries of a global glut in oil that has driven the third biggest slump in oil prices ever this year.
"This is a bit of a return to a more normal pattern of trading for us," said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist for CMC Markets in Sydney.

L&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
New Delhi: Snapping a two-day rising streak, gold prices today fell by Rs 170 to Rs 27,300 per ten grams at the bullion market in the national capital owing to slackened demand from jewellers and retailers.
Silver also eased by Rs 200 to Rs 38,200 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said besides easing demand from jewellers and retailers at existing levels, a weak global trend mainly led to the fall in gold and silver prices.
Globally, gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, shed 0.05 per cent to $1,225.50 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity fell by Rs 170 each to Rs 27,300 and Rs 27,100 per ten gram respectively. It had gained Rs 820 in the past two days.
Sovereign, however, held steady at Rs 23,800 per piece of eight gram in limited deals.
Following gold, silver ready moved down by Rs 200 to Rs 38,200 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 85 at Rs 38,530 per kg.
On the other hand, silver coins traded at last level of Rs 63,000 for buying and Rs 64,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

No change in UNFCCC required: JavadekarPrakash Javadekar
New Delhi, Dec. 11:  
Resistance from India continues at the UN’s climate change talks with Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Environment, saying the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change does not need to be changed.
“We are here to enhance the implementation of the Convention, certainly not to re-write it,” he said in Lima, Peru, referring to the concept of ‘evolving CBDR (common but differentiated responsibility)’.
He added that there is a need to ensure “an ambitious, comprehensive, equitable and balanced agreement in 2015 that takes into account the huge development needs, including access to financial resources and low carbon technological options for developing countries.”
India has been resisting certain changes to the UNFCCC being attempted by the developed countries, such as review of intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) that will be declared by developing countries by June, 2015.
Besides, several developed countries are also pushing to change the definition of CBDR to bring more accountability on countries that were earlier identified as developing, but have since become economically stronger — such as China and India.
Javadekar further said that besides mitigation of climate change, the focus also needs to be on adaptation measures for the effects of climate change.
“Developing countries are allocating significant portions of their scarce national resources on adaptation, which remains an immediate and urgent global priority… We therefore completely share the view of developing countries that the INDCs must not be limited to mitigation alone,” he said.

Russian bank VTB
will open a $1 billion credit line to India's Essar Group, chief executive Andrei Kostin said on Thursday during a visit to New Delhi by President Vladimir Putin.
Kostin also said that VTB would not ask for more than 250 billion roubles ($4.6 billion) in financial assistance from a government rainy-day fund called the National Wealth Fund.
Russian banks have faced difficulties in refancing due to Western sanctions.
Kostin also said that state-controlled VTB has no plans to leave the London Stock Exchange, where its shares are listed.

Govt pushes to revive jaded relationship with RussiaGovt pushes to revive jaded relationship with Russia

Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Russian President Vladimir Putin
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin got straight down to talks on Thursday on boosting nuclear and defence cooperation at a summit aimed at reviving an old friendship that has faded over the years.
Putin's one-day visit to India comes at a time when Russia is at odds with the West over Ukraine, and its economy is stalling as oil prices tumble to their lowest in five years.
The tension over Ukraine intruded on the choreographed visit when it emerged that the leader of Crimea, the former Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia, had travelled with Putin to India for unofficial talks to enhance trade.
Govt does not support Western sanctions against Russia, but the Crimean leader's presence may prove an irritant before US President Barack Obama visits the country next month.
Modi, elected by a landslide six months ago, is expected to give Obama a far more lavish reception as chief guest of nation's Republic Day celebrations than Thursday's formal summitry.
Yet Moscow's eye has wandered too since its Soviet-era romance with New Delhi. Bilateral trade, at $10 billion, is now one-ninth of that between Russia and China - the focus of Putin's pivot away from an increasingly critical Europe.
"Russia is a tried and trusted friend - a country that has helped us in times of trouble," a country's official told Reuters. "But that friendship hasn't delivered in terms of its economic potential."
The two leaders presided over the signing of a "vision" document setting out a roadmap for cooperation over an extended period, with the most ambitious area nuclear energy.
Russia's state-owned Rosatom said that under an agreement signed on Thursday it would supply 12 nuclear energy reactors for India over 20 years.
A 1,000-megawatt reactor is operating at the Russian-built Kudankulam power station in south India, with a second due onstream in 2015. Putin had been pushing for Rosatom to increase the number of reactors it could supply to as many as 25.
Indian officials say a total of six reactors will be built at Kudankulam , with a further six to follow at a site that has not yet been determined.
Other strategic deals were expected to cover oil exploration and supply, infrastructure and an increase in direct diamond sales to India by Russian state monopoly Alrosa.
On defence, the two sides will seek to move ahead with long-delayed projects to develop a joint fifth-generation fighter jet and a multi-role transport aircraft.
A spokesman for India's foreign minister said he was not officially aware of Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov's visit.
Gul Kripalani, a Mumbai businessman who met the Crimean leader at a New Delhi hotel as head of the Indian-Crimean Partnership, told Reuters the talks were unofficial and Aksyonov had "happened to be on the flight with His Excellency President Putin".
Western countries imposed sanctions against Russia over the annexation of Crimea in February and the Kremlin's support for an uprising by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Russia remains India important defence partner  says PM Narendra Modi; both countries sign key nucleardealWritten by Shubhajit Roy | New Delhi |
Posted: December 12, 2014 12:06 am | Updated: December 12, 2014 9:27 am
Unitedly opposing economic sanctions that do not have the UNSC’s approval, India and Russia on Thursday sought to strengthen their “special strategic partnership” by announcing a clutch of agreements in energy and defence, including Moscow’s help in building at least 12 nuclear reactors and a plan to manufacture advanced Russian military helicopters and defence spare parts in India.
Unveiling a “Druzhba-Dosti” vision statement for the next decade after a four-hour long meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pitched for “at least 10 more (nuclear) reactors” with the highest standards of safety. “It will include manufacture of equipment and components in India. This also supports our Make in India policy,” he said.
A strategic vision document on nuclear power signed on Thursday said both sides would strive to complete the construction and commissioning of “not less than 12 units” in the next two decades, in accordance with the 2008 agreement. Towards this objective, the Indian side agreed to expeditiously identify a second site, in addition to Kudankulam, for the construction of the Russian-designed nuclear power units in India.
“We have just signed a document of great significance — the strategic vision for strengthening Indian-Russian cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear power. It contains plans to build over 20 nuclear power units in India, as well as cooperation in building Russia-designed nuclear power stations in third countries, in the joint extraction of natural uranium, production of nuclear fuel and waste elimination. This will lay the foundation for our long-term mutually beneficial cooperation in the nuclear sector,” said Putin.
Russian government officials said Moscow has “in principle” agreed to the Indian nuclear liability law, factoring in the costs involved in the process. This led to the signing of the supplement to the General Framework Agreement (GFA) for Units 3 and 4 of Kudankulam nuclear power project between Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and Atomstroyexport on Thursday.
The issue of nuclear liability has been dogging the sector, as the American and French firms have not been able to overcome the issue. This has prevented the US and French nuclear firms from starting work on setting up the nuclear power projects in the last five years.
Stressing that Russia would remain India’s most important defence partner “even if India’s options have increased”, Modi said, “We discussed how to align our defence relations to India’s own priorities, including Make in India… Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters. It includes the possibility of exports from India. It can be used for both military and civilian use. We will follow up on this quickly.”
He also proposed that Russia should locate in India manufacturing facilities for spares and components for its defence equipment. “He responded continued…

Corning claims Gorilla Glass 4 twice as tough as any other glass inmarketWritten by Nandagopal Rajan |
Posted: December 11, 2014 3:45 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 3:48 pm
Corning Incorporated on Thursday announced the introduction of Corning Gorilla Glass 4 to India’s consumer electronics market. Corning claims its product is up to two times tougher than any competitive cover glass design now in the market.
Amit Bansal, president, Corning Technologies, India, said the company was is constant touch with Indian OEMs to understand their requirements. “It is one of the fastest growing consumer electronics markets in the world and it therefore makes perfect sense to equip manufactures here with the very best in cover glass technology,” he added.
James Hollis, director, Sales and Engineering, Gorilla Glass, Specialty Materials  said the Corning Glass 4 had significantly improved damage resistance. He claimed it out performs all existing glass for sharp contact damage.
Hollis said their data showed that most damage was caused to glass by drops on asphalt and not smooth surfaces.
The company claims Gorilla Glass 4 survives up to 80% of the time Soda-lime glass, as deployed in today’s commercial devices, breaks nearly 100% of the time. Gorilla Glass 4 is manufactured using Corning’s proprietary fusion draw process and maintains the thinness, durability, and optical clarity.

Oil demand in emerging markets will moderate: Platts
According to Vandana Hari, the demand picture for oil is not looking good in the medium-term.

Halftime Report
Brent crude slips further on Wednesday falling below USD 65 per barrel level for the first time in five years after Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) projected that demand for its crude would sink next year to levels not seen in more than a decade. OPEC has predicted 2015 demand to drop to 28.9 million barrel a day (bpd) versus 29.4 million bpd in 2014.
Crude has fallen about 40 percent since June, dragging global markets along with it. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Vandana Hari, Asia Editorial Director, Platts said the oil demand in emerging economies will moderate. According to her, the demand picture is not looking good in the medium-term.
Below is verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: What is your bull and bear scenario for oil? Could it be as bad as USD 50/barrel like some are saying by the end of the year?
A: Right now it does seem very bearish. I can see very few factors on the horizon that might stem the fall, let alone send prices moving up again because some of the fundamentals that have been responsible for pushing prices down since mid year are only getting more exaggerated coming even more into greater focus.
We saw for instance yesterday apart from Naimi’s comments, digging in his heels about not cutting.
At the same time OPEC also came out with its projections for next year the demand on its oil, it said will be 28.9 million barrels/day and contrast that with the group’s decision to keep output at 30 and the actual output will actually be even more than 30 million barrels/day.
So OPEC clearly admitting that there is going to be more than 1 million barrels/day of oil production from that group alone. Not to mention US may likely add another 700,000-800,000 barrels/day and pitted against this is the increasingly bleak demand scenario.
Demand even in centres like China, India, the emerging economy looks like it is going to start moderating hugely even if not collapsing, so overall a bearish scenario.
There is always the unanticipated geopolitical factor. So if there is a major outage which is still a possibility, I won’t rule it out in places like Libya, Nigeria.
To my mind that is the only thing that might put an immediate bottom right now. Otherwise it will continue to drift lower till it finds the balancing point.
Q: What according to you will be the price at which crude can potentially stabilise?
A: Instead of trying to focus on a number which is proving even the most experienced of market watchers wrong I am tending to focus my attention on what signs are we seeing that might restore the balance. So that might put a floor on the prices.
Are we seeing any production cuts happening? The straight answer for that is no, not yet. So, that is what I will really be looking for.
Until a few weeks ago I was also looking for signs of recovering demand, especially in the emerging economies that are still doing well like China and India. But now I am not that optimistic on it because Chinese demand has come up just 2 percent year-on-year (YoY) for the first 22 months of the year and a lot of other signs that next year Chinese economy might face even greater headwinds.
I won’t hold my breath for any major increase in Chinese oil demand next year either. The same goes for India.
Russian demand has been holding up remarkably but I am very pessimistic about that as well given the state of Russian economy that demand might also go down next year and then we have all the Latin American countries in fresh economic trouble as well. So, it really doesn’t look like a good picture on the demand side.
What I will really be looking out for now is any indication of either companies telling us directly or any indication that they are starting to cut back production, not spending on new production because that is already happening but is there any reduction in output that is happening.
Q: Do you think there is a likelihood that OPEC may consider revising or at least reviewing their decision before their next meeting which is in June?
A: Of course a lot of attention being focussed on that as well because given OPEC’s history and well documented move to control and try and balance market prices it is natural for the market participants to look at OPEC and expect them to do something.
There also seems to be a lot of dissonance within OPEC itself, obviously OPEC members like Venezuela and Iran were very much in favour of the cartel and reducing its production but the Saudi seems to have taken and their decision really holds. They seems to have taken a completely opposite stance.
There seems to be some rumbling within the organisation as well. I can see some of the pronouncements coming out from the Saudi Oil Minister Naimi as well.
I would be very surprised if they reverse the course that they have taken and say, okay now we will do something that argument is just too compelling, why should OPEC cut if they cut prices recover and then the US oil production comes back to the market.
Why should they suffer in order for somebody else somewhere to benefit from the recovery in oil prices. I don’t think that is going to happen but time will tell.
Q: At what price does US shale production become unviable for them?
A: It is a whole range of prices. The other argument that you need to keep in mind, I know USD 60-65/barrel is a number that has been circulated the most but what you need to keep in mind is the staying power of the company. So it is not just oil in the US but oil prices have fallen way below what some of the OPEC producers want as well. What really comes into play now are not just the breakeven cost of production but the fiscal breakeven price and the staying power.
Some of the companies in the US that are producing tight oil are hedged for instance for 2015. So they might be in a far better condition to weather this period of low oil prices. As a result, it might be a while before we actually see the impact of the current low prices translating into any reduction in the US production. It might even happen beyond 2015 for all we know.

Moneycontrol Bureau
Homegrown automobile major Mahindra & Mahindra  is close to striking a deal with the parent company (NEVS) of Swedish carmaker Saab, according to a recent Dow Jones report, which cited court documents submitted in the parent’s bankruptcy case pointing to the Indian company.
If the deal comes through, M&M will become the fourth owner of Saab in as many years (GM, Spyker and current parent NEVS), not counting a near-complete deal when Spyker had to call off its sale to two Chinese automakers at the last moment.
Even as Saab -- best remembered as a automaker that made premium cars with names starting with the number 9 (9-3, 9-5 and so on) and which was said to inspire a small but loyal followers of “intellectuals” -- may have seen some of its brand appeal erode due to the turbulence over the past few years, it is obvious what Mahindra’s strategy is here.
For one, it is NEVS’s focus on electric vehicles that has likely caught the Indian automaker’s attention. As can be seen from M&M’s 2010 buyout of Bangalore electric carmaker Reva, it appears it is one area the company is extremely bullish on. Saab, with an electric prototype of its renowned 9-3 sedan ready, slots right into M&M’s plan.
That said, it also Saab’s former brand appeal, which may have also attracted M&M. A marketing study once labeled Saab’s small but passionate group of owners as having traits it called 'Snaabery’; another expert said a typical Saab owner was 10 times as passionate about their vehicle as the average Volkswagen owner. (It must be remembered that M&M had also bid to acquire Saab when it was put up on the block in 2012.)
Chairman Anand Mahindra was quoted in a Financial Times interview about his focus on acquiring brands thus: "We need brands, because the one thing you cannot build, if you want to grow globally at least—something that can take a lifetime, and we are in a hurry—is brands.”
However, Mahindra also needs to re-look at its aggressive M&A strategy.
In M&M’s previous buys, Reva does not appear to have made significant strides at least on the sales side, though it must be added that the size of the electric car market itself is inhibiting.
Korean automaker Ssangyong, which the carmaker acquired in 2011, continues to bleed though the company is hoping a turnaround takes place after several models planned for launch over the next two years come to the market.
M&M bought out Kinetic in 2008 to gain a foothold into the two-wheeler market but Kinetic’s refurbished scooters Stallio, Rodeo and Duro were not that successful. So much that the company decided to go back to the drawing board and recently launched the Gusto on an all-new non-Kinetic platform.
Recently, it also picked up a majority stake in French Peugeot’s two wheeler company but it is too soon to judge the acquisition.
Previously, M&M had tried, and failed, to buy brands such as Aston Martin, Jaguar Land Rover, Ducati and Saab.
M&M stock price
On January 02, 2015, Mahindra and Mahindra closed at Rs 1224.80, down Rs 11.4, or 0.92 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 1421.00 and the 52-week low was Rs 847.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 58.92 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 20.79. The latest book value of the company is Rs 270.60 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 4.53.

Calcutta bourse seeks to bring regional exchanges under foldStreet sees good show after stellar year
Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) is trying to prevent its closure by bringing all regional stock exchanges (RSEs) under its fold even as Sebi is mounting pressure for an exit. CSE has approached the finance ministry seeking permission to tie up with any clearing corporation and re-start online trading, though Sebi has mandated that CSE has to either incorporate a clearing corporation with a minimum net worth of R300 crore or tie up with a clearing corporation with net worth of same amount.
B Madhav Reddy, CSE’s MD and CEO told FE there was no way that CSE could incorporate or tie up with a clearing corporation having a net worth of R300 crore. Sebi on May 2012 came out with an exit policy for RSEs mentioning that if an RSE didn’t have a minimum annual turnover of R1,000 crore on its own platform on continuous basis and a minimum net worth of R100 crore it would have to close down operations. The stocks of the exclusively RSE listed companies would either have to get listed with national level stock exchanges or would automatically go to the dissemination board.
While all the RSEs couldn’t meet this stipulation, CSE was the only operational RSE to have had a turnover of R9,200 crore and a net worth of above R100 crore. But it was caught in the Stock Exchange and Clearing Corporation’s (SECC’s) regulation of either incorporating or tying up with clearing corporation with net worth of R300 crore.
“We have written a letter to finance minister Arun Jaitely to relax the SECC norms. CSE becoming operational will prevent exclusively RSE listed companies to go to the dissemination board and help share holders get a fair value of their investment”, Reddy said.
There are fears that 4,000 companies worth over R2 lakh crore, exclusively listed with RSEs may escape their legal obligation of giving a fair price to the share holder taking advantage of the dissemination board.
The dissemination board run by NSE, BSE and MCX does not guarantee a fair price or a fair exit, according to V Nagappan, a stock market expert. He said with the RSEs asked to close down, the options before the exclusively RSE listed companies were to either get listed with the national level stock exchanges or get delisted as per the Sebi’s delisting regulation of 2009. If the companies failed to do both, they would automatically be moved to the dissemination board.

RBI bought $2.7 bn in Oct to shore up ReStreet sees good show after stellar year
Reserve Bank of India soaked up majority of dollar inflows into the local debt market in October by buying $2.7 billion from the foreign exchange market, data from the central bank showed.
This is the second straight month when the RBI bought dollars to prevent a sharp appreciation in the rupee and also to bolster the country’s forex reserves. In October, foreign investors pumped in $2.8 billion in the debt market and $145.3 million in equities.
The RBI data also showed that the central bank had bought dollars in the forward market as well. Outstanding forward contracts of RBI rose to $10.22 billion in October from $8.4 billion in September. The central bank typically purchases dollars in the forward market to postpone the infusion of liquidity into the banking system.
RBI’s aggressive dollar purchases had been the main reason for the rupee’s stability amid such strong inflows. The Indian currency moved in a tight 60-61/$ band during October.
According to currency dealers, the central bank’s presence in the spot and forward market has kept the rupee from appreciating. In fact, the currency has depreciated to 62/$ in December. Earlier this month, RBI governor Raghuram Rajan reiterated the stance that the central bank intervenes to reduce excess volatility in the currency.

Akula  of SKS Microfinance fame  plans small bank forayStreet sees good show after stellar year
Vikram Akula, founder and former chairperson of SKS Microfinance, is set to acquire a 26% stake in financial inclusion start-up Vaya and, thereafter, apply for small bank licence, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
Akula, whose three-year non-compete agreement with SKS ended in November 2014 said Vaya intends to apply for a bank licence. “We are working with our advisors on preparing a small bank licence application.” Vaya is a business correspondent (BC) service provider, which facilitates savings and loans for self-help groups of women on behalf of banks.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had released final guidelines for small banks last month and microfinance institutions are likely to apply since they would be able to raise cheaper funds in the form of deposits.
“While Vaya has a robust plan to grow as a BC, a small bank licence will assist us in furthering financial inclusion by providing loans to small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and other unorganised sector entities,” said Vikram Akula.
However, Akula, who was also appointed Vaya chairman, added that the firm also has an option to apply for a payment bank licence. When Akula left SKS Microfinance in November 2011, he had entered into a non-compete agreement, which prevented him from entering any sector where SKS operates. “Now that my three-year non-compete period is over, I was looking to get back to financial inclusion,” said Akula.
The company, founded by former SKS Microfinance executives, opened its first branch in July 2014 and has 23 branches with 183 employees across six districts of eastern Maharashtra and northern Karnataka.

Banks may seek more equity from highly leveraged firmsStreet sees good show after stellar year
Banks may ask companies that are already highly leveraged to bring in higher equity before seeking fresh loans, RBI deputy governor SS Mundra said on Wednesday.
“If at all, there is high leverage, it does not mean that the company cannot be financed further. The only thing for further financing is that the banks may demand (from) them (companies) to bring in higher equity. Ultimately, it is for the individual banks to take decisions on what kind of debt-equity ratio they would be comfortable with,” Mundra told rpeorters on the sidelines of a CII event.
He was replying to questions on whether RBI would ask lenders to be cautious on giving fresh loans to highly leveraged companies as there were some allegations that fresh loans were offered recently to such firms. He urged lenders to consider ‘real equity’ of companies at the time of offering loans.
Mundra urged lenders to maintain some ‘self-discipline’ to thwart any dilution of regulatory norms while offering loans to entities to improve ‘performance’.
“Stress is there on the banks to improve performance in every quarter. That is where the dilutions start coming. So, quarter-to-quarter should be pursued in a healthy manner, otherwise it could be detrimental,” he said.

2015 foreign currency bond issuances may go past this years $18 bnStreet sees good show after stellar year
Issuances of foreign currency bonds by companies in 2015 may cross the current year’s total issuance of $18 billion, says bond market experts. The demand for Indian paper overseas may remain buoyant.
Manmohan Singh, MD and head of debt capital markets of India and South East Asia at RBS, believes foreign investors are likely to prefer Indian paper over other EM securities on account of positive economic data. “It (issuances) may even rise to over $20 billion next year,” said Singh. A strong and stable government at the Centre will only to add to the positive sentiment.
On other hand, interest rates in advanced economies are expected to stay benign in 2015, making it easier for companies to access cheaper fund overseas. “We believe benign interest rate environment to remain till H1 2015. The current negative interest rate regime by ECB will add to the issuance volumes across the globe,” said Singh.
In 2014, credit default spreads (CDS) or the price-to-purchase protection against the credit risk of the Indian corporate bonds narrowed by 100 bps, making it easier for companies to access the overseas bond market.
Fitch Ratings believes the growth in issuances may be driven by a need to refinance debt and fund capex once the investment cycle starts. The rating agency expects new issuers to access the overseas bond market. Real estate companies such as Indiabulls and Lodha Developers accessed the overseas bond market for the first time in 2014.
According to Singh, companies may look at other foreign currencies and not just the US dollar. Dollar-denominated bonds formed 72% of all international issuance in 2014.

Non-food credit grows 11.44%Street sees good show after stellar year
Non-food credit — loans given by banks to companies and individuals — grew at a subdued 11.44% year-on-year for the fortnight ended November 28, taking the outstanding credit in the system to Rs 61,76,881 crore, according to RBI data. The number for the fortnight ended November 14 was an equally dull 11.13% y-o-y.
Meanwhile, growth in deposits came in at 11.70% y-o-y, taking total deposits to Rs 83,17,049 crore. While time deposits grew at 11.20% y-o-y to Rs 75,43,725 crore, demand deposits were up 16.82% y-o-y at Rs 7,73,328 crore.
Credit growth, which had plummeted to a decade low of 9.8% in the fortnight ended September 5, has picked up in subsequent fortnights thereafter. With few takers for project loans, much of the disbursements relate to working capital. However, several corporates have been tapping other means of cheaper funding, such as the commercial paper (CP) market. With project sanctions having dropped by a sharp 32% in FY14, demand for project loans is unlikely to be very high this year. After announcing State Bank of India’s results for Q2FY15, chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya had said it could be a while before demand for credit picked up meaningfully.
Demand for retail loans had been fairly subdued in the festive season, bankers said. With liquidity ample, banks have been lending even to AA-rated corporates at the base rate. The base rates of most banks are in the region of 10-10.25%. Some firms have tapped the bond market where AAA-rated firms can raise 10-year bonds at anywhere between 9.40% and 9.60%.

Maharashtra sugar mills get legal notices for non-payment of FRPCommodities see longest losing streak in 23 years
Legal notices are being issued to several sugar mills in Maharashtra for non-payment of fair remunerative price (FRP) for the new season. Mills have been asked to reply to the notices in a week failing which they have been called for hearings for recovery proceedings to be held at the State Sugar Commissionerate in the next three days.
Almost all mills in Ahmednagar, Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur and Sangli have received these notices. The first instalment of cane payment in Maharashtra is expected to be either on par with FRP or more than FRP. This year, in the absence of any decision on the first instalment, mills have been instructed to pay FRP rates to farmers.
Confirming the development, Maharashtra sugar commissioner Vipin Sharma said the primary notices were issued by the regional joint directors (RJDs) in their respective regions for non-payment of FRP. “Normally, the first instalment of cane payment is made to mills after 15 days of the start of the season. This year, the season began early from November 1. However, a majority of mills in the state are yet to make cane payments to farmers,” Sharma told FE.
“A status report which speaks of the deficit in the sugar rates this year and the increasing cost of production has been sent to the state government with a recommendation for measures to be taken by the government,” he said.
The FRP for 9.5% recovery has been fixed at R2,200 a tonne and there will be a rise of R232 a tonne for every 1% rise in recovery. For 11% recovery, FRP comes to R2,650 a tonne.
Sanjiv Babar, MD, Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation ( MSCSFF) said that several mills have been issued legal notices for non-payment of FRP. “The sugar industry in Maharashtra is on the verge of collapse. Sugar prices have fallen and several mills with a negative networth who are not in a position to raise finances have no option but to resort to distress sales,” he said.

Bourses fortnightly turnover records first rise of this fiscalCommodities see longest losing streak in 23 years
The turnover of commodity exchanges rose for the first time this fiscal in the second fortnight of November, according to the latest FMC data. Although the turnover went up 8.3% to R8.32 lakh crore in the second fortnight of November, trading value during the April-November period this fiscal was still down 48% from a year before.
Trading in high-value products such as bullion, energy and metals — the worst performing segments in the futures market this fiscal — rebounded in November, boosting the overall turnover of various exchanges.
The turnover of bullion trading across exchanges rose 3.5% during the second fortnight of November. However, it was still down 58.5% year-on-year since April, mainly due to a steep fall earlier this fiscal. Similarly, trading in energy futures was the best performer last fortnight with a 57.1% rise in turnover, although the segment has still witnessed a 47.5% fall since April. Interestingly, the trading value of farm commodities dropped the most (41.6%) in the last fortnight from a year before.
The latest rise in the trading of bullion and energy futures augur well for MCX, which primarily deals in metals and energy products.
Earlier, analysts had blamed a 0.01% of transaction tax on non-farm commodity derivatives, imposed since last July, the spill-over effect of a settlement crisis at the National Spot Exchange (NSEL) and an investor shift towards equity for the plunge in the overall turnover across exchanges. The FMC data showed that the turnover of various exchanges during the April 1-November 30 period was still down at R39.88 lakh crore.
NCDEX gets nod for 17 more contracts
The Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has allowed the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) to launch 17 more futures contracts.
The contracts are in cotton (29 mm), barley, castor seed, chilli, coriander, crude palm oil, chana, guar gum, guar seed, jeera, rapeseed-mustard seed, refined soyaoil, shankar kapas, soybean, turmeric, cotton seed oil-cake and wheat, the commodity futures market regulator said on Wednesday.
Norms for warehouse accreditation relaxed
The Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) has relaxed certain norms to expedite the process of registration as well as accreditation of warehouses.
“The WDRA has taken various steps to ensure faster registration of warehouses. WDRA has issued revised norms for accreditation of warehouses by which requirement about insurance, laboratory and testing requirements, plinth height requirements, fire fighting mechanisms, have been relaxed,” the FMC said in its latest report, citing a meeting of WDRA chairman with various warehouse service providers on November 27.
“Further, WDRA has also relaxed the requirement of submission of registered lease deed/rent agreement for warehouses, wherein the unregistered lease deed/ rent agreement which clearly mentions that the warehouse is in possession of warehouse service provider (WSP) would be accepted by WDRA for the purpose of registration,” the report said.
The government made it mandatory for warehouses to register with the WDRA after the R5,600-crore settlement crisis at the National Spot Exchange (NSEL) last year.
Last month, the FMC issued uniform norms for accreditation of warehouse services providers by the commodity exchanges to ensure credibility of warehouses and the warehousing receipts issued by them. Currently, commodity exchanges follow different norms while giving accreditation to warehouses on their platform.

Govt sets April deadline for rollout of food lawCommodities see longest losing streak in 23 years
The food ministry on Wednesday asked states, including UP, West Bengal, Gujarat, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, to roll out the National Food Security Act (NFSA) by March 2015 or else they would have to buy foodgrains meant for above poverty line (APL) families at the minimum support price (MSP) given to farmers.
For distribution of foodgrains to APL families through Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), the food ministry provides foodgrains at R6 per kg for wheat and R8 per kg for rice. While NFSA envisages providing foodgrains at R2 per kg and R3 per kg for rice and wheat respectively to all the targeted beneficiaries.
Eleven states and Union territories — Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi and Chandigarh — have so far implemented the Act, some fully and others partially.
However, many of the larger states, including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, with a substantial poor population, are yet to take the plunge.
“We have asked 25 states to expedite implementation of food law. We have given a warning that if they fail to meet April deadline, the Centre will stop supply of subsidised APL foodgrains to them”, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said .
Food ministry official said that there is no provision for supply of subsidised foodgrains to APL families under the new law and, therefore, the government has issued such a warning.
At present, the government is allocating foodgrains to 11 states or UTs as per the new food security law, while the rest 25 are getting foodgrains quota as per earlier TPDS norms.
“We have given time till February to states which have implemented partially to put in place requisite infrastructure. If digitisation of beneficiaries is not completed, we will supply foodgrains to the extent of the online list of beneficiaries,” Paswan said.
However, Jharkhand and Odisha have informed the food ministry that they will be able to roll out the food security legislation by only June and August, 2015, respectively.
Paswan said that Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have assured that they will be able to roll out food security legislation by April, 2015.
“In Haryana, only less than 10% computerisation of TPDS has been done. In Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka, no mechanism has been put in place for door step delivery of ration supply, while Madhya Pradesh has not yet completed Aadhaar card coverage,” Paswan said.
In October, the government had deferred the country-wide rollout of the NFSA, 2013 by another six months, to the first week of April 2015, because of states’ inability to create requisite infrastructure and identify beneficiaries.
This is the second time the government has deferred the pan-India roll-out of the Act, which envisages providing highly subsidised foodgrains to 84 crore people. The food security legislation was passed in Parliament in July last year and states were given a year’s time to complete the roll- out.

GOSF 2014 begins  Google anticipates multi-fold trafficTaslima Khan      Follow @KhanTaslima    Last Updated: December 10, 2014  | 17:30 IST
Google's Great Online Shopping Festival (GOSF) kicked off on Wednesday after a glittering launch ceremony in Gurgaon.
The event, which will run from December 10 to 12, allows brands to offer their best deals on www.gosf.in for 72 hours.
The number of brand partners for the event has jumped up significantly since Google launched the event in 2012. While total brand partners were around 90 in 2012, in 2013 they were 270 and the number has jumped to 450 for GOSF 2014.
Traffic on GOSF website and partner websites is expected to see a huge surge since last year. This is reflected in the response to the pre-party event launched by Google, 14 days back. By the end of the third day itself, GOSF has crossed five million users. In 2013, about two million users logged on to gosf.in. Across all the partner sites, combined traffic had crossed over 16 million users and most players witnessed about 350 per cent growth in daily sales.
Hours after GOSF went live at midnight, e-commerce portal ShopClues witnessed a huge upswing. Within the first 90 minutes, the website saw a 200 per cent uptick in traffic and close to 250 per cent increase in sales. "In three hours, we had done sales for nearly 3 regular days on the site," said Sanjay Sethi, Co-Founder & CEO, ShopClues.com in a statement.
The core objective of Google's initiative, like that of Flipkart's 'Big Billion Day' held on October 6 this year, is to get more and more new internet users to turn online shoppers and amass first-time buyers in one go for e-commerce companies. That's specifically important for India because there is huge headroom for growth in the number of online buyers.
Two years back in 2012, when Google hosted its first GOSF, India had only 8 million online shoppers, though the number of internet users totaled 150 million. The number of online buyers is expected to rise to 100 million which will be larger than that of any large country.
This year, several brands such as HP, Lenovo Group, Tata Housing Development Co, Van Heusen, Motorola Nexus and Karbonn Mobiles have launched their products exclusively at the festival.
Among the list of exclusive launches are two from Google itself: Chromecast and Nexus 6. Chromecast is a pen-drive looking device that can bring all the entertainment viewed on smart phones and other devices on to the television screens. The device which has already been launched in 25 other countries, will be available for Rs 2,999 and will be available on Snapdeal.
Rajeev Das, Head of Marketing and Product Development at Tata Housing, launched a housing project, The Cascades, located in Bangalore. Tata Value Homes, a project located at Boisar near Mumbai with a starting price of Rs 16 lakh was launched at the event. Tata is taking bets on the online platform to drive sales. "While about 25 to 30 per cent of customers are booking homes online, about 70 per cent of our leads, a number of them from NRIs (Non Resident Indians) are being generated online," said Das.
Brands that are participating in exclusive launches are quite upbeat about sales picking up.
"Google has been able to create the buzz and excitement around the event. We think we are invested into the future and will see how it works," said Bimalendu Tarafdar, General Manager, Marketing at Madura Fashion and Lifestyle which is participating for the first time in the Google event.
Van Heusen, a brand from the Madura Garments Family, launched its Stellar Collection of apparels at the event, which will be available on Trendin.com, the official store for all Madura Garments brands. Van Heusen designed the Stellar Collection for an exclusive launch on GOSF.
GOSF has also launched the Rs 299 offer with deep discounted products, free shipping and cash on delivery options to grab first time buyers. Brands that will participate in this include Philips, JBL, Benetton etc.
While most e-tailers including biggies like Amazon, Snapdeal, Shopclues and Jabong have hitched on to Google to see a jump in sales, India's largest e-tailer Flipkart has decided to stay away from the festival.
Some brands, however, have launched products exclusively on Flipkart even though it is out of Google's sale initiative.
Ganaraj Kamath, the National Product and Distribution Manager at Lenovo launched The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 Pro, which will be available exclusively on Flipkart for Rs 49,000.
The site which had been participating in GOSF for the last two years is set to compete with Google by offering discounts on its mobile app from December 8 to 12. The shopping fest hosted by Flipkart will be called Big App Sale. However unlike its 'Big Billion Day' in October this year, Flipkart has not spend heavily on advertising and marketing of the Big App Sale.
"Flipkart staying out won't matter because the phone will be available on Google's Playstore as well," said Amit Boni, General Manager at Motorola India who launched Nexus 6 at the event.
However there are questions around the support infrastructure being well-equipped to handle the surge in traffic during such big sale events. Last year, Google India's GOSF website crashed within minutes of the opening and the sale had to be extended by a day.
Similarly, Flipkart's 'Big Billion Day' faced multiple issues especially with order fulfillment and logistics, because of which customer service took a big hit. Couriers were jammed because logistics companies faced capacity issues and couldn't handle the rush.
 
India's e-commerce economy appears dwarfed when compared to that of China. Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba sales totaled $9 billion on its 'Single's Day' held on 11th November this year. The event came less than eight weeks after Alibaba's record $25 billion public listing in New York this year.
Compared to that, the biggest such event by an e-tailer, Big Billion Day, organized by Flipkart this year on October 6, led to the site getting a billion hits on the day, achieving $100 million (Rs 615 crores approximately) in sales in 10 hours.
Rajan Anandan, Managing Director, Google India, said: "The measure of  the success of GOSF will be the number of new users buying online." He added: "India needs many more such events."
Vivek Jayaraman, Global Product Manager at Google India, said the scale of the India market is yet very small as compared to China and customers need to be handled very differently. "While for most countries ecommerce is an evolution, here in India it is yet a revolution," said Jayaraman. "Things like cash-on-delivery, which Indians love, are not heard anywhere else in the world."

Gold prices jump by Rs 650  Rs 1 600 gain for silverUpdate: Gold prices jump by Rs 650 on strong seasonal demand, global cues

Gold prices on Wednesday soared by Rs 650 to Rs 27,470 per ten gram in the bullion market in the national capital on strong seasonal demand and firm trends in overseas markets.
A fall in rupee value against the US dollar and increased buying by jewellers and retailers amid ongoing wedding season lifted prices of gold , bullion traders said.
A cheaper rupee makes gold imports costlier. The rupee was trading weak at 62.05 against the US dollar at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market.
The precious metal's prices surged over US $28 to a six-week high of US $1,238.32 an ounce in New York on Tuesday as weakening of the Greenback and retreat in global stock markets raised demand for gold as an alternative investment.
On similar lines, silver prices also rose sharply by Rs 1,600 to Rs 38,400 per kg on increased off-take by industrial units and coin makers.
Silver prices climbed up by 5.2 per cent to US $17.12 an ounce in New York on Tuesday.
In the national capital, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity zoomed up by Rs 650 each to Rs 27,470 and Rs 27,270 per ten grams respectively. It had gained Rs 170 on Tuesday.
Sovereign traded Rs 100 higher at Rs 23,800 per piece of eight gram.
Following gold, silver ready spurted by Rs 1,600 to Rs 38,400 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 1,815 to Rs 38,615 per kg. Silver coins shot up by Rs 1,000 to Rs 63,000 for buying and Rs 64,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Rampal s lover spills the beans on his sex rompsEYE BROWSE
Rampal's lover spills the beans on his sex romps
Startling allegations about his sexual habits, and the sources of funding and donations that his ashram received, are coming to the fore during interrogation.
Mail Today –  Wed 10 Dec, 2014

NEW DELHI: 'Godman' Rampal’s ungodly secrets are spilling out like an unclogged drain as his once-faithful sadhvis sing before the Haryana Police.
Startling allegations about his sexual habits, and the sources of funding and donations that his ashram received, are coming to the fore during interrogation.
Sources told Mail Today that Rampal preferred ‘hostesses’, whom he called sadhikayaen, inside his private mansion. Of these, only a few were allowed to enter his bedroom as his alleged sexual partners.
Babita Kumari alias Baby, 27, was reportedly his preferred bed mate. Unconfirmed reports said she used to stay in the room of Rampal’s son. The exact nature of her relationship with the Sant’s son is not clear. But this proximity to both father and son gave her power over Rampal in a way other hostesses could not exercise.
Babita is the daughter of Baljit, a Rampal aide, who was arrested on November 20 from the Barwala-based Satlok Ashram.
Sources said Rampal had even made a fixed deposit of Rs 10 lakh in her name. Police sources said Babita acted as Rampal’s henchwoman and knew of all his wrongdoings as well as those of his aides, including her father Baljit.
“We had arrested Rampal’s key aide Baljeet and his daughter Babita. A special team including cyber experts is busy examining her laptop, six mobile phones, 10 hard disks, 17 CDs, three telephone diaries and five files,” Haryana DGP S.N. Vashisht said.
Police sources said Babita was very close to Rampal and knows many of his secrets. She had removed the hard disks from the ashram’s computers and tried to destroy them. Sources also said that Rampal did not allow anybody to enter his room when Babita was with him. They would spend hours together locked inside a closed room.
The police have also recovered a pregnancy kit from Rampal’s room, besides medicines for improving vitality.
CLOSE AIDE
“Yes, she was close to the baba but it is too premature to comment on the relationship between her and Rampal as the matter is under investigation. She was on a three-day police remand which has been extended for three more days. We are investigating all aspects of the case,” Inspector General of Police, Hisar Range, Anil Kumar Rao told Mail Today.
During her interrogation, Babita had reportedly told the police that she has details about all sadhikayaen (hostesses). She has assured the police she will give them the list and get the hostesses arrested.
Sources said the arrest of other sadhikayaen (hostesses) may open a Pandora’s box. Earlier investigations have revealed that Rampal had given a few women access to his private room. There are rumours that these women followers were sexually abused by Rampal’s aides.
Unconfirmed reports also said that some women were found without clothes roaming inside the ashram during a police raid - following Rampal’s arrest on November 20 - and had later alleged exploitation.
The victims, sources said, mostly belonged to Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
Rao, however, denied any Rampal follower was found without clothes and said no such complaint about sexual exploitation has been made so far. However, he said the police will take appropriate action if a formal complaint is lodged by any women follower.
“That is not true. We have not received any complaint about physical exploitation. We will take action if a formal complaint about sexual assault is made. I reviewed the case today and have found some followers with criminal record. They belong to other states and have even given wrong identities. We will take them on remand,” Anil Rao said.
Sources told Mail Today that Babita, her father Baljit, and another Rampal aide have made startling revelations about Rampal and his ashram which the police are unwilling to share at the moment.

Working on preparing a small bank licence application
Vikram Akula, founder and former Chairperson of SKS Microfinance, will pick up 26 per cent stake in Vaya Finserv Private Ltd., a financial inclusion start-up.
The start-up company has also appointed Mr. Akula as Chairman of the start-up company, Vaya said in a release.
Vaya is a business correspondent that facilitates savings and loans for self-help groups of women on behalf of banks.
The company was founded by former SKS Microfinance executives, and opened its first branch in July. It has now 23 branches with 183 employees across six districts of eastern Maharashtra and northern Karnataka.
“Now that my three-year non-compete period is over, I was looking to get back to financial inclusion,” said Mr. Akula, adding, “I chose to join Vaya because it is focused on under-banked districts, it has a great team, and it uses a next-generation technology platform that will become the future of financial inclusion.” 
“We are working with our advisors on preparing a small bank licence application,” said Mr. Akula.
“Vaya is the first business correspondent to use tablet banking in the field. The field officers’ tablets connect to a centralised online system that has the ability to interface seamlessly with core banking systems to ensure daily cash settlement with partner banks,” it added.
The Reserve Bank of India had released final guidelines for small banks and payment banks on November 27 and sought applications by January 16 from those interested in applying for a small bank licence.
Mr. Akula said Vaya was also having an option to apply for payments bank licence.
In terms of strategy, Vaya is focused on under-banked areas. Other than Mr. Akula, investors in Vaya include individual high networth investors, SKS Trusts and Vaya employees.

When a woman s choice to love and live becomes her death wishprint
Bhawna Yadav died three days after she married Abhishek Seth.
Sonu Kumar and Danista loved each other but hate triumphed. Kumar, a young Dalit craftsman in a village in Uttar Pradesh's Hapur district, and Danista, a Muslim, married against their families' wishes. They were hacked to death in broad daylight by Danista's brother on November 29.
 
Danista's family, it was reported , was against Kumar because he wasn't a Muslim. 
Bhawna Yadav, a Delhi University student, was allegedly strangled to death by her parents and cremated secretly just three days after she married her boyfriend who belonged to a different caste. Yadav's parents, before killing her, allegedly accosted her for 'dishonouring' the family when they had fixed her marriage with a man of their caste. 
A strong communal whiff emanates in Sonu and Danista's killings and caste prejudice marks Bhawna's murder, but what binds both the grotesque crimes together is the working of a mindset that's uncomfortable with a woman expressing her freedom to love and make love with whoever she wants.
 
Danista and Bhawna Yadav's families could not even reluctantly accept, leave alone respect, the choices made by their daughters. "The denial of autonomy to women and the idea of 'controlling our daughters' are very much prevalent in Indian society. It often manifests itself through, among other aspects, casteism and religion-based discrimination," says Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association (AIPWA).
 
Film and reality TV star Gauahar Khan was slapped by a man who wanted to teach her a lesson for wearing a short skirt. The man claimed that crimes against women will decrease if actresses stop wearing short dresses. The assault is nothing compared to the three murders, but again shows patriarchal intolerance. 
 
Compare the assault on Khan to a Hindu Mahasabha politician branding actresses who dance to the tune of 'item songs' as "prostitutes". The comment has been termed as 'regressive' by political parties and the National Commission for Women (NCW).
 
"The attack on Gauahar Khan or the referring to actresses who dance to item songs as prostitutes, both reflect the same ideology. Religious orthodoxness comes in to deny autonomy to women," Krishnan says. "The saddest part is that today's dominant politics openly aims at denying autonomy to women."
 
The consequence of a woman exercising her individual freedom to choose and live life as she wishes can be harsh, ranging from a mere slap to brutal murder.
 
"In Indian society prevalent cultural codes are often written on women's bodies and any kind of subversion in terms of behaviour, dressing, or relationship is dealt with very harshly," says Anjali Monteiro, professor and dean, School of Media and Cultural Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai.
 
"Right to choose, right to decide and even right to public spaces are getting increasingly restricted for women. And the problem is such restrictions are often normalized by the actions and comments of people in power--sections of politicians, judiciary and police," says Monteiro.
 
LOVE, KISS AND JIHAD
 
Women's right to autonomy clashes with 'love jihad', a term used by some political and religious leaders to describe  relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women as an alleged strategy aimed at conversion and long-term demographic change.
 
"Love jihad is trap of Muslim organisations to seduce Hindu girls, to use Hindu women for physical desires, to convert them, to sell them or to use them for terrorist activities," says an article in the Organiser, the mouthpiece of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh, the ideological guide of BJP. 
 
'Love jihad', says novelist and poet Meena Kandasamy, assumes that women are incapable of thinking for themselves.
 
Intolerance for the idea that women can think, love or marry by their own choice came to the streets during the 'Kiss of Love' movement. Men joining the protest in Delhi "were repeatedly asked if they would 'let their mothers/sisters/wives to kiss in public".
 
A Facebook post summed up the reply : "Yo, will you give me your sister to kiss?
 
If she feels like kissing you I have no need to interfere. But she should feel like kissing you. The kiss must be welcome to both parties. Otherwise, if you pile on and try to kiss her you might end up measuring the thickness of her slippers. If you are prepared to receive that in front of everyone, come on over. If you feel brave enough to kiss with mutual consent then come on over."

India agrees to cut stakes in state banks; could raise $1.6 trillionDec 11, 2014 at 07:40am IST
India agrees to cut stakes in state banks; could raise $1.6 trillion

New Delhi: The Cabinet approved plans to raise about Rs 1.6 trillion ($25.76 billion) by selling some of its stakes in state-run banks by 2019, a government statement said on Wednesday.
The government holds stakes ranging from 56 per cent to 84 per cent in 27 state-run banks. They account for 70 per cent of total outstanding loans of about $1 trillion in Asia's third-largest economy.
The state-run lenders are estimated to need as much as $60 billion in capital over the next four years to meet new global regulations and to build a buffer against rising bad loans.
The government holds stakes ranging from 56 per cent to 84 per cent in 27 state-run banks.

"While permitting banks to raise capital from the market, the banks would be advised to preserve the government holding at minimum 52 per cent," the statement said, adding the banks could phase in sales of shares in the market.
Cutting the government stakes would substantially reduce the requirement to provide for injections of capital into public-sector banks, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha told Parliament.
While the government has in the past funded the state lenders - by about $13 billion over the past decade - it is now striving to reduce the capital injections to lower its budget deficit.
The government said it would need to put Rs 788.95 billion ($12.70 billion) into the banks over the next four years to maintain 52 per cent stakes. It could get nearly Rs 345 billion ($5.56 billion) as dividends.
Analysts say bigger state-run banks have a better chance of raising capital from the market. They remain sceptical that smaller lenders can attract investors.
Indian state-run banks have been burdened by high levels of bad debt and by corporate governance issues. An RBI-appointed panel this year recommended the government cut its stake in state lenders to less than 50 per cent.

Delhi high court stops sale of Xiaomi phones in India

New Delhi, December 11, 2014
First Published: 10:12 IST(11/12/2014)
The Delhi high court in an interim order has restrained Xiaomi as well as online e-commerce site Flipkart from selling in India handsets of the Chinese mobile maker that run on the technology patented by Ericsson.
 
The court has also restrained Xiaomi or its agents from making, assembling, importing or offering for sale its devices which are infringing the mobile phone technology patented by Ericsson.
 
Justice GP Mittal directed the customs authorities to prevent import of Xiaomi phones that are infringing the patents of Ericsson and if any consignment is imported, the same be informed to Ericsson and its objections be decided as per the Intellectual Property Rules.
 
"I am satisfied that plaintiff (Ericsson) has made out a prima facie case for grant of ad interim injunction in its favour. The balance of convenience also lies in favour of plaintiff and in the absence of an injunction order, plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and injury," the court said.
 
It also issued summons and notice to Xiaomi and Flipkart and directed them to file an affidavit disclosing the number of devices - that are AMR, EDGE and 3G compliant - sold by them in India till date.
 
They have to also indicate in the affidavit the revenue earned by selling these devices till date.
 
The court has also appointed three local commissioners to visit the premises of Xiaomi and Flipkart where the devices are stored in order to inspect and collect documents as well as seal the infringing mobiles.
 
The total fees of the local commissioners, amounting to Rs. 3.5 lakh shall be borne by Ericsson apart from travel and stay expenses, it said.
 
The local commissioners have to submit their report within four weeks, it also said.
 
The order was passed on the plea of Ericsson that Xiaomi has been violating its eight patents pertaining to AMR, EDGE and 3G technologies in the field of telecommunication.
 
Ericsson has said that it had invited Xiaomi to use its patented technology by obtaining a licence, but instead of doing so, the Chinese manufacturer launched its devices in India in July 2014.

The Cabinet Wednesday cleared a proposal for setting up of a Rs 500-crore Credit Guarantee Fund for Factoring for MSME units.
Factoring is a financing arrangement for suppliers by making pre¬payments against invoices. This provides liquidity to MSMEs and facilitates collection of receivables. India`s factoring volume is below Rs 20,000 crore.
"The corpus of the fund is Rs 500 crore. Assuming a leverage of five times of the corpus, gross factoring transactions would cover Rs 20,000 crore per annum at the end of fifth year," an  official statement said after a meeting of the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The corpus is estimated to be Rs 492 crore at the end of fifth year, it said, adding, in the third year of operations, a mid-term review of the fund may be undertaken and propose modifications.
The Factoring Regulation Act, 2012 provides the legal framework for factoring. The Reserve Bank RBI has issued guidelines. However, there is no insurance for factoring.
According to the statement, the Department of Financial Services (DFS) will be "the Settlor" and will establish a Fund for guaranteeing factored debts.
"The Fund should be under "National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company (NCGTC). It will have a Management Committee consisting of Secretary, DFS as the ex-officio Chairman. The convenor of the Management Committee will be nominated by the Settlor. The Management Committee shall be responsible for all policy aspects of the Fund," it said.
Credit guarantee cover for a maximum of 50 percent of factored debt will be provided under the Fund. To start with, only transactions covered under the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 are to be included, it said.
The actual interest rate to be charged from the MSMEs will be left to Factors, it said.
"The key elements of the structure have been proposed based on very preliminary data in the sector. These may require to be revisited and will be done with the approval of FM," it added.

Russia to supply 12 nuclear reactors to IndiaRussia to supply 12 nuclear reactors to India
Reuters | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 02:20 PM IST
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin got straight down to talks on Thursday on boosting nuclear and defence cooperation at a summit aimed at reviving an old friendship that has faded over the years.
Putin's one-day visit to India comes at a time when Russia is at odds with the West over Ukraine, and its economy is stalling as oil prices tumble to their lowest in five years.
The tension over Ukraine intruded on the choreographed visit when it emerged that the leader of Crimea, the former Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia, had travelled with Putin to India for unofficial talks to enhance trade.
India does not support Western sanctions against Russia, but the Crimean leader's presence may prove an irritant before US President Barack Obama visits India next month.
Modi, elected by a landslide six months ago, is expected to give Obama a far more lavish reception as chief guest of India's Republic Day celebrations than Thursday's formal summitry.
Yet Moscow's eye has wandered too since its Soviet-era romance with New Delhi. Bilateral trade, at $10 billion, is now one-ninth of that between Russia and China - the focus of Putin's pivot away from an increasingly critical Europe.
"Russia is a tried and trusted friend - a country that has helped us in times of trouble," an Indian official told Reuters. "But that friendship hasn't delivered in terms of its economic potential."
The two leaders presided over the signing of a "vision" document setting out a roadmap for cooperation over an extended period, with the most ambitious area nuclear energy.
Russia's state-owned Rosatom said that under an agreement signed on Thursday it would supply 12 nuclear energy reactors for India over 20 years.
A 1,000-megawatt reactor is operating at the Russian-built Kudankulam power station in south India, with a second due onstream in 2015. Putin had been pushing for Rosatom to increase the number of reactors it could supply to as many as 25.
Indian officials say a total of six reactors will be built at Kudankulam, with a further six to follow at a site that has not yet been determined.
Other strategic deals were expected to cover oil exploration and supply, infrastructure and an increase in direct diamond sales to India by Russian state monopoly Alrosa.
On defence, the two sides will seek to move ahead with long-delayed projects to develop a joint fifth-generation fighter jet and a multi-role transport aircraft.
A spokesman for India's foreign minister said he was not officially aware of Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov's visit.
Gul Kripalani, a Mumbai businessman who met the Crimean leader at a New Delhi hotel as head of the Indian-Crimean Partnership, told Reuters the talks were unofficial and Aksyonov had "happened to be on the flight with His Excellency President Putin".
Western countries imposed sanctions against Russia over the annexation of Crimea in February and the Kremlin's support for an uprising by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Rupee Slips to 62.34/Dollar, Lowest in Nearly 10 Months
Agencies | Updated On: December 11, 2014 14:38 (IST)
Rupee Weakens to 63.50 as Share Losses Hurt
The Indian rupee slipped to 62.34 per dollar on Thursday, its weakest level in over nine months since February 20. This is the fourth straight session of weakness for the rupee.
A sharp selloff in domestic equities and strength in the greenback pushed the rupee down, analysts said. The momentum of buying in domestic equities by foreign institutional investors has also slowed, which is also weighing on the rupee, analysts added.
The BSE Sensex and the broader Nifty were down for the fourth session in five on Thursday.
Moses Harding, group CEO and chief economist at SREI Infra tweeted, "Rupee found support at end Dec'14 $ at/above 63.50 (spot at 63.30-63.35) from risk-off exporter $ supplies; focus now at 62.10-62.35/62.50."
As of 2.08 p.m., the rupee traded at 62.27 per dollar, down 25 paise or 0.40 per cent against its Wednesday's close. Traders cited likely intervention by the Reserve Bank of India for the rebound.

Google News to close in Spain due to intellectual property lawRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
Google Inc has said that it will shut down Google News in Spain because of a new law that will force it to pay news outlets whose content it publishes, partially or in whole.
Google News will close in Spain on December 16 because of the law, which takes effect in January.
“Sadly, as a result of a new Spanish law, we’ll shortly have to close Google News in Spain,” Google News director Richard Gingras wrote on a company blog.
“This new legislation requires every Spanish publication to charge services like Google News for showing even the smallest snippet from their publications, whether they want to or not,” Gingras wrote.
“As Google News itself makes no money (we do not show any advertising on the site) this new approach is simply not sustainable,” he added.
The Spanish measure is part of an intellectual property rights law that was adopted by parliament in October.
Google News’ closure comes as no real surprise, as the company had made a threat to this effect as the bill made its way through the Spanish legislature.
Google Inc argued then, and repeated in its latest statement, that its news site drives readers to Spanish web sites and thus helps them generate advertising revenue.
Google Inc is facing pressure from publishers in several European countries, who accuse the online search titan of taking advantage of its dominant position in the market and are demanding payment for use of their content.

Audi to launch 10 new models in India next yearAudi plans to launch 10 new models in India next year
By PTI | 11 Dec, 2014, 02.46PM IST
Tweet
The company, which today launched compact convertible Audi A3 Cabriolet in India priced at Rs 44.75 lakh, currently sells 17 models in the country.
NEW DELHI: German luxury car maker Audi plans to launch around 10 new models next year in India as it looks to further consolidate its position in the country.
The company, which today launched compact convertible Audi A3 Cabriolet in India priced at Rs 44.75 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), currently sells 17 models in the country.
"Next year we plan to launch around ten products in the Indian market. It is going to be an exciting and busy year for us," Audi India Head Joe King told PTI.
Elaborating further he said the products would be the combination of new variants of existing model range as well as products catering new segments.
Terming 2014 as the company's best year so far in India, King said it has already surpassed last year's sales figure and is set to further enhance its market share in the luxury segment.
Besides, the company is also preparing to bring in more investments into the country, he added.
"We are looking to bring in next round of investments into the country, keeping in mind the immense long term potential of the Indian market," King said.
He, however, did not share further details. Commenting on the A3 Cabriolet launch, King said the compact luxury segment is growing the fastest in the luxury car industry and the introduction of compact convertible will further strengthen the company's dominance in this space.
The four seater car comes with a lightweight soft top, sporting a 1.8 litre petrol engine with a top speed of 242 km/h.
"First showcased at the Auto Expo this year, the car received an overwhelming response from customers which prompted us to introduce the product in India," King said.
In 2013, Audi sold 10,002 units in India, becoming the first luxury car maker to cross the 10,000-unit milestone and stay as the number one ahead of German rivals Mercedes (9,003 units) and BMW (7,327 units).
Earlier this year, the company had launched the A3 sedan in India. It is the first model from the Audi stable to be locally produced before being launched in India.
Other models, such as sedans A6 and A4; SUVs Q5, Q7 and Q3 which are locally produced now were imported as completely built units (CBUs) at the time of launch.
The annual capacity at VW group firm Skoda's Aurangabad plant for all Audi models is more than 14,000 units in a one-shift operation.

(Earlier this year Snapdeal had…)
NEW DELHI: In its first acquisition after USD 627-million Softbank fund infusion, e-commerce major Snapdeal has acquired Wishpicker, an online gift retailer founded by IIT-Delhi graduates.
The acquisition amount for Wishpicker, which was founded last year itself by IITians Apurv Bansal and Prateek Rathore, was not disclosed.
"We are investing in strengthening our technology platform and Wishpicker.com is an excellent platform with top-tier entrepreneurial, engineering talent and fits in perfectly with our vision," Snapdeal Co-Founder Rohit Bansal said today.
Wishpicker claims to provide "gift ideas from across the internet" through intelligent gift recommendation engine. It uses parameters like relationship with the recipient, age and personality for suggesting gifts.
Bansal said as consumer buying trends are evolving, intelligent recommendations will be one of the key drivers for business volume for sellers.
This is the company's first acquisition after Japanese telecom and Internet giant SoftBank invested USD 627 million in the homegrown online marketplace in October.
Overall, this is Snapdeal's fifth acquisition since inception. Snapdeal had earlier acquired Bangalore-based group buying site Grabbon.com (June 2010), esportsbuy.com (April 2012), Shopo.in (May 2013) and Doozton (April 2014).
"This is an important acquisition for us in terms of adding new technology capabilities and helping sellers connect with buyers in newer ways," Bansal said.
With over 30 million members and more than 50,000 sellers, Snapdeal.com delivers products to 5,000 cities and towns in India.
Snapdeal has received funding from several global marquee investors like Softbank, BlackRock, Temasek, eBay, Premji Invest, Intel Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Ratan Tata, Nexus Venture Partners and Kalaari Capital among others.
Snapdeal had said it would use the investments from Softbank to expand its chain of fulfilment centres and make acquisitions in the coming few months, specifically in the area of mobile technology.
Co-founder Kunal Bahl had told PTI: "Snapdeal is looking at acquisition opportunities across sizes, ranging from less than USD 1 million to USD 100 million."

Would you eat this new Bulgarian candy that s also a deodorantWould you eat this new Bulgarian candy that's also a deodorant?

Deodorant sweets made by Bulgaria's Alpi factory. (AFP)
There are sprays, roll-ons and sticks. Now one Bulgarian candy-maker is offering a new kind of deodorant: in the form of delicious sweets.
"It's an old saying that true beauty comes from inside.... Why not from a candy?" Ventsislav Peychev, owner of Bulgaria's small Alpi candy factory owner, told AFP.
He claims his Deo Perfume Candy can neutralise body odour and replace it with a lingering sweet scent for up to six hours, depending on a person's size and how many sweets they have gobbled up.
The sweets -- which look like typical bonbons and are available in hard, chewy and even sugar-free versions -- are based on research by Japanese scientists who found that a major component of rose oil, geraniol, was not broken down by the body but excreted through the skin. Bulgaria, the European Union's poorest country, is a major producer of rose oil.
"Geraniol is an antipode of garlic.... It also comes out through the pores but instead of leaving a bad smell, it perfumes the body," said Peychev.
Awarded a bronze medal at the Geneva Exhibition of Inventions in 2011, and a technical innovation award at the SIAL food exhibition in Paris this past October, the deodorant candy, selling for $5.98 (4.81 euros) a pack on amazon.com, is already on sale in the United States, Asia and several European counties.
Although the concept is not new, Peychev's product is the only one on the market now after a Japanese manufacturer stopped making its Otoko Kaoru chewing gum based on the same idea.
 
Does it work?
 
Each piece of Peychev's candy contains three milligrammes of geraniol-rich rose or lavender essential oil, which apparently men prefer.
"This quantity is enough for the smell to last for six hours depending on the body mass of the consumer, an average of 65 kilos. Heavier people should eat more candies -- two, three, four," said Dimitar Hadzhikinov, a professor at the Plovdiv University of Food Technology who helped Alpi develop the candy.
The effect is quicker with the soft and sugar-free candies, which dissolve more easily in the mouth. And since all the ingredients are natural, there's no need to feel bad about eating a few more than necessary, according to Hadzhikinov.
An AFP correspondent who stuffed herself with the bonbons said she did smell even more sweetly than usual afterwards, although not one exactly of roses. A whiff also remained long after the taste of the candies had gone.
Whether the candy -- priced at about two leva (one euro, $1.30) for a packet of 20 on the Bulgarian market -- will find a large audience remains to be seen.
George Preti, a chemist with the Monell Chemical Senses' Center in Philadelphia, told AFP it was difficult to judge if such products worked as their makers "seldom, if ever, present any analytical or clinical data to support their claims of deodorancy."
No previous edible or chewable deodorant product appears to have succeeded in getting much of a hold on the market, he added.
But this will not stop Peychev, who views functional foods not only as a business but a passion.
The lively 55-year-old former engineer previously developed an energy candy with caffeine and guarana, a cooling sweet with vitamins and calcium, and a slimming one with a soluble dietary fibre called inulin.
His company Alpi, in the southern town of Asenovgrad, now employs about 40 workers and churned out 500 tons of sweets last year, with a turnover of two million euros.
Financially at least, things are smelling sweet.

Vladimir Putin  Narendra Modi in push to revive jaded Russia-India relationshipIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
Prime Minister Narendra Modi told President Vladimir Putin on Thursday that Russia will remain India’s top defence supplier, even though New Delhi’s options had improved since the end of the Cold War.
Modi spoke after a one-day summit that sought to revive a relationship that peaked in the Soviet era, while the two sides signed billions of dollars in deals covering nuclear power, oil and defence cooperation.
In the most significant ones, state-owned Rosatom will build 12 nuclear reactors in India, energy major Rosneft  inked a 10-year crude supply deal with Essar Oil and Russia promised to build advanced helicopters in India.
“Even if India’s options have increased, Russia remains our most important defence partner,” Modi, 64, told reporters after the first formal summit between the leaders since Modi won election by a landslide in May.
Putin’s visit comes as the Kremlin grapples with a sliding oil price and weak economy that have deepened the impact of Western sanctions over its annexation of Crimea last spring and support for an uprising in eastern Ukraine.
The tension over Ukraine intruded on the choreographed visit when it emerged that the Russian-backed leader of Crimea had travelled as part of Putin’s delegation for what were billed as unofficial talks to enhance trade.
“We highly appreciate the friendship, trust and mutual understanding with Indian partners,” said Putin who touched on bilateral issues chiefly in his statement to journalists. No questions were allowed.
VISION
The two leaders presided over the signing of a “vision” document setting out a roadmap for cooperation in the sphere of nuclear power. Putin said Russia could eventually supply India with 20 nuclear reactors.
In the event, state-owned Rosatom said that under an agreement signed on Thursday it would supply 12 nuclear energy reactors for India over 20 years.
A 1,000-megawatt reactor is operating at the Russian-built Kudankulam power station in south India, with a second due  onstream in 2015.
Indian officials say a total of six reactors will be built at Kudankulam, with a further six to follow at a site that has not yet been determined.
Other strategic deals covered oil supply, infrastructure and an increase in direct diamond sales to India by Russian state monopoly Alrosa.
On defence, the two sides will seek to move ahead with long-delayed projects to develop a joint fifth-generation fighter jet and a multi-role transport aircraft, in addition to the advanced helicopter cited by Modi.
CRIMEAN COMMOTION
A spokesman for India’s foreign minister said he was not officially aware of Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov’s visit.
But Gul Kripalani, a Mumbai businessman who met the Crimean leader at a New Delhi hotel, told Reuters the talks were unofficial and Aksyonov had travelled to India as part of Putin’s delegation.
Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia over the annexation of Crimea in February and the Kremlin’s support for an uprising by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.
HIGHLIGHTS
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin got straight down to talks on Thursday on boosting nuclear and defence cooperation at a summit aimed at reviving an old friendship that has faded over the years.
Putin’s one-day visit to India, at which a raft of agreements were signed, comes at a time when Russia is at odds with the West over Ukraine, and its economy is stalling as oil prices tumble to their lowest in five years.
Here are some of the key announcements:
ENERGY
* Russia’s state-owned Rosatom will supply 12 nuclear energy reactors to India over 20 years, under an agreement aimed at boosting nuclear energy ties between the two countries.
* India’s Essar Group signed a deal with Russian oil producer Rosneft to import oil.
* Russian bank VTB will open a $1 billion credit line to Essar Group, chief executive Andrei Kostin said.
* The Russian Direct Investment Fund will team up with an Indian infrastructure financing company, IDFC, to invest $1 billion in hydroelectric projects in Asia’s third-largest economy.

LS adjourned on Muslims conversion issueIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
Opposition today created uproar in Lok Sabha over the issue of religious conversion in Agra, prompting the government to say it was ready to build a consensus on having a legislation on conversion.
As soon as the House met for the day, Opposition members belonging to Congress, TMC, SP, RJD and AAP came to the Well demanding suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue of alleged religious conversions and re-conversions.
Speaker Sumitra Mahajan declined to suspend Question Hour, saying she would allow Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge to speak during Zero Hour and if necessary allow a discussion.
Her repeated pleas did not yield any result and the opposition continued to protest and raise the slogan ‘Hindu, Muslim, Sikhs bhai bhai’.
While members belonging to NCP, AIMIM and Left parties kept protesting from aisle, the Question Hour continued with most of the questions being taken up.
Acknowledging that it is a serious issue, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said, “Government is ready to discuss and build a consensus on having a legislation on (religious) conversion.”
Kharge said the matter should be taken up as a special case. “It is a very, very serious matter and there is threat to the unity of the country,” he said.
He said religious conversions are happening and everybody is giving statements outside the House and even encouraging such things.
Countering the allegation, Naidu said, “There is no problem to safety, unity and integrity of the country… Don’t politicise the issue.”
SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav also spoke something which was not audible.
As the din continued, the Speaker said proper notice should be given as the government has already expressed its willingness to discuss the matter.
“You are interested in slogans only, you are not interested in discussions… This is not the proper way,” she told the protesting members.
With the Speaker not accepting the opposition demand, Kharge wondered whether the discussion should take place on the streets.
As the pandemonium continued, Mahajan adjourned the House for 10 minutes till 12.05 PM.

Google named world s best company to work forGoogle named world's best company to work for
ANI | Washington Dec 11, 2014 03:33 PM IST
Glasdoor has named Google as the top company to work for in its list of 50 best places to work.
Glassdoor's CEO Robert Hohman said that list saw non-technology companies moving up in the rankings this year as Bain and Company occupied the second spot, Nestle Purina PetCare stood third, F5 Networks followed on the fourth spot and Boston Consulting Group stood fifth, reported Fox News.
Hohman said that the list was the most diverse that the company had ever seen.
He remarked that while "vanity benefits" like free food and on-site gyms or massage therapists are all well and good but benefits that affect families, like longer paternity and maternity leave, are more meaningful.
Google has recently increased its paternal and maternal leave policies and reworked its onsite daycare program, he said.

No one really knows how long Ebola can live:StudyBy: Press Trust of India | Washington |
Posted: December 11, 2014 4:10 pm
No one really knows whether the deadly Ebola virus can survive on glass surfaces or counter-tops or how long it remains active in water, waste water, or sludge, new research has found.
“The World Health Organisation has been saying you can put (human waste) in pit latrines or ordinary sanitary sewers and that the virus then dies,” said Kyle Bibby of the University of Pittsburgh in US.
“But the literature lacks evidence that it does. They may be right, but the evidence isn’t there,” said Bibby.
Bibby and colleagues from Drexel University explain that knowing how long the deadly pathogen survives on surfaces, in water, or in liquid droplets is critical to developing effective disinfection practices to prevent the spread of the disease.
Currently, the World Health Organisation guidelines recommend to hospitals and health clinics that liquid wastes from patients be flushed down the toilet or disposed of in a latrine, researchers said.
However, Ebola research labs that use patients’ liquid waste are supposed to disinfect the waste before it enters the sewage system.
Bibby’s team set out to determine what research can and can’t tell us about these practices.
The researchers scoured scientific papers for data on how long the virus can live in the environment. They found a dearth of published studies on the matter.
“That means no one knows for sure whether the virus can survive on a surface and cause infection or how long it remains active in water, wastewater, or sludge,” researchers said.
The team concluded that Ebola’s persistence outside the body needs more careful investigation.
The study was published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters.

("We are looking for NRIs who…)
SINGAPORE: Cash-rich NRIs, who can invest in India for up to 20 years, are critical components for the transformation of the country and developing its economy, a top executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers said here today.
NRIs should take part in the development of Indian economy over the longer-term and provide their wealth and technology knowhow, Shashank Tripathi, executive director at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in Mumbai, said here at the launch of the PwC report - "Future of India - The Winning Leap".
"We are looking for NRIs who are not sprinters but marathon runners, who can keep in touch with India over a period of 10-20 years," Tripathi said.
He also urged the NRIs to get their children and prodigies re-connect with India for they are part of the Indian heritage.
"It has to be economic, emotional and cultural bond," said Tripathi.
Observing that the new government is also moving fast to rectify the tax regimes and making it more business friendly, Tripathi said, "The government is doing everything possible to have the NRI's feel welcome."
Yet, he also called on the NRIs to understand various challenges for working in a large country like India where legal system varies from state to state.
Tripathi also pointed out that the Indian government was now working on plans to offer incentives, especially for the manufacturing sector under the 'Make in India' intiative.
Investors should take all opportunities to participate in the manufacturing sector to which government would give pioneer status as it has done so for the IT sector 20 years ago, he said.
It was PWC's first international launch of the report, an in-depth study on India's ability to share prosperity for its 1.25 billion citizens by transforming the way economy creates value.
The report was first launched in India last month.

Nathuram Godse as much a patriotic as Mahatma Gandhi: BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj40
0
New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party Unnao MP Sakshi Maharaj sparked a controversy on Thursday by saying that Nathuram Godse was as much a patriot as Mahatma Gandhi.
He said, "Nathuram Godse as much a nationalist as Mahatma Gandhi. Godse was a nationalist and Gandhi did a lot for India."
Gandhi's assassin Godse is being eulogised in Maharashtra. The Congress said, "Godse bravery day is being observed in Maharashtra."
#bjp #sakshi maharaj #nathuram godse #mahatma gandhi
The issue was raised in Rajya Sabha which witnessed uproarious scenes with members from Congress lodging strong protest against eulogising of Nathuram Godse at a function held in Maharashtra earlier this month.
Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Husain Dalwai (Congress) said he has written to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis over hosting the event attended by some religious leaders and former MLAs. "Mahatma Gandhi's killer is being eulogised by hosting his 'Shaurya Diwas' in Maharashtra... These people talk of development, but are trying to create a rift in society," he said, accusing the right-wing organisations of indulging in such things, including religious conversions that created tension in society.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, "This is not acceptable. Mahatma Gandhi's killer, whosoever it may be, we are against it...We do not accept any honour of Mahatma Gandhi's killers."
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said, "There is no question of eulogising such a person. We should leave the matter there, but defaming an organisation is not acceptable."

Indira Gandhi was not aware of Emergency provisions: Pranab Mukherjee19
0
New Delhi: The then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was not aware of the Constitutional provisions allowing for declaration of Emergency that was imposed in 1975 and it was Siddartha Shankar Ray who led her into the decision, says President Pranab Mukherjee.
Ironically, it was Ray, then Chief Minister of West Bengal, who also took a sharp about-turn on the authorship of the Emergency before the Shah Commission that went into 'excesses' during that period, according to Mukherjee.
These details are revealed by the President in his book "The Dramatic Decade: the Indira Gandhi Years" that has just been released.
These details are revealed by the President in his book "The Dramatic Decade: the Indira Gandhi Years" that has just been released.
#new delhi #indira gandhi #emergency1975 #siddartha shankar ray
"It is believed that Siddartha Shankar Ray played an important role in the decision to declare the Emergency: It was his suggestion, and Indira Gandhi acted on it.
"In fact, Indira Gandhi told me subsequently that she was not even aware of the Constitutional Provisions allowing for the declaration of a state of Emergency on grounds of internal disturbance, particularly since a state of Emergency had already been proclaimed as a consequence of the Indo-Pak conflict in 1971," says Mukherjee in the book.
Interestingly, though not surprisingly, once it was declared, there were a whole host of people claiming authorship of idea of declaring the Emergency.
And, again not surprisingly, these very people took a sharp about-turn before the Shah Commission.
"Not only did they disown their involvement, they pinned all the blame on Indira Gandhi pleading their own innocence. Siddartha babu was no exception. Deposing before the Shah Commission, he ran into Indira Gandhi draped in a crimson sari that day in the Commission hall and tossed a sprightly remark: 'You look pretty today'.
'Despite your efforts,' retorted a curt Indira Gandhi, says Mukherjee in his 321-page book that covers various chapters including the liberation of Bangladesh, JP's offensive, the defeat in the 1977 elections, split in Congress and return to power in 1980 and after.

India s ties with Russia incomparable: ModiIndia's ties with Russia incomparable: Modi
Agencies | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 04:08 PM IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday Russia will remain India's top defence supplier, even though New Delhi's options had improved since the end of the Cold War.
Modi was speaking after talks with President Vladimir Putin aimed at revitalising ties that have focused on the import of defence equipment. Even in that area, India has increasingly turned to countries such as the United States and Israel for its military modernisation programme.
"Even if India's options have increased, Russia remains our most important defence partner," Modi told reporters. He said Russia had also offered to manufacture an advanced helicopter in India.
Modi said that "we have met twice at the opposite ends of the world - at Brazil and Australia".
He recalled that President Putin and then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee launched the annual summit process in 2000.
The prime minister said the two countries have "a strategic partnership that is incomparable in content". He added that Russia has been "a steadfast supporter" even in difficult moments of history.
Russia is most important defence partner and "we have conducted joint military drill of the three wings in the last six months", said Modi .

Deloitte yet to give final report on Coal India restructuringDeloitte yet to give final report on Coal India restructuring
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 03:40 PM IST
Consultancy firm Deloitte, which was selected to institute a study on restructuring options for state-owned Coal India, is yet to submit its final report, Parliament was informed today.
"Ministry of Coal has instituted a study on restructuring options for Coal India Ltd (CIL) by engaging Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Pvt Ltd ... The consultant has not submitted the final report after taking into consideration the concerns expressed by the coal companies on the interim report," Coal and Power Minister Piyush Goyal said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.
The consultant had submitted its interim report in October which was discussed with coal companies and CIL, the minister said.
In the interim report, the Consultant had broadly suggested three restructuring options, including reforming holding company and subsidiaries through internal changes in structure, systems and roles and creating independent mega regional companies, Goyal said.
Goyal added that the consultancy firm had also suggested phased creation of independent entities with continuation of holding company during transition.
In the same Interim report, he said, Deloitte had also suggested restructuring model of Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Ltd (CMPDIL), a subsidiary of CIL with the options like "CMPDI as an autonomous body under MoC (Ministry of Coal).

Mega road projects see jump in cost after GVK s exitRoad project cost jumps as NHAI invites fresh bids
Mansi Taneja | New Delhi Dec 12, 2014 12:40 AM IST
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has, after a delay of almost three years, invited bids for the Shivpuri-Dewas road project in Madhya Pradesh that was earlier awarded to GVK Transportation.
Rebids have been called in three packages in the design, build, finance, operate, transfer (DBFOT) model at Rs 3,500 crore. When the contract was awarded to GVK Transportation in January 2012, the value of the project was Rs 2,815 crore, according to a senior NHAI official.
The project is for widening 333 km of the Shivpuri-Dewas section of NH3 to four lanes. It will be executed in three parts: Shivpuri-Guna at a cost of Rs 849 crore for 97.7 km, Guna-Biaora at Rs 1,074 crore for 93.5 km and Biaora-Dewas at Rs 1,609 crore for 141 km. In the DBFOT model, a developer operates a road project for a specific time to recover investment and earn profits before transferring it to the government.
The government is planning to tender out smaller stretches of highways to save time and avoid delays.
“It is always easier to manage award of small stretch of highways, rather than a big one. This will also ensure speedy execution of the project,” a senior official from the roads ministry said.
 
The project was first awarded to GVK Transportation in January 2012 but was later terminated by NHAI due to company’s failure to achieve financial closure for the project. However, even before NHAI terminated the contract, GVK had walked out of the project citing delays in getting various clearances.
 
GVK had moved the High Court to restrain NHAI from encashing its bank guarantee. The Court directed both to decide the matter through an arbitration process, which is now underway and also asked NHAI to keep in abeyance encashment of bank guarantee till the disposal of the case. 
 
Meanwhile, the company has renewed its bank guarantee for another year and the case is under arbitration now.
NHAI had served termination and debarment notices on GVK Transportation for its failure to tie up funds for the project and issued a show-cause notice issued in May this year telling the company that there was “no merit or cogent ground” in the company’s submissions for non-achievement of financial closure and fulfillment of other condition precedents. In the notice, NHAI had said the company had unilaterally terminated the agreement with the government for the project in January 2013 on the grounds that there was a change of law (force majeure) for environment clearances. NHAI, however, said it did not consider the requirement of green clearance for lease of less than 5 hectare area as a change of law since it was done through a mere clarificatory order of the Supreme Court.

BSE Sensex falls 229 pts to 6-week low of 27 602.01; RIL  ONGC lead declineBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai |
Posted: December 11, 2014 11:55 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 4:59 pm
After a day’s breather, Indian stocks continued their downslide today with benchmark Sensex tumbling 229.09 points to six-week low of 27,602.01 on sharp losses in RIL and ONGC after further drop in crude oil price.
Similarly, the 50-issue CNX Nifty of the NSE also plunged by 62.75 points, or 0.75 per cent, to end below 8,300-mark for the first time after one and half months at 8,292.90.
In line fall in local equities, the Indian rupee fell to nine-month low levels of 62.3 against the greenback.
Weak Asian trends on the back of overnight steep fall on Wall Street amid slow down in capital inflows weighed on the stock market sentiment here.
Besides Oil&Gas, realty, IT, power and banking counters also suffered heavy losses while only some of the defensive pharma stocks attracted some buying interest.
Besides RIL and ONGC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, TCS, Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Gail India suffered marked losses.
Brent crude oil fell to five-year low below USD 65 a barrel, putting pressure on oil companies.
The BSE 30-share barometer resumed lower on weak Asian cues and moved in negative terrain throughout the day before concluding at 27,602.01, a fall of 229.09 points or 0.82 per cent. This is its weakest close since 27,346.33 on October 30.
Yesterday, Sensex had snapped a three-day falling trend as it recovered by about 34.09 points or 0.12 per cent.
“Weak Asian markets and fresh fears from Euro region kept Indian markets volatile. Mixed sentiments on the back of weak rupee and lower oil too added to the volatility. FII liquidity outflow on the back of profit booking too added to weakness,” said Hiren Dhakan, Associate Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio.
Investors were also cautious ahead of the release of Consumer Price Index-based inflation and Index of Industrial Production scheduled on Friday.
A total 11 out of 12 BSE sectoral barometers ended in the red. Market breadth was weak as about 1,750 stocks fell, 1,139 rose and about 100 ended flat.
Bucking the overall weak trend, sugar stocks were in limelight after government fixed higher price for ethanol procurement by PSU oil firms.

Russia remains Indias important defence partner  says PM Narendra Modi; both countries sign key nucleardealWritten by Shubhajit Roy | New Delhi |
Posted: December 12, 2014 12:06 am | Updated: December 12, 2014 9:27 am
Unitedly opposing economic sanctions that do not have the UNSC’s approval, India and Russia on Thursday sought to strengthen their “special strategic partnership” by announcing a clutch of agreements in energy and defence, including Moscow’s help in building at least 12 nuclear reactors and a plan to manufacture advanced Russian military helicopters and defence spare parts in India.
Unveiling a “Druzhba-Dosti” vision statement for the next decade after a four-hour long meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pitched for “at least 10 more (nuclear) reactors” with the highest standards of safety. “It will include manufacture of equipment and components in India. This also supports our Make in India policy,” he said.
A strategic vision document on nuclear power signed on Thursday said both sides would strive to complete the construction and commissioning of “not less than 12 units” in the next two decades, in accordance with the 2008 agreement. Towards this objective, the Indian side agreed to expeditiously identify a second site, in addition to Kudankulam, for the construction of the Russian-designed nuclear power units in India.
“We have just signed a document of great significance — the strategic vision for strengthening Indian-Russian cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear power. It contains plans to build over 20 nuclear power units in India, as well as cooperation in building Russia-designed nuclear power stations in third countries, in the joint extraction of natural uranium, production of nuclear fuel and waste elimination. This will lay the foundation for our long-term mutually beneficial cooperation in the nuclear sector,” said Putin.
Russian government officials said Moscow has “in principle” agreed to the Indian nuclear liability law, factoring in the costs involved in the process. This led to the signing of the supplement to the General Framework Agreement (GFA) for Units 3 and 4 of Kudankulam nuclear power project between Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and Atomstroyexport on Thursday.
The issue of nuclear liability has been dogging the sector, as the American and French firms have not been able to overcome the issue. This has prevented the US and French nuclear firms from starting work on setting up the nuclear power projects in the last five years.
Stressing that Russia would remain India’s most important defence partner “even if India’s options have increased”, Modi said, “We discussed how to align our defence relations to India’s own priorities, including Make in India… Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters. It includes the possibility of exports from India. It can be used for both military and civilian use. We will follow up on this quickly.”
He also proposed that Russia should locate in India manufacturing facilities for spares and components for its defence equipment. “He responded continued…

(RIL gave the name of Rix,…)
NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries has named former UK judge Sir Bernard Rix as its arbitrator in the KG-D6 cost recovery dispute with the government in place of former Chief Justice of India S P Bharucha who quit last week.
RIL gave the name of Rix, who recently retired as Lord Justice of Appeal with 20 years experience in the Commercial Court and the Court of Appeal , earlier this week, sources privy to the development said.
He will sit on a three-member arbitration panel headed by Supreme Court-appointed neutral arbitrator Michael Kirby, a former Judge of an Australian High Court, to decide if the government was right in disallowing over $ 2.3 billion of KG-D6 cost as output lagged targets.
The government has named former Chief Justice of India V N Khare as its arbitrator on the panel.
Sources said Bharucha recused himself from the arbitration after the government challenged his nomination saying that he had not disclosed all previous associations with RIL and that his arbitration could create doubts about his independence and impartiality.
The arbitration which dates back to November 2011 is yet to start as procedural issues were raised.
RIL had challenged the government notice to disallow cost through a Notice of Arbitration on November 23, 2011 saying the signed contract does not provide for output targets and there was no provision for disallowing any part of cost because of production not being in line with output guidance.
The government initially did not join the arbitration within the stipulated 30 days as provided under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) but relented after RIL moved Supreme Court for appointment of the second arbitrator.
However, Justice (rtd) Bharucha and Justice (rtd) Khare failed to agree on the name of the third presiding arbitrator for 13 months and RIL again moved the Supreme Court on August 8, 2013.
Earlier this year, former Australian judge Michael Hudson McHugh was named as the presiding arbitrator but he withdrew after government counsel objected to his remaining on the panel after initially refusing to accept the appointment.
The Supreme Court in September appointed retired judge Michael Kirby of Australia as chairman of arbitral tribunal.
Sources said the government raised objection to Justice Bharucha after two and half years after his appointment.
RIL says it had made full disclosure of all previous dealings with its Arbitrator.
The company had filed a separate arbitration notice on May 9 over delays in approving revision in KG-D6 gas price. For this arbitration, RIL named Sir David Steel and the government named Justice GS Singhvi as their arbitrators.
The two have failed to agree on a third arbitrator and RIL has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking such appointment.

MUMBAI: Billionaire brothers Shashi and Ravi Ruia run-Essar Group singed two pacts with Russian firms to secure two of its key requirements—crude oil and finance, as a part of the co-operation pacts singed between the two countries during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to New Delhi.
Russian bank VTB will open a $1 billion credit line to Essar Group. In a separate agreement, Rosneft agreed to supply oil and oil products to Essar refineries in India in a deal valued at $ 10 billion.
"We are very happy to partner Rosneft, a global leader in hydrocarbon reserves and production, for long term supply of crude oil and products. This provides good long term raw material security to our refineries," said Essar's Chairman Shashi Ruia.
Rosneft would supply 10 million tons of crude to Essar for 10 years beginning 2015.
Moscow-based Rosneft's Chairman Igor Ivanovich Sechin said, "The performance of the terms of the agreement will have a substantial impact on the scale of economical cooperation between Russia and India - our company estimates that the implementation of the contract will fuel significant growth in the goods turnover between two countries."
Rosneft is 69.50% owned by the Russian government, while BP owns 19.75%, and the remaining 10.75% of shares are publicly traded. It has interest in hydrocarbon exploration and production, refining, upstream offshore projects, and crude oil and marketing.
Essar Group has diversified interests in oil exploration and production, steel production, power and shipping. Essar Energy has increased its refining capacity to 741,000 barrels per day from 260,000 barrels per day, which included expansion and upgradation of it Vadinar refinery. The financing deal with VTB is intended to finance the continued consolidation of assets in Essar Group's investment portfolio and strengthening of their capital structure. This agreement follows the $ 1.2 billion transaction arranged in first half of 2014 by VTB Capital, which acted as financial adviser and financier for the company in delisting Essar Energy from the London Stock Exchange.

No report from US embassy about Delhi s poll...Delhi Government
(Rijiju was answering…)
NEW DELHI: Government today denied having received any report from the US embassy about Delhi's air pollution level, but admitted that air quality deteriorates during Diwali.
"The government has not received any such report from US embassy at Chanakyapuri in New Delhi," Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said during Question Hour in Rajya Sabha.
On behalf of Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar , who is now in Peru, Rijiju was answering a question on whether US embassy's pollution monitor here showed very unhealthy pollution levels in the national capital.
"However, as per newspaper reports quoting US embassy's website, it was claimed that the air in Delhi was very unhealthy on October 29, 2014 on the standards of Air Quality Index (AQI) which is followed in USA. Indian standards for monitoring air quality are comprehensive and different from that of USA," he said.
Admitting that air pollution escalates in Delhi during Diwali, Rijiju said the Delhi government runs anti-cracker campaign through eco-clubs in schools and undertakes public awareness.
"Ambient air quality is monitored in Delhi by Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Central Pollution Control Board during Diwali festival every year," he said.
In this regard, he said government was committed to implementing the direction of National Green Tribunal that vehicles over 15 years old should not run in Delhi.
He also said government has taken various measures to contain air pollution in Delhi such as supply of cleaner fuels, use of beneficiated coal in thermal power plants of Delhi and promoting public transport.
Replying to a separate question, Rijiju said government was not contemplating amending any provision of the Forest Rights Act that requires prior consent of Gram Sabhas before their forests are cleared for industrial activity.
He said in case of a deviation in the Act, it would be taken care of by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, which pilots the Act.
Trashing reports about moves to amend the Act, he said it could be because of "some confusions and perceptions."
Meanwhile, to a query on India's stand on climate change, he said India and other developing nations were of the view that developed countries must fulfill their commitments under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and "India is not deviating from its position."
Under the convention, developed countries were supposed to provide resources to developing countries to enable them to undertake actions for mitigation and adaptation arising out of climate change.

The producer asked to deposit Rs.3 crore in the bank account of the Registrar through online transfer by Thursday evening.
The Madras High Court Bench in Madurai on Thursday permitted ‘Rockline’ Venkatesh, producer of Rajinikanth-starrer Lingaa, to release the movie on Friday on condition that he deposit Rs.5 crore, besides providing a bank guarantee for an equal sum to the credit of the Registrar (Administration) of the Bench.
A Division Bench of Justices V. Dhanapalan and V.M. Velumani ordered that the movie be released by 1 a.m. Friday, the actor’s birthday, if the producer could deposit Rs.3 crore in the bank account of the Registrar through online transfer by Thursday evening. The rest of the money as well as the bank guarantee could be handed over by Monday.
The order was passed on a writ appeal filed by an aspiring filmmaker, K.R. Ravi Rathinam, alleging theft of his script for making the movie. Holding that the appellant could not invoke the writ jurisdiction of the High Court to redress his grievance, the judges gave him four weeks to initiate civil as well as criminal proceedings before the lower courts.
However, “in the interest of justice and taking into consideration the principles of equity, justice and good conscience,” the Bench directed the film producer to deposit Rs. 10 crore as a pre-condition for permitting the release of the movie. Assuming that the film was scheduled for release on Friday afternoon, the judges initially ordered him to deposit the entire sum at least an hour before the release.
When Sanjay Ramaswami, counsel for both Mr. Venkatesh and Mr. Rajinikanth, objected to the imposition of such a condition and asked “what about our equity” Mr. Justice Dhanapalan replied: “Letting you release the movie is the equity for you. You can take the matter on appeal to the Supreme Court if you want. But this is our order. We will not change it.”
In the post-lunch session, senior counsel R. Muthukumaraswamy requested the court to give at least a week to the producer to make the deposit. Accepting his plea partly, the judges ordered that Rs.3 crore be deposited on Friday and the rest be given to the Registrar, along with the bank guarantee, on Monday.
A few minutes after the order was modified and subsequent to a conversation with his clients on the phone, Mr. Ramaswami represented the matter once again before the judges and wanted to know if the movie could be released at 1 a.m. Friday. But the judges made it clear that it should not be released without Rs.3 crore being deposited in cash or by demand draft or through online transfer.
When counsel sought the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) number of the court’s bank account to make the online payment immediately, the judges asked him to coordinate with the Registrar who, in turn, was directed to deposit the entire sum in an interest-bearing account in the Indian Bank branch on the court campus until further orders.
Later in the evening, the Registrar told The Hindu that the producer had transferred Rs.3 crore to an official account of the court at State Bank of India. “I shall deposit the money in the Indian Bank branch on our campus tomorrow as directed by the court,” he said.

PORT LOUIS, Dec 11:  
Mauritius voters rejected plans to grant more powers to the president by handing an unassailable lead in a parliamentary election to a coalition that rejected changing the constitution, according to television reports on Thursday.
The coalition of the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) and the Parti Mauricien Social Democrate (PMSD) had secured 44 of the 62 contested seats by 2.50 p.m., while the ruling Labour Party and its ally which backed the change had just 13.
Labour, led by Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam, and its ally the Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) called for power to be divided between the president, now a largely ceremonial role, and the premier, who currently holds sway.
The MSM-PMSD argued that those constitutional changes could unsettle the Indian Ocean island nation, which has been one of Africa's most stable democracies since gaining independence from Britain in 1968.
The electoral commission is expected to announce the final official result later on Thursday. In addition to 62 contested seats, the commission will allocate eight more to ensure adequate representation. In Wednesday's vote, 74 percent of the eligible 936,975 voters cast ballots.
Labour's coalition said the constitutional change, requiring a three-quarters majority in parliament, would make the nation of 1.3 million people more democratic because power will not be concentrated in one person.
Mauritius has a growing financial centre and also relies on its tourism, textiles and sugar industries.

Oil Country Tubular to relocate certain manufacturing facilities
Our Bureau
Tweet
Hyderabad, Dec 11:  
Oil Country Tubular Limited has decided to relocate some of the manufacturing facilities to a convenient location, possibly in Andhra Pradesh near Nellore, keeping in view the stir by employees, future expansion and proximity to port.
The board of directors of the company, which met here today, reviewed the company's operations and noted the issue relating to workers striking work illegally in a concerted manner without any notice or reasonable cause, resulting in disruption in the manufacturing operations.
The company, which is into oil exploration equipment and services, has a manufacturing unit at Narketpally in Nalgonda district of Telangana near Hyderabad.
Sridhar Kamineni, Managing Director of the company, informed the BSE that partial operations are continuing with the engineering staff.
The board said the levy of liquidated damages by customers were due to the delay in the supplies. The supplies were affected due to the illegal strike by the workmen. This has impacted the performance and the profitability during the year.
Under the circumstances, the company is cautious in accepting orders from customers as the orders are predominantly delivered abroad.
In the statement, the Board said it discussed the prevailing power shortage and other operational factors and decided that the company should look at options to relocate certain facilities which can immediately go into operations in a short period. The relocation is also keeping in view the future expansion and the availability of power, water and infrastructure in close proximity to the sea ports.
Recently, the company management raised the issue of strike by a section of employees unions, which has caused damage to the company business and prospects. Citing this, it had indicated its intent to relocate the factory. The board decision endorses that thinking.
The company closed the last financial year with revenues of Rs 358 crore. Oil Country shares ended at Rs 38, down 1.30 per cent, on the BSE on Thursday.

Rupee slips from 2-week high; down 6 paise at 61.83 against USDcurrency values
The rupee fell from its two-week high on Monday and ended 6 paise down at 61.83 against the Greenback on fresh dollar demand from importers amid weak equities.
The local currency was also dragged down as the US dollar was trading at its highest level in over five years against a basket of major currencies, buoyed by a surprisingly robust employment data.
Fresh capital outflows as well as renewed dollar demand from oil companies amidst some caution ahead of the inflation data based on Wholesale Price Index also added pressure on the local unit, a Forex dealer said.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex), the domestic unit resumed sharply lower at 61.94 as against last weekend’s closing level of 61.77.
It drifted further to touch an intra-day low of 61.98 before regaining some ground from earlier nervousness to finish at 61.83, posting a fall of 6 paise, or 0.10 per cent.
The rupee had recovered 15 paise to close at two-week high of 61.77 against the dollar on last Friday.
Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex plummeted sharply by 1.19 per cent or 339 points — its biggest one-day fall in nearly eight weeks.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth Rs 109.45 crore on last Friday, as per provisional data.
The dollar index, which measures the Greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was marginally up by 0.04 per cent after hitting a peak of 89.53, the strongest level since March 2009.

Should you bother saving for collegeShould you bother saving for college?
By Anya Kamenetz, Tribune Content Agency The Savings Game
New York University
I ran into an old acquaintance recently outside a coffee shop with his two adorable young children. Both he and his wife work part-time, freelance schedules, leaving the whole family of four free to wander downtown Manhattan on a beautiful Friday. Their conversation centered on the benefits of second-language immersion, getting into the right preschool and securing a mortgage on a home in a good school district. But despite their devotion to full-time parenting, both of them freely admitted that saving for college was not part of their plan. "We just can't afford it," the wife said. "Fifty thousand dollars a year? Are you crazy?" the husband added.
They're not alone. Saving for college has declined shockingly since the great recession, according to a national survey by Sallie Mae. The percentage of parents with kids under 18 who put aside money specifically for college has dropped from 62 percent in 2009 to 51 percent in 2014.
In a separate recent survey, a whopping two-thirds of parents said they hadn't begun saving for college because they just can't afford it. In fact, one in three are still paying off their own student loans.
0
The conventional financial wisdom is to dig deep and save anyway. But I think the picture is more complex than that.
The despair that many parents, like my acquaintances, feel is based on eye-popping sticker prices at a handful of marquee institutions, like NYU and the members of the Ivy League. Real costs for real families are far below that, yet they still feel out of reach.
According to Sallie Mae, the average amount in a college savings fund is just $15,000. Meanwhile, net price at a four-year public university for an in-state student, living in the dorms, is $12,620. And if current trends continue, the cost of college will almost certainly grow faster than your savings do, if they're placed in a safe investment vehicle such as bonds or CDs.
If you're in a top tax bracket, with no debt, other assets and a lot of disposable income, yes, it's a no-brainer to save for college. There are tax benefits to using a 529 education savings account. And your child is less likely to be eligible for any need-based aid.
However, if you're living closer to the bone, paying off your own debt, building up an emergency fund and stashing away money for retirement -- in that order -- have to take precedence over saving for kids' college. There are subsidized loans and grants available to pay for school, but not for your retirement or health care costs.
That said, it's only the very lowest earners who can count on federal need-based grants to pay for college. The vast majority of Pell Grant recipients come from families at less than two and a half times the poverty line.
So what to do?
I believe in saving for a child's education, but not necessarily in the traditional sense. If you have limited funds, there are two places where I think an investment in your kids' educational attainment can go the farthest.
The first is investing in any enrichment necessary to ensure that your child is performing on grade level all through school. This has a cumulative effect that is crucial for college success, not to mention merit-based scholarships and aid. Many point to third grade as a major milestone for reading skills, while algebra is the single subject that stops most students from getting a college degree.
The second is helping to build up an emergency savings cushion for your kids to draw on once they're in college. (Kids can and should contribute to this fund once they start working). Several studies and pilot programs show that small cash grants and gestures like a free transit pass can be extremely helpful in keeping students on the path to graduation -- and when some of that support comes from parents, it shows that you have their backs. There are cases where a little really does go a long way.

Schwing Stetter India, on Wednesday, announced its foray into material handling industry. The expansion will see the ready-mix concrete equipment maker selling towers cranes of XCMG, a China-based global construction equipment maker that has now majority control of Germany-headquartered Schwing group, in the Indian market.
The plan to sell XCMG’s tower cranes, which will be able to lift heavier loads, comes on the back of a rising demand for mechanisation of construction activities in high-rise projects in the country. “We found an opportunity to fill a gap in this industry, which has only a very few players.
“There is no pan-India player in this category. Also, this foray provides us a synergy as we have been working with a number of builders across the country. So, this existing customer base presents a huge opportunity to sell tower cranes,” Anand Sundaresan, Vice-Chairman & Managing Director, Schwing Stetter India Pvt Ltd., said here.
It has unveiled two products – 5-tonne (with free standing height of 35 metres) & 6-tonne (45 metres) tower cranes. These products will be priced at Rs.60 lakh and Rs.90 lakh, respectively.
V G Sakthikumar, Managing Director, Schwing Stetter Sales & Services Pvt Ltd., the sales and service arm for all products of the group in India, said the company would import the cranes in the initial period. But, it would focus on producing it locally with higher localisation as early as possible.
Total size of tower crane market is estimated at 700 units a year. Schwing aims to sell 50-100 units of its new cranes in the first year.

Cheap gas! What’s not to love? Don’t tell that to a group energy companies suffering a crash that’s reaching a historic level to the magnitude of the dot-com crash and Great Recession.
Plunging oil prices are clearly bad for most energy companies. But small energy companies are taking it especially hard. The S&P SmallCap 600 energy sector is now down 50.5% from its close at the end of June 2014, says Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Such a vicious decline ranks right up there with some of the most ugly market crashes of all time. The Nasdaq Composite, for instance, lost nearly 80% of its value from peak to trough between 2000 and 2002.
Some small energy stocks are already suffering dot-com style beatdowns. Basic Energy Services (BAS) , an oil and natural gas driller, is down 81% from its closing price on June 30, 2014. That’s just plain ugly.
And don’t forget Comstock Resources (CRK) , which is down a crushing 80% from its closing price on June 30. The Texas-based company is an oil explorer.
Some worry that the decline in oil prices will hit some of these small players so hard that it could start to make a serious dent in the market’s overall earnings. During the third quarter, the energy sector generated $11.97 per share of the S&P 500’s total earnings of $30.03, says S&P Capital IQ. That huge piece of earnings is in possible jeopardy if energy prices stay low.

Time names Ebola fighters  Person of the Year  2014Time names Ebola fighters as 'Person of the Year' for 2014
Kiley Armstrong     New York   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 13:50 IST
Doctors, nurses and others fighting Ebola through "tireless acts of courage and mercy" have been named Time's 2014 Person of the Year.
The runners-up included Ferguson, Missouri, protesters; Russian President Vladimir Putin; Kurdish Regional Government President Massoud Barzani; and China-based founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, Jack Ma.
Time's editor Nancy Gibbs on Wednesday praised "the people in the field, the special forces of Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the Christian medical-relief workers of Samaritan's Purse and many others from all over the world" who "fought side by side with local doctors and nurses, ambulance drivers and burial teams."
Gibbs noted that the disease has struck doctors and nurses.
"The rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight," she wrote. They were cited "for tireless acts of courage and mercy, for buying the world time to boost its defenses, for risking, for persisting, for sacrificing and saving."
Antoine Petibon, head of international programs for the French Red Cross, which has been active in Guinea's anti-Ebola efforts, called it "great recognition for all these people who have been toiling in the shadows."
"If it helps us wipe out this epidemic faster, all the better," Petibon added.
The disease has taken its toll in myriad ways.
In September, a team trying to inform villagers about Ebola in the forests of southern Guinea was attacked by a mob. The bodies of eight people - two local administrators, two medical officers, a preacher and three journalists, were found stuffed in a latrine.
Less than a month after arriving in Guinea, Cuban Dr. Jorge Juan Guerra Rodriguez died of malaria.
Henry Gray, MSF operations coordinator for the Ebola response in Guinea and Liberia, said the spotlight should be on the patients and the thousands of people in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Mali "who are doing their best to deal with this horrendous outbreak."
Gray, speaking by phone from Conakry, the Guinea capita, said: "We are happy for this recognition but will be even happier when the last Ebola treatment center is closed and the crisis is declared over."
Birte Hald, head of emergency operations for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said "front-line fighters" deserve recognition.
"People like myself, we are working hard, but we are not at risk," Hald said from Nairobi. "People doing the safe and dignified burials, the contact tracing and the transport of the sick, working in the treatment centers - these are the people who deserve our praise and respect."
White House press secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama and his administration "could not be prouder of the brave men and women who have committed themselves to this effort in a foreign land. ... But we must not forget that in order to bring this epidemic under control on the front lines, indeed the only way to prevent additional cases here in the United States, we need more of these medical professionals."
Christos Stylianides, European Union Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, agreed.
"We urgently need more health workers on the ground," said Stylianides. "The crisis is not over, and will not be unless we scale up the numbers of medical staff, field hospitals, laboratories and humanitarian aid."

The 30-share index ended the day at 27,602.01, down 229.09 points or 0.82 per cent. It touched a high of 27,796.34 and a low of 27,539.47 in trade today.
The Nifty closed at 8,292.90, down 62.75 points or 0.75 per cent. It touched a high of 8,348.30 and a low of 8,272.40 in trade today.
According to analysts, the correction was long overdue after one-way movement on the upside and investors should use these corrections to go long or buy quality stocks at lower levels, because the long-term trend still remains on the upside.
"My firm view is that there should be another 5 per cent correction in the boarder indices by January-end. The Indian markets rose the highest among many comparable markets," says G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research & Advisory Pvt Ltd.
"Therefore, I firmly believe that profit booking should continue from institutional investors, particularly the FIIs," he adds.
With most of the market-moving events (domestic) being behind us, the action might remain muted for the rest of the month as well. However, globally, the most important event poised to strike the Indian markets is the US Fed policy decision.
"We are expecting the markets to probably consolidate in this range. The markets will find it difficult to breach 8,600 with most of the events out of this way," says Mayuresh Joshi, VP-Institution, Angel Broking.
"Nothing much is expected from the winter session of Parliament. So what the markets would ideally look for is the budget and till the budget is probably on, the FIIs are probably going to go off action once the Christmas vacation starts," he adds.
Long-term investors should not get worried even though December has remained by and large a muted month as there is plenty of actions which investors can watch out come January.
"Currently, there are no specific triggers as far as domestic markets are concerned. That is the reason why we are not seeing significant flows coming in. December typically is a dull month in terms of FII activity," says Nipun Mehta, Founder & CEO, Blue Ocean Capital Advisors.
"But there will be significant triggers in January. We will start seeing December quarter results, some of which are expected to be really good. The markets will start looking forward to a potential rate cut and the Budget will be looked forward to," he adds.
 
Mehta do not see an elongated period of consolidation. It could happen for maybe two or three weeks when there are specific triggers missing. Those kinds of dips may come about. But they will only present opportunities to buy, he added.
Sensex still not expensive:
Another reason highlighted by analysts is the fact that the benchmark index is still trading at fair valuations, even though it has rallied over 30 per cent so far in the year 2014.
Global investment bank Credit Suisse in a report earlier this week said that the Indian market is not expensive yet and it will likely pay more for growth going forward.
In a world struggling for growth, India stands out, says Credit Suisse. Economists at the investment bank project India to see the fastest USD nominal GDP growth in 2015, with the growth gap between India and the rest of the world expanding.
Analysts at the top research firm firmly believe that earnings growth for Sensex companies will bounce back as the economy recovers. "We are in the midst of a macro recovery or a U-shaped recovery," say experts.
The current account deficit and fiscal deficit numbers have come well in line. Along with that as the RBI lowers interest rates, the cost of funding will go down for India Inc, which will support growth.
"Year 2015 should be a very good year for India. On a 12-month forward perspective, the Sensex still trades roughly at 15 times, which is still slightly lower than the long-term average. So from that perspective, India is not expensive," says Tirthankar Patnaik, India Strategist, Mizuho Bank.
"My understanding is that the risks for the Indian macro are global rather than local at this point. But one does not know how far crude can go and what sort of correction we will see in the US markets because initially, the drop in crude is welcome, but a sustained drop is not so welcome," he adds.
Investors should deploy buy on dips strategy
Despite the nervousness in global markets, analysts across brokerage firms do not see a sharp sell-off in the Nifty, but a 100-point correction cannot be ruled out. On the upside 8420 remains next resistance level for the index.

Congress protests in Rajya Sabha over eulogising GodseUproar in Rayja Sabha over eulogising Godse
HT Correspondents , Hindustan Times  New Delhi/ Pune, December 11, 2014

Opposition members created an uproar in Rajya Sabha on Thursday against the eulogising of Mahatma Gandhi killer Nathuram Godse at a November 15 function in Maharashtra.
Opposition MPs engaged in a verbal duel with treasury benches, leading to two adjournments. Earlier in the day, BJP MP from Unnao, Sakshi Maharaj, triggered a controversy by calling Godse a patriot. Later, he withdrew his words saying he did not mean it the way it had been interpreted.
Congress leader Husain Dalwai raised the matter in the Rajya Sabha during Zero Hour saying he has already written to Maharashtra CM about the event. He accused certain right wing organisation of holding such programmes and creating communal tension through religious conversions. “These people talk of development, but are trying to create a rift in the society,” he said.
Parliamentary affairs minister Venkaiah Naidu said, “There is no question of eulogising such a person. We should leave the matter there, but defaming an organisation is not acceptable.”
Godse’s kin speaks
Accusing Congress of raising the issue of Nathuram Godse out of ‘political frustration’ Himani Savarkar, a descendent of Godse, said that no outsider was present at the “family function” — held to mark Godse’s birthday on November 15.
Savarkar is the daughter of Gopal Godse, Nathuram’s brother. “It was Congress which banned the release of his testament before the court. Is it not suppression?  My father published Nathuram’s statement with court permission. How will the Congress justify this?” she said, adding that the Congress had raised the topic out of desperation.
“Why did Congress not take any action when it was in power? We are doing it for past 64 years. What is wrong if somebody is thinking of Akhand Bharat?” she asked.

Forget selfies—these gadgets are for serious phone photography.
Daniel Wroclawski
December 10, 2014
With every passing generation, smartphone cameras get better and better. All you have to do is compare the Xperia Z3 , Galaxy Note 4, or iPhone 6 to their predecessors to see how far they've come.
But if you really want the best shot possible, you might want to consider picking up a few extras. After all, the fixed focal length and fragile build of smartphone cameras limit their photographic flexibility. Luckily, you can now find everything from printers to underwater housings for your smartphone, allowing you to use it just about anywhere you bring a GoPro or a DSLR.
Joby GripTight GorillaPod
Availability: Amazon
This little tripod will help you not only stand your phone up, but also attach it to virtually anything—from tree branches to rearview mirrors. The GorillaPod will work with any phone, including its case, and also comes in a slightly larger size designed for phablet owners.
Joby's versatile tripod comes in five accent colors, and there's even a free GorillaCam app for the iPhone. The app offers a range of features including time-lapse video and a bubble level, so you'll never have to rotate a landscape shot again.
Olloclip 4-in-1 Lens
Availability: Amazon
The best smartphones have very good lenses, but none offers optical zoom. You're stuck with a single focal length, and the only other option is digital zoom, which can greatly degrade the quality of your shots.
While there's no way to get DSLR-style lens swapping on your phone, you can attach add-on lenses.
While there's no way to get DSLR-style lens swapping on your phone, you can attach an add-on lens over the camera itself. That's where Olloclip comes in.
Old-school film and digital photographers will be familiar with teleconverters—lens attachments that either widen or narrow your lens's field of view. That's exactly what Olloclip does. Each clip comes with four lenses: a fish-eye, a wide-angle, a 10x macro, and a 15x macro. The macro lenses are built into the Olloclip attachment itself, while the fish-eye and wide-angle lenses can be screwed in when needed.
Olloclip models for iPhone 5 and 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5, and iPad Air and iPad mini are already available. If you've already upgraded to the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, you can place a pre-order.

Agra  conversion  row: Govt says ready for discussion in ParliamentComments
The government offered to bring a law on religious conversion amid opposition pressure in Parliament on Thursday over the Agra controversy and tension in Aligarh and other sensitive areas where hard-line Hindu groups were aggressively pushing ahead their “reconversion” programmes.

“The government is ready to discuss and build a consensus on having a legislation on (religious) conversion,” parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said in the Lok Sabha after Opposition MPs shouted slogans demanding a debate and an adjournment motion on the Agra incident in which 57 poor Muslim families were apparently tricked to switch to Hinduism at a camp hosted by the Dharam Jagaran Samiti and the Bajrang Dal.
The Opposition also demanded an adjournment motion, saying incidents like the one in Agra could ignite riots. “They (organisers of religious conversions) are bringing the country a bad name and sowing seeds of poison,” said Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge.
When Parliament was debating the situation arising out of the Agra incident, an explosive letter surfaced in Agra in which Dharam Jagran Samiti leader Rajeshwer Singh has outlined the target, expenditure and achievement of his organisation to its cadre.
Setting a goal of 50 events this year to convert 100,000 Muslims and Christians, the letter seeks donations to go ahead with its proposed programmes, called ghar wapsi or homecoming ceremonies.
It calls for help from each volunteer to at least fund one event, saying Rs. 5 lakh is required to “reconvert” a Muslim while expenses on problems related to a Christian come to Rs. 2 lakh.
The letter says such ceremonies have “brought back” to Hinduism 40,000 people, including 2,000 Muslims, in 20 districts.
In communally-sensitive Aligarh, the Dharam Jagaran Samiti and the VHP announced their plan to “reconvert” 5,000 Christians and 1,000 Muslims at a function on Christmas.
They said Hindus would be appealed to welcome the “reconverted” Muslims and Christians, who had apparently switched faith from Hinduism some time in history.
Firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, who is the MP for Gorakhpur, and other senior leaders of RSS and VHP offshoots are likely to attend the programme to be held on a college campus.
The Hindu Yuva Vahini that Adityanath had floated, too, has a plan to convert over 2,000 people at a similar programme at Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh on December 18.
Muslim groups and political parties not aligned with the BJP demanded the governments at the Centre and the state to restrain the radical Hindu outfits .
Security in Aligarh was strengthened to prevent any violence. Senior superintendent of police J Ravindra Gaud promised swift action on any complaint of forced conversion.

Mumbai-based Pentagon plans ship-repair hub inGujaratBy: Express News Service | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 11, 2014 4:29 pm
Mumbai-based shipping company, Pentagon Marine Services is planning to set up a ship-repair and maintenance hub in Gujarat that can tap the requirements of 1800 ships that call at the large ports of the state every year.
“There are shipping building and breaking facilities in Gujarat. What the state lacks is a dedicated repair hub. We are looking to acquire 30 acres of land to set up a wet dock that can tap the service requirements of 1800-odd ships that annually call at the ports in the state,” said Captain Nalin B Pandey, CMD, Pentagon Marine Services. The company is currently in the process of identifying land.
The company is already working with the Gujarat Maritime Board and will be signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Gujarat government during the Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2015 in January. “We expect to identify the land by March 2015 and operationalise by 2018. We will be pumping Rs 50 crore in the first phase of the project,” Pandey added.
The proposed facility is initially targetting to service ships of 35000-50000 DWT (Dead Weight Tonnage). ” We are initially targetting to handle about 50-60 ships annually. Painting will be one of the biggest activities that we will undertake. We will also be doing plumbing, welding, carpentry, motor repairs and other services of the ships and vessels,” he said.
Apart from the ship-repair facility, the firm is also looking to set u pa maritime training institute that will offer pre-sea training course to young students on careers in merchant navy, port administration, etc. The company already runs a maritime institute in Mumbai.

Drunk doctor performs family planning operation on five  falls asleep while sixth on operatingtableWritten by Ashwani Sharma | Dharmashala |
Posted: December 12, 2014 12:18 am | Updated: December 12, 2014 4:55 am
In a near-repeat of Chhattisgarh sterilization deaths, a drunk doctor performed five sterilization operations and fell asleep, leaving the sixth patient on the operation table in remote Seraj area of Mandi district, Himachal Pradesh.
All five patients who underwent sterilizations are reported to be safe and were discharged on Wednesday. The sixth patient was later rescued by her family members.
Further operations were suspended for the day as family members of patients came to know about the doctor having performed the operations in a drunken state and had left the sixth patient unattended on the operation table at Primary Health Centre (PHC), venue of the sterilization camp at Thunag, 80 km from district headquarters.
In all, there were 67 women registered for the family planning operation in the camp. Out of them, 30 taken-up in the first batch were administered Atropine Injections .
A batch of six patients were taken into the operation room. Due to the doctor’s drunken state he could perform sterilization on only five before he locked himself in a room and fell asleep, leaving the sixth patient unattended. The patient was already administered anaesthesia.
As the next patient was not called in after a long time, the families of the women grew suspicious and questioned the medical staff. It was only after sometime, the staff informed about the “doctor being unwell and taking rest”.
The issue rocked the Himachal Pradesh Assembly when local BJP MLA Jairam Thakur tabled an adjournment motion in the House. The government ordered suspension of Dr Kapil Malhotra and ordered an inquiry into the episode.
“This is a case of gross negligence of the doctor, whose medical examination later confirmed he being in drunken state. It’s sheer luck that all five women who underwent sterilization are safe and no death or medical complication has been reported,” Health Minister Kaul Singh Thakur informed the assembly.
He said a new team of doctors have reached Thunag and, till 1 pm, 25 more sterilizations had been done successfully. All the patients registered for the family planning operation will be looked after by the government.
The health minister, however, claimed that the doctor in question has a good reputation as a government gynecologist and he had already done hundreds of family planning surgeries. “Yet, the government will not spare anyone indulging in such kind of dereliction of duty in the health services, as it’s question of human lives. We have adopted a policy of zero-tolerance in such cases,” said Kaul Singh.
The government, Thakur said, has ordered suspension of the doctor and asked District Programme Officer Dr Praveen Kumar to hold an inquiry.
Earlier, BJP MLA Jairam Thakur raised questions on the state government’s failure alleging that the doctor in question is known for his drinking habit, and during an earlier sterilization camp he had slept on a patient midway in an operation.

Germany confident India will find practical solution to the languageissueBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 4:59 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 5:09 pm
Germany on Thursday voiced confidence that the Modi government will find a “practical solution” to the issue of dropping German language as an alternative to Sanskrit in central schools.
“I can only tell you that I am and continue to be very confident that India will find a practical solution on this issue,” German ambassador Michael Steiner said.
Government’s move to drop German as an alternative to Sanskrit as a third language in Kendriya Vidyalayas prompted German chancellor Angela Merkel to raise the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G 20 Summit in Australia last month. Modi assured Merkel of looking at it within the confines of the Indian system.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court also asked the Human Resource Development Ministry to consider continuing German for the present academic session .
Centre had stuck to its decision on replacing German as the third language with Sanskrit in Kendriya Vidyalayas but conceded that no exam would be conducted for the subject in the current session.
The HRD ministry decided to bring in Sanskrit in place of German as third language. Over 70,000 students across 500 Kendriya Vidyalayas from classes VI to VIII were asked to switch from German to Sanskrit.
The 2011 memorandum of understanding that made German a third language was signed between the Kendriya Vidyalayas and Goethe Institute-Max Mueller Bhawan.
Sanskrit teachers had moved to the Delhi High Court alleging that the central schools had introduced German as a third language in place of Sanskrit against the education policy.

Congress disrupts Rajya Sabha over attempts to glorify Nathuram Godse; seeks strongactionBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 4:52 pm
Congress Rajya Sabha MP Hussain Dalwai on Thursday strongly condemned the alleged efforts to “glorify” Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse and demanded arrest of those involved in such exercise.
“A person who has created an example of non-violence in the world and whom we called Father of the Nation was killed by Nathuram Godse,” Dalwai said outside Parliament.
“Now some people are observing Nathuram Godse Shourya Diwas on November 15. It is absolutely wrong and the government should arrest them. Why is the government silent on the issue?” he asked.
Dalwai said he has written to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis demanding action against persons involved in “glorifying” Godse.
“Gandhi is accepted by people from all walks of lives including workers, peasants, dalit and women. I have written a letter to the state Chief Minister demanding action against these people,” he said.
Earlier in the day, Rajya Sabha witnessed uproarious scenes with members from Congress lodging strong protest against eulogising of Godse at a function held in Maharashtra earlier this month.
Under attack from the opposition members, Government disapproved of any such event hailing Mahatma Gandhi’s killer
but said no organisation should be defamed.
The Upper House saw two brief adjournments over the issue as Congress members protested holding placards in the aisles and raising slogans, while charging right-wing organisations with lending their support to it.
Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Dalwai (Cong) said he has written to Maharashtra Chief Minister over hosting the event attended by some religious leaders and former MLAs.
“Mahatma Gandhi’s killer is being eulogised by hosting his ‘Shaurya Diwas’ in Maharashtra…These people talk of development, but are trying to create a rift in society,” he said, accusing the right-wing organisations of indulging in such things, including religious conversions that created tension in society.
Congress members created uproar over the issue and raised slogans while displaying placards of the event, even as Deputy Chairman P J Kurien tried to pacify the agitating members, asking them to take their seats and maintain peace.
“Don’t make use of Zero Hour for this kind of display. This is gross indiscipline…To decide the culpability or otherwise, the courts are there, not me or you,” Kurien said.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, “This is not acceptable. Mahatma Gandhi’s killer, whosoever it may be, we are against it…We do not accept any honour of Mahatma Gandhi’s killers.”
As members continued their protest and the House witnessed acrimonious exchanges between both sides, Kurien adjourned the proceedings for 10 minutes just before noon. But, similar scenes were witnessed when the House met at noon, forcing the Chair to adjourn it again for 15 minutes.
When the House reassembled, Anand Sharma (Cong) said, “It is not acceptable that some one eulogises him. I hope neither the House nor the Parliamentary Affairs Minister will approve of such an action. Let the House speak in one voice and condemn it.”
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said, “There is no question of eulogising such a person. We should leave the matter there, but defaming an organisation is not acceptable.” It was after this that normal proceedings resumed.

States oppose GST Bill; compensation, petroleum remain vexed issues

(At a meeting of the Empowered…)
NEW DELHI: In a setback to the Centre, states today rejected the draft Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill saying it does not address their concerns, particularly on entry tax and taxation of petroleum products.
At a meeting of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, the Centre's plan to bring petroleum goods under GST regime was opposed.
They also objected to the the Constitutional Amendment Bill as it does not contain provisions for giving states compensation against any possible loss of revenue after GST roll-out for five years.
"There is no consensus between the Centre and states on these three things (compensation issue, petrol tax and entry tax). The Empowered Committee is not supporting the Bill without these three things," Empowered Committee Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather said after a meeting of the state Finance Ministers.
The central government, he stressed, "will have to respect views of the states."
The states want that the Centre to compensate them for any loss of revenue on implementation of the GST for five years and a clause regarding the compensation be included in the Constitution Amendment Bill, Rather said.
The state governments are also keen on keeping the entry tax and petro tax out of the ambit of the GST.
In a bid to roll out the GST, which would subsume excise and service taxes, the Centre has come out with a new Constitutional Amendment Bill.
"Government hasn't agreed to our recommendations made last time, except one recommendation. We had said that the share of Union government in GST should go to the divisible pool and should be devolved among states , that has been agreed by Centre," Rather said.
Rather said that the draft of the new Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was received by the Committee earlier in the month, did not take on board the suggestions of the state Finance Ministers.
"But we were surprised to know that government hasn't agreed to our recommendations made last time, except one recommendation with regard to putting GST in divisible pool," he added.
However, with regard to petroleum products, entry tax and compensation, he said, "the Government of India has not agreed to our recommendation."
Rather welcomed the decision of the Centre to release Rs 11,000 crore to states as compensation towards the central sales tax (CST) this financial year.
"So far as CST compensation is concerned, we are happy to know that the Centre has agreed to keep a provision of Rs 11,000 crore in the current year's budget...that will settle the claim of CST compensation up to the year 2010-11," he said, adding that the compensation for latter years would be discussed with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
Jaitley announced release of additional funds to the states while replying to a discussion on supplementary demands for grants in the Lok Sabha yesterday.
Clearance of CST compensation arrears has been a bone of contention between Centre and states.
  CST, a tax imposed on the inter-state movement of goods, was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in 2007-08 and further to 2 per cent in 2008-09 after the introduction of Value-Added Tax (VAT). The Centre had then promised the states that it would bear losses due to reduction of CST.
As part of the roll-out of GST, the CST is being phased out and has been reduced to two per cent from the earlier four per cent. The Centre collects CST and distributes it among states.
The GST roll-out has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the proposed new tax regime.

RBI Extends Deadline For Niche Banks' Licensing Spplications
New Delhi: With an estimated three crore people having been identified as homeless, government will soon come out with a scheme to provide housing to all, government said in the Lok Sabha today.
Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said he will shortly take the proposal to the Union Cabinet for its approval and share details with the House.
He said the Narendra Modi government is committed to provide housing to all by 2022.
As part of the efforts, Naidu said, government is also working on integrated housing for urban poor where private sector will also be encouraged to participate. The state governments were being encouraged to provide certain relaxations for the participation of the private sector.
Responding to supplementary questions, he said the government is working on a slum rehabilitation development plan after studying models of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat.
Hailing the Tamil Nadu model, he said the state has shown the way by constructing vertical buildings for the slum dwellers in cities such as Chennai.
He said his ministry would soon move the Union Cabinet to approve the plan where free houses would be provided to slum dwellers on land they are occupying. The private sector will be involved in the redevelopment plan.
Responding to another supplementary, he said a long-term plan is afoot to provide power, water, irrigation and housing for the rural populace and the Rural Development Ministry is working on the issue.
Mr Naidu said following a Supreme Court directive on providing shelter to homeless in winters, he had convened a meeting of chief secretaries of all states to take stock of the situation.
Referring to Delhi, he said work in this regard has been carried out but it is an ongoing process. The DDA was asked to provide 15 plots out of which 12 have already been handed over for shelters.
He said while the land will remain with government, it will be given on lease of Re 1. He, however, did not specify the period of the lease.

American s Dreamliner delivery delayed0
The recent delivery dates were delayed years from the original one, as Boeing ran into design and production problems that resulted in deliveries starting more than three years late. The near-constant delays were so rampant that the plane earned the nickname 7-late-7. Then regulators grounded the plane last year for 100 days because of overheating onboard batteries.
But the Dreamliner generally gets rave reviews from passengers and airlines.
The 787, made mostly of composite material instead of aluminum, is more fuel efficient than planes it replaces.
United Airlines was the first U.S. carrier to get the 787, taking delivery of its first in 2012.
American's Dreamliner will be placed on domestic routes before regularly flying international ones. Whether Chicago will temporarily have service on a domestic route hasn't been announced.
The delivery delay was first reported by The Dallas Morning News.

Chairman James Skinner will become executive chairman of the combined company, Walgreens Boots Alliance. Stefano Pessina, Italian-born nuclear engineer turned drugstore mogul and the executive chairman of Alliance Boots, will serve as acting CEO of the new company, pending a board search for a successor.
Walgreen shareholders are set to vote on the $15.3 billion second step of the purchase of Alliance Boots on Dec. 29. Walgreen expects the deal to close by the end of March.
The pending change caps a tumultuous year for Walgreen, which in August backed off a controversial plan to move its headquarters abroad in an effort to save on taxes. Shares, too, were battered that month after Walgreen revised its 2016 profit targets lower by $2 billion.
After hitting a 2014 high of $76.08 in June, shares have slowly regained ground from the August announcement, closing Wednesday at $68.15. Walgreen stock was up 5.09 percent, or $3.47, in midmorning trading Thursday.
Wasson's departure comes amid reports of Pessina's growing influence in the company that have circulated for months.
"Pessina is pretty much the leader of the company for the most part," said Morningstar senior analyst Vishnu Lekraj.

Pessina joined Walgreen's board in 2012, when Walgreen agreed to buy a 45 percent stake in Alliance Boots, a large European drugstore chain. The deal gave him 7.6 percent of the company's stock.
Since then, Walgreen shareholders encouraged the company to move forward with a corporate tax inversion, which would have moved the company's tax domicile to the United Kingdom and lowered the company's tax rate. But in early August Walgreen said it would keep its headquarters in the Chicago area. At the same time, as a sign of Pessina's influence, several Alliance Boots executives were named to fill out the combined company's management.
"So much of what happens in the boardroom has less to do with operating results than trust and confidence in the CEO," said Michael Levin, an activist investor based in Chicago. "You have to think that the guy from Boots (Pessina) doesn't trust Wasson to execute on the plan properly."
The announcement of Wasson's departure could also mean that the possibility of a corporate tax inversion is back on the table.
"The opportunity for Walgreen to execute an inversion could be reviewed and they could potentially go ahead and do that given that there's a new leadership team and a lot of that leadership team is based out of Europe," Lekraj said.
Wasson joined Walgreens in 1980 as a pharmacy intern while studying at Purdue University's School of Pharmacy. He managed pharmacies in Houston and became regional vice president of store operations.
He took on several executive roles in the Walgreens Health Initiatives division and was promoted to chief operating officer in 2007, a position that traditionally had served as the springboard for Walgreen CEOs-in-waiting. He was named CEO in 2009.
In a statement, Wasson said it was time for new leadership to move the company forward.
"When I became CEO six years ago, I had three goals — to transform the front end of Walgreens drugstores, to advance the role that community pharmacy plays in health care and to find the right partner to take Walgreens global," Wasson said.
But in July, Wasson told the Tribune that he expected to lead the combined company after the merger.
Wasson became CEO when the economy was in a historic downturn and Walgreen had just lost to rival CVS Caremark on a bid to buy a chain of more than 500 West Coast drugstores run by Longs Drug Stores Corp.
Walgreen stock was trading in the low-$20 range, when it had been up to slightly more than $50 two years earlier.
Wasson focused on leveraging the key real estate properties and launched a rebranding campaign that revamped the look and feel of its stores, expanded health care services and enhanced cosmetics counters and fresh food offerings.
He moved regional vice presidents from headquarters offices and into their regions to shift some of the decision-making into the hands of those closest to the business.
Wasson also zoned in on the store's retail pharmacy challenges, from rising drug prices to mounting reimbursement pressures. He launched a blueprint to reinvent the company called the "Walgreens Plan to Win."
In 2010, Wasson spearheaded the acquisition of New York-based pharmacy chain Duane Reade for $1.1 billion and in 2012 he identified the opportunity to potentially acquire Alliance Boots, a deal that should close before the end of the first quarter.
As far as who will succeed him — that's harder to say, but the company could be looking to Europe.
"That's up for debate, it's still uncertain right now" Lekraj said.
Lekraj said the Alliance Boots operational team is viewed as being "very competent" within the investment community and noted that Walgreen is trying to increase its profitability on the front end of the store, where it sells grocery goods and other items.
"You may see someone with that type of background," he said.

Source: LendingClub prospectus
LendingClub, somewhat of a eBay of loans to connect borrowers and lenders, braved the choppy market Wednesday to sell shares of the first time.
The company raised $866 million by selling 57.7 million shares at $15 a share. That was a successful reception since it had planned to raise upwards of $750 million by selling 57.7 million shares for between $12 and $14 a share.
By raising $866 million, the company is fourth largest technology deal of the year, says John Fitzgibbon of IPOScoop.com. LendingClub’s proceeds area fraction of the $21.8 billion raised by Chinese Internet company Alibaba (BABA) . LendingClub also trails medical tech company IMS Health (IMS) at $1.3 billion and mobile tech firm Mobileye (MBLY) at $889 million, Fitzgibbon says.
“It’s one of the larger ones (tech IPOs of the year), but not all that noteworthy,” Fitzgibbon says.
Demand for the shares, expected to trade Thursday, appears strong.
Technology companies have been an important part of the initial public offering market’s rebound. The industry has raised $30.8 billion from offerings over the past 12 months, the largest of any industry, says Renaissance Capital. In terms of number of deals, 49 tech companies have launched IPOs the past 12 months, just behind the No. 1 source of offerings, health care, with 100.
There’s strong demand for LendingClub stock, says Linda Killian of Renaissance Capital, which manages the IPO exchange traded fund that trades by the symbol IPO. The company has emerged with a strong brand name in what could be a growing area of microlending, she says. The key will be if the company can go beyond being just a source of loans for consumers to consolidate credit card debt. LendingClub is making a push to be a source of loans for small business, she says.
“The big issue is how successful entering in the small business loan business,” she says.

Google is shutting down its Google NewsPrint
Google to shut Spanish news service
Google News exits Spain after a new law would have forced to it to pay publishers for their content
Google changes 'to fight piracy'
Online search giant Google is shutting down its Google News service in Spain before a new intellectual property law is introduced.
Google will shut the service on 16 December before the law comes into effect in January, the firm said.
The law allows Spanish publications to charge services like Google News if their content is shown on the site.
But Google has argued against the ruling, saying that it makes no money from its search-based service.
"It's with real sadness that on 16 December we'll remove Spanish publishers from Google News, and close Google News in Spain," said Richard Gingras, head of Google News in a blog post on Wednesday.
He went on to add that the law which would allow Spanish publishers to charge Google "for showing even the smallest snippet from their publications" was not sustainable.
"Google News itself makes no money (we do not show any advertising on the site)," he said.
Google versus newspapers
Mr Gingras also pointed out that publishers can choose whether or not they want their articles to appear in Google News.
"The vast majority choose to be included for very good reason. Google News creates real value for these publications by driving people to their websites, which in turn helps generate advertising revenues," he said.
The Spanish legislation, nicknamed the "Google Tax", did not specify how much the tech giant would have to pay publishers.
Global newspaper publishers have long argued that services such as Google News infringe on their copyright by creating an online selection of headlines.
Spanish journalist Miguel Anxo Murado argued that being able to access the news for free undermined the value of the information.
"It is not just because of the newspapers closing... it's also a matter of principle," he told BBC World Service radio.
"The idea that news comes for free sends the wrong message... news is very valuable and costly. Good information comes at a price."
German experience
Google started asking publishers for their consent to summarise their content after Germany revised its copyright laws in 2013, which would have required Google to make payments.
Nevertheless, some large German publishers have found Google's ability to push traffic to websites difficult to do without.
In November, Germany's biggest news publisher, Axel Springer, scrapped a move to block Google from running snippets of articles from its newspapers, saying that the experiment had caused traffic to its sites to plunge.
The firm had sought to restrict Google's use of news from four of its top-selling brands: welt.de, computerbild.de, sportbild.de and autobild.de.
Axel Springer's chief executive Mathias Doepfner said his company would have "shot ourselves out of the market" if it had continued with its demands for the US firm to pay licensing fees.
Analysis: Jane Wakefield, BBC Technology Reporter
Google News shutting in Spain raises a host of questions about the future of the search giant in Europe.
After Germany's experience, some now wonder if Spain may also come to regret its Google Tax, which requires news aggregators such as Google News to pay a fee to Spanish publications.
More widely the tense relationship that Google has with the European Union is starting to raise eyebrows.
Google is really under the microscope at the EU. A long-running investigation into whether its search business was anti-competitive has failed to reach agreement despite Google offering several amendments to how search results appear.
Its privacy policy is also under investigation and last year the 'right to be forgotten' law saw it and other search engines forced to remove links that individuals felt were inaccurate or irrelevant.
Some experts are starting to ask whether the search giant's patience with the European Union is beginning to run out.
That raises the question about whether we will increasingly see a two-tier system with the Google that Europeans can access becoming increasingly different to Google in the US.

Ed Miliband is to set out the principlesEd Miliband has ruled out any uncosted spending commitments in Labour's election manifesto, as he set out his party's plans to reduce the deficit.
Dealing with the public finances will be an "essential test" of Labour's credibility, the party leader said.
He argued boosting wages and taxing the better off, in addition to budget cuts in most areas, could contribute to eliminating the deficit by 2020.
Chancellor George Osborne said Labour only offered "economic chaos".
During a visit to Newcastle University he said Mr Miliband and his party "created the deficit and by delaying paying off the deficit what he's really telling the British people is that he would borrow more money and put up taxes".
Conservative Party chairman, Grant Shapps: "We haven't eliminated the deficit but we have cut it in half"
In his speech in central London, Mr Miliband said Labour would cut the deficit every year of the next parliament.
He promised "sensible reductions in public spending" and outlined pledges Labour has made so far:
Stopping the winter fuel allowance for "the wealthiest pensioners"
Capping child benefit rises at 1%
Scrapping police commissioners
Selling off "unwanted government assets".
He also said Labour would make savings of £500m in local government.
This includes merging some of England's 46 fire authorities and scrapping the New Homes Bonus, which rewards councils for the amount of homes built in their area.
Asked afterwards what more Labour would do to cut spending, he said that beyond the measures announced: "The right way to make these decisions is frankly in government".
He added: "If you start picking things out of the air, they won't be the most sensible changes for the country."
Mr Miliband came under fire from his political opponents and from some within his own party for omitting any mention of the deficit from his keynote conference speech in September - which he delivered by memory without autocue or notes.
In his speech on Thursday, he said: "There is not a path to growth and prosperity for working people which does not tackle the deficit."
Promising a "balanced approach which deals with our debts, but does so sensibly", he called for a "higher wage, higher skill economy".
Labour would also devolve "unprecedented levels" of spending to local government, he added.
Analysis
Robert Peston, BBC economics editor
Labour, as confirmed by Ed Miliband today, is promising that public sector debt as a share of national income will be falling by 2020 and that it will no longer be borrowing to finance "current" spending - that's day-to-day expenses such as civil service salaries and welfare payments, but not investment - also by 2020.
By contrast, the Lib Dems are wedded to the first portion of the path of deficit reduction outlined in last week's Autumn Statement, which would see the deficit on current spending, adjusting for the economic cycle, eliminated by 2017-18. But they are not signed up to as deep spending cuts as those planned by their Conservative partners in government.
As for the Tories, they want to see a surplus on the overall budget, that's including current and investment spending, by 2018-19.
Read more from Robert
Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has written to colleagues warning them they face cuts in their departmental budgets year after year until the deficit on day-to-day spending has gone.
The health and overseas aid budgets will be the only areas to be immune from the squeeze on spending, Mr Miliband said, although the schools budget in England could also be ringfenced too.
Tax receipts
Insisting that none of Labour's pre-election spending commitments will be funded by extra borrowing, Mr Miliband contrasted his approach with what he claimed were £7bn worth of unfunded tax cuts promised by the Conservatives.
With polls suggesting David Cameron's party is still more trusted on the economy, Mr Miliband also attempted to link his wider employment policies to deficit reduction.
He suggested tax receipts could be bolstered by getting people into more highly skilled, better-paid jobs and that Labour will prioritise "productive investment" in skills.
Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls: "What we need to do is be balanced, tough and sensible"
Asked about the party's record in government, Mr Balls told BBC News: "We didn't spend every pound well, of course we didn't. No government ever does."
But he said he was "proud" of his party's record and added: "I don't think there is any foundation at all to the idea that Labour's spending caused a global financial crisis."
'Economic risk'
Mr Osborne's plans are predicated on achieving a surplus in the public finances by 2018-9. He has said he believes this can be done without any tax rises and has rejected suggestions it will entail "colossal" cuts to public expenditure.
The government is expected to borrow more money this year than had previously been predicted.
In last week's Autumn Statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility raised its borrowing forecast for the current financial year from £86.6bn to £91.3bn but said this would still be below last year's total of £97.5bn.
Borrowing levels are forecast to fall every year until 2018-9, although Labour say the government has long abandoned its original 2010 target of eliminating the deficit by the time of next year's election.
Nick Robinson, BBC political editor
Just weeks after the speech which forgot the deficit comes the speech that remembers it - big time.
Ed Miliband knows he has a problem and can sense an opportunity.
The problem is Labour's lack of economic credibility - something every opinion poll confirms.
The opportunity is the chance to paint the Tories as not merely serious about cutting borrowing but ideologically obsessed with it.
Read more from Nick
Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that by not signing up to Mr Osborne's plans for a £23bn surplus in 2020, Labour had £50bn "wriggle room" compared to the Conservatives' plans.
Responding to Mr Miliband's speech for the Conservatives, Business minister Matthew Hancock said the plans were a "risk to the economic recovery".
He said: "Labour's policy is to run deficits forever - more borrowing that would add to the national debt every single year.
"That would mean more debt than hardworking taxpayers or our children could ever hope to repay."
'Relentless grind'
The Lib Dems have said they would borrow less than Labour and cut less than the Conservatives.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said Mr Miliband's speech contained "nothing new at all".
He told BBC News Labour's approach to deficit reduction was a "slow and relentless grind" while the Conservatives would go "even faster than is necessary".
The Institute of Directors welcomed what it said was "one of the clearest signs yet that Labour acknowledge there is still a long way to go" in cutting spending, while John Cridland, of the CBI, said all parties needed to recognise "serious structural changes" were needed to public services.
Labour backbench MP Diane Abbott said Mr Miliband's speech had been "fine" but added that the party should make "socialist choices" to reduce spending, like cutting the Trident nuclear missile system.
She told the London Live TV channel: "People are not going to vote Labour in order that we can cut just a little bit more kindly than the Tories."
 

Planning an M&A Beware  Fin4 might be reading your mailPlanning an M&A? Beware, Fin4 might be reading your mail
KV Kurmanath
REUTERS The relative simplicity of FIN4’s tactics makes the group’s intrusion attempts very difficult to detect.
Hacking group using language of markets to sniff out information
Hyderabad, December 10:  
US-based cyber security solutions firm FireEye has just uncovered a business espionage racket targeting over 100 corporates, to steal information.
The FIN4 group, as FireEye calls the hacking outfit, has a deep knowledge of how business deals are reached and how corporate entities communicate within and outside the organisation.
Unlike in other attacks, the hacker group is said to be very focussed. It targets people who might have access to confidential information.
“Operating since at least mid-2013, FIN4 distinctly focuses on compromising the accounts of individuals who possess non-public information about merger and acquisition (M&A) deals and major market-moving announcements, particularly in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries,” the special report prepared on the espionage said.
FIN4 has targeted individuals such as top executives, legal counsel, outside consultants and researchers. Ramsunder Papineni, Regional Director (India and SAARC) of FireEye, however, said that Indian firms have not been targeted by the group yet.
“We see this type of financially motivated hacking as a global threat. It’s impossible to quantify the financial impact of this type of hacking because there are too many unknown variables about how the information was distributed and employed by the threat group,” he said in an email response.
“Just like with the theft of intellectual property, a company may not realise the full impact of an attack for months or years, but the results can be devastating for the business,” he said.
Modus operandi
FIN4 follows a simple method to sniff out the credentials of targeted users, by sending them spear-phishing emails. They use language that is familiar in the financial world to fool their targets.
“The themes appear to be written by native English speakers familiar with both investment terminology and the inner workings of public companies, reflecting a deep knowledge of the target,” the report said.
Enticed, the receivers open the mail, exposing their credentials. There’s no malware infection involved.
The relative simplicity of FIN4’s tactics makes the group’s intrusion attempts very difficult to detect.
At a minimum, companies should enable two-factor authentication for email and systems’ logins and regularly train employees to watch for malicious activity.

The Guardian is keeping up the pressureJump to comments (…)
There is mounting controversy around Luxembourg’s accommodating approach to multinationals’ tax planning.  Photograph: Frederick Florin/AFP/Getty Images
Pressure is mounting on Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, after fresh allegations emerged outlining the tactics he used when he was prime minister of Luxembourg to promote the country as the destination for multinational corporations.
Bob Comfort, the former head of tax for Amazon, claimed Juncker had fiercely courted the online giant, behaving as a “business partner” and “helping solve problems”. Months after arriving in Luxembourg in 2003, Amazon secured a confidential deal from the local tax office. Two months ago that deal became the subject of a formal investigation by the European commission.
In an interview with the Luxembourg newspaper d’Lëtzebuerger Land , Comfort said: “The Luxembourg government presents itself as business partner, and I think it’s an accurate description: it helps to solve problems.”
He recalled meetings with top civil servants from the finance ministry and Juncker, who was then serving as both prime minister and finance minister. “His message was simply: ‘If you encounter problems which you don’t seem to be able to resolve, please come back and tell me. I’ll try to help.’”
Shortly before he retired from Amazon this summer, Comfort took on the additional role of Luxembourg’s “honorary consul for the Seattle region” . An official announcement noted he had “a long-standing relationship with Luxembourg”.
The mounting controversy around Luxembourg’s accommodating approach to multinationals’ tax planning came as George Osborne revealed details of a new “diverted profits tax”. The new tax, also called the Google tax, was announced in the autumn statement last week and the chancellor has claimed it will raise £1bn in the next five years. The new measures will target companies shifting profits out of the UK in artificial ways, with a punitive 25% tax rate from April next year.
A Treasury source said: “HMRC already has a pretty good idea of the companies that use these kind of structures and will be issuing notices to those companies. Companies then have 30 days to dispute the payment but if HMRC believes they are using the structure they would have to pay immediately. Obviously there may be companies that may not be on HMRC’s radar. We would expect them to report to HMRC that they are using these structures. If they don’t, that would be illegal.”
The Treasury expects the tax to hit companies such as Amazon and Google that make billions of pounds from sales to UK customers but book the revenues in companies overseas.
Margaret Hodge, chair of parliament’s public accounts committee, said: “This is an important symbolic statement but it is really on the margins … what you really need is international agreement and a really, really tough, determined HMRC.”
Pressure is building across Europe for tougher, quicker action. European commission investigators have said they believe the 2003 deal with Luxembourg, which is still in use by Amazon – appears to be so generous as to amount to illegal state aid, though inquiries are ongoing.
Amazon EU Sarl, the company with which customers across much of Europe do business when they buy online from the retailer, took €13.6bn (£10.7bn) in sales last year, up from €11.9bn in 2012. The company’s taxable profits were reduced, however, after deductions for royalty payments to another Luxembourg unit, an Amazon-controlled limited partnership, which is not subject to tax in the Grand Duchy.
In a statement to the Guardian, the retailer said: “Amazon has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg – we are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here.”
Last month, just after the commission’s state aid inquiry was revealed, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists , together with the Guardian and a team of international journalists in more than 20 countries, published investigations into a cache of hundreds of leaked tax deals secured by multinationals with Luxembourg authorities. Many of the deals rubber-stamped complex and aggressive tax avoidance structures that drained the tax coffers of other countries.
This week, a second batch of leaked documents has shed light on tax deals secured for Skype, Koch Industries and others . The widening scandal has led to suggestions that Luxembourg, rather than offering selected multinationals sweetheart deals in contravention of state aid rules, had been engaged in facilitating tax avoidance on an industrial scale.
Juncker has denied the charge. “I am not the architect of the Luxembourg model because this model doesn’t exist,” he said last month, insisting that his government did no more than compete hard for inward investment as others did.
Comfort, who retired from Amazon this year, recalls touring almost every country in western Europe with a small team looking for a regional base in 2003. “The final decision was made at the highest level of the company,” he said. “[Tax] did play a significant role, but it wasn’t the overriding factor.”
Journalist Brad Stone, in his book The Everything Store, described Comfort as the “true architect” of Amazon’s “arcane tax structure … deploying every trick in the book and inventing many new ones”.
Comfort says Amazon did nothing out of the ordinary by locating its European operation in Luxembourg, and has played down the significance of allegations it is not paying sufficient tax. “Governments think they aren’t getting their fair share, but multinationals follow the existing rules of the bilateral treaty system. The government’s unhappiness relates to an arguably outdated legal framework that has been designed for the 20th century.”
Asked what his role as honorary consul for the Seattle region entailed, Comfort said: “I think there are only four Luxembourgers in all of Washington State. So I am rarely called upon to perform consular functions such as helping with visas or bailing people out of jail. My work here is to help attract business to Luxembourg.”
Comfort could not be reached for further comment.

badly weakened Russian roubleRussia admits action to buoy rouble
Russia's central bank could hike interest rates to support the rouble on Thursday, analysts said
Russia's central bank has admitted it intervened to support the rouble in foreign currency markets last week spending a total of $4.53bn (£2.9bn).
It has spent more than $70bn supporting the rouble since the start of the year.
Its admission came as the World Bank warned the Russian economy would shrink by at least 0.7% in 2015 if oil prices do not recover.
Both the currency and Russian share indexes fell on Tuesday as global oil prices fell to a new five year low.
Rate rise?
Russia has been forced to defend its currency as Western sanctions, in response to its role in eastern Ukraine, and falling oil prices begin to bite.
But analysts suggested it may take a significant hike in interest rates to stop the currency from further falls as well as surging inflation, which stood at 9.1% in November.
"The CBR [Central Bank of Russia] simply is not doing enough to convince the market that it is serious, using a pea-shooter in terms of current piecemeal intervention," said Standard Bank analyst Tim Ash in a note. "It will need to hike rates significantly to defend the rouble, or let the rouble further weaken."
The bank has already raised interest rates by 1.5% in October to 9.5%. It is expected to raise interest rates further later this week.
On Tuesday the rouble fell by 0.9% against the US dollar to 54.25 roubles and lost 1.1% to 67.00 against the euro.
'Speculative demand'
Sberbank foreign exchange and rates chief strategist, Tom Levinson estimated the Russian central bank spent a further $300m to support the rouble in the currency markets again on Monday.
He added that the interventions had prevented the currency from trading much nearer to 60 roubles against the US dollar. But he said the rouble would be "unable to sustain lasting appreciation".
In November the central bank announced it was going ahead with a free float of the rouble by abolishing its unofficial link to the euro and the US dollar. It also announced it was ending automatic interventions to support the currency, instead propping it up only when it was deemed necessary.
The bank had previously supported the rouble when the exchange rate against the euro and dollar exceeded certain limits.
At the time the CBR's chairwoman, Elvira Nabiullina. said the bank would instead intervene in the currency market "at whichever moment and amount needed to decrease the speculative demand."
The bank has said it hopes to achieve a full floating exchange rate in 2015.
Economic woes
Meanwhile, the World Bank forecast Russia's economy would shrink by 0.7% in 2015, but warned that the contraction would be worse if oil prices were to keep sliding.
The World Bank said its forecast is based on a scenario of crude prices averaging at $78 in 2015.
But if oil prices fell to $70 on average, Russia's output would shrink by 1.5%, it said.
Russia's reliance on tax revenues from the oil industry makes it particularly sensitive to price movements.
Last week, the Russian government warned the economy would fall into recession next year.
Russia's economic development ministry estimates the economy will contract by 0.8% next year.
It had previously estimated the  economy would grow by 1.2% in 2015.
Stock price fall
Both Russian stock indexes also fell heavily in response to the plunging oil price.
The dollar-based RTS fell 1.9% to 854 points, having earlier set a new five-year low of 847 points. The rouble-based MICEX index was down 0.7% at 1,471 points.
Brent crude fell 0.7% on Tuesday to $65.75, extending Monday's steep decline.
Oil has fallen around 40% since the summer as a result of over supply and weaker global demand, particularly from China, the world's second largest consumer of oil, where industrial production has slowed in recent months.
An OPEC meeting at the end of November, which discussed cutting oil production to halt the slide in oil prices, broke up without agreement.

The FCA report into annuity sales practices is outFCA publishes the findings of its work into annuities sales practices and retirement income market
Published: 11/12/2014   Last Modified : 11/12/2014
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has today published the findings of its thematic review into annuity sales practices and the interim findings of a market study into retirement income.
In February 2014 the FCA found that the annuities market was not working well for most consumers and launched a market study to look at the entire retirement income market. As a result of the new pension freedoms announced in the 2014 budget, the scope of the market study was changed to look at how the market might develop, as well as gathering evidence on how it works today.  A separate piece of work was undertaken to look at annuity sales practices.
The market study confirms that competition is not working as well as it could for consumers, with many continuing to miss out on a higher income by not shopping around.  However, FCA analysis suggests that for people with average-sized pension pots and low risk appetite, the right annuity purchased on the open market offers good value for money relative to alternative drawdown strategies.
The Government’s reforms increase the at-retirement choices facing consumers, so it is vital that consumers are properly supported in making their decisions.  The Guidance Guarantee will perform an important role, but firms’ own communications with their customers will remain of central importance, and the FCA has made a series of recommendations to improve the way firms communicate with customers about their options.
Christopher Woolard, director of policy, risk and research at the FCA said:
“The Budget reforms are a game changer for the retirement income market.  People will be given more choice and many will want some support to ensure they make the right decisions for them.
“The Government’s new Guidance Guarantee, with the standards we have already proposed is a vital part of this, now firms need to play their part.”
“We want to see firms improving the way they communicate with their customers.  In order for the pension reforms to work and for people to have trust and confidence in the products they are buying firms need to act now.”
The FCA has identified future risks and has set out what they will be looking for as the market develops.  The FCA’s principal recommendations are:
Requiring firms to make it clear to consumers how their quote compares relative to other providers on the open market.
The introduction of a behaviourally trialled alternative to the current system of wake-up packs. This would build on work already underway and feed into our work considering how we will replace the ABI Code with FCA regulation.
Recommending that the pension guidance service and firms take account of the findings of the market study on consumer behaviour when designing tools to support decision-making.
In the longer term, recommending the development of a ‘Pensions Dashboard’ which would allow consumers to view all their lifetime pension savings in one place.
The FCA is seeking views on its initial findings and will consult at a later date if any potential rule changes are needed.
At the same times as carrying out the market study the FCA also conducted a review of annuity sales practices.  The review  found evidence indicating that firms‘ sales practices are contributing to consumers not shopping around and switching, and significant improvements are required now.
The FCA identified particular areas of concern in relation to enhanced annuities, where customers are often not informed of shopping around or encouraged to do so to get a higher income and where some firms are failing to tell customers other providers may offer enhanced annuities for medical conditions that they do not underwrite.  
The FCA is asking the majority of firms involved in the review to do further work under FCA supervision.  This work is to determine if the findings in relation to enhanced annuities are indicative of a more widespread problem.  This will cover the period since the Financial Services Authority’s previous thematic work on Open Market Options in 2008. At this stage, this will be a sample of relevant sales since May 2008 rather than a full review and will involve individual firms gathering more evidence to determine whether customers with certain medical conditions or lifestyle factors missed out on a higher retirement income. Following this work the FCA will take a decision on whether further action is needed.
The FCA also found examples where the ABI Code is not being applied in practice.   The ABI Code is compulsory for ABI members, and sets the industry’s own benchmark for members about communicating key information to consumers clearly and consistently.
Following discussions with the ABI, the FCA has decided to consult on its rules to replace the ABI code, which would cover all firms, not just ABI members.  During any transitional period, the ABI code will remain in force for its members.
Notes to editors
Thematic review: TR14/20: Annuities sales practice
On the 1 April 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Sugar Stocks Surge on Higher Prices for Ethanol Procurement
NDTV | Updated On: December 11, 2014 12:41 (IST)
L&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
Shares in sugar companies surged on Thursday after the government approved a mechanism for procurement of ethanol by state-run oil marketing companies.
The government has fixed a price between Rs 48.5-Rs 49.50 per litre, depending upon the distance of sugar mill from the depot of the state-run oil marketing companies for procurement of ethanol for blending with petrol.
The price fixed by the government is much higher than the price of Rs 29 per litre, which oil companies presently pay to buy sugarcane extracts.
Balrampur Chini Mills jumped 9 per cent to Rs 63.7, Bajaj Hindustan was up over 6 per cent at Rs 22.25, while Shree Renuka Sugars surged 6 per cent to Rs 17.80.
Sugar stocks outperformed the benchmark Nifty, which was down 0.8 per cent as of 12.14 p.m.

The first contains provisional findingsRetirement income market study
Published: 11/12/2014   Last Modified : 11/12/2014
This interim report presents our provisional findings on how the current market is operating and a series of recommendations to improve the way firms communicate with customers about their options. In addition, we have also identified some future risks and set out what we will be looking for as the market develops.
In February 2014 we found that the annuities market was not working well for most consumers. Based on these findings we launched a market study of the entire retirement income market to assess whether competition in this market was working – and if not, to understand why, and what changes could be made to drive better consumer outcomes.
Since the launch of this market study, the landscape has changed. In March this year the Government announced the biggest reform of the retirement system for a generation, giving consumers much greater freedom over how to use their pension savings.
Following this announcement, the scope of the market study was changed to look at how the market might develop, as well as gathering evidence on how it works today. A separate piece of work was also undertaken to look specifically at non-advised annuity sales practices.
The Government’s reforms have increased the at-retirement choices facing consumers, so it is vital that consumers are properly supported in making their decisions. In November we published the standards for the bodies responsible for delivering the Government’s new guidance guarantee aimed at those with defined contribution pensions. We have also published rules requiring pension providers to direct their customers to the guidance service at retirement.
The pensions guidance service will perform an important role, but firms’ own communications with their customers will remain of central importance. This interim report presents our provisional findings on how the current market is operating and a series of recommendations to improve the way firms communicate with customers about their options. In addition, we have also identified some future risks and set out what we will be looking for as the market develops.
MS14/3.2 Interim report
The market study has been published at the same time as our thematic review into annuities sales practices. We will be asking some firms to do further work to determine if the findings of this thematic review in relation to the sale of enhanced annuities are indicative of a more widespread problem.
The scope of our study and our approach
We examined products purchased by UK consumers with their defined contribution pension pots that provide an income in retirement – specifically, annuities and income drawdown.
We undertook two public calls for evidence, engaging with a wide range of industry stakeholders, consumer organisations and other Government departments. We analysed a range of information from firms gathered both prior and subsequent to the March 2014 Budget. This has helped inform our provisional findings and our early views on how the market might evolve.
We commissioned both qualitative and quantitative consumer research, conducted a behavioural experiment of consumer decision-making, and international comparative analysis of ten other countries. We undertook economic analysis of the value for money of annuities and other retirement income strategies.
Our provisional findings
Competition in this market is not working well for consumers. Many consumers are missing out by not shopping around for an annuity and switching providers, and some do not purchase the best annuity for their circumstances. Consumers’ tendency to buy products from their existing provider weakens competitive pressure on incumbent firms and makes it harder for challenger firms to attract a critical mass of customers.
Looking forward, we have identified developments we very much want to see in the market, but we have also identified future risks.
Proposed remedies
This report sets out a number of proposed remedies that we believe will go some way to address the concerns identified in our provisional findings, with a particular focus on stopping things getting in the way of consumer choice, and improving the clarity and simplicity of communication between firms and their consumers. We want firms to design and sell retirement income products that meet genuine consumer needs and provide good value. People should get the income in retirement that they have saved for.
Next steps
We invite comments on our provisional findings and proposed remedies by 30 January 2015. Please complete our online response form .
Once we have considered consultation responses, we will produce our final report in 2015.

The second report looks at how annuitiesTR14/20: Annuities sales practice
Published: 11/12/2014   Last Modified : 11/12/2014
This paper presents the findings of our thematic review of the non-advised  sales practices of pension providers offering annuities to their existing customers
Why did we carry out this thematic review?
Our first thematic review into annuities (TR14/2) reported that many consumers were buying an annuity from their current pension provider, and that they may be missing out on a higher income in retirement as a result. We found that some parts of the market were not working well for some consumers and specifically that many consumers do not shop around and switch provider, even when a high proportion of these would be better off doing so.
As a result, we announced a review that aimed to understand whether firms’ sales and customer retention practices contributed to customers not shopping around and switching. It seeks to mitigate the risk that consumers have a reduced income in retirement as a result of buying the wrong type of annuity or not shopping around on the open market.
Who should read this paper?
firms selling annuities
firms which have existing personal or stakeholder pension customers and their representatives
consumer representative groups
individual consumers
What did we review?
we looked at the non-advised sales practices of pension providers offering annuities to their existing customers
our sample of firms covered 70% of this market, looking at material relating to the period September 2013 to November 2013
we reviewed customer literature provided by firms leading up to retirement
we listened to telephone calls discussing retirement income options
we reviewed potential drivers of risk in the firms’ businesses  
What were our findings?
We found evidence indicating that firms’ sales practices are contributing to consumers not shopping around and switching.  At times, consumers are potentially buying the wrong type of annuity, in particular not purchasing an enhanced annuity when they may be eligible for one.  As a result, consumers may be missing out on a potentially higher income in retirement.
What are the next steps?
We are asking some firms to do further work to determine if our findings in relation to enhanced annuities are indicative of a more widespread problem and/or have led to poor consumer outcomes when buying annuities.
The Financial Services Authority’s (FSA) previous thematic work on Open Market Options in 2008 clearly highlighted that firms needed to make improvements in relation to the way consumers were informed about shopping around for enhanced annuities.
We believe that from that time firms should have been in no doubt about their responsibilities to their customers in relation to enhanced annuities.

Norway s central bank has cut interest ratesPress release
Key policy rate lowered by 0.25 percentage point to 1.25 percent
Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to lower the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.25 percent.
The upturn in the world economy remains moderate and there is considerable uncertainty surrounding developments ahead. Growth prospects for the Norwegian economy have weakened. Activity in the petroleum industry is softening and the sharp fall in oil prices is likely to amplify this tendency. This will have spillover effects on the wider economy and unemployment may edge up ahead. At the same time, the krone has depreciated markedly, which is helping to dampen the effects on the Norwegian economy and underpin inflation.
"The analysis in the Monetary Policy Report presented today implies a key policy rate of 1¼ percent, or somewhat lower, in the period towards the end of 2016", says Governor Øystein Olsen.
Capacity utilisation in the mainland economy will probably decline to a further extent than projected earlier, but is expected to increase again towards the end of the projection period. Inflation is projected to lie close to 2.5 percent in the coming years.
The Executive Board decided at its meeting that the key policy rate should lie in the interval ¾–1¾ percent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 19 March 2015, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.

Christies in New York is putting up for auctionRELEASE: CHRISTIE’S TO OFFER THE ‘RICKETTS’ APPLE-1 PERSONAL COMPUTER ON DECEMBER 11 IN NEW YORK
 DISCOVERED AT A STORAGE LOCKER AUCTION IN VIRGINIA, THE ONLY KNOWN
SURVIVING APPLE-1 DOCUMENTED AS SOLD BY
STEVE JOBS TO AN INDIVIDUAL OUT OF HIS PARENTS’ GARAGE
 New York – On December 11, Christie’s is honored to offer an American cultural icon,  ‘The Ricketts’ Apple-1 Personal Computer, as part of the auction house’s inaugural Exceptional Sale in New York, taking place December 11 at Rockefeller Center. Named after its first owner Charles Ricketts, this example is the only known surviving Apple-1 documented to have been sold directly by Steve Jobs to an individual from his parents’ garage. It is estimated at $400,000 – 600,000, the highest estimate yet for an original Apple-1 offered at auction.
23 years after Ricketts bought the Apple-1 from Jobs in Los Altos, it was acquired by Bruce Waldack, a freshly minted entrepreneur who’d just sold his company DigitalNation.  The Ricketts Apple-1 was auctioned at a sheriff’s sale of Waldack’s property at a self-storage facility in Virginia in 2004, and won by the present consigner, the American collector, Bob Luther.
The Ricketts Apple-1 is fully operational, having been serviced and started by Apple-1 expert Corey Cohen in October 2014. Mr. Cohen ran the standard original software program, Microsoft BASIC, and also an original Apple-1 Star Trek game in order to test the machine.
The computer will be sold with the cancelled check from the original garage purchase on July 27, 1976 made out to Apple Computer by Charles Ricketts for $600, which Ricketts later labeled as “Purchased July 1976 from Steve Jobs in his parents’ garage in Los Altos”. 
A second cancelled check for $193 from August 5, 1976 is labeled “Software NA Programmed by Steve Jobs August 1976”. Although Jobs is not usually thought of as undertaking much of the programming himself, many accounts of the period place him in the middle of the action, soldering circuits and clearly making crucial adjustments for close customers, as in this case.
These checks were later used as part of the evidence for the City of Los Altos to designate the Jobs family home at 2066 Crist Drive as a Historic Resource, eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and copies can be found in the Apple Computer archives at Stanford University Libraries.
In addition to the Ricketts Apple-1, the sale will include The Ron Wayne Apple Archive ($30,000-50,000). Ron Wayne co-founded Apple Computer, together with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976. Wayne left the partnership 11 days after the company was formed, but remained a consultant to the enterprise and left a significant mark on the company having drafted fundamental documents and Apple’s first logo.  Coming directly from Ron Wayne, the archive comprises the original working proofs of the Apple-1 Operation Manual, with his original company logo. This proof page of the logo may be the oldest copy of an Apple logo in existence. Wayne possessed and retained these proof copies because he laid out the entire design and contents of the Manual, in partnership with Steve Jobs. The lot will also include design renderings, bluelines, sketches and diagrams for a proposed Apple II personal computer cabinet.

the closure of its Google news servicePrint
Google to shut Spanish news service
Google News exits Spain after a new law would have forced to it to pay publishers for their content
Google changes 'to fight piracy'
Online search giant Google is shutting down its Google News service in Spain before a new intellectual property law is introduced.
Google will shut the service on 16 December before the law comes into effect in January, the firm said.
The law allows Spanish publications to charge services like Google News if their content is shown on the site.
But Google has argued against the ruling, saying that it makes no money from its search-based service.
"It's with real sadness that on 16 December we'll remove Spanish publishers from Google News, and close Google News in Spain," said Richard Gingras, head of Google News in a blog post on Wednesday.
He went on to add that the law which would allow Spanish publishers to charge Google "for showing even the smallest snippet from their publications" was not sustainable.
"Google News itself makes no money (we do not show any advertising on the site)," he said.
Google versus newspapers
Mr Gingras also pointed out that publishers can choose whether or not they want their articles to appear in Google News.
"The vast majority choose to be included for very good reason. Google News creates real value for these publications by driving people to their websites, which in turn helps generate advertising revenues," he said.
The Spanish legislation, nicknamed the "Google Tax", did not specify how much the tech giant would have to pay publishers.
Global newspaper publishers have long argued that services such as Google News infringe on their copyright by creating an online selection of headlines.
Spanish journalist Miguel Anxo Murado argued that being able to access the news for free undermined the value of the information.
"It is not just because of the newspapers closing... it's also a matter of principle," he told BBC World Service radio.
"The idea that news comes for free sends the wrong message... news is very valuable and costly. Good information comes at a price."
German experience
Google started asking publishers for their consent to summarise their content after Germany revised its copyright laws in 2013, which would have required Google to make payments.
Nevertheless, some large German publishers have found Google's ability to push traffic to websites difficult to do without.
In November, Germany's biggest news publisher, Axel Springer, scrapped a move to block Google from running snippets of articles from its newspapers, saying that the experiment had caused traffic to its sites to plunge.
The firm had sought to restrict Google's use of news from four of its top-selling brands: welt.de, computerbild.de, sportbild.de and autobild.de.
Axel Springer's chief executive Mathias Doepfner said his company would have "shot ourselves out of the market" if it had continued with its demands for the US firm to pay licensing fees.
Analysis: Jane Wakefield, BBC Technology Reporter
Google News shutting in Spain raises a host of questions about the future of the search giant in Europe.
After Germany's experience, some now wonder if Spain may also come to regret its Google Tax, which requires news aggregators such as Google News to pay a fee to Spanish publications.
More widely the tense relationship that Google has with the European Union is starting to raise eyebrows.
Google is really under the microscope at the EU. A long-running investigation into whether its search business was anti-competitive has failed to reach agreement despite Google offering several amendments to how search results appear.
Its privacy policy is also under investigation and last year the 'right to be forgotten' law saw it and other search engines forced to remove links that individuals felt were inaccurate or irrelevant.
Some experts are starting to ask whether the search giant's patience with the European Union is beginning to run out.
That raises the question about whether we will increasingly see a two-tier system with the Google that Europeans can access becoming increasingly different to Google in the US.

Rupee at 9-month low  RBI intervention seenForex update: Rupee plunges 31 paise to 10-month low of 62.33 against dollar

The rupee on Thursday plunged 31 paise to a ten-month low of 62.33 versus the Greenback on strong demand for the US dollar due to oil firms stepping up purchases of crude oil trading near 5-year lows and a weak trend in shares.
Concerns related to capital outflows and a strong dollar in overseas markets against other currencies like the Japanese Yen too weighed on the rupee, a forex dealer said.
Logging its fourth consecutive session of decline, the domestic unit has now shed 56 paise against the US dollar.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the rupee resumed lower at 62.15 a dollar from its Wednesday's close of 62.02 and immediately the intra-day high of 62.12.
However, weakness in the domestic equity market throughout the day put pressure on the domestic currency.
The rupee gradually declined to a low of 62.3575 before ending at 62.33, logging a fall of 31 paise.
This is the currency's weakest close since February, 2014.
In terms of single-session fall, Thursday's 31-paise slide is its biggest drop against the US dollar since October 16, when it had slumped by 42 paise.
The American unit got a lift against the rupee as unwinding of the Yen and Euro carry trades triggered a sell-off in local equities.
"The sell-off global equity market has spilled over into Indian shores as well. As a result, we have seen buying of US Dollars... Over the past two sessions. There was demand noted from a few PSUs," said Anindya Banerjee, Currency Analyst, Kotak Securities.
Meanwhile, the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex on Thursday , after taking a respite for a day, tumbled by 229.09 points (or 0.82 per cent).
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out US $6.92 million on Wednesday, as per data released by market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
The dollar index was up by 0.06 per cent against its six major global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said, "Indian Rupee depreciated by half per cent, taking cues from dollar index which is trading multi-year highs. Also, the dollar demand from oil companies dented the rupee movement further. There is caution ahead of consumer price inflation data due tomorrow (Friday)."
The trading range for the spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 62.00 to 62.70, Brahmbhatt added.

Indias fastest train may derail existing onesWritten by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 1:54 am
The highly anticipated “semi-high speed” train will run at 160 km per hour, but in the process, it will significantly reduce the capacity of the entire line to accommodate other trains. This means that while the new train will zoom past, all other existing trains will have to virtually wait on the side keeping the line clear for it.
The Railway Board’s Traffic directorate made this assessment about erosion of “section capacity” in an internal consultation about operating the train while adhering to safety parameters, according to information accessed by The Indian Express. The pilot for the nine identified corridors for “semi-bullet” trains will be launched at the end of this month with the Gatimaan Express, which will run between Delhi and Agra.
From safety point of view, the Research Design and Standards Organisation, the Railways research arm, said that to make way for this one train, at least one block section around seven kilometers ahead will have to be kept free of trains. As a consequence, other trains be crippled, effectively reducing the line’s capacity.
During peak traffic hour, the Gatimaan will affect at least 10 super fast trains and an equal number of slower freight trains on its route.
The Taj Express, two Swarn Jayanthi Express trains, the Punjab Mail, the Chennai Gharib Rath and the Chennai Rajdhani are among the trains with thousands of passengers that will be affected. Internally, ministry officials are equating this with “running a bullock cart and a sports car on the same track at the same time”.
The Railways on Wednesday decided to make the Train Protection and Warning System mandatory for semi-high speed corridors. In the Delhi-Agra section, the system is already under trial but it does not address the issue of line capacity, senior traffic officials of the Railway Board said.
Sources said the Railways plans to launch the country’s first semi-bullet train on December 30. To run at 160 kmph, the Gatimaan Express will carry fewer passengers than a Shatabdi. Tickets will cost about 25 per cent more than a Shatabdi, and the train will reach Agra 15 minutes quicker.
The Gatimaan has taken an unusually long time to attain the mandatory Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) clearance. Chairman of the Railway Board Arunendra Kumar said, “The queries of the CRS have already been answered. We will get the clearance soon.”

(Uma Bharti said during Question…)
NEW DELHI: A consortium of seven IITs is preparing the Ganga Basin Management Plan and the first version of the project is scheduled to be submitted by it soon, Lok Sabha was informed today.
Union Minister for Water Resources and Ganga Rejuvenation Uma Bharti said an interim report along with 36 thematic reports have been submitted so far by the consortium of IITs.
Bharti said during Question Hour that a number of countries have shown interest in participating in Ganga rejuvenation.
Collaboration with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is under consideration in addition to the existing project with JICA assistance of Rs 496.9 crore, she said.
The Minister said the Union Budget 2014-15 has set up 'Namami Gange', an integrated Ganga conservation mission at an outlay of Rs 2,037 crore for rejuvenation of river Ganga and its tributaries.
"The mandate of Ministry of Water Resources has been enlarged to include river development and Ganga rejuvenation. The action plan for Ganga rejuvenation has been developed by convergence of different ministries through a group of secretaries and stake holders consultations through 'Ganga Manthan'," she said.
Bharti said government has also reconstituted the National Ganga River Basin Authority on September 29, 2014, incorporating the provision of a vice-chairperson with appropriate delegation and a meeting of the Authority was held on October 27.
She said specific action points have been identified for key thrust areas for rejuvenation of the river, including protection and beautification of river front, conservation of aquatic life and afforestation.

NEW DELHI: Shares of SpiceJet continued their downward trend, slipping over 7 per cent in intraday trade on Thursday.
The fall comes despite the low-cost carrier getting some relief on Wednesday with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) giving it another five days to pay dues amounting to about Rs 200 crore.
SpiceJet shares have fallen 24% since December 1 when the payment trouble at the company erupted.
Today, the airline is offering cut-price fares on some sectors; in some instances almost half of what is charged by rivals. This falied to revive sentiment on the Street.
Also, the company seems to have failed to benefit from falling crude prices that is a huge factor in improving profit margins.
Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala picked 75 lakh shares of SpiceJet for more than Rs 13 crore through open market route in November end; though he tacitly said that he was not bullish on the stock.

News Release - Bank of England announces measures to bolster transparency and accountability
11 December 2014
Page Content
The Bank of England today published an independent report by former Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh, following his review of the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) transparency practices and procedures.
The Bank also announced a series of significant transparency, accountability and governance enhancements designed to put the Bank at the forefront of international best practice and enhance its ability to fulfil its mission to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.
 
Governor Warsh recommended that the Bank adopt reforms in service to what he called the “Big 4” objectives: making sound policy decisions; communicating judgments effectively; ensuring accountability for its actions; and creating a fair and accurate historical record. 
 
The MPC welcomed Governor Warsh’s report, accepted his recommendations, and announced the following changes to its practices:
 
publication of both the minutes of its policy meetings and (in the relevant months) the Inflation Report at the same time as its policy decisions, starting in August 2015;
publication of written transcripts of the meetings at which monetary policy is decided, and related staff policy briefing material, with an 8-year lag, as of the March 2015 policy meeting;
alteration of its 2016 meeting schedule to provide scope to move to eight policy meetings a year;
plan to hold four joint meetings between the Monetary and Financial Policy Committees in 2016.
 
Alongside these measures, the Bank also proposed a simpler structure for its governing bodies and a clearer commitment to accountability. These proposals seek to reinforce the intent of existing legislation and make the Bank as effective as possible in delivering the responsibilities given to it by Parliament. They include:
 
aligning the status of the FPC and the PRA Board with the tried and tested model of the MPC;
establishing the Bank’s Court as unitary board, with executives and non-executives working together to govern the corporation;
publishing, during 2015, the minutes of the Court meetings held between 1914 and 1987, thereby aligning its release of archives with best practice in Whitehall; and
releasing, in January 2015, and in appropriately redacted form, the minutes of Court and related meetings during the crisis period of 2007-09, as requested by the Treasury Committee. In combination with the recent Plenderleith, Winters, and Stockton reviews, this provides a complete record of the Bank’s activities during the crisis.
 
In announcing today’s measures, the Governor said:
 
“The Bank now has immense responsibilities for monetary stability, financial stability and for microprudential regulation. And with these responsibilities comes the need for effective transparency, genuine accountability and robust governance. Today I am pleased to announce the most significant set of changes to how we present and explain our interest rate decisions since the Monetary Policy Committee was formed in 1997. Alongside those measures, we have also proposed a number of additional changes that will mark a step change in the governance of this institution. These changes will enhance our transparency and make us more accountable to the British people.”

See 30% headroom to boost supply: Praj IndustriesIn an interview to CNBC-TV18, Gajanan Nabar, CEO and MD at Praj Industries  spoke about the financial performance of the company in the quarter gone by and the road ahead.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: How does this development benefit Praj Industries? Is it possible to quantify it?
A: This is a step in right direction. It shows government resolve towards the blending program and towards ultimate ethanol sustainability program for the country. This would mean that the over all blending percentage which is hovering around two percent would go up as per the mandate closer to five percent. They have taken out some of the hurdles in the blending program; one is on the excise duty front so they have put a mechanism in place. Also they have given a price indicative which is attractive enough for all the ethanol producers so that they could supply to the oil companies. So, it is a very well taken step towards the right direction. The reason of that is a there would be demand on supply of ethanol for the capacity would be built in for both fuel as well as it would have some slow bowling effect on the beverage grade ethanol as well.
Q: Can you just tell us where does Praj Industries come into the entire value chain?
A: We have multi seed multi product plants so the industry which is making only beverage grade ethanol we could also provide technology to convert those plants into making multi products so including biofuels and also enhance their capacities in the bottleneck. So, overall we can work with the ethanol and sugar industry so that they can enhance their production, they can also optimise their supply and play between the two products. So, that is a very important position that we can play in this.
Reema: With a higher ethanol price it is quite likely that the demand for ethanol will go up. What were the capacities of Praj Industries currently stand at and would increase in demand necessitate in increase in capacity for your company?
A: We have already mentioned in our past few calls that we are about 30 percent headroom to increase our supply of plant and machinery and overall capability of supply in technology as well. So we are good for the time being we will take a call as we see this demand really unfolding in the market. 
Ekta: Can you tell us what your order books stands at this point in time and what has the change been possible on a sequential basis? How much of a change do you expect in your order book on account of this?
A: We need to wait for another one or two quarters before we see some momentum gaining on there. Last quarter we announced order book of Rs 730 crore and we are seeing some traction in order inflow but next one or two quarter would really be giving us further direction on that.
Ekta: So when you say some traction in your order inflow where is this traction coming from primarily? Who are you servicing, who are you clients at this point in time?
A: We are also into critical process equipments for oil and gas so we are getting some order from there. We are getting orders from our coal business which is ethanol and brewery and also from water and waste water. So, we are seeing all quarters we are getting some traction.

latest effort to get themECB cuts rates and launches stimulus programme
ECB President Mario Draghi explained that there are some differences amongst council members
Euro inflation nears five-year low
The European Central Bank has cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.05%, and introduced new stimulus measures.
The ECB had earlier cut its rate from 0.25% to 0.15% in June, and also became the first major central bank to introduce negative interest rates.
It will also launch an asset purchase programme, which will buy debt products from banks.
It is hoped this move will add liquidity to the financial system and revive lending.
'Mid-road'
The move falls short of a programme of buying government bonds - a process known as quantitative easing (QE), and one which the US Federal Reserve has undertaken.
ECB boss Mario Draghi said that QE had been discussed by the bank.
"Some of our governing council members were in favour of doing more than I've just presented, and some were in favour of doing less," he said.
"So our proposal strikes the mid-road.... a broad asset purchase programme was discussed, and some governors made clear that they would like to do more."
The ECB has been under pressure to kick-start the eurozone economy, as manufacturing output has slowed and inflation has fallen to just 0.3%.
In his latest blog BBC Business Editor Robert Peston described today's move as "a last roll of the dice".
"The European Central Bank has now almost exhausted its ammunition for preventing the Eurozone sliding into a devastating deflationary, contractionary spiral," he said.
The ECB hopes to increase lending in the eurozone economy
Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC Economics Correspondent
So the ECB is getting back into the business of buying financial assets. No government debt this time, though it's clear that could yet come.
Instead the focus is on assets that bundle up private sector loans.
Does that sound familiar? Yes, it was that kind of stuff that played a central role in the financial crisis, especially mortgage backed securities in the US.
But that market is much less developed in Europe and it could ultimately help the Eurozone deal with another problem: the continued weakness of the banks.
If the market for this type of asset were to expand it would make European business finance a bit more American, with a bigger share of commercial loans coming through the financial markets and less through struggling banks.
'New credit flows'
Referring to one element of the new stimulus programmes, the purchase of asset-backed securities (ABS), Mr Draghi said: "The Eurosystem will purchase a broad portfolio of simple and transparent asset-backed securities with underlying assets consisting of claims against the euro area non-financial private sector under an ABS purchase programme.
"This reflects the role of the ABS market in facilitating new credit flows to the economy and follows the intensification of preparatory work on this matter."
Mr Draghi also gave an update on the ECB's forecasts for the eurozone economy.
The new predictions warned of slower growth, of 0.9% in 2014, and of 1.6% in 2015.
Meanwhile the forecast for inflation was cut to 0.6% rising to 1.1% in 2015, and well short of the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2.0%.
After the latest news was announced the euro fell to $1.2996, the lowest since July 2013 and the first time it has fallen below $1.30 since then.
'Progress'
As was the case after the ECB's last rate cut in June, Mr Draghi again said that cuts had reached "the lower bound".
The main benchmark refinancing rate determines what banks pay the ECB for credit, and affects what banks charge companies to borrow.
The central bank also cut its deposit rate, what banks pay to keep their money at the central bank, to minus 0.2% from minus 0.1%.
It is hoped that this measure will encourage banks to lend to business, rather than sit on their cash.
"For years the ECB has been very slow to react and often frustrated markets," said Aberdeen Asset Management Investment Manager Luke Bartholomew.
"But in the face of dire and clearly worsening economic indicators Draghi has actually gone beyond markets' expectations today.  The frustration is that it has taken so long with inflation having already fallen so low, but it is certainly progress."

Sensex Falls 229 Points as Energy Stocks Slide; RIL Falls 2.8%L&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
The BSE Sensex fell 229 points or 0.82 per cent on Thursday, while the broader Nifty ended below the key 8,300 mark for the first time since October 30. The rupee also came under sharp selling pressure and closed near a 10-month low at 62.33 per dollar. (Read: Why rupee is down )
December has been a weak month for domestic equities so far. The Sensex is now down over 1,200 points in just nine sessions, while the Nifty has fallen around 300 points.
The latest bout of weakness in domestic equities and rupee has come on the back of a sharp slowdown in buying by foreign funds, which have been the major force behind the superlative returns this year. Profit booking by foreign investors is par for the course towards the end of a calendar year, analysts say.
Weak global cues have also dampened sentiments in domestic shares. Global markets have come under sharp selloff because of a slide in energy shares and on concerns about economic growth.
India is a big beneficiary of the slump in crude prices, which hit a new five-year low below $65 per barrel on Wednesday. However, the fall in oil prices is bad news for upstream oil companies such as state-run ONGC and Cairn India and for refiners such as Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries because lower oil prices translate into lower margins.
ONGC fell 3.2 per cent, while index heavyweight RIL declined 2.8 per cent. Gail India ended 2.4 per cent lower and Cairn India fell 2.33 per cent.
High beta realty stocks also came under selling pressure today. IT stocks also continued their slide, falling 1.2 per cent. Infosys closed down 2.2 per cent, its 10th straight session of fall.
Gainers included drugmakers such as Dr Reddy's and Lupin, which are seen as defensive bets. IDFC, Tech Mahindra and Coal India were the top three gainers today.
The Sensex ended at 27,602, while the Nifty declined 63 points to close at 8,292.90.

Mumbai: After a day's breather, Indian stocks continued their downslide on Thursday with benchmark Sensex tumbling 229.09 points to six-week low of 27,602.01 on sharp losses in RIL and ONGC after further drop in crude oil price.
Similarly, the 50-issue CNX Nifty of the NSE also plunged by 62.75 points, or 0.75 per cent, to end below 8,300-mark for the first time after one and half months at 8,292.90.
In line fall in local equities, the Indian rupee fell to nine-month low levels of 62.3 against the greenback. Weak Asian trends on the back of overnight steep fall on Wall Street amid slow down in capital inflows weighed on the stock market sentiment.
Besides RIL and ONGC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, TCS, Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Gail India suffered marked losses.
#sensex #nifty #bse #nse
Besides Oil&Gas, realty, IT, power and banking counters also suffered heavy losses while only some of the defensive pharma stocks attracted some buying interest.
Besides RIL and ONGC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, TCS, Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Gail India suffered marked losses.
Brent crude oil fell to five-year low below US dollar 65 a barrel, putting pressure on oil companies. The BSE 30-share barometer resumed lower on weak Asian cues and moved in negative terrain throughout the day before concluding at 27,602.01, a fall of 229.09 points or 0.82 per cent. This is its weakest close since 27,346.33 on October 30.
On Wednesday, Sensex had snapped a three-day falling trend as it recovered by about 34.09 points or 0.12 per cent.
"Weak Asian markets and fresh fears from Euro region kept Indian markets volatile. Mixed sentiments on the back of weak rupee and lower oil too added to the volatility. FII liquidity outflow on the back of profit booking too added to weakness," said Hiren Dhakan, Associate Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio.
Investors were also cautious ahead of the release of Consumer Price Index-based inflation and Index of Industrial Production scheduled on Friday.
A total 11 out of 12 BSE sectoral barometers ended in the red. Market breadth was weak as about 1,750 stocks fell, 1,139 rose and about 100 ended flat.
Bucking the overall weak trend, sugar stocks were in limelight after government fixed higher price for ethanol procurement by PSU oil firms.

New Delhi: In a huge blow to Centre's plans to build a consensus on the Goods and Services Tax, states have opposed the Centre's revised GST draft. The government was hoping to get the legislation passed in the winter session of Parliament.
The government was maintaining that broad agreement had been reached on the bill.
GST was scheduled to be rolled out from April 1, 2016. The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011. The bill has been delayed as states are opposed to loss on account of a unified tax regime.
States have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco be kept out of the purview of the GST. Many states feared that the GST will lead to the loss of revenue.

M&M may buy Saab: But is the M&A strategy working?

Moneycontrol Bureau
Homegrown automobile major Mahindra & Mahindra  is close to striking a deal with the parent company (NEVS) of Swedish carmaker Saab, according to a recent Dow Jones report, which cited court documents submitted in the parent’s bankruptcy case pointing to the Indian company.
If the deal comes through, M&M will become the fourth owner of Saab in as many years (GM, Spyker and current parent NEVS), not counting a near-complete deal when Spyker had to call off its sale to two Chinese automakers at the last moment.
Even as Saab -- best remembered as a automaker that made premium cars with names starting with the number 9 (9-3, 9-5 and so on) and which was said to inspire a small but loyal followers of “intellectuals” -- may have seen some of its brand appeal erode due to the turbulence over the past few years, it is obvious what Mahindra’s strategy is here.
For one, it is NEVS’s focus on electric vehicles that has likely caught the Indian automaker’s attention. As can be seen from M&M’s 2010 buyout of Bangalore electric carmaker Reva, it appears it is one area the company is extremely bullish on. Saab, with an electric prototype of its renowned 9-3 sedan ready, slots right into M&M’s plan.
That said, it also Saab’s former brand appeal, which may have also attracted M&M. A marketing study once labeled Saab’s small but passionate group of owners as having traits it called 'Snaabery’; another expert said a typical Saab owner was 10 times as passionate about their vehicle as the average Volkswagen owner. (It must be remembered that M&M had also bid to acquire Saab when it was put up on the block in 2012.)
Chairman Anand Mahindra was quoted in a Financial Times interview about his focus on acquiring brands thus: "We need brands, because the one thing you cannot build, if you want to grow globally at least—something that can take a lifetime, and we are in a hurry—is brands.”
However, Mahindra also needs to re-look at its aggressive M&A strategy.
In M&M’s previous buys, Reva does not appear to have made significant strides at least on the sales side, though it must be added that the size of the electric car market itself is inhibiting.
Korean automaker Ssangyong, which the carmaker acquired in 2011, continues to bleed though the company is hoping a turnaround takes place after several models planned for launch over the next two years come to the market.
M&M bought out Kinetic in 2008 to gain a foothold into the two-wheeler market but Kinetic’s refurbished scooters Stallio, Rodeo and Duro were not that successful. So much that the company decided to go back to the drawing board and recently launched the Gusto on an all-new non-Kinetic platform.
Recently, it also picked up a majority stake in French Peugeot’s two wheeler company but it is too soon to judge the acquisition.
Previously, M&M had tried, and failed, to buy brands such as Aston Martin, Jaguar Land Rover, Ducati and Saab.
M&M stock price
On January 02, 2015, Mahindra and Mahindra closed at Rs 1224.80, down Rs 11.4, or 0.92 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 1421.00 and the 52-week low was Rs 847.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 58.92 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 20.79. The latest book value of the company is Rs 270.60 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 4.53.

Centre sanctions Rs 228 cr to subsidise canal top solar plantsCentre sanctions Rs 228 cr to subsidise canal top solar plants
M Ramesh
Special Arrangement Canal-top solar plant on the Narmada canal in Gujarat.
Chennai, December 11:  
The Government of India has sanctioned Rs 228 crore to subsidise solar photovoltaic projects built on tops and banks of water canals. Through this grant, the government hopes to help creation of 50 MW of canal top and 50 MW of canal bank solar projects.
Canal-top solar plants have caught the fancy of people ever since American solar major, SunEdison, put the country’s first such plant, of 1 MW capacity on the Narmada canal in Gujarat in 2012 (pictured here). More recently, the Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering built a 10 MW plant again on another branch of the Narmada canal system, near the city of Vadodara.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has assumed a total cost of Rs 975 crore for the 100 MW it wants to help develop – or, Rs 9.75 crore a MW, compared with Rs 11 crore a MW of the 10 MW that Megha Engineering built.
Under the scheme, the government offers Rs 3 crore per MW or 30 per cent of the project cost, whichever lower, for canal-top projects, and Rs 1.5 crore a MW or 30 per cent of the project cost for canal bank projects, says ‘Guidelines for pilot-cum-demonstration project for grid-connected solar PV plants on canal tops and banks’.
The idea is to encourage state power utilities or any other state government organisations or undertakings either on their own or through private sector developers. Central public sector undertakings that operate in the power sector, or have their own canal systems could also apply for the subsidy.
Canal top solar projects come with some significant advantages. First, they are quick to build-SunEdison took four months to build a MW. They prevent evaporation of water, roughly 7 million tonnes a year under the shade of one MW. They waters keep the solar panels cool, which is good for power generation.

No one really knows how long Ebola can live: StudyNo one really knows how long Ebola can live: Study

Washington, Dec 11:  
No one really knows whether the deadly Ebola virus can survive on glass surfaces or counter-tops or how long it remains active in water, wastewater, or sludge, new research has found.
“The World Health Organisation has been saying you can put (human waste) in pit latrines or ordinary sanitary sewers and that the virus then dies,” said Kyle Bibby of the University of Pittsburgh in US.
“But the literature lacks evidence that it does. They may be right, but the evidence isn’t there,” said Bibby.
Bibby and colleagues from Drexel University explain that knowing how long the deadly pathogen survives on surfaces, in water, or in liquid droplets is critical to developing effective disinfection practices to prevent the spread of the disease.
Currently, the World Health Organisation guidelines recommend to hospitals and health clinics that liquid wastes from patients be flushed down the toilet or disposed of in a latrine, researchers said.
However, Ebola research labs that use patients’ liquid waste are supposed to disinfect the waste before it enters the sewage system.
Bibby’s team set out to determine what research can and can’t tell us about these practices.
The researchers scoured scientific papers for data on how long the virus can live in the environment. They found a dearth of published studies on the matter.
“That means no one knows for sure whether the virus can survive on a surface and cause infection or how long it remains active in water, wastewater, or sludge,” researchers said.
The team concluded that Ebola’s persistence outside the body needs more careful investigation.
The study was published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters.

Russia s Rosneft to supply oil to Essar s refineriesRussia's Rosneft to supply oil to Essar's refineries
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 12, 2014 12:30 AM IST
Russia’s Rosneft on Thursday signed an oil and oil products supply deal with Essar Oil  refineries in India. The deal is to supply 10 million tonnes (mt) crude oil per annum for a period of 10 years. Supplies might begin in 2015.
While Essar Oil will secure long-term supply of crude oil, raw material security and products to its refineries, the arrangement will allow Rosneft to expand its distribution area and build deliveries to the region. Head of Rosneft head Igor Sechin and Essar founder Shashi Ruia signed documents on Thursday in New Delhi in this regard.
 Rosneft is the world’s largest public oil and gas company by liquid hydrocarbon production and reserves.
“The agreement opens new horizons of cooperation between the two countries, thanks to the synergistic potential of the partnership in upstream and downstream areas of two leaders of the oil and gas industry of Russia and India. Thanks to this agreement, Rosneft grants itself a secure market outlet of oil and oil products, while Essar gains a reliable and stable partner as a supplier of oil and oil products to its refining facilities,” Essar Oil stated.
Essar Group has also secured a $1-billion credit line from the Russian government controlled VTB Bank. The credit is extended for general corporate purpose, said a statement from the Press Information Bureau.
Analysts said securing crude oil supplies from Russia will help Essar reduce its imports from Iran. Essar is heavily dependent on crude oil imports from Iran for its 400,000 billion barrel per day refinery in Vadinar, Gujarat.

Reliance Industries names former UK judge as its arbitrator in gas dispute

Chief Justice
(RIL gave the name of Rix,…)
NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries has named former UK judge Sir Bernard Rix as its arbitrator in the KG-D6 cost recovery dispute with the government in place of former Chief Justice of India S P Bharucha who quit last week.
RIL gave the name of Rix, who recently retired as Lord Justice of Appeal with 20 years experience in the Commercial Court and the Court of Appeal , earlier this week, sources privy to the development said.
He will sit on a three-member arbitration panel headed by Supreme Court-appointed neutral arbitrator Michael Kirby, a former Judge of an Australian High Court, to decide if the government was right in disallowing over $ 2.3 billion of KG-D6 cost as output lagged targets.
The government has named former Chief Justice of India V N Khare as its arbitrator on the panel.
Sources said Bharucha recused himself from the arbitration after the government challenged his nomination saying that he had not disclosed all previous associations with RIL and that his arbitration could create doubts about his independence and impartiality.
The arbitration which dates back to November 2011 is yet to start as procedural issues were raised.
RIL had challenged the government notice to disallow cost through a Notice of Arbitration on November 23, 2011 saying the signed contract does not provide for output targets and there was no provision for disallowing any part of cost because of production not being in line with output guidance.
The government initially did not join the arbitration within the stipulated 30 days as provided under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) but relented after RIL moved Supreme Court for appointment of the second arbitrator.
However, Justice (rtd) Bharucha and Justice (rtd) Khare failed to agree on the name of the third presiding arbitrator for 13 months and RIL again moved the Supreme Court on August 8, 2013.
Earlier this year, former Australian judge Michael Hudson McHugh was named as the presiding arbitrator but he withdrew after government counsel objected to his remaining on the panel after initially refusing to accept the appointment.
The Supreme Court in September appointed retired judge Michael Kirby of Australia as chairman of arbitral tribunal.
Sources said the government raised objection to Justice Bharucha after two and half years after his appointment.
RIL says it had made full disclosure of all previous dealings with its Arbitrator.
The company had filed a separate arbitration notice on May 9 over delays in approving revision in KG-D6 gas price. For this arbitration, RIL named Sir David Steel and the government named Justice GS Singhvi as their arbitrators.
The two have failed to agree on a third arbitrator and RIL has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking such appointment.

An icy feel to Indo-Russian tiesAn icy feel to Indo-Russian ties
Phunchok Stobdan

Gone is the bonhomie of earlier decades, as India leans towards US. But Russia is too important to be antagonised
Vladimir Putin will spend less than 24 hours in New Delhi when he visits India for the 11th time for the Indo-Russian Annual Summit. He is neither going to address the Indian Parliament, nor will he visit the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant despite Prime Minister Modi’s invitation.
To be sure, at the official level everything seems fine. The two leaders are going to unveil “vision documents” to add to over hundreds of agreements already signed so far --- which actually only exist on paper. Two-way interactions have fallen. Annual trade turnover, targeted to achieve $20 billion by 2015, still hovers around $10 billion. The reasons are well known, but steps to bridge the gaps are not in evidence.
Tangible actions may include implementation of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), through Nhava Sheva via Bandar Abbas to Astarkan, and a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement between India and the Customs Union (CU) of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia.
Both projects are problematic; doing business through Iranian port is neither easy, nor is the CU a happy economic union. Rosneft’s offer of two Siberian oilfields in Vankor and Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye is a significant development, but how OVL will finally take it forward remains a question. It may face stiff competition from China’s CNPC.
A big deal
A significant item that may stamp the visit will be a business deal between India’s Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) and the world’s largest diamond mining company, Alrosa of Russia, for sourcing rough diamonds directly for the diamond processing industry in India. Modi-Putin could possibly make a joint appearance at the World Diamond Congress in New Delhi.
Putin’s visit, however, comes at a time of growing uneasiness in the Indo-Russian relationship. With Russia facing tough international sanctions over Moscow’s standoff with Ukraine, India is unable to help its old friend much, except for taking an ambiguous diplomatic position.
In contrast, China, through a series of big energy deals, is helping Russia ease its economic isolation --- significantly offsetting Russia’s reliance on the European market.
Russia is hugely upset with India’s procurement policy, and unable to digest the US overtaking it as a weapons supplier to India. Many in Moscow are sulking, seeking retribution by ending the arms blockade to Pakistan. A chorus of voices has emerged in the Russian media, saying ‘whom does India stand for — the US or Russia?’
Defence matters
Russia’s decision to forge defence cooperation with Islamabad is not going down well in New Delhi. In a veiled signal, Putin sent his Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to Islamabad weeks before his scheduled visit to New Delhi.
Shoigu promised to translate the Defence Cooperation Agreement into a tangible politico-military understanding, which would include regional security matters. He praised the expertise of Pakistani Armed Forces and said “The world community wants to do business with Pakistan now”.
Of course, courting Islamabad is linked to Moscow’s current international isolation, but it has already sold MI-35 Hind helicopters to Pakistan. The Russian appetite for arms trade with Pakistan could only grow.
Moreover, Russia now sees Pakistan as an important determinant in Afghanistan. Russia’s position however may no longer be identical to India’s. It may go for a more nuanced approach situated somewhere between Indian and Pakistani Afghan policy. The shift of stance could impact regional issues, including Kashmir.
In 2000, Putin told Parliament “the same forces that were creating problems in J&K were behind problems in Chechnya.” This time, Putin has cancelled his address to Parliament citing a busy schedule. Russians are experienced hands at playing around with regional geopolitics. By supporting the entry of India and Pakistan into the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), Moscow may be contemplating a bigger game.
In India, sceptics question the relevance of the history of Indo-Russian ties. The two countries have substantially moved away from each other, as can be seen from divergent pursuits in their foreign and defence policies.
The ‘buyer-seller’ defence transactions are threatened by global competitiveness. India’s disappointment stems from Russian failure to meet delivery schedules, as a result jacking up costs. Besides, there has been a reluctance from the Russian side to transfer technology and supply of unreliable spares. The late delivery of INS Vikramaditya was a case in point.
The story may be repeated over commencement of the stealth Fifth-Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) and the Multi-Role Transport Aircraft (MTA). As it stands, it may take years before production begins.
The question is whether Putin and Modi can straighten the loose ends of existing defence and civil nuclear cooperation projects. Instead of feeling slighted, Russia should update the scope of cooperation.
Strategic ties
Surely Russia would be worried about Modi’s ‘Make in India’ campaign and the proposed Indo-US Defence Trade and Technical Initiatives (DTTI). These moves could free India from import dependency while seeking co-production and co-development with the US in several big-ticket items that are aimed at boosting the Indian economy and security apparatus.
‘Make in India’ hopes to create jobs and make India a competitive exporter.
Clearly, behind Modi’s overt message is the suggestion that Russia is unable to satisfy the growing ‘Make in India’ demand. Russia is using energy as a powerful weapon to counter sanctions by the West.
For New Delhi, only a blockbuster deal – such as laying of a proposed $40 billion long-distance oil and gas pipeline from Russia to India -- can revolutionise trade prospects to touch over $100 billion. Energy diplomacy can replace the waning defence business and reintroduce a sense of balance in Indo-Russian relations.
However, a strategic partnership with Russia cannot be wished away. A country with large stockpiles of strategic bombers and a veto power in the UNSC acts as a useful counterweight against global hegemony. Here, India needs to be mindful about the risks of relying totally on the US in strategic and economic terms, for it could restrict access to civil-military technologies.
New Delhi also cannot ignore geostrategic calculations. Russia’s diplomatic support to India in the context of Kashmir cannot be lost sight of, especially when the traditionally strong US-Pakistan relationship and China-Pakistan nexus still persists.

He was grilled in November on this topic by singer Myleene KlassMyleene Klass says mansion tax would hit little grannies
Myleene Klass says she does not agree with Labour's proposed 'mansion tax'
Balls: Mansion tax 'only for rich'
Ed Miliband has defended plans for a "mansion tax" on homes worth more than £2m after singer Myleene Klass said it would hit "little grannies".
The Labour leader appeared surprised when the ex-Hear'Say star rounded on him in a debate on ITV's The Agenda.
Mr Miliband said the plan was a principled way of raising extra cash for the NHS.
But Ms Klass claimed it would hit old people living in modest homes in London rather than the super-rich.
"For me, what is so disturbing is the name in its own right - mansion," she said.
"Immediately you conjure up in your head these Barbie-esque houses... but in London, which is where 80% of the people who are going to be paying this tax actually live - the South East of England - have you seen what that amount of money can get you? Often it's like a garage.
"When you do look at the people who are going to be suffering this tax, it's true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time.
"The people who are the super-super-rich who are buying their houses for £140m, this is not necessarily going to affect them because they've got their tax rebates and their amazing accountants.
"It's going to be the little grannies that have lived in those houses for years and years."
'Bring on the debate'
Mr Miliband replied that he understood "that people don't like paying more in tax", but he said the plan would raise £1.2bn: "The values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government.
"I say bring on this debate about how we're going to change our country."
Ms Klass replied: "Is that your only option? You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can't just point at things and tax them.
"You need to have a better strategy and say, 'Why is the NHS in this mess in the first place?'"
Sir Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to the US and a pensioner, also weighed into the row, telling Mr Miliband: "You're going to screw me royally."
Last month, shadow chancellor Ed Balls argued that Labour's proposed "mansion tax" would cost £250 a month for those people with homes worth between £2m and £3m.
Concern
He said owners of homes worth "tens of millions" and second-home owners would pay much higher rates of the "progressive" tax, and that the threshold would rise in line with average prices for high-value properties, not inflation.
Mr Balls said "asset-rich, cash poor" homeowners who do not earn enough to pay income tax at 40% would be able to defer payment of the mansion tax until "the property changes hands".
But several Labour MPs in London have expressed concerns about the policy.
It is one of Labour's main 2015 manifesto commitments, with the proceeds due to be used to fund the recruitment of 38,000 new GPs, nurses, midwives and other NHS professionals.
Some Labour candidates for Mayor of London in 2016 have sought reassurances from the party leadership amid concerns that the steep rise in houses prices in London in recent years will see family homes become liable for the tax.
In particular, they have called for safeguards for people on low or middle incomes who bought properties decades ago and have seen their market value rocket.

Karachi: At least 58 Indian fishermen were arrested on Thursday by Pakistani authorities for allegedly violating the country's maritime boundary.
Security forces also confiscated about 10 boats from them, Express Tribune reported. Both Indian and Pakistani fishermen are frequently arrested and detained for fishing in each others waters, as the maritime border in the Arabian Sea is poorly defined.
On November 29, Pakistan released 36 Indian fishermen from Karachi's Malir district jail after they completed their sentence.
Security forces also confiscated about 10 boats from them, Express Tribune reported.
According to Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF) - a representative body of fishermen - at least 423 Indian fishermen are in Pakistani jails and nearly 400 Pakistani fishermen are in Indian jails for many years.

BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj calls Godse a patriot ; retracts laterBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 5:22 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 5:28 pm
BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj was on Thursday at the centre of a controversy when he described Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse as a ‘patriot’, sparking outrage following which he retracted.
The MP from Unnao said, “Godse was an aggrieved person. He may have done something by mistake but was no an anti-national. He was a patriot.”
When his remarks triggered a controversy with demands for action, he retracted saying, “I do not consider him a rashtra bhakta (patriot). I might have said something by mistake.”
Congress Rajya Sabha MP Hussain Dalwai strongly condemned the alleged efforts to ‘glorify’ Godse and demanded arrest of those involved in such exercise.
“A person who has created an example of non-violence in the world and whom we called Father of the Nation was killed by Nathuram Godse,” Dalwai said outside Parliament.
“Now some people are observing Nathuram Godse Shourya Diwas on November 15. It is absolutely wrong and government should arrest them. Why is the government silent on the issue?” he asked.
“Gandhi is accepted by people from all walks of lives including workers, peasants, dalit and women. I have written a letter to the state Chief Minister demanding action against these people,” he said.

Drunk doctor performs family planning operation on five  falls asleep while sixth on operating tableWritten by Ashwani Sharma | Dharmashala |
Posted: December 12, 2014 12:18 am | Updated: December 12, 2014 4:55 am
In a near-repeat of Chhattisgarh sterilization deaths, a drunk doctor performed five sterilization operations and fell asleep, leaving the sixth patient on the operation table in remote Seraj area of Mandi district, Himachal Pradesh.
All five patients who underwent sterilizations are reported to be safe and were discharged on Wednesday. The sixth patient was later rescued by her family members.
Further operations were suspended for the day as family members of patients came to know about the doctor having performed the operations in a drunken state and had left the sixth patient unattended on the operation table at Primary Health Centre (PHC), venue of the sterilization camp at Thunag, 80 km from district headquarters.
In all, there were 67 women registered for the family planning operation in the camp. Out of them, 30 taken-up in the first batch were administered Atropine Injections .
A batch of six patients were taken into the operation room. Due to the doctor’s drunken state he could perform sterilization on only five before he locked himself in a room and fell asleep, leaving the sixth patient unattended. The patient was already administered anaesthesia.
As the next patient was not called in after a long time, the families of the women grew suspicious and questioned the medical staff. It was only after sometime, the staff informed about the “doctor being unwell and taking rest”.
The issue rocked the Himachal Pradesh Assembly when local BJP MLA Jairam Thakur tabled an adjournment motion in the House. The government ordered suspension of Dr Kapil Malhotra and ordered an inquiry into the episode.
“This is a case of gross negligence of the doctor, whose medical examination later confirmed he being in drunken state. It’s sheer luck that all five women who underwent sterilization are safe and no death or medical complication has been reported,” Health Minister Kaul Singh Thakur informed the assembly.
He said a new team of doctors have reached Thunag and, till 1 pm, 25 more sterilizations had been done successfully. All the patients registered for the family planning operation will be looked after by the government.
The health minister, however, claimed that the doctor in question has a good reputation as a government gynecologist and he had already done hundreds of family planning surgeries. “Yet, the government will not spare anyone indulging in such kind of dereliction of duty in the health services, as it’s question of human lives. We have adopted a policy of zero-tolerance in such cases,” said Kaul Singh.
The government, Thakur said, has ordered suspension of the doctor and asked District Programme Officer Dr Praveen Kumar to hold an inquiry.
Earlier, BJP MLA Jairam Thakur raised questions on the state government’s failure alleging that the doctor in question is known for his drinking habit, and during an earlier sterilization camp he had slept on a patient midway in an operation.

tax deals between the governments of LuxembourgEU to investigate Apple's tax affairs
Ireland has been accused of giving special tax treatment to Apple
The European Commission is to open a formal investigation into Apple, Starbucks and Fiat in relation to tax arrangements with three EU countries.
The firms' respective arrangements with Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg will be investigated.
Announcing the move, tax commissioner Algirdas Semeta said that "fair tax competition is essential".
Last year, a US Senate investigation accused Ireland of giving special tax treatment to Apple.
The European Commission will look at whether the companies' tax affairs breach EU rules on state aid.
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: "In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes."
Countries in Europe cannot allow certain firms to pay less tax than they should, Mr Almunia added.
Sanctions
The investigations will focus on "transfer pricing", or whether the countries allowed the multinational firms to charge one part of the company over the odds for goods or services from another part of the company as a way of shifting profits.
Under Commission rules, companies must charge their subsidiaries market rates.
Sanctions for a breach of tax rules could include an attempt to claw money back from Apple, Starbucks and Fiat.
Apple said that it had not had "any special tax deal with the Irish government".
"We have received no selective treatment from Irish officials," the company said. "Apple is subject to the same tax laws as scores of other international companies doing business in Ireland."
The Irish finance ministry said Apple "did not receive selective treatment and there was no 'special tax rate deal'".
"Ireland is confident that there is no state aid rule breach in this case and we will defend all aspects vigorously," the Department of Finance said.
Last year's US Senate committee investigation revealed that Apple had been able to funnel profits into Irish subsidiaries or "ghost companies" that had no declared tax residency anywhere in the world, cutting billions from its tax bill.
The Senate committee hearing revealed that Apple designated its Irish entities as unlimited companies, which meant it did not have to publish annual accounts.
The Irish arrangement allowed Apple to pay just 1.9% tax on its $37bn in overseas profits in 2012, despite the fact the average tax rate in the OECD countries that make up its main markets was 24% last year.
In a 40-page memorandum, the Senate committee said: "Ireland has essentially functioned as a tax haven for Apple."
Starbucks' tax row
Coffee giant Starbucks has been embroiled in a tax controversy for a number of years.
In 2012, the multinational admitted that it had a special tax deal with the Dutch government which allowed it to transfer money to its Dutch sister company in royalty payments.
Starbucks said on Wednesday that its Dutch tax arrangements conformed with financial law.
"We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws and OECD guidelines and we're studying the Commission's announcement related to the state aid investigation in the Netherlands," a Starbucks spokesperson said.
The Dutch finance ministry said it was confident that its tax system was "robust".
"We are confident that the investigation by the EC will in the end result in the conclusion there is no state aid involved," a spokesman told the BBC.
Fiat 'compliant in Luxembourg'
The European Commission is also investigating the tax arrangements of Fiat's financial firm, Fiat Finance and Trade.
Fiat said that while its financial arm is headquartered in Luxembourg, the investigation is into the government concerned.
"We are compliant with all Luxembourg regulations," the company added.
Luxembourg has already riled the European Commission over the firm.
The Commission said on Wednesday that it was launching infringement proceedings against Luxembourg for giving only partial answers to requests for information about Fiat Finance and Trade tax rulings.

Why you should not expect a great salary hike in 2015
Indian companies are likely to keep average salary hikes muted at 11 per cent in 2015, with medical life sciences sector expected to dole out the highest pay raise, says a survey by global consultancy Mercer. According to Mercer's 'Total Remuneration Survey', the actual salary increase across industries and career levels for 2014 stood at 10.6 per cent. With an average salary increase likely to be at 11 per cent, the projected pay hike for next year in medical life sciences sector is the ...

Buy Siyaram Silk Mills; target of Rs 1150: ICICIdirect

ICICIdirect.com's report on Siyaram Silk Mills
"Siyaram Silk Mills’ (Siyaram) Q2FY15 revenues increased 17.6% YoY to Rs 398 crore. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that Siyaram has reported double digit revenue growth. Revenue growth has been driven by realisation growth in the suiting segment and both volume and realisation growth for J Hampstead and cotton brands. The operating margin expanded 58 bps YoY to 12.3% on the back of gross margin expansion and lower employee cost Owing to higher depreciation due to the changes in the Companies Act, PAT growth remained subdued at 19% to Rs 22 crore."
"Siyaram has traded at relatively inexpensive valuations in the past. Hence, we have always said it is a re-rating candidate. Considering that the company is tapping newer opportunities for growth and is spending aggressively on the promotion of its brands, we remain optimistic on its future prospects. Some of its peers in the branded apparel space (with similar fundamentals) are trading at significantly high multiples. We reiterate our BUY rating with a target price of Rs 1150 (based on 8.0x FY17E EPS of Rs 143.6). However, we advise caution while buying owing to low liquidity in such stocks", says ICICIdirect.com research report.

CAD comfortable despite widening  says RajanCAD comfortable despite widening, says Raghuram Rajan
Reuters | Kolkata Dec 11, 2014 05:43 PM IST
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is comfortable with the Current Account Deficit (CAD) even after it widened in the July-September quarter, Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Thursday.
Still, Rajan, speaking at a news conference after the central bank's board meeting, said risks remain to the current account deficit even though he was not apprehensive about it.
India's current account deficit widened to 2.1% of gross domestic product in the July-September quarter, higher than both the previous quarter and a year earlier, the RBI said on Monday.
Turning to the economy, Rajan said an interest rate cut won't by itself lead to higher economic growth, although he noted it would have an impact.
Rajan also noted the central bank was in discussions with the government about reviewing priority sector lending norms for foreign banks operating in India, the governor said.
Turning to limits on foreign investments in government bonds, Rajan said it would look at raising the limit at an appropriate time, and would look at expanding it steadily.

Shopping for Black Friday Deals You Can Do BetterShopping Black Friday 'deals'? You can do better

Sad but true: Black Friday isn't the be-all-end-all sale marketers make it out to be.
Shoppers might have  already missed some of the season's best sales. The Sunday and Monday before Thanksgiving offer bigger price cuts than Black Friday, according to a study from Adobe Systems. Not all is lost, however—the day before Thanksgiving is pretty good, too, as is turkey day itself if you're shopping online.
And if you are planning to shop Black Friday, a little scrutiny can help you avoid some of the so-so deals.
JONATHAN ALCORN / Reuters
Sad but true: Black Friday isn't the be-all-end-all sale marketers make it out to be.
It's also possible to do better than the advertised sales on Black Friday itself. "Absolutely look for stacking opportunities," said Brent Shelton, a spokesman for deal forum FatWallet.com. Some strategies:
Hunt down payment bonuses. The right card can save you more. Target credit card holders get an extra 5 percent off their purchases, for example, and  Discover currently has a 5 percent cash-back bonus on department store and online purchases. Some  mobile wallets are offering credits of up to $30, too. Just don't charge more than you can pay off in full , or interest fees will eclipse those savings.
Tack on coupons. Just because it's Black Friday doesn't mean you shouldn't hunt for coupons and online codes.  Macy's recently sent cardholders coupons for an extra 20 percent off most Black Friday sales; New York & Company mailed offers including an extra 10 percent off on that day.
Use savings malls. Online shoppers can get extra loyalty points or cash back by linking to their favorite stores through a credit card issuer's "mall" or an independent site like  FatWallet.com or  Ebates.com . At FatWallet, deals include an extra 1.5 percent cash back at  Best Buy or 4 percent at  Dell .
Redeem rewards. Using credit card and loyalty points to buy things is often one of the least-valuable redemption options. But  Chase , Citibank , Discover and  American Express have partnerships with Amazon.com that allow you to use rewards to pay for some or all of your orders. (For example, the Chase program offers a preferable rate of a penny per point and Discover allows you to apply cash-back rewards toward Amazon.com purchases.)
Video: Retailers are trying to entice shoppers with super sized holiday sales over an entire week. Could the Black Friday stampede be a thing of the past? NBC’s national correspondent Peter Alexander reports.

Lufthansa Gives Falcons Seat UpgradeLufthansa gives falcons seat upgrade
Harriet Baskas TODAY

Lufthansa's specially designed "Falcon Master" tray will allow first-class passengers to bring their birds on-board with more comfort and less mess.
German airline Lufthansa announced Monday that first-class passengers will soon be allowed to bring falcons in the cabin using a specially designed "Falcon Master" tray.
The ancient sport of falconry is so popular in the Middle East that many commercial airlines in that region allow passengers to bring trained hunting raptors into the main cabin, where the birds travel on a handler’s heavy cuff or tied to an adjacent seat.
“If falconers tried that in the states, people would get all worked up about it,” said Scott McNeff, vice-president of the North American Falconers Association. “But in the Middle East its part of their culture. Everyone understands that and is around it all the time.”
Etihad Airways, Emirates, and Qatar Airways post falcon policies on their websites, as does Royal Jordanian Airlines, which allows up to 15 properly hooded falcons to travel in wide-bodied economy cabins at a per-bird charge of three times the normal excess baggage rate.
With input from falcon specialists, the Executive Jet Solutions division of Hamburg-based Lufthansa Technik designed the “Falcon Master,” an easy-to-assemble and disassemble kit that connects to standard aircraft seat tracks and provides both a stable bird perch and what a company statement describes as stainless steel surfaces that can help “maximize sanitary protection of walls, seats and carpets against dirt produced by the birds.”
A prototype of the product for private jet interiors is currently on display in Dubai, said Ziad al Hasmi from Lufthansa Technik, “and theoretically, it could also be installed in commercial aircraft in the future.”
The price? Depending on the market response and final design, the Falcon Master could sell for about 50,000 EUR, or about $61,760, and be available in the second half of 2015.
“The target market is private and VIP Jet owners especially from the Middle East, who own these precious birds and use them for hunting,” said Lufthansa Technik spokesperson Peter Isendahl.
U.S. airlines don’t allow falcons in the cabins, so Scott McNeff and his fellow falconers usually drive their birds to events and meetings in other regions.
“I’d be content to sit on a plane with my bird on my fist,” said McNeff. “But it would be really nice to have perch on a plane where you can put the bird down, go to sleep and not worry.”

Oils well for paint  fertiliserstocksStreet sees good show after stellar year
Although oil marketers and automobile companies that offer entry-level cars are seen as direct beneficiaries of falling crude oil prices, companies from the chemical, fertilisers and paint industries are also likely to gain indirectly through lower raw material costs.
It is not surprising then that many stocks from these sectors have rallied 50-90% this year with a substantial portion of gains coming in the last six months during which benchmark crude oil prices have dropped more than 40%.
Amid concerns of oversupply, as global Brent crude oil prices nosedive to their lowest in five years ($66.29 per barrel for Brent), companies that use raw materials derived from crude oil and petroleum products could see an expansion to their operating margins.
Click here for graph
Indeed, the trend in operating margins for some of these companies for which crude oil and its derivatives like LNG, fuel oil, suplhur, waxes, petroleum coke, benzene, solvents or emulsifiers account for a substantial portion of raw material costs have expanded in the last six months.
A comparison with the margins of fiscal 2013-14 shows that fertilisers and paint companies have started reflecting the comfort of lower crude oil prices with the expansion in profitability. Operating margins of National Fertilizer, Tata Chemicals, Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals and Kansai Nerolac have grown anywhere between 200 and 400 bps for the first half of FY15 compared to FY14.
However, not all companies have managed to maintain the price momentum, given that the stocks of Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers and Chemicals, Gujarat Alkalies and National Fertilisers have factored in a slowdown in revenue growth of these companies in the first half of this fiscal and lost 8-18% in the last six months when the fall in crude oil prices intensified.
Analysts have also turned upbeat on stocks like GSFC and Tata Chemicals due to company-specific developments like a turnaround in chemicals business, expectations of strong margins in the fertiliser segments for the former and strong performance of domestic business and a restructuring of overseas business for the latter.
However, some analysts are getting wary of the valuations at which most of the paint companies and some fertiliser companies like GSFC are trading, as they believe that the benefits of lower crude oil prices may already have been factored in gains of more than 30% recorded by these stocks in the last six months. The 30-share Sensex has added 11% in the period, taking its year-to-date rally to 32%.

In wake of Uber cabs Delhi rape case  Arun Jaitley says crack down against radio cabs going onIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
In the wake of the shocking Uber cabs Delhi rape case, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has revealed that some radio taxi operators are avoiding service tax payments, forcing the revenue department to take necessary steps, including coercive measures, to recover the dues.
The Revenue Department has imposed service tax on all radio taxi service providers from October 1.
“Some of them have been avoiding it and, therefore, whatever steps are provided within the legislations, including coercive steps in that regard, the Department of Revenue has started taking those steps,” Jaitley said in Rajya Sabha.
He was replying to a question on collection of service tax from radio taxi service providers.
The Minister said that the RBI is not directly concerned with the service tax matters and it is the job of the revenue department to collect taxes.
RBI, the Minister said, was only concerned with the process of payment and authentication of the parties to the transaction.
He said some foreign taxi operators have been seeking time to comply with the payment norms of the RBI, but the central bank has “put its foot down and with effect from December 1, they have been told to completely comply with it.”
“A large number of them are already complying with it. Those who do not comply with it will face the logical consequences,” Jaitley added.
Notices have been given to all the defaulters in the last few months in order to make sure that the payment gateway does not take the payment outside the country, he added.
“RBI has issued a large number of circulars in this regard and compelled most of the people to fall in line. Those who do not fall in line will face the necessary consequences under the Foreign Exchange Management Act,” Jaitley said.
Recently there have been reports of tax dues of certain app-based cab operators, including Uber which is currently in the middle of a controversy over rape of a 27-year-old finance executive allegedly by driver of a taxi booked through it.

India may grow between 5-6% in 2015: Moody sIndia likely to grow between 5-6 per cent in 2015, says Moody's
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 10, 2014  | 20:29 IST

Economy is expected to pick up pace in 2015 and grow in the range of 5 to 6 per cent, helped by strong domestic demand, rating agency Moody's said on Wednesday.
"India will have stronger GDP growth in 2015, which we forecast at 5-6 per cent, up from around 5 per cent in 2014", Moody's said in a report titled - 2015 Outlook-Global Credit Conditions.
The country, it said, has benefited from a strong domestic demand base and diversified export markets that give protection from the effects of a slowing Chinese economy and muted growth in the euro zone and Japan.
"Employment and consumption are likely to rise in India, and the fall in global commodity prices will help to lower high inflation in the country", Moody's said.
As per official estimates, economic growth in the current fiscal ending March 2015 would be between 5.4 and 5.9 per cent.
The growth had slumped to sub-5 per cent in the earlier two consecutive fiscals. It also projected that corporates would see improved cash flows on account of acceleration in manufacturing activity.
However, Moody's outlook on the banking system remains negative as it expects poor asset quality to require continued provisioning and strengthened capital buffers.
"Our outlook for the Indian banking system remains negative, reflecting high leverage in the corporate sector that will inhibit any meaningful recovery in asset quality, notwithstanding a moderate rebound in economic growth", it added.

Retirement: when you should apply for Social Security1
First, the basics. The maximum benefit for someone retiring at full retirement age in 2015 (66 for those born in 1943 through 1954) is $2,663 a month, or $31,956 a year. If each spouse in a married couple qualified for the maximum, they would receive nearly $64,000 a year. And benefits are automatically adjusted each year to keep up with inflation. (For 2015, the cost-of-living hike is 1.7 percent.)
You are eligible for benefits as long as you have worked at least 10 years in jobs or self-employment covered by Social Security. Your personal benefit will be based on two main variables: your earnings in the 35 highest-paid years of your career and your age when you start receiving your benefits. You can sign up for Social Security as early as age 62, but your benefit will be cut by about 25 percent to 30 percent compared with what you'd receive at full retirement age. For people born after 1954, full retirement age gradually rises; for those born in 1960 and later, it's age 67. The later your full retirement age, the bigger the hit if you claim benefits at 62. If, however, you wait to claim Social Security until after your full retirement age, you'll be rewarded with delayed-retirement benefits that boost your payout by 8 percent a year up to age 70.
The third variable in your claiming strategy is your marital status. Married couples have an arsenal of extra strategies that can boost benefits, and they don't necessarily end with divorce or the death of a spouse.
One other thing: To select the strategy that's right for you, you must give serious thought to some difficult and sobering questions, such as how long you think you'll live. The longer you live, the longer you're expected to live, and life expectancies have been gradually increasing. The latest government statistics show that men alive at age 65 are expected to live to age 82.9; women of the same age are expect to live to age 85.2.
Claiming Social Security at age 62 makes sense if you think you won't live very long. But if you're healthy and have a family history of longevity (especially on your mother's side), it's a reasonable bet that the bigger benefits earned by delaying will pay off handsomely.

The Pirate Bay website was taken down after Swedish police seized servers and computers from a server room in Stockholm.
According to a report by Wired, it is unsure if the website was taken down for hosting some of the movies leaked due to the recent cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.
"We had a crackdown on a server room in Greater Stockholm because of a copyright infringement, and yes it was Pirate Bay," Paul Pinter, national coordinator, intellectual property crime at Stockholm County Police told Reuters.
Other file-sharing sites that were also offline include EZTV, Zoink, and Torrage, as was Pirate Bay's forum Suprbay.org.

Dancing with the menUpdated: December 10, 2014 18:41 IST
Dancing with the men
For the love of it: Dancer Jayakumar
Dancer Arun Prakash
dance personalities
It is still unusual to find men taking to classical dance, but those who do wonder what the big deal is
When I hear the sounds of anklets approaching as I wait inside Sri Saraswathi Kalalaya, a classical dance school, I expect to see a woman, but to my surprise A. Arun Prakash appears.
He is a dancer, he says, and performs in many stage shows and inter-collegiate and national-level competitions. He has won many accolades for his performances. Sweat trickling down his forehead, Arun who trains in the Pandanallur style of dance, talks of his nine years in classical dance, with the bright eyes and bhavanai of a professional classical dancer. He started learning dance under his guru Natyamani. S. Murali.
Was he conscious of the fact that dance is usually seen as something girls pursue? The 22-year-old laughs. Art is for human beings and it has no gender bias, he says. “Dance to me is not just an art but also a physical, mental and divine exercise”. Arun has a post-graduate degree in Commerce, but dance is his passion.
For 44-year-old S. Jayakumar, classical dance became a profession, after he obtained a diploma in Mechanical Engineering! He narrates the fierce objection he had to face from his family. They felt he wouldn’t make enough money from dance, and worried that no woman would marry a male classical dancer. Jayakumar disproved all that and today he runs a dance academy with 80 students and is happily married to J. Kanjanadevi. His two sons are also interested in dance. Kanjanadevi laughs and confesses that she was shocked when she first saw him wear anklets, an angavasthram and jewellery to work!
“Today I feel proud that I am his wife and that I can support such a beautiful art.” One of Jayakumar’s students is Sankar Bharan Kumar who studied aeronautical engineering before taking up dance seven years ago and is fiercely proud of his Yuva Kala Bharathi Award by Bharathi Yuva Kendra, Madurai. He says, “Many men today think dancing western styles is more fashionable. That has led them to think that classical dance is meant for women.”
The male dancers point out that the Rudra Thandavam of Lord Nataraja holds the origins of classical dance. Many dancers, both men and women, look forward to performing in front of the male God. Then why is it something that is regarded as a ‘woman thing,’ they ask. Tradition is not something that only a woman carries forward.

McDonald's slimming down menu as it tries to fatten up sales
McDonald's will slim down an admittedly bloated menu and try to eliminate preservatives from its food as part of a broad push to stem what its CEO on Wednesday called the "erosion" of sales in its U.S. business.
The world's largest restaurant company has to be more nimble to keep up with competitors that have been quicker to respond to customers' tastes, executives said during an investor conference at the company's Oak Brook headquarters. That means everything from speeding up internal tests and doing more to appeal to diners who are looking for cleaner labels on what they eat, to having franchisees do more community outreach.

McDonald's food you can't get here
It's been 59 years since McDonald's became synonymous with burgers and fries in the U.S. Now it has more than 34,000 stores in 118 countries. Here's what you can find at Mickey D's around the world:
"We are not going to re-energize this business by taking incremental steps," said Mike Andres, who became president of McDonald's USA two months ago.
The updates outlined by Andres and CEO Don Thompson include removing eight items from a menu with more than 100 food items and dozens of drinks, and trimming the number of Extra Value Meals to 11 from 16. Such moves could make it easier for customers to figure out what they want to order while also reducing complexity in the kitchen.
The company has been testing the streamlined menu in Delaware; Little Rock, Ark.; Waco, Texas; Bakersfield, Calif.; Macon, Ga., and Knoxville, Tenn., a spokeswoman said.
8
The menus, for example, offer one Quarter Pounder with cheese, rather than four versions; one Snack Wrap instead of three; and one Premium Chicken sandwich instead of three. The company would not confirm which items will be eliminated from the menu in January, though Andres said a version of a McWrap could be on the chopping block.
The McWrap, in particular, has been flagged as an item that often takes too long to prepare.
How fast the changes can be executed is key, one analyst said. On Monday, McDonald's posted its worst monthly U.S. sales in more than 13 years.
"The early response from consumers is encouraging, but it's going to take time to execute," said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy, who attended the meeting.
@poppy coq Agree that sitting down is a preferred way to eat a meal. McDonalds is not for that. It is for a quick bite on the run. Agree for a quality meal, I am not going to McDonalds.

McDonald's has been trying to shake up the U.S. organization for several quarters, as sales have suffered while rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chick-fil-A and others post gains. In October, McDonald's wooed Andres back to run the business, marking the second change in the high-profile spot in less than two years.
Andres said that adding more than 100 items to the menu over the past decade helped increase sales, touting that the items added $770,000 to sales at an average restaurant. However, the more complex menu also made it difficult for restaurants to execute "and maybe difficult to order," he said.
The company already announced a new, four-zone organizational structure for the U.S. business as it wants to let local operators make more of their own decisions. Now, Andres is mapping out seven broad plans, ranging from improving the internal culture to creating what the company is calling the McDonald's of the future.
Andres pledged that McDonald's would also offer food that is "more culinary inspired" and sell items with shorter ingredient lists and fresher ingredients.
"Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?" Andres asked rhetorically. "We probably don't."
He said McDonald's is defending its food from "absurd questions" and that despite its critics, the brand's image is improving among key consumers such as millennials and moms.
"The brand is fine," Andres said.
Outside findings suggests the company has much work to do.
Research firm dunnhumbyUSA on Wednesday said McDonald's came in 10th place in its fast-food Customer Centricity Index, which it said tracks customer perceptions of how well restaurants meet their needs and wants. In-N-Out Burger, Chick-fil-A and Culver's took the top three spots.
On Thursday, rival Yum Brands, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, holds its own analyst and investor meeting in New York. Late Tuesday, Yum cut its profit forecast for the year, and its shares fell 6.3 percent on Wednesday. McDonald's shares declined 1.5 percent.
Activist hedge fund Jana Partners, which disclosed a stake of more than 842,000 shares in McDonald's in November, declined to comment on Wednesday's presentation.
McDonald's said Monday that it was trying to bring its "create your taste" ordering system to about 2,000 of its U.S. restaurants by the end of next year, or roughly 1 in 7 locations. Thompson stressed on Wednesday that "create your taste," which has already rolled out across Australia, is no longer a test effort. "This is a rolling implementation now," he said.
McDonald's worldwide same-restaurant sales declined 2.2 percent in November, the company reported Monday. The drop was steeper than Wall Street anticipated and marked its sixth consecutive monthly decline. The biggest drop came in the United States, where same-restaurant sales fell 4.6 percent, the steepest U.S. drop since June 2001. McDonald's U.S. same-store sales have not increased since October 2013.

Satellites to assess coral reef health

Special Arrangement
ON THE ALERT: Continuous monitoring through the advisories issued by INCOIS would enable the authorities to prepare bleaching response plans.
TOPICS
science and technology
High-end satellite technology is coming to the aid of protecting earth’s largest biological structures — the coral reefs which have taken millions of years to form and are declining at alarming rates worldwide.
Coral bleaching is one of the main reasons for increased deterioration of reef health. Corals are sensitive to changes in temperature and this aspect has come in handy for scientists to forewarn about the possibility of coral bleaching. When exposed to higher temperatures over an extended period of four to five weeks, the corals bleach and this in turn affects the marine ecosystem.    Scientists at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) are using satellite technology to glean data on Sea Surface Temperatures (SST). Based on an average temperature for a particular period, they assess if the coral reefs are facing thermal stress  and forewarn about the probability of bleaching.
Once they start bleaching, the corals expel the symbiotic organism (zooxanthellae) from which they derive food and die as a result. “Corals act as breeding and feeding ground for a variety of fishes. Corals are the forests of oceans,” said Dr. T. Srinivasa Kumar, Head of the advisory service and satellite oceanography group.
Exploiting the potential of satellite technology, INCOIS has started the Coral Bleaching Alert System (CBAS) for Indian coral reefs located in Andaman & Nicobar Islands and elsewhere in India.
It is also issuing coral bleaching advisories regularly on a bi-weekly basis and hosting the information on its website, besides providing it to the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests and other coastal authorities.
According to R.S. Mahendra, scientist at INCOIS, coral reef ecosystems have been declining at an alarming rate worldwide in recent decades. He said various parameters like SST climatology, bleaching HotSpot (HS) and Degree of Heating Weeks (DHWs) are used to generate the data by using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor on-board National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites.
Dr. Mahendra said continuous monitoring through the advisories issued by INCOIS would enable the authorities to prepare bleaching response plans and also better manage interactions leading to coral bleaching.
According to Dr. Kumar, satellite data on ocean colour and sediment deposits were also being used to monitor the health of corals. 
INCOIS in collaboration with Space Application Centre carried out mapping of the coral reefs of India. Eco-morphological zonation of coral reefs has been generated using Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite data on 1:25000 scales for Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Gulf of Kachchh, Malvan and Gulf of Mannar. 
These maps provide baseline information on coral area and eco-morphological diversity.

User Experience: Hygiene or Strategic Differentiatorreddit
There's no doubt that some people in some situations will pay more for goods and services if they are wrapped in enjoyable experiences. The question for you is whether these user experiences are hygiene or strategic differentiators in your particular case. Know that and you'll know where you must play not to lose and where you should play to win.
A generation ago Pine and Gilmore began a discussion about The Experience Economy. Their core thesis was that the progression of economic value had moved through extracting commodities, making goods and delivering services to staging experiences. Most recently Comrade CEO Thelton McMillian told me that user and customer experience together are the way organizations of the future will compete. To bolster his case he cites a Gartner survey's findings that "by 2016, 89% of companies expect to compete mostly on the basis of customer experience, versus 36% four years ago."
He's wrong.
It's a red herring.
Comrade focuses on financial services. As McMillian explained to me, "user and customer experience is relatively undifferentiated across banks and credit unions. From a customer's perspective the experience they have is synonymous with the brand, and the brand is the true differentiator"
McMillian suggests the learning from their successes is that culture, processes and technology "all must come together to deliver on a higher level of customer experience, and a brand promise."
Of course good user and customer experience is important. And some businesses can and should differentiate based on superior customer experience. But in the vast majority of cases these are merely hygiene factors, which, as Herzberg taught us, cause dissatisfaction if they aren't good enough, but do not increase satisfaction if you over-deliver.
The difference is whether the experience is the benefit. Certainly for some forms of entertainment like theaters and amusement parks, the experience is the benefit. Others, like some restaurants blur the line. As Pine and Gilmore said, "you are what you charge for". But you don't have to charge an admission fee or cover charge to be charging for your experience. The Ledoyen restaurant in Paris sells glasses of wine for six times as much as it costs them. They are most definitely charging for the experience.
Missed hygiene factors cost you customers. When Frontier took over AT&T's local Connecticut business a month ago, large numbers of customers experienced service outages. Frontier at first claimed the hand-over had gone smoothly (which it had not) and then took weeks to fix some of the problems. They tried to apologize by giving some afflicted customers $50 credits. Way too little way too late. They lost business by failing to deliver, failing to respond and then failing to win back customers' confidence. They just didn't seem to care.
However, whether it's hygiene or a satisfier, it's worth getting it right and certainly worth avoiding getting it wrong by what McMillian describes as The 7 deadly sins of digital user experience:
LUST: It's easy to lust over design and fall prey to "shiny objects." Focus on solving the customer's problem instead.
GLUTTONY: Over-indulgence often manifests itself in the design process as the dreaded "feature creep." Focus on the few most important features for the user.
GREED: Don't get distracted by short-term return on investment. Instead, build an enduring culture of design and customer-centered thinking in your organization.
SLOTH: Laziness at any point can lead to usability issues or broken interaction. Test usability and desirability often and continually.
WRATH: Understanding customer frustrations is the first step in fixing your user experience whether it's lost voice mail, connectivity or anything else.
ENVY: Find your own groove, differentiate your experience from competitors and use what you've seen as inspiration to push boundaries and innovate.
PRIDE: Don't be too proud that you don't consider making changes in response to an ever-evolving market. There is no such thing as a finished product.
Net, differentiate on what you can charge for; but don't fail on hygiene factors.

Posner v. Posner on granting rights of free speech to school kidsRon Collins’s extensive and revealing interview of Judge Richard Posner continues at Concurring Opinions — today it’s on free speech . (Here’s my previous post .)
Here’s one exchange that struck me:
Question: You pride yourself on being a “balancer,” as one who compares the social pluses and minuses of restrictions on free speech. Can you be an effective balancer absent a reliable record of the actual or even conjectural harms and benefits of speech? And what if the lawyers, as if often the case, tender no reliable empirical evidence one way or the other? Who wins, where is the conceptual default? Or must the reviewing court do its own research to resolve the question?
Posner: I don’t know how much empirical work has been done on the subject. In its absence, there is just guesswork, although the basic structure of American free speech law seems okay. Some of it strikes me as silly, notably granting rights of free speech to school kids.
Why did the last line strike me? Because of a very succinct and interesting defense of the free-speech rights of children that I remember reading in college — by Judge Posner. Here it is:
Children have First Amendment rights.  Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-14 (1975);  Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District, 393 U.S. 503, 511-14 (1969).   This is not merely a matter of pressing the First Amendment to a dryly logical extreme.   The murderous fanaticism displayed by young German soldiers in World War II, alumni of the Hitler Jugend, illustrates the danger of allowing government to control the access of children to information and opinion.   Now that eighteen-year-olds have the right to vote, it is obvious that they must be allowed the freedom to form their political views on the basis of uncensored speech before they turn eighteen, so that their minds are not a blank when they first exercise the franchise.   And since an eighteen-year-old’s right to vote is a right personal to him rather than a right that is to be exercised on his behalf by his parents, the right of parents to enlist the aid of the state to shield their children from ideas of which the parents disapprove cannot be plenary either.   People are unlikely to become well-functioning, independent-minded adults and responsible citizens if they are raised in an intellectual bubble.
That’s Judge Posner’s opinion for the Seventh Circuit in American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick , a case about violent video games that was later cited by the Supreme Court when it reached a similar conclusion , and is mentioned in the introduction to the interview.
Now it could well be that Judge Posner’s views here are all consistent — he does say “school kids” in the recent interview (emphasis mine). And although he doesn’t spell any of this out, it could be that he has in mind a specific skepticism about the value of free speech rights at school, while kids presumably play video games elsewhere. But in any case I thought it was worth providing the context of his earlier analysis.

Police discover a man living in the ceiling of a Denver restaurant ... which is more common than you might thinkBy Peter Holley December 10, 2014 Follow @peterjholley
A man who was apparently living above a chain restaurant in Denver crashed through the ceiling and had to be pulled from a wall by responders, according to reports.
“There was moaning coming from one of the walls to the right of the front doors,” James Ballinger of the Denver Police Department  told the ABC affiliate . “When crews removed one of the booth’s seats, they could see the man’s feet behind the wall.”
There’s more: The incident this week at the downtown Yard House restaurant triggered a massive flood, which caused “significant water damage,” the station reported . The man, whose name wasn’t immediately released, was taken to an area hospital after the fall. Ballinger told the station that “it appeared that he had been staying up there for a while.”
The man has been charged with burglary, police spokesman Ron Hackett said Wednesday.

“I have not seen a call like this ever,” Ballinger told KUSA, the NBC affiliate .
Actually, this kind of thing happens more often than you’d think.
For example:
• In 2013, a group of Ohio State University students noticed that the doors to their microwave and cupboards were mysteriously being left open. The culprit, it turned out, was a man named Jeremy, who was living behind a locked basement door in the off-campus house.
“I mean, he was a really nice guy, like, I feel bad for him,” one of the housemates told the Lantern , “but it’s just, you know — he wasn’t supposed to be living there.”
• Earlier this year, a man was found staying in the Duke University Student Center. “ Police were alerted to his presence after employees reported a strong smell of burning incense ,” WNCN reported.
• A few months later, a man was discovered living in the support beams of New York’s Manhattan Bridge, according to the New York Post . The crawl space inside the support beam was 10 feet long and a foot-and-a-half wide — just big enough to fit a human body and a large amount of supplies.

Sensex  Nifty plunge in early trade on global sell-offComments
Continuing the downward trend, markets fell to their six-week lows on Thursday on sharp losses in RIL and ONGC shares, after a further drop in global crude oil price.
The benchmark Sensex plunged 229.09 points, or 0.82%, to end at 27,602.01 while the NSE Nifty declined 62.75 points, or 0.75%, to 8,292.90.
The benchmark index has fallen 863 points in the last eight trading sessions.
“Mixed sentiment on the back of a weak rupee and lower oil prices added to the volatility. Foreign outflows on the back of profit-booking also added to the weakness,” said Hiren Dhakan, associate fund manager, Bonanza Portfolio.
Major Sensex losers included ONGC (down 3.21%), Tata Steel (down 2.85%) and Bharti Airtel (down 2.77%).
The Sensex has risen 40% since January and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been leading the rally. However, on Wednesday alone, FIIs sold $36 million worth of stocks.
Global crude oil prices fell to $64.24 a barrel, after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries said there would not be any cut in output, despite the fall in demand from the US, the world’s largest consumer.
Experts have said that a fall in oil prices will hit markets. Sovereign wealth funds, which account for a majority of FII inflows into India, will be left with little surplus capital to allocate if oil prices fall further, Credit Suisse MD Neelkanth Mishra had said.

Invest with caution in European  Chinese fundsTanvi Varma      Follow @vtanvi    Edition: December 2014

Early this year, when some funds launched schemes for investing in European companies, they hoped the region's shares would do well. But things have not turned out as expected. The European economy slowed for the fourth straight month in September (it grew 0.1% compared to 0.3% in the previous two quarters).
"The core economies of the euro zone such as Germany, France, Italy and Greece, which were recovering late last year, have slowed," says Feroze Azeez, director and head, Investment Products, Anand Rathi Private Wealth. Greece, in recession for the last six years, barring the last one, is facing turmoil on political as well as economic fronts. Germany, the zone's largest economy, is also slowing. Its economy shrank 0.20% in the second quarter.
To put this in perspective, the gross domestic product, or GDP, growth in the euro area averaged 0.35% a year from 1995 to 2014, reaching a high of 1.30% in the second quarter of 1997 and a record low of -2.80% in the first quarter of 2009. There were signs of revival till a few quarters ago.
"Negative news such as default on bonds by Argentina, tensions between Russia and Ukraine and concerns over debt have also impacted markets," says Ashish Kehair, head, Private Wealth Management, ICICI Securities.
Because of these factors, in the sell-off earlier this month, EU markets were the worst hit (down 10-12%). "Further, India's current account deficit has improved significantly, strengthening the rupee and, in turn, lowering returns from international funds in rupee terms," says Manish Gunwani, senior fund manager, ICICI Prudential AMC. In the last one year, the rupee has risen 8% against the euro.
REPORT CARD
Three-month returns of Franklin India Feeder-Franklin European Growth Fund are -12.16% while Religare Invesco Pan European Equity Fund has returned a negative 9.16%.
International equity funds
But one must remember that three months is too short a period to judge a fund's performance. Investors must consider returns over three-five years. For instance, Franklin India Feeder-Franklin European Growth Fund has been around since December 2000 and has seen investors through many market cycles. It has been outperforming its benchmark by at least 200 basis points a year for the past five years.
A BACKGROUNDER
The year 2013 was not as gloomy. To start with, fears over tapering of quantitative easing, or QE, by the US Fed triggered a sell-off in emerging markets and, hence, flight of funds to developed markets. "In 2013, the euro zone appeared to be on the path of revival with peripheral regions such as Greece and Portugal recovering their cost competitiveness and leading economies like Germany reporting good export growth," says Gunwani.
According to a Franklin Templeton report, while Europe went into a recession after the 2008 financial crisis, steps taken by the European Central Bank, or ECB, and individual governments helped. Earnings growth rebounded to 7% in 2013 compared to 1.8% in 2012 and -2% in 2010 and 2011. Europe's stock markets returned 22% in 2013 while the US ones returned 30%.
However, in 2014, in spite of the ECB turning dovish, growth petered out to almost zero. This combined with high valuations to put pressure on European markets.
Also, in 2014, global markets absorbed the impact of QE tapering. Then, the Fed's stance that it will keep interest rates low for a considerable time led to re-initiation of risk-on trades. This, along with improved macroeconomic indicators, made investors confident about emerging markets.
"While US markets have continued to rally due to strong economy and sustained growth, the EU region is struggling with geo-political concerns and low inflation," says Kehair of ICICI Securities.
FUTURE WORRIES
Performance of European markets will depend upon economic recovery and growth in corporate earnings, rather than re-rating, as was the case last year. Vetri Subramaniam, chief investment officer, Religare Invesco Mutual Fund, is positive on the region. On the macroeconomic front, data are varied, indicating that the recovery may have slowed but is still on track. "Countries in the periphery continued their noteworthy improvement, with strong manufacturing growth in Spain and Italy, and better unemployment trends. The ECB measures have been welcomed by investors and are supportive of growth," he says.
Gunwani differs. He says Europe's long-term growth is unlikely to be high as it faces serious challenges related to ageing population and sovereign debt. "Having said that, the euro has fallen almost 10% against the dollar, which may help arrest the fall in growth," he says.
Currency woes
FUND RETURNS
Returns have been falling across global equity funds. When compared to the Indian markets, in the last one year (27 October 2013 to 27 October 2014), equity international funds have been the worst performing among equity funds, retuning -2.2%. The BSE Sensex rose 29% during the period. Funds focusing on China have also been flat for the last one year. After registering close to double-digit growth for more than three-and-a-half decades, China's economy, too, seems to be slowing. Its GDP expanded 1.9% QoQ in the third quarter of 2014 after a rise of 2% in the second quarter. On a year-on-year basis, the economy expanded 7.3% in the third quarter of 2014, down from 7.5% in the previous period and 12% in 2010.
DON'T HOLD BACK
Investors must not shy away from global funds as all markets go through cycles. One can definitely invest in offshore funds for diversification and gain from currency depreciation. Kehair prefers US funds over the EU ones right now due to the former's better near-term fundamentals. Gunwani is also of the opinion that the US is a good hedge for India.
Azeez concurs with this view and says that considering that growth is picking up in the US he would not recommend investors to invest in international markets at this point of time since Indian markets are attractively valued and the return potential is high.
First-time investors should consider diversified international funds that are agnostic to geography and follow a bottom-up approach to equity investing. However, the investment call is more a part of asset allocation/portfolio diversification strategy. So, exposure of up to about 10% of the equity portfolio can be taken in markets that have a low correlation with the fortunes of emerging markets like India.

City approves plan for app that helps taxis compete with Uber  ridesharing services8
The Chicago ordinance commits the city to developing a mobile app that will serve as a dispatch for all the city's taxicab companies. Rideshare companies including Uber and smaller rival Lyft offer dispatch of a variety of cars, and in some markets the Uber app can call taxis.
It is not yet determined how the Chicago mobile app will be administered, who will pay for it, and whether rideshare services would be able to bid for the contract to develop or run it.
Chicago appears to be the only major city to agree to develop its own app, although New York City Council Member Ben Kallos this week proposed a similar app. The Chicago move also represents a political push from the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a union which has organized drivers in two cities so far.
More than half of Chicago's 7,000 active cabbies have joined AFSCME since June. In New Orleans, the second U.S. city where AFSCME has organized taxi drivers, more than 800 drivers have signed up, which represents more than half of the city's fleet.
Cheryl Miller, a Chicago taxi driver for 20 years, says the rideshare issue was key to making drivers organize this year. She says the app might serve to increase her customer base, but she says the more pressing issue is increased regulation and accountability of Uber drivers.
"I see this as a first step. I'm excited about that," she says.
cComments
So, if I've got this straight, the unions, that have these parasitic aldermen in their back pocket, have successfully bent over the taxpaying citizens of this city to, once again, give them the shaft. Moreover, what business does the city council have in using taxpayer money to level a...

Russian officials declined to comment, but a senior diplomat arrived with Mr. Aksyonov for the meeting to sign a memorandum with a business group called the Indian-Crimean Partnership.
The Prime Minister of Crimea, the former Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia, arrived for unofficial talks in New Delhi on Thursday as President Vladimir Putin met Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a summit.
Sergey Aksyonov met a Mumbai businessman to discuss boosting trade with the Black Sea region. India does not support Western sanctions against Russia, but the meeting may prove an irritant before President Barack Obama visits India in January.
Russian officials declined to comment, but a senior diplomat arrived with Mr. Aksyonov at an upscale New Delhi hotel for the meeting to sign a memorandum with a business group called the Indian-Crimean Partnership.
Gul Kripalani, a seafood merchant who chairs the group, told Reuters before the meeting that it was unofficial, but added that Mr. Aksyonov "happened to be on the flight with His Excellency President Putin".
A spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs said he was not officially aware of the Crimean visit and that Mr. Aksyonov was not a member of Putin's delegation.
India has made it clear that it would not support Western sanctions against Russia imposed over the annexation of Crimea in February, and the Kremlin's support for an armed uprising in by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.

SBI chief: Leave it to banks to decide on mergersSBI chief: Leave it to banks to decide on mergers

New Delhi, Dec 11:  
The Centre must leave it to the public sector banks themselves to decide on the consolidation candidates, SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya has said.
“It is important to start conversations among banks as to who should merge with whom," she said at the Delhi Economics Conclave 2014 here on Thursday.
There is need for India to work towards 3-4 large banks through consolidation, she added.
This remark is in line with the earlier UPA regime’s policy stance of allowing banks on their own to come up with proposals for consolidation among themselves.
As on date, the Modi-led Government has no stated policy on consolidation of banks.
Indications are that upcoming Budget in February may spell out the new dispensation’s policy stance on bank consolidation and may even come up with some “big ticket” announcements on likely mergers.

FMC increases open interest limit in 18 commoditiesFMC increases open interest limit in 18 commodities
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 10:31 PM IST
The Forward Markets Commission (FMC), the commodity markets regulator, has increased the open interest (OI) limit in 18 commodities, after market participants requested it to do so, as the existing position limits were impacting the liquidity and depth of the market.
Client-level open position limit in rapeseed and mustard seed has been doubled to 30,000 tonnes and soybean to 60,000 tonnes.
FMC has increased OI limit in gold to five tonnes from three tonnes currently; in silver, open interest has been increased to 100 tonnes from 60 tonnes. In copper, it has been increased to 7,000 tonnes from 5,000 tonnes.
In the agri space, OI limit for refined soy oil has been increased to 35,000 tonnes from 25,000 tonnes. In castor seed, it has been increased to 12,000 tonnes from 8,000 tonnes and in cotton it has been increased to 1,50,000 bales from 65,000 bales.
“This will have a positive impact as the depth in the market will increase. Hedger participation will also improve,” said Naveen Mathur, associate director of commodities and currencies at Angel Broking.

After a long hiatus  Manmohan Singh to speak On economyAfter a long hiatus, Manmohan Singh to speak On economy
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 04:44 PM IST
Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will break his long silence  on Friday when he talks on the economy at a memorial lecture. 
Singh has not made  any significant statement  on the economy ever since  he relinquished the office in May this year, though he did talk of Nehruvian economics on the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of the  first prime minister of the country and take a dig at "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" of his successor Narendra Modi in Kerala last month, besides talking about skilled workforce.
Singh will deliver an inaugural address on 'India's Growth Trajectory in a Fractured World Economy: Opportunities and Challenges".  
It will be interesting to see if the former economist prime minister takes  on so-called 'Modinomics'. 
India's economy did recover from sub-5 per cent growth of 2012-13 and 2013-14, but it was not a phenomenal recovery. Though India's economic growth rose to 5.5 per cent in the first half of the current financial year, investment recovery is yet to take place and the current account deficit is again on the rise.   
The address will be part of Bharat Ram Memorial Seminar, to be organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and Shri Ram Centre for Industrial Relations, Human Resources, Economic and Social Development. 
The keynote address will be delivered by RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan. 

Average salary hikes to be at 11% in 2015: M...india business
(According to Mercer's 'Total…)
NEW DELHI: Indian companies are likely to keep average salary hikes muted at 11 per cent in 2015, with medical life sciences sector expected to dole out the highest pay raise, says a survey by global consultancy Mercer.
According to Mercer's 'Total Remuneration Survey', the actual salary increase across industries and career levels for 2014 stood at 10.6 per cent.
With an average salary increase likely to be at 11 per cent, the projected pay hike for next year in medical life sciences sector is the highest (12 per cent) and for the shared services and hi-tech industry it is lowest (10 per cent).
While the pay increases have been muted, a majority of companies have indicated aggressive recruitment activity in the next year on expectation of higher growth rate, the survey findings showed.
The survey covered 700 organisations in the country across various industry sectors like medical life sciences, chemical, oil and gas, manufacturing and engineering, automobiles and auto components, shared services and hi-tech sector.
"Overall, the current pay increase forecasts indicate that while business sentiment is positive, companies await the sentiment to turn into actual business results before taking aggressive pay actions," Mercer India Business Leader (Information Solutions) Shanthi Naresh said.
"In industry context, the organisation and specific roles are continuing to drive reward decisions," Naresh added.
Even companies which are forecasted to dole out lower than average salary hike "are using their discretion to differentiate and reward high performers with slightly higher pay increases in order to aid retention," Naresh said.
Mercer also found that the overall actual attrition in 2013 across industries was 10.3 per cent with the highest attrition in the hi-tech sector at 15 per cent. By comparison, attrition stood at 6.5 per cent as on June 2014.
According to the survey, engineering, sales and research and development functions continue to remain the most difficult functions to hire and retain talent.

He did not give a definite outlook for FY15 revenue growth but said the company was doing extremely well and has become one of the largest education solutions providers in the country and also one of the largest exporters of books.
The company also has aggressive capex plans for the next fiscal, he said.
Below is the transcript of Mukesh Dhruve’s interview with Reema Tendulkar & Ekta Batra on CNBC-TV18
Reema: How does the decline in crude price benefits the company?
A: Repro India is in the education value business, where we are providing value-added solutions to all our large MNC publishers. We are dealing with all the global publishers which include people like Pearson, Macmillan Publishers, Oxford, and Cambridge so on. We have the content with us, which we digitally warehouse and invest in that. We are dealing with them in India as well as outside India which is where your question will be answered specifically.
Since the content is with us we take care of their entire requirements within India which is pan-India as well as outside India where we are covering about 22 countries in Africa where we are exporting our books today.

Its means a 360 degree multisensory solution or preloaded books available on the tablets.
Ekta: On a point that you do publishing work, how would the paper prices be impacted because of crude and hence what sort of impact would that have on your margin?
A: If I have to look at crude does not directly impact us but at the global level definitely with the reduction in the prices we can see the advantages coming in the freight rates, we can see advantages in the inputs because one of the major input we have is paper where we can see the freight rates easing out.
As far as exports is concerned the way we send books the freight rate should ease out and that will make us more competitive in the market.
Reema: In the previous quarter it wasn’t a great quarter, your revenues were under pressure, your margins declined. Overall for FY15 what is the expectation on revenues and margins?
A: If you are referring to the last quarter or the first half then we have invested a lot in the new initiatives mainly RAPPLES. In the previous year we invested an amount more than Rs 10 crore as well as capex of Rs 5 crore which we have expensed out.
In the current year also a similar kind of investment is happening which we are expensing out. We are not trying to put it as a prepaid expense but we are expensing it out as a result we are seeing an impact on the margins but I would say the margins are at the same levels and they are improving.
As far as 2015 is concerned, we do not give a forward looking statement but the company is doing extremely well. We are one of the largest education solutions providers in the country; we are one of the largest exporters of books.
The third area which is an interesting area is in the EE fulfillment or e–retailing, this an interesting area we are moving into and where we will be able to provide solutions.

Developer: Yes  Capitol Crossing is very tough to getBy Jonathan O'Connell December 11, 2014 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
Jeffrey I. Sussman was facing stiff head winds with his ambitious 2.2 million-square-foot development project, Capitol Crossing .
And that was before the kerfuffle over his proposed closing of Interstate 395.
Sussman and the New York-based company he founded 43 years ago — Property Group Partners — have forged an expertise in developing buildings that quickly attract the prestigious law firms and professional services companies that typically pay some of the highest rents in Washington.
In 2006, the company completed 1101 New York Ave. NW and landed a slew of tenants led by Ernst & Young. Three years later, it completed a glass-skinned building a few blocks from the White House that attracted the law firm Fried Frank and sold earlier this year for a record price of $948 per square foot.
Capitol Crossing is Sussman’s boldest Washington effort to date, one that requires years of engineering and political maneuvering and which is moving headlong into a leasing market that some commercial real estate analysts are calling the worst in decades.

In a deal with the District that Sussman inked in 2010, his company — then named Louis Dreyfus Property Group –  acquired the “air rights” to 6.8 acres above the sunken I-395 entrance. The project offers the District an opportunity to grow its tax base by an estimated $30 million and recover the street grid in the area by connecting F and G streets between Second and Third streets.
Sussman lined up a Fortune 500 insurance company with whom he previously partnered, W.R. Berkley Corp. of Greenwich, Conn., to put up the lion’s share of the development costs, which could be near $1.5 billion. It is the chance to build four new office properties, the likes of which Sussman has been so successful at leasing, at a time when companies — led by tech firms — and their employees are quickly moving into downtown areas.
“That’s where their employees are going to want to be,” Sussman said. “You read about it in San Francisco because those employees don’t want to be in Palo Alto, despite the incentives of buses and shuttles and bikes. They’re going to want to be in the heart of the city.”
The agreement, however, carries tremendous upfront costs before Sussman can collect a dime of rent from the project.
To begin with, a 138-year-old brick building that housed District’s first synagogue was on the development site and could not be torn down. PGP negotiated a deal with the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington to move the 273-ton structure, twice. Once to get it off the development site, which was done by flatbed truck before construction began, and a second time to what will be its permanent home as a museum at Third and F streets.
Then there is the matter of the deck on which the buildings will sit, estimated to cost $200 million. Sussman has been pushing to get the Federal Highway Administration to close more than half a mile of I-395 in order to save as much as 18 months of construction time. To improve its chances, Property Group Partners has spent $330,000 with the public affairs firm Mercury/Clark & Weinstock since 2012, according to Opensecrets.org.
But the suggestion was met with disdain by drivers last week. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D)  indicated he would not request the closure, effectively killing the idea.

Looking at the leasing market downtown, a delayed construction schedule might not be such a bad thing. The white collar firms Sussman is used to courting have been downsizing, pushing the vacancy rate downtown to 11.3 percent. About 823,000 more square feet was vacated than occupied over the past 12 months. Also, one of the few big tenants in the market, Fannie Mae, recently took a pass on Capitol Crossing.
“If you look at the office market, it has been virtually void of net demand the last four years,” said Randolph C. Harrell, an executive vice president at the services firm CBRE. “Just kind of bumping along the bottom, which is not usual. I’ve been in the business 29 years, and this is the longest down market I’ve seen.”
Harrell and Sussman both said buildings with efficient floor layouts are still leasing well. Construction of the deck, Harrell said, would give companies looking to move far more assurance.
“Once they make the investment of $200 million, they’ve played the card at that point and they’ve got to go,” he said.
Sussman said it’s been difficult to lease the project because people have a hard time envisioning three new city blocks where there is currently empty space. “It’s very tough to get it. To see that. And I think once this infrastructure is complete, in seven or eight years people will say, ‘How come we didn’t do that before?’ ”
PGP has been marketing the project for more than a two years from its office on New York Avenue, but recently began pulling out all the stops in search of tenants. Scrapping an old three-dimensional model of the site, PGP purchased a new one that shows the neighborhood around it in intricate detail — down to the tulips along the sidewalk — and a second that interacts with an iPad program to highlight amenities.

Visitors are shown a flashy video that’s nearly three minutes long on a wall of nine flat-screen televisions. Sussman said the idea is to give people a better idea of the location, which he said some have called “funny” or “questionable.”
“I love how people are saying it’s a questionable location. Questionable to what?” he said. “It’s the western end of the downtown area. It’s Capitol Hill. It’s a new area.”
He said he pictured Capitol Crossing as a legacy project for his company, one on par with some of the most ambitious work of his competitors.
“There are a bunch of developers who step out. Boston Properties, Vornado, JBG certainly, Carr, Akridge — they really step out and do big stuff. And I think the tenant community and the broker community tend to lag in interest because they don’t see it. They want to see it before they believe it,” he said.

Ensuring a balanced work-family environment for its employees has made Google the best place to work on Earth, announces the "2015 Best Places to Work" listing from Glassdoor, a US-based website that provides insider ratings and information from employees about the companies they work for.
The micro-blogging site Twitter, which was the second best company last year, has fallen off the grid and is out from the list that ranks top 50 companies to work for in the US and Britain, Glassdoor said in a statement.
Last year, it was the top-rated technology company and the second best company overall.
"It is probably the single biggest change and surprise this year that Twitter did not make the list at all," Robert Hohman, co-founder and CEO of Glassdoor, was quoted as saying in an NBC News report.

At No.2 is Bain & Company, an American global management consulting firm headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and at third spot is Nestle Purina PetCare, a St. Louis, Missouri-based subsidiary of Nestle that produces and markets pet food, treats and litter.
The social networking site Facebook has slipped to 13th position from the fifth last year while business-oriented social networking service LinkedIn has dropped from third position to 23rd spot.
Extra attention to make a balance between work and family responsibilities for its employees has nudged Google to No.1 this year, Glassdoor reported.
During the survey, Google employees cited increased paternity and adoptive parent leave to match that of mothers who give birth.

States oppose GST Bill; compensation, petroleum remain vexed issues

(At a meeting of the Empowered…)
NEW DELHI: In a setback to the Centre, states today rejected the draft Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill saying it does not address their concerns, particularly on entry tax and taxation of petroleum products.
At a meeting of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, the Centre's plan to bring petroleum goods under GST regime was opposed.
They also objected to the the Constitutional Amendment Bill as it does not contain provisions for giving states compensation against any possible loss of revenue after GST roll-out for five years.
"There is no consensus between the Centre and states on these three things (compensation issue, petrol tax and entry tax). The Empowered Committee is not supporting the Bill without these three things," Empowered Committee Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather said after a meeting of the state Finance Ministers.
The central government, he stressed, "will have to respect views of the states."
The states want that the Centre to compensate them for any loss of revenue on implementation of the GST for five years and a clause regarding the compensation be included in the Constitution Amendment Bill, Rather said.
The state governments are also keen on keeping the entry tax and petro tax out of the ambit of the GST.
In a bid to roll out the GST, which would subsume excise and service taxes, the Centre has come out with a new Constitutional Amendment Bill.
"Government hasn't agreed to our recommendations made last time, except one recommendation. We had said that the share of Union government in GST should go to the divisible pool and should be devolved among states , that has been agreed by Centre," Rather said.
Rather said that the draft of the new Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was received by the Committee earlier in the month, did not take on board the suggestions of the state Finance Ministers.
"But we were surprised to know that government hasn't agreed to our recommendations made last time, except one recommendation with regard to putting GST in divisible pool," he added.
However, with regard to petroleum products, entry tax and compensation, he said, "the Government of India has not agreed to our recommendation."
Rather welcomed the decision of the Centre to release Rs 11,000 crore to states as compensation towards the central sales tax (CST) this financial year.
"So far as CST compensation is concerned, we are happy to know that the Centre has agreed to keep a provision of Rs 11,000 crore in the current year's budget...that will settle the claim of CST compensation up to the year 2010-11," he said, adding that the compensation for latter years would be discussed with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
Jaitley announced release of additional funds to the states while replying to a discussion on supplementary demands for grants in the Lok Sabha yesterday.
Clearance of CST compensation arrears has been a bone of contention between Centre and states.
  CST, a tax imposed on the inter-state movement of goods, was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in 2007-08 and further to 2 per cent in 2008-09 after the introduction of Value-Added Tax (VAT). The Centre had then promised the states that it would bear losses due to reduction of CST.
As part of the roll-out of GST, the CST is being phased out and has been reduced to two per cent from the earlier four per cent. The Centre collects CST and distributes it among states.
The GST roll-out has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the proposed new tax regime.

Rupee plunges 31 paise to 10-month low against US dollarForex update: Rupee plunges 31 paise to 10-month low of 62.33 against dollar

The rupee on Thursday plunged 31 paise to a ten-month low of 62.33 versus the Greenback on strong demand for the US dollar due to oil firms stepping up purchases of crude oil trading near 5-year lows and a weak trend in shares.
Concerns related to capital outflows and a strong dollar in overseas markets against other currencies like the Japanese Yen too weighed on the rupee, a forex dealer said.
Logging its fourth consecutive session of decline, the domestic unit has now shed 56 paise against the US dollar.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the rupee resumed lower at 62.15 a dollar from its Wednesday's close of 62.02 and immediately the intra-day high of 62.12.
However, weakness in the domestic equity market throughout the day put pressure on the domestic currency.
The rupee gradually declined to a low of 62.3575 before ending at 62.33, logging a fall of 31 paise.
This is the currency's weakest close since February, 2014.
In terms of single-session fall, Thursday's 31-paise slide is its biggest drop against the US dollar since October 16, when it had slumped by 42 paise.
The American unit got a lift against the rupee as unwinding of the Yen and Euro carry trades triggered a sell-off in local equities.
"The sell-off global equity market has spilled over into Indian shores as well. As a result, we have seen buying of US Dollars... Over the past two sessions. There was demand noted from a few PSUs," said Anindya Banerjee, Currency Analyst, Kotak Securities.
Meanwhile, the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex on Thursday , after taking a respite for a day, tumbled by 229.09 points (or 0.82 per cent).
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out US $6.92 million on Wednesday, as per data released by market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
The dollar index was up by 0.06 per cent against its six major global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said, "Indian Rupee depreciated by half per cent, taking cues from dollar index which is trading multi-year highs. Also, the dollar demand from oil companies dented the rupee movement further. There is caution ahead of consumer price inflation data due tomorrow (Friday)."
The trading range for the spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 62.00 to 62.70, Brahmbhatt added.

Palestinians  Israeli border police clash in West Bank over Cabinet ministers deathBy: Press Trust of India | Ramallah/jerusalem |
Posted: December 11, 2014 6:09 pm
Tensions escalated in West Bank and east Jerusalem on Thursday as clashes erupted between the Palestinians and Israeli border police over conflicting reports on the death of a Palestinian Cabinet minister.
Ziad Abu Ein died following a scuffle with the Israeli troops during a protest demonstration on Wednesday near Adei Ad, an Israeli outpost in the West Bank.
In a statement, the Palestinian Authority (PA) blamed Israel for his “murder”.
Though the Israeli pathologist who participated in the autopsy claimed that the team, which included a Palestinian and a Jordanian pathologist, concluded that Abu Ein died of stress-induced heart attack.
“The autopsy results of Palestinian minister Ziad Abu Ein show that he died after a powerful blow to the diaphragm and the heavy use of tear gas”, Hussein al-Sheikh, Palestinian minister of civil affairs, said.
“The reason for the death of Abu Ein was his being hit by (Israeli) occupation troops…,” he said.
“We will refer the autopsy results to the Palestinian leadership to take the decisions they want,” al-Sheikh said adding that “if Israel admits to the murder of Abu Ein, there will be no need to go to the International Criminal Court.”
Sabir al-Aloul, director of forensic medicine in the Palestinian Ministry of Health, told Ma’an news agency that a strike to Abu Ein’s face dislodged his front teeth and forced them to the back of his throat, near the epiglottis.
“After hearing the results of the post-mortem, the Palestinian government holds Israel fully responsible for the killing of Ziad Abu Ein,” PA spokesman Ihab Bseiso said.
However, Israel’s Health Ministry’s version of the cause of the death says that the three pathologists concluded that the death was caused by blockage in the coronary artery, and that there were signs of light internal bleeding and localised pressure on the neck.
The deceased suffered from heart disease, and there was evidence that plaque buildup were clogging more than 80 per cent of his blood vessels, as well as signs that he had suffered heart attacks in the past, Israeli media reported.
Abu Ein’s died during a demonstration by 300 Palestinians who wanted to plant Olive trees as a symbolic act of protest against Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

Indian soldiers in First World War were hired assassins of British: Justice MarkandeyKatjuWritten by Man Aman Singh Chhina | Chandigarh |
Posted: December 11, 2014 6:00 pm
Justice Markandey Katju has once again courted controversy in his blog and this time the objects of his caustic remarks are soldiers of the Indian Army who took part in the First World War under the British flag. Questioning the need to honour these soldiers in the 100th anniversary of the war, Justice Katju has said that the Indian troops fought as “hired assassins”.
In the blog, written on December 9, Justice Katju says that he differs with the view that Indian soldiers who fought in World War 1 should be honoured. He then goes on to give a history of the First World War and the reason why the Triple alliance of England, France and Russia fought against Germany and Austria.
While giving this background Justice Katju argues that the First World War had nothing to do with the people of India. It was a war which was fought for redistribution of colonies.
He further writes that the Indian soldiers who fought in that war on the side of the British and French “were really mercenaries and hirelings of the British and French”. He also writes that “the Indian troops fought as hired assassins” to kill Germans for Anglo-French interests, not Indian interests. “They may have been brave, but many hired assassins are also brave. Why then should we honour them,” he questions.
Not surprisingly his comments have riled many in the Indian defence community and among the first to criticise Justice Katju is Captain Amarinder Singh of the erstwhile royal state of Patiala. Patiala state contributed one of the largest contingents of soldiers to the British effort in the first world war and he has also recently written a book on the role of Indian soldiers in the First World War.
Attacking Justice Katju, Capt Amarinder said that he should not make comments on issues about which he has no knowledge. “What he has written in his blog is an insult to to the Indian Army and its regiments. The Indian Army deserves an apology from Justice Katju,” he said.
Amarinder went on to add that the decision to send Indian troops to fight in the First World War was ratified by the Indian National Congress which passed a resolution ratifying it. “Even Mahatma Gandhi supported this then who is Katju to question the motivation and dedication of the Indian soldier who fought for his regiment and honour,” he said.
As many as 62,000 Indian troops are officially listed as having died in the four-year long war. However, as per Captain Amarinder the number of those who lost their lives is far more since this list does not include those from the state forces. “The Commonwealth Graves Commission lists 74,000 Indian,” he continued…

Changing China trends focus in Guwahati LiteraryFestivalWritten by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati |
Posted: December 11, 2014 5:53 pm
Changing social and cultural trends in China with focus on writing will be one important focus area in the upcoming third Guwahati Literary Festival that will be held here in the last week of December.
Disclosing this here on Thursday, Assam Education Minister Pradyut Bordoloi said while the Northeast shares about 1280 kms of boundary with China, very little is discussed in the region about socio-cultural changes that are taking place in the neighbouring country. “It is very important for people to know what is happening in the neighbourhood, and writers can play a major role in disseminating information about them,” the minister said.
“The Guwahati Literary Festival is one opportunity where participants will listen to two eminent China scholars Prof Pushpesh Pant and Alka Acharya will be discussing about China. Rajen Saikia, former president of the Indian History Association will also take part in the discussion,” Bordoloi, who is also chairman of Assam Publication Board, which organizes the Festival, said.
China incidentally has figured prominently in several Assamese works of fiction, the first being Jnanpith award-winning author Birendra Kumar Bhattacharyya’s “Shataghni” written in the backdrop of the Chinese aggression of 1962. Five decades later Sahitya Akademi award winner Rita Choudhury came out with “Makam”, a novel that highlighted the plight of people of Chinese origin in the wake of the 1962 war with China.
The Guwahati Literary Festival, which will be held from December 27 to 29, will also have a session on reflection of the Second World War in literature in Assam, Nagaland and Manipur. The Northeast had become an important scene of the World War after the Allied Forces had retreated following intense Japanese attack in Burma (present-day Myanmar).
“People of the Northeastern region were witness to a crucial phase of the World War, especially with the Battle of Kohima now regarded as a turning point in world history. The War has figured prominently in Assamese and Manipuri literature, while writers like Easterine Kire of Nagaland and Siddhartha Sharma of Assam have written wonderful fiction in English woven around the Battle of Kohima,” minister Bordoloi said.
A galaxy of eminent writers like Mark Tully, Namita Gokhale, Jerry Pinto, Urvashi Butalia, Mitra Phukan, Arup Kumar Dutta, Sanjoy Hazarika, Robin Ngangom, Aruni Kashyap, Monalisa Changkija, Preeti Gill, CP Surendran, Janice Pariat, Dhrubajyoti Bora and Arnab Goswami are taking part in various sessions spread over the three days.

 Sensex Falls 229 Points as Energy Stocks SlideL&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
The BSE Sensex fell 229 points or 0.82 per cent on Thursday, while the broader Nifty ended below the key 8,300 mark for the first time since October 30. The rupee also came under sharp selling pressure and closed near a 10-month low at 62.33 per dollar. (Read: Why rupee is down )
December has been a weak month for domestic equities so far. The Sensex is now down over 1,200 points in just nine sessions, while the Nifty has fallen around 300 points.
The latest bout of weakness in domestic equities and rupee has come on the back of a sharp slowdown in buying by foreign funds, which have been the major force behind the superlative returns this year. Profit booking by foreign investors is par for the course towards the end of a calendar year, analysts say.
Weak global cues have also dampened sentiments in domestic shares. Global markets have come under sharp selloff because of a slide in energy shares and on concerns about economic growth.
India is a big beneficiary of the slump in crude prices, which hit a new five-year low below $65 per barrel on Wednesday. However, the fall in oil prices is bad news for upstream oil companies such as state-run ONGC and Cairn India and for refiners such as Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries because lower oil prices translate into lower margins.
ONGC fell 3.2 per cent, while index heavyweight RIL declined 2.8 per cent. Gail India ended 2.4 per cent lower and Cairn India fell 2.33 per cent.
High beta realty stocks also came under selling pressure today. IT stocks also continued their slide, falling 1.2 per cent. Infosys closed down 2.2 per cent, its 10th straight session of fall.
Gainers included drugmakers such as Dr Reddy's and Lupin, which are seen as defensive bets. IDFC, Tech Mahindra and Coal India were the top three gainers today.
The Sensex ended at 27,602, while the Nifty declined 63 points to close at 8,292.90.

Can divest good assets ASAP: Sun Pharma on CCI order04:00 pm
The competition watchdog has recently cleared the USD 4 billion deal between  Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy with riders. Specifically, Competition Commission of India (CCI) has asked both companies to sell seven brands from the combined entity's portfolio within 6 months for the deal to go through. Speaking to CNBC-TV18’s Archana Shukla, Sun Pharma chairman Israel Makov said the company has started working on the order.
“First of all I have to tell you that we have started the day after the CCI order – this is number one. Second, we are divesting good assets, we are not divesting bad assets and you have a lot of buyers for good assets. We will have no problem of this divestment and we will do it as fast as we can,” he said.
Below is the transcript of Israel Makov’s interview:
Q: With the CCI’s nod already in place FTC dialogues progress, what sort of a timeline have you set for yourself or the two companies to close this deal?
A: We have set a time at the beginning which will be by the end of this year but the delay is not by us; it is not that we aren’t able to close. We were ready to close six months ago but we are waiting just for the approval and within the next few weeks, the next very few months we will get it.
Q: Two of the best minds in the generic pharmaceutical space Mr Sanghvi and Mr Makov and two of the best minds in the merger and acquisition (M&A) space coming together in Sun Pharma. What sort of plans you have for Sun Pharma from hereon. You have helped them get on to the big platform becoming number five in the generic space on the international platform. How are you charting the progress from here?
A: The only thing which I want to tell you that we will aim to continue to grow at a fast rate as we did in the past. Merger and acquisition is a tool; M&A is not an objective. First of all we have to merge Ranbaxy and afterwards if we find an interesting opportunity which will fit our strategy, which will fit our objectives, we will do it.

Louisa Hellegers spent more than 40 years in publishing before deciding  to retire from the field in 2009. But at just over 60, she wasn't  ready to transition into a leisurely retirement.
"I didn't think I was done working. I really had no idea what I was going to  do, but I didn't think that I was done," Hellegers said.
Jim Seida / msnbc.com
After successful careers, many older Americans are looking for meaningful work, not just financial gain.
She realized that the skills she had as a publishing executive were  transferable and that gave her confidence as she searched for a second act, or  encore career. She applied for a fellowship that eventually placed her at a  nonprofit agency that helps find jobs for men and women who were formerly  incarcerated.
More Americans are working into their retirement like Hellegers.  Nearly 20 percent of those age 65 and older are still working in some capacity,  according to AARP, double the number in 1985. But after successful careers, many  older Americans are looking for meaningful work, not just financial  gain.
"If it becomes something more of a passion where you feel like you can stay  in it for the longer haul, that financially may make sense," said Jean Setzfand,  financial security expert at AARP.

When we first met Hellegers in the summer of 2013, she was working as  director of organizational development for the Center for Employment  Opportunities in New York on the fellowship from the nonprofit organization  Encore.org.

Earlier this year, Hellegers, now 66, became the New York program director of  Encore.org, helping to spearhead efforts to ensure older workers have the  opportunity to pursue careers that have a social impact.
"Employers and society and communities are understanding the value that  experienced professionals can bring across all kinds of business," Hellegers  said. After all, their experience often spans many decades, bringing coveted  skills that are attractive to many different industries.
AARP looked at industries that are friendly to older, experienced workers,  and found academia, hospitals and healthcare often top the list. But those  certainly aren't the only industries attracting older workers.
"One of the things that we've found is that it is very much a business-driven  decision in terms of why companies really value experienced workers," Setzfand  says. The critical attribute is "experience."

IIT-Bombay girl bags Rs 2 cr package from FacebookIIT-Bombay girl bags Rs 2 crore package from Facebook
PTI     Jaipur   Last Updated: December 9, 2014  | 00:00 IST

An IIT-Bombay student has claimed to have received a job offer of Rs two crore from the social networking site Facebook.
Aastha Agrawal (20), a fourth-year student of Computer Science at IIT-B, had completed her third-year internship in the companys headquarters in California in May-June this year following which the company gave her the pre-placement offer.
"I am very happy and excited with the offer and will join in the Headquarters after completing my 8th semester", Aastha, who is home in Jaipur for winter vacations, said.
She said the company was satisfied with her work during the internship and offered her the job soon after and added that she will be joining the job in October next year.
Her father, Ashok Agrawal, is executive engineer at Rajasthan Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (RVPNL) here whereas her elder sister is a chemical engineer.
Aastha had secured seventh-rank in state in National Talent Search Examination (NTSE)in school and also won silver medal in International Junior Science Olympiad.
She had also been selected to represent India at the Junior Science International Olympiad in 2009.

Glenn Beck Calls  SNL  The  Biggest Group Of P-ssies On The Planetreddit
Well, it looks like Glenn Beck won't be guest hosting "Saturday Night Live" anytime soon.
During a sprawling rant about Sunday's " blasphemous " "Family Guy" episode in which Peter Griffin attempts to help Jesus lose his virginity , Glenn Beck paused momentarily to attack "SNL" for not having the courage to adequately mock the nation's true authority figures.
"'Saturday Night Live' is the biggest group of pussies on the planet and here's why," Beck said while appearing remotely from New York on the Blaze TV Tuesday morning. "They get up and they have somebody play the president -- he doesn't even try. He doesn't even try to make himself look like the president, he doesn't even go for the accent. They don't do anything like it."
"That's a wuss! You're a coward!" Beck continued, later stating that the Christian church is not as all-powerful as people think. "If you can't say it to power, you have no bravery."
Beck was the subject of some gentle "SNL" spoofing himself back in 2009, so perhaps he's speaking from experience.

After Delhi rape row  former Uber driver in US charged with manslaughterTata Motors sales up 10 pct in December
After the rape of 27-year-old MNC Executive in New Delhi by Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, the company has again landed into trouble. A former driver with the company has been charged with manslaughter in the death of a six-year-old girl when he rammed his car into the family as it was crossing a street last year.
Syed Muzzafar, who was working for Uber in San Francisco, hit Huan Kuang, her 4-year-old son Anthony Liu and six-year- old daughter Sophia Liu as they were crossing the street on December 31 last year.
Muzzafar collided his Uber car in the family, seriously injuring Kuang and her son.
The young girl succumbed to her injuries.
Kuang had filed a lawsuit against Uber and Muzzafar in January this year in which she had said that Uber breached its duty of applying “reasonable care” in “hiring, training and supervision” of its drivers.
She had said in the complaint that Muzzafar was “unfit” to be a “provider of transportation and was not “adequately trained or supervised” in his driving.
Muzzafar was charged yesterday in a California court with misdemeanour vehicular manslaughter, which carries penalties of up to one year of jail time.
The case that the family filed against Uber still remains unresolved.
A report in Time magazine said that according to court documents, Muzzafar was in between UberX fares when the accident happened.
Meanwhile, a report in the Huffington Post said that Chicago police is also investigating an allegation that an Uber driver had raped a female customer.
Chicago police said they have been in contact with the woman as well as Uber personnel, but declined to give further details.
The charges against the former Uber driver come at a time when the company is facing severe backlash in India and other cities across the world over concerns about safety and drivers’ negligence.
In New Delhi, the company has been banned after a woman executive accused an Uber driver of raping her.
In growing legal trouble for Uber, the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles have filed a lawsuit against the company for making false and misleading statements to consumers, including about the quality of background checks it performs on drivers.
San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon and Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey filed a civil complaint against Uber alleging that the company engaged in a variety of unlawful business practices in violation of California business laws.
The suit seeks a permanent injunction requiring Uber to stop violating California law.
It also seeks civil penalties for each of the unlawful business acts and practices, as well as full restitution for all California consumers who paid the airport toll.
Uber has been facing increasing backlash in cities across the world because of its operations and drivers.

14 changes to social media marketers need to know14 changes to social media marketers need to know
Social media
Updates to social media you should know about.

There's always something new to learn, study or experiment with in social media.
To paraphrase  Ferris Bueller , social media moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.
That’s why from time to time we like to offer an overview of all the recent changes to some of the major networks in social media. There’s always something new to learn, study or experiment with in social media, and even the biggest social media networks aren’t exempt from this rule.
Here are 14 of some of the most recent changes to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google+ and Instagram that social media marketers can benefit from:
FACEBOOK UPDATES
8
Facebook’s most recent update (as of only this week!) is making it easier to find posts you want to get back to. According to the social media network, a way to  search past posts through Facebook Graph Search  has been a much requested feature.
“You’ve given us a lot of feedback on the Graph Search beta. You’ve told us the most important thing is being able to find posts you’ve seen before, and now you can. With a quick search, you can get back to a fun video from your graduation, a news article you’ve been meaning to read, or photos from your friend’s wedding last summer.”
This update is rolling out this week in US English on iPhone and desktop. I haven’t been able to see it in action just yet; let me know if you have!
2. Saved posts

Nowadays, the need of social media got increased among most people around the world. That's why most marketing professionals and business concerns are utilizing social for promoting businesses and gathering audiences around the world. So, when going for the business promotion on a social...

Ever come across something great you want to read on Facebook when you don’t quite have the time to devote to it right then? Facebook must have noticed lots of us with this challenge, so they created a great solution: Saved posts!
When you spot an intriguing post or event, you can click the drop-down menu to quickly save it for later.
When you’re ready to browse your saved posts, you can find them in the menu on the left side under your profile.
This will take you to all your saved stories, where you can read and archive them at your leisure. Quick privacy note: Only you can see the things you save on Facebook to view later.
3. Rooms for every interest
One of Facebook’s most fascinating recent additions is Rooms — an anonymous chatroom type app that hearkens back to the early days on the web.
Here’s how Facebook describes Rooms in the debut announcement:
“Rooms lets you create places for the things you’re into, and invite others who are into them too. A room is a feed of photos, videos, and text — not too different from the one you have on Instagram or Facebook —with a topic determined by whoever created the room.”
When you join, some Rooms will be recommended to you, but there is no way to search for Rooms. That’s on purpose, Facebook Product Manager Josh Miller told Mashable.
“Though counterintuitive, our logic was that retro web browsers didn’t offer ‘discovery’ for early Internet communities — you had to tell Netscape exactly where you wanted to go — so why should we?” he said. “Our hypothesis was that places on the web being hard to find was a feature, not a bug.”
You get into a Room by snapping a photo of the Room’s QR code.
Then you can browse photos and contribute on your topics of interest.
I have to admit that Facebook Rooms are still a bit mysterious to me. I’d love to hear about your experiences with them!
4. Facebook Groups app
Facebook Groups are a great way to stay in touch with specific groups of people with shared interests, and now you can have that experience on mobile as well as the Facebook desktop with the new Facebook Groups app.
You can post updates, links and photos to your groups, start new discussions and find new groups to join, or even start a new group right through the app.
When you open the app, you’ll see all your Facebook Groups in one place. Groups you use most frequently are at the top, and you can quickly move between each group.
5. “Buy” button
Have you spotted this one in the wild yet? I haven’t seen it myself, but Facebook has started testing a new feature that allows users on desktop or mobile to click a “Buy” button on ads and Page posts and purchase a product without leaving Facebook.
This change, if rolled out widely, could be a major boon to help businesses drive sales through Facebook in News Feed and on Pages.
TWITTER UPDATES
6. Archive search
This is a big one: With Twitter’s  new full tweet index , you can now search through every public tweet since the social network’s launch in 2006. For instance, here’s Buffer’s very first tweet!
To help you navigate this new bounty, Twitter has added some enhanced options into its Advanced Search, including handy date range functionality to help you pinpoint what you’re looking for.
Originally, Twitter was designed to focus on just the present moment, so the service removed every tweet from its search index after a week or so.
“Our search engine excelled at surfacing breaking news and events in real time, and our search index infrastructure reflected this strong emphasis on recency.”
But as the service has evolved, Twitter has been working on improving its search function with a goal to “to let people search through every Tweet ever published.”
Now that that moment has arrived, it’s fun to look back and see how we’ve all evolved our Twitter style. It could also be worth a quick spin through your old tweets just to be sure there aren’t any surprises lurking there!
7. Share tweets through direct messages
In a change that could be handy for social media managers and community managers on the go, Twitter has also recently added the ability to share tweets through direct messaging.
The person you share with will get a push notification, and the tweet will display directly in the conversation.
This offers up a quick and efficient new channel for remote teams to share information about what’s being said in their Twitter community.
8. New tweets in your timeline
You may have heard some of the murmurings that  Twitter is likely working on an algorithm  to help sort through the massive amount of content that gets posted there every day.
We can see what might be the beginnings of such a change in a move that Twitter made recently to  show some tweets from accounts you don’t follow in your timeline .
Here’s  how Twitter describes  how you’ll observe this change your Twitter timeline today:

Bank Analyst Actually Uses  I Can t Breathe  As Title Of Research NoteEmail
Comment
There are appropriate occasions to knowingly use the now-loaded phrase "I can't breathe," and there are less-appropriate occasions.
An appropriate occasion: during a march to protest the failure to indict the Staten Island policeman responsible for the death of Eric Garner , whose last words, repeated again and again as he died, were "I can't breathe."
A not-so-appropriate occasion: When you are trying to drum up outrage about how regulators are treating a law-breaking bank.
A London bank analyst for the British-South African bank Investec chose the latter approach on Wednesday morning, publishing a research note about the British bank Standard Chartered with the title "I Can't Breathe." (Here's a picture of the top of the note, courtesy of a Wall Street Journal tweet .)
Investec releases StanChart note with headline: 'I Can't Breathe' http://t.co/wgqZK2t1L9 pic.twitter.com/KoGhjrtQas
— WSJ Europe (@WSJeurope) December 10, 2014
Investec apologized for the note, in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post:
“Investec apologises unreservedly for the inappropriate content in this morning's research note on Standard Chartered and for any offence caused. The content in question does not represent the views of Investec.”
Investec analyst Ian Gordon wrote that U.S. regulators are stifling StanChart as punishment for breaking U.S. laws against doing business with rogue regimes such as Iran. The bank has already been put on a sort of probation by the U.S. Department of Justice, called a "deferred prosecution agreement," over that issue. On Tuesday the bank agreed to extend that probation by another three years, inspiring Gordon's note.
The note doesn't mention Garner specifically, but the headline of his note appears to imply that Standard Chartered's treatment is pretty much just like an unarmed man being choked to death during an arrest.
Gordon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but he did talk extensively to the Financial Times, which first reported his note. Gordon explained to the paper that, yes, he sure did mean to draw the comparison between Garner and StanChart.
"They are both examples of abuse of power or authoritarian control gone wrong,” Gordon told the FT. “Standard Chartered — a legitimate business — is being prevented from breathing or operating by U.S. regulatory discriminatory behaviour. The parallel I see is unfettered power by a U.S. agency.”
Gordon expressed surprise that StanChart's treatment wasn't arousing the same sort of anger as Garner's tragic and pointless death.
“The parallel, or lack of parallel, is that in the Garner case you see widespread anger and uprising in the public,” Gordon told the FT. “In the case of StanChart — and yes, it is very different circumstances — but the silence of the UK government is perverse given the circumstances. StanChart itself is gagged.”
We'll give you a second to pick your jaw up off the floor.
Gordon wanted to make this point more explicitly in his note, but some unnamed hero in Investec's compliance department thought better of that and removed the offending bits, though leaving the headline on the note for all to see.
Gordon apparently doesn't think StanChart is all that stifled -- he gave its stock a "buy" rating.
Standard Chartered did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
This post has been updated with a comment from Investec.

Chicago scrap metal dealer to plead guilty to tax charges  authorities say0
Tri State paid about 15 scrap metal vendors more than $6.17 million in cash over a four-year period beginning in September 2008, according to the complaint. Tri State also accepted checks made to fictitious people totaling more than $2.92 million. The company would cash those checks and use the money to pay employee wages totaling $1.47 million, according to the complaint.
The tax charge carries a maximum penalty of five years' probation and a $500,000 fine.
Authorities said Tri State could forfeit $1.9 million seized from a company bank account and $118,420 in cash taken from its offices at 1745 W. Fulton St.
None of the individuals involved were charged. The former owner and president of Tri State, who also benefited from the scheme, is deceased, the U.S. attorney's office said.

Illinois Supreme Court grants sped-up pension law appeal22
The pension overhaul was aimed at reining in the state retirement system's $100 billion-plus shortfall, but a lower court ruled the legislation violated a provision in the state constitution that declares retirement benefits cannot be "diminished or impaired."
Lawyers for several union groups that challenged the pension law had argued against a speedier schedule, saying it would make it more difficult to fight the appeal. They also said a quicker hearing was not needed because it was impossible for a final resolution to come before May 31 — the deadline for lawmakers to put in place a new budget.
Lawmakers are hoping a ruling by the state Supreme Court will provide guidance on how to move forward in proposing new changes, though they may end up out of luck since justices aren't required to offer an alternative plan of action.
Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn and lawmakers approved the pension measure a little more than a year ago. It called for scaling back cost-of-living adjustments and required government employees to work longer before retirement in exchange for paying a little less toward their pensions. The idea was to cut the overall costs of paying down the pension debt and put the state on a 30-year road toward eliminating a massive hole created by decades of underfunding.

Bharatpurs pride  painted storks  go missing  officials cant say whySituated in Block D of the bird sanctuary, the painted storks’ colony has been in existence for at least 200 years.
New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 4:55 am
The world famous Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary in Rajasthan has lost its biggest draw — the painted stork. The hugely popular and colourful birds, whose colony inside the sanctuary is touted as one of the largest in Asia, flew away last month. Environmentalists and bird watchers have called it a huge tragedy, since the entire flock of 1,500-plus painted storks abandoned the colony in the middle of their breeding season — leaving behind hundreds of eggs which were later devoured by crows and other carrion birds.
The forest department of Bharatpur, though aware of the stinging loss to the world heritage site, is treading cautiously. “I came here only last month, so can’t really comment. But if you insist, I will get a report from my staff,’’ said Field Director Bijo Joy.
The Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests & Chief Wildlife Warden of Rajasthan, Sidhnath Singh, said he was informed about the mass departure, but the officials at Bharatpur could do precious little in the matter. Blaming the “insufficient monsoon’’, he emphasised that shortage of water seemed to be the only culprit. “Nobody can control the monsoon. 2014 was particularly bad, so the storks probably decided not to stay,’’ he said.
Singh may be technically correct, but there is another reason. By several accounts, the painted storks started leaving last month after the forest department allowed dozens of trucks and JCB machines inside the sanctuary. These were engaged to build mud platforms around the storks’ colony, so as to enable the visitors to click “better photographs’’ of the birds.
Also, mounds were created in the water bodies — ostensibly to give more perching space to the storks. But all this had an opposite effect: in Bharatpur, where the only modes of transport allowed are bicycles and cycle rickshaws, the onslaught of heavy machinery scared the storks, prompting them to take flight en masse.
Joy’s predecessor Khyati Mathur, who was the Field Director at the time the painted storks flew away, claimed that construction activities in and around the colony did not trigger their departure. “I am sure the birds have evolved to a degree that they accept a fairly high level of human activities. Aren’t the birds thriving at Okhla barrage, despite the commotion from nearby Delhi and Noida?’’ she replied to a query.
But bird conservation experts contested Mathur’s argument. “You do not construct mounds near trees where birds have already made their nest. They will definitely fly away,’’ said Dr K Sivakumar, senior scientist with Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) whose team members have been doing research in Bharatpur for the last 15 years.
Sivakumar said there was no possibility of the painted storks coming continued…

Jolie and Sandler Bear Brunt of Latest Sony Email LeakJolie and Sandler Bear Brunt of Latest Sony Email Leak
 
Dec 10, 2014 8:48pm
Entertainment and electronics company Sony has apparently suffered yet another leak of internal emails.
Emails reportedly hacked and leaked claimed to show a top producer criticizing Angelina Jolie’s talent and ego; employees bashing Adam Sandler’s movies; and a talent manager flattering Leonardo DiCaprio in an apparent attempt to try to woo him into playing a part in a major motion picture.
Could Seth Rogen and James Franco’s New Film Atart a War?
In a statement to ABC News today, Sony said it had an “enormously successful partnership” with Sandler and intended to be in business with him “forever.”
Sony also said, “We don’t know where those comments came from or who said them. We have Pixels, Hotel T, the Grown Ups franchise, Paul Blart and several TV series on the air. We are in no way backing off of our relationship with Adam Sandler, which is both creatively fertile and quite profitable for the studio.”

The leak comes after hackers leaked copies of films like “Annie” and Brad Pitt’s “Fury” in November.
“It’s truly a digital-era disaster,” said Brent Lang, a senior film and media reporter at Variety. “And it’s one that shows no signs of stopping.”
The FBI is still investigating who is behind the cyberwar and whether it could be North Korea’s retaliation for the upcoming Sony movie “ The Interview ” and its plot to assassinate Kim Jong Un.
Hackers calling themselves the Guardians of Peace also reportedly accessed directors and actors’ phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers and even aliases they’ve used to protect their privacy.
So far, Sony has been losing millions from pirated copies of the movies.
“Sony definitely can bounce back from this,” Lang said. “It’s going to take time. It’s not just going to take months. It may take years.”
“The Interview” is still slated to premiere in Los Angeles Thursday.

Khap panchayats are illegal and unconstitutionalIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
Government today termed all ‘customary courts’ like Khap panchayats as illegal and unconstitutional and asked state governments to check such set up as it was a serious issue.
Law Minister D V Sadananda Gowda told Lok Sabha that all ‘customary courts’, Khap panchayats and kangaroo courts are “against the law and against the Constitution”.
“It is a very serious issue. State governments have to take action and check such customary courts,” he said during Question Hour.
Gowda was replying a supplementary Rabindra Kumar Jena (BJD) who raised the issue of such a court in West Bengal.
The Minister said he would soon write to all states for setting up of ‘Naari Aadalat’ (women courts) for expeditious disposals of cases related to women.
Gowda said the Central government was ready to provide assistance to state governments for setting up of free legal aid cell to help poor and weaker sections of the society.
He said government was committed to providing free legal services to the poor and weaker sections of the society such as members of SC, ST, women and children.
Under the Legal Services Authorities Act 1987, persons belonging to SC, ST, a victim of trafficking, a woman, a child, a person with disability, an industrial workman are entitled to free legal services irrespective of their economic or social status, he said.

India playing a proactive role in climate discussions'India playing a proactive role in climate discussions'

Lima: Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Independent Charge), Prakash Javadekar meeting the Vice Chairman, NDRC, China, Xie Zhenhua, at UN Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru on Monday. (PTI Photo)
Union Environment and Forests Minister Prakash Javadekar stressed on India's commitment to protecting the interests of the poor at the international climate community meeting in Lima this week.
The meeting in Peru will discuss draft text of an agreement to be signed in Paris next year and countries are expected to come up with their Intended Nationally Determined Commitments by June 2015.
Bhaskar Deol, India Representative based in Delhi with the Natural Resources Defense Council says that the past few weeks we have seen the new government taking a proactive role in international climate discussions. "Environment minister Prakash Javadekar played a positive role in the Montreal Protocol discussions that concluded in Paris earlier in November and now he is playing that role in Lima."
At Lima too, India's interventions are keeping in line with the spirit of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and larger interest of developing countries. Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, The Council on Energy, Environment and Water says that India has so far stuck to its previous stand of focusing on differentiation between Annex I and Non-Annex I countries through the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR), urging the developed nations to increase the ambition of their mitigation commitments and ensuring that adequate support in the form of finance and technology are available to the developing countries.
Manish Kumar Shrivastava, Fellow, The Energy and Resources Institute, New Delhi says that demanding higher level of ambition from developed countries on account of historical responsibility and capability has been the hall mark of India's position in climate change. For the draft negotiating text, India has very strongly opposed three major components.
The first being the proposal of ex ante review of intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) which amount to allowing the international community to determine national contributions, as this is against the principle of sovereignty.
Second is the developed country proposal to almost exclusively limit INDCs to quantifiable mitigation actions. Shrivastava says India has argued that climate response needs multiple types of actions.
Hence, besides mitigation, adaptation, technology transfer, finance and capacity building are also important contributions. This understanding is consistent with the UNFCCC provisions and various Conference of the Parties (COP) decisions. It encourages developing countries to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies and forces developed countries to also come forward with, in addition to their mitigation commitments, measurable pledges on technology transfer and finance.
India has strongly proposed the need for targeted joint technology research and development initiatives. Third is the proposal demanding local and city governments in developing countries to report on their actions. So far, local and city governments across countries have developed a voluntary cooperation on climate action while staying within the nationally determined climate policy. This proposal implies that local and city governments can act independently of national strategy, which amounts to interference with national governance and polity structure.
Experts say that while India continues to champion the case of the developing world, the Indian negotiation team should contribute constructively to ensure the creation of a robust framework for the crucial talks in Paris next year.
Ghosh says that as a way forward, India should build new coalitions of partners focusing on issues of direct concern to its development priorities. These would include partnerships on global initiatives on energy access, energy efficiency, energy storage, and low-carbon rural development.
The world is certainly watching India more closely to see how India responds as the US, China and Europe have made their initial announcements on the climate targets known, says head of Climate and Energy Greenpeace India Vinuta Gopal.
"Since India is the third largest emitter, even if that is a distant third, our position at Lima will be an indication of how much political momentum can be created to move the world towards a planet saving and fair deal."
She adds that India will have to address the white elephant in the room - what it will do with its coal plans.
"It is in our strategic interests to both act and be seen to be taking climate change seriously. India is now claiming its place on the world stage, and the climate negotiations are a platform for India to display statesmanship and not merely stick to its old rhetoric of common but differentiated responsibility."

With the government indicating that it won't continue to fund public sector banks (PSBs),  SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya today said they could look at issuing shares with differential voting rights to raise funds to meet the Basel-III capital adequacy norms.
"The writing on the wall is very clear...they (PSBs) have to think of differential voting rights. It is time to lay out some kind of road map on how much the banks need to do and how much support it would get," she said while talking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference.
The government yesterday allowed PSBs to raise up to Rs 1.60 lakh crore from markets by diluting government holding to 52 percent in phases so as to meet Basel III norms. Pitching for consolidation in the banking sector, Bhattacharya said that it was important to have three-four major banks.
"It is extremely important for India to have 3-4 major banks. ... We should allow the banks to come together and talk among themselves. In the past also we have seen government has forced some mergers...it is very important for the banks to determine who should be their correct partners," she added.
According to Bhattacharya, "it is better to merge good banks with good banks."
She further said the government has shown its intent to continue with reforms in the banking sector by deciding to bring down its stake to 52 percent. "The news that the government has allowed PSBs to bring down government stake to 52 percent kicks off the next round of reforms... because for the first time clear signal has been given (to PSBs) to source capital from the market.
"The big daddy back there is not going to be around to give them capital as and when they need. If they need to be competitive and want to grow, then they definitely need to look at other places for more capital," Bhattacharya added.
Out of 27 PSBs, Government of India controls 22 through majority holding. In the remaining 5 banks, state-run SBI holds majority stake. The Basel III norms, which will come into effect from March 31, 2019, were put in place following the 2007-08 financial crisis triggered by the fall of Lehman Brothers.
The norms are aimed at improving risk management and governance while raising the banking sector's ability to absorb financial and economic stress. As per Basel-III norms, the minimum capital level for Tier-1 has to be 7 percent.

NEW DELHI: Jet Airways today announced cancellation of two flights to Newark via Brussels and re-routed two others to Toronto through Paris on December 15 due to a general strike called by all major trade unions in Belgium.
"The planned nationwide strike in Belgium on Monday, December 15 will directly affect flight operations in and out of Brussels airport (BRU)," a Jet statement said.
The airline cancelled flight 9W-228 on the Mumbai- Brussels-Newark sector and 9W-227 on Newark-Brussels route on December 14 and Brussels-Mumbai on December 15.
Delhi to Toronto flight 9W-230 and Toronto-Delhi flight 9W-229 would be re-routed via Paris on that day, it said.
The airline is providing options like rescheduling of flights, postponing travel dates upto ten days from the original date without any fees or refunds without cancellation, to its passengers who have booked their travel through Brussels on December 15 and now wish to change their flight plans.
Belgium has been witnessing a series of strikes during the past few weeks which have disrupted several services, including ship movement, road, rail and air transport, with unions protesting austerity measures announced by the country's new government.
The series of regional strikes would be followed by a nationwide strike on December 15, reports from Brussels said.
Earlier, due to strike by major trade unions in Belgium on December 8, Jet had cancelled four flights to and from Brussels, as also to Newark and Toronto.

Germany confident India will find "practical solution" to language issue

("I can only tell you that…)
NEW DELHI: Germany today voiced confidence that the Modi government will find a "practical solution" to the issue of dropping German language as an alternative to Sanskrit in central schools.
"I can only tell you that I am and continue to be very confident that India will find a practical solution on this issue," German ambassador Michael Steiner told PTI.
Government's move to drop German as an alternative to Sanskrit as a third language in Kendriya Vidyalayas prompted German chancellor Angela Merkel to raise the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G 20 Summit in Australia last month. Modi assured Merkel of looking at it within the confines of the Indian system.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court also asked the Human Resource Development Ministry to consider continuing German for the present academic session.
Centre had stuck to its decision on replacing German as the third language with Sanskrit in Kendriya Vidyalayas but conceded that no exam would be conducted for the subject in the current session.
The HRD ministry decided to bring in Sanskrit in place of German as third language. Over 70,000 students across 500 Kendriya Vidyalayas from classes VI to VIII were asked to switch from German to Sanskrit.
The 2011 memorandum of understanding that made German a third language was signed between the Kendriya Vidyalayas and Goethe Institute-Max Mueller Bhawan.
Sanskrit teachers had moved the Delhi high court alleging that the central schools had introduced German as a third language in place of Sanskrit against the education policy.

Salaries may rise by 11% in 2015: SurveyMedical life Sciences expected to see highest projected hike
New Delhi, Dec 11:  
Salaries across industries are expected to increase by 11 per cent, according to Mercer’s 2014 India All Industries Total Remuneration Survey.
“Although the salary increase for 2014 across industries and career levels was at 10.6 per cent, the forecasted increase for 2015 is 11 per cent,” the survey, which was released on Thursday, said.
Sector-wise, the expected salary hike for the medical life sciences sector is the highest at 12 per cent and lowest for the shared services and hi-tech sector at 10 per cent, it said.
“While the consumer goods industry has projected 11 per cent hike on the back of improvement in consumer demand, the chemical and auto sectors have projected 10.8 per cent and 10.1 per cent increase, respectively,” the survey added.
Shanthi Naresh, India Business Leader – Information Solutions, Mercer, said, “Overall the current pay increase forecasts indicate that while business sentiment is positive, companies await the sentiment to turn into actual business results before taking aggressive pay actions.”
As far as attrition is concerned, it was 10.3 per cent in 2013 with the highest in the hi-tech sector at 15 per cent followed by the shared services sector at 14.6 per cent. As of June 2014, 6.5 per cent attrition had been recorded across sectors, the survey said.

Iron ore prices at 5-year low on excess supplyIron ore prices at 5-year low on excess supply
Dilip Kumar Jha | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 10:34 PM IST
Iron ore prices have declined to a five-year low on falling demand from China and more of oversupply from the world’s two largest miners, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.
After a high of $163 a tonne in 2011, ore started falling as China, the world’s largest consumer, ordered closure of small and non-viable steel mills. Ore is currently traded at $73 a tonne in the spot Chinese market, a level not seen since September 2009.
The price declined has been 39 per cent so far this calendar year. Analysts forecast a further decline to $63-64 a tonne on excavation in new mines. The falling prices will directly benefit steel mills in India and abroad.
“The world market is expected to face an oversupply of around 70 million tonnes in calendar year (CY) 2014, as compared to almost negligible supply excess in 2013.  BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have intensified excavation on existing mines and new mines have added their output. New origins like Iran and South Africa have also started supplying ore to Chinese steel mills,” said Prakash Duvvuri, an analyst with Ore Team, a Delhi-based research house.
JPMorgan has forecast the price to extend its decline. The bank lowered its forecast from the earlier estimates by 24 per cent to average $67 a tonne this year and 23 per cent lower than earlier estimates at $65 a tonne in 2016.
HSBC Holdings, reports said, forecast global seaborne iron ore supply to exceed demand by 100 mt in CY 2014 as compared to a mere 16 mt in CY 2013. The bank forecast the average iron ore price at $99 a tonne this year and $85 a tonne in 2015.
While mining activities have been very slow in India, a 30 per cent export duty has made shipment of ore unviable. Barring a small quantity exported from Odisha, there is no shipment at present from the country including from Goa, which until a few years earlier was producing 90 mt annually of low-grade ore for export to China.
“There has been no iron ore export from October onwards, as falling prices make Indian exports with 30 per cent duty unviable,” said R K Sharma, secretary general, Federation of Indian Mineral Industries.
Exports were 14.4 mt in 2013-14, a fall of 21.5 per cent from the 18.4 mt in 2012-13.

2015 Mercedes GLE-CouperevealedBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 6:16 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 6:20 pm
Mercedes has dropped the veil off the all-new GLE-Coupe ahead of its global premier at the 2015 Detroit Auto Show. The GLE-Coupe is Mercedes’ answer to the BMW X6, which till now had no direct competitor in the market. The GLE-Coupe is a cross-breed vehicle that takes style elements from a sports-coupe, but under the skin is a rugged SUV! The GLE-Coupe is likely to go on sale in global markets during the first quarter of 2015.
Technically, the Mercedes GLE-Coupe is based on the current ML-Class platform. However, as per the company’s latest nomenclature, the ML-Class will also have to be rebadged as GLE-Class once its face-lift arrives in 2015. Along with a new name, the GLE-Coupe also introduces Mercedes’ new ‘AMG Sports’ range. This range will comprise slightly higher performance vehicles than standard models with added visual tweaks. The AMG Sports range will directly compete against the BMW M-Performance and Audi’s S range of car. Do also note that all these three German firms- Mercedes, BMW and Audi have separate divisions for full-blown high-end performance cars in form of AMG, M-Division and RS models, respectively.
The GLE-Coupe will be made available with 3 engine options- 2 petrol and 1 diesel engine. The top-end petrol variant, GLE450 AMG Coupe, will be offered with a twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre V6 petrol engine rated at 367PS and 520Nm. The second petrol variant will use the same engine but with a less powerful state of engine tune-333PS of power and 480Nm of torque.
The diesel variant, dubbed the GLE350d Coupe, will feature a 3.0-litre V6 turbo diesel engine that develops 258PS of power and 620Nm of peak-torque. All engines come mated to Mercedes’ 9G-Tronic automatic transmission, which will channel the drive to all four wheels via Mercedes’ 4MATIC permanent all-wheel-drive system.
At a later stage, Mercedes will also add a full-fledged high-performance AMG version of the GLE-Coupe. It is likely to come fitted with either the newly developed 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 or the old 5.5-litre AMG V8. It will be badged as GLE63 AMG Coupe.
The GLE Coupe comes with 5 selectable driving modes. AIRMATIC or air suspension with a continuously variable damping system is also offered on the new car. Inside, the car can seat five individuals, and features the latest version of Mercedes’ COMAND infotainment system, featuring a tablet-style 8.0-inch screen with a console-mounted touchpad.
Mercedes will reveal more details about the GLE-Coupe during its world debut at the forthcoming Detroit Motor Show, starting January 2015.

Treasury 30-year bond returns are topping 25 percent for the first year since 2011, driven by the outlook for low inflation, before the U.S. sells $13 billion of the securities today.
The debt has gained 27 percent, the most since a 36 percent advance during the European debt crisis three years ago, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Tumbling commodity prices and weakening global economic growth are helping keep costs in check and inflaming demand for fixed-income assets around the world. Data today and tomorrow are forecast by economists to show U.S. producer prices fell as retail sales and consumer confidence rose.
“While the U.S. economy is growing, there is a sense in the market that global growth remains sluggish and the inflation outlook is likely to stay benign,” said Richard Kelly, a senior strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank in London . “That explains why long-dated Treasuries are outperforming shorter-dated bonds and that trend will probably to continue in the near term.”
Thirty-year yields dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.81 percent at 7:32 a.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 3 percent note due November 2044 rose 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 103 3/4. U.S. benchmark 10-year note yields fell two basis points to 2.15 percent, and touched 2.14 percent, the lowest since Oct. 21.
European bonds joined the rally in longer-maturity debt, with Germany ’s 30-year yield falling below 1.5 percent for the first time and Britain’s dropping to a record 2.586 percent.
Too Costly?
This year’s rally is raising concern Treasuries are becoming too costly.
At the last U.S. 30-year sale in November, investors bid for 2.29 times the amount of debt offered. It was the lowest level since May at the monthly auctions.
“As we look into 2015, Treasuries here probably are veering on the expensive side,” said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Sydney. “We are looking for high yields over ’15.”
U.S. 10-year yields will rise to 3.11 percent by the end of next year, based on a Bloomberg survey of economists, with the most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings. The rate on 30-year bonds is forecast to rise to 3.80 percent.
The Federal Reserve will also increase its benchmark interest rate , the target for overnight loans between banks, next year, based on the responses.
Inflation Outlook
Long bonds are reaping the biggest gains as the outlook for inflation dims. Low costs help protect the value of a bond’s fixed payments.
The difference between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt, narrowed to 1.7 percent this week. It was the lowest level in more than three years and compares to the average of 2.18 percent for the past decade.
Globally, bond investors anticipate consumer prices will rise an average 1.14 percent a year, the lowest since June 2013, based on yields of government debt for developed nations included in indexes compiled by Bank of America Corp.
The Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) extended its decline to the lowest levels since 2009 this week.
U.S. retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month from October, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the report today.
Producer prices fell in November and consumer confidence extended its advance to a seven-year high, reports tomorrow will show, based on responses from economists.

Reduce Sun TV Network, recommends Kotak Securities
Kotak Securities has recommended a reduce rating on Sun TV Network, in its December 11, 2014 research report.
Post your opinion here
Kotak Securities' report on Sun TV Network
"Following the recent run-up in Sun TV Network (16% since our last update), we downgrade the stock to REDUCE (ACCUMULATE earlier). While improving economic sentiment, recent developments in the cable environment are a long-term positive for entertainment broadcasters in general (this explains why we have raised our price target to Rs 390, from Rs 358 earlier), we continue to be worried about the changing competitive scenario in some of Sun TV's markets. As of now, there is little evidence to indicate a turnaround in the two languages where Sun TV channels are lagging (Telugu and Malayalam). Sun TV faces several risks, including imposition of the '10+2' rule across channels, and potential for higher capital requirements (both on movies and on other content), especially if ratings do not pick up significantly in the coming quarters. In these circumstance, we believe the run-up adequately captures the long-term positives that may accrue to Sun TV from industry positives (better advertising environment, potential for better long-term subscription revenue flows to broadcasters)", says Kotak Securities research report.

Tata Chemicals to invest Rs 150 crore in nutraceutical plant near ChennaiTata Chemicals to invest Rs 150 crore in nutraceutical plant near Chennai
BS Reporter | Chennai Dec 11, 2014 06:04 PM IST
Tata Chemicals Ltd, part of $100 billion plus Tata Group, is expected to invest around Rs 150 crore into setting up a nutraceuticals manufacturing facility in Sriperumbudur, near Chennai in next three years. The company is expecting its branded and non-commodity business, which is currently at 22 per cent of the turnover, to to up to 50 per cent in next seven years.
Speaking to the reporters in the sidelines of the launch of "Salt of the Earth: The Story of Tata Chemicals" authored by Philip Chacko and Christabelle Noronha, R Mukundan, managing director of Tata Chemicals said that the production in the greenfield facility has started and an official launch is scheduled by the end of this month. The size of the relevant market the company is looking at would be $5-7 billion internationally, he added.
The company is in talks with various players in various parts of the world for exports of nutraceutical products and it would be primarily to the European and other Asian countries. Pharmaceutical companies are the buyers for these products.
Tata Group, which has its presence in real estate space did not invest in a big in manufacturing in Tamil Nadu, except for a plant for Titan, which has set up a manufacturing facility to manufacture personal accessories. Tata Group's Tata Steel Limited was planning to invest around Rs 2,000 crore to set up a titanium dioxide (TiO2) plant, but the project never became reality for various reasons.
The facility is manufacturing Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), a probiotic product, as a beginning and would have more products in future. The initial capacity of 1,000 tonnes was set up with an investment of Rs 50 crore and it is expected to be scaled up to 5,000 tonne in next three years and the total investment would be around Rs 150 crore. The plant, at its full capacity could generate a revenue of around Rs 300 crore in three years, he added.
Commenting on the company's strategy, he said that it will be focusing on the farm solutions and food products business.
"Our current portfolio of branded and non-commodity business is 22 per cent. We would ideally want these products to go to at least 50 per cent in the next seven years," he said. Around Rs 4,500 crore of the company's Rs 7,000 crore business is in fertilisers at present. It has set up the Pune research facility with an idea to change from a chemical based company to biochemical and nanotech based company, he added.
The company, which has been selling salt across the country, has started selling pulses and dal to currently 40,000 stores mainly in North India and plans are to increase it to 1,00,000 stores by the year end and later bring it to the South Indian market. It is selling Chilli, Turmeric and Coriander along with other products under the Tata i-Shakti brand. The business of dal is currently at around Rs 100 crore, which would grow to over Rs 200 crore this year, while the seeds business under its subsidiary Metahelix Lifesciences is growing almost 80 per cent.
The company entered into the business as part of its Grow More Pulses programme, when the farmers said that they dont have a market sell the products. It is working with farmers in almost 87 per cent of the water scarce locations across the country. Besides pulses, it is also working with farmers to bring grapes, pomogranate, turmeric and ginger to the customers.
When asked whether the company would look at setting up a fertiliser facility in South India, especially Tamil Nadu, he said that the company does not see any opportunity for it, as the feed stock is not available and the company also decided not to go where there is a lots of subsidy. If the situation changes, the company would look at the options, he added. He said that for the customised fertiliser, from the company, there is an increase in demand this year, compared to previous years.

States oppose GST Bill as Centre fails to address concernsStates oppose GST Bill as Centre fails to address concerns on petro tax
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 19:22 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
In a setback to the Centre, the draft Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill was rejected by the States on Thursday on reasons that it did not address their concerns, particularly on entry tax and taxation of petroleum products.
At a meeting of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, the Centre's plan to bring petroleum goods under the new indirect tax regime was opposed. They also objected to the Constitutional Amendment Bill as it does not contain provisions for giving States compensation against any possible loss of revenue after GST roll-out for five years.
In a bid to roll out the GST, which would subsume excise and service taxes, the Centre has come out with a new Constitutional Amendment Bill.
The GST roll-out has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the proposed new tax regime .
"There is no consensus between the Centre and States on these three things (compensation issue, petrol tax and entry tax). The Empowered Committee is not supporting the Bill without these three things," the panel's Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather said after a meeting of the state Finance Ministers.
Rather stressed that the central government would have to respect views of the States.
The States want that the Centre to compensate them for any loss of revenue on implementation of the GST for five years and a clause regarding the compensation be included in the Constitution Amendment Bill, Rather said.
The State governments are also keen on keeping the entry tax and tax on petroleum products out of the ambit of the GST.
"The government hasn't agreed to our recommendations made last time, except one recommendation. We had said that the share of Union government in GST should go to the divisible pool and should be devolved among States, that has been agreed by Centre," Rather said.  
The panel head said that the draft of the new Constitutional Amendment Bill , which was received by the Committee earlier in December, did not take on board the suggestions of the state Finance Ministers. But the panel was surprised to learn that government had agreed with only one recommendation made by the committee with regard to putting GST in divisible pool, he added.
Meanwhile, Rather welcomed the decision of the Centre to release Rs 11,000 crore to States as compensation towards the central sales tax (CST) in the current financial year.
The move will settle the claim of CST compensation up to the year 2010-11, he said, adding that the compensation for latter years would be discussed with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
CST, a tax imposed on the inter-state movement of goods, was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in 2007-08 and further to 2 per cent in 2008-09 after the introduction of Value-Added Tax (VAT).

States reject GST Bill as Centre fails to address concernsStates oppose GST Bill as Centre fails to address concerns on petro tax

In a setback to the Centre, the draft Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill was rejected by the States on Thursday on reasons that it did not address their concerns, particularly on entry tax and taxation of petroleum products.
At a meeting of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, the Centre's plan to bring petroleum goods under the new indirect tax regime was opposed. They also objected to the Constitutional Amendment Bill as it does not contain provisions for giving States compensation against any possible loss of revenue after GST roll-out for five years.
In a bid to roll out the GST, which would subsume excise and service taxes, the Centre has come out with a new Constitutional Amendment Bill.
The GST roll-out has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the proposed new tax regime .
"There is no consensus between the Centre and States on these three things (compensation issue, petrol tax and entry tax). The Empowered Committee is not supporting the Bill without these three things," the panel's Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather said after a meeting of the state Finance Ministers.
Rather stressed that the central government would have to respect views of the States.
The States want that the Centre to compensate them for any loss of revenue on implementation of the GST for five years and a clause regarding the compensation be included in the Constitution Amendment Bill, Rather said.
The State governments are also keen on keeping the entry tax and tax on petroleum products out of the ambit of the GST.
"The government hasn't agreed to our recommendations made last time, except one recommendation. We had said that the share of Union government in GST should go to the divisible pool and should be devolved among States, that has been agreed by Centre," Rather said.  
The panel head said that the draft of the new Constitutional Amendment Bill , which was received by the Committee earlier in December, did not take on board the suggestions of the state Finance Ministers. But the panel was surprised to learn that government had agreed with only one recommendation made by the committee with regard to putting GST in divisible pool, he added.
Meanwhile, Rather welcomed the decision of the Centre to release Rs 11,000 crore to States as compensation towards the central sales tax (CST) in the current financial year.
The move will settle the claim of CST compensation up to the year 2010-11, he said, adding that the compensation for latter years would be discussed with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
CST, a tax imposed on the inter-state movement of goods, was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in 2007-08 and further to 2 per cent in 2008-09 after the introduction of Value-Added Tax (VAT).
The Centre had then promised the States that it would bear losses due to reduction of CST.

Coalition govts a hindrance in policy making: ArjunMundaBy: Press Trust of India | Ranchi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 6:43 pm
Former Chief Minister Arjun Munda, who headed coalition governments three times in Jharkhand, on Thursday said policy making gets hindered if there is no majority.
“Policy making gets delayed,” Munda said at a press conference here when asked how a coalition dispensation obstructs proper functioning of the government.
“Such situations are loss to the state,” Munda, who twice saw his government falling to coalition pulls and pressures – once by ex-CM Madhu Koda and his ex-cabinet colleagues and then by the JMM, said.
The leader of the opposition also accused the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) of failing in its governance for the past 14 months.
Lashing out at his former coalition partner JMM, which was now heading a coalition, Munda sought to know where were its issues (that led it to pull out from Munda’s government) and why the JMM and the Congress were fighting against each other despite being coalition partners.
“This government has failed in its fourteen months of rule,” he alleged.
Seeking to know what the Hemant Soren government achieved during the period, Munda alleged both the Congress and the JMM misled the people in the name of secularism.
“JMM says BJP will change CNT/SPT Acts. It is this government which tried to mortgage tribal land,” Munda said while dismissing JMM’s charges.
He added the BJP functions as per its manifesto, referring to the document not mentioning Chhota Nagpur Tenancy Act and Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act. The acts protect tribal land in Jharkhand.
Criticising RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s statements on development during his electioneering, Munda said the former Bihar chief minister did not have the right to speak on development.
Attacking AICC general secretary B K Hariprasad for accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of speaking ‘lies’, Munda sought to know from the Rajya Sabha member as to what Congress did in its sixty years rule.

Audi A3 Cabriolet launched at Rs 44.75lakhBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 6:25 pm
Audi has driven-in the drop-top version of the Audi A3 with a price-tag of Rs 44.75 lakh (ex-showroom, pan-India) in the country. Billed as the Audi A3 Cabriolet, the new convertible was previewed at the 2014 Delhi Auto Expo along with the A3 Sedan. While the A3 sedan available here is locally-assembled, the A3 Cabriolet will be sold in India via CBU (completely built units) route.
The Audi A3 Cabriolet is Audi’s second convertible offering after the Audi R8 V10 Spyder in India. The A3 Cabriolet does not have any direct competitor as of now, and hence, it becomes the most affordable premium convertible in the country. Aimed at young and aspirational luxury car buyers, the A3 Cabriolet is a mix of stylish looks, classic interiors, luxury features and sorted dynamics- all of which make for an unparalleled alfresco motoring experience. Audi is confident that this particular trait of the car will help attract decent number of niche-segment car buyers.
Unlike the A3 Sedan, Audi will be offering the cabriolet version in only one engine option. The powertrain on offer in the A3 Cabriolet is a 1.8 litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine that develops 180PS of power between 5,100 rpm and 6,200 rpm and 250Nm of torque from as low as 1,250 rpm to 5,000 rpm. Audi prefers running the engine on sulphur-free 95 RON type fuel. The drive from the engine is
routed to front wheels via a seven-speed S-tronic automatic gearbox. Performance is brisk, too, with the drop-top claimed to hit 0-100 km/h in just 7.8 seconds. The top-speed is 242 km/h (claimed).
Apart from two fewer doors and a fabric roof, the A3 Cabriolet is almost identical to the A3 Sedan styling wise. And we don’t think anybody should be complaining about that since the A3 sedan is one of the best looking compact luxury cars available in the market today. Like the sedan version, the A3 Cabriolet sports Audi-signature daytime running LED lamps, bi-xenon headlamps, hexagonal grille etc. The roof, like mentioned before, is made up of soft fabric and it can be completely concealed at a touch of a button behind the rear passenger seats. To open or retract the roof it only takes 18 seconds. The function only operates to speeds up to 50km/h.
Inside, the A3 cabriolet gets a ‘sporty’ flat-bottom steering wheel and borrows rest of dashboard layout, material and equipment from the A3 Sedan. The interior is finished in dual-tone and features four Jet turbine shaped circular A/C vents, a 3.5-inch multimedia screen that juts out from the upper dashboard and a dual analogue dial instrument cluster. Safety features like ABS, ESP, Airbags come fitted as standard.
It won’t be apt to say that practicality on continued…

NCP chief Sharad Pawar undergoes surgery  likely to be discharged in next fewdaysBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 11, 2014 6:25 pm
Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and Rajya Sabha member Sharad Pawar is likely to be discharged in the next few days, party member Nawab Malik said Thursday. “His condition is improving. Doctors will fix a date for his discharge any time now,” Malik told The Indian Express.
Pawar was admitted to the Breach Candy Hospital here on December 3 after he accidentally slipped at his New Delhi residence and fractured his right upper thigh.
On December 5, the MP underwent a surgery.
Pawar had been airlifted from Delhi to Mumbai after he expressed his wish to be treated in the hospital where he frequently visits for routine check-ups.
“He is meeting everyone and the pain has subsided now. He is speaking and recovering well,” said a sources close to Pawar.
The NCP supremo is currently under the care of orthopaedic surgeon Dr Arun Bipin Mullaji.

ISSAQUAH, Wash. (AP) — Sales from the established stores of warehouse club operator Costco climbed 5 percent last month to top Wall Street expectations.
Analysts expected 3.7 percent growth, on average, according to Thomson Reuters.
The strong results come even though Costco stayed closed on Thanksgiving -- unlike many other retailers. Increasing competition for Black Friday shoppers has led many stores in recent years to start their holiday "doorbusters" a day early.
"Our employees work especially hard during the holiday season, and we simply believe that they deserve the opportunity to spend Thanksgiving with their families," Paul Latham, a spokesman for Costco, told The Huffington Post last year.
The Issaquah, Washington, company said Thursday that same-store sales from its U.S. locations climbed 7 percent, while they fell 1 percent internationally.
Sales at stores open at least a year is a key gauge of a retailer's health because it excludes the volatility from stores recently opened or closed.
The company said the Midwest Southeast and San Diego areas led U.S. results. Mexico, Taiwan and Canada were strong internationally.
Excluding lower gasoline prices and foreign currency fluctuations, sales at stores open at least a year increased 8 percent for the company, 9 percent in the United States and 7 percent internationally.
Costco's total November sales rose 7 percent to $9.43 billion, and revenue for its first quarter, which ended Nov. 23, also climbed 7 percent to $26.28 billion.
The company runs 671 warehouses, including 474 in the United States and Puerto Rico.
Shares climbed 81 cents to $143.50 Thursday before markets opened. The stock had climbed about 20 percent so far this year, as of Wednesday's market close.

Is the Buddha Smiling on Narendra Modi s Indiareddit
NEW DELHI -- Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi seldom speaks in Parliament, and also refrains from interacting with the Indian media, the only source one can turn to in order to appraise his record in office are his own words and actions and, no less significant, his studied silence on matters that cause grave anxiety to large swathes of  public opinion.
His moves to energize the country's Leviathan bureaucracy and to compel it to be tightly focused on his government's priorities -- rapid economic growth and the strengthening of India's security and strategic interests -- continue to win him plaudits from world leaders, Indian and foreign corporate giants and, not least, from the Indian diaspora across continents.
But such enthusiasm comes with plenty of caveats. In line with its " Make in India " mantra, the Modi government, known to be pro-business, has taken some steps to facilitate private sector involvement in areas like infrastructure, railways, insurance and defense, especially if it includes transfer of sophisticated technology. But it is yet to announce major reforms that would boost domestic and foreign investment.
India's standing on this count leaves much to be desired. Investors seek swift decisions whether these relate to labor laws, land acquisition, clearances at various levels of governance, taxation, flexible credit policies and environmental laws and so forth. These measures, it is widely believed, will be rolled out when the annual budget is announced early next year.
Other than the failure to fulfill his election promise that he would bring back " black money " -- billions of dollars that Indians have illegally stashed abroad -- within a hundred days, Modi has sent all the right signals on the economic front. However, his silence on certain other fronts causes much disquiet. While he has launched a high-profile campaign to improve the abysmal sanitary conditions in the country, he has yet to reveal a comprehensive strategy to address India's dismal ranking in the U.N.'s Human Development Index.
Moreover, his human resource development minister, Smriti Irani, has appointed individuals sympathetic to Hindu right-wing organizations but with dubious scholarly credentials to head a number of prestigious educational institutions. She has also changed curriculum in schools to reflect the highly contested views of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ruling dispensation's ideological mentor.
Of even greater concern is the prime minister's stubborn refusal to rap on the knuckles leaders of his party and his extended ideological family, including a couple of his ministers, for indulging in hate speech targeting minorities, especially Muslims. Such diatribes have served to polarize opinion along religious lines. There is some evidence to suggest that the polarization has benefited the Bharatiya Janata Party , Modi's political formation, in national and state elections. But it has also alienated the minorities and, in extreme instances, pushed young, educated Muslims to embrace radical Islam and even to make common cause with national and international terror groups .
FOREIGN POLICY SUCCESS
On foreign policy, however, the prime minister's success has exceeded all expectations. He sprang a surprise when he invited leaders of South Asian nations to witness his oath-taking ceremony. This was a clear indication of one of his priorities: to establish close and mutually beneficial relations with India's neighbors. Regional peace, he correctly reckoned, would give him more elbow room to deal with major world powers.
The first of his eight visits abroad was to tiny Bhutan . No one could miss its symbolic significance. His two visits to Nepal went beyond symbolism. With his emphasis on undertaking joint projects, especially in power generation, he wowed that country's Parliament and public opinion at large. His government has also reached out to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Afghanistan to strengthen economic and strategic ties.
The only country in the neighborhood that has proved to be highly problematic to Modi is Pakistan. The presence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at his oath-taking ceremony had kindled hopes of a slow but steady improvement in India-Pakistan relations. But tensions on the border, Islamabad's refusal to crack down on terror groups that had staged violent attacks on Indian soil, its moves to raise the Kashmir issue in international forums and its molly-coddling of Kashmiri separatists led New Delhi to cancel a scheduled meeting of the foreign secretaries of the two countries.
The strain in this bilateral relation was in full evidence at the SAARC summit in Kathmandu in November. While it ended with a handshake between the two prime ministers, there is little doubt that their ties will continue to be tense.
Part of the reason is the internal situation in Pakistan. It has severely undermined Sharif's authority. The other part is New Delhi's conviction that Pakistan's powerful army, and especially its intelligence agency, ISI, is resolutely against normalization of relations with India since this would erode the preponderant role it has been playing in determining the country's foreign and strategic policies.
Where Modi has scored, however, is in convincing three major countries -- Japan , the U.S. and Australia -- as well as some smaller ones like Vietnam and Fiji -- that India can be trusted to be a serious economic and strategic partner.
On the first count, he has assured them that he will do all that it takes to provide a congenial environment for their investors. And on the latter count, he has guaranteed them that India would strain every nerve to realize their shared goals: maritime security, peaceful settlement of disputes, zero tolerance for terrorism, transparent commerce etc. Moreover, he has signaled to them that his government would not come in the way of an international consensus on realizing the objectives of the World Trade Organization and those pertaining to climate change .
It is tempting to argue that these initiatives, not to mention his veiled criticism of Beijing for its muscle-flexing in the South China Sea , are intended, directly or otherwise, to contain China's growing power in Asia and beyond. That temptation must be resisted.
"Any ganging up against China, a vastly superior economic and military power, would be counter-productive."
Modi is a pragmatist. He knows that any ganging up against China, a vastly superior economic and military power, would be counter-productive. That is why he has decided to participate in two China-led projects -- the New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Bank -- that are meant to reduce western and Japanese influence over international financial institutions.
For much the same reason, he rolled out the red carpet for Xi Jinping. He dealt firmly with Chinese incursions on the Sino-Indian border that took place during the visit but, at the same time, got the Chinese leader to commit to vast investments in infrastructure and manufacturing. Also significant is his decision to appoint his closest aide on foreign policy and strategic affairs, Ajit Doval , the national security adviser, as India's representative for talks on the disputed border between the two countries.
Such robust pragmatism is bound to yield a richer harvest in the weeks to come. Vladimir Putin has come calling . His current visit is expected to result in raising Indo-Russian economic and strategic ties to a level unmatched in recent years.
More significant is  Modi's  diplomatic coup: President Barack Obama's decision to be the chief guest on India's Republic day on Jan. 26 next year. His statements during this visit, and the agreements both countries sign, should indicate the extent to which India in fact matters on the world stage.
KISSINGER WEIGHS IN
On this score, the observations of an influential analyst of world affairs merit attention. In his latest book, World Order, Henry Kissinger cautions that "with India, Japan and China all led by strong and strategically oriented administrations, the scope both for intensified rivalries and for potential bold resolutions will expand." He then goes on to add: "In any of these evolutions, India will be a fulcrum of twenty-first century order: an indispensable element, based on its geography, resources, and traditions of sophisticated leadership, in the strategic and ideological evolution of the regions and the concepts of order at whose intersection it stands."
Narendra Modi, who has demonstrated his ability to wield both hard power and soft power (Hinduism, Buddhism, cricket, Bollywood) to good effect, has his job cut out for him. He is aware that good fortune awaits India so long as the Buddha keeps smiling.

Here's why our motorcycles get dangerously overcrowded
As a people, we make convenient adjustments, accommodating ourselves to any situation. In the restaurant, we convert one bowl of soup into two. On the suburban train, we convert a three-seater bench into a four-seater, helping a stranger have a comfortable journey.
Sometimes, we make adjustments where we should not. On the road, we convert a two-wheeler into a train coach, our ‘adjusting’ heart preternaturally expanding the capacity of the motorcycle’s saddle to seat five, even six people.
Those who transform a motorcycle into a five-passenger carrier have obviously not thought through the dangers of travelling in this manner. The motorcycle becomes unstable. Manoeuvrability is compromised. Tyres are under severe pressure and prone to overheating, raising the possibility of blowouts. This particular risk increases if the journey is long and the total weight of the passengers is considerably high. A motoring enthusiast and journalist tells me motorcycles saddled with three full-grown adults and two children are a common sight on the highways of Rajasthan and Haryana. So are tyre blowouts due to such overloading.
Without trying to justify this reckless on-road behaviour, let’s explore the reasons for it. In distinctly rural areas, where the concept of last-mile connectivity is unheard of, let alone promoted, people are left to manage their local commutes with personal transport. Considering the majority of them are unlikely to have access to personal transport, this is an ironical situation.
The only way for most of them to reach their place of work is to latch on to a neighbour’s motorcycle. Who cares if you are the sixth passenger saddled up on the bike?
Many moons ago, during a trip to Javadhi Hills, this writer found out that the phrase ‘missing the bus’ was a felt reality for residents of the hamlets there. A rickety old bus, hardly frequent, was then the only economical option for residents of Amirdi to travel uphill to Nambiampattu, one of the few places where they could conduct commerce. Their livelihood hinged on being on time for the bus. If they missed it, the only other option was thumbing down a motorcycle or any other private vehicle headed uphill.
Five-passenger motorcycle rides are not restricted to such villages. They can be witnessed in areas fringing our cities. Thanks to urban sprawl, the city often arrives in these areas before development does. Even when it does, the development is focused only on the main corridors and much of the interior sections are inaccessible.
And for a massive number of workers, especially those in the construction industry, employment lies in those hidden areas. In the interior areas off Old Mahabalipuram Road, close to sections such as Kelambakkam and Navalur, it’s common to see chief masons taking four of their helpers on a bike, at a time, to their work site. For a living, they are forced to make this inadvisable adjustment.

J&K s stunning win in Ranji TrophyMore
Jammu & Kashmir take historic win over Mumbai
Jammu & Kashmir shocked domestic heavyweights Mumbai with a historic four-wicket win by chasing down 237 on the last day at the Wankhede Stadium

Jammu & Kashmir 254 (Khajuria 107) and 237 for 6 (Khajuria 78, Hardeep 41*) beat Mumbai 236 and 254 (Suryakumar 115, Dayal 5-75) by four wickets
Rasool: leading from the frontScorecard
It would have made perfect sense had the Jammu & Kashmir players charged from the sidelines once Obaid Haroon called Hardeep Singh for the winning single. Or if they had danced in the middle like a team that had just won a World Cup. Or if loud shrieks of joy had burst in the dressing room as the team assembled for a meeting. All would have been appropriate and fitting for the scale of their achievement, for Mumbai had only lost five Ranji matches at the Wankhede in the last 15 years, all of them to major teams. 
Instead, the J&K group just got up on the feet, shook each other's hands, embraced, and made a slow approach towards the pitch, as Hardeep took his light blue helmet off after completing the run and raised his bat towards them. They had been sitting by the boundary for a while, anxiously waiting and gorging on bananas, cheering every single without being overtly boisterous. Samiullah Beigh was padded up. He was there too, not inside the dressing room. Still, the muted reaction was quite a contradiction after they had brought a legendary team down on its turf. 
The only time it looked like the players were excited was when the news filtered that Sachin Tendulkar was in the Mumbai dressing room and the J&K players, most of whom were in Mumbai for the first time ever, could get a chance to meet him in person. Most of them ran back to the dressing room, waiting for Tendulkar to emerge and greet them. However, they were left a tad disappointed as Tendulkar left after a brief meet-up with their coach, Sunil Joshi, and their media manager. It was a minor low on a day of highs though and this team is pretty good in handling lows.
In the build-up to the season, the region was ravaged by devastating floods. When other teams were getting their pre-season preparations sorted, a J&K player was attending a funeral of a friend; when players around the country were spending time in gymnasiums, some J&K players were busy clearing up the mess the floods had left behind; when teams would have been planning of their home-match strategies, the J&K players had no clue where their home venue would be. As the water receded, J&K, among the big boys for the first time, realised they didn't have a home advantage to exploit this year. All their games were to be away matches, against Mumbai, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Bengal and others. It's one way to travel around the country, but not the one they would have chosen for sure.
Playing their first match at the Wankhede would have been nerve-wracking, but the team had taken some confidence from the win against a star-studded Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy earlier this season. Their players, including their impressive seamers, had also been part of the zonal teams this year. The team's confidence was also boosted, according to one J&K player, as they saw the grass being shaved off from the pitch once the locals had seen their seam attack. That seam-bowling group did go on to make an impression, picking up 14 wickets on what Parvez Rasool thought was a "dead" pitch.
Although J&K suffered a collapse in the first innings, a maiden century from Shubham Khajuria, an India Under-19, had ensured they had the lead - a lead in Mumbai. Beat that for a confidence-booster. So when they came out on the fourth morning with nine wickets in hand, 179 adrift of a historical win, they knew they had the wares to go all the way. An early wicket was lost, a 52-run partnership followed. Another wicket, then another partnership. 
Shardul Thakur tested Khajuria and Rasool with a bounce barrage, with his aggressive stares, with his frequent conversations, but then he sprayed it wide down the leg side for four and it signalled a change of momentum. Next over, the 46th, Khajuria whipped two superbly-timed boundaries, against the turn of Vishal Dabholkar, through midwicket. Then Rasool reverse-swept in the same over to pick up four more. But J&K have seen things are never that simple. They had lost five wickets for one run in the first innings; today they lost both set batsmen at the same score. Khajuria chipped one back to Iqbal Abdulla and Rasool was bowled round his legs by Dabholkar. 
Waseem Raza joined Hardeep ahead of Haroon and Beigh, a surprise move that seemed to have added hesitation among the batsmen rather than trouble the opposition. Twice, the two batsmen argued after completing ill-advised singles. There was hesitation a third time too, but Raza, going for a second, was well short of a throw from third man. However, the two had added a vital 44. 
There is nothing that gives as much relief to the batting team, and annoys the bowlers at the same time, as an outside edge. Hardeep got one through the vacant first slip off Thakur. Once that gap was plugged, Haroon got another through second slip off the same bowler. Those two edges had a finality to them; there were no more jitters and J&K strolled through, Hardeep playing a dogged hand of 41*. 
"Hardeep is a senior player. He won a game last year as well, against Goa," Rasool said after the win. "We were expecting him to draw from his experience and deliver for us. Shubham [Khajuria] played a tremendous innings. He has played India Under-19 and scored 160-odd at that level. We brought him from that level because we needed someone at the top. He has had a good impact since his arrival.
"Beating Mumbai in Mumbai is a big thing. But our graph has been going up for the last three years. People said that we will know the difference between Plate and Elite leagues this time, but this win will serve as an answer to them, and proves that we can play at this level."
There was that same calmness in Rasool's voice that had been in his team's body language at the win. It was an indication that J&K had not lost the perspective that this still was going to be a tough tournament for them. It was also a sign that they were not overawed by the gigantic steel and concrete structure that can, at times, be suffocating for visiting teams. But perhaps for a team hardened by tough experiences within and beyond the cricket field, a win against Mumbai in Mumbai was not an emotional big deal. It was just a matter of fact.

Norms for refinancing existing projects soon: RBIloans
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to come out with guidelines for banks on refinancing existing infrastructure projects, Deputy Governor S. S. Mundhra said here on Wednesday.
In July, norms were put in place by the central bank for new infrastructure projects and affordable housing in response to representations made by banks, which were facing difficulties in providing long-tenor financing owing to asset-liability mismatch.
Banks needed the flexibility to structure loans to mitigate risks as well as to ensure easy refinancing. Called the 5/25 system, this structure allowed banks to rewrite the terms of the loan of an asset (whose life may be of 25 years) every five years for the duration of the asset’s life cycle.
Efforts were now on to issue guidelines for existing projects too, Mr. Mundhra said.
Pointing out that getting finance was easy in India, Mr. Mundra cautioned industry against having thin equity. “This is like skating on thin ice… things become tricky when the economy slows down and then projects falter and signs of distress creep in,” he observed at an interactive meeting with the microfinance sector, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.
For the highly-leveraged companies, banks might demand higher equity before offering fresh loans, it was learnt.
Mr. Mundhra also advised banks as well as corporates not to live on a quarter-to-quarter basis as this often led to mindless chasing of profits and lowering of safeguards. “Quarter-to-quarter chasing can be detrimental to the health of business,” he observed.
On rate cuts
On the possibility of rate cuts, he said there was room for rate cuts in case inflation was reined in. Food prices were lower and oil prices were easing, he said, adding that uncertainties on factors such as monsoon would have to be taken cognisance of.
“RBI’s policy rests on five major planks, which included monetary policy, whose main component was inflation targeting.”
The central bank was keen to introduce more players in the market place, and by April, it hoped to issue licences for new category banks (payment banks). Universal banking licences would also be available on tap soon against the earlier practice of giving then out once in a decade.

12 Ways to Profit And Get Ready for 2015reddit
Here is a quick checklist of actions I'd be taking if I were you, so you can start the new year off on the right foot and get a running start towards reaching your goals for 2015.
Of course, these are all actions that I take myself every year.  Some require some extra effort, some fast attention - but all of them are well worth it.
The end of the year only rolls around once every 12 months, so make sure to make the most of it all.
In addition to maximizing the end of the year, you want to be primed for 2015, before it gets here.
So here's that list...
For your customers, clients or patients:
Send some sort of Holiday Greeting to them, show your appreciation. And remind them how smart they are to be your client at the same time.
Have some type of Holiday Sale, or campaign that enters the conversation already going on in their minds. They are buying tons of stuff from other people at this time of year, so why not you? (*Note that the appreciation and the sale are two different things. I've found it works best this way.)
Offer a special renewal program, where applicable (and if not, why don't you have some form of membership or continuity in your business? Make that a goal for 2015).
A "Get In While It's Still 2014 Pricing" is a great sale, for any type of premium product or service, or a membership program.  Use this in your message. It's a great motivator, and it's a great excuse for you to raise your prices so you can give yourself a raise come 2015.
Painstakingly go through your client database and allocate everyone into a VALUE Pyramid: Top 5%, Top 20%, Top 50%, Bottom 50%, etc.  Look at what can be done to move people up to the next level of value.  And then, most importantly, determine what you can do to keep your clients who are at the top, at the top, and what can be done to increase their value.  Now add this plan to the ones you'll work on in the upcoming months ahead.  Identify who your best clients are and where you can go and get more of them.
Map out your Client Relationship and Sales Campaigns for next year.  So many people look at this as being the ENTIRE business, but it's only a part of the business.  You should be focused at least 50% on getting MORE clients - not just selling to your current ones.  Of course you want to keep doing that, but just make sure it's not all you do.  So, here, you focus on KEEPING clients and SELLING them more of your products or services. Decide what you will do every month.  Take information from #5 above and apply it here.
For Yourself:
Take a look back at 2014 and make a list of everything that you did, tried, put into motion.  What worked, what didn't work.  What's new, what you have forgotten about.  Then dissect it, to figure out what you learned and what you can take with you into 2015.
Similar to #5 above - but specifically to your goals and numbers.  What were your real goals and benchmarks, and where are your numbers currently?  Decide what made it so.  And write down your plan for 2015 specifically about improving your numbers.
Now take #5 and #6 above and begin outlining your Marketing and Money plans for 2015:  What you'll do, start, try, implement.  How much money, how many clients, etc. will you have and where will you get them from?  Remember that your desired goals/numbers for 2015 will dictate the rest of your story, so make the plan that leads to the results that get you those numbers.
MY FAVORITE:  Make a list of all the adjustments, changes, new rules, and most fun, powerful and liberating of all: What you are going to eliminate for 2015.  Write down all of the frustrations, negative people, time wasters, and profit killers in your business and in your life in general.  Make the list and get to work; make December 31st your deadline to have this one fully in motion.
MY SECOND FAVORITE: Make the list of everything you want to tackle and try NEW for next year.  Make a list of everything you are going to do to make sure it happens, including the support you'll need.  For example, mark your schedule for the year, allocate time to read entrepreneur blogs like RhinoDaily.com (yes, daily), attend Mastermind Meetings (if applicable), study small business marketing training programs like SSSMarketingUniversity.com (if you're serious), get Personal Coaching (if you're lucky) and whatever else you know you need.  This is your Implementation Plan that ties into your "What's New" plan:  New business, new markets, new income streams, etc.
Now, this will be your favorite part:  Plan and schedule your vacations for next year.  You should be able to outline your 2015 calendar after completing #1-11 above. Now go back and decide when, where and how you'll take some time away.  There's no right amount, but you do need to put them into place. That gives you something to look forward to, and if you commit to them and tie goals to them, you're stuck, in a good way, to making sure you stay on track for the year and for your vacations.
Now, after all of that, you ought to be ready for Christmas and to take a break.
I know this all too well: With money and opportunity comes great responsibility, planning, and strategic thinking.  Nothing is by accident.
And the 12 Ways To Profit And Get Ready For 2015 are a perfect example of what it takes to make success happen ON PURPOSE.
Pace yourself. Do half one weekend and half another, then go back through each of them between Christmas and New Year's.
Just make sure you don't finish 2014 without a plan to start 2015.

Rainmaking lawyer leaves one Chicago firm for another0
For example, when Abbott Laboratories raised the price of a key HIV/AIDS drug by 400 percent in 2003, the decision unleashed a torrent of antitrust claims in state and federal courts, as well as regulatory investigations. Hurst and his Winston team represented Abbott in nearly every aspect of the litigation, according to American Lawyer magazine.
Hurst was not available for comment, according to a Kirkland spokeswoman.
Kirkland Chairman Jeffrey Hammes said in a statement: "Jim has earned acclaim as one of the finest trial lawyers in the country. His experience trying cases across a range of areas and industries, including in intellectual property disputes, made him a perfect fit for our practice and client base."
Thomas Fitzgerald, Winston's managing partner, said he was disappointed to see Hurst leave. "He is a great partner and a great friend," Fitzgerald said.
One of the reasons for Hurst's departure, Fitzgerald said, is that he could not represent pharmaceutical companies that sell brand-name drugs in intellectual property matters because he represented generic drugmakers in such issues at Winston.
At Kirkland, Hurst won't have the same conflict, Fitzgerald said.
"Obviously maintaining the generic clients is important to us," Fitzgerald said. "We have plenty of lawyers who can continue to represent those clients and we hope those clients will stay with us."

Comment
By Serena Maria Daniels
DETROIT, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Detroit will officially exit the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy later on Wednesday, officials said, allowing Michigan's largest city to start a new chapter with a lighter debt load.
The city, which filed for bankruptcy in July 2013, will shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations.
"We're going to start fresh tomorrow and do the best we can to deliver the kind of services people deserve," said Mayor Mike Duggan.
Once a symbol of U.S. industrial might, Detroit fell on hard times after decades of population loss, rampant debt and financial mismanagement left it struggling to provide basic services to residents.
Later on Wednesday, payments to city creditors will be triggered under a debt adjustment plan confirmed by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge last month.
Most of the settlements with major creditors, including Detroit's pension funds and bondholders, will be paid with a distribution of about $720 million of bonds. The city will also reissue $287 million of existing bonds and borrow about $275 million from Barclays Capital to finance its exit from bankruptcy.
Along with the debt, the exit plan relies heavily on the "Grand Bargain," where foundations, the state and the Detroit Institute of Art will contribute $816 million over time to ease pension cuts and protect city-owned art work from sale. The plan also aims to provide Detroit with $1.7 billion through June 30, 2023, to improve city services and infrastructure.
Wednesday also marks the end of Kevyn Orr's 21-month term as Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager. He told reporters that the city was wrapping up wire transfers, disbursements and other matters to end the historic bankruptcy.
"There may be some other administrative things the court may have to handle but the city will have emerged from bankruptcy," Orr said. "12:01 a.m. tomorrow morning the city will be out of bankruptcy. I will no longer be the emergency manager. I will be unemployed."
Orr's departure returns complete control of Detroit to Duggan and the nine-member city council. However, the city will have a nine-member, state-created oversight board in place to approve financial matters.
In confirming the bankruptcy plan, Judge Steven Rhodes raised questions about possible conflicts of interest from having Duggan and a city council member sit on the board.
"The city is running the city, with some financial oversight on budgetary matters," said Michigan Governor Rick Snyder about the financial review commission. "My goal is probably to have (the commission) be as least active as possible."
The Republican governor told Reuters in an interview that the commission will help ensure Detroit does not slip back into bankruptcy. He also ruled out direct financial aid to the city in the future.
"We're not really aiming to be there as a backup to the city in terms of financial resources," Snyder said. "We're there to be a supportive partner."
He added that many of the other 16 local governments and school districts under state oversight in Michigan are "transitioning out of their problems" without the aid of bankruptcy.
"People should not be aspiring to go into bankruptcy to solve your problems. It's tough process and it's a last resort."
Orr said court-ordered mediation on fees paid to consultants during the bankruptcy process was continuing on Wednesday. Outside lawyers and consultants charged the city more than $140 million, sparking protests from Duggan. Orr said some of the issues were "resolved last week."
With the exit, "all of the consultants are being phased out pretty quickly," Duggan said. (Writing and additional reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago and Lisa Lambert in Washington; editing by Matthew Lewis)

Man City complete great escape in RomeMan City complete great escape in Rome

Manchester City's goalkeeper Joe Hart (L) makes a save during the Champions League …
ROME (Reuters) - Manchester City concluded one of the great Champions League Houdini acts on Wednesday as they qualified for the knockout stages with goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta sinking Roma 2-0 to eliminate the Italians at the Stadio Olimpico.
The Frenchman's 60th-minute thunderbolt, before he laid on a second for the Argentine in the 86th minute, ensured the English champions did not suffer another frustrating early exit in Group E.
City's great escape into the last 16 seemed unthinkable when they trailed in their penultimate game at home to Bayern Munich with just five minutes remaining before Sergio Aguero completed his famous hat-trick.
Victory or a score draw offered City's most realistic chance of progressing from the group behind Bayern Munich in a fevered atmosphere in Rome and even without their injured totem Aguero, Manuel Pellegrini's men produced a performance full of resolve.
Nasri, given too much space on the edge of the box, hammered a glorious 20-metre shot which cannoned off the post and into the net, and City defended manfully before Nasri freed the rampaging Zabaleta to score his first Champions League goal.
"People wrote us off without our key players (like Aguero and Vincent Kompany) but we're a strong unit, we believed in what we could do," City keeper Joe Hart told Sky Sports.
"You don't win two Premier League titles in three years easily. We have resolve, character and fantastic players. Add that together and you've got a chance."
With various permutations at the start of the night leaving it possible for Roma, City or CSKA Moscow to join Bayern in the last 16, the game effectively became an Anglo-Italian shootout once news of Bayern's early lead over the Russians filtered through.
The English champions had their moments in the first half, especially when James Milner twice forced sharp saves from Morgan De Sanctis.
Hart then stepped up with some crucial stops from the moment he spread himself to block Jose Holebas's fifth minute shot from point-blank range.
As the hour mark approached, Roma seemed to be running out of ideas when the in-form Nasri celebrated his 50th appearance in the competition with a marvellous goal.
Roma, by now needing to score twice, came closest when Hart  made another crucial intervention to push Kostas Manolas's header on to the post and Martin Demichelis blocked a shot on the line before Zabaleta calmed City nerves.
Roma had the minor consolation of qualifying for the Europa League, ahead of CSKA Moscow who lost 3-0 at Bayern in their final group match.

A suicide bomber killed six Afghan soldiers in an attack on a military minibus on Thursday, officials said, in the first attack in the capital Kabul for more than a week.
Another 10 people were wounded, said Farid Afzali, the chief of criminal investigation for Kabul police. He said the wounded included civilians but could give no further details.
The attack happened on a busy road in the east of the city during the morning rush hour.
“The suicide bomber was on foot,” said Hashmat Stanikzai, spokesman for the Kabul provincial police chief.
The Taliban claimed responsibility.
The attack marks the resumption of an intensified anti-government campaign by the insurgents after a lull in attacks on targets in the city.
In recent weeks, the insurgents have targeted military, diplomatic and foreign installations in and around Kabul, in what appears to be a change in tactics to gain maximum publicity.

Srinagar: Law student attacked with acidA woman suffered severe burn injuries after acid was thrown in her face on Thursday afternoon.
 
The victim, a 21-year-old law student, was attacked by two unknown men outside a law school at Nowshera, in the outskirts of Srinagar.
 
Police have begun hunt for the assailants. “As of now we don’t know what actually happened as the girl is undergoing operation. The details will be known only when the girl is in a position to talk,” a police spokesperson said.
 
But eyewitnesses said two persons came in a car, intercepted the law student on the road outside the college and threw acid on her. They sped away as  people gathered.
 
The girl was hospitalised in an unconscious state with severe burns on her face and hands.
 
As news of attack spread, students took to the streets to protest.
Last year, a young teacher was attacked by a youth, and a Srinagar court sent him to jail for 10 years for the crime.

Russia to supply rough diamonds worth $2.1 bn to IndiaIndian companies ink pact to buy $2.1 bn diamonds from Russia
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 19:27 IST

In a bid to create alternative import sources of rough diamonds for the Indian cutting and polishing industry, Russia's state-led Alrosa mining group has entered into direct selling agreements with 12 diamantaires for supplies worth $2.1 billion over three years.
Some of the top Indian exporters of cut and polished diamonds will benefit from the deal that is expected to create an alternative source of roughs for India, which is the world's largest hub for this industry, accounting for nearly 80 per cent of volume, officials said.
Russia is the top producer of roughs and Alrosa controls around 27 percent of global trade.
The agreements were signed coinciding with Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit in India for the 15th India-Russia Annual Summit, during which he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also attended the World Diamond Conference.
"We are looking at steady supply of rough diamonds to India. Alrosa has decided to have 12 direct sales agreement with India companies," said Siddharth, Director General of Supplies and Disposals, the nodal government agency for procurements.
"This deal is worth $700 million per year for three years," said Siddharth, who uses one name.
Normally, the way deals in the global rough diamonds industry work is once a definite contract is signed, the buyers have to lift the specified value of consignment each year, irrespective of the fluctuations in prices, demand and supply.
India imported 163.11 million carats of rough diamonds worth $16.34 billion in 2013 and exported 36.46 million carats of polished diamonds valued at $20.23 billion. The bulk of the supplies came from the Antwerp-based De Beers, which is said to control some 40 percent of global roughs trade.
The companies that will benefit from the latest deal are Rosy Blue, Diamond India, Hari Krishna Exports, Dimexon Diamonds, Jasani Group, Asian Star, Kiran Gems, KGK Diamonds, Shri Ramkrishna Exports, Venus Jewel, Karp Group, and Sheetal Group.
Andrey Polyakov, vice-president of Alrosa, said: "Diamond business is sensitive. The main thing is to raise consumption in India and China."
It is estimated that by the end of this decade India and China together will consume 40 per cent of global diamond market and will become at par with the US, which is now leading the market.
The total amount of gems and jewellery exported from India in 2013-14 was worth $39 billion, of which $24 billion were diamond.

Funds raised by listed companies through retail issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) almost halved to Rs 6,912 crore during first eight months of the ongoing 2014-15 financial year as compared to the corresponding period in FY14.
NCDs are loan-linked bonds that cannot be converted into stocks and usually offer higher interest rates than convertible debentures.
An amount of Rs 15,021.73 crore was garnered by companies through 12 issues of NCDs during April-November 2013, as per latest data compiled by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

The highest amount (Rs 1,974 crore) was garnered by Shriram Transport Finance Company in July, followed by IFCI (Rs 1,209.19 crore) in November.
Gold financing company Muthoot Finance raised funds worth Rs 466.19 crore through an issue in June and another Rs 397.78 crore in September.
Among others, ECL Finance mopped up Rs 400 crore, SREI Infrastructure Finance's issue garnered Rs 326.14 crore, Manappuram Finance's issue amounted to Rs 278.55 crore and Muthoottu Mini Financiers mobilised Rs 269.13 crore, in the 2014-15 fiscal.

Bengal deputy speaker assaults apartment resident  says  I m the govtBengal dy speaker assaults apartment resident
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Kolkata, December 11, 2014

Deputy Speaker of West Bengal assembly and Trinamool leader Sonali Guha was caught on camera threatening and manhandling the president of an apartment's residents' association in Howrah.
This incident come days after another Trinamool leader, Abu Ayesh Mondal, beat up a toll plaza employee after being asked to pay toll.
Guha is seen calling herself "the chief minister" and "the government" while threatening Dr Nagender Rai of evicting him from his flat and locking it up over a non-functional elevator of the building.
The incident happened early on Thursday morning.
"I'm the chief minister. I'm the government. Don't forget it," Guha is heard saying while threatening residents of the apartment with dire consequences.
"Don't speak too much or I will lock up your flat from outside tomorrow. No one will be able to open the lock," she is also heard saying in the footage being aired on local television channels.
CCTV footage also showed a woman thrashing the doctor with slippers.
Guha said she had rushed to the apartment to settle a dispute involving a family that has a pregnant woman and wanted to use the lift at that time to take her to a hospital. According to the building association regulations, the lift does not operate after 11pm.
On Thursday, Guha asserted that as woman she had done the right thing and went there as a Trinamool worker.
"I went there as a mother to save another would-be mother. I did nothing wrong. I only said the person was going too far," said Guha.
She alleged Rai and his family were BJP supporters and were trying to make a political issue out of it.
"I am not a deputy speaker 24x7. I'm a human being when I'm not a deputy speaker. I went there to solve a crisis created by some BJP men," she added.
She also claimed the family of the doctor had unleashed a reign of terror in the apartment.
Asked whether her action would embarrass her party and her leader, Guha said, "No. The chief minister asked me to keep calm and quiet while appointing me as the deputy speaker. I have done exactly the same over the past three years."
Guha, an old aide of chief minister Mamata Banerjee, has a reputation of abusing political opponents and government officials, even to the
extent of slapping people. She once called a police officer a swine after barging into the police station and locking up another.
Rai's family has lodged a complaint at Golabari police station.

Spectrum auction: Defence to give up airwaves06:00 pm
In a major boost for telecom companies ahead of the spectrum auction, the Defence Ministry has agreed to vacate some spectrum from the 2,100 Mhz band. Sources say the Department of Telecom has also finalised the reserve price for the upcoming auctions, reports CNBC-TV18’s Malvika Jain.
According to sources, DoT and Defence Ministry have agreed that the latter will vacate 5 lots in the 2100 MHz category. This effectively means more spectrum will be available to bid for. 3G auction will be held simultaneously with 2G in the upcoming auctions in February.
Additionally, Defence and DoT are also in talks with each other to swap spectrum in the 2100 MHz category, which is going to be around 15 MHz of spectrum. Now if more spectrum is made available, then the concerns raised by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), and other telecom companies like Bharti Airtel , Vodafone, Idea Cellular  and Reliance Communications  about artificial scarcity of spectrum being created to inflate prices could be addressed. The decision as far as spectrum pricing, its reserve price and also the availability of spectrum will be sent to the Cabinet for approval shortly.

Futures up as oil bounces ahead of economic dataWall St. lower but finishes year with solid gains

U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as crude oil prices continued their descent, but the S&P closed out a third straight year of double-digit gains.
For the year, the Dow ended up 7.5 percent, notching its sixth straight annual gain, and the Nasdaq rose 13.4 percent. The best-performing S&P component in 2014 was Southwest Airlines Co  up 124.6 percent, while Transocean Ltd , down 62.9 percent, was the worst.

Equities lost steam heading into the New Year after rallying nearly 6 percent over eight sessions, sparked by the U.S. Federal Reserve's commitment to be "patient" about raising interest rates and positive economic data.
Still, the S&P 500 has risen in seven of the past ten sessions, hitting a series of intraday and closing records, and finished the year up 11.4 percent. The stock market will be closed Thursday.
"The fact of the matter is markets put in a solid year in spite of significant headwinds that could have easily derailed a multi-year bull market," said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.

"The most the bears got out of this year was a 10 percent correction on an intraday basis and the markets stubbornly moved higher, and for good foundational reasons."
Gains may be tougher to come by next year, and a pick-up in profits growth may be essential if the market is to continue to add to its historic gains.
Action in the energy space was once again a focus for investors. U.S. crude oil  settled down 85 cents at $53.27 a barrel, its lowest since May 2009. Brent  settled down 57 cents to $57.33.
The S&P Energy index <.SPNY>, easily the worst performing sector of the year with a decline of 10 percent, lost 0.8 percent Wednesday. Diamond Offshore  fell 3.6 percent to $36.71 and Noble Corp  fell 2.8 percent to $16.57.
The CBOE volatility index <.VIX>, which measures the cost of protection against a drop on the S&P 500, surged 20.4 percent, its biggest jump since Dec. 10 and the fourth straight climb. Quarterly options on the S&P 500 expire at the end of the month.
"Part of it may be the quarterly expiration of S&P options but a lot of it has to do with crude being down today," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at retail brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.
Traders might be also looking to load up on some protection before they head out for the holiday, Kinahan said.
"We had such a nice year that many people may be looking to buy some protection for a 'just-in-case scenario' for between now and the new year," Kinahan said.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 160 points, or 0.89 percent, to 17,823.07, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 21.45 points, or 1.03 percent, to 2,058.9 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 41.39 points, or 0.87 percent, to 4,736.05.
Volume was light, with about 5.21 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.95 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

India ranks eighth in UKs top 10 foreign criminals listBy: Press Trust of India | London |
Posted: December 11, 2014 7:06 pm
India features at eighth position in in the UK’s assessment of foreign criminals living in the country while Pakistan holds the fifth place, according to a report.
The number of Indian nationals within the British prison system has also been on a slight increase over the last few years with the number registered as 423 in 2013-14, up from 408 in 2012-13, the UK’s National Audit Office (NAO) has said.
The dubious list is headed by Poland with 898 inmates, followed by the Irish Republic with 778 and Jamaica with 711.
Pakistan comes in at fifth place with 522, up from 466 in 2012-13.
“The government’s progress in managing and removing foreign national offenders (FNOs) since 2006 has been slower than we would expect, particularly given the increased resources and effort dedicated to this,” the NAO said in its report titled ‘Managing and Removing Foreign National Offenders’.
“This is reflected in the numbers as the FNO population in prison has increased slightly and while removals are now increasing this is largely due to a change of approach in 2013,” it added.
The annual cost of keeping these offenders in prison or immigration removal centres has been assessed at more than £250 million a year.
Among 1,859 of the most serious foreign offenders are 775 murderers, 587 rapists and a further 155 convicted of raping a minor.
Other serious crimes included 200 sex offences against children, 99 cases of manslaughter and 15 terror offences.
Only an average of 40 prisoners a year are sent home to serve their sentences, according to the report.
Britain’s senior-most Indian-origin MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of the home affairs select committee, said, “These are astonishing figures. Many of the countries concerned are either European Union countries or countries with whom we enjoy good relations”.
“The taxpayer is picking up the bill for those who have committed some of the most serious crime imaginable. There is a lack of focus and determination on the part of the Home Office to rid our country of these criminals,” Vaz said.
Separate figures from the Home Office said 4,200 of the 11,000 foreign offenders are living in the community, including those convicted of 16 murders, 56 rapes and hundreds of robberies and violent attacks.

Q: Aren’t falling oil prices good for the market?
A: Oil prices are collapsing. Consumers are pouring less of their money into their gas tanks. That should be good for the economy and stocks, right?
Not exactly. The stock market is strugging this month as the decline in oil prices intensifies. There are several reasons for this. First is the direct hit. Lower gasoline prices result in lower prices of shares of energy stocks, which are a big contributor to the markets. Exxon Mobil (XOM) is the fourth most valuable company in the Standard & Poor’s 500 so when its shares tumble, that hurts the broad market. Shares of Exxon are down more than 12% this year, creating a big downward draft for the other companies to overcome. The S&P SmallCap 600 Energy index is down a crushing 50% from its level back in June, says Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. But it’s not just a speculator and stock-trader event. Analysts have been slashing their earnings forecasts for just about every energy company. Lower energy prices are a problem for nearly all energy companies with the exploration companies getting hit the worst. And that’s a problem. During the third quarter, the energy sector generated about a third of of the S&P 500’s total earnings of $30.03 share, says S&P Capital IQ.

November retail sales up 0.7%november retail sales up 0.7%
U.S. jobless claims fall; continuing claims up80
The U.S. central bank, which has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008, lowered its unemployment rate forecast on Wednesday. Many economists expect the first rate hike in mid-2015.
In a second report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 24.5 this month from a reading of 40.8 in November. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing sector.
Economists said November's jump in the index had grossly exaggerated the strength of manufacturing. They said this month's sharp deceleration brought it in line with other factory indicators.
“We suspect that the slump was also mostly noise rather than any signal that, in this case, the global slowdown is suddenly undermining U.S. manufacturing,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
U.S. stocks were trading higher on the data and also were supported by signs that oil prices were stabilizing. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.
Last week's data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for December's nonfarm payrolls.
The four-week average of claims rose between the November and December survey periods, suggesting a step back in job growth after payrolls surged by 321,000 last month. The December payrolls are still expected to come in above 200,000.
Job gains have exceeded 200,000 for 10 straight months, the longest such stretch since 1994.
In another report, financial data firm Markit said its “flash” services Purchasing Managers Index fell to 53.6 in December, the lowest reading since February, from 56.2 in November. A reading above 50 signals expansion in the services sector.
The survey, however, is not regarded as a reliable indicator of services sector activity because of its short history.

In Arizona  swings in Medicaid access show program s...When tax revenues plunged during the 2008-09 recession, however, Arizona froze Medicaid enrollment for childless adults and dropped services. The retrenchment was one of the most severe in the country.
Doctors and others quickly noticed changes.
At Dr. J. Manuel Arreguin's gynecology clinic on the lower-income south side of Tucson, women began delaying recommended surgery for fibroids, noncancerous growths that appear in the uterus and can cause serious bleeding.
Pima County jail officials noticed that more inmates needed extra medical attention, even kidney dialysis. Many had lost health insurance and access to medications and medical services before they were arrested.
In rural health clinics, patients started drifting away; many sought care or drugs in Mexico, said Amanda Aguirre, president of the Regional Center for Border Health.
And at Tucson Medical Center, doctors and nurses struggled to get patients to seek follow-up care.
If it was just a couple of months earlier, we probably could have stopped some of these problems. We're constantly shaking our heads. - Dr. David Armstrong, University of Arizona Medical Center
"It seemed like all of a sudden, half the people didn't have health coverage," said Dr. Michelle Williams, assistant medical director of the hospital's emergency department. "I didn't want to ask about coverage because it is not what I'm supposed to do as a physician. But you had to.
"I'd make a plan for a patient, and then they would say, 'That's not going to work because I don't have insurance.'"
Among the Medicaid services the state cut four years ago was podiatry, an important benefit for diabetics, many of whom lose feeling in their feet and become more prone to infections as the disease wastes nerves and arteries.
At the University of Arizona Medical Center in Tucson, Dr. David Armstrong still sees the impact.
Nearly every day, Armstrong and Dr. Joseph L. Mills, who co-direct the Southern Arizona Limb Salvage Alliance, don surgical scrubs and step into an operating room to amputate limbs or cut away diseased bones and flesh of patients with diabetes who put off seeing a doctor.
One afternoon, Armstrong's team labored to save the black, gangrenous left foot of a 30-year-old diabetic, sawing out infected bones, stitching healthy tissue and grafting skin in a bid to spare him life in a wheelchair.
"If it was just a couple of months earlier, we probably could have stopped some of these problems," Armstrong said later. "We're constantly shaking our heads."
Armstrong and other researchers documented a 37% increase in hospital admissions for diabetic foot ulcers between 2006 and 2011, according to a study they published in the journal Diabetes Care.
Patients also stayed longer in the hospital with more severe outcomes, they found. Amputations, surgical complications, life-threatening infections and deaths increased by nearly half.
"These people's feet were literally killing them," Armstrong said.
What's frustrating, he said, is that the solution is straightforward. "It doesn't need big, fancy machines.... It's just good, quality primary care."
Sitting in her living room in a modest apartment complex in Tucson, Slone counts herself lucky that her injury wasn't worse.
She can walk. And she got a new job at a call center this summer, which soon should give her health insurance again.
She is still struggling with more than $30,000 in medical bills, however, and has had a new flare-up on her foot.
Many other Arizonans have gained coverage since January after Republican Gov. Jan Brewer's push for Medicaid expansion. Enrollment surged 26% this year to more than 1.6 million, state figures show.
Although podiatry services haven't been restored, the expansion of the safety net is already being felt.
At Tucson Medical Center, the number of life-threatening cases in the emergency room has declined.
Doctors instead are seeing more patients with severe headaches or abdominal pain. The symptoms can indicate a very serious condition, but uninsured patients often ignore them, fearing the high bills they may face.
At the hospital's breast clinic, the waiting list for screening through the hospital's charity program, which had been three months, is now half as long.
Officials at the Pima County jail have been busily signing up inmates for Medicaid all year. Capt. India Davis, the assistant corrections director, said officials expect the improved access to healthcare, especially behavioral health services, will not only lessen the burden on the lockup but also reduce recidivism.
But the state's swings in policy may not be over.
A group of GOP state lawmakers is suing to roll back the Medicaid expansion.
And Gov.-elect Doug Ducey, a Republican who will succeed Brewer in January, hasn't specified whether he will maintain the new safety net coverage.

Zuari group firms to reclassifysharesStreet sees good show after stellar year
Saroj Poddar-led Adventz Group’s Zuari Agro Chemicals and Zuari Global on Tuesday said four companies namely SIL Investmemts, RTM Investment and Trading Company, SCM Investment and Trading Company and Ronson Traders have ceased to be the promoters of them with immediate effect.
These four companies have decided to obtain reclassification of shares they held in both Zuari Agro Chemicals and Zuari global from “promoter category” to “public category”, the two Zuari group firms said in separate BSE filings.
The four companies collectively owned 8.12% in Zuari Agro Chemical and now after the reclassification their shares may be considered as a part of the free-float. The reason for reclassification was, however, not mentioned in the filings. As the four companies ceased to be the promoters of Zuari Agro Chemicals and Zuari Global, public shareholdings of both the companies have increased from the earlier levels.
For Zuari Agro Chemicals its public shareholding now increased to 34.71%. As on September 30, 2014 it stood at 26.59%.
Interestingly, Zuari Agro Chemicals was person acting in concert (PAC) with Zuari Fertlisers and Chemicals, the acquirer, for the recently launched fresh open offer by Poddar for an additional 25.90% equity of Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilisers (MCF).
The four companies, SIL Investmemts, RTM Investment, SCM Investment and Ronson Traders, were mentioned as the PAC of Zuari Agro for the open offer.

Essar Group  Rosneft to Sign 10-Year Oil Deal: ReportTata Motors Sales Rise 10% in December
New Delhi: Essar Group will sign a long-term crude oil import deal with Russia's Rosneft during President Vladimir Putin's visit to New Delhi on Thursday, government and industry sources said on Wednesday.
"Essar will sign a MoU (memorandum of understanding) with them (Rosneft)," two Indian government sources said. "The deal will be for 10 years," an industry source familiar with the matter said.
Essar Group operates the 405,000 barrels per day (bpd) Vadinar refinery in the western state of Gujarat and also the 296,000 bpd Stanlow refinery in northwest England which is operating at below its capacity.
Volumes, pricing and other details of the deal with state-controlled Rosneft, the world's largest listed oil firm by output, were not immediately known. Essar depends heavily on Iran to feed its Vadinar refinery.
In January, sources told Reuters that Russia and Iran were negotiating an oil-for-goods swap deal.
Russian Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev was quoted on November 30 as saying the deal with Iran might be sealed soon. Iran Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh on Wednesday said there was no such plan in prospect.
Russia, isolated by the West over its annexation of Crimea and role in the Ukraine crisis, has a close relationship with India that dates back to the Soviet era.
India and Russia are expected to issue a joint statement aimed at strengthening the energy partnership between the two countries.
State-run explorer Oil India Ltd will also sign an initial deal with Russia's state-owned Zarubezhneft to cooperate in the hydrocarbons sector, sources said.
Oil India will explore hiring the Moscow-based firm's drilling vessel Deep Venture and seek Zarubezhneft's help in extracting heavy oil from the Indian firm's Rajasthan block.
An Essar spokesman declined to comment. Oil India chairman S K Srivastava declined comment. Rosneft could not be immediately reached for comment.

Brave tech company tests IPO watersBrave tech company tests IPO waters

Source: LendingClub prospectus
LendingClub, somewhat of a eBay of loans to connect borrowers and lenders, braved the choppy market Wednesday to sell shares of the first time.
The company raised $866 million by selling 57.7 million shares at $15 a share. That was a successful reception since it had planned to raise upwards of $750 million by selling 57.7 million shares for between $12 and $14 a share.
By raising $866 million, the company is fourth largest technology deal of the year, says John Fitzgibbon of IPOScoop.com. LendingClub’s proceeds area fraction of the $21.8 billion raised by Chinese Internet company Alibaba (BABA) . LendingClub also trails medical tech company IMS Health (IMS) at $1.3 billion and mobile tech firm Mobileye (MBLY) at $889 million, Fitzgibbon says.
“It’s one of the larger ones (tech IPOs of the year), but not all that noteworthy,” Fitzgibbon says.
Demand for the shares, expected to trade Thursday, appears strong.
Technology companies have been an important part of the initial public offering market’s rebound. The industry has raised $30.8 billion from offerings over the past 12 months, the largest of any industry, says Renaissance Capital. In terms of number of deals, 49 tech companies have launched IPOs the past 12 months, just behind the No. 1 source of offerings, health care, with 100.
There’s strong demand for LendingClub stock, says Linda Killian of Renaissance Capital, which manages the IPO exchange traded fund that trades by the symbol IPO. The company has emerged with a strong brand name in what could be a growing area of microlending, she says. The key will be if the company can go beyond being just a source of loans for consumers to consolidate credit card debt. LendingClub is making a push to be a source of loans for small business, she says.
“The big issue is how successful entering in the small business loan business,” she says.

Marine miracle: Sailor lost at sea for 12 days rescued off coast of HawaiiBy Elahe Izadi December 10, 2014 Follow @ElaheIzadi

The Coast Guard had called off the search nine days earlier.
The missing boater’s friends had planned his memorial service.
Then, on Tuesday, the unbelievable happened in the waters off the Hawaiian island of Oahu: Ron Ingraham was found alive — and adrift — in  his 25-foot sailboat .
It was Thanksgiving Day when Ingraham set sail from his home on Molokai to Lanai, according to Hawaii News Now . It was a routine trip for the experienced 67-year-old sailor,  CNN reported .
But his boat, Malia, began taking on water, and Ingraham made a distress call for help, saying his vessel was in danger of sinking,  according to the Coast Guard .
That initial distress call and a second one later in the day prompted a massive search that involved helicopters and planes and covered 12,000 square miles. But nothing turned up.
A few days later, on Dec. 1, the Coast Guard called off the search.
“When the commanding officer for the Coast Guard told me he was going to call off the search, I said, ‘Man, I don’t think you should call off the search because I don’t think he’s gone,’ ” Ingraham’s son Zakary  told Hawaii News Now .
Still, the suspension of the search seemed to signal the inevitable, and Ingraham’s friends began preparations for a memorial service. It was scheduled for this coming Saturday, they told KITV .
But 12 days after Ingraham dropped off the map, another distress call came through.
“We got a mayday here. Mayday. This is the Malia,” Ingraham was heard saying  Tuesday morning. “Anybody picking this up?”
The Coast Guard heard the call, which was made 64 miles south of Honolulu. The USS Paul Hamilton, a guided-missile destroyer, was just 14 miles away from Ingraham at the time, according to the Coast Guard. About an hour after his call for help, the Navy ship reported that Ingraham was “weak, hungry and dehydrated.” But he was alive, and without injuries .

Zakary Ingraham told CNN that his father fishes for a living and lives aboard the boat. The younger Ingraham said his father told rescuers: “We ain’t leaving without my boat.”
Ingraham was brought back to Molokai on Wednesday, along with his boat.
Coast Guard Lt. Scott Carr told KITV that finding a person after a search has ended almost never happens. “I’ve been in 21 years, and there’s maybe a handful of times where we found somebody after we suspended.”
Following his rescue, Ingraham told ABC News that he was knocked into the water when a rogue wave hit his boat. “But I had a rope so I towed myself in,” he told the network. He also told ABC that he’d survived on fish.
“I’m a fisherman so I caught fish; it wasn’t as good as a sushi bar, but that’s how I hydrated,” he said, according to ABC.
Ingraham’s son told CNN that after four days of searching the rough Pacific waters, officials thought the boat had sunk. He was relieved that his gut feeling — that his resourceful, tough-as-nails father was still alive — was right. “He’s alive after 12 days at sea,” Zakary Ingraham said. “I couldn’t be happier.”
Zakary Ingraham, who lives in Missouri, has been estranged from his father, not having him seen him since the 1990s, the Associated Press reported . His father’s disappearance prompted deep remorse for him, especially since his 8-year-old son has never met the elder Ingraham.
“We didn’t really have a falling out,” Zakary Ingraham told the AP. “We just kind of grew apart.” Since finding out his father had disappeared, he’s reached out to local fisherman on Molokai to learn more about Ron Ingraham, the man without a known email address or phone number.
But now that his father has been found, Zakary Ingraham said he would try to take out a loan so he can afford the pricey trip back to Hawaii, where he lived until he was 7 and his parents divorced.
“When I see my dad, I’m going to give him a big hug,” he told AP. “I’m going to do everything I can to get out there as soon as possible.”
And that memorial service for Ron Ingraham scheduled for Saturday?
It will be a celebration instead.
“I thought I was going to die,” he told ABC . “I hung in there. It took mental discipline. But these guys are real heroes and they save people’s lives. I owe it all to them.”

Carl s Jr. Targets Millennials With  Natural Burgerreddit
Carl's Jr. will introduce what it says is the first "all-natural, no hormones, no antibiotics, no steroids, grass-fed, free-range beef patty" from any major quick-service chain. The item also is the latest effort by a QSR chain to reach out to the 18-to-34-year-old millennial age group, some of whom are choosing fast-casual chains such as Smashburger, Elevation Burger and The Counter, perceiving these chains' food to be higher quality.
The All-Natural Burger, available Dec. 17, tops the char-broiled beef patty with Cheddar cheese, "vine ripened" tomato, red onion, lettuce, bread-and butter pickles, ketchup, mustard and mayo on a baked-in-house bun. The new burger is priced a la carte at $4.69, or $6.99 for a double. Carl's Jr. says customers will be able to request the Natural patty on any burger on the menu for an additional charge.
"We've seen a growing demand for 'cleaner,' more natural food, particularly among millennials, and we're proud to be the first major fast-food chain to offer an all-natural beef patty burger on our menu. Millennials include our target of 'Young Hungry Guys' and they are much more concerned about what goes into their bodies than previous generations," Brad Haley, chief marketing officer for Carl's Jr., said in a statement announcing the new burger. "Whether you're into more natural foods or not, it's simply a damn good burger."
McDonald's this week announced plans to expand availability of its "Create Your Taste" customization option for Quarter Pounders. That program also is seen as a way to appeal to millennials. But as reported here earlier, NPD Group data shows that millennials' visits to QSRs have declined over the past five years but 25-to-34-year-olds still make 171 annual QSR visits, compared with 11 fast-casual visits.
Broadcast advertising from agency 72andSunny breaks Dec. 29. The chain says it will air an additional spot during the Feb. 1, 2015, Super Bowl.

Is rider safety the real Achilles heel for cab companies like UberRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
The growth of ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft so far has not been hindered by limits from government regulators and campaigns by taxi cab competitors. A bigger threat to the new industry’s impressive start could come from customers – if enough people stop using the services over fears that drivers aren’t safe.
Not safe as in the drivers won’t get into an accident – safe as in they won’t attack passengers.
Uber operates in more than 250 cities in 50 countries, and recently was valued at $40 billion based on $1.2 billion that investors poured into the company in its latest funding round. Lyft, meanwhile, operates in 70 markets in the U.S., up from 30 at the start of the year.
So far, controversies have not seemed impact the popularity of ride-hailing apps. They boast several advantages over taxis, including no-cash payments and an app that shows how far away a car is and whether the driver received positive reviews from prior riders. Uber ranks 39th in the Apple iTunes store among the most popular free apps, ahead of Gmail and the music streaming service Pandora. Lyft, which is much smaller, is not in the top 100.
But just this week, California prosecutors sued both, saying they misrepresent and exaggerate the rigor of their background checks. Police in India questioned an Uber executive about its background checks after a driver was accused of raping a passenger. And Uber removed a driver in Chicago after a customer reported she was sexually assaulted during a ride in the city last month. The company said it is cooperating with police in what it called “an appalling and unacceptable incident.
This week’s incidents follow scattered anecdotes of previous assaults by Uber drivers. They don’t prove the services are unsafe alternatives to traditional taxis. But they do present a challenge if riders begin to think they reflect a systemic disregard for passenger safety.
Jeff Brewer, pastor at a church in the Chicago suburbs, wouldn’t step into an Uber car. Though he likes the convenience Uber would bring, he sticks with taxis on trips into the city.
“Whether it’s right or wrong, there’s at least some sort of perception that there’s a company that has vetted the person,” he said.
As with airlines, if passenger safety becomes an ongoing issue with Uber rather than isolated incidents, it could face long-term consequences, said Alex Stanton, a crisis management and communications specialist.
“At some level, there is a point at which safety does trump convenience,” Stanton said.
“On its website, Uber says its drivers are “screened through a rigorous process we’ve developed using constantly improving standards.” In a written statement, Uber added that it screens would-be drivers against “federal, multi-state and county criminal background checks spanning the past seven years.” The company expects to complete more than 2 million checks this year, according to spokesman Lane Kasselman.
But California prosecutors, who filed lawsuits against Uber in San Francisco Superior Court, say the company’s safety checks are not as rigorous as they sound. Unlike with regulated taxis in San Francisco and Los Angeles, Uber’s background checks do not require drivers be fingerprinted.
Hirease, the company that performs Uber’s background checks, instead relies on “personal identifiers,” such as license numbers and Social Security numbers are supplied by the applicants. As such, the lawsuit says, there is no way to ensure that the applicants are who they say they are.
As part of a settlement of a similar lawsuit, Uber rival Lyft agreed to drop claims that its background checks are the “best available” and the “gold standard.”
Cab drivers have seized on the safety issue, saying that taxi drivers have to pass government-standard checks which cost more but do a better job screening out bad applicants. The Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association has launched a “Who’s Driving You?” campaign targeting Uber and Lyft.
“Once consumers realize Uber and Lyft are cutting costs, they’ll begin to shy away,” said Dave Sutton, an association spokesman.

India Likely to Improve Economic Growth to 6.3% in 2016: United NationsArun Jaitley Resolves to Encourage Public, Private Investment in 2015
India's economic growth is expected to improve to 6.3 per cent in 2016 with the country leading economic recovery in South Asia, according to a United Nations report.
The UN World Economic Situation and Prospects 2015 (WESP) report, launched on Wednesday also said India is likely to make progress in implementing economic policy reforms and help provide support to business and consumer confidence.
It said global economic growth is forecast to continue increasing over the next two years, despite legacies from the financial crisis continuing to weigh on growth, and the emergence of new challenges, including geopolitical conflicts such as in Ukraine, and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
The global economy is expected to grow 3.1 per cent in 2015 and 3.3 per cent in 2016, compared with an estimated growth of 2.6 per cent for 2014, when the pace of expansion has been moderate and uneven.
It said India, which is estimated to record a 5.4 per cent economic growth in 2014, will see GDP growth improving to 5.9 per cent next year and 6.3 per cent in 2016.
Economic growth in South Asia is also set to gradually pick up from an estimated 4.9 per cent in 2014 to 5.4 per cent in 2015 and 5.7 per cent in 2016.
"While the recovery will be led by India, which accounts for about 70 per cent of regional output, other economies such as Bangladesh and Iran are also projected to see stronger growth in the forecast period," the report said.
The about six per cent growth projected for India in 2016 will be the highest since the 2008-2011 period when it had grown at about 7.3 per cent.
Economic growth had slowed to 4.7 per cent in 2012, according to the UN report. During 2014, East Asia, including China, managed to register relatively robust growth, while India led South Asia to a moderate strengthening.
Developing countries as a group are expected to grow at 4.8 per cent in 2015 and 5.1 per cent in 2016, up from the 4.3 per cent estimated for 2014.
The report added that along with robust external demand, growth is expected to be underpinned by a moderate strengthening of domestic consumption and investment as countries benefit from improved macroeconomic conditions.
"Several countries, notably India, are likely to make progress in implementing economic policy reforms, thus providing support to business and consumer confidence," it said.

Narendra Modi to Vladimir Putin: Russia to stay India s top defence partnerIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
Prime Minister Narendra Modi told President Vladimir Putin on Thursday that Russia will remain India’s top defence supplier, even though New Delhi’s options had improved since the end of the Cold War.
Modi spoke after a one-day summit that sought to revive a relationship that peaked in the Soviet era, while the two sides signed billions of dollars in deals covering nuclear power, oil and defence cooperation.
In the most significant ones, state-owned Rosatom will build 12 nuclear reactors in India, energy major Rosneft  inked a 10-year crude supply deal with Essar Oil and Russia promised to build advanced helicopters in India.
“Even if India’s options have increased, Russia remains our most important defence partner,” Modi, 64, told reporters after the first formal summit between the leaders since Modi won election by a landslide in May.
Putin’s visit comes as the Kremlin grapples with a sliding oil price and weak economy that have deepened the impact of Western sanctions over its annexation of Crimea last spring and support for an uprising in eastern Ukraine.
The tension over Ukraine intruded on the choreographed visit when it emerged that the Russian-backed leader of Crimea had travelled as part of Putin’s delegation for what were billed as unofficial talks to enhance trade.
“We highly appreciate the friendship, trust and mutual understanding with Indian partners,” said Putin who touched on bilateral issues chiefly in his statement to journalists. No questions were allowed.
VISION
The two leaders presided over the signing of a “vision” document setting out a roadmap for cooperation in the sphere of nuclear power. Putin said Russia could eventually supply India with 20 nuclear reactors.
In the event, state-owned Rosatom said that under an agreement signed on Thursday it would supply 12 nuclear energy reactors for India over 20 years.
A 1,000-megawatt reactor is operating at the Russian-built Kudankulam power station in south India, with a second due  onstream in 2015.
Indian officials say a total of six reactors will be built at Kudankulam, with a further six to follow at a site that has not yet been determined.
Other strategic deals covered oil supply, infrastructure and an increase in direct diamond sales to India by Russian state monopoly Alrosa.
On defence, the two sides will seek to move ahead with long-delayed projects to develop a joint fifth-generation fighter jet and a multi-role transport aircraft, in addition to the advanced helicopter cited by Modi.
CRIMEAN COMMOTION
A spokesman for India’s foreign minister said he was not officially aware of Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov’s visit.
But Gul Kripalani, a Mumbai businessman who met the Crimean leader at a New Delhi hotel, told Reuters the talks were unofficial and Aksyonov had travelled to India as part of Putin’s delegation.
Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia over the annexation of Crimea in February and the Kremlin’s support for an uprising by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.
HIGHLIGHTS
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin got straight down to talks on Thursday on boosting nuclear and defence cooperation at a summit aimed at reviving an old friendship that has faded over the years.
Putin’s one-day visit to India, at which a raft of agreements were signed, comes at a time when Russia is at odds with the West over Ukraine, and its economy is stalling as oil prices tumble to their lowest in five years.
Here are some of the key announcements:
ENERGY
* Russia’s state-owned Rosatom will supply 12 nuclear energy reactors to India over 20 years, under an agreement aimed at boosting nuclear energy ties between the two countries.
* India’s Essar Group signed a deal with Russian oil producer Rosneft to import oil.
* Russian bank VTB will open a $1 billion credit line to Essar Group, chief executive Andrei Kostin said.
* The Russian Direct Investment Fund will team up with an Indian infrastructure financing company, IDFC, to invest $1 billion in hydroelectric projects in Asia’s third-largest economy.
* India’s Tata Power signed a pact with the Russian Direct Investment Fund to increase energy investment between the two countries.
DEFENCE
* Russia, which is India’s top defence supplier, offers to manufacture an advanced helicopter in India.
MINING
* India’s top iron ore miner NMDC signed a memorandum of understanding with Akron to buy a stake in a potash mine in Russia.

Pentagon Marine Service plans ship maintenance hub in Gujarat

(Pentagon Marine Services…)
AHMEDABAD: Mumbai-based Pentagon Marine Services today said it plans to develop a ship maintenance and repairing hub in Gujarat to come up by 2018 with an initial investment of Rs 50 crore.
"Gujarat has ship building and breaking yards, but between that it misses the link of ship maintenance and repair," Pentagon Marine Services chairman and managing director Captain Nalin Pandey told mediapersons here.
"The state has a 1600-km coastline with 48 ports, even though it lacks skilled labour in ship-repairing. To fill that gap, we are planning to develop a shipping hub in Gujarat to provide repairing and maintenance facilities," Pandey said.
Pandey said they have tied up with a Singapore-based company for technical assistance to set up the hub in Gujarat, which will provide maintenance and repair facilities to around 50 to 60 ships annually.
"We will identify the place to develop the shipping hub by March 2015. For that we are in consultation with Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB)," Pandey said adding that the hub is likely to be operationalised by 2018.
The company will also provide a maritime training course to labourers working at various state ports, he said.
Pentagon Marine Services was established in Mumbai in 2004. It offers services in ship and crew management along with the repair and inspection of ships, a company statement said.

Maa Mahamaya plans to double capacity
Our Bureau
Tweet
Visakhapatnam, Dec 11:  
Maa Mahamaya Industries Ltd, the first mini integrated steel plant in Andhra Pradesh set up in Vizianagaram district, is planning to double its present capacity of 1.20 lakh tonnes per annum, according to N. Rath, the president.
He was speaking at a press meet here on Thursday after releasing the new product of the company - the premium double-ribbed TMT steel bar named "Mangal 999". He said the mini integrated steel plant had been set up at R.G Peta village in the L. Kota mandal of Vizianagaram district in 2006 at a cost of Rs 270 crore. “We are now launching the premium variant of our main product - Mangal 999 - which provides greater grip and the bond between the concrete and steel is enhanced manifold, if these TMT bars are used. The price variation may be 10-15 per cent for the premium, but we are sure the market will accept it," he said.
He said the market conditions in the recent past had not been very encouraging, and that was the reason why the expansion had been put on hold but "we will go ahead with it in the near future. We will have to invest Rs 700-800 crore for the purpose."
Ashok Kumar Agarwal, Chairman and Managing Director of the company, said there were only two factories in the country - one in the north and the other in Karnataka - producing a similar product and the company would have no problem in selling it. "At present, we are focussing only on AP and Telangana. After expansion, we will branch out to the other southern states and northen markets as well," he said.
He said the company had tied up with the NMDC for sourcing the iron ore from Chhattisgarh. In response to a question, he said the company had suffered losses of Rs 40 crore due to Hudhud cyclone and lost 20 days or so of production. "The cyclone was a definite setback this year, but now we are back to normal," he added.

Ethanol pricing sweetens outlook for sugar sectorEthanol pricing sweetens outlook for sugar sector
Shishir Asthana | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 05:24 PM IST
Sugar stocks are euphoric and so are the promoters of sugar companies after the government announced a surprise shift in pricing mechanism for the ethanol industry. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) fixed the delivered price of ethanol in the range of Rs 48.50-Rs 49.50 per litre. 
The price will vary with the distance of sugar mill from the depot/installation of the public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs). For distances ranging from 0-100 kms, the price has been fixed at Rs 48.50 per litre. An extra 50 paise will be charged if the distance is 101-300 kms while the upper end of the band will apply to distances more than 300 kms.
Oil firms presently pay about Rs 29 per litre for ethanol but the ex-sugar mill price of ethanol is around Rs 42.02 per litre. As far as sugar mills are concerned it is profitable to sell ethanol for industrial usage or for distilleries rather than selling it as a fuel to oil marketing companies.
Because of the politics involved at every stage of sugar production, sugarcane prices were increased to please the farmers, but there was no proportionate increase in the selling price of ethanol. 
Ethanol blended petrol (EBP) programme was launched in 2003 and was later expanded in 2006. OMCs were directed to sell 5 per cent EBP subject to commercial viability. A National Policy on Bio-fuels was also notified by the government in 2009 to ensure that a minimum level of bio-fuels is readily available to meet demand at any given time.
However, the program has not extended beyond certain centres because of supply and pricing issues. The procurement price of ethanol was earlier supposed to be decided by oil companies and the suppliers of ethanol, but oil companies insisted on procuring the fuel at the earlier notified price of Rs 29 per litre.
Ethanol at Rs 48.50 per litre at the OMCs depot would be a big plus for sugar companies. Segment-wise numbers of most of the sugar companies show that they have been making steady profit by selling ethanol rather than selling sugar. 
Take the case of Balrampur Chini which has sales of Rs 2,186.31 crore from sugar in FY14 while its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) reported a loss of Rs 108.49 crore. In comparison the distillery business, which is basically sale of alcohol, had revenue of Rs 251.74 crore and an EBIT of Rs 116.22 crore. Sugar profits have been cyclical over the years but those from ethanol sales have been steady and high.
While sugar companies will be profitable from the government policy, oil companies too are benefiting by blending ethanol with their fuel. Minister of Transport and Highways and Shipping Nitin Gadkari has been a strong proponent of use of ethanol as a fuel. In a recent statement he said [LINK 1] that he has asked his department to study whether the five big companies Volkswagen, Ford, Toyota, Honda and Fiat can import E85 engines which use a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% petrol. Presently, only 10% of ethanol is being blended with 90% petrol.
According to Gadkari, the Rs 6 lakh fuel import bill of the country can be reduced by Rs 2 lakh crore by using alternative fuels. Gadkari, said that his government is in talks with farmers in the presence of petroleum minister to explore the possibility of reviving sick sugar factories.
At a price of Rs 48 per litre, ethanol can revive most of the sick sugar companies which can be used to produce only fuel rather than sugar and generate power, as is the case in Brazil.

Defence may free only 25% of total 3G spectrum desired by DoT

3G spectrum
(The Defence Ministry may…)
NEW DELHI: Defence Ministry has agreed to free some of its spectrum for use by mobile phone companies, a move that will boost upcoming auction of radiowaves.
The ministry has "in-principle" agreed to release 5 megahertz (MHz) in the 2,100 MHz band across in 17 out of 22 telecom services areas or circles, said a top source.
This is one-fourth of the quantity that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has been seeking.
The additional spectrum will be available by March or April, said the source.
"We expect 5 MHz in 2100 MHz band to be vacated by the Defence. The rest 15 Mhz, which is to be swapped with other bands, mainly 1900 Mhz, will also happen but it will take time," the source said.
The spectrum vacation will require the Cabinet approval, sources said, indicating that the government may go ahead with 3G auction with 5 Mhz in the next round to be held in February.
The Department of Telecom is in discussions with the Defence on the issue, they added.
In 2010, three blocks each having 5 Mhz frequency of 3G spectrum were auctioned across the country and fetched Rs 67,718.95 crore to the exchequer.
Defence had released 20 MHz out of 25 MHz in 2100 MHz band allocated to DoT under the agreement with Defence on a pan-India basis and one more block of 5 MHz in 5 circles, which was auctioned in 2010.
Under the agreement with DoT, the remaining spectrum is to be vacated only after the alternate communications network is completed.
The government plans to conduct 3G spectrum auction along with 2G radiowaves sale in February. It has asked telecom regulator Trai to expedite the base price recommendations for that.
The government is estimated to garner at least Rs 9,355 crore from sale of radiowaves in February. As per estimates, auction of spectrum in 2100 Mhz band in February can fetch bids worth at least Rs 5,000 crore.

Cos likely to tap debt markets abroad more: ...bond issuances
(With investment cycle likely…)
MUMBAI: With investment cycle likely to pick up soon, Indian corporates may increasingly tap overseas debt markets to meet their funding requirement, says a report.
"We expect Indian corporates to increasingly access the offshore debt capital markets for their funding requirements. The growth is likely to be driven by the need to refinance debt and fund capex once the investment cycle restarts," Fitch Ratings said.
It said the number of new issuers will also increase as many of the corporates are looking to diversify their funding sources.
The report said the offshore capital markets are becoming increasingly attractive to corporates partly because of better pricing for their bonds.
"The offshore markets now present a relatively more cost-effective funding source compared with onshore funding for Indian corporates that have material cash inflows denominated in foreign currency," the international rating agency said.
Pricing of offshore bonds has also been aided by a reduction of withholding tax on interest payments of offshore bonds to 5 per cent from July 2014 compared with 20 per cent previously.
The demand for domestic bonds has also been strong due to expectations of improvement in the country's economic growth, improved political stability and strong liquidity in global capital markets, the report said.
As per Fitch, offshore bond issuances by non-financial corporates have crossed USD 13 billion so far in 2014, compared with around USD 9 billion during entire 2013.
Issuances by non-investment grade (rated lower than 'BBB-') corporates have increased significantly to over USD 5 billion in 2014 from USD 3 billion last year.
The number of such corporates issuing bonds has also increased to over ten compared with four in 2013.
During 2014, the majority of the bond issuances by the non-investment grade corporates have been for refinancing. A few used it to fund expansion or overseas acquisitions, the report said.
The Reserve Bank has recently come out with a circular which limits the raising of debt by Indian corporates, either directly or indirectly, in the offshore markets at rates above the interest cap set out in the Foreign Exchange Management Act.
It also imposes restrictions on domestic entities providing guarantees to their overseas subsidiaries or holding companies for raising offshore debt.
The report said norms may limit issuances by Indian corporates rated at the lower end of 'BB' category or lower, which typically pay higher interest rates.
Fitch, however, expects the number of new issuers tapping the offshore bond market to grow despite the RBI's restrictions.

A post office in Kerala which  delivers  mails to GodDec 11, 2014 at 05:38pm IST
A post office in Kerala which 'delivers' mails to God

Sabarimala (Kerala): It is a unique post office, and one of its main tasks is to deliver letters to God. Located near the famed Hindu temple at the Sabarimala hills, the post office may perhaps be the only one in the country which does not work round the year. It comes alive when the peak pilgrimage season of the Ayyappa shrine begins on the first day of the Malayalam month in November, and the period ends towards the middle of January.
The post office is also open for 10 days during the Vishu season. Functioning six days a week from 8 in the morning to 8 at night, the six employees, led by 23-year-old Sai G Prakash, have a lot to do. Prakash is happy to be here, and says he was a devotee of Lord Ayyappa.
"Our post office mostly gets invitation cards for weddings and shop openings addressed to Lord Ayyappa, obviously to seek divine blessings," Prakash said.
The post office is also open for 10 days during the Vishu season. Functioning six days a week from 8 in the morning to 8 at night, the six employees, led by 23-year-old Sai G Prakash, have a lot to do.
#kerala #hindu temple #tamil nadu #karnataka
Most such mails come from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, he said. But the three letter boxes kept in the temple complex get more than post cards and envelopes. Every morning, the staff find scores of identity cards and wallets too in them.
"We make it a point to mail these cards to the individuals concerned," Prakash said. The employees often spend their own money to do this. "Since this season began, I have posted close to 20 PAN cards to the income tax office."
Police say all this is the work of pickpockets who operate in the temple town -- crowded during the pilgrimage season.  The criminals pocket the money from the wallets and dump the cards -- and wallets -- in the post boxes.
Situated in the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats at 914 metres above sea level, the Sabarimala temple is four kilometres uphill from Pamba in Pathanamthitta district, around 100 km from Thiruvananthapuram.
The temple is accessible only on foot from Pamba. During the last pilgrimage season, more than 4.5 million devotees visited the shrine. This season the authorities expect a 10 percent increase.
A feature of the post office is the special pictorial cancellation stamp of the 18 steps that led to the Lord Ayyappa shrine. "Some devotees come and buy covers or cards and write their own address and post them here," said Prakash. "This is their souvenir."
The post office helps pilgrims to post 'appom' and 'aravana' (the temple prasad). It also sells mobile recharge coupons.
Of the six employees, three walk down the hill daily carrying the outgoing mail on their heads. When they walk up, they carry bags of mail -- mostly addressed to Lord Ayyappa. "Overall we enjoy what we do here," said Prakash. "We are very happy we got this posting.

Rupee plunges 31 paise to end at 10-month lowForex update: Rupee plunges 31 paise to 10-month low of 62.33 against dollar
Neha Dasgupta     Mumbai   Last Updated: December 11, 2014  | 19:59 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The rupee on Thursday plunged 31 paise to a ten-month low of 62.33 versus the Greenback on strong demand for the US dollar due to oil firms stepping up purchases of crude oil trading near 5-year lows and a weak trend in shares.
Concerns related to capital outflows and a strong dollar in overseas markets against other currencies like the Japanese Yen too weighed on the rupee, a forex dealer said.
Logging its fourth consecutive session of decline, the domestic unit has now shed 56 paise against the US dollar.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the rupee resumed lower at 62.15 a dollar from its Wednesday's close of 62.02 and immediately the intra-day high of 62.12.
However, weakness in the domestic equity market throughout the day put pressure on the domestic currency.
The rupee gradually declined to a low of 62.3575 before ending at 62.33, logging a fall of 31 paise.
This is the currency's weakest close since February, 2014.
In terms of single-session fall, Thursday's 31-paise slide is its biggest drop against the US dollar since October 16, when it had slumped by 42 paise.
The American unit got a lift against the rupee as unwinding of the Yen and Euro carry trades triggered a sell-off in local equities.
"The sell-off global equity market has spilled over into Indian shores as well. As a result, we have seen buying of US Dollars... Over the past two sessions. There was demand noted from a few PSUs," said Anindya Banerjee, Currency Analyst, Kotak Securities.
Meanwhile, the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex on Thursday , after taking a respite for a day, tumbled by 229.09 points (or 0.82 per cent).
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out US $6.92 million on Wednesday, as per data released by market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
The dollar index was up by 0.06 per cent against its six major global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said, "Indian Rupee depreciated by half per cent, taking cues from dollar index which is trading multi-year highs. Also, the dollar demand from oil companies dented the rupee movement further. There is caution ahead of consumer price inflation data due tomorrow (Friday)."
The trading range for the spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 62.00 to 62.70, Brahmbhatt added.

Medical students stage #WhiteCoats4BlackLives protests across the country after grand jury decisionsBy Abby Phillip December 11, 2014 Follow @abbydphillip
Students from the University of Minnesota’s Medical School and School of Public Health staged a die-in Wednesday. (Blair Emerson/Minnesota Daily via AP)
Medical students nationwide staged a “white coat die-in” on Wednesday as protests continued in the wake of grand jury decisions in the deaths of two black men,  Eric Garner and Michael Brown .
According to reports , students from dozens of schools participated in the protest. They carried signs that said “Black lives matter” and “#whitecoats4blacklives” and “Hands up, don’t shoot” and, in reference to Garner’s final words , “We can’t breathe.”
Last month, a grand jury in Missouri  declined to indict a white Ferguson police officer in the Aug. 9 shooting death of Brown, an unarmed black teenager. A week later , a grand jury in Staten Island decided not to indict a white New York Police Department officer in the chokehold death of Garner during an attempted arrest. Police said Garner was illegally selling untaxed cigarettes.
On Wednesday afternoon, demonstrators on multiple medical school campuses positioned themselves on the floors outside entryways and in halls, forming small seas of white jackets dotted with the messages of protest. Some held a moment of silence for 45 minutes in recognition of the 4 1/2 hours that Brown’s body remained in the street on Canfield Drive in Ferguson after he was killed.

Coai asks DoT to allocate 800MHz spectrum as EGSM bandCOAI asks DoT to allocate 800MHz spectrum as EGSM band
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 12, 2014 12:39 AM IST
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has asked the department of telecom (DoT) to allocate 800 MHz band of spectrum as the extended GSM (E-GSM) band, as the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has suggested, considering the fact that the demand for 900 MHz is admittedly much higher than 800 MHz.
“The demand for 900 MHz is admittedly much higher than 800 MHz and CDMA operators also aspire to acquire 900MHz. It will be a sensible decision, both technically and economically, to harmonise the vacant 800 MHz spectrum, refarm it to E-GSM band and auction it as 900 MHz band,” Rajan Mathews, COAI director-general, said in a letter to DoT secretary Rakesh Garg.
Mathews said the reconfiguration of the available 800MHz spectrum will not only increase the availability of spectrum in the 900MHz band but will also lead to more efficient use of spectrum. "It will also benefit the government through revenue generation and also help increase the broadband penetration in the country. There will be no impact on the existing CDMA operations as they can continue providing the services with the allocated spectrum," he noted.
In his letter, he also pointed out that the Government failed to get any bidders for 800MHz spectrum in the auction held in November 2012. Coai has made several representations to the government to reconfigure the existing 800MHz band and offer it as E-GSM as it will result in far more efficient utilisation of spectrum in the 800MHz band.
"We thus once again request the government to auction 800 MHz band for E-GSM. The 800 MHz band accounts for nearly half of the spectrum available for commercial use in the sub-1 GHz band. Putting this spectrum to the most optimal use should be a policy priority," added the COAI boss.

Akhilesh lays foundation of Trans-Ganga City ProjectAkhilesh lays foundation of Trans-Ganga City Project
Virendra Singh Rawat | Lucknow Dec 11, 2014 06:16 PM IST
Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav today laid the foundation of Trans-Ganga Project in the neighbouring Unnao district.
The project, propped as a modern and clean-green city, would be developed by UP State Industrial Development Corporation (UPSIDC).
Unnao is situated strategically between the state capital of Lucknow and industry town of Kanpur. It is the ground zero of the proposed Lucknow Industrial Development Authority (LIDA).
The Unnao project would span 1,156 acres near Ganga Barrage in Kanpur City. It would be 70 km from Lucknow international airport and had been conceptualised for spurring investment, job creation, education, health and industrial development in the region.
Post development, an investment of Rs 10,000 core is expected to flow in the mega project, which would create about 1,00,000 direct and indirect jobs.
It is proposed to be equipped with international infrastructure facilities. Under the project, along with industrial and residential areas, commercial and institutional areas would be developed.
A housing society comprising exhibition centre, multiplex, mega mall and multi-storied residential complexes are proposed. The industries in the enclave would be pollution free and it would be zero discharge area, so that it does not cause adverse impact on the ecology and Ganga river.
At the inauguration ceremony, Akhilesh asked officials to make efforts to set up Design & Skill Development University at Trans-Ganga City.
Akhilesh government has accorded priority to energy and infrastructure development projects for speedier economic growth. UP is targetting industrial growth rate of 11 percent and several projects have been launched viz. Lucknow Metro Rail, Lucknow IT City, Agra-Lucknow Expressway etc.

New Delhi: India's strategic partnership with Russia is 'incomparable in content', said Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Russia has been "a pillar of strength" for India, said Modi after holding the annual summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin who is on a day-long visit to New Delhi.
Modi said that "we have met twice at the opposite ends of the world - at Brazil and Australia". He recalled that President Putin and the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee launched the annual summit process in 2000.
Modi said the two countries have "a strategic partnership that is incomparable in content". Russia has been "a steadfast supporter" even in difficult moments of history, he added.
PM Modi said, "President Putin is a leader of a great nation with which we have unmatched friendship."

Speaking after his summit talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin said there is a need to boost trade between India and Russia. "Russia is keen to deepen the political dialogue between the two countries to strengthen cooperation in various areas," he added.
The Russian President said the two countries have a special privileged partnership and it continues to develop dynamically.
Referring to the annual bilateral trade, the leader said it was not enough. "We talked of measures to diversify bilateral trade," Putin added.
India has agreed to identify a second site for Russian-designed nuclear plants, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said on Thursday.
In a series of tweets following summit-level talks between PM Modi and Russian President Putin, Akbaruddin said the two countries have agreed on strategic vision to strengthen cooperation in atomic energy. "At Summit India-Russia agree on Strategic Vision to strengthen cooperation in peaceful uses of atomic energy," Akbaruddin tweeted.
Earlier, India and Russia held their 15th Annual Summit talks in New Delhi on Thursday.

Guardians of the gallery0
The space Icon created feels more like a comfortable library than a climate-controlled storage unit. Several years ago, Myers hosted a team from New York-based Harper Collins that visited Chicago to work with the archive’s staff on “Every Thing On It,” a posthumous collection of some of Silverstein’s previously unpublished poems and drawings.
“That’s when having a space like this makes sense,” Myers says.
Providing custom amenities keeps Icon competitive against a small but well-established group of rival fine art specialists, as well as large moving and storage companies with fine art divisions. MacGilpin models his customer service style after his father, an old-fashioned doctor who made house calls at any time of day. He pushed early on to set up the company’s shuttle service between Chicago and New York, and today his trucks make interim stops in cities like Pittsburgh and Cleveland, expanding Icon’s geographic reach. Back in Chicago, one draw for customers storing their pieces at the warehouse is the facility’s viewing room, a large blank space that can be transformed into a gallery-like environment. It’s a place where clients can display their objects without taking them out of the warehouse. Art dealers can host potential buyers there, and one client once brought in a videographer to shoot a documentary about his collection.
“Some people will just do crating or storage maybe, or not do long-distance transportation,” MacGilpin says. “I’ve been of the philosophy that we need to get the phone to ring. We need to provide as many services as we can. And if we get them to call and we can serve their need, then we’re ahead of the next guy.”
Early inspiration
MacGilpin’s first foray into the industry came during graduate school at Northern Illinois University, where he helped manage a gallery program that hosted art shows. One traveling exhibition belonged to a puppeteer with a collection that included ventriloquist dummies, large Italian marionettes and shadow puppets from Thailand.
“The person who owned all these items showed up to us in Ryder rental trucks and trunks with the things just thrown in there, and I said to myself, ‘This guy needs help,’” MacGilpin recalled. He built some basic wooden crates lined with packing material for the puppet collector, and the project got him thinking about a job in services for the art industry. This path seemed more practical than teaching or making art, the most common careers for MFA graduates.
MacGilpin connected with an artist acquaintance in Chicago, who owned a step van and had just started moving art objects for a small group of clients. The two men went into business together, doing the jobs themselves, and grossed just $15,000 in their first year. In 1990, a decade after the company was founded, MacGilpin’s partner left to pursue art full-time. MacGilpin found himself running the company solo during a recession.
That period marked a turning point for the business. Early clients had had been galleries and individual collectors. Now MacGilpin realized he needed to woo museums, because they keep moving, packing and displaying art even when the broader art market declines.
“The museums are really the more stable clients, and that’s one thing I definitely learned over time: who to focus your market to so that you can survive,” MacGilpin says.
Museums may be stable clients, but they’re also demanding. They led the way in creating the modern standards for handling, packing and storing art, beginning in the 1880s. The industry bible, a 530-page handbook titled “Museum Registration Methods,” was first published in 1958. In the past decade, art custodians have looked for ways to reduce waste and switched to newer materials that don’t release potentially damaging gases. They use industrial plastic wrap, foam of different densities, bubble wrap, cardboard and quilted moving blankets.
Deciding how best to handle each object becomes its own creative exercise. “This year alone, our crew will install a Fiat on the wall, an exhibition containing sound and lighting requirements that mimic a full-on concert production, sculptures requiring cranes and rigging, and materials woven together with human hair,” Annie Breckenridge Barrett, director of collections and exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, wrote in an email. The MCA is an Icon client.

Tech Mahindra to invest Rs 500 Cr in OdishaTech Mahindra to invest Rs 500 cr in Odisha
BS Reporter | Bhubaneswar Dec 11, 2014 08:33 PM IST
Country’s fifth largest software services firm, Tech Mahindra has lined up Rs 500 crore for investment in Odisha over next five to seven years.
“We would like to take an additional space for 5,000 people. We have plans to invest Rs 500 crore over the next five to seven years in Odisha,” C P Gurnani, chief executive officer and managing director of Tech Mahindra told media persons. Gurnani said, the new jobs would include technical associates, data scientists, business analysts etc.
The company today inaugurated a new block at its existing campus to house 615 more IT professionals taking the total headcount in the state to 1,111. The new block is built at a cost of Rs 55 crore.
State IT minister Pranab Prakash Das said, the government and Tech Mahindra are in talks for developing a second campus at the proposed Infovalley, located on the outskirts of the city.
The software firm, which crossed $10 billion market capitalisation in December, employs around 100,000 workforce and provides customer services to more than 650 clients globally. The company today said, it is ready to contribute for the development of Bhubaneswar into a digital city.
It may be noted, the state government has already announced to spend around Rs 5,000 crore from the state budget in next five years towards development of IT/ ITes and ESDM (electronic system design and manufacturing) sectors. To start with, the state government has decided to make the entire Bhubaneswar City WiFi enabled. For implementing the project, the state IT department has engaged Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) as the consultant.
“I am happy that today Tech Mahindra is adding a new block to its existing centre which will add 615 seats. I was informed that Tech Mahindra is currently operating in Bhubaneswar with 600 IT professionals working for global customers across the IT value chain from consulting to support services. I hope Tech Mahindra will continue to expand its growth and employment contribution in Bhubaneswar in future,” Chief Minister Naveen Pathaik said after inaugurating the block.

Bangladesh salvages oil-leaking sunken tanker inSundarbansBy: Press Trust of India | Dhaka |
Posted: December 11, 2014 7:31 pm
Bangladesh on Thursday retrieved an oil-leaking sunken tanker, two days after it capsized in a river at the Sundarbans, as the oil overnight spread in 34,000 hectares at the world’s largest mangrove forest.
“The oil tanker, Southern Star 7, has been salvaged. A rescue vessel pulled it out from the river and towed it to a nearby shoal,” a forest official said.
Only two out of six chambers of the tanker remained intact as rest four emptied after being hit by a cargo vessel, Chairman of nearby Mongla Port Commodore Habibur Rahman said adding that the tanker was carrying 350,000 liters of furnace oil while the two chambers contained 100,000 litres.
No official estimate was issued on the extent of oil spillage but sources said it might have spread over 50 km on the waters of Shela where the tanker sank, and Pashur rivers.
Authorities, meanwhile, ordered an intensified campaign to remove oil from the waters as it had spread quickly through a wide network of rivers and channels in and around the forest.
Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan said powdered chemicals would be sprayed from a vessel to subside the oil so that the risk of oxygen reduction in the water could be minimised.
Officials said the rescue vessel is equipped with oil dispersants, which can handle up to 10,000 litres of oil.
“We have planned measures to remove the oil by the next three days also engaging local fishermen to use their traditional methods of neutralising oil,” Rahman said.
The forest officials, however, began the use of fishing nets to sweep away oil since last night while the local administration also asked the residents at the neighbourhood to collect oil and sell the substance to the state-owned Padma Oil Company to get back incentives.
The government shut down a riverine route pierced through the Sundarbans for movement of vessels “until further order”.
The measures came following an overnight inter-ministerial meeting with the shipping minister amid calls from environmental activists to ban commercial vessels in the routes in and around the Sundarbans.
TV footages showed the Shela river painted with black layers of oil with the oil sweeping across the surface and the mangrove plantation on its both sides.
Locals said they spotted several forest animals like lizards and otters floating dead near the river banks. The scene of the accident is known as a sanctuary for dolphins and different rare aquatic animals and fishes.
The Sundarbans forest, which covers 26,000 square km in India and Bangladesh, is also the habitat of famous Royal Bengal Tigers.

PM Narendra Modi  Vladimir Putin assure industry of steps to boost bilateraltradeBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 7:14 pm
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi today assured industry leaders from the two countries of measures to enhance bilateral trade and investments.
Among those who attended the meeting included Shashi and Ravi Ruia of Essar Group, State Bank of India’s chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, L&T chief A M Naik, Mahindra Group Chairman and Managing Director Anand Mahindra and CII Director
General Chandrajit Banerjee.
Putin, who is on a visit to India, was accompanied by a high-level delegation that includes business tycoons.
Representatives of India Inc raised various issues to increase trade flows in sectors like pharmaceuticals, banking, energy and infrastructure.
“The meeting was good. The leaders assured us that they will make all efforts to resolve issues to facilitate trade and investment,” said an industry representative.
The bilateral trade between the countries stood at USD 6 billion in 2013-14. India has received USD 935.68 million during April 2000 and September 2014.
Later both the leaders inaugurated the World Diamond Conference here.
Twelve Indian companies have signed contracts with Russian diamond mining giant ALROSA to source diamonds worth USD 2.1
billion in the next three years.
In one of the biggest oil deals, Essar Group has signed a USD 10 billion contract to import crude oil from Russia over a 10-year period.
Essar signed a deal with Russia’s top crude oil producer Rosneft to buy 10 million tons a year of oil, worth about USD 10 billion, for 10 years beginning 2015.

U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as crude oil prices continued their descent, but the S&P closed out a third straight year of double-digit gains.
For the year, the Dow ended up 7.5 percent, notching its sixth straight annual gain, and the Nasdaq rose 13.4 percent. The best-performing S&P component in 2014 was Southwest Airlines Co  up 124.6 percent, while Transocean Ltd , down 62.9 percent, was the worst.

Equities lost steam heading into the New Year after rallying nearly 6 percent over eight sessions, sparked by the U.S. Federal Reserve's commitment to be "patient" about raising interest rates and positive economic data.
Still, the S&P 500 has risen in seven of the past ten sessions, hitting a series of intraday and closing records, and finished the year up 11.4 percent. The stock market will be closed Thursday.
"The fact of the matter is markets put in a solid year in spite of significant headwinds that could have easily derailed a multi-year bull market," said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.

"The most the bears got out of this year was a 10 percent correction on an intraday basis and the markets stubbornly moved higher, and for good foundational reasons."
Gains may be tougher to come by next year, and a pick-up in profits growth may be essential if the market is to continue to add to its historic gains.
Action in the energy space was once again a focus for investors. U.S. crude oil  settled down 85 cents at $53.27 a barrel, its lowest since May 2009. Brent  settled down 57 cents to $57.33.
The S&P Energy index <.SPNY>, easily the worst performing sector of the year with a decline of 10 percent, lost 0.8 percent Wednesday. Diamond Offshore  fell 3.6 percent to $36.71 and Noble Corp  fell 2.8 percent to $16.57.
The CBOE volatility index <.VIX>, which measures the cost of protection against a drop on the S&P 500, surged 20.4 percent, its biggest jump since Dec. 10 and the fourth straight climb. Quarterly options on the S&P 500 expire at the end of the month.
"Part of it may be the quarterly expiration of S&P options but a lot of it has to do with crude being down today," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at retail brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.
Traders might be also looking to load up on some protection before they head out for the holiday, Kinahan said.
"We had such a nice year that many people may be looking to buy some protection for a 'just-in-case scenario' for between now and the new year," Kinahan said.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 160 points, or 0.89 percent, to 17,823.07, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 21.45 points, or 1.03 percent, to 2,058.9 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 41.39 points, or 0.87 percent, to 4,736.05.
Volume was light, with about 5.21 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.95 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.
Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE 2,000 to 1,105, for a 1.81-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,571 issues fell and 1,194 advanced for a 1.32-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 35 new lows.

There shouldn t be a conflict between religion and scienceCharmy Harikrishnan        Edition: Dec 7, 2014
Bestselling author Dan Brown
Dan Brown, the bestselling author, was recently in India, where he first came as a teenager in a choir. He is writing his seventh book, another thriller featuring his code-breaking symbologist Robert Langdon. Brown's novels have sold more than 220 million copies worldwide, and nine lakh copies in India. In Delhi for the Penguin Annual Lecture, he spoke with Charmy Harikrishnan on the conflict between science and religion, how he writes and why he does not have a code for writing bestsellers. Edited excerpts:
WELCOME BACK TO INDIA.
It has been a long time. I was in India when I was 19 as part of the Amherst College's men's choir. We toured about 13 countries and sang at the Kamani Auditorium in New Delhi. We also sang India's national anthem but I couldn't, for the life of me, remember it. So I had a taxi driver sing it for me the other night.
ARE YOU WRITING ANOTHER NOVEL?
I am in the process of writing another Robert Langdon book. I am researching, learning.
WHEN DID YOU START WRITING?
"I like the concept of secrets hidden in plain sight. A code is like the screen between you and the truth"
I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be a writer. When I was five, I dictated a story to my mother, who wrote it down and bound it. That was my first book and I still have it. But I realised I wanted to be thriller writer much later. It wasn't until I was out of college and found a Sidney Sheldon novel on the beach of Moorea in Tahiti that I decided to be a writer. It was fun, light and fast, sort of adult Hardy Boys. I thought this is the kind of writing I could do.
EXPLAIN IN A LINE OR TWO THESE ELEMENTS IN YOUR BOOKS:
Codes: I like the concept of secrets hidden in plain sight. A code is like the screen that stands between you and the truth. So much of the world is like that. I think the scripture is a code, possibly the greatest code. The problem with religion is that it reads metaphorical stories as facts.
A 24-hour time frame: I like books that move quickly. If I can't say a story in 24 hours then I think I am being lazy.
Strwing the book with italics: That is interior monologue. It is a way for the reader to get into the head of the characters.
Langdon, and his brainy Bond: I am interested in a hero that is more like an everyday man, one who escapes difficult situations with his mind rather than his gun. He is the person I would have liked to be.
Strong women: I am surrounded by strong women - my wife, my mother and my agent. They are great role models. I find powerful women very attractive.
Fast planes: I am fascinated with technology and every little boy dreams of flying. Those two have come together. And if I need to get something done in 24 hours, I better have fast planes.
DID THE REACTION OF THE VATICAN TO THE DA VINCI CODE SURPRISE YOU?
Yes, absolutely. These books are fiction. I don't proclaim to have the correct answers. In the novel, I asked the question: what if Jesus were not the son of God, what if he were just a great man with a wonderful message? I thought that was a fine question to ask. This idea that your saviour is divine, to my way of thinking, separates god from man. I don't like that separation, but the Church likes it because it has become the tollbooth to heaven. They have established themselves between man and god. There is a longing in most of us to bypass that.
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF BOOKS RECENTLY, THE LATEST BEING THE LOST GOSPEL, THAT GOES AGAINST WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT JESUS CHRIST.
I truly believe that the Christian gospels have been heavily edited and selected to create a certain mythology, so it is not surprising that a number of other stories about Christ are now coming out.
IN MANY OF YOUR BOOKS YOU TALK ABOUT THE GREAT CONFLICT BETWEEN SCIENCE AND RELIGION.
There is a conflict between religion and science, but there shouldn't be. That is because we take the scriptures literally. Religion is at fault for taking scriptures literally, science is at fault for assuming it can answer every single question.
WHEN DO YOU WRITE?
I write all seven days. I wake up at 4 a.m. and write till 10 or 11 in the morning. I write very slowly. For every one page in a book, there are 10 that I threw out. I write books I would want to read. I step away from my writing and say: "Imagine Dan, you are on the beach, and this book by a guy named John Smith is lying there. Will you read it?" Until I say: "This guy John Smith I love this," I am not done.
IS THERE A BESTSELLER CODE THAT YOU HAVE CRACKED?
Not really. My first three books - The Digital Fortress, Deception Point and Angels & Demons - sold only 10,000 copies worldwide until The Da Vinci Code became a success.
WILL YOUR BOOK WIN A MAN BOOKER PRIZE?
Probably not. The Man Booker prize is for a very specific kind of book. And my books are not that kind of books. I am criticised for my writing. But it is hard to write this way, when the story just comes at you instead of your being distracted by florid writing. If my fans buy my books, I don't need a prize.

2014 FT Appeal: Syrias stolen childhoodsVideo feature Refugees in America
Eleven million Syrians have been forced to flee their homes — and there is no sign that Syria’s almost four-year uprising-turned-civil war is going to end soon. The immediate priorities in a refugee crisis are relatively straightforward: people need shelter and food. But when it becomes a long-term crisis — growing at a rate of 5,000 people a day — the effort can be overwhelming.
Fatima and her mother found hope in a women’s support centre run by the International Rescue Committee, the humanitarian organisation selected by the FT for its 2014 seasonal appeal . Founded by Albert Einstein in 1933 to rescue German families facing Nazi persecution, the charity now works in more than 30 countries, from Myanmar to Zimbabwe, providing relief after tsunamis or building long-term health clinics.
In 2014 the IRC provided aid to 14.8m people, including 4m Syrian refugees.
With aid groups struggling to provide food, medicine and education, young women are often overlooked, though they are among the most at-risk members of the Syrian refugee population.
“Refugee girls are in a prison . . . At night in the camp, you hear women crying, men beating wives. Half of those wives are under 14,” says Fatima’s mother — the dark rings under her eyes a sign of troubled days.
With limited access to education, girls can lose their future. Parents who once protected their daughters are often traumatised themselves and can become abusive or so impoverished that they agree to early marriage — a practice aid workers say increases the chance of a girl being forced into prostitution.
In muddy settlements that house thousands of refugees , the fear of assault means that many girls rarely leave the worn tarpaulin tents that flood during winter and bake in the summer heat.
“The centre encourages us to live, to find our strengths,” says Fatima’s mother, who stays hopeful despite an ongoing struggle with family abuse. “If it wasn’t for this, my daughter might be gone — maybe I would have committed suicide, too.”
IRC on the ground
The IRC has more than 30 women’s centres spread across refugee camps in northern Syria and neighbouring countries. Women’s protection and empowerment is one of dozens of programmes the charity manages as part of its Syria response, which deals with a range of needs from healthcare to job training.
The IRC, which had income of $456m last year, focuses on emergency and development work around the world. In addition to the Syria crisis response that spans five countries, it has set up clinics to treat Ebola patients in west Africa and distributed aid to Iraqis fleeing the advance of jihadi militants. It also works in the US to resettle refugees who get a chance to start a new life.
Finding long-term solutions for refugees is crucial to regional stability. The camps are fertile recruitment grounds for radical groups. Mass movements of people create economic strains that can spark unrest in the areas they flee to. But as the world’s largest refugee crisis deepens, funds are drying up. Last week the UN announced it was cutting vital food vouchers to 1.7m Syrian refugees due to a funding shortfall.
More video
The IRC has also been forced to divert funds from Syria. To multiply the impact of reader contributions to this year’s appeal, the British government will double their value by matching each donation. Those funds will go directly to the IRC’s Syria projects.
“The Syrian crisis is the defining humanitarian catastrophe of this century so far,” says David Miliband, the president and chief executive of the IRC. “The scale of displacement, with half the country’s 22m population forced to flee their homes, is too big for most people to grasp.”
War, disease and environmental disasters have contributed to what is now the biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. The UN says more than 51m people globally have fled their homes. Mr Miliband, former UK foreign secretary, says he wants the IRC to help change the aid business to better meet the needs of today’s refugees, especially women.

- David Miliband, president and chief executive of the IRC
The IRC has been at the forefront of experimenting with more effective ways to provide support, in particular, “cash-aid” projects that give money instead of basic staples. Proponents say this lets aid groups help both the displaced and their hosts: refugees buy their necessities from locals whose economies are otherwise drained by rapid population influxes. Psychological counsellors also attend training courses to support victims of abuse or depression.
Sara Abu Assali, head of the IRC’s women’s programmes in Turkey, says rehabilitation is critical: “Think about it this way: who else will rebuild Syria?”
Just reaching camps in Syria can be a challenge, as roads, checkpoints and towns constantly swap hands between different armed groups. Convincing conservative families, who often forbid women to leave home, is another hurdle. In spite of that, some 2,000 women make almost daily visits to the IRC’s eight makeshift women’s centres in northern Syria.
The IRC sends “mobile teams” to try to reach more camps but these efforts are a drop in the ocean. Displaced Syrians scattered along the northern border have built about 500 different settlements — some house tens of thousands of inhabitants. The IRC says its work is critical because many camp-based youth programmes unintentionally omit girls; gender mixing is not socially acceptable after adolescence.
Desperate measures
The IRC women’s programmes worked regularly with at least 32,000 refugee women this year. But even success stories can be overtaken by fresh abuse. Fatima was one such case. The scars down her arms healed as IRC counsellors treated her depression. But shortly afterwards her father sent her away to marry a cousin twice her age.
While there are no reliable statistics on abuse or self-harm, Fatima’s mother says many girls now experiment with cutting. Other young women went further. “One set herself on fire. They buried her outside the camp. Another tried to kill herself drinking chlorine but they took her to the hospital and pumped her stomach,” she sighs. “I knew another girl who was only 15 and had already been married off by her family three times. She tried to run away.”
Stopping all early marriages is impossible. In some rural parts of Syria it was common. But most Syrians waited until their daughters finished university. Now there is no school and as the crisis drags on, families are tempted by foreign suitors offering dowries for brides.
Heba, a bubbly 26-year-old dressed in a leather jacket and white headscarf, is not discouraged. The areas in northern Syria where she runs IRC women’s centres were too dangerous to visit, so she crossed the border to meet the FT in Turkey. For her own safety, we have withheld her full name.
At night in the camp, you hear women crying, men beating wives. Half of those wives are under 14
- Fatima’s mother
Heba fears the worst for the girls she could not help. “It’s hard to know what happens beyond the rumours that come back. We rarely ever hear from them again.” Some women, she says, are unwittingly “married” to men in Turkey or the Gulf, without realising their status is not official or legal. Many are believed to be forced into prostitution.
Even a girl’s tent can be unsafe. The brutality of war affects behaviour, especially among boys who come of age during the conflict. “It has got to the point where you have cases of girls molested by brothers or uncles,” says Heba. Navigating these environments is complicated. Many women feel too ashamed to admit they have been abused.
In Lebanon, female refugees can perhaps seek out secret shelters. But in lawless northern Syria there are no safe houses, no legal recourse. Instead, Heba and her peers teach coping strategies.
At a refugee youth centre in Turkey, a counsellor called Manal sits with a group of giggling girls who shout suggestions as she writes on a board, “Ways to say no”, at a friend’s request.
The girls practise sentences together to see what works best. Later, Manal suggests adapting the idea for parents who do not want to let them leave the house or go to school.
“We start with little things,” says Heba. “If she can’t do that, how can she argue about bigger issues like marriage?” Once the girls and women start talking, confidence grows quickly, she says. “Sometimes we don’t have to say much ourselves, we just create an opportunity . . . they will start trading advice,” she says. “Older women who married early, for example, will tell younger mothers, ‘I suffered a lot. Try to do better for your daughter’.”
With more funding, the IRC hopes that the women’s tents could even offer a base to help them organise small business ventures to support their families.
Fatima’s mother is learning to speak up too, before her younger daughter faces the same fate as her sister. “I thought I had no friends, I was afraid of the world . . . Now I’m responding to my husband. The last time he tried to beat her, I spoke up.”
She smiles and adds, almost in disbelief: “He actually listened. I got a result.”

Letter from the editor
The humanitarian crisis in and around Syria, as powerfully described in Erika Solomon’s report, has become a catastrophe of unprecedented proportions. About half of Syria’s pre-conflict population of 22m people have fled their homes to escape the violence, many of them pouring into neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, which are struggling to cope with the inflows.
This year the staff of the Financial Times have voted to support the International Rescue Committee, one of the most active non-governmental organisations trying to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Syria. The IRC also works on the frontline in many other countries, giving people the technical support and financial means to help rebuild their lives, and is also playing a vital role in west Africa in combating the spread of Ebola.
At a time when hostility towards refugees and migrants is rising in many parts of the world, the FT is proud to support the IRC’s work, which is still guided by the humanitarian spirit of its founder Albert Einstein, and its mission to “assist victims of civil oppression in many lands without reference to religious or political faith”.
Over the next few weeks FT correspondents will report on the range of the IRC’s activities across the Middle East, southeast Asia, Africa and the US. You can follow all these reports at ft.com/seasonal-appeal
We hope that you will give generously to this year’s appeal, as you have done every year since 2006. In total we have helped to raise more than £14m with our charity partners over that time.
This year the British government is providing matched funding for the appeal. Justine Greening, the UK international development secretary, says: “Many Syrian children have known nothing but conflict their whole lives and now face a fourth harsh winter away from home.
“By matching pound for pound all public donations to the FT Seasonal Appeal, we will double the difference IRC can make. That means more medicine, clean water and access to education and a clear message to Syrian children that the world has not forgotten them.”
The IRC has also received generous donations from American Express, Novartis, the Asfari Foundation and the Lundin Foundation.

Fatima and her mother found hope in a women’s support centre run by the International Rescue Committee, the humanitarian organisation selected by the FT for its 2014 seasonal appeal . Founded by Albert Einstein in 1933 to rescue German families facing Nazi persecution, the charity now works in more than 30 countries, from Myanmar to Zimbabwe, providing relief after tsunamis or building long-term health clinics.
In 2014 the IRC provided aid to 14.8m people, including 4m Syrian refugees.
With aid groups struggling to provide food, medicine and education, young women are often overlooked, though they are among the most at-risk members of the Syrian refugee population.
“Refugee girls are in a prison . . . At night in the camp, you hear women crying, men beating wives. Half of those wives are under 14,” says Fatima’s mother — the dark rings under her eyes a sign of troubled days.
With limited access to education, girls can lose their future. Parents who once protected their daughters are often traumatised themselves and can become abusive or so impoverished that they agree to early marriage — a practice aid workers say increases the chance of a girl being forced into prostitution.
In muddy settlements that house thousands of refugees , the fear of assault means that many girls rarely leave the worn tarpaulin tents that flood during winter and bake in the summer heat.
“The centre encourages us to live, to find our strengths,” says Fatima’s mother, who stays hopeful despite an ongoing struggle with family abuse. “If it wasn’t for this, my daughter might be gone — maybe I would have committed suicide, too.”
IRC on the ground
The IRC has more than 30 women’s centres spread across refugee camps in northern Syria and neighbouring countries. Women’s protection and empowerment is one of dozens of programmes the charity manages as part of its Syria response, which deals with a range of needs from healthcare to job training.
The IRC, which had income of $456m last year, focuses on emergency and development work around the world. In addition to the Syria crisis response that spans five countries, it has set up clinics to treat Ebola patients in west Africa and distributed aid to Iraqis fleeing the advance of jihadi militants. It also works in the US to resettle refugees who get a chance to start a new life.
Finding long-term solutions for refugees is crucial to regional stability. The camps are fertile recruitment grounds for radical groups. Mass movements of people create economic strains that can spark unrest in the areas they flee to. But as the world’s largest refugee crisis deepens, funds are drying up. Last week the UN announced it was cutting vital food vouchers to 1.7m Syrian refugees due to a funding shortfall.

The IRC has also been forced to divert funds from Syria. To multiply the impact of reader contributions to this year’s appeal, the British government will double their value by matching each donation. Those funds will go directly to the IRC’s Syria projects.
“The Syrian crisis is the defining humanitarian catastrophe of this century so far,” says David Miliband, the president and chief executive of the IRC. “The scale of displacement, with half the country’s 22m population forced to flee their homes, is too big for most people to grasp.”
War, disease and environmental disasters have contributed to what is now the biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. The UN says more than 51m people globally have fled their homes. Mr Miliband, former UK foreign secretary, says he wants the IRC to help change the aid business to better meet the needs of today’s refugees, especially women.

- David Miliband, president and chief executive of the IRC
The IRC has been at the forefront of experimenting with more effective ways to provide support, in particular, “cash-aid” projects that give money instead of basic staples. Proponents say this lets aid groups help both the displaced and their hosts: refugees buy their necessities from locals whose economies are otherwise drained by rapid population influxes. Psychological counsellors also attend training courses to support victims of abuse or depression.
Sara Abu Assali, head of the IRC’s women’s programmes in Turkey, says rehabilitation is critical: “Think about it this way: who else will rebuild Syria?”
Just reaching camps in Syria can be a challenge, as roads, checkpoints and towns constantly swap hands between different armed groups. Convincing conservative families, who often forbid women to leave home, is another hurdle. In spite of that, some 2,000 women make almost daily visits to the IRC’s eight makeshift women’s centres in northern Syria.
The IRC sends “mobile teams” to try to reach more camps but these efforts are a drop in the ocean. Displaced Syrians scattered along the northern border have built about 500 different settlements — some house tens of thousands of inhabitants. The IRC says its work is critical because many camp-based youth programmes unintentionally omit girls; gender mixing is not socially acceptable after adolescence.
Desperate measures
The IRC women’s programmes worked regularly with at least 32,000 refugee women this year. But even success stories can be overtaken by fresh abuse. Fatima was one such case. The scars down her arms healed as IRC counsellors treated her depression. But shortly afterwards her father sent her away to marry a cousin twice her age.
While there are no reliable statistics on abuse or self-harm, Fatima’s mother says many girls now experiment with cutting. Other young women went further. “One set herself on fire. They buried her outside the camp. Another tried to kill herself drinking chlorine but they took her to the hospital and pumped her stomach,” she sighs. “I knew another girl who was only 15 and had already been married off by her family three times. She tried to run away.”
Stopping all early marriages is impossible. In some rural parts of Syria it was common. But most Syrians waited until their daughters finished university. Now there is no school and as the crisis drags on, families are tempted by foreign suitors offering dowries for brides.
Heba, a bubbly 26-year-old dressed in a leather jacket and white headscarf, is not discouraged. The areas in northern Syria where she runs IRC women’s centres were too dangerous to visit, so she crossed the border to meet the FT in Turkey. For her own safety, we have withheld her full name.
At night in the camp, you hear women crying, men beating wives. Half of those wives are under 14
- Fatima’s mother
Heba fears the worst for the girls she could not help. “It’s hard to know what happens beyond the rumours that come back. We rarely ever hear from them again.” Some women, she says, are unwittingly “married” to men in Turkey or the Gulf, without realising their status is not official or legal. Many are believed to be forced into prostitution.
Even a girl’s tent can be unsafe. The brutality of war affects behaviour, especially among boys who come of age during the conflict. “It has got to the point where you have cases of girls molested by brothers or uncles,” says Heba. Navigating these environments is complicated. Many women feel too ashamed to admit they have been abused.
In Lebanon, female refugees can perhaps seek out secret shelters. But in lawless northern Syria there are no safe houses, no legal recourse. Instead, Heba and her peers teach coping strategies.
At a refugee youth centre in Turkey, a counsellor called Manal sits with a group of giggling girls who shout suggestions as she writes on a board, “Ways to say no”, at a friend’s request.
The girls practise sentences together to see what works best. Later, Manal suggests adapting the idea for parents who do not want to let them leave the house or go to school.
“We start with little things,” says Heba. “If she can’t do that, how can she argue about bigger issues like marriage?” Once the girls and women start talking, confidence grows quickly, she says. “Sometimes we don’t have to say much ourselves, we just create an opportunity . . . they will start trading advice,” she says. “Older women who married early, for example, will tell younger mothers, ‘I suffered a lot. Try to do better for your daughter’.”
With more funding, the IRC hopes that the women’s tents could even offer a base to help them organise small business ventures to support their families.
Fatima’s mother is learning to speak up too, before her younger daughter faces the same fate as her sister. “I thought I had no friends, I was afraid of the world . . . Now I’m responding to my husband. The last time he tried to beat her, I spoke up.”
She smiles and adds, almost in disbelief: “He actually listened. I got a result.”

Letter from the editor
The humanitarian crisis in and around Syria, as powerfully described in Erika Solomon’s report, has become a catastrophe of unprecedented proportions. About half of Syria’s pre-conflict population of 22m people have fled their homes to escape the violence, many of them pouring into neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, which are struggling to cope with the inflows.
This year the staff of the Financial Times have voted to support the International Rescue Committee, one of the most active non-governmental organisations trying to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Syria. The IRC also works on the frontline in many other countries, giving people the technical support and financial means to help rebuild their lives, and is also playing a vital role in west Africa in combating the spread of Ebola.
At a time when hostility towards refugees and migrants is rising in many parts of the world, the FT is proud to support the IRC’s work, which is still guided by the humanitarian spirit of its founder Albert Einstein, and its mission to “assist victims of civil oppression in many lands without reference to religious or political faith”.
Over the next few weeks FT correspondents will report on the range of the IRC’s activities across the Middle East, southeast Asia, Africa and the US. You can follow all these reports at ft.com/seasonal-appeal
We hope that you will give generously to this year’s appeal, as you have done every year since 2006. In total we have helped to raise more than £14m with our charity partners over that time.
This year the British government is providing matched funding for the appeal. Justine Greening, the UK international development secretary, says: “Many Syrian children have known nothing but conflict their whole lives and now face a fourth harsh winter away from home.
“By matching pound for pound all public donations to the FT Seasonal Appeal, we will double the difference IRC can make. That means more medicine, clean water and access to education and a clear message to Syrian children that the world has not forgotten them.”
The IRC has also received generous donations from American Express, Novartis, the Asfari Foundation and the Lundin Foundation.

It s a good time to enter the commodity marketStory
Losing sheen
Base metal prices have fallen quite a bit this year. It is a good time to enter the market.
Rahul Oberoi      Follow @iamrahuloberoi    Edition: December 2014
Base metals are losing strength. Lead prices slid 11% to Rs 123.10 per kg from August 12 to October 24. Between August 1 and November 3, nickel fell 14% to Rs 955.70 per kg. Aluminium declined 10% between August 29 and October 16.
Slowing demand from major buyers due to falling economic growth is putting pressure on the entire base metal pack, which comprises copper, aluminium, tin, zinc, lead and nickel and tin. Tin, however, is not traded on Indian exchanges.
In the domestic market , the metals slid nearly 6% in August-October. The London Metal Exchange's LME index, which tracks prices of these metals, fell 4% during the period. This is good news for long-term investors as experts expect prices to recover in the next few months. However, there may be some pain in the near term.
China's metal imports have been falling for the last few quarters
According to the World Bank, global metal prices are expected to fall more than 5% in 2014 due to new supplies and low demand from China. Experts say the biggest reason for the fall is slowdown in the three biggest consumers-China, the US and Europe. According to the website of the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the Non-Manufacturing Business Index fell from 55% in June to 53.8% in October. Similarly, China's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index plunged from 51.7% in July to 50.8% in October. Industrial output in the euro area contracted 1.9% year-on-year in August, followed by a 1.6% rise in July. It is the first annual drop in a year, mainly due to contraction in production of capital goods and energy.
Aurobinda Prasad, research head, commodity and currency, Karvy Comtrade, says, "Base metals have been hit by strengthening US dollar and factors such as trimming of global growth forecast by the IMF, end to the US Fed's stimulus programme and poor economic growth in China and Europe."
OUTLOOK FOR BASE METALS
London Metal Exchange Index
LEAD
The metal is mainly used in batteries. Prices fell 11.18% to Rs 122.10 per kg between August 12 and October 24. They had risen 9.5% from Rs 121.75 per kg on April 1 to 133.40 per kg on July 30.
According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG), an international commodity organisation, global demand for refined lead is likely to rise 1.4% to 11.33 million tonnes this year and a further 2.1% to 11.56 million tonnes in 2015. The ILZSG has indicated that the global demand will exceed supply modestly in 2014 as well as 2015.
Nitin Nachnani, research analyst, Geojit Comtrade, is bullish on the commodity. "The expected deficit is 38,000 tonnes this year and 23,000 tonnes in 2015. We expect prices to rise to Rs 138-140 per kg by the end of March 2015 on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX)."
Before investing, look at demand from China's automobile units and mobile phone base stations and supply from the three big producers, Australia, China and the US.
COPPER
The industrial metal is used in manufacturing and construction. China, the largest consumer, accounts for 40% global demand.
Copper prices fell 4% between August 1 and November 3. Like in case of other base metals, the biggest reason was weak economic growth in China. Some investors are worried that slowing inflation reflects slack in China's economy as business activity slows, leading to less demand for copper.
Copper is likely to trade at Rs 400-450 per kg in the next four-five months on the MCX. On November 3, it was at Rs 412 per kg.
Renisha Chainani, manager research, Edelweiss, says, "The fall accelerated after weaker-than- expected US economic data raised concerns about demand from the world's second-largest user."
Market experts say global demand is estimated to have risen 12% to 13.4 million tonnes in the first seven months of the year compared with the same period last year. Global refined production is estimated to have risen 7% to 12.8 million tonnes from the same period of 2013. Data indicate production deficit of 5,89,000 million tonnes for the period. There was a surplus of 22,000 million tonnes in the same period in 2013.
Chainani of Edelweiss says the metal is likely to get support at lower levels due to workers' strike at some big mines in Indonesia and Peru.
ZINC
The metal is mainly used to protect steel from corrosion. It has been one of the best performers among base metals this year. It rose 11% to Rs 143 per kg this year till November 3. However, between August 1 and October 24, it fell 3%.
Aurobinda Prasad of Karvy Comtrade says, "The decline should be treated as a correction as the metal had risen very fast in the first half of the year backed by medium-to long-term fundamentals. One probable reason could be the rise in stocks on the LME from 0.65 million tonnes to 0.73 million tonnes after a decline from April to July."
Experts are bullish on zinc for the medium to long term. Between January and July, global mine production rose 2.3% while production of the refined metal rose 4% and usage surged 7.6%. The ILZSG has predicted a shortage of 4,03,000 tonnes in 2014 and 3,66,000 tonnes in 2015. LME stocks have fallen 25% this year.
Prasad says, "Expectations that major mines will shut down in 2015-16 pushed up prices. The MCX zinc November futures are trading over Rs 140 per kg. Near-term resistance is seen at Rs 149-150 per kg. A break above may extend gains up to Rs 160 in the coming months."
Tarun Satsangi, head, commodity and currency research, Globe Capital, seconds Prasad, "In the next two-three months, zinc is likely to trade in the range of Rs 128-147 per kg. However, if it breaches that level, we may see prices touch Rs 155-160 per kg."

NICKEL
Nickel is used to protect other metals from  corrosion. Its main use is in making alloys such as stainless steel.  Demand has been hit by slowdown in China and Europe. Prices started  plunging from the third quarter of 2014 and fell 14% to Rs 955 per kg  between August 1 and November 3.
Kunal Shah, head, commodity  research, Nirmal Bang Commodities, says, "Stainless steel prices also  fell sharply. Poor economic data from China and Europe added to the  pressure. Prices had shot up at the start of the year after Indonesia  banned nickel ore exports. A similar move was expected in August from  the Philippines (which accounts for one-tenth of global nickel supply)  but it did not happen, putting pressure on prices." Prices rose 30% in  the first half of the year.
Shah is bullish on the metal.  "Nickel prices are not likely to fall below Rs 900 per kg. I will not be  surprised if prices rise and test Rs 1,150 levels. The metal is likely  to remain in short supply for the rest of the year. Amid these factors,  any restocking by China could move up prices," he says.
ALUMINIUM
The metal is widely used in transport, construction, packaging and electrical sectors. It saw a U-shaped recovery between August 26 and November 3. It had fallen 10% between August 29 and October 16 due to bleak outlook for China. On November 3, it was trading at Rs 126 per kg.
Market expert say the recovery is likely to continue. Satsangi says, "Prices are likely to head north and approach Rs 135 per kg by the end of March 2015. Declining stocks on the LME since August 14 and expectation of monetary easing in China are the key factors that can drive up prices."

Dough plans global expansion of financial content firm0
Not only is it free to watch our shows or access our archives, but also it’s free to use our trading software. We just provide the access and that front-end technology. We're just starting to take advertising. That’s how a majority of financial media companies get paid, so we know there’s a huge upside for us.
Q. Where do you see streaming media going?
A. We're on Roku, Apple TV podcasts and Amazon Fire TV. That is really the direction of the future. There is an incredible movement online for video consumption. 
In that first year of establishing Tastytrade, we talked to a couple of broadcasters and started to learn a lot about the broadcast media world versus IPTV. We were working with a couple of small cable companies, and we said, “This industry is starting to be online and on demand so let’s not waste our time, money or energy entering the broadcast world.” That was a decision we made early on, and we feel like it’s the right decision.
Q. What other career-changing experience shaped your thinking today?
A. When Tom and I came together at Tastytrade, we spent a significant amount of money on marketing before we really knew exactly what our customer looked like and what we ultimately were creating, because it was too early to tell. It was a waste of money because we still hadn’t figured out exactly what we had planned to offer.
A lot of people think that marketing is creative. While there is a creative aspect to it, it is really more numbers and analytics and conversions. Creative is important, but it is an analytical job that has to continually be optimized. 
Q. You’ve talked about how men think more in the big picture and women more in detail. What do you do to get men to stop to listen to the details?
A. I have the ability to go high level and deeper on detail, and I think that’s what helps me in dealing with a number of men who only float up at a high level and miss a lot of the detail. I say, “We have to think about X, Y and Z” and there are some times where they say, “I don't care.” I say, “We need to care because” and then I’ll give my rationale, and I’ll turn it into a question to them. It really forces them to think a little deeper on whether that matters.

The paintings and journals in Vasily Vereshchagin’s “The Indian Poem” bring out our past vividly
History, through pictures, paintings and portraits, has an altogether different effect as it immediately triggers the imagination of the viewer making him/her feel the emotions and poignancy of the scene or situation or person depicted. Vasily Vereshchagin (1842-1904), the world renowned master of battle scene paintings, who ironically was a staunch pacifist, has the same result.
An album of 50 masterpieces and around 150 sketches on Indian themes, “Vasily Vereshchagin Indian Poet” was released last week jointly by Lokesh Chandra, President, Indian Council for Cultural Relations, and Alexander M. Kadakin, Ambassador of the Russian Federation to India, at a function at New Delhi’s Russian Centre of Science and Culture (RCSC) which held it jointly with the Embassy of the Russian Federation. The volume was dedicated to the upcoming visit to India of Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Chandra was the chief guest, Kapila Vatysyan, Chairperson, India International Centre — Asia Project, attended as the guest of honour.
The book is third in the series about the outstanding Russians who linked their scientific, creative and artistic paths with that of India. The first two been “Old India, Notes on Afanasy Nikitin’s Voyage beyond the Three Seas” (2010) a book by I.P. Minaev and an album “Prince Alexei Saltykov’s Journeys across India” (2012). They were 15th Century traveller and artist/writer respectively. Kadakin in his key-note address while mentioning the success of Festival of Russian Culture in India referred to the series and observed the objective was “to familiarise international community with the life and oeuvre of those eminent Russians who significantly contributed to the spiritual and artistic affinity and amity between the peoples of Russia and India.”
Drawing attention to the masterpieces, Kapila Vatsayan commented, “Paintings turned out to be the rarest of the rare assets of the artistic heritage in general cutting across all barriers of the world.”
The publication has unique travel journals which have been translated into English for the first time. Ferina Duggan-Polichtchouk who translated the journals with her husband Alexandre Polichtchouk Duggan-Polichtchouk, said, “The artist’s works bring out the dress, customs, religious beliefs and day-to-day life of Indians.” She pointed out that he had made two trips to India, from 1874 to 1876 and then again from 1882 to 1883. The journals in the album deal with his journey in the Himalayan regions including Sikkim, Kashmir and Ladakh apart from paintings of the region. Besides, it also includes other paintings as well, some depicting battles, other portraits, landscapes, expressive faces, animals, architecture and so on. She described Vereshchagin’s art as “deep, soul-searching and filled with meaning much like Russian literature”.
The dignitaries who attended the function included Parakhat H. Durdyev, Ambassador of Turkmenistan, Ibrahim A. Hajiyev, Ambassador of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Samargul Adamkulova, Ambassador of the Kyrgyz Republic to India.

Lawyers for 9/11 suspects say CIA interrogation report could help their casesBy Dan Lamothe December 10, 2014 Follow @danlamothe

The release of the Senate report on the CIA’s interrogation program has threatened to further delay the trial of the alleged co-conspirators in the Sept. 11 attacks, providing their attorneys with new leverage to demand the release of still-classified documents.
If the men are ultimately found guilty by a military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the details of their brutal treatment at the hands of CIA interrogators could be used to argue against the imposition of the death penalty, according to experts in military law and defense attorneys.
The report provided details that are relevant in the cases of Khalid Sheik Mohammed and four others who are accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks, as well as Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a Saudi who is before a military tribunal for his role in the 2000 attack in Yemen on the USS Cole. The six men have been held at Guantanamo Bay since they were transferred there from CIA prisons overseas in September 2006.
David Nevin, lead counsel for Mohammed, said Wednesday that defense attorneys in the case have struggled to gain access to details about the CIA prisons that the U.S. government has kept classified. The release of the report “breaks that down to a degree,” he said.
“This is a capital case, and one of the aspects of the U.S. Supreme Court’s jurisprudence in capital cases is that defendants have to be given access to all the information in the possession of the government that might argue for a lesser sentence,” Nevin said. “The fact that these men were tortured in my view precludes the imposition of the death penalty on them as a matter of a law.”
James Connell, the attorney for another 9/11 suspect, Ammar al-Baluchi, said he and other defense attorneys already had sought the release of the full, classified 6,682-page report prepared by the Senate Intelligence Committee. The government has resisted that thus far, but the committee released a 528-page executive summary Tuesday, and chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said the full document could be declassified and released at a later time.
The executive summary described the torture of some detainees, including repeated waterboarding, forced rectal rehydration and feeding, sleep deprivation and threats made on their lives of relatives. The CIA said the tactics were legal and necessary to gather essential intelligence that led to the thwarting of terrorist plots and the capture or killing of major terrorist suspects, including Osama bin Laden. The Senate committee report, in a detailed examination of CIA claims, said the program did not provide unique intelligence that can be directly tied to the foiling of individual plots.

There is a “shocking amount of detail” in the executive summary released Tuesday, Connell said, but it “kind of acts as a teaser for everything else” that is in the full report.
A spokesman for the Defense Department on military commissions, Lt. Col. Myles B. Caggins III, said the issue is still part of ongoing litigation, and the government “continues to work to ensure that all relevant and material information to military commission proceedings regarding the Rendition, Detention and Interrogation program is obtained and provided.”
“The full report, which remains classified, is the work product of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and while the Committee has provided some limited copies to the Executive Branch, any use of the full report by the military commission and the parties will be determined through the discovery process and through appropriate court filings,” Caggins said.
Eugene Fidell, a professor of military justice at Yale Law School, said the release of the report is a critical point in the cases against the 9/11 defendants. In rare circumstances, he said, legal cases can be dismissed if suspects are treated too harshly. Fidell said he doubted that would happen in the 9/11 case, but he said defense lawyers will certainly pursue additional details about the CIA’s treatment of their clients.
“This is a bonanza for the defense that they have an obligation to pursue,” Fidell said. “It’s not even discretionary. They have to pursue the vast amount of additional details that are out there.”
Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said the defense has a legitimate interest in seeing the material compiled in the interrogation report, given its “relevance to their client.”
But the government has long fought to separate periods of interrogation from criminal prosecutions, he said. He cited the 2007 conviction of Jose Padilla, a former Latin Kings gang member who received terrorist training at an al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan and was involved in what the Senate found was a far-fetched plan to build a “dirty bomb” and detonate it in Washington.
Turley represents Ali al-Tamimi, who was convicted in 2005 of inciting terrorism through the so-called Virginia Jihad Network. He was accused of encouraging followers to join the Taliban and fight American troops. Turley has sought additional classified information in that case, and been denied, he said.
“These cases have left a disturbing legacy where jurors are given sanitized records that omit references to torture and abuses,” Turley said. “The duality of these cases is highly damaging to our standing in the world. The suppression of evidence of torture has left the country open to charges of hypocrisy and artificiality in our legal system.”

The e-mail exchange got loads of attention after getting published by Boston.com  on Tuesday.
In his e-mails to Ran Duan of the Sichuan Garden and the Baldwin Bar, Ben Edelman, an associate professor at the elite business school , demanded a $12 refund, citing the “Massachusetts consumer protection statute, MGL93a, wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations.” It is, Edelman wrote, “a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price.” He noted that he had referred the matter “to applicable authorities.”
After having seen the matter referred to the court of public opinion, where he has not fared particularly well, Edelman now says he’s sorry for the hubbub.
In an apology   posted Wednesday afternoon on his Web site , Edelman wrote: “Having reflected on my interaction with Ran, including what I said and how I said it, it’s clear that I was very much out of line. I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation. Clearly I failed to do so. I am sorry, and I intend to do better in the future.”
Edelman, who is an attorney in addition to a professor, said that he’s reached out to Duan and plans to personally apologize to him.
Duan manages the bar inside Sichuan Garden’s Woburn location, a restaurant his parents opened in Brookline in the 1990s, according to Boston.com. In his e-mails to Edelman, Duan apologized for the outdated prices on the restaurant’s Web site.
Things got out of hand after that, with requests for refunds and arguments over the disclaimer on the restaurant Web site.
It seemed … a bit much.
“I personally respond to every complaint and try to handle every situation personally,” Duan told Boston.com. “I have worked so hard to make my family proud and to elevate our business.”
The e-mail exchange with Edelman “just broke my heart,” he said.
After the Boston.com story was published, embarrassed Harvard Business School students set up a fundraising page for the Greater Boston Food Bank , noting that “negative stereotypes of Harvard and HBS were reinforced” by Edelman’s e-mails.
The professor’s apology came a day after he wrote to the Boston Globe  that he had reached out to town officials, who responded that “they wouldn’t be able to help.”
“I wonder how many consumers were overcharged before I flagged the issue and pressed the restaurant to remove the false statements on its Web site,” Edelman wrote to the Globe.
I wonder how many Harvard professors will cite state statutes when reviewing Chinese takeout orders. After this episode, probably none.

Ex-Madoff computer programmer gets two-and-a-half years in prison for fraud5
The five employees are among 15 people who have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. Madoff is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading guilty in 2009 to running a scheme that cost investors an estimated $17 billion or more in principal.
Prosecutors said the five employees knowingly propped up Madoff's fraud by creating fake documents and backdating trades.
Prosecutors said Crupi, who managed accounts purporting to have a $900 million balance in 2008, helped generate fictitious trading data presented to firm clients.
Prosecutors had sought more than 14 years in prison for Crupi, who was convicted of securities, conspiracy and other charges with the other four employees.
But Swain imposed a more lenient term, as she did in sentencing the other employees, a trend a prosecutor last week said set a bad precedent.
Daniel Bonventre, Madoff's former back office director, was sentenced last Monday to the longest prison term, 10 years.
Annette Bongiorno, Madoff's former secretary and later a manager, received six years in prison, while computer programmers Jerome O'Hara and George Perez received 2-1/2 years in prison each.
Prosecutors sought more than 20 years for Bonventre and Bongiorno and more than eight for Perez and O'Hara.
The defendants, who are expected to appeal, have said Madoff deceived them into believing the business was legitimate.
Crupi told Swain on Monday that she had believed Madoff, who had discouraged her from learning about the securities industry.
"Knowing my work played a part in carrying out this horrible scheme will cause me shame and remorse for the rest of my life," Crupi said.

ED questions Maran brothers in Aircel-Maxis money laundering caseRoche loses patent for osteoporosis drug in India
Taking forward the money laundering probe in the Aircel-Maxis deal, the Enforcement Directorate has questioned the Maran brothers – Dayanidhi and Kalanithi – in connection with its criminal case against them.
Sources said the investigators, early this week, recorded the statements of Dayanidhi, the former Telecom Minister, and his businessman brother Kalanithi here after they were issued notices in October this year.
“Both the Marans have been questioned and their statements recorded under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. They could be summoned again,” sources said.
The duo were questioned about their personal and official financial dealings and on specific charges related to the deal.
Some documents submitted by them are being scrutinised, they said.
Officials said the fresh questioning of the Marans was essential as the ED is expected to issue an attachment order for seizing of assets of an estimated value of over Rs 700 crore in this case and all questions regarding criminal actions had to be answered by those involved and booked, they said.
Other executives involved in the deal are also now being questioned, they said.
The ED is probing the case based on a CBI FIR in the matter.
Besides the Maran brothers, the CBI has named Malaysian business tycoon T Ananda Krishnan, Malaysian national Augustus Ralph Marshall and four firms – Sun Direct TV, Maxis Communication Berhad, Astro All Asia Network and South Asia Entertainment Holding – as accused.
The CBI has charged them with the offences punishable under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
The CBI had alleged in the court that Dayanidhi Maran had “pressured” and “forced” Chennai-based telecom promoter C. Sivasankaran to sell his stakes in Aircel and two subsidiary firms to Malaysian firm Maxis Group in 2006.
The ED’s money laundering case is based on this.

Mr Modi  please note: Queer people are standing up for their rightsGays, lesbians, transsexuals and their supporters hold placards as they participate in a Gay Pride Parade in New Delhi.
Dear Mr Modi,
 
I write to you today as we complete one year of the Supreme Court having rolled back basic human rights for a section of the population of a country you represent as Prime Minister. This day last winter, the highest court in the land upheld Section 377 of the Indian Penal code that criminalises any form of 'unnatural' sexual behaviour. The court's ruling meant that India's LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) people didn't deserve the right to live without fear of legal persecution since they made up only a minuscule minority of the population. It upheld a 150-year-old Victorian law that has been repealed in its parent country, saying it is the job of a majoritarian institution like the Parliament to confirm the fundamental rights of citizens, and not the court.
 
In this one year, I am proud to say Mr Modi, queer people have emphatically refused to go back into the closet and more people than ever have been out on the streets demanding their rights. Pride parades have marched not just in the metros, but in smaller cities like Baroda and Kochi. Schools and colleges have queer groups that are working towards gender and sexuality justice among the young generation. From literature to popular culture to cinema to music, queer people who have taken the centrestage have refused to fade into the background.
 
At the same time, Mr PM, what the court refused to understand was that a provision like Section 377 is a tool of coercion, blackmail and torture that denies basic dignity of existence for the queer community. That only 200 people have been booked under the section is irrelevant, because the presence of Section 377 renders underprivileged populations vulnerable to police oppression.
 
More than 800 cases of violence against transpeople and hijras have been registered since January alone. Last month, 167 transgenders in Bengaluru were picked up and put in a beggars colony arbitrarily and against their will. Rural regions also regularly report cases of harassed lesbians, transpeople ending their lives, unable to bear the pressure that a partriarchal society puts on them. From cities, reports about forced marriages falling apart--most recently from Bengaluru--must be fresh in your mind.
 
You've often talked about the importance of making society safe for women, but Mr PM, it's crucial to understand that the same patriarchal set-up that oppresses women also discriminates against queer people and inflicts violence against Dalit youth attempting inter-caste marriage, among others.
 
In your seven months in office, you have announced a raft of measures to resuscitate the economy, which you say is why the Indian public elected you. But India also elected you to uphold the Constitution and guarantee fundamental rights to all its people, regardless of how small a section they might constitute. What does GDP growth matter to the individual who has been denied the basic right to live with dignity by their own court and government? Is middle-class growth really more important?
 
This is to not say that there is no hope. The same Supreme Court's judgment recognising transgenders as a third gender has given new hope to the queer people that their voices aren't going unheard . As I write this, people are fighting for queer rights in court, on the roads, on the theatre stage, in cinemas, in academic spaces and in areas of daily work.
 
We are long past the stage where society thought LGBTQ people have to beg for their rights--we stand together with other underprivileged caste, class, gender, disability rights groups, fighting against oppression from both the state and the society. Our only hope is that you will acknowledge this fight and grant us what is our due.
 
You often talk about improving India's image in the world and so must be aware of the kind of criticism India receives for criminalising its own people. The countries whose economy you admire much also have robust pro-LGBT policies and I hope your government emulates them.
 
Earlier this year, you launched a Swachh Bharat campaign, where you aimed to clean India of visible filth. But dirt, Mr Modi, can also be invisible--the kind that pollutes our justice system, using the same institutions that are supposed to protect the vulnerable to oppress them. This is the filth of patriarchy, of a 1860 law that governs people's sexual and personal lives. Surely, sir, one cannot liberalise the economy without liberalising the mind?
 
Today, thousands of people across the country would be protesting against the Supreme Court decision--telling the judges that privacy, human dignity and the right to bodily integrity and sexual autonomy is non-negotiable.
 
We only hope that you take note of these demonstrations, and strike down the law. I know that the ideological parent of your party, the RSS, on whose rolls your name still figures, has very staunch views about queer people but please remember that as PM, you represent me as much as the homophobe bent on denying me my rights.
 
I hope, sir, that we never have to celebrate a second anniversary of the draconian judgment and either the government or the courts realise that Section 377 cannot be justified anymore. Because sir, history has made a choice on queer rights and the homophobes and oppressors are squarely on the wrong side.
 

Resentment and pep talk inside CIA after Senate torture reportResentment and pep talk inside CIA after Senate torture report

As outcry grows over its now-defunct brutal interrogation program, America's spy agency appears caught in the crossfire of debate over its methods in the ongoing US battle against Islamic militants and whether it has changed its ways.
Inside the Central Intelligence Agency, intelligence officials expressed resentment over what they said was the unfairness of a Senate Intelligence Committee report released on Tuesday that harshly criticized the spy agency's detention and questioning of militant suspects.
Video | Senate Report: CIA torture tactics crossed legal lines
As Senate Democrats urged more information about the program be made public and CIA officials be held accountable, CIA Director John Brennan was scheduled to speak privately to the agency's employees on Wednesday about the Senate report.
Brennan, who is close to US President Barack Obama, on Tuesday acknowledged the agency made mistakes, but rejected some key Senate panel findings, including its conclusion that harsh interrogation techniques did not produce valuable intelligence about militants that could not be obtained by other means.
"CIA is frequently asked to do difficult, sensitive and sometimes risky things on behalf of the country," a US intelligence official said. "Congress doesn't do massive studies of CIA's successful efforts such as preventing another massive casualty attack on the United States."
"The intellectual dishonesty of the (Senate) report will eventually be revealed and in the end CIA's position about the value of the detention and interrogation program will stand as the historical fact," the intelligence official said.
Countries that cooperated with the CIA's post-September 11, 2001 detention and interrogation program expressed dismay that its details became public.
"Who now in any form is going to want to continue cooperation in the fight with global terrorism and with opponents of our world view, democracy, in this domain when the system is so dramatically liable to leak?" Polish Deputy Prime Minister Janusz Piechocinski told Poland's TVN24 broadcaster.
Poland has acknowledged allowing the CIA to operate a secret interrogation center on its territory.
As details of the CIA program dribbled out over the years, the agency has faced Justice Department investigations - no  prosecutions materialized - and worried it would lose cooperation from allied intelligence services.
But even some who are sympathetic to the CIA say the agency bears the brunt of blame for the damage.
"It's just a self-inflicted wound of the worst kind," said former CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz.

Tug of war
In the continuing tug of war over the CIA program, retiring Sen. Mark Udall, Colorado Democrat, took to the US Senate floor to disclose findings of an earlier CIA review that he said backs up the Senate Intelligence Committee majority report.
The conclusions of the CIA study, known as the "Panetta Review" after former CIA director Leon Panetta, "fly directly in the face of claims made by senior CIA officials past and present," Udall said, urging its declassification.
He called for new legislation banning coercive interrogation techniques.
CIA officials have said the Panetta Review was not an investigation that reached conclusions, but merely a factual account of the program's history.
Significant new limits on the CIA's role and powers seem unlikely. Obama has placed the agency at the forefront of battling Islamic militants worldwide, including using armed drones.
Obama is known to rely heavily on the counsel of Brennan, formerly his top White House counter-terrorism advisor. And the CIA faces a more sympathetic Congress next year, when Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who was critical of the 'torture" report, replaces Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Could it happen again?
Obama in 2009 issued an executive order barring the CIA from operating detention facilities and conducting "enhanced interrogation."
The CIA on Tuesday said it had already taken steps to address issues raised in the report, including better management of sensitive programs and enhanced vetting of CIA officers who participate in them.
Philip Zelikow, who as a top State Department official in 2006 wrote a secret memo arguing some of the CIA techniques were unconstitutional, said the CIA's assurances were insufficient.
The Senate report "does raise some important issues regarding the management of covert activities," he said.
The report "will have for some time, and some time can mean for years, a chastening effect. But over time the agency does what it does," said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer who questioned prisoners after 2001.
"I think generations will forget," he said. "And the institution strives to serve the executive. And there will be mistakes again."

Oil Edges Up Toward $65, Traders See More Downside
Reuters | Updated On: December 11, 2014 18:51 (IST)
L&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
London: Oil edged higher on Thursday towards $65 a barrel helped by a weaker US dollar, although prices remained close to a five-year low on signs that already ample supply will be even more plentiful in 2015.
Crude prices sank on Wednesday as OPEC forecast an increasing supply surplus in 2015, US crude inventories unexpectedly rose and OPEC's most influential voice, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, shrugged off the need for an output cut.
North Sea Brent crude rose 63 cents to $64.87 by 1112 GMT, up from Wednesday's low of $63.56 - the weakest since July 2009. US crude, which also hit a five-year low on Wednesday, rose 48 cents to $61.42.
"Brent could be seeing a bit of short-covering and it could have quite a sharp rally after yesterday, but the market would still look just as bearish," said Christopher Bellew, a senior oil broker at Jefferies in London. "It would be unwise to say the market has marked the bottom."
Brent has fallen more than 40 per cent, or $50, from its 2014 high reached in June. Commerzbank, which cut its 2015 Brent price forecast to $73 a barrel from $82, also said it is too early to see an end to the losing streak.
"We may see some technical bounces, but it is too soon to speak of a sustainable price recovery," said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at the bank.
A slightly weaker dollar gave sentiment a boost in commodity markets. A weak dollar makes oil and other dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
OPEC said on Wednesday demand for its crude in 2015 would fall to its lowest in more than a decade, indicating a large supply surplus in 2015 without OPEC output cuts or a slowdown in the US shale boom.
The prospect of any OPEC cut remained slim as Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, on Wednesday questioned the need for one, sticking to his stance outlined at OPEC's meeting on November 27 despite a $13 drop in prices since then.
At the meeting, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies urged fellow OPEC members to combat the growth in US shale, which needs relatively high prices to be economic and has been eroding OPEC's market share, by resisting output curbs.

Uma Bharti slams opposition for not letting her speak on Ganga rejuvenationBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 3:38 pm
Union Minister Uma Bharti on Thursday slammed the opposition for not allowing her to speak in Lok Sabha on the issue of rejuvenation of Ganga and give details of the project due to disruptions in the House over alleged forced re-conversion in Agra.
The Minister for Water Resources River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation also accused the opposition of doing “nothing” on the issue for 10 years.
“There was an important question today, which I had been raising with the members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for the last two years and had brought them on the same page.
“When the issue of Ganga was raised, the Speaker was saying that this issue is related to Ganga and let her (Bharti) speak. If a bill on Ganga was to be introduced, it would have got passed without an opposition,” Bharti said.
The Minister was speaking to reporters outside the Parliament.
She, however, declined to give details of the project on the pretext that the question was yet to be answered before the House.
Attacking the Opposition over the issue, Bharti said, “The previous government did nothing on Ganga. The Prime Minister has acted so fast on the issue. Never has there been a case in the world that any Prime Minister constituted a ministry and it started functioning smoothly in six months. I wanted to give a brief of this in the Parliament.
“Even on the issue of Ganga, the opposition did not allow any discussion to take place,” she said.
When asked about the on-going row on religious re-conversion in Agra, she dodged the question saying that the matter is “beyond her purview to comment on.”

Russia to fully  Make in India  advanced helicopter | To supply 12 n-reactors to Indiahelicopters
(Modi also proposed that…)
NEW DELHI: In a major boost to India's defence sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a joint statement with Vladimir Putin a on Thursday said that Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters .
"Russia has been India's foremost defence partner through decades. Even as India's options have increased today, Russia will remain our most important defence partner," PM Modi said. "We have conducted joint exercises across all three wings of the Armed Forces in the last six months," he added.
Modi said that he discussed a broad range of new defence projects with Putin. "I am pleased that Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters. It includes the possibility of exports from India. It can be used for both military and civilian use. We will follow up on this quickly," Modi said. "We also discussed how to align our defence relations to India's own priorities, including Make in India," he added.

Modi also proposed that Russia should locate manufacturing facilities in India for spares and components for Russian defence equipment in India.
Noting that Russia has been India's foremost defence partner through decades, Modi said his first visit outside Delhi as Prime Minister was to new aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya - a ship bought from Russia.
"It sails our seas as a great symbol of our defence cooperation. Even as India's options have increased today, Russia will remain our most important defence partner," Modi said in his statement to the media after holding meeting with Putin.
In yet another major announcement, Russia has agreed to supply nuclear reactors to India. "Today, we have outlined an ambitious vision for nuclear energy of at least ten more reactors. It will have the highest standards of safety in the world. It will also include manufacture of equipment and components in India. This also supports our Make in India policy," Modi said.
"Energy security is critical for India's economic development and creating jobs for our youth. Russia is also a key partner in this area," he said. "I am pleased that the first unit of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant is on stream. It has added 20% to the existing capacity for nuclear power in India. We are on course for installing the next three units of 1000 MW each," Modi added.
Modi said, "The steadfast support of the people of Russia for India has been there even at difficult moments in our history. It has been a pillar of strength for India's development, security and international relations. India, too, has always stood with Russia through its own challenges."
"The character of global politics and international relations is changing. However, the importance of this relationship and its unique place in India's foreign policy will not change. In many ways, its significance to both countries will grow further in the future," he added.
In a joint statement released post Putin-Modi meeting, the two leaders said defence cooperation between India and Russia is founded on deep mutual trust and promotes wider peace and security.
"The two countries have already moved to a phase of joint design and development of defence systems. The sides recognize the virtually unlimited opportunities for enhancing this cooperation," the statement said.

Jasper Infotech, which owns online marketplace Snapdeal.com, on Thursday said it has acquired Noida-based Wishpicker.com, which provides gifting concepts matched to the receiver. The purchase amount was not disclosed.
Wishpicker was started in 2013 by IIT-Delhi graduates Apurv Bansal and Prateek Rathore. It advises users on the gifts they could give based on the receiver's age, personality and other factors.
Announcing the deal, Rohit Bansal, Snapdeal Co-Founder of Snapdeal.com said, “Our focus is to leverage technology to create life-changing experiences for buyers and sellers. We are investing in strengthening our technology platform."
Overall, this is Snapdeal's fifth acquisition. A few months back, Snapdeal acquired Doozton, a social product discovery technology platform, also for an undisclosed sum.
In October, the Delhi-based Snapdeal had raised $627 million (around Rs. 3,760 crore) from Japanese telecom and Internet major SoftBank, saying it was looking at three or four acquisitions related to mobile technology.
It took over Shopo in May 2013 and online sports goods seller Esportbuy before that.

Changing China trends focus in Guwahati Literary FestivalWritten by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati |
Posted: December 11, 2014 5:53 pm
Changing social and cultural trends in China with focus on writing will be one important focus area in the upcoming third Guwahati Literary Festival that will be held here in the last week of December.
Disclosing this here on Thursday, Assam Education Minister Pradyut Bordoloi said while the Northeast shares about 1280 kms of boundary with China, very little is discussed in the region about socio-cultural changes that are taking place in the neighbouring country. “It is very important for people to know what is happening in the neighbourhood, and writers can play a major role in disseminating information about them,” the minister said.
“The Guwahati Literary Festival is one opportunity where participants will listen to two eminent China scholars Prof Pushpesh Pant and Alka Acharya will be discussing about China. Rajen Saikia, former president of the Indian History Association will also take part in the discussion,” Bordoloi, who is also chairman of Assam Publication Board, which organizes the Festival, said.
China incidentally has figured prominently in several Assamese works of fiction, the first being Jnanpith award-winning author Birendra Kumar Bhattacharyya’s “Shataghni” written in the backdrop of the Chinese aggression of 1962. Five decades later Sahitya Akademi award winner Rita Choudhury came out with “Makam”, a novel that highlighted the plight of people of Chinese origin in the wake of the 1962 war with China.
The Guwahati Literary Festival, which will be held from December 27 to 29, will also have a session on reflection of the Second World War in literature in Assam, Nagaland and Manipur. The Northeast had become an important scene of the World War after the Allied Forces had retreated following intense Japanese attack in Burma (present-day Myanmar).
“People of the Northeastern region were witness to a crucial phase of the World War, especially with the Battle of Kohima now regarded as a turning point in world history. The War has figured prominently in Assamese and Manipuri literature, while writers like Easterine Kire of Nagaland and Siddhartha Sharma of Assam have written wonderful fiction in English woven around the Battle of Kohima,” minister Bordoloi said.
A galaxy of eminent writers like Mark Tully, Namita Gokhale, Jerry Pinto, Urvashi Butalia, Mitra Phukan, Arup Kumar Dutta, Sanjoy Hazarika, Robin Ngangom, Aruni Kashyap, Monalisa Changkija, Preeti Gill, CP Surendran, Janice Pariat, Dhrubajyoti Bora and Arnab Goswami are taking part in various sessions spread over the three days.

Average salary hikes likely to be at 11% in 2015: Mercer
With an average salary increase likely to be at 11 percent, the projected pay hike for next year in medical life sciences sector is the highest (12 percent) and for the shared services and hi-tech industry it is lowest (10 percent).
Post your opinion here
 
Indian companies are likely to keep average salary hikes muted at 11 per cent in 2015, with medical life sciences sector expected to dole out the highest pay raise, says a survey by global consultancy Mercer. According to Mercer's 'Total Remuneration Survey', the actual salary increase across industries and career levels for 2014 stood at 10.6 percent. With an average salary increase likely to be at 11 percent, the projected pay hike for next year in medical life sciences sector is the highest (12 percent) and for the shared services and hi-tech industry it is lowest (10 percent).
While the pay increases have been muted, a majority of companies have indicated aggressive recruitment activity in the next year on expectation of higher growth rate, the survey findings showed. The survey covered 700 organisations in the country across various industry sectors like medical life sciences, chemical, oil and gas, manufacturing and engineering, automobiles and auto components, shared services and hi-tech sector.
"Overall, the current pay increase forecasts indicate that while business sentiment is positive, companies await the sentiment to turn into actual business results before taking aggressive pay actions," Mercer India Business Leader (Information Solutions) Shanthi Naresh said. "In industry context, the organisation and specific roles are continuing to drive reward decisions," Naresh added.
Even companies which are forecasted to dole out lower than average salary hike "are using their discretion to differentiate and reward high performers with slightly higher pay increases in order to aid retention," Naresh said. Mercer also found that the overall actual attrition in 2013 across industries was 10.3 percent with the highest attrition in the hi-tech sector at 15 per cent. By comparison, attrition stood at 6.5 percent as on June 2014.
According to the survey, engineering, sales and research and development functions continue to remain the most difficult functions to hire and retain talent.

Capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has said that certain companies are continuing to mobilise funds from the public, defying a ban on them.
"it has been observed that certain entities collect money under existing or new schemes even after Sebi has directed the entity not to collect any further money, not to launch any new schemes etc, which is unauthorised and illegal," said the market regulator in a release cautioning investors.
Sebi asked investors to be careful of persons and entities offering returns that are much greater than those offered by regulated entities such as banks and mutual funds.
The market regulator said it had passed orders against 51 entities for operating collective investment schemes (CIS) without proper approvals.
Some of the companies barred from such fundraising by Sebi include MPS Greenery Developers, PACL and Rose Valley Real Estate.
The regulator said if these 51 entities are found to be collecting money, investors should report it to the authorities as well as the police. It advised investors to invest in schemes that are regulated by authorities like Sebi, insurance regulator Irda, pension regulator PFRDA and banking regulator RBI.
 

CAD comfortable despite widening  says Raghuram RajanCAD comfortable despite widening, says Raghuram Rajan
Reuters | Kolkata Dec 11, 2014 05:43 PM IST
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is comfortable with the Current Account Deficit (CAD) even after it widened in the July-September quarter, Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Thursday.
Still, Rajan, speaking at a news conference after the central bank's board meeting, said risks remain to the current account deficit even though he was not apprehensive about it.
India's current account deficit widened to 2.1% of gross domestic product in the July-September quarter, higher than both the previous quarter and a year earlier, the RBI said on Monday.
Turning to the economy, Rajan said an interest rate cut won't by itself lead to higher economic growth, although he noted it would have an impact.
Rajan also noted the central bank was in discussions with the government about reviewing priority sector lending norms for foreign banks operating in India, the governor said.
Turning to limits on foreign investments in government bonds, Rajan said it would look at raising the limit at an appropriate time, and would look at expanding it steadily.

At a time when India's current account deficit (CAD) has widened to $10.1 billion in the quarter ended September 2014, Reserve Bank of India Governor, Raghuram Rajan, allayed concerns saying, the central bank is still comfortable with the CAD at 2.1% of gross domestic product (GDP).
"Current account deficit has certainly widened. But still 2.1% is comfortable. The direction is something that we will be watching closely,” Rajan said at a news conference after the central bank's board meeting here.
“There are risks to the current account, there are risks to everything. At this point, we are certainly vigilant, but I won't say, we are apprehensive," he added.
A sharp rise in gold imports and a fall in export growth pushed India's current account deficit (CAD) to $10.1 billion (2.1% of gross domestic product) in the financial year's second quarter, ending September, compared to $5.2 bn (1.2% of GDP) for July-September 2013. The deficit was $7.8 bn (1.7% of GDP) in the first quarter ended June, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data.
“Gold imports have increased. The question is whether after liberalisation, imports will increase substantially more, or will they be near the actual demand in the economy,” he said.
According to Rajan, the falling oil price is a a cushion on CAD and it is about time to experiment by taking off the restrictions on gold imports.
“How long can we rely on that (falling oil prices) is a matter of uncertainty. But I'm also hopeful that people will turn towards investing in either deposits or bonds or even in the stock market as opposed to substantial use of gold as an investment,” he noted.

BS Reporter | Bhubaneswar Dec 11, 2014 07:04 PM IST
Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) has agreed to provide technical training to tribal youths in mineral bearing areas for engagement in mining and other activities, as part of the state government's skill development plans.
The proposal was first mooted by Department of Technical Education and Training (DTE&T). OMC agreed to implement the proposal under its corporate social responsibility (CSR) scheme.
"The proposal of DTE&T for hands-on apprenticeship training of 15 trainees each in mechanic earth-moving machinery and riggers trades who have completed one year basic training at government ITI, Barbil shall be conducted by OMC Ltd in its mining industries preferably in Keonjhar district by the end of December 2014," the state-run undertaking said in a letter to the steel and mines department.
It admitted that there is a need for skilled manpower in mining and allied sector and it needs to employ local unemployed youths.
"Government ITIs at Barbil, Anandpur and Talcher are in the process of introducing some trades in the mining sector during August 2015 session. These ITIs shall be supported with used heavy mining equipment and machineries by OMC Ltd for hand-on practice of the trainees," it said in the proposal.
OMC also has plans to provide light motor vehicles to impart driving trainings to youths in naxal affected areas of the state at selected government ITIs. Besides, it has plans to set up a model training school at Puri with an investment of Rs 25 crore for training in multiple sectors.
"The sector based skill training in manufacturing, mining and allied technology, automobile, tourism and hospitality, agro-mechanisation, entrepreneurial training, soft skill etc shall be implemented by providing training to graduates and other unemployed youth suitable for employment or self employment. The DTE&T shall prepare the detailed project report with financial requirement of Rs 25 crore for infrastructure like hostels and staff quarters etc," OMC said in its proposal report to the government.

Turkish actress trolled by  Islamists  for interpreting for PopeTurkish actress trolled by 'Islamists' for being the Pope's translator

A leading Turkish actress said she has been subjected to a welter of insults on social media since she acting as a translator for Pope Francis during his visit to Turkey in November.
 
Serra Yilmaz said she was "accused of being a Christian" by Islamist trolls, who were angry at the renowned actress agreeing to interpret for Francis.
 
"I was accused of being a Christian just because I acted as the translator of Pope Francis," Yilmaz told university students in the western port city of Izmir, Milliyet newspaper reported Thursday.
 
"It is ridiculous to judge people by their beliefs.
 
"But many people made groundless claims like 'the Vatican hired you,' or insulted me on social media," she said.
 
The 60-year-old stage and screen star, who is fluent in Italian, said she had been hired by Turkish foreign ministry to work as a translator during the pope's three-day visit to Ankara and Istanbul in late November.
 
Yilmaz, best known overseas for her roles in Italy-based Turkish filmmaker Ferzan Ozpetek's films, regularly works as a translator for Italian-speaking dignitaries and politicians visiting Turkey.
 
She had also worked as a translator for Pope Benedict XVI, Francis' predecessor, when he visited Turkey in 2006.
 
Yilmaz had drawn the ire of conservatives in Turkey -- run by an Islamist-rooted government for more than a decade -- when she famously said in 2012 that girls with headscarves scare her and they look like "monsters".
 
"Won't nuns scare Serra Yilmaz, who said headscarved girls look like monsters?" a Twitter user with the handle @hamdiaydinn wrote, while another suggested "it is now clear she is a missionary".
 
While Turkey is run on strictly secular lines, the vast majority of its 76-million inhabitants are Muslim. Turkey's Christian community is no more than 120,000-strong, most of them Greek Orthodox or Armenian.

Bengal dy speaker assaults apartment residentBengal dy speaker assaults apartment resident
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Kolkata, December 11, 2014

Deputy Speaker of West Bengal assembly and Trinamool leader Sonali Guha was caught on camera threatening and manhandling the president of an apartment's residents' association in Howrah.
This incident come days after another Trinamool leader, Abu Ayesh Mondal, beat up a toll plaza employee after being asked to pay toll.
Guha is seen calling herself "the chief minister" and "the government" while threatening Dr Nagender Rai of evicting him from his flat and locking it up over a non-functional elevator of the building.
The incident happened early on Thursday morning.
"I'm the chief minister. I'm the government. Don't forget it," Guha is heard saying while threatening residents of the apartment with dire consequences.
"Don't speak too much or I will lock up your flat from outside tomorrow. No one will be able to open the lock," she is also heard saying in the footage being aired on local television channels.
CCTV footage also showed a woman thrashing the doctor with slippers.
Guha said she had rushed to the apartment to settle a dispute involving a family that has a pregnant woman and wanted to use the lift at that time to take her to a hospital. According to the building association regulations, the lift does not operate after 11pm.
On Thursday, Guha asserted that as woman she had done the right thing and went there as a Trinamool worker.
"I went there as a mother to save another would-be mother. I did nothing wrong. I only said the person was going too far," said Guha.
She alleged Rai and his family were BJP supporters and were trying to make a political issue out of it.
"I am not a deputy speaker 24x7. I'm a human being when I'm not a deputy speaker. I went there to solve a crisis created by some BJP men," she added.
She also claimed the family of the doctor had unleashed a reign of terror in the apartment.
Asked whether her action would embarrass her party and her leader, Guha said, "No. The chief minister asked me to keep calm and quiet while appointing me as the deputy speaker. I have done exactly the same over the past three years."
Guha, an old aide of chief minister Mamata Banerjee, has a reputation of abusing political opponents and government officials, even to the
extent of slapping people. She once called a police officer a swine after barging into the police station and locking up another.
Rai's family has lodged a complaint at Golabari police station.

CM Jitan Ram Manjhi calls for raising reservation limit to 80%By: Press Trust of India | Motihari |
Posted: December 11, 2014 8:14 pm
Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi on Thursday called for raising the bar on reservation from present 49.5 per cent to 80 percent for OBCs, SC/STs and other sections of the population.
“The reservation (in government jobs and educational institutions) be hiked to 80 per cent to be in sync with the population benefiting from the incentive,” he told a public meeting during his civic reception at Banshidhar secondary school under Adapur block in Bihar’s east Champaran district.
The number of people (OBCs, SC/STs and other sections) benefitting from reservation system stood at 80 per cent of total population of Bihar, Manjhi said and mooted for reservation limit (at 49.5 per cent) to be raised to 80 percent to meet employment and educational aspirations of the
beneficiaries.
The Chief Minister, who himself hails from a Mahadalit Mushar caste, said he would work for building a consensus on the issue with like-minded parties and, if needed, may launch an agitation to press for the reservation bar to be raised to 80 per cent.
Manjhi said he has taken upon himself to build a consensus on the issue with like minded parties and spearhead a stir in this regard, if required.
He urged lawmakers of different parties to demand for raising reservation limit in the current winter session of Parliament.
Manjhi alleged the NDA government was discriminating against Bihar and claimed the state plan size as well as funds under the MNREGA, IAY and BRGF have been slashed considerably to derail development and welfare activities in the state.

58 Indian fishermen arrested in Pakistan for violating territorial watersBy: Press Trust of India | Karachi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 8:03 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 8:17 pm
Fifty eight Indian fishermen were arrested on Thursday and their 11 boats seized by Pakistani authorities for allegedly violating the country’s territorial waters.
The Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (MSA) arrested them in the the Arabian Sea.
“They violated the territorial waters in the Arabian Sea despite several warnings by our patrol boats,” Ahmed Reza, an official with the agency, said.
He said the MSA had also seized 11 boats and handed over the arrested fishermen to the docks police.
“The fishermen will now be presented before a magistrate and can be sent to judicial custody,” a police official said.
Last month Pakistan had arrested 61 Indian fishermen and seized 11 boats and these fishermen are now languishing in Malir district central jail.
Ayub Khoso, a senior official of the Pakistan Fishermen Forum, said that it was time that the governments of Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka find a permanent solution to a major problem affecting the livelihood of the fishermen.
“The arrest of fishermen has now become a frequent matter in Indian, Pakistani and Sri Lankan territorial waters. In the absence of any clear demarcation in the Arabian Sea these poor fishermen don’t know where they are headed and land into jails in these countries,” Khoso said.
He said their boats also lacked the required modern technology for accurate navigation in the Arabian Sea specially at night.
Pakistan and India also release each other’s fishermen on regular basis.
Last month, Pakistani authorities released 35 Indian fishermen and a civilian from Malir jail while in May this year a total of 151 Indian fishermen were released as a goodwill gesture.
Relations between the two nations have been tense in recent times due to frequent violations on the Line of Control.

U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as crude oil prices continued their descent, but the S&P closed out a third straight year of double-digit gains.
For the year, the Dow ended up 7.5 percent, notching its sixth straight annual gain, and the Nasdaq rose 13.4 percent. The best-performing S&P component in 2014 was Southwest Airlines Co  up 124.6 percent, while Transocean Ltd , down 62.9 percent, was the worst.

Equities lost steam heading into the New Year after rallying nearly 6 percent over eight sessions, sparked by the U.S. Federal Reserve's commitment to be "patient" about raising interest rates and positive economic data.
Still, the S&P 500 has risen in seven of the past ten sessions, hitting a series of intraday and closing records, and finished the year up 11.4 percent. The stock market will be closed Thursday.
"The fact of the matter is markets put in a solid year in spite of significant headwinds that could have easily derailed a multi-year bull market," said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.

"The most the bears got out of this year was a 10 percent correction on an intraday basis and the markets stubbornly moved higher, and for good foundational reasons."
Gains may be tougher to come by next year, and a pick-up in profits growth may be essential if the market is to continue to add to its historic gains.
Action in the energy space was once again a focus for investors. U.S. crude oil  settled down 85 cents at $53.27 a barrel, its lowest since May 2009. Brent  settled down 57 cents to $57.33.
The S&P Energy index <.SPNY>, easily the worst performing sector of the year with a decline of 10 percent, lost 0.8 percent Wednesday. Diamond Offshore  fell 3.6 percent to $36.71 and Noble Corp  fell 2.8 percent to $16.57.
The CBOE volatility index <.VIX>, which measures the cost of protection against a drop on the S&P 500, surged 20.4 percent, its biggest jump since Dec. 10 and the fourth straight climb. Quarterly options on the S&P 500 expire at the end of the month.
"Part of it may be the quarterly expiration of S&P options but a lot of it has to do with crude being down today," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at retail brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.
Traders might be also looking to load up on some protection before they head out for the holiday, Kinahan said.
"We had such a nice year that many people may be looking to buy some protection for a 'just-in-case scenario' for between now and the new year," Kinahan said.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 160 points, or 0.89 percent, to 17,823.07, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 21.45 points, or 1.03 percent, to 2,058.9 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 41.39 points, or 0.87 percent, to 4,736.05.
Volume was light, with about 5.21 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.95 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.
Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE 2,000 to 1,105, for a 1.81-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,571 issues fell and 1,194 advanced for a 1.32-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 35 new lows.

Gold price still in a long-term downtrendTweet
 
Tags: Gold ,  Gold prices in India ,  Gold price ,  Gold rates ,  Gold downtrend ,  Gold international rates ,  Gold imports ,  Gold outlook
Pic Courtesy: -
Two consecutive closings above Rs 27,000 will be bullish reversal and in this condition we can expect the yellow metal to rise towards Rs 27,600-Rs 27,900/ten gms.
In an interview with Ajeet Kumar of Zee Media Corp, Rajiv Kapoor, Head Commodities, Trustline shares his views on gold price trend, investment and outlook.
If government imposes new import restriction norms (mainly gold import duty/currently import duty on gold is at 10 percent), how will it impact the gold prices?
See, the government is aiming to discourage Indians to block their investment into gold that will not only the authorities in keeping the current account deficit (CAD) under control but would also contribute majorly towards productivity.
If the government decides to further hike import duty, it will make gold expensive in the hands of Indians but internationally it will be perceived negatively.
Will the new import restriction norms create supply crunch and add more premiums to gold in domestic market?
Of course! Further tightening of import norms will create shortage in physical market and accelerate the premiums domestically over international markets.
We are currently in a downtrend market. Will the current downtrend sustain in the days to come?
It is a very important and difficult question to answer. Anyway, we can evaluate few things as we have already seen major price destruction in gold prices internationally in last three years. Gold made its all time high in September 2011 by hitting a level of USD 1920, since then, prices have eroded 40 percent of its value. This indicates that gold is in clear downtrend.
If you see, dollar is consistently rising on the back of strong US economy numbers and discouraging investors to invest in gold. This is clearly reflecting in SPDR’s (world’s largest gold ETF) holdings, which are at seven year lows now.
Is a deeper retracement or a rebound ahead for the yellow metal?
Gold has already given decent bounce back from USD 1130 to USD 1200. Now, prices are waiting for further triggers which will decide the trend. See, in spite of strong US GDP numbers, gold is holding around USD 1200. However, for further rally, it has to sustain above USD 1210. In case prices are able to sustain above USD 1210, we can expect it to move towards USD 1250-USD 1260.
What is your outlook for gold price in the near to medium term? (both domestic as well international)
Two consecutive closings above Rs 27,000 will be bullish reversal and we can expect it to rise towards Rs 27,600-Rs 27,900/grams. Internationally, in case prices are able to sustain above USD 1210, we can expect it to move towards USD 1250-USD 1260.
Do you believe gold is still an effective way to preserve capital?
Yes, especially when riskier assets like equities are heading towards new highs.
Can you suggest some long-term reasons why it’s still a good idea to invest in gold now?
Ideas are simple as gold is always perceived as safe haven investment, best hedging tool against inflation and it also provides protection against any kind of natural, political or economic surprise or uncertainty.
In your view, what are the three biggest downside risks to gold right now?
Consistent strength in USD, lower inflation and gradual recovery in global economies. In India, there is a special risk of sudden reduction in import duty which is currently looking impossible for at least another six months.
What are the three biggest upside triggers to gold right now?
1.Further increase in import duty by Indian government will make gold expensive for Indians.
2. China's economic situation is looking little fragile which may compel the government there to take initiatives to further stimulate the economy. This can extend support to gold prices.
3. Weakness in USD against other currencies as the green back is trading at quite higher level.
Is it the right time to invest in gold?
Gold price has already seen significant correction internationally from USD 1920 to USD 1130. Although, long-term trend is still looking very weak, but bounce back in prices can be expected towards USD 1300 to USD 1320, which comes 25 percent of the fall from USD 1920 to USD 1130.
What's the best way to invest in gold now? Physical buying/gold savings fund/ ETFs/ futures/ others?
Physical buying or ETF are good alternatives.
Will gold prices below the level of USD 1,000 per ounce sustain in future? Will mining and production be viable at that level?
Gold prices below USD 1000 per ounce will be possible once it breaks and sustains below USD 1130 (which its recent lows). Gold mining cost is somewhere between USD 1000-USD 1100, thus prices near or below USD 1100 could mean production cutbacks.

Want The Hot Toys This Year You May Be Too LateWant the hot toys this year? You may be too late
Beth Pinsker Reuters
Email
If you still have Disney's Frozen Castle and Ice Palace Playset on your holiday gift list this year, you may already be out of luck. 
With Christmas approaching, the $119 toy - made by Mattel Inc - is sold out. Of course, you can find it at resellers for about $225 and even as high as $700 on eBay. There are still plenty of other Frozen-themed toys available - but only for now. 
Richard Drew / AP
This Oct. 1, 2014 photo shows Disney's Frozen Castle & Ice Palace Playset at the TTPM Holiday Showcase, in New York.
Industry analysts, poring over results from the Thanksgiving holiday week, say the hottest 25 toys have already hit their price lows and will only get more expensive as Christmas nears and the remaining inventory flies off stores' shelves. 
The silver lining? Retailers made a huge bet on toy inventory this holiday season - ordering twice as many shipments of Legos as last year, for instance, according to research firm Panjiva. 
Expect fierce price competition at major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, which carry thousands of toys, notes Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of Time to Play Magazine . 
"There will be huge promotions going on," he predicts. 
The sales will not be nationwide shopping events like Black Friday, but will pop up sporadically, culminating in major sales on Dec. 20, the Saturday before Christmas which experts expect to be an extremely heavy shopping day. 
"One by one, either loudly or quietly, they will be rolling out some amazing deals," says Panjiva CEO Josh Green. 
Video: ToyPortfolio.com’s Stephanie Oppenheim joins TODAY with some young toy testers to discuss some of hot tech toys and games on shelves, including the Kidizoom Smartwatch and the LeapBand.
Early Birds Get Hot Toys
Consumers love sales, but Silver notes they may be very disappointed if they can't find the hottest toys. 
Besides the sold-out Frozen Castle, there are 12 to 15 items which are currently hard to find, including the Max Tow Truck. It is listed currently around $128 on Amazon.com, depending on color - well above its list price of $59.99. Another hot item is the Imaginext Supernova Battle Rover - currently available for $109.99 at Toys R Us, slightly below the list price of $119. 
There are also about 25 to 30 toys that will sell out in the next two weeks, Silver says, especially the most popular new toys in the Lego, Barbie, My Little Pony, FurReal Friend and Nerf lines. 
Toys with a movie or popular culture tie-in drive demand, while interactive pets tend to be short-lived fads (think Zhu Zhu Pets or Furby). 
"There are clear bets by retailers - orders for Frozen toys and My Little Pony toys are up massively versus 2013," said Green. 
Most hot toys hit their price lows on Cyber Monday, according to data firm MarketTrack. This year, for example, the FurReal Friend Get Up & GoGo dog, which has a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $59.99, was being offered for $49.99 at most stores in early November. It went down to $39 just before Thanksgiving and hit $27 on Amazon on Cyber Monday. 
The very next day, the dog, which responds to commands from a remote-control leash, was back up to $39. The price is now fluctuating at most stores because of limited supply. 
Similarly, the My Little Pony Friendship Rainbow Kingdom Playset, which lists at $39.99, was on sale for $35 at Target on Black Friday and bottomed out at $19.99 on Cyber Monday on Amazon for a half-price sale. It is now back up to $34 at Wal-Mart and Toys R Us. 
What should shoppers do if they want the hottest toys? 
"Grab the hot items early and then get bargain toys when you can," Silver says. But you may have to wait until next year to employ this strategy.

"The positive sentiment can be gauged by the fact that global real estate funds focused on India are seeking to raise $ 6 billion in new capital, on top of $ 1.6 billion raised in the first seven months of 2014; most of this is aimed at residential projects,’’ the report said adding that there had been a significant rise in interest from large sovereign and foreign institutional players over the course of 2014.
Consequently, the report said the rankings of Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore had improved significantly from that of last year in the list of investment destinations. This year Mumbai is at 11th position (23rd in 2013) while Delhi was at 14th (21st in 2013) and Bangalore was at 17th position (20th in 2013).
"There is certainly a positive vibe complemented by the expectation of an improved economy and a more transparent environment, keeping interest levels up among investors,’’ Gautam Mehra, partner, PwC India, said in a statement.
In this backdrop, the position of excess liquidity across various jurisdictions which is pointed towards real estate augurs well for Indian markets. "Additionally, the expected developments around creation of a series of `smart cities’ focused on large scale manufacturing and the roll out of REITs (real estate investment trusts), if implemented well, are expected to further add to the momentum. The outcome of large volumes in e-commerce is likely to translate in demand for large scale logistics and warehousing space,’’ Mr. Mehra added.
The report said the top five investment markets for 2015 in Asia were Tokyo, Jakarta, Osaka, Sydney and Melbourne.

5 Reasons Shopping at Walmart Makes You a Scrooge This Holiday Seasonreddit
It's no secret that Walmart is the nation's largest retailer and that the family who owns Walmart, the Waltons, are mega-billionaires worth more than $144.7 billion , but what you might not know is that Walmart is the the largest private employer in the United States employing over 1.3 million workers.
Employing this many workers may make the company seem virtuous and altruistic, but the business model is not a model other companies should emulate. The middle class is struggling economically today because of the corporate practices and loop-holes that Walmart has established as an industry standard. This holiday season, when you're looking for the most sought after gifts -- avoid shopping at Walmart. Below you'll find the top five reasons why if you shop at Walmart this holiday season you're pretty much a Scrooge.
1. Walmart doesn't support American business.
While the company proudly boasts and encourages shoppers to "Buy American," the majority of the company's goods are made outside of the United States and often made in sweatshops . When you buy something at Walmart, you are not buying American.
2. Walmart creates more poverty than jobs.
When a Walmart store comes to town --  it isn't the economic golden child the company's PR machine would like you to believe. In fact, a study done by the Northwest Community group estimates that a Walmart opening up in a local town will actually decrease the community's economic output over 20 years by an estimated $13 million . It also estimates that Walmart will cost the community an additional $14 million in lost wages for the next 20 years. This translates to communities being worse off in the long run when Walmart strolls into town. When you shop at Walmart, you are not creating jobs.
3. Walmart's jobs are poverty jobs.
This year numerous studies released expose Walmart's poverty wages and the corporation's willingness to place that burden on taxpayers -- not the company. A report by Wisconsin's Democrats looked at how to quantify Walmart's cost to taxpayers in that state. At a minimum, Walmart workers in the state rely on at least $9.5 million a year to subsidize medicaid for workers. If these poverty level wages were raised to $10.10 an hour it would create 100,000 new jobs in the overall Wisconsin economy, not to mention adding another $13.5 billion to the overall economy. When you shop at Walmart you support poverty wages.
4. Walmart fires workers illegally.
Walmart has a long history of violating workers' rights far beyond mistreatment. The National Labor Relations Board found that Walmart has violated the rights of workers by "unlawfully threatened, disciplined, and/or terminated employees" for "having engaged in legally protected strikes and protests" and "in anticipation or response to employees' other protected concerted activities." In essence  --  Walmart not only encourages its managers to bully employees who want to speak out about unfair practices, they will also fire you if they find out you're planning a strike. When shopping at Walmart you support their anti-worker practices.
5. Walmart is a JOB KILLER.
We've touched on how Walmart promotes itself as a company that values made-in-America products while their products on its shelves are largely produced overseas and in sweatshops. We've highlighted how Walmart relies on subsidies by the federal government to legally pay their workers poverty wages. We've even exposed Walmart for illegally firing its workers who plan to strike or threatening their jobs to keep the workers from speaking out. All of this adds up to Walmart costing us an estimated 196,000 jobs --  many of them manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2006. To prove the power Walmart has in the job market  -- each store opened destroys almost three local jobs for every two it creates. When you choose to shop at Walmart you don't create jobs.
We're not alone in reconsidering our Walmart shopping habits. A recent blog on Daily Kos pointed out that a poll by Lake Research Partners found that Walmart's reputation is suffering among consumers with 28 percent saying they have an unfavorable view of Walmart compared to just 13 percent for Target and just 6 percent for Costco. This large unfavorable view is having an impact on Walmart's most loyal customer base, who in the same poll, said they have decided to shop their less because of the mega-retailer's reputation.
All of this adds up to you having the power to make a difference for retail workers across the country. If you, like all of us at Brave New Films, avoid shopping at Walmart this holiday season, you'll send a strong message to the retailer that workers' rights and living wages are more important to you than a few extra dollars in savings.

Special report: At Stanford  venture capital reaches into the dorm0
For VCs, the attraction of academia is simple: Some of the hottest tech start-ups are founded by college kids. Student-run firms that met venture capital backers at Stanford include Snapchat, the photo-sharing service. Chief executive Evan Spiegel dropped out two years ago to work on the venture. His first VC backer, Jeremy Liew, is a Stanford alumnus.
Perhaps most famously, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were Stanford graduate students. They met their first investor through an introduction from Professor David Cheriton, who also ended up investing.
Some on campus find the industry's reach troubling. The students' focus on doing business, they say, distracts from the scholarly mission of college and opens up instructors to potential conflicts of interest. The venture money also provides a temptation to drop out.
"VCs can be a bad influence and are not a good role model for students," says Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow at Stanford's Rock Center for Corporate Governance. Faculty members who aren't venture capitalists counter that VCs provide invaluable real-world insights.
Stanford's graduation rates have dipped somewhat in recent years. Of students who enrolled in 2009, 90 percent had graduated within five years, Stanford said, compared with a five-year graduation rate of 92.2 percent five years earlier. Some students say they are quitting to start companies. Stanford says it doesn't track the reasons students leave.
Reuters asked Stanford President John Hennessy whether there would be a conflict of interest if a Stanford instructor offered a student an implicit incentive, in the form of venture cash, to leave school.
"It's clearly at some level a conflict," says Hennessy. "It's not a direct conflict, but it is a worrisome issue."
Late last year, the university introduced a formal policy to govern faculty investments in student companies. If a faculty member has direct involvement in the student's academic program, the investment requires approval, including from the vice provost and dean of research.
The new policy states "The strong presumption is that such involvement would constitute a significant conflict of interest that could not be mitigated or managed and that it would therefore not be permitted." It applies only to people with full-time positions.
A Stanford spokeswoman said no requests for approval have been made by faculty members.
Some investor-professors bristle at the notion they are buttressing their portfolios with projects from current students. The vast majority of junior students stick around to earn their degrees, and most don't start companies, they point out. At the School of Engineering, the department that has done the most to welcome venture capitalists in roles such as instructor, adviser or guest lecturer, faculty members say VCs serve a valuable pedagogical purpose.
"If someone wants to go deep, getting a practitioner like a venture capitalist to talk about what they do works," says Tom Byers, an engineering professor and director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. "Every instructor invites a venture capitalist into their classroom in that vein."
PLUGGED IN
A career in venture capital normally follows years of entrepreneurial success. Barber, the young Stanford student, got into the game early after a chance encounter at a conference.
The lanky Australian computer science major had been drawn by Stanford's reputation as an entrepreneurial hotbed. But after enrolling in the autumn of 2012, he became disenchanted with the focus on consumer companies he saw among fellow students. Inventions such as smartphone apps struck him as frivolous, relatively easy to get off the ground and creating uncertain value.
Ideas for companies geared to serving businesses, by contrast, seemed to struggle to take flight. Their founders could use an experienced entrepreneur to guide them, he decided, as well as more mutual support.
That summer he crashed a conference given by 500 Startups, a popular program for entrepreneurs. At lunch, he found himself sitting next to Matt Mochary, a 46-year-old who started a technology-services company in the 1990s and was now involved in the early-stage funding known as "angel" investing.
Mochary learned Barber was couch-surfing and invited Barber to stay with him and his family. As he got to know Mochary, Barber decided the former technology executive could take on the role of adviser to students who wanted to create business-oriented companies.
"The original idea was to meet a bunch of people students could go work with," says Barber. "To have a network of people." In turn, Barber let Mochary in on the earliest stage of companies imaginable - when they amount to little more than a dorm room bull-session. Mochary offered Barber a deal: The Stanford junior could invest up to $10,000 of Mochary's cash on his own. Larger investments required Mochary's approval. Barber would get 10 percent of any returns.
Barber was to invest in two businesses set up by his room-mates: NeoReach, a marketing firm founded by Leimgruber; and an identity-verification company, BlockScore. Most enterprise startups take at least a couple of years to get off the ground, but he and Mochary say interest from bigger institutional investors in their startups is promising.
By late last year, Barber had convinced Mochary to come coach his classmates. The two launched an informal course, Focus.VC, which they taught from January to April. Mochary presented major concepts such as time management and business development. Barber mastered specialized software and other startup tools, so he could help novice entrepreneurs with specifics like payroll.
At the course's end, many of the students pitched to professionals, including representatives from several top Silicon Valley firms brought in by Mochary. Four of seven companies that presented raised money from investors. Another Focus.VC and Griffin House company, BlockScore, lined up funding days beforehand.
The young entrepreneurs attributed the program's success to the coaching they got and to Mochary's Silicon Valley contacts.
"Every actual problem you'll have, he'll open up his network," says Leimgruber. Mochary put in a good word for him with Founder.org, a seed fund that specializes in student-run startups. It eventually invested, drawn by Mochary's reference and the accomplishments of the founders, said Tony Ayaz, chief revenue officer at Founder.

10 Simple Actions to Achieve Massive Success in 2015reddit
Another year is coming to an end, and many of us are asking: "Did I achieve my goals this year  -- professionally and personally?"
2014 may have been a slow year, or it could have been one of the best years yet. Either way, there's always a way to push our limiting beliefs, and raise above the status quo.
Here are 10 simple actions you can take to achieve massive success in 2015.
1. Set specific results-driven goals, then reverse engineer them
This is the first step you should be taking that will set the foundation of actions moving forward. Get specific with your goals, or it won't get done.
For example: if you want to make $1M in 2015, you need to reverse engineer how much income that requires each month, and even each week.
More than that, how many sales do you need to make that happen. How many clients, and at what rate?
In order to make $1M in 2015, you need to have $83,333 of sales a month and $19,231 a week. Let's say you're selling a digital product for $47. In order to make $1M, you'll need to sell 1,773 of your product a month, and 410 a week. *note: this is not including taxes, and your expense for the sake of simple math*
Now that you know the specific numbers to reach your goals, you need to plan the proper actions that will get those results, and become ruthless at hitting those numbers. How many leads do you need according to your conversion rate? How much traffic do you need to get those leads? What are the marketing activities you need to make that happen?
This is the best way to face reality head on.
2. Keep a daily journal
Everyday, something new enters our mind that could have a massive impact for our future. We need to write not only new ideas down, but record our thoughts to track our progress and emotional state.
James Altrucher recommends writing down 10 new ideas a day, and soon you'll become an idea machine.
3. Invest in a coach
This is probably the most impactful decision you can make. Getting a coach to work with you is going to create massive change and momentum in your life. This could be a business coach, relationship coach, health coach  --  whichever area you're looking to get results in, investing in a coach will get it done.
Don't be afraid to pay a premium for a premium coach. You pay for what you get, and a premium coach will deliver premium results in your life.
4. Join a mastermind
A few months ago, I joined a mastermind of online entrepreneurs and it has already changed my life. There's nothing like bringing together a small, supportive community of like-minded, and talented people looking to make a difference together.
I cannot stress this enough. Join a mastermind. It will change your life.
5. Start a blog
Whether you're a business owner, entrepreneur, or a freelancer, you need to get the word out somehow. If you want to build your personal brand, attract more leads/sales, and become a trustful authority in your industry, building a blog is one of the best ways to achieve these.
You can take a free 7-day course on growth blogging, get started now.
6. Quit one bad habit every month
Picking up a bad habit often limits us more than adopting a good habit.
Take this challenge and commit to getting rid of one bad habit every month.
Start by writing down a list of your top 12 bad habits. It could be going to bed late, lack of exercise, smoking, etc. Just like 30 days is enough time to adopt a new habit, make it your goal to rid of a bad habit in the same timeframe. In most cases, you can.
7. Become a super connector
Ever notice how the most successful people are connected to every other successful person? This isn't a coincidence.
People often mistake that your network comes from the success you have. But it's the other way around. Success comes from the quality of the network you grow.
Make it a habit to introduce people that could benefit from each other, and don't expect anything in return. As your connection's network increases, so does yours.
Make 2015 the year to become a superconnector.
8. Learn how to meditate
Clarity of mind is one of the most important factors to increasing productivity, creativity, and effectiveness in any work you take on. Meditating for even ten minutes will help you revitalize your busy mind and will prepare you for the long day ahead.
You can check out Headspace, a great app for effective meditating.
9. Get a Virtual Assistant
There's only 24 hours in the day for you to work, eat, sleep, and spend time with your loved ones. Time is your most important asset, and you can't grow your business by yourself.
Having an assistant  --  virtual or in-person  --  will allow you focus on the important tasks that matter, not uploading photos on Facebook.
If you've never hired virtually before, check out Chris Ducker's Virtual Freedom.
10. 10x your Goal
Raise your standards. Increase your expectations. Have bigger dreams.
This goes for every aspect of your life: health, wealth, love. Expect more from yourself and raise the standards of what you're willing to accept in life. The reward will be worth the wait.
If you shoot for the moon and miss your target, at least you'll land in the stars.

Financial Collapse: The Sequelreddit
Wall Street lobbyists have snuck into the budget package an amendment that would repeal the part of Dodd-Frank that reins in the financial weapon of mass destruction called Credit Default Swaps. Per usual, it is Elizabeth Warren that explains this best.
You will hear a lot of folks say that the rule that will be repealed in the Omnibus is technical and complicated, and that you shouldn't worry about it because smart people who know more than you about financial issues say that it's no big deal. Don't believe them. Actually, the rule is pretty simple. Here's what it's called -- the rule that the House is about to repeal -- and I'm quoting from the text of Dodd-Frank: "PROHIBITION AGAINST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BAILOUTS OF SWAPS ENTITIES." What does it do?  The provision that's about to be repealed requires banks to keep separate a key part of their risky Wall Street speculation so that there's no government insurance for that part of their business. As the New York Times has explained, "the goal was to isolate risky trading and to prevent government bailouts" -- because these sorts of risky trades -- called 'derivatives' trades - were "a main culprit in the 2008 financial crisis."
It was Mitch McConnell that demanded this repeal, and House Republicans who are leading the charge on it, but Democrats have the power to stop this terrible idea that would practically guarantee an explosion of new high-risk Wall Street speculation, and make another financial panic likely within the next few years. In the House, Boehner will need some Democratic votes for the omnibus budget package because his tea party caucus doesn't like this bill. In the Senate, Democrats -- who are still in the majority -- could walk away from this terrible idea and force a new package to be crafted. And the president does still have the veto pen, and he could say no to this craziness.
Now there are some heavily pro-Wall Street Democrats like Chuck Schumer who are actually for this idea, but a lot of them are saying that this is a big, complicated package with lots of good and bad in it, and it is too hard to renegotiate this provision and walk away from the deal. But Credit Default Swaps will, sooner or later and probably sooner, destroy our economy, and this is a battle that has to be fought.
Call your House and Senate members right now, because the House vote will probably be tomorrow, and the Senate will come shortly thereafter: the Capitol switchboard is 202-224-3121. And call the White House as well, they can stop this: 202-456-1414. And listen to Warren explain this beast of an amendment:

SEC Holding Crowdfunding Hostagereddit
The SEC is blocking small business' access to funding and delaying job creation. Congress passed Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, commonly known as the JOBS Act, in 2012 and ordered the SEC to write rules for its implementation by January 2013.  The SEC is more than two years late and businesses are suffering as a result.
With $18 trillion dollars in IRAs that could be invested in job-creating small businesses, the SEC's foot-dragging delay is weakening the ability of small businesses to raise capital. Its attempt to protect unaccredited investors from access to IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) of small and medium size businesses is misguided in the Internet age.
Crowdfunding is what the JOBS Act Title III is all about.  It allows individuals to buy into IPOs of small-cap companies directly, far earlier and likely at a lower price than if you waited for a broker-dealer to underwrite an offering.  If you have a company, even a start-up, it provides an avenue to attract investors, even for seemingly high-risk deals.
If you are a bank, you may soon find innovative ways to combine government guarantees with crowdfunding to reduce risk in making loans to companies you historically wouldn't approve.
Obtaining start-up financing for a new venture has long been monopolized by the financial industry. While small businesses have always been the major job creators in the economy, they have been blocked from more easily raising funds by an archaic pre-Internet system of 1930's securities laws fiercely maintained by existing powers in the finance industry.  Crowdfunding will disintermediate some players and they are scared.  The SEC seems to be listening them, rather than Congress and the public.
Do the wealthy really have better judgment than those closest to where the rubber meets the road in business? Not so much.  Widespread crowdfunding that allows raising money across state lines may be a ways off, but it will allow people familiar with risks of particular businesses to buy into IPOs.
Broker-dealers often hold deals close and reward their friends at the expense of businesses raising capital.  While this is great if you are in the inner circle, it prohibits outsiders from getting in on the ground floor.
Little by little, state-by-state, new legislation such as Title III under the JOBS Act (at the federal level) is changing the way businesses are capitalized. Slowly, legislators are seeing the light, pressured by business owners starved for capital and investors who are tired of being played by broker-dealers.  We can't do crowdfunding easily at the federal level yet, but we are getting closer.  Some states are dragging their feet, and the SEC is watering down the intent of the law by limiting offerings to accredited investors where the legislation intended a more open opportunity for smaller, non accredited investors to participate, investors that may actually have first hand experience with a business.
The root of the problem lies in archaic classifications of investors derived from the early 1930's securities laws.  They make an assumption that accredited investors are more informed than the non-accredited.  Before the Internet, this may have made some sense, but no longer.  The SEC, a bit of an old-school relic, appears to be attempting to water down the JOBS Act's potential for job creation by monkeying with the definitions of accredited investors. They appear to want to impose their own out-of-date belief structure on a modern marketplace that they may not appreciate has the ability to ferret out information instantly, information well beyond what even accredited investors might find.
That leaves us with the SEC trying to use its rulemaking authority in opposition to the legislative intentions of the JOBS Act, which is to bring more capital into the economy and grow small businesses that create jobs.  Is this a poorly masked attempt to preserve the monopoly the securities industry, which is comprised of only accredited investors, maintains under the guise of protecting the poor, uninformed widow who was a victim of the bucket shops of the 1920's?  We don't protect gamblers from choosing how to spend their money, so why have we been prohibiting people from investing as they see fit, preventing them from reaping the rewards of investing their resources to strengthen the American economy?  Is this another systemic consequence that preserves the separation between the haves and have nots?
Hundreds of thousands of businesses are willing to share their profits with investors, but could never afford the costs of the traditional public offering. These businesses urgently need capital to hire people to expand their businesses.
The existing regulations cut off investing opportunities for the very people who might contribute the most valuable experience solely because they don't have enough assets to be considered accredited investors.  This can limit the pool of potential funding sources to a small number of investors who might participate as a group, gaining unreasonable control which may make self-serving decisions that are in direct conflict with the company's (and other owners') best interests.
Those with 401K plans, money under their mattresses, and savings accounts earning next-to-nothing, will be permitted to invest relatively small amounts in stock offered to the general public by public solicitation.  While currently only accredited investors can participate fully, we need the flexibility the JOBS Act was created to provide.  We need to permit non accredited investors to participate in these IPOs, albeit to a limited degree.
Thankfully, the old-school protectionism for the "incompetent investor" is slowly ending. And so it should. Change is working its way up from the state level to the federal level.
We don't protect gamblers from choosing how to spend their money, so why have we been prohibiting people from investing as they see fit?  Shouldn't they be able to reap the rewards of using their resources to strengthen the American economy?

You can take down Pirate Bay  but you cant kill the Internet it createdBy Caitlin Dewey December 10, 2014 Follow @caitlindewey
In the late hours of Tuesday night, the Pirate Bay abruptly disappeared from the Internet, the result of a surprise raid on the site’s servers by Swedish police in Stockholm.
But forget the big-picture questions of Internet freedom or intellectual property. The real problem, for millions of Internet-users, is how am I going to watch TV?
See, the Pirate Bay is as much an idea and an orientation to entertainment media as it is/was a torrent-tracking site. Sure, the Pirate Bay technically indexed torrents, a peer-to-peer file format popular for sharing movies, music and other oversized files. But since its launch in 2003, the world’s “most notorious file-sharing site” has done something a bit more significant, and a bit more permanent, too: It’s made digital piracy a casual, inarguable part of the mainstream.
During just one month in 2013, more than 340 million people tried to download illegal content, an industry report claimed. In North America, Europe and Asia — the regions where most infringement comes from — that averages out to one in four Internet users.
“The free and simple availability of copyrighted content through piracy ecosystems continues to drive the popularity of hundreds of websites,” the report goes on to say. “Users of piracy ecosystems, the number of Internet users who regularly obtain infringing content, and the amount of bandwidth consumed by infringing uses of content all increased significantly between 2010 and 2013.”
(NetNames Piracy Analysis v2)
It wasn’t always this way, of course. Before the birth of the torrent protocol in the early aughts, sharing big files, like TV shows or movies was virtually impossible. But in the early aughts, an American guy named Bram Cohen invented, essentially, a new way for computers to communicate data and named it BitTorrent. Less than two years later, in November 2003, just as BitTorrent was starting to gain steam , a little-known group of Swedish activists launched a site to help people find and access these shared BitTorrent files.
Pirate Bay wasn’t the first torrenting site, by any means — but it quickly became the largest, and the one that stuck around. (It’s no coincidence that the popularity of the phrase “torrent download” grew, in lockstep, with the profile of Pirate Bay.) It helped, probably, that Pirate Bay was initially operated by Piratbyran, a sort of pro-piracy think tank, which lobbied extensively against intellectual property law and wanted to popularize torrenting for “moral and political” reasons. In other words, they had the courage of conviction on their side.
Even when TPB split off from Pitatbyran shortly after its founding, administrators for the site remained involved with the group, circulating petitions, hosting rallies and publishing on “the practical, moral and philosophical issues of file sharing.” And even when law enforcement and industry groups began going after the Pirate Bay — the site was first raided in 2006, and its founders arrested and charged with aiding copyright infringement three years later — the site stayed online, moving frequently to new domains and changing to a more secure, cloud-based infrastructure in 2012.
And yet, despite all these (substantial!) threats, torrenting — on Pirate Bay, the largest torrenting portal, and off it — has only become more popular and more entrenched. Between 2011 and 2013, for instance, unique users on torrenting sites jumped 23.6 percent. There are now tens of millions of people accustomed to getting their “Game of Thrones” and “Breaking Bad” and “Walking Dead” illegally, online. In fact, more people watch “Game of Thrones” by torrent than watch it on HBO — a figure that, more than any other, should hammer in how well-entrenched this whole digital-piracy thing is.
Pirate Bay could very well come back online soon; there’s certainly no evidence, at this juncture, to suggest that it won’t, and the site has bounced back from several such hurdles before. But even if TPB doesn’t return, the politics and the conventions it advanced — that content should be free, and if you torrent, they can be! — will be very difficult to eradicate.
You may be able to shut down Pirate Bay, but good luck raiding the Internet that Pirate Bay created.

When Gary Tackett and his wife saw the dented old wreck that their waitress was driving to work  they decided she needed some new wheels.Email
Cindi Grady had just finished serving a large group of diners at Cracker Barrel in Branson, Missouri, when her manager asked her to step outside the restaurant for a moment.
That’s when she spied a silver 2008 Ford Fusion with a shiny red bow on the roof.
“It’s not new,” Gary Tackett tells Grady in a YouTube video shot by his daughter. “But it’s new to you.”
Video: Two Cracker Barrel customers in Missouri give waitress Cindi Grady a new car to replace the duct-taped jalopy she was driving to work.
Tackett and his wife, Roxann, regulars at the diner, had noticed Grady’s blue dented jalopy in the lot — courtesy of one too many run-ins with deer, one window was covered in plastic and the hood was strapped down. The Quitman, Arkansas, couple decided their favorite waitress, who has worked at the restaurant a little over two years, needed some new wheels.
On Nov. 29, the Tacketts presented Grady with keys to the vehicle.  
“I cannot believe that someone would be that generous to me,” a smiling Grady told NBC affiliate KARK of Little Rock, Ark.  Tackett’s daughter shared the video of the four-door tip on social media. Since then, the story has been shared thousands of times.
Grady isn’t the first Cracker Barrel waitress who has risen to Internet fame, however. In January 2014, Abigail Sailors had a lengthy conversation with two customers and wound up telling them her whole life story. When the 18-year old college student collected their bill, she found more than $6,000 in tips.
“It’s wonderful that there are people out there who do things like this,” said tipping expert Mike Lynn, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. “It’s human nature to identify and try to help real people.”
Janella Escobar, the director of corporate communications for Cracker Barrel, agrees. Escobar said the guests who patronize the restaurant chain, famous for its old-timey rocking chairs, help nurture a family atmosphere with staff.
“Cracker Barrel’s mission is to please people,” said Escobar. “It’s wonderful when we see our guests turn around and live out that mission.”
In February, Myles Eckart, 8,  stumbled upon a $20 bill in an Ohio Cracker Barrel parking lot. Rather than pocket the dough, the boy penned a heartfelt note and presented it to Lt. Col. Frank Dailey, who was eating at the restaurant. Myles’ father was killed in Iraq, and in the note the boy thanks “Soldier” for his service and says that in his family, “We like to pay it forward.”
Reports of headline-grabbing tips have surfaced elsewhere. North Carolina bartender Chrisi Kemp scored a $1,000 gratuity on a $14.01 bar tab. Despite terrible service at an Iowa restaurant, a couple left a hefty $100 tip for their waiter and a note that read, “We’ve both been in your shoes. Paying it forward.”
In Branson, Grady is back at work slinging pancakes and chicken pot pie but now after a shift she can head home in style.
“I’m still shell-shocked,” Grady said in a social media post.

Google GOSF objective is not discounts: 5 power pointsGoogle India’s director for e-commerce and online classifieds Nitin Bawankule talks to FE’s Anand J ahead of this year’s Great Online Shopping Festival (GOSF), which started Tuesday midnight.
How different is this year’s GOSF from the previous editions?
We started off with 90 merchants in 2012, last year we had 250 merchants and this year it is 450 sellers. It was a one day affair in 2012, while this year the website has gone online 14 days prior to GOSF and we are running a competition for shoppers and there will be one winner everyday. This is because of the heightened interest and activity and the idea is to spread the message of online shopping across the country. With this, we want to bring many first time online shoppers to the industry.
The e-commerce industry has evolved a lot over the past year or so. How has that affected GOSF?
The big difference is a single e-commerce player running a campaign to direct traffic on its website and the whole ecosystem of merchants trying to create awareness about online commerce and this will drive more shoppers online. If you see the list of merchants, there are lot of offline players who are not generally associated with online commerce like Asian Paints, real estate players or Lakme are participating in GOSF. Consumers come to know that he can buy these products online.
Discounts are the order of the day. How do you stay relevant?
Objective of GOSF is not discounts. It is not the primary reason why shoppers buy online. Most surveys show that people prefer e-commerce because of convenience and catalogue the platform offers. From one player driven discount and sale, GOSF is a platform where 450 merchants are participating and the consumers are spoilt for choice. No single player is present across all the categories in an exhaustive way that you might not have even heard of. For instance, Flipkart does not sell FMCG or Amazon is not big on apparel yet. You wont see Asian Paints on online platforms usually.
Do you see the e-commerce players getting indifferent towards GOSF?
There are only 3.5 crore people buying online whereas the internet population is approaching 30 crore users. That is almost 90% of our internet users still have not done a single transaction online. The bigger players have not managed to bring this population online yet. Most of the e-commerce players are excited about this and you can see it from their participation in GOSF. There are lot of smaller and offline players participating in the event. Why should we restrict to the top players or even the 450 merchants. We have millions of small shops. We had to drop many because their websites were not up to the mark or they have not figured out the logistics. Over the past year the logistics have improved helping us to have even 450 merchants and we told the merchants well in advance for them to prepare for GOSF. Many have invested in front end and back end capabilities.
How is Google going to benefit from GOSF?
As a key player in the internet ecosystem, we expect that consumers search for product information on Google. Our endeavour is to expand the overall internet ecosystem and that is true of any of the initiatives that we run that will in turn empower the consumer. There is a huge mass of population in smaller cities of the country wanting to buy products online as the specific products are not available offline. Everyone will have the same information and nobody is under-privileged on internet. The growth of Android has also helped the e-commerce industry grow as we helped the smartphone and the internet population to explode.

Nathuram Godse a patriot just like Mahatma Gandhi: BJP MP Sakshi MaharajIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
Rajya Sabha today witnessed uproarious scenes with members from Congress lodging strong protest against eulogising of Nathuram Godse by Bharatiya Janata Party MP at a function held in Maharashtra earlier this month.
‘Nathuram Godse a patriot just like Mahatma Gandhi,’ says BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj during a programme in Maharashtra according to NDTV report.
Under attack from the opposition members, Government disapproved of any such event hailing Mahatma Gandhi’s killer but said no organisation should be defamed.
The Upper House saw two brief adjournments over the issue as Congress members protested holding placards in the aisles and raising slogans, while charging right-wing organisations with lending their support to it.
Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Husain Dalwai (Cong) said he has written to Maharashtra Chief Minister over hosting the event attended by some religious leaders and former MLAs.
“Mahatma Gandhi’s killer is being eulogised by hosting his ‘Shaurya Diwas’ in Maharashtra…These people talk of development, but are trying to create a rift in society,” he said, accusing the right-wing organisations of indulging in such things, including religious conversions that created tension in society.
Congress members created uproar over the issue and raised slogans while displaying placards of the event, even as Deputy Chairman P J Kurien tried to pacify the agitating members, asking them to take their seats and maintain peace.
“Don’t make use of Zero Hour for this kind of display. This is gross indiscipline…To decide the culpability or otherwise, the courts are there, not me or you,” Kurien said.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, “This is not acceptable. Mahatma Gandhi’s killer, whosoever it may be, we are against it…We do not accept any honour of Mahatma Gandhi’s killers.”
As members continued their protest and the House witnessed acrimonious exchanges between both sides, Kurien adjourned the proceedings for 10 minutes just before noon.
But, similar scenes were witnessed when the House met at noon, forcing the Chair to adjourn it again for 15 minutes.
When the House reassembled, Anand Sharma (Cong) said, “It is not acceptable that some one eulogises him. I hope neither the House nor the Parliamentary Affairs Minister will approve of such an action. Let the House speak in one voice and condemn it.”
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said, “There is no question of eulogising such a person. We should leave the matter there, but defaming an organisation is not acceptable.”
It was after this that normal proceedings resumed.

Top 4 reasons why Dalal Street is edgy | Sensex loses 229 pointsTop four factors why Sensex is under pressure
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Dec 11, 2014, 04.50PM IST

Bank of China
(Sensex seems to have run…)
MUMBAI: After hitting an all-time high late last month, the S&P BSE Sensex now seems to have run out of steam. The index has seen a massive correction of over 1280 points or 4.45 per cent in just nine trading sessions. The weakness is expected to continue for some more time in the market and the benchmarks may slip further in the coming sessions.
Following are the factors that are impacting the Indian markets:
Crude oil: Global equity markets came under selling pressure as crude oil price fell to near $60 per barrel after OPEC lowered its projection for 2015 by about 300,000 barrels a day to 28.9 million a day.
The OPEC report has cut its forecast for growth in global demand in 2015 due to a weaker outlook for Europe and Asia, and predicted higher supply growth from shale and other non-OPEC sources.
This led to a sharp correction in the US and the Asian markets. Fall in crude oil prices is a positive for India. However, if it is on account recession in global markets, it can have a negative impact on the Indian exports.
Global factors: Even as market experts remain optimistic on Indian growth story, negative news flow from around the world is making FIIs jittery.
Despite efforts by central banks, economic activity refuses to pick up in Europe, Japan and China. The slowdown in China is evident even as the People's Bank of China unexpectedly lowered interest rates. There are concerns that recovery in Europe will be fragile.
"The eurozone recovery remains fragile, with weakness widespread across member countries in both the periphery and the core. The last two quarters witnessed a marked slowdown in Germany, where yoy growth sagged to 1.2 per cent in 3Q14 from 2.3 per cent in 1Q14," said a Fitch Ratings report.
Rupee depreciation: The Indian rupee has fallen 0.42 per cent against the US dollar to 62.28 in trade today, its lowest level since February.
The rupee has been on a steady decline against the US dollar. Over the last couple of months, the US dollar has strengthened against global currencies. Somehow, the Indian rupee had been steady and didn't depreciate to the extent most other global currencies have.
Analysts are expecting the rupee to slip to 63 per dollar mark by the end of March 2015.
"While India's macro strength would prevent a sharp INR depreciation, we still expect USD/INR to push to 63 by the end of March 2015," said a Kotak Securities report.
Technical levels: The market has corrected from its higher end of trading range and is close to support levels. It breached intermediate support of 8,300 intraday making traders nervous.
"I will look at that 8,250-8,300 mark. As long as it does not break that, it is a buy on dips market, but once it cracks that 8250 level decisively, then we could see a much deeper cut and possibly then, I would wait for those lower levels for investment opportunities," said market expert Ambareesh Baliga to ET Now.

Germany confident India will find  practical solution  to the language issueBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 4:59 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 5:09 pm
Germany on Thursday voiced confidence that the Modi government will find a “practical solution” to the issue of dropping German language as an alternative to Sanskrit in central schools.
“I can only tell you that I am and continue to be very confident that India will find a practical solution on this issue,” German ambassador Michael Steiner said.
Government’s move to drop German as an alternative to Sanskrit as a third language in Kendriya Vidyalayas prompted German chancellor Angela Merkel to raise the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G 20 Summit in Australia last month. Modi assured Merkel of looking at it within the confines of the Indian system.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court also asked the Human Resource Development Ministry to consider continuing German for the present academic session .
Centre had stuck to its decision on replacing German as the third language with Sanskrit in Kendriya Vidyalayas but conceded that no exam would be conducted for the subject in the current session.
The HRD ministry decided to bring in Sanskrit in place of German as third language. Over 70,000 students across 500 Kendriya Vidyalayas from classes VI to VIII were asked to switch from German to Sanskrit.
The 2011 memorandum of understanding that made German a third language was signed between the Kendriya Vidyalayas and Goethe Institute-Max Mueller Bhawan.
Sanskrit teachers had moved to the Delhi High Court alleging that the central schools had introduced German as a third language in place of Sanskrit against the education policy.

MUMBAI: Continuing its falling streak for the fourth straight day, the rupee weakened against the US currency due to sustained demand for the greenback from importers.
The Indian currency made day's low of 62.36 versus the US dollar to finally end the day at 62.33.
The dollar's gains against other currencies overseas and a lower opening in the domestic equity market also put pressure on the local unit, forex dealers said.
The rupee had lost 14 paise to end at over one-week low of 62.02 against the greenback yesterday on sustained dollar demand from importers and fresh capital outflows.

BJP MLA s  indecent  Priyanka Gandhi act pannedIf Mamata Banerjee arrested, Bengal will be on fire: Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali
Karnataka Assembly was today adjourned briefly amid chaos over a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA watching a zoomed in picture of Priyanka Gandhi on his mobile phone during House proceedings.
As the House assembled, slogan shouting Congress members rushed to the front row of seats, demanding strict action against Prabhu Chavan for the “indecent act” yesterday.
The members said Chavan’s “unacceptable” conduct had hurt the dignity of their leader and demanded action against him.
Chavan was caught on TV camera watching a zoomed in photo of Priyanka Gandhi on his mobile phone and another BJP MLA U B Banakar was found playing video games, oblivious of the discussion about the plight of sugarcane growers to whom sugar mill owners owe huge arrears.
In the video footage, Chavan was also seen watching images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi along with Sonia Gandhi.
As the incident left the BJP red-faced, he had later said he zoomed in the picture of Priyanka Gandhi only to read a slogan below but admitted that it was a “mistake” to have taken the mobile phone inside the House.
Raising the issue, Law and Parliamentary Minister T B Jayachandra demanded action against Chavan and sought a permanent solution to prevent recurrence of such incidents.
The Minister said the incident has not only tarnished the image of the two legislators, but also that of the legislature.
Referring to the earlier incident during BJP’s rule when Laxman Savadi and C C Patil, then ministers, were caught on TV camera watching pornography on their mobiles, he said a report has been submitted but no action had been taken.
The matter has gained serious proportions as it has reached the portals of the Parliament where the issue might come up for discussion and such an incident has hurt the sentiments of the legislators, Jayachandra said.
Opposition BJP Leader Jagadish Shettar demanded that the Chair put an end to such incidents and curb the use of mobile phones in the House.
Admitting the folly made by his party legislator, Shettar requested Speaker Kagodu Thimappa to allow the member to issue a statement in the House. He said the act has maligned the image of public representatives.
Chavan’s conduct was unbecoming of a public representative, especially when the people had “unpleasant” views on legislators, Shettar, a former Chief Minister, said.
Before adjourning the House for ten minutes, Thimappa requested Congress members to take their seats and resume proceedings as Chavan had apologised “with tears in his eyes” in his chamber.
“The legislator visited me and apologised for the incident and shed tears. I think it will be appropriate that the members resume their seats and allow the House to function,” he said.

(Shares of oil majors in business…)
MUMBAI: Shares of oil majors in business of exploration and production (E&P) came under pressure as Brent crude oil prices fell below $65 per barrel on oversupply concerns.
Shares of upstream companies are negatively hit by a drop in oil prices because it affects oil production and gross refining margins of these firms.
"A sharp oil price decline would lead to weakness in upstream oil producers like Cairn India, ONGC and Oil India . As RIL also has domestic and US shale production, it will be also affected negatively," said Nomura report.
Macquarie has downgraded ONGC and Cairn India after the sharp fall in oil prices.
According to the brokerage, OVL (ONGC's subsidiary) is unaffected by subsidy & contributes around 17 per cent to ONGC's earnings.
"We lower target price for ONGC to Rs 470 (from Rs 500), largely to factor-in the impact of lower crude price on OVL," the report said.
Macquarie is of the view that Cairn India is the most exposed to crude prices. The company's profitability is directly related to crude oil prices.
Shares of Cairn India have been hitting 52-week lows for quite some time now.
"Among upstream companies, Cairn is likely to see the worst impact as it is a pure play," says a Nomura report.
ONGC ended 3.21 per cent lower, RIL closed 2.76 per cent down and Cairn India 2.30 per cent lower.
Earlier, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) lowered its projection for 2015 by about 300,000 barrels a day to 28.9 million a day.
OPEC report has cut its forecast for growth in global demand in 2015 due to a weaker outlook for Europe and Asia, and predicted higher supply growth from shale and other non-OPEC sources.

Rouble hits new low as Western sanctions rack RussiaUkraine Crisis (2013-2014)
Rouble hits new low as Western sanctions rack Russia
Russia's central bank raised its main lending rate to 10.5 percent on Thursday to prop up the rouble but failed to stop the currency sinking to a new low.
The inability to halt the rouble's decline after a fall in oil prices and Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis pose a growing challenge for President Vladimir Putin as his popularity is partly based on providing stability and prosperity.

"This was the very minimum the central bank could deliver given the slide in the rouble. We think further hikes are more likely than not in 2015," said Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London.
The bank's rate decision did little to buttress the rouble, which fell below 55 to the dollar for the first time on the Moscow Exchange shortly before the announcement and continued falling afterwards, hitting 55.45 roubles per dollar.
The central bank has been under intense pressure to tighten policy but has also had to weigh the additional burden that higher lending rates put on Russia's sanctions-hit economy.
Many economists now predict Russia's economy will slide into recession next year, as the Western sanctions show no sign of being withdrawn soon and plummeting oil prices are threatening the country's main source of export revenue. 
Vladimir Kolychev, an economist at VTB Capital in Moscow, said he expected further measures from the central bank, for instance moves to increase foreign-currency liquidity.
A few months ago there were hundreds (thousands?) of comments about how sanctions wouldn't work and we needed to send troops, or at least a few billion in weapons, to show Putin how tough we are. So far, so good.

States oppose GST Bill; compensation, petroleum remain vexed issues

(At a meeting of the Empowered…)
NEW DELHI: In a setback to the Centre, states today rejected the draft Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill saying it does not address their concerns, particularly on entry tax and taxation of petroleum products.
At a meeting of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, the Centre's plan to bring petroleum goods under GST regime was opposed.
They also objected to the the Constitutional Amendment Bill as it does not contain provisions for giving states compensation against any possible loss of revenue after GST roll-out for five years.
"There is no consensus between the Centre and states on these three things (compensation issue, petrol tax and entry tax). The Empowered Committee is not supporting the Bill without these three things," Empowered Committee Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather said after a meeting of the state Finance Ministers.
The central government, he stressed, "will have to respect views of the states."
The states want that the Centre to compensate them for any loss of revenue on implementation of the GST for five years and a clause regarding the compensation be included in the Constitution Amendment Bill, Rather said.
The state governments are also keen on keeping the entry tax and petro tax out of the ambit of the GST.
In a bid to roll out the GST, which would subsume excise and service taxes, the Centre has come out with a new Constitutional Amendment Bill.
"Government hasn't agreed to our recommendations made last time, except one recommendation. We had said that the share of Union government in GST should go to the divisible pool and should be devolved among states , that has been agreed by Centre," Rather said.
Rather said that the draft of the new Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was received by the Committee earlier in the month, did not take on board the suggestions of the state Finance Ministers.
"But we were surprised to know that government hasn't agreed to our recommendations made last time, except one recommendation with regard to putting GST in divisible pool," he added.
However, with regard to petroleum products, entry tax and compensation, he said, "the Government of India has not agreed to our recommendation."
Rather welcomed the decision of the Centre to release Rs 11,000 crore to states as compensation towards the central sales tax (CST) this financial year.
"So far as CST compensation is concerned, we are happy to know that the Centre has agreed to keep a provision of Rs 11,000 crore in the current year's budget...that will settle the claim of CST compensation up to the year 2010-11," he said, adding that the compensation for latter years would be discussed with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
Jaitley announced release of additional funds to the states while replying to a discussion on supplementary demands for grants in the Lok Sabha yesterday.
Clearance of CST compensation arrears has been a bone of contention between Centre and states.
  CST, a tax imposed on the inter-state movement of goods, was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in 2007-08 and further to 2 per cent in 2008-09 after the introduction of Value-Added Tax (VAT). The Centre had then promised the states that it would bear losses due to reduction of CST.
As part of the roll-out of GST, the CST is being phased out and has been reduced to two per cent from the earlier four per cent. The Centre collects CST and distributes it among states.
The GST roll-out has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the proposed new tax regime.

ICC Prosecutor poised to take on Russia as well as U.S.By Eugene Kontorovich December 11, 2014
Yesterday I discussed how the Senate’s “Torture Report” may add impetus to a preliminary investigation of the United States by the International Criminal Court. Yet U.S. is not the only major power with an emerging ICC problem. The ICC prosecutor recently announced that she may “soon” open a full investigation into Russian crimes in occupied Georgia (Remember Georgia? Russia grabbed it before it took Crimea before it took eastern Ukraine.)
A showdown between The Hague and Moscow would be no small thing. The latter is almost certain to not cooperate, and without that, the ICC is ineffectual . In a new contribution to the European Journal of International Law’s blog , I analyze the parameters of the possible inquiry, which oddly omits several categories of possible crimes, from disproportionate force by both sides, to settlement activity by Russia.

Developer: Capitol Crossing is very tough to getBy Jonathan O'Connell December 11, 2014 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
Jeffrey I. Sussman was facing stiff head winds with his ambitious 2.2 million-square-foot development project, Capitol Crossing .
And that was before the kerfuffle over his proposed closing of Interstate 395.
Sussman and the New York-based company he founded 43 years ago — Property Group Partners — have forged an expertise in developing buildings that quickly attract the prestigious law firms and professional services companies that typically pay some of the highest rents in Washington.
In 2006, the company completed 1101 New York Ave. NW and landed a slew of tenants led by Ernst & Young. Three years later, it completed a glass-skinned building a few blocks from the White House that attracted the law firm Fried Frank and sold earlier this year for a record price of $948 per square foot.
Capitol Crossing is Sussman’s boldest Washington effort to date, one that requires years of engineering and political maneuvering and which is moving headlong into a leasing market that some commercial real estate analysts are calling the worst in decades.

In a deal with the District that Sussman inked in 2010, his company — then named Louis Dreyfus Property Group –  acquired the “air rights” to 6.8 acres above the sunken I-395 entrance. The project offers the District an opportunity to grow its tax base by an estimated $30 million and recover the street grid in the area by connecting F and G streets between Second and Third streets.
Sussman lined up a Fortune 500 insurance company with whom he previously partnered, W.R. Berkley Corp. of Greenwich, Conn., to put up the lion’s share of the development costs, which could be near $1.5 billion. It is the chance to build four new office properties, the likes of which Sussman has been so successful at leasing, at a time when companies — led by tech firms — and their employees are quickly moving into downtown areas.
“That’s where their employees are going to want to be,” Sussman said. “You read about it in San Francisco because those employees don’t want to be in Palo Alto, despite the incentives of buses and shuttles and bikes. They’re going to want to be in the heart of the city.”
The agreement, however, carries tremendous upfront costs before Sussman can collect a dime of rent from the project.
To begin with, a 138-year-old brick building that housed District’s first synagogue was on the development site and could not be torn down. PGP negotiated a deal with the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington to move the 273-ton structure, twice. Once to get it off the development site, which was done by flatbed truck before construction began, and a second time to what will be its permanent home as a museum at Third and F streets.
Then there is the matter of the deck on which the buildings will sit, estimated to cost $200 million. Sussman has been pushing to get the Federal Highway Administration to close more than half a mile of I-395 in order to save as much as 18 months of construction time. To improve its chances, Property Group Partners has spent $330,000 with the public affairs firm Mercury/Clark & Weinstock since 2012, according to Opensecrets.org.
But the suggestion was met with disdain by drivers last week. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D)  indicated he would not request the closure, effectively killing the idea.

Looking at the leasing market downtown, a delayed construction schedule might not be such a bad thing. The white collar firms Sussman is used to courting have been downsizing, pushing the vacancy rate downtown to 11.3 percent. About 823,000 more square feet was vacated than occupied over the past 12 months. Also, one of the few big tenants in the market, Fannie Mae, recently took a pass on Capitol Crossing.
“If you look at the office market, it has been virtually void of net demand the last four years,” said Randolph C. Harrell, an executive vice president at the services firm CBRE. “Just kind of bumping along the bottom, which is not usual. I’ve been in the business 29 years, and this is the longest down market I’ve seen.”
Harrell and Sussman both said buildings with efficient floor layouts are still leasing well. Construction of the deck, Harrell said, would give companies looking to move far more assurance.
“Once they make the investment of $200 million, they’ve played the card at that point and they’ve got to go,” he said.
Sussman said it’s been difficult to lease the project because people have a hard time envisioning three new city blocks where there is currently empty space. “It’s very tough to get it. To see that. And I think once this infrastructure is complete, in seven or eight years people will say, ‘How come we didn’t do that before?’ ”
PGP has been marketing the project for more than a two years from its office on New York Avenue, but recently began pulling out all the stops in search of tenants. Scrapping an old three-dimensional model of the site, PGP purchased a new one that shows the neighborhood around it in intricate detail — down to the tulips along the sidewalk — and a second that interacts with an iPad program to highlight amenities.

Visitors are shown a flashy video that’s nearly three minutes long on a wall of nine flat-screen televisions. Sussman said the idea is to give people a better idea of the location, which he said some have called “funny” or “questionable.”
“I love how people are saying it’s a questionable location. Questionable to what?” he said. “It’s the western end of the downtown area. It’s Capitol Hill. It’s a new area.”
He said he pictured Capitol Crossing as a legacy project for his company, one on par with some of the most ambitious work of his competitors.
“There are a bunch of developers who step out. Boston Properties, Vornado, JBG certainly, Carr, Akridge — they really step out and do big stuff. And I think the tenant community and the broker community tend to lag in interest because they don’t see it. They want to see it before they believe it,” he said.

Great Online Shopping Festival a huge succes...Amazon
(Internet giant Google today…)
MUMBAI: Internet giant Google today said that response to the ongoing Great Online Shopping Festival has "exceeded wildest expectations", with Tata Group's realty arm having bagged 10,000 bookings in a single day.
"The GOSF has exceeded the wildest of our expectations with the response that we have had to GOSF," Google India Managing Director Rajan Anandan said.

"This is unlike the experience last year, when there were issues with connectivity," he said.
He said realty firm Tata Housing alone has witnessed 10,000 bookings of flats within the first day of the GOSF, for which Google has tied-up with 450 merchants who are offering special discounts on merchandise.
The Google India head said this is very important as users have to pay Rs 25,000 for the booking.
Meanwhile, Bangalore-based Puravankara booked 125 homes online in less than 12 hours of the offer going live in both the Puravankara and Provident brands.
The sale, which is on till December 12, has seen sales of small and medium online retailers surge by up to ten times, while the same for established retailers like Flipkart and Amazon are up by up to 100 per cent, Anandan said.
The busiest section is a special deal corner offering items at Rs 299, while the busiest time for the shopping is between 1800-0000 hours and during lunch breaks between 1200-1400 hours, he said.

(The two investors will each…)
NEW DELHI: The Russian Direct Investment Fund will team up with an Indian partner to invest $1 billion in infrastructure and hydroelectric projects in Asia's third-largest economy, the head of the Russian state fund told Reuters on Wednesday.
The RDIF and India's IDFC , a leading infrastructure investor, will each commit $500 million to projects under a deal to be signed on Thursday during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to overcome India's chronic power shortages, and the country has vast untapped hydroelectric potential in its northern Himalayan belt.
RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev told Reuters the investments would back projects involving a large Russian hydro-power company but he declined to name the company.
The only large Russian player in this area is state-controlled Rushydro. Rushydro's spokeswoman Yelena Vishnyakova could not immediately be reached by for comment.
IDFC, which is 16 percent state owned, confirmed it would sign a partnership with RDIF but declined to comment on the details.
The Russian fund was set up in 2011 with $10 billion in state funds. It can back investments as long as its partners match it at least dollar for dollar. Dmitriev said he expected to commit funds to the Indian projects next year.
The RDIF has so far invested $1.3 billion of its own money along with $6 billion by outside investors, mainly sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Asia.
Dmitriev said the RDIF had managed to turn profits on investments in a Russian telecoms company and the Moscow stock exchange despite Western sanctions, a slowing economy and sliding oil prices.

Gift Guide: Small  Smart Stocking Techie StuffersAging Schwarzenegger Should Enjoy Full Recovery
Dec. 26, 2006
Follow @DanChildsABC
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former action movie star and current California governor, will likely recover fully from the broken leg he suffered in a skiing accident on Dec. 23.
This, coupled with the fact that the 59-year-old Schwarzenegger's broken femur was likely a result of high speeds rather than weak bones, should be encouraging news for aging baby boomers who engage in exhilarating sports.
"The message that is really out there now is that, as a society, I think we are coming to view the aging years very differently than we did before," says Dr. Regis O'Keefe, director of the musculoskeletal research center at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. "We have a desire in the population to maintain high levels of function."
And continuing medical advances should help support this desire, he says.
"I think that Gov. Schwarzenegger, in maintaining his activity, is a model of what people today can expect as they get older, and I think that the medical and scientific community can deliver on that expectation."
Schwarzenegger underwent surgery on Tuesday morning to repair his right femur. The surgery, known as an open reduction internal fixation, lasted an hour and a half. At 10:45 a.m., Schwarzenegger's surgeons cleared him to resume his daily activities as governor.
"Recovery will take approximately eight weeks, and I expect the governor to fully recover," said Schwarzenegger's orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Kevin Ehrhart, in a statement released after the surgery. "The governor is not in a cast and will use crutches to walk while his leg heals."
Injury Likely Due to High Speed, Not Weak Bones
Contrary to the idea that frailty necessarily accompanies aging, older sports aficionados may still engage in demanding and potentially dangerous pastimes -- as long as they have kept themselves in pretty good shape.
"Fifty-nine is not old, but it's not 25," says Dr. John Messmer, associate professor at the Penn State College of Medicine in Palmyra, Pa. "However, a man who has been exercising regularly and generally is in good health should recover without issues.
"Skiing is an intrinsically dangerous sport," Messmer adds, "and such an injury as this could happen to anyone at any age."
However, since the exact nature of Schwarzenegger's injury has yet to be released, it is unknown exactly how he broke his leg. Also, his recovery could depend on health factors aside from his fractured femur.
"What I don't know about the governor is his other health," Messmer says. "I don't know if he has a family history of blood clots, for example, or his blood pressure or lipid level to know what sort of cardiovascular risk he has. I don't know what meds he takes."
The fashion in which he injured himself could also have implications for strains and other potential injuries in different parts of his body.
"With his muscle bulk, his bones should be strong," Messmer says. "If his bones are strong, the injury might have also affected his hip, knee or back. The force needed to fracture the femur would be transmitted to those areas."
Seniors Can Expect Slower Healing Rate
And though Schwarzenegger may make a full recovery, it is unlikely he will heal quite as quickly as he did in his "Conan the Barbarian" days.

Dear Foreign Investor  We Love Your Money  Not You!Tweet
Published on Thu, Dec 11,2014 | 19:29, Updated at Thu, Dec 11 at 19:30Source : Moneycontrol.com 
After almost a decade of political wrangling India seems set to enhance the foreign investment limit in insurance from 26% to 49%. If it happens, and the chances look good it will, Mr. Modi’s government will undoubtedly count this among its early victories. But is it really a victory? Does this limit enhancement represent this new Government’s economic approach ie: a more liberal foreign investment policy, more investment, more competition?
Maybe not. Because the hike in the FDI limit is likely to be accompanied by 2 caveats. The first one is endemic to our foreign investment policies…that ‘ownership and control’ should vest with Indians. That means 51% of the business should be owned by Indians and that Indians should have the right to appoint a majority of the directors or control the management or policy decisions. On the face of it there is nothing wrong in stipulating that insurance businesses must be controlled by Indians. But this restriction is in contradiction to that rationale for enhancing the FDI limit. In its representations to the Select Parliamentary Committee, the Ministry of Finance argued in favour of raising the FDI limit by saying India needs large amounts of capital and technology and know-how in the sector;
‘The Department of Financial Services further explained that the rationale behind increasing the FDI limit to 49% is that the Insurance Companies are regulated by stringent solvency norms and continuously require additional capital for growth, which partly get invested in key sectors like infrastructure. IRDA has estimated that the additional capital requirement of the insurance sector would be Rs. 55,000 crore (Rs.44,500 crores for the life sector and Rs. 10,500 crores for the non-life sector) over the next five years, which may not be taken care of by the limited domestic sources. Further, it was stated that the foreign equity potentially enables transfer of technical knowhow and better customer service through improved practices and competitive pressure. The FDI allowed in Insurance sector in other countries, the sectoral FDI limits existing in the country for other sectors and the key provisions proposed in the Bill for safeguarding the interests of the policy-holders were also highlighted. Giving specific instances of quantum of FDI in different countries, the Department submitted that it was 100 percent in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong; 80 percent in Indonesia and 50 percent in China.’
- Report of the Select Committee on the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008
So we want their money, their technology and their expertise…but we won’t give them control?
It isn’t the first time I have asked this question of foreign investment policy. The bureaucratic response often is – ‘but India is too important a market for them to ignore!’
I suppose we believe that no matter how unreasonable we are, the foreign investors will come. Well, Indian insurance businessmen, who do business with these foreign investors, think otherwise;
‘The representatives of the Private Sector Insurance Companies referring to the advantages of increase in FDI limit pointed out that insurance being a capital intensive and low return business, it is a better option to expose foreign capital to a low return industry, in place of scarce Indian capital. Foreign companies would also bring in latest technology and also provide access to global re-insurance market besides boosting infrastructure sector as the foreign capital would be invested in Government Securities and sectors as per IRDA guidelines…
The Private Sector representatives also stated that there may be hindrances to the amount of FDI coming in, if the full management control lies with the Indian shareholders as per the provisions of the Bill. It was suggested that while the FDI limit may be increased to 49 percent, there should be no provision for control and instead it should be left to the shareholders to sort out amongst themselves, based on their share holdings.’
- Report of the Select Committee on the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008
The Report includes dissent notes by some MPs and they cite the global financial crisis, investments in complex derivatives and AIG’s bailout by the US Government as instances why foreign insurance should not be trusted. But can’t those fears be mitigated by better regulation? 2 of our leading private banks are majority owned by foreign investors…yet we think of them as Indian banks and trust RBI to regulate them effectively. Can we not trust IRDA to do the same…effectively regulate Indian insurance companies, irrespective of the colour of money funding them? Maybe therein lies the trouble…it’s not the foreign investors we don’t trust…it’s the lack of confidence in our own regulatory structures?
Worst still the 49% limit includes FDI and FPI (earlier known as FII). This makes an IPO tough…because in an insurance company that already has a foreign partner, assuming the partner wants to own 49% or thereabouts , the headroom for portfolio investment will be zero or severely restricted. Oddly enough, the Select Committee acknowledges this but doesn’t resolve it.
‘The Committee also notes the views expressed by Secretary, Department of Financial Services that there is a requirement of huge amount of capital as defined by the regulator for stipulated solvency levels to maintain the trust level of stake holders in life insurance companies through solvency under all circumstances. This enhanced foreign equity will not only help in expansion of insurance coverage, comprehensive and better portfolio management, enable growth of pension sector but also potentially enable transfer of technical knowhow and other better consumer services through improved practices and competitive pressures. The Committee observed that IPOs may not be the best route for raising capital in the insurance sector as FIIs face constraints due to sectoral foreign equity caps.’
- Report of the Select Committee on the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008
As for the second caveat – the Select Committee wants the hike in the FDI limit to be accompanied by fresh capital.
‘The Committee is also of the view that incremental equity should ideally be used for expansion of capital base so as to actually strengthen the insurance sector.’
- Report of the Select Committee on the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008
Again, the intention is noble – insurance needs more capital and hence the guiding policy should enable the inflow of fresh capital. Hence the emphasis on primary issuance of shares and the bar on secondary transactions. But why should a law prescribe the nature of the investment transaction? Can we not leave this up to the 2 consenting adults to determine?
It is well known that over the last decade Indian insurance businesses often sought capital from their foreign partners. But because foreign ownership was limited to 26%, many foreign partners indirectly funded the business by funding the Indian promoter…in the hope that when the FDI limit is raised the money will convert to equity. This happened for a couple of reasons…Indian promoters didn’t have the money to invest in a growing, capital hungry business…or they didn’t have the risk appetite or they were getting the foreign funds cheap. Whatever the reasons, these structures and side letters (granting the foreign investor certain rights including conversion) were riding on the hope of a hike in the FDI limit. If the Committee’s caveat persists, many of these structures will have to be re-structured. That could put the foreign investor at a dis-advantage.
Conversely it may even hurt the Indian partner’s ability to exit (partially), discharge the foreign debt or invest his money elsewhere. Unless ofcourse the Indian partner had no intention of honouring the debt or side letters.
But even if all these silly structural complications are surmounted by lawyers and their hefty fees….and still more structures…the message this policy sends out to foreign investors is not flattering to India. That we want your money, your technology, your expertise, but we don’t trust your intentions and we will prescribe to you the exact manner in which you can invest. But we want your money…
A Committee member I spoke to explained that the only way to achieve political consensus in favour of raising the FDI limit, was to explain to legislators the urgent need for additional capital in the insurance business. That pitch, he said, is justified only if the policy ensures new capital comes in. Hence the proposed bar on secondary transactions.
I wonder…if the BJP had a majority in the Rajya Sabha as well…would the Committee have dropped this clause?
The other argument in favour of this restriction is that, in a secondary transaction (Indian promoter selling stake to foreign investor) only the Indian promoter stands to gain… and that is unacceptable.
Committee member Naresh Gujral admitted as much in his comment to CNBC TV18 when he said “the idea is to strengthen the companies and not give windfall gains to a few select individuals in this country. You recall that this is exactly what happened during 2G. There were a few individuals that gained. So we want money to go into the companies and not into the pocket of a few rich individuals.”
This grouse finds mention in the Committee Report as well. MP Derek O’Brien in his dissent note states “The Bill in its current form creates no impetus for increased foreign investments in the insurance sector to be channeled towards improving insurance coverage or social security for the poor. It is quite possible that a higher FDI cap will only result in Indian entities liquidating their stake, at several times their original investment, without any fresh investments coming in.”
Well, if the Committee’s recommendation makes it to the final law, Mr O’Brien has one less thing to complain about.
In summation – we want foreign investment, foreign technology, foreign expertise….but we won’t trust them with control, nor trust our regulators to regulate them effectively. But then we don’t want Indian businessmen to profit either. Definitely not make any ‘windfall gains’.
My grumblings aside, hopefully none of this will hurt India’s insurance sector. It’s a big market and its return potential will draw foreign money. That’s not the point. It’s about how we chose to craft our investment policies. If even a historic majority and a right wing Government can’t fix that…then nothing will.
PS: I’m not suggesting that the Committee recommendations will definitely make it to the law. They might if that’s the only way to get political consensus. Or they may not. Several lobbies are at work. This is merely a contemplation of our approach to foreign investment and an examination of how our legislators think.

Court Takes Ax to Insider Trading LegislationCourt Takes Ax to Insider Trading Legislation
 
Morning Money Memo:
A federal appeals court has overturned two insider trading convictions in a controversial ruling that could potentially hamper the government’s ability to prosecute financial crimes. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that trading based on insider information is not always illegal, and the government had not presented sufficient evidence to prosecute the two individuals. The decision provides a narrower definition for defendants to be found guilty of insider trading, ultimately tied to knowledge of the legality to which the information was disclosed. Prosecutors could push for the case to be reviewed, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The Uber Cabs has suspended all its services in New Delhi with effect from Thursday. Meanwhile, the company's Asia-Pacific head was grilled by the Delhi Police on Wednesday. He was asked to furnish documents on employee verification, the company's database, and documents pertaining to employees they hire.
A petition was filed in the Delhi High Court over Uber not having a grievance officer, which is mandatory for all cab companies.
The police also recovered the iPhone that was given to the accused driver by Uber. Delhi Police has filed an FIR against Uber for cheating and not following government orders.
Justice Usha Mehra, a member of Justice JS Verma panel on rape law, however, said none of the guidelines given by the panel have been implemented by the government. The panel was set up after horrific December 16 Delhi gangrape to identify lapses and fix responsibility.
Mehra said, "Nothing has changed since Nirbhaya case. The government hasn't followed any of our recommendations. Uber and the Transport Department are equally responsible. The coordination between traffic police and the transport Department is still lacking."

Medical students stage #WhiteCoats4BlackLives protests in response to Garner  Brown grand jury decisionsBy Abby Phillip December 11, 2014 Follow @abbydphillip

Medical students nationwide staged a “white coat die-in” on Wednesday as protests continued in the wake of grand jury decisions in the deaths of two black men,  Eric Garner and Michael Brown .
According to reports , students from dozens of schools participated in the protest. They carried signs that said “Black lives matter” and “#whitecoats4blacklives” and “Hands up, don’t shoot” and, in reference to Garner’s final words , “We can’t breathe.”
Last month, a grand jury in Missouri  declined to indict a white Ferguson police officer in the Aug. 9 shooting death of Brown, an unarmed black teenager. A week later , a grand jury in Staten Island decided not to indict a white New York Police Department officer in the chokehold death of Garner during an attempted arrest. Police said Garner was illegally selling untaxed cigarettes.
On Wednesday afternoon, demonstrators on multiple medical school campuses positioned themselves on the floors outside entryways and in halls, forming small seas of white jackets dotted with the messages of protest. Some held a moment of silence for 45 minutes in recognition of the 4 1/2 hours that Brown’s body remained in the street on Canfield Drive in Ferguson after he was killed.

CM Jitan Ram Manjhi calls for raising reservation limit to80%By: Press Trust of India | Motihari |
Posted: December 11, 2014 8:14 pm
Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi on Thursday called for raising the bar on reservation from present 49.5 per cent to 80 percent for OBCs, SC/STs and other sections of the population.
“The reservation (in government jobs and educational institutions) be hiked to 80 per cent to be in sync with the population benefiting from the incentive,” he told a public meeting during his civic reception at Banshidhar secondary school under Adapur block in Bihar’s east Champaran district.
The number of people (OBCs, SC/STs and other sections) benefitting from reservation system stood at 80 per cent of total population of Bihar, Manjhi said and mooted for reservation limit (at 49.5 per cent) to be raised to 80 percent to meet employment and educational aspirations of the
beneficiaries.
The Chief Minister, who himself hails from a Mahadalit Mushar caste, said he would work for building a consensus on the issue with like-minded parties and, if needed, may launch an agitation to press for the reservation bar to be raised to 80 per cent.
Manjhi said he has taken upon himself to build a consensus on the issue with like minded parties and spearhead a stir in this regard, if required.
He urged lawmakers of different parties to demand for raising reservation limit in the current winter session of Parliament.
Manjhi alleged the NDA government was discriminating against Bihar and claimed the state plan size as well as funds under the MNREGA, IAY and BRGF have been slashed considerably to derail development and welfare activities in the state.

58 Indian fishermen arrested in Pakistan for violating territorialwatersBy: Press Trust of India | Karachi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 8:03 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 8:17 pm
Fifty eight Indian fishermen were arrested on Thursday and their 11 boats seized by Pakistani authorities for allegedly violating the country’s territorial waters.
The Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (MSA) arrested them in the the Arabian Sea.
“They violated the territorial waters in the Arabian Sea despite several warnings by our patrol boats,” Ahmed Reza, an official with the agency, said.
He said the MSA had also seized 11 boats and handed over the arrested fishermen to the docks police.
“The fishermen will now be presented before a magistrate and can be sent to judicial custody,” a police official said.
Last month Pakistan had arrested 61 Indian fishermen and seized 11 boats and these fishermen are now languishing in Malir district central jail.
Ayub Khoso, a senior official of the Pakistan Fishermen Forum, said that it was time that the governments of Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka find a permanent solution to a major problem affecting the livelihood of the fishermen.
“The arrest of fishermen has now become a frequent matter in Indian, Pakistani and Sri Lankan territorial waters. In the absence of any clear demarcation in the Arabian Sea these poor fishermen don’t know where they are headed and land into jails in these countries,” Khoso said.
He said their boats also lacked the required modern technology for accurate navigation in the Arabian Sea specially at night.
Pakistan and India also release each other’s fishermen on regular basis.
Last month, Pakistani authorities released 35 Indian fishermen and a civilian from Malir jail while in May this year a total of 151 Indian fishermen were released as a goodwill gesture.
Relations between the two nations have been tense in recent times due to frequent violations on the Line of Control.

Uber regrets rape incident  lists measures for betterserviceBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |

Under attack over the alleged rape by one its drivers, internet-based taxi firm Uber on Friday apologised and said it will assist authorities to help bring the accused to justice as it expressed hope of operating in the city again.
“We are sorry and deeply saddened by what happened over the weekend in New Delhi. Our hearts go out to the victim of this horrible crime. We have been and will continue to do everything in our power to assist the authorities to help bring the perpetrator to justice,” Uber said in a statement issued.
The US-based company further said that events of the week have made it look into its operations in India and they are taking a number of important actions.
“Firstly, we are conducting a full audit of our verification, rider feedback and support processes. We are implementing measures to ensure that critical rider feedback is escalated immediately and immediate action is taken in every instance. We are also re-reviewing rider feedback on every driver partner across India to make sure nothing has been missed.
“Second, we are assessing all driver screening processes. We are evaluating additional screening options to include background checks on all our driver partners in India and third, we will also bring in our global best practices where it would enhance our India safety efforts,” the detailed statement said.
Uber, which has been banned from operating in Delhi by the government, also said they will partner closely with organisations that are championing women’s safety here in the city and around the country.
Uber also expressed hope of operating in the city again and serve Delhiites.
“Your support means a lot to us. We will come back better and stronger for the New Delhi community, ready to serve you again,” said Uber.

AutoNation tries new online selling modelAutoNation takes on online selling venture

Joe Raedle, Getty Images
AutoNation (AN), the country’s largest auto dealership chain, is unveiling a new Web portal that takes aim at online car sellers and research sites.
It’s called SmartChoice Express, in which auto shoppers can research the inventory at AutoNation dealerships, find a vehicle they like and obtain its no-haggle price. Then, the vehicle is put on hold at the dealership where it is kept in reserve for 48 hours until a customer comes down for a test drive.
The portal is a sharp contrast to the way the traditional auto dealer business has operated for decades. Customers had to come to dealerships, then haggle over price in order to reach a deal. The rise of sites like Edmunds.com, Kbb.com and Cars.com, however, has dramatically changed the business by adding transparency to pricing. With customers more aware of pricing when they walk in the door, there has been less room to haggle and more incentive to move to a new model.
The launch of SmartChoice Express hasn’t hurt AutoNation stock, which was trading early Thursday at about %59.40 a share, up about 70 cents or 1.19%, still not far off its 52-week high of $61.29.

CB Exchange: Big rally fades
Oil broke $60 today, and that caused traders to start to sell. The market was up over 200 points and those gains have dropped significantly. With Jim Lowell, Adviser Investments; Phil Blancato, Ladenburg Thalmann; Heather Hughes, SunAmerica Funds; and Erik Ristuben, Russell Investments.
U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday, cutting weekly losses, but euphoria over increased retail sales in November faded as oil fell to another five-year low and renewed worries of a government shutdown.
Stocks finished far off session highs, with Wall Street starting to dial back gains after crude dropped below $60 a barrel, and the pullback escalated amid efforts to block a spending bill in the House , sparking worries of the government closing.
"It's a combination of oil dipping below key support levels and trepidation over Washington's inability to get something accomplished," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.
Stocks had rallied, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging as much as 225 points, after figures from the Commerce Department had retail sales rising 0.7 percent last month, the largest increase in eight months.
"The consumer is absolutely feeling better. Their homes are worth more, their 401ks are worth more, and they are paying less at the gas pump; holiday spending is doing much better than I would have guessed six months ago,"  said Patty Edwards, managing director for investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
"We've been expecting lower gas prices were going to help the consumer, and that is obviously bearing out. On the electronics side, people are buying gadgets. The other thing I've been saying is that people are staying in their homes, and spending at big-box home-improvement retailers," Edwards added.
"Retail sales are driving things, they were very strong," said Chris Gaffney, senior market strategist at EverBank Wealth Management.
"This movement today to me crystallizes that investors are starting to believe that the equity market can stand on its own, that it's not necessarily dependent on the Fed," Gaffney added of the Federal Reserve, and concerns about what would occur once the U.S. central bank begins raising benchmark interest rates.
After the stronger-than-expected retail report, the National Retail Federation told CNBC its forecast "is right on track" for a 4.1 percent sales growth this holiday season.
"The lower oil prices are good for the global economy. It's not good for the energy sector, down nearly 15 percent year to date, and that is a drag on the broader market, but lower gas prices are good for the consumer. A second thing it does is keep inflation expectations lower, which gives the Fed more room to keep rates lower for longer," said Gaffney.
Separately, the Labor Department reported fewer Americans filed unemployment claims last week.

Here are some ads that dared to do things differently
Some advertisements have got a thumbs-up from advertising and marketing professionals for being the flag bearers in changing the portrayal of women in Indian advertisements. Here’s a sampling.
Airtel - Wife as Boss
One respondent called it the best example of the woman of today being a multi-tasker, the one who can be both a tough boss and also a caring and loving wife. Another respondent called it refreshing on the backdrop of a feudalistic society. Others gave it a hurrah for putting the woman in charge.
Tanishq – Remarriage ad
It broke away from the stereotype. The concept of remarriage of a girl in a traditional way in the presence of family members is a refreshing change, said one respondent. Another respondent said the ad deserved applause for more reasons like putting a dark complexioned woman as the protagonist and also showing her having a girl child from her previous marriage in the storyline.
Bournvita – Boxing aspirations
The line between the father and mother is blurring as women are no more identified as emotional beings but capable of taking independent and tough decisions, was one response to the ad. Another called it a victory for the girl child who is no longer restricted to certain fields.
Havells – Hawa Badlegi
It was a humorous take on the situation in Indian families and the voices of women calling for change.
It shows women voicing their opinions against expectations from men in an aggressive manner.
Bharat Matrimony-Career choice
It highlights the importance of men changing their outlook towards women and embracing the woman’s right to follow her dreams.
Nirma-Women to the rescue

Retirees  Golden Years Tarnished by Low SavingsRetirees' golden years tarnished by low savings
Kelli B. Grant CNBC

Retiree dreams of lengthy vacations, days on the golf course and indulging  the grandkids may be dust.
Most retirees haven't saved enough even to maintain their pre-retirement  lifestyle, according to a new study from Interest.com based on Census Bureau  data. The rule of thumb among financial planners is saving to have a retirement  income of at least 70 percent of your working-days salary.

Most retirees haven't saved enough to maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle, according to a new study.
Only residents of Washington, D.C., and Nevada are exceeding that mark, with  the typical retiree's wage replacement ratio at 73.81 percent and 70.78 percent,  respectively. Nationwide, residents age 65 and older are living on a median  income of $37,847, for a wage replacement ratio of 59.63 percent. The bulk of  that income is from Social Security, rather than savings.
That makes for big changes from a working lifestyle, said Mike Sante,  managing editor of Interest.com. Not only might there be no trips abroad, but  seniors may also find it a struggle to meet regular expenses or create a cushion  for emergencies or medical needs. "It's a pretty limited income for someone to  live on," he said.
By the numbers, retirees are slightly more prepared than in 2011, when the  wage replacement ratio was 57.41 percent, or in 2005, when it was 50.06 percent.  But the bulk of that improvement stems from older adults staying in the  workforce longer, said Sante, which he called "a strategy with an expiration  date."
"I hear that a lot from people," said certified financial planner Andrea  Blackwelder, co-founder of Wisdom Wealth Strategies in Denver. "They say, 'If  the numbers don't work, then I'll work for a couple more years.' That choice may  not be in your hands."

Among retirees in a 2013 survey from the Society of Actuaries, 21 percent  cited health problems as a reason they left the workforce, while 13 percent left  because they needed to care for a family member. Another 13 percent lost their  job. 
In other words, working longer may be one option, but it shouldn't be the  only strategy you employ—and definitely not the one you count on.
Even with just few years to go before retiring, boosting  contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts can have a significant  impact, said Marilyn Plum, a certified financial planner and director of  portfolio management at Ballou Plum Wealth Advisors in Lafayette, California.  (Keep in mind, workers age 50 and older can make catch-up contributions of an  extra $5,500 in a 401(k) and $1,000 in an IRA.)

That 70 percent wage replacement benchmark is also worth revisiting. There's  a lot of flexibility in that number , said Blackwelder. "It's  a fine place to start," she said. "But people shouldn't assume that if they hit  70 percent, they're good to go."
You might be able to get by on less, especially if you expect big changes  from current expenses—say, you'll have paid off your mortgage,  won't have commuting and other work expenses, or you plan to move somewhere with  a lower cost of living. Of course, you might need more than 70 percent of  current wages, too, to fuel travel plans and other expensive hobbies, said Plum.  
"Our clients want to live the same lifestyle they have always lived," she  said. "They don't want to cut back 30 percent just because they're in  retirement."

Hunting for the Best Deal Stores Boost Price-MatchingEmail
Holiday shoppers want more than low prices. They want to know they’ve gotten the very lowest price. That’s why so many stores now have price matching policies and why some big name retailers have expanded their programs this holiday season.
Best Buy, Target and Wal-Mart stores will now match prices from some online competitors – including Amazon – and from their own websites. That’s a big change. In the past, most retailers excluded their own web prices from their price match policies – something that infuriated customers who couldn’t understand why.
JONATHAN ALCORN / Reuters
Residents shop at Wal-Mart as the store prepares for Black Friday in Los Angeles, California.
Wal-Mart has become the leader in price matching . It will now match prices from 30 online sites – including  Best Buy, Kohl’s, Sears, Target and Toys R Us – as well as prices on its own website.
“People are busy and they want to get in and out of the store and know that if they see a better price at another store, that it will be matched,” said John Forrest Ales, director of corporate communications at Wal-Mart.
Stores that price-match eCommerce sites hope to reduce “showrooming” – when someone comes into the store, checks out a product and then buys it online. They want to encourage shoppers to do what’s been dubbed “webrooming” – browse online and then make the purchase at the store.
“Retailers hate showrooming,” said Mark LoCastro, director of public relations at DealNews.com . “This year they are going to do everything possible to make sure you buy from them, whether it’s in their physical store or on their website.” (Deal News has compiled a Black Friday Price Matching Guide .)
Video: Former U.S. Secret Service agent Evy Poumpouras joins TODAY to offer ways to safeguard yourself in stores this Black Friday, including keeping water and a flashlight in your purse and only shopping with a credit card, ID and cash.
Is price matching a marketing gimmick?
Price matching is a simple way for retailers to build confidence in their brand.
“It lets people feel good about the price they’re paying and not go and search for a lower price, so they feel more comfortable with the transaction,” said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. “To offer this guarantee a store must have good prices, but they don’t have to have the lowest price on everything.”
Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group , is an expert on consumer behavior. He says customers like to shop where there’s a price-match guarantee, and retailers know most of them won’t bother to ask for a price adjustment.  
“Shoppers want to know that the store offers it, but they don’t know how to go about asking for it,” Cohen told NBC News. “Very few people are versed in the skill to be able to ask for a discount or have the nerve to ask for one.”
Research done by the NDP Group indicates that only five percent of shoppers feel comfortable asking for a price match. During the holiday shopping season, when it’s all about the deal, that jumps to about 50 percent.
“If they get it great, if not, they may buy it anyway, just so they don’t have to go to another store,” Cohen said.
Know how to play the price-match game
If you do your homework, know the store’s policy and have the courage to ask, you may be able to use a store’s low-price guarantee to save some money on your holiday purchases.
Remember, price-match policies have limitations and qualifications. Find out what they are. Which competitors are covered? Does it include online retailers? Does it include the store’s own website? Is it limited to certain merchandise? Are there days – like Black Friday weekend or Cyber Monday – when the price match doesn’t apply? What proof will you need?
Edgar Dworsky, super shopper and founder of the website ConsumerWorld.org , cautions that some retailers make it difficult to get a price adjustment.
“At some stores, the sales clerks make you feel like it’s coming out of their own pocket,” Dworsky said. “They’re trying to protect the company from that bad consumer who wants to get a lower price.” (Dworsky has published his Top 10 Tips to Bag a Bargain on Black Friday Week.)
The way to win at the price-match game is to understand the rules and have legitimate proof of the competitor’s lower price – that means the original newspaper ad or circular.
Video: Retailers are using the technology to get information on how long you spend in each part of the store, which helps them with store layout and product placement.
Using screen shots of online ads to make your case could be harder this year after what happened at Wal-Mart last week. A few customers created fake web pages to scam Wal-Mart into selling them $400 video game machines for less than $100.
You can get around that by using your smartphone to check web prices while you’re at the store. Do a search with a site like Price Grabber , Shopzilla , Shopping.com , or Google Shopping . And don’t forget to check the site for the store you’re standing in – it could have a lower price. If you find a lower price anywhere, ask them to match it. You’ve got nothing to lose.
Sometimes you can get price adjustments after the sale
Price matching typically takes place at the time of sale. You need to have proof of that lower price before the transaction is completed. But some retailers offer a price adjustment for a limited time after the sale. Black Friday and Cyber Monday prices are typically excluded.
Another option is to use a credit card that offers price-protection coverage. If the price of the item you bought goes down at that store within a certain time period (typically 60 or 90 days), you can file a claim and the credit card company will refund the difference.

Here s Srinivasan s new trickMore
Srinivasan agrees to stay away from IPL if elected BCCI president
The note said that another term of reference for the proposed committee would be to "consider and suggest a mechanism to identify the potential conflict of interest in the BCCI and to suggest the procedure to be adopted for dealing with situations of potential conflict of interest."

N. Srinivasan, the Indian cricket board's sidelined chief, Wednesday told the Supreme Court that if he is re-elected, he would stay away from the Indian Premier League (IPL) governing council till a proposed committee decides on the larger question of conflict of between his BCCI role and his IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings.
Responding to a poser from the court Tuesday, senior counsel Kapil Sibal told a bench of Justice T.S. Thakur and Justice F.M.I. Kalifulla that Srinivasan would stay away from the governing council and its activities and also from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) meetings related to the IPL.
N. SrinivasanSibal said: "Mr. N. Srinivasan, further undertakes that if he is elected as president of BCCI, till the (proposed) committee suggests the procedure to deal with the issue of conflict of interest, he will not attend any IPL governing council meeting or any other IPL related discussion in ant meeting of working committee or general body meeting of the BCCI."
This the court was told in a note on the scope of reference of the committee to be appointed by the apex court or the BCCI into the question of conflict of interest. The note said the committee could suggest "the sanctions to be imposed, in accordance with the applicable IPL rules on person prima facie found to be involved in the act of backing by the Mudgal Committee."
The committee may also determine the liability of the franchisees for the act of backing by their "team officials and to suggest the consequential sanctions that can be imposed on them in accordance with the IPL rules."
The note said that another term of reference for the proposed committee would be to "consider and suggest a mechanism to identify the potential conflict of interest in the BCCI and to suggest the procedure to be adopted for dealing with situations of potential conflict of interest."
Sibal said this during the hearing on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by Cricket Association of Bihar which has sought to oust Srinivasan as BCCI president on the ground of his being in the conflict of interest situation being the president of the cricketing body and also the owner of CSK.
The PIL is also seeking the cancellation of IPL franchisee CSK on the ground of Srinivasan's son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan's alleged involvement in betting.

Why (Another) Urban Outfitters Fiasco Still Makes Me Angryreddit
Oh, Urban Outfitters, why haven't you learned?
I'm not surprised. Instead, I am chronically disillusioned by their previous appropriation of culture ( Native and Indigenous ) and religion ( Judaism and Hinduism ). This time, they target a hegemonic understanding of South Asian culture by inviting employees to wear turbans, saris, and harem pants to a holiday party, as reported in the Huffington Post . This is ostensibly to Urban Outfitters not a big deal, rather another symptom of systemic, insidious racism.
Many South Asian folks will say, "I'm (insert South Asian identity) and I don't find that offensive!" These comments are not race-conscious and not critically informed. One person cannot speak on behalf of an entire community, nor can one person forgive all acts of historical exploitation. Prejudices and discrimination are racist if it is supported by systems of power (institutions like corporations, governments, etc.). Wearing a turban, sari, or harem pants to a holiday party for a major corporation supports systems that oppress South Asian people and is therefore racist.
As a Punjabi Sikh, when I wear traditional clothing, I am othered, ogled, and hyper-visible to the point of feeling uncomfortable and anxious (and no, this is not specific to my hometown). When non-Brown folks wear the same clothing, they are hip, "bohemian," or culturally aware. My family and community members who chose to keep their hair have had significant concerns when donning a dastaar, a Sikh turban, to work or school, concerned that they will be a target for physical or verbal violence, given the marginalization they've experienced when adopting a physical Sikh identity in their homeland, America. When non-Sikhs wear a turban in a party setting, they are appreciating the culture, expressing themselves, or just having fun.
There is a simultaneous push and pull. Sikhs, particularly those of Punjabi descent, are pushed to assimilate and conform to white, western beauty standards and dress. At the same time, cultural signifiers are pulled -- used by Urban Outfitters and others to make profit and minimized to a costume that one can simply take off at the end of the night. Those signifiers are often abstracted, sexualized, and only acceptable on white bodies. Our dress comes from a legacy of marginalization, generations of resistance, yet renders us targets of violence, as we saw in the 2012 shooting at a Sikh house of worship, a gurdwara, in Oak Creek, Wisconsin . We lost six community members on that day.
Why then, should we care about Urban Outfitters hosting a racist, appropriative party when there is police brutality and racial profiling? Because this is another example of how racism manifests. This is not about demonizing Urban Outfitters. It is about refusing to support entities that actively engage in racism via cultural appropriation. It is about holding individuals, organizations, and systems accountable. It is about learning to apologize and correcting behavior. It is about respecting and acknowledging that at the end of the day, I cannot take off my brown skin. Cultural exchange is possible, but it requires engagement, humility, and respect, none of which are present in Urban Outfitters' party.

Leaders -- Too Cool for Schoolreddit
If you want to enjoy long-term success as a leader, you should think of yourself as a perpetual student. You may be nodding in agreement. However, opening up to a new, curious mindset is not an easy thing. For most of us, true change takes time and commitment. It is far easier doing the same things that we already know, that we've always done.
But doing the same things over and over again is not so smart. The ability to question, to learn new things and to change comes in handy in today's business environment. Things are happening fast these days. The market, the technology, and the people who work for you are not going to stand still even if you choose to do so.
The cost of not running along can be high if you have ambitions of hanging in there. Not only that, as a leader it shouldn't be just about "hanging in there." You should be sitting in the front seat of the bus. Driving into new territories. Being at the forefront of your own and your team's development.
The thing is that everyone at the top should be a constant learner. It boils down to a very simple question: If I continue to do exactly what I do today, will I succeed tomorrow?
Yep - we know this might sound self-serving since we are in the business of teaching leaders how to become successful leaders for the future. But, the same rule applies to both of us:
If we want to stay at the top of our game, we have to stay curious and keep on learning. There's no such thing as 'too cool for school'.
Here are three steps to get back into that learning environment:
Start thinking of yourself as a perpetual student. Be curious; listen to people, especially the younger ones. Is there anything in their behavior you do not understand? Go adventure hunting in your own world. Why is it you cannot understand them? What is your approach to overcome that? It's been said that becoming an expert requires 10,000 hours of practice. But what matters more is what you do with your hours.
Acknowledge your learning style and schedule. It's a world of teaching-environments out there; weekend courses, graduate programs, on-line courses, books to read, you name it. Focus on what works for you, what inspires you and help you grow as a leader. Choose a format that sparks your interest for learning.
Find your tribe, share your passion. Join online communities of like-minded people. The online world is an awesome place for the never ending learner. Tap into the collective intelligence of your tribe, and let the learning start.
What do you do to stay on top of the game? We would love to hear what worked for you.

Black Teenager Taken Out Of School And Jailed For A Month Without Probable Cause  Lawsuit ClaimsBlack Teenager Taken Out Of School, Jailed For Month Without Probable Cause, Lawsuit Says
Posted:
reddit
In September, police took a 17-year-old African-American boy out of high school in Cincinnati, Ohio, and arrested him on the suspicion that he had participated in an armed mugging. There was no evidence connecting him to the alleged crime, his public defender contended, save that the alleged victim brought the boy's Facebook photo to the police. The charges were dismissed, but only after the boy spent a month in detention, including time in isolation, according to a lawsuit filed last month.
The class-action lawsuit, filed on behalf of juvenile plaintiffs against two officials at Hamilton County juvenile court system, claims that the boy's case is part of a systematic problem in Hamilton County -- and possibly throughout Ohio -- where officials authorize warrants for arrest and incarceration without probable cause determination, which has a disproportionate impact on black children. The lawsuit also is filed against the Hamilton County Board of County Commissioners.
Pamela Matthews, 46, the legal guardian of the boy, "S.W.", said that when she heard her son had been taken out of history class and put in jail, "I assumed it was a joke; I started laughing." Her son is a good student with no juvenile criminal record, according to his sworn court testimony, and Matthews said that he had a solid alibi: "He was at home, asleep."
According to the Cincinnati Police Department incident report filed on Sept. 7, the victim claimed that he was robbed by three teenagers, one of whom was described as having "dreads with blonde tips," and the other two of whom are only listed as being male and black and wearing certain clothing.
Ali Hatheway, a senior trial attorney at the Hamilton County Public Defender's office who handled S.W.'s criminal case and is not involved with the lawsuit, told The Huffington Post that "he didn't even fit the physical description."
"There was nothing, other than what this kid was saying," Hatheway said, calling the case "one of the worst ones I've handled with there being a lack of probable cause." She added, "Here it does happen a lot, where you can just go down to the juvenile detention center and say, 'Hey, so-and-so threatened to kill me' ... and now there's a warrant."
According to Matthews, the only evidence provided to her by law enforcement was a photo of S.W. standing in Matthews' mother's laundry-room, making a gun gesture with his fingers, which the alleged victim's family found on Facebook.
The detective who worked on the case and the police officer who filed the initial report did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
According to the lawsuit, in 2013, African-American children in the county were almost 10 times more likely to be arrested than white children, and two times more likely to be placed in secure detention. The complaint alleges that the court did not make a probable cause determination for S.W. during the 30 days he spent in detention, not attending his high school.
"I was very scared because I thought no one would believe I was innocent," S.W. testified.
On Oct. 10, a judge dismissed S.W.'s case "on the merits," according to court documents. Hatheway said the alleged victim's story fell apart. "I think it was a situation where he came in late at two in the morning and he didn't want to get in trouble, so he made up this story about getting robbed, and it just snowballed," Hatheway said.
Curtis Kissinger, the court administrator for the Hamilton County Juvenile Court, said that juveniles typically get a hearing within 24 hours with a defense attorney present, where police statements are reviewed. "There's no testimony being taken at that first hearing," he said. After that, there are additional weekly reviews of youth in detention, although he noted, "We don't go into an assessment of the truthfulness of the allegations; we don't delve into potential guilt" at those reviews.
Kissinger said that while he couldn't comment on S.W.'s case in particular, he pointed out that the court is "following state law and the rules promulgated by the Ohio Supreme Court." He added, "The plaintiffs have an issue with those rules."
Indeed, the lawsuit notes that, "Ohio law does not explicitly require a probable cause finding at a detention hearing," although the detention must be "constitutionally valid." Jill Beeler-Andrews, chief counsel of the Ohio Public Defender Office's Juvenile Division, told the Gongwer News Service that judges not taking probable cause under consideration during detainment hearings "is happening pretty regularly throughout the state."
Last year, over 6,000 children were arrested in Hamilton County, about 40 percent of them detained in the Hamilton County Juvenile Court Youth Center. The daily cost of holding each child is $221, according to the Children's Law Center, which filed the case.
Matthews told The Huffington Post she's bringing the lawsuit because, "I definitely hope this doesn't happen to other kids." She added, "It broke my heart to see [S.W.] in shackles and handcuffs."

Google News to shut down in Spain over  Google Tax  on Dec 16By: Associated Press | Madrid |
Posted: December 11, 2014 10:01 am | Updated: December 11, 2014 10:54 am
Google said Thursday it will shut down its Google News service in Spain to prevent publishers’ content from appearing on it – ahead of a new law requiring the Internet search company to pay Spanish news organizations for linked content or snippets of news.
The move marks the first time globally that Google Inc. will shutter Google News and comes ahead of a new Spanish intellectual property law going into effect Jan. 1 nicknamed the “Google Tax.”
The company’s News product for Spain will stop linking content from Spanish publishers and close on Dec. 16, Google said in a statement.
The law did not specify how much publishers would have to be paid by Google. Spain’s AEDE group of news publishers lobbied for the law nicknamed the “Google Tax” and Google said publishers would be forced to charge the company “for showing even the smallest snippets of their content – whether they want to charge or not.”
“As Google News shows no ads and makes no revenue, this approach is simply unsustainable,” Google said. Google News has long rankled newspaper publishers and other content providers who contend the service tramples on copyrights by creating a digital kiosk of headlines and story snippets gathered from other websites.
Most venting has been limited to criticism likening Google to a freeloader, but there have been attempts to force the company to change its ways through courts.
Google maintains it obeys all copyright laws while sending more people to websites highlighted in its News services. The company also allows publishers to prevent material from being displayed in Google News, an option few websites choose because the service is an important traffic source to sell ads.
After Germany revised copyright laws last year in a way that could have required Google News to make royalty payments, Google required publishers to give consent for summarizing content and most did.
Europe’s highest court this year ruled that people have a right to scrub unflattering or outdated information from Google’s search engine. That case started in Spain.

Govt ready to debate banning conversions after Agra controversyComments
The government offered to bring a law on religious conversion amid opposition pressure in Parliament on Thursday over the Agra controversy and tension in Aligarh and other sensitive areas where hard-line Hindu groups were aggressively pushing ahead their “reconversion” programmes.

“The government is ready to discuss and build a consensus on having a legislation on (religious) conversion,” parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said in the Lok Sabha after Opposition MPs shouted slogans demanding a debate and an adjournment motion on the Agra incident in which 57 poor Muslim families were apparently tricked to switch to Hinduism at a camp hosted by the Dharam Jagaran Samiti and the Bajrang Dal.
The Opposition also demanded an adjournment motion, saying incidents like the one in Agra could ignite riots. “They (organisers of religious conversions) are bringing the country a bad name and sowing seeds of poison,” said Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge.
When Parliament was debating the situation arising out of the Agra incident, an explosive letter surfaced in Agra in which Dharam Jagran Samiti leader Rajeshwer Singh has outlined the target, expenditure and achievement of his organisation to its cadre.
Setting a goal of 50 events this year to convert 100,000 Muslims and Christians, the letter seeks donations to go ahead with its proposed programmes, called ghar wapsi or homecoming ceremonies.
It calls for help from each volunteer to at least fund one event, saying Rs. 5 lakh is required to “reconvert” a Muslim while expenses on problems related to a Christian come to Rs. 2 lakh.
The letter says such ceremonies have “brought back” to Hinduism 40,000 people, including 2,000 Muslims, in 20 districts.
In communally-sensitive Aligarh, the Dharam Jagaran Samiti and the VHP announced their plan to “reconvert” 5,000 Christians and 1,000 Muslims at a function on Christmas.
They said Hindus would be appealed to welcome the “reconverted” Muslims and Christians, who had apparently switched faith from Hinduism some time in history.
Firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, who is the MP for Gorakhpur, and other senior leaders of RSS and VHP offshoots are likely to attend the programme to be held on a college campus.
The Hindu Yuva Vahini that Adityanath had floated, too, has a plan to convert over 2,000 people at a similar programme at Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh on December 18.
Muslim groups and political parties not aligned with the BJP demanded the governments at the Centre and the state to restrain the radical Hindu outfits .
Security in Aligarh was strengthened to prevent any violence. Senior superintendent of police J Ravindra Gaud promised swift action on any complaint of forced conversion.

Devendra Fadnavis announces Rs 7 000 cr package for drought-hit areasDevendra Fadnavis
(The electricity bills of…)
NAGPUR: The Maharashtra government today announced a Rs 7,000 crore package for the parched Vidarbha and Marathwada regions of the state, grappling with drought-like conditions.
The electricity bills of farmers of drought-affected areas will also be waived, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told the state Assembly.
"The government stands behind the farmers who are in distress due to drought-like situation prevailing in parts of Vidarbha and Marthwada and a total of Rs 7,000 crore would be spent to tackle it," Fadnavis said.
Admitting lapses on the part of the government in checking suicide by farmers, he said it was a matter of "shame" for any dispensation.
Winding up a two-day debate on drought and farmers' suicides, he said the state government will repay crop loans taken from licensed private money lenders.
Nearly five lakh farmers from the affected areas have taken such loans, he said.
The state government will provide financial assistance of Rs 3,925 crore to the farmers affected by drought in districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada, he said.
The package includes Rs 884 crore for horticulture sector spread over 2.45 lakh hectares, Rs 215 crore for paying electricity bills, Rs 425 crore for water supply and Rs 163 crore for wells and private water bodies, Fadnavis said.
The state government has already initiated steps to check illegal money lending, Fadnavis said and asked the farmers to lodge complaint with concerned civil and police authorities to stop such activity.
Maintaining that water scarcity will be tackled firmly, the Chief Minister said Rs 400 crore would be spent on it. Around 3,000 tankers will be deployed to supply water in drought-hit villages till the situation improves, he said.
The government will also ensure uninterrupted power supply to the farmers and will waive their electricity bills for the September-November quarter as a temporary arrangement, the Chief Minister said.
"I have announced a Rs 7000 crore package as immediate relief for drought-hit farmers of the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions. 50 lakh hectares will be brought under permanent irrigation. We aim to make 5000 villages drought-free over the next year," he later told reporters.
The government, Fadnavis said, has also initiated an exercise to replace 2,700 transformers that are out of order of which 2,200 have already been changed with high-powered ones.
Farmers having illegal connections whose applications are pending will be provided regular power connections on the spot, he said.
The Chief Minister said the government has also decided to reschedule crop loans of Rs 8,000 crore taken by farmers from District Central Co-Operative Banks and nationalised banks.
Fadnavis attributed continuing incidents of farmers' suicide to falling cotton productivity in the state which was the lowest among nine states producing the crop. He stressed upon the need to find ways to raise cotton productivity.
  State Revenue Minister and the Leader of Legislative Council, Eknath Khadse said the special relief package of Rs 7,000 crore is a short term measure and the government is planning a long-term strategy to tackle drought-like conditions.
"Such packages are for short term. We have to plan long term to develop infrastructure in the state to tackle drought-like situation," he said in the Upper House while replying to the debate on farmers' suicide and scarcity conditions initiated by Manikrao Thakre of Congress.
"The government has decided to take a serious note of the drought situation in the state and has decided to provide help to farmers in various ways," Khadse said in his reply.
Stressing that the financial aid announced today is a "temporary arrangement", the senior BJP leader said, "There should be a provision of long term planning and we are working in that direction.
"We have to develop such infrastructure for future where we will not have to face drought-like conditions. Presently, Maharashtra has advances of Rs 3,25,000 crore and revenue deficit of Rs 26,000 crore. But, we have to support farmers by all means," the minister said.
However, the opposition Congress and NCP criticised the package.
"It will not provide any direct benefit to farmers cultivating cotton, soybean, paddy and sugarcane. This is not at all a sound package," Thakre said.
Interestingly, while Thakre announced that Congress is boycotting the proceedings the members stayed put.
NCP's Sunil Tatkare termed the package as an "insult" to 12 crore people of Maharashtra, saying, "there is nothing new (in the package) for farmers."
NCP members rushed to the Well and started shouting slogans: "Give Justice, Give Justice".
As the din continued, Chairman Shivajirao Deshmukh adjourned the proceedings for 30 minutes.

Direct selling industry seeks uniform central regulationDirect selling industry seeks uniform central regulation
Our Bureau
Tweet
Hyderabad, Dec 11:  
The Indian Direct Selling Association today highlighted the need for a Central Government-driven uniform policy framework to govern the functioning of the Rs 7,500-crore industry, which is now passing through tough times due to different line of thinking in some states against the industry.
The industry, which closed last financial year with business volume of Rs 7,472 crore, up from Rs 7,184 crore in 2012-13 and Rs 6,385 crore in 2011-12, has potential to grow at a much faster pace provided there is consistency in the regulatory norms across the country, Chavi Hemanth, Secretary General, IDSA, said.
Chavi Hemanth said the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Government of India has constituted an inter-ministerial group on December 8 to look into the regulatory issues concerning the direct selling industry. “We expect the Ministry would come out with appropriate regulations for the industry which was affected in some States taking tough stand,” she said.
Outlining the sector issues, she said of the Rs 7,472 crore business last year, the organised sector contributed about Rs 7,024 crore and the unorganised sector Rs 448 crore. Amway, HerbalLife, Oriflame, Tupperware and Avon are among the top direct selling brands in the country.
She said Bengaluru topped the cities in terms of overall business, followed by Delhi, Ludhiana and Mumbai. However, Hyderabad continued to be in top 10 slot, but its overall position slipped from six to eight last year.
Referring to States such as Kerala, where direct selling companies have closed their business and also tough regulations in States like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, she felt the Centre needed to take lead and come out with a comprehensive policy to regulate the direct selling industry, which has potential to grow by more than 10 per cent per annum over the next few years. It could further accelerate if the regulatory hurdles were sorted out, she felt.

McDonald's slimming down menu as it tries to fatten up sales
McDonald's will slim down an admittedly bloated menu and try to eliminate preservatives from its food as part of a broad push to stem what its CEO on Wednesday called the "erosion" of sales in its U.S. business.
The world's largest restaurant company has to be more nimble to keep up with competitors that have been quicker to respond to customers' tastes, executives said during an investor conference at the company's Oak Brook headquarters. That means everything from speeding up internal tests and doing more to appeal to diners who are looking for cleaner labels on what they eat, to having franchisees do more community outreach.

McDonald's food you can't get here

McDonald's food you can't get here
It's been 59 years since McDonald's became synonymous with burgers and fries in the U.S. Now it has more than 34,000 stores in 118 countries. Here's what you can find at Mickey D's around the world:
"We are not going to re-energize this business by taking incremental steps," said Mike Andres, who became president of McDonald's USA two months ago.
The updates outlined by Andres and CEO Don Thompson include removing eight items from a menu with more than 100 food items and dozens of drinks, and trimming the number of Extra Value Meals to 11 from 16. Such moves could make it easier for customers to figure out what they want to order while also reducing complexity in the kitchen.
The company has been testing the streamlined menu in Delaware; Little Rock, Ark.; Waco, Texas; Bakersfield, Calif.; Macon, Ga., and Knoxville, Tenn., a spokeswoman said.
8
The menus, for example, offer one Quarter Pounder with cheese, rather than four versions; one Snack Wrap instead of three; and one Premium Chicken sandwich instead of three. The company would not confirm which items will be eliminated from the menu in January, though Andres said a version of a McWrap could be on the chopping block.
The McWrap, in particular, has been flagged as an item that often takes too long to prepare.
How fast the changes can be executed is key, one analyst said. On Monday, McDonald's posted its worst monthly U.S. sales in more than 13 years.
"The early response from consumers is encouraging, but it's going to take time to execute," said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy, who attended the meeting.
@poppy coq Agree that sitting down is a preferred way to eat a meal. McDonalds is not for that. It is for a quick bite on the run. Agree for a quality meal, I am not going to McDonalds.

McDonald's has been trying to shake up the U.S. organization for several quarters, as sales have suffered while rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chick-fil-A and others post gains. In October, McDonald's wooed Andres back to run the business, marking the second change in the high-profile spot in less than two years.
Andres said that adding more than 100 items to the menu over the past decade helped increase sales, touting that the items added $770,000 to sales at an average restaurant. However, the more complex menu also made it difficult for restaurants to execute "and maybe difficult to order," he said.
The company already announced a new, four-zone organizational structure for the U.S. business as it wants to let local operators make more of their own decisions. Now, Andres is mapping out seven broad plans, ranging from improving the internal culture to creating what the company is calling the McDonald's of the future.
Andres pledged that McDonald's would also offer food that is "more culinary inspired" and sell items with shorter ingredient lists and fresher ingredients.
"Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?" Andres asked rhetorically. "We probably don't."
He said McDonald's is defending its food from "absurd questions" and that despite its critics, the brand's image is improving among key consumers such as millennials and moms.
"The brand is fine," Andres said.
Outside findings suggests the company has much work to do.
Research firm dunnhumbyUSA on Wednesday said McDonald's came in 10th place in its fast-food Customer Centricity Index, which it said tracks customer perceptions of how well restaurants meet their needs and wants. In-N-Out Burger, Chick-fil-A and Culver's took the top three spots.
On Thursday, rival Yum Brands, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, holds its own analyst and investor meeting in New York. Late Tuesday, Yum cut its profit forecast for the year, and its shares fell 6.3 percent on Wednesday. McDonald's shares declined 1.5 percent.
Activist hedge fund Jana Partners, which disclosed a stake of more than 842,000 shares in McDonald's in November, declined to comment on Wednesday's presentation.
McDonald's said Monday that it was trying to bring its "create your taste" ordering system to about 2,000 of its U.S. restaurants by the end of next year, or roughly 1 in 7 locations. Thompson stressed on Wednesday that "create your taste," which has already rolled out across Australia, is no longer a test effort. "This is a rolling implementation now," he said.
McDonald's worldwide same-restaurant sales declined 2.2 percent in November, the company reported Monday. The drop was steeper than Wall Street anticipated and marked its sixth consecutive monthly decline. The biggest drop came in the United States, where same-restaurant sales fell 4.6 percent, the steepest U.S. drop since June 2001. McDonald's U.S. same-store sales have not increased since October 2013.

Russian  Indian funds to invest $1 bn in infrastructureIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
Looking to deepen economic and trade ties, India and Russia today agreed to jointly explore for oil and gas, build petrochem plants, lay pipelines and cooperate in infrastructure development and smart cities to treble bilateral trade to USD 30 billion by 2025.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi envisage broader collaboration between hydrocarbon companies in oil and gas exploration and production as well as in LNG projects and supplies.
“It is expected that Indian companies will strongly participate in projects related to new oil and gas fields in the territory of the Russian Federation. The sides will study the possibilities of building a hydrocarbon pipeline system, connecting the Russian Federation with India.
“They will also examine avenues for participation in petrochemical projects in each other’s country and in third countries,” a joint statement said.

The leaders have encouraged Indian and Russian companies to pursue greater participation in each other’s power generation projects, as also in supply of equipment, technology for enhanced oil recoveries and extraction of coal, including coking coal.
Recognising the enormous untapped potential in bilateral trade, investment and economic cooperation, the two leaders encouraged businesses to explore opportunities arising from increasing national focus on infrastructure development and expanding the manufacturing sector.
It is expected that Russian companies will utilize the opportunities in a wide range of Indian sectors and will ‘Make in India’, it said.
The two sides agreed to step up efforts for enhancing bilateral trade in goods and services and set a target of USD 30 billion by 2025, it said adding “it is expected that the level of mutual investments by then will be over USD 15 billion each way.”
It also said that an emphasis will be laid on promoting Russian investments in India in major infrastructure projects like DMIC, smart cities and freight corridors, telecom, power and roads.
“In Russia, Indian participation in Industrial Parks and technology platforms, in sectors like pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, coal and energy will be encouraged,” it said, adding that the two sides would encourage specialized investment funds to invest in these sectors and in the joint manufacturing of high technology products.
“In this context, they welcome the initiative of a direct investment fund of USD 2 billion between Rosnano and suitable Indian investment partners for implementation of high-tech projects. They will protect the legitimate interests of investing companies,” it added.
In particular, it said, both the sides will enter into discussions to renegotiate the existing bilateral agreement for protection and promotion of investments, initially agreed on 23 December 1994, to provide for the protection of foreign investments in each others’ territory.
The two leaders will encourage payments in national currencies for bilateral trade.
“The Working Group established for this purpose will make recommendations on eliminating the existing barriers and stimulating transactions in national currencies,” the joint statement said.
The leaders agreed that the initiative launched by India and the Eurasian Economic Commission for a Joint Study Group (JSG) to explore the feasibility of a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement covering trade in goods, services, investment cooperation, movement of natural persons and mutual recognition of standards, is of great importance for bilateral economic cooperation.
“The Russian side will support the productive work of the JSG so that this Group completes its study within an optimal timeframe,” it said adding “the leaders noted that the International North-South Transport Corridor can vastly improve the efficiency of bilateral trade by significantly reducing transit time and freight costs”.
India and Russia would work together to conclude the necessary multilateral arrangements and outreach to step up the use of this corridor at the earliest.
The leaders also noted that the governments of the two countries and their industry representatives should join hands to disseminate information about business opportunities in each other’s countries.
“The sides also agreed on mutual trade facilitation measures, particularly with regards to simplified customs procedures. In this context, they agreed to finalize shortly a protocol on a “Green Corridor project,” it said.
Both the leaders invited companies to realize the substantial opportunities in engineering, pharmaceuticals, information and communication technology, chemicals, fertilizers, metallurgy, agro and animal products and transport.
Further they agreed to encourage linkages between other regions and cities of the two countries with a view to enhance trade and investment, tourism, cultural and people-to-people contacts.
“The leaders expressed confidence that a web of linkages between these and other regions and cities will bring substantial benefits to these regions and cities and bolster India-Russia partnership further,” it added.
Noting the synergies between national efforts to develop a knowledge-economy powered by technology and innovation, India and Russia will increase collaboration in joint design, development, manufacturing and marketing of technology-driven products and scientific interaction between the countries.
HIGHLIGHTS
(Reuters) Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin got straight down to talks on Thursday on boosting nuclear and defence cooperation at a summit aimed at reviving an old friendship that has faded over the years.
Putin’s one-day visit to India, at which a raft of agreements were signed, comes at a time when Russia is at odds with the West over Ukraine, and its economy is stalling as oil prices tumble to their lowest in five years.
Here are some of the key announcements:
ENERGY
* Russia’s state-owned Rosatom will supply 12 nuclear energy reactors to India over 20 years, under an agreement aimed at boosting nuclear energy ties between the two countries.
* India’s Essar Group signed a deal with Russian oil producer Rosneft to import oil.

Russian, Indian funds to invest $1 billion in infrastructure
(Reuters) The Russian Direct Investment Fund will team up with an Indian partner to invest $1 billion in infrastructure and hydroelectric projects in Asia’s third-largest economy, the head of the Russian state fund told Reuters on Wednesday.
The RDIF and India’s IDFC, a leading infrastructure investor, will each commit $500 million to projects under a deal to be signed on Thursday during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to overcome India’s chronic power shortages, and the country has vast untapped hydroelectric potential in its northern Himalayan belt.
RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev told Reuters the investments would back projects involving a large Russian hydro-power company but he declined to name the company.
The only large Russian player in this area is state-controlled Rushydro. Rushydro’s spokeswoman Yelena Vishnyakova could not immediately be reached by for comment.
IDFC, which is 16 percent state owned, confirmed it would sign a partnership with RDIF but declined to comment on the details.
The Russian fund was set up in 2011 with $10 billion in state funds. It can back investments as long as its partners match it at least dollar for dollar. Dmitriev said he expected to commit funds to the Indian projects next year.
The RDIF has so far invested $1.3 billion of its own money along with $6 billion by outside investors, mainly sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Asia.
Dmitriev said the RDIF had managed to turn profits on investments in a Russian telecoms company and the Moscow stock exchange despite Western sanctions, a slowing economy and sliding oil prices.

ECB stimulus seen as too small  more expectedEuropean Central Bank stimulus seen as too small, more expected

European Central Bank
(The European Central Bank…)
FRANKFURT: The European Central Bank has handed out 130 billion euros ($162 billion) in cheap, long-term loans to banks _ part of its effort to stimulate the struggling eurozone economy.
Analysts said the amount was too small and made it more likely the ECB will soon have to take more drastic steps such as large-scale bond purchases.
The figure for Tuesday's loan offering was closely watched in the markets because ECB president Mario Draghi has said the bank will add roughly 1 trillion euros in new stimulus in coming months.
Banks took money for four years at the very low interest rate of 0.15 percent. The ECB hopes the banks will lend the money on to companies so they can expand, hire people and get the economy going again.
Analysts said the amount banks wanted was too low to help achieve the 1 trillion-goal _ and makes it more likely that the ECB will have to resort to new stimulus programs to reach it. That could include using newly created money to make large-scale purchases of government bonds.
The U.S. Federal Reserve made such large-scale bond purchases, which were credited with reducing unemployment and boosting the recovery. Some economists and ECB officials have questioned whether they would have the same effect in the eurozone. Draghi has promised additional measures if the economy doesn't improve, but appears to face resistance from some members of the bank's governing council.
``The ECB will have to employ additional tools to reach its intended balance sheet size,'' economist Christian Schulz at Berenberg Bank wrote in a note to investors.
Top ECB official Benoit Coeure said the central bank's credit offers, including an 82.6 billion-euro round of loans in September, ``create conditions that stimulate credit growth to the real economy.''
The economy of the 18 countries that use the euro grew only 0.2 percent in the third quarter from the previous three-month period. Inflation remains alarmingly weak at 0.3 percent, and unemployment is high at 11.5 percent.

The First  Natural  Fast Food Burger Comes From Where!reddit
Carl's Jr. will introduce what it says is the first "all-natural, no hormones, no antibiotics, no steroids, grass-fed, free-range beef patty" from any major quick-service chain. The item also is the latest effort by a QSR chain to reach out to the 18-to-34-year-old millennial age group, some of whom are choosing fast-casual chains such as Smashburger, Elevation Burger and The Counter, perceiving these chains' food to be higher quality.
The All-Natural Burger, available Dec. 17, tops the char-broiled beef patty with Cheddar cheese, "vine ripened" tomato, red onion, lettuce, bread-and butter pickles, ketchup, mustard and mayo on a baked-in-house bun. The new burger is priced a la carte at $4.69, or $6.99 for a double. Carl's Jr. says customers will be able to request the Natural patty on any burger on the menu for an additional charge.
"We've seen a growing demand for 'cleaner,' more natural food, particularly among millennials, and we're proud to be the first major fast-food chain to offer an all-natural beef patty burger on our menu. Millennials include our target of 'Young Hungry Guys' and they are much more concerned about what goes into their bodies than previous generations," Brad Haley, chief marketing officer for Carl's Jr., said in a statement announcing the new burger. "Whether you're into more natural foods or not, it's simply a damn good burger."
McDonald's this week announced plans to expand availability of its "Create Your Taste" customization option for Quarter Pounders. That program also is seen as a way to appeal to millennials. But as reported here earlier, NPD Group data shows that millennials' visits to QSRs have declined over the past five years but 25-to-34-year-olds still make 171 annual QSR visits, compared with 11 fast-casual visits.
Broadcast advertising from agency 72andSunny breaks Dec. 29. The chain says it will air an additional spot during the Feb. 1, 2015, Super Bowl.

Maharashtra govt will not compromise consumer interest in milk pricing: CMFadnavisBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 11, 2014 8:39 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 8:41 pm
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday assured he would convene a meeting with the Opposition leaders to tackle the problems faced by milk producers who have been adversely hit because of surplus supply of milk and decline in prices. Fadnavis made it clear that interests of both consumers and farmers who are engaged in the milk production would be safeguarded.
Earlier, Revenue Minister and Minister for Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development Eknath Khadse said, “The government will guard the consumers interest and not private players who seek higher milk prices at the cost of consumers.” Khadse said, “The government’s concern is to protect the interest of the consumers who benefit with drop in milk prices. And argued that private players who own the dairy don’t pass the benefit to the farmers.”
The senior NCP leaders Ajit Pawar, Dilip Walse Patil, Jaidutt Kshirsagar raised concerns over the sharp decline in the milk prices from Rs 27 per litre to Rs 17 per litre. The NCP leaders argued, ” The drop in milk prices have adversely hit the farmers.” Both Pawar and Patil argued, “We are seeking fair remuneration for farmers. As milk is perishable product and cannot last beyond a day.” However, Khadse argued, “The private dairy companies are getting supply from other states to show higher supply and seek more prices.”
But Khadse said, “Government wants to promote milk cooperatives. And would not allow private vested interests to influence government.”

Gujarat HC rejects AAP plea to issue notice to PM Narendra Modi in affidavitcaseBy: Press Trust of India | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 11, 2014 8:35 pm
Upholding the order of a trial court, the Gujarat High Court rejected an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) member’s plea seeking issuance of notice to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in connection with his affidavit filed before the 2012 Gujarat state assembly election.
Justice J B Pardiwala turned down AAP member Nishant Verma’s application saying that issuance of notice is the jurisdiction of the sessions court.
Verma had challenged a sessions court order and demanded issuance of notices to Modi and returning officer P K Jadeja of the Maninagar assembly seat in 2012.
“I do not find any good reason to interfere with the order passed by the revisional court (sessions court). I am sure that while disposing of the criminal revision application (of Verma before the session court), the learned judge would keep in mind the provisions of Section 401 (2) of the code,” Justice JB Pardiwala said in his order.
“In the result, this petition fails and is hereby rejected. I clarify that I have otherwise not gone into the merit of the matter. The revision application shall be decided on its own merit without being influenced in any manner by any of the observations made by this court in this order,” the order said.
In his main plea, which is pending before the sessions court, Verma had sought legal action against Modi and Jadeja in the 2012 affidavit case.
Later, he demanded summoning of both Modi and Jadeja before the court, which was rejected on October 10 by Additional Sessions Judge G N Rana, after which he approached the Gujarat High Court.

Trestor to bring Bitcoin-like digital currency inIndiaWritten by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 8:25 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 8:35 pm
Trestor Foundation , a non-profit private organisation, is looking forward to enter the digital currency market in India. It enables digital money along with a complete new payment and market system. Trestor aims to help under-developed and developing countries uplift their economies.
The Trestor Network or T-Net, is a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen.
From a consumer perspective, T- Net is a computer program or mobile app that provides a personal digital wallet that allows a user to send and receive Trests with them. “Using Trests is as simple as using email or WhatsApp. Beyond this, the users are benefited with facilities such as; faster and cost efficient to transfer, Trests can be transferred at minimum (close to zero) fees. They can be easily sent to anyone, anywhere in the world without paying up to 55 – 60 % transaction fees,” said Kunal Dixit, Founder, Trestor Foundation .
Like Bitcoin:
T-Net is an open source, peer-to-peer network
T-Net transactions are irreversible, sent over the Internet, and counterfeit proof
T-Net uses an advanced form of the same underlying cryptography as Bitcoin
T-Net nodes can be run by anyone
Unlike Bitcoin:
T-Net transactions are fully confirmed in seconds (Bitcoin takes ~ 10 mins)
T-Net allows usernames for accounts (Bitcoin has long 26-35 digit alphanumeric addresses, these are impossible to memorize)
T-Net solves the double spending problem with consensus instead of proof-of-work (which is used by Bitcoin)
Consensus is the process by which the entire network agrees on the same Ledger. It is what keeps everybody on the same page.
Valuation:
“Trests are short for Trestor Donation Receipts (TDRs). Instead of issuing paper receipts to our donors, we issue electronic receipts aka ‘Trests’.  On the date of launch, January 5, 2015, the price of 1 Trest would be equivalent to 1 US cent. That is, you can buy about 160 Trests with a 100 Rupee note. The price would then change depending upon relative demand and supply,” said Dixit.
Trest have properties resulting from the system’s design that allows them to be subjectively valued by individuals. This valuation is demonstrated when individuals freely exchange Trests over the exchanges. Trestor Foundation has a mandate to keep the market for Trests deep and liquid, this helps in price stability. Trestor Foundation is the buyer of last resort in case of a market selloff; it is a seller if the market gets too heated, added Dixit.
Is it a digital bank?
“Trestor is neither a ‘brick and mortar’ nor a ‘digital’ bank because we are not a deposit taking institution. If a donor donates money to Trestor, she will receive ‘Trests’ i.e. our donation receipts; In exchange, the ownership of the donated capital shifts from her to Trestor Foundation. Her ‘Trests’ carry a certain market value, she can choose to either keep them or exchange them for Rupees over any of the major cryptocurrency exchanges,” said Dixit.
Revenue model:
“As a non-profit our priorities are towards fulfilling our mission ie. to create the most efficient Money, Payment and Market system for the world. Therefore there are no transaction fees for making any transaction over T-Net. We would be launching many other exciting products in 1st quarter of 2015, all of those would be free to use, we would not be charging for any other additional services / product development. Just like Wikipedia and Mozilla Foundation, a part of our donation capital would help us take care of our operating expenses and rest would be utilized to further our mission,” said Dixit.
T-Net goes live on January 5, 2015. Users can download the app on their smartphone or computer.

Wall Street bounces on retail sales boostWall St. lower but finishes year with solid gains
Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York

Financial Markets
U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as crude oil prices continued their descent, but the S&P closed out a third straight year of double-digit gains.
For the year, the Dow ended up 7.5 percent, notching its sixth straight annual gain, and the Nasdaq rose 13.4 percent. The best-performing S&P component in 2014 was Southwest Airlines Co  up 124.6 percent, while Transocean Ltd , down 62.9 percent, was the worst.

Equities lost steam heading into the New Year after rallying nearly 6 percent over eight sessions, sparked by the U.S. Federal Reserve's commitment to be "patient" about raising interest rates and positive economic data.
Still, the S&P 500 has risen in seven of the past ten sessions, hitting a series of intraday and closing records, and finished the year up 11.4 percent. The stock market will be closed Thursday.
"The fact of the matter is markets put in a solid year in spite of significant headwinds that could have easily derailed a multi-year bull market," said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.

"The most the bears got out of this year was a 10 percent correction on an intraday basis and the markets stubbornly moved higher, and for good foundational reasons."
Gains may be tougher to come by next year, and a pick-up in profits growth may be essential if the market is to continue to add to its historic gains.
Action in the energy space was once again a focus for investors. U.S. crude oil  settled down 85 cents at $53.27 a barrel, its lowest since May 2009. Brent  settled down 57 cents to $57.33.
The S&P Energy index <.SPNY>, easily the worst performing sector of the year with a decline of 10 percent, lost 0.8 percent Wednesday. Diamond Offshore  fell 3.6 percent to $36.71 and Noble Corp  fell 2.8 percent to $16.57.
The CBOE volatility index <.VIX>, which measures the cost of protection against a drop on the S&P 500, surged 20.4 percent, its biggest jump since Dec. 10 and the fourth straight climb. Quarterly options on the S&P 500 expire at the end of the month.
"Part of it may be the quarterly expiration of S&P options but a lot of it has to do with crude being down today," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at retail brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.
Traders might be also looking to load up on some protection before they head out for the holiday, Kinahan said.
"We had such a nice year that many people may be looking to buy some protection for a 'just-in-case scenario' for between now and the new year," Kinahan said.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 160 points, or 0.89 percent, to 17,823.07, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 21.45 points, or 1.03 percent, to 2,058.9 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 41.39 points, or 0.87 percent, to 4,736.05.
Volume was light, with about 5.21 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.95 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.
Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE 2,000 to 1,105, for a 1.81-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,571 issues fell and 1,194 advanced for a 1.32-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 35 new lows.

Foxconn mgt  unions to meet to discuss plans on suspension of operationsFoxconn mgt, unions to meet to discuss plans on suspension of operations
BS Reporter | Chennai Dec 11, 2014 08:30 PM IST
A meeting between the management of electronics manufacturer Foxconn and the employees'' organisations at its facility in Sriperumbudur is to take place at the Assistant Commissioner of Labour's (ACL) office in Sriperumbudur, almost 40 kilometers away from Chennai, to discuss on the future of employees and other issues. The development comes after the company  informed workers that is planning to suspend operations from December 24, 2014.
According to union sources, the company has informed the workers that it does not have enough work to operate the facility, which is close to the beleaguered Nokia India manufacturing facility, and is planning to suspend operations. Two meetings with the CITU-baced employees union, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)-backed Anna Thozhil Sanga Peravai and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-backed Labour Progressive Front (LPF) has been held in the presence of the ACL, without any major results.
"They have told us that the production is down and it is not sustainable for them. But it is still exporting components to other facilities manufacturing Nokia handsets and also have other jobs. The management is meeting the unions in the ACL's office to come to a conclusion on the issue," said a union leader from LPF.
It may be noted that the facility has been in trouble from the tax issues started at Nokia India, which finally suspended operations in its only Indian facility from November 1, this year, following Microsoft terminated the transitional services agreement (TSA) with this facility.

USA TODAY College 2014 holiday gift guide: DIYSEND
EMAIL
When it comes to the holidays, college students often find themselves with just a few final dollars left in their bank accounts. Which makes DIY gifts a great way of saying, “I’m broke, but I still care.”
Here are five simple, yet meaningful homemade gifts you can make in five minutes or less, for $5 or less. If – despite your best efforts – your gift doesn’t turn out perfectly, don’t worry. Just remember: It’s the thought that counts.
Share your own DIY projects with YourTake !
1. DIY picture frames Unfinished wood picture frames can be found at any craft store for around $1, depending on the size you choose. Pick up a few and decorate them to your liking. To make the gift even more personal, include a picture of you and the intended recipient in the frame. They’ll be sure to love the thought put into this gift.
2. Make your own ornaments
We know, this is an elementary school mainstay. But if a bunch of 8-year-old kids can do it, so can you. Pick out a basic ornament, coat it  in glue and roll it in glitter. Or, pour a little acrylic paint and a drop of water inside and swirl it around. You can even simply fill it halfway with white glitter and tell the recipient it’s a melted snowman. Because, to borrow a line from Frozen’s Olaf, “Some people are worth melting for.”

PepsiCo Chicago cutting at least 100 Chicago jobsPepsiCo cutting jobs in Chicago

PepsiCo nutrition division slimming down under new leader, cutting at least 100 jobs.
PepsiCo has started cutting jobs in Chicago, the latest step in a long-running effort to trim costs as demand softens for some of its soft drinks and snacks.
The eliminated positions come from a variety of levels and appear to account for a sizable portion of PepsiCo's Chicago office, the site of the company's North America Nutrition division that oversees brands such as Gatorade, Quaker and Tropicana.
Affected employees were contacted Wednesday, according to people familiar with the situation.
PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., declined to confirm how many jobs were cut and called the number of Chicago-based employees "minimal."
PepsiCo has been called out by activist investor Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management disclosed a stake in the No. 2 soft-drink maker in April 2013. Trian pushed PepsiCo to consider focusing its operations either by buying snack-maker Mondelez International or splitting its own snack and beverage businesses into two public companies.
Instead, PepsiCo's board, led by Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi, in February announced that it was keeping beverages and food together as one company after an "exhaustive review."

PepsiCo also added five years to its ongoing productivity plan, taking the three-year plan set to end in 2014 through 2019. The company has said that its plan to cut $8 billion in costs over eight years includes simplifying its organization.
In a March letter to PepsiCo's board, Trian's suggestions included PepsiCo close facilities in Chicago and Purchase to reduce corporate costs.
"We are committed to handling affected individuals with care and offering transition assistance to all impacted employees," the company said Thursday, adding that it "remains committed to having a strong presence in Chicago."
"We are transforming how we operate through a more integrated structure across the PepsiCo businesses based in Chicago, which will fuel our success moving forward," the company said.
The job cuts are the latest shake up for PepsiCo's Chicago office, 555 W. Monroe St.
In September, PepsiCo named Oswald Barckhahn president of PepsiCo North America Nutrition, a promotion after his time as senior vice president of Tropicana North America. Barckhahn replaced Debra Crew, who left PepsiCo and in October became president and chief commercial officer of tobacco company R.J. Reynolds.
PepsiCo, the maker of Pepsi soft drinks, Frito-Lay chips and Tropicana juices, has also dealt with high-profile executive departures this year.
Brian Cornell in summer left his post as CEO of PepsiCo Americas Foods to become chairman and CEO of Target. And in November, PepsiCo said president Zein Abdalla was leaving at the end of the year.
Barckhahn now oversees PepsiCo's nutrition businesses in the United States and Canada, which along with Tropicana includes Quaker, Gatorade and Naked Emerging Brands. Barckhahn has been with PepsiCo for more than a decade, but has spent most of that time outside of Chicago.
PepsiCo has been investing in and expanding its lineup of nutritious products under Nooyi, CEO since 2006. Such products accounted for about 20 percent of the company's total revenue last year.
Still, while trying to grow its businesses, PepsiCo also has been cutting costs.
In 2012, PepsiCo announced plans to cut up to 8,700 jobs, or 3 percent of its global workforce, over three years. That included plans to cut about 150 Chicago-based employees. It is unclear how many jobs were cut as part of that plan.
As of December 2013, PepsiCo employed about 274,000 people, including about 106,000 in the United States. The number of U.S. employees at the end of 2013 was in line with a year earlier.
PepsiCo acquired Chicago-based Quaker Oats in 2001, a move that added Gatorade and Quaker brands to its lineup. Quaker moved its headquarters from 321 N. Clark St. to a new building at 555 W. Monroe St. in 2002, a move that was planned before PepsiCo bought Quaker. Chicago persuaded Quaker to keep its headquarters in the city with nearly $10 million in city assistance in 2000.
PepsiCo bought Naked Juice, a maker of high-end juices, in 2007.
In October, Barckhahn internally announced his leadership team, which largely works with him out of the Chicago office.
"Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade and Naked Emerging Brands are terrific businesses in their own right, but reaching their full potential requires us to recognize that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts," Barckhahn wrote in October, according to a copy of a memo obtained by the Tribune. "These businesses are truly better together, and we must manage them as such."

Dow spikes 200 points after 3-day selloffThursday, 11 Dec 2014 |  4:14  PM ET

CB Exchange: Big rally fades
Oil broke $60 today, and that caused traders to start to sell. The market was up over 200 points and those gains have dropped significantly. With Jim Lowell, Adviser Investments; Phil Blancato, Ladenburg Thalmann; Heather Hughes, SunAmerica Funds; and Erik Ristuben, Russell Investments.
U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday, cutting weekly losses, but euphoria over increased retail sales in November faded as oil fell to another five-year low and renewed worries of a government shutdown.
Stocks finished far off session highs, with Wall Street starting to dial back gains after crude dropped below $60 a barrel, and the pullback escalated amid efforts to block a spending bill in the House , sparking worries of the government closing.
"It's a combination of oil dipping below key support levels and trepidation over Washington's inability to get something accomplished," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.
Stocks had rallied, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging as much as 225 points, after figures from the Commerce Department had retail sales rising 0.7 percent last month, the largest increase in eight months.
"The consumer is absolutely feeling better. Their homes are worth more, their 401ks are worth more, and they are paying less at the gas pump; holiday spending is doing much better than I would have guessed six months ago,"  said Patty Edwards, managing director for investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
"We've been expecting lower gas prices were going to help the consumer, and that is obviously bearing out. On the electronics side, people are buying gadgets. The other thing I've been saying is that people are staying in their homes, and spending at big-box home-improvement retailers," Edwards added.
"Retail sales are driving things, they were very strong," said Chris Gaffney, senior market strategist at EverBank Wealth Management.
"This movement today to me crystallizes that investors are starting to believe that the equity market can stand on its own, that it's not necessarily dependent on the Fed," Gaffney added of the Federal Reserve, and concerns about what would occur once the U.S. central bank begins raising benchmark interest rates.
After the stronger-than-expected retail report, the National Retail Federation told CNBC its forecast "is right on track" for a 4.1 percent sales growth this holiday season.
"The lower oil prices are good for the global economy. It's not good for the energy sector, down nearly 15 percent year to date, and that is a drag on the broader market, but lower gas prices are good for the consumer. A second thing it does is keep inflation expectations lower, which gives the Fed more room to keep rates lower for longer," said Gaffney.
Separately, the Labor Department reported fewer Americans filed unemployment claims last week.

Rajya Sabha today witnessed uproarious scenes with members from Congress lodging strong protest against eulogising of Nathuram Godse by Bharatiya Janata Party MP at a function held in Maharashtra earlier this month.
‘Nathuram Godse a patriot just like Mahatma Gandhi,’ says BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj during a programme in Maharashtra according to NDTV report.
Under attack from the opposition members, Government disapproved of any such event hailing Mahatma Gandhi’s killer but said no organisation should be defamed.
The Upper House saw two brief adjournments over the issue as Congress members protested holding placards in the aisles and raising slogans, while charging right-wing organisations with lending their support to it.
Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Husain Dalwai (Cong) said he has written to Maharashtra Chief Minister over hosting the event attended by some religious leaders and former MLAs.
“Mahatma Gandhi’s killer is being eulogised by hosting his ‘Shaurya Diwas’ in Maharashtra…These people talk of development, but are trying to create a rift in society,” he said, accusing the right-wing organisations of indulging in such things, including religious conversions that created tension in society.
Congress members created uproar over the issue and raised slogans while displaying placards of the event, even as Deputy Chairman P J Kurien tried to pacify the agitating members, asking them to take their seats and maintain peace.
“Don’t make use of Zero Hour for this kind of display. This is gross indiscipline…To decide the culpability or otherwise, the courts are there, not me or you,” Kurien said.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, “This is not acceptable. Mahatma Gandhi’s killer, whosoever it may be, we are against it…We do not accept any honour of Mahatma Gandhi’s killers.”
As members continued their protest and the House witnessed acrimonious exchanges between both sides, Kurien adjourned the proceedings for 10 minutes just before noon.
But, similar scenes were witnessed when the House met at noon, forcing the Chair to adjourn it again for 15 minutes.
When the House reassembled, Anand Sharma (Cong) said, “It is not acceptable that some one eulogises him. I hope neither the House nor the Parliamentary Affairs Minister will approve of such an action. Let the House speak in one voice and condemn it.”
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said, “There is no question of eulogising such a person. We should leave the matter there, but defaming an organisation is not acceptable.”
It was after this that normal proceedings resumed.

When marketers turn mind-readersTweet

A peep into India’s first neuro lab and what it could mean for the future of marketing
If you ever wanted that magical gift of reading your wife or girlfriend’s mind, your prayers have come close to being answered. A couple of weeks back, Mumbai saw the launch of the first neuro laboratory for delving deeper into the minds of Indian consumers. The spoiler for eager husbands and excited boyfriends: as of now, this facility is available only for marketers.
The motive of this laboratory is to make marketing materials more effective. The kind of work that the facility is expected to do ranges from testing advertising commercials in both print and television, testing the consumer response to packaging, product design or brand research. The only difference with this research and traditional methods is that there will be no questions asked.
Green frog, blue frog
As we enter the facility set up by information and consumer insights major Nielsen, we find two assistants applying gel in no small measure to a young man’s hair. The young man is one of the subjects — as market researchers call their respondents — who is being prepared to get his mind read at the neuro laboratory.
The person who will read his mind is no mentalist from Israel or mystic from God’s own country. In fact, it’s an EEG machine – otherwise used by medical professionals — that will, over the next 20 minutes, analyse his brain’s reaction to marketing materials. And for the machine to capture the precise reactions, it has to get as close to his scalp as possible, hence the gel.
Take a few more steps ahead and you find another completely wired up lady subject looking like she’s been held hostage inside a cabin. No one is allowed entry into the cabin. Any communication with her is possible only through a microphone from a cubicle right outside the cabin. The lady in question is looking into a screen mounted on a wall in front of her, blissfully unaware of a crowd of 20 people staring at her from outside the glass cabin. Outside, a computer captures her attention, emotion and memory traces on a second-by-second basis and even her eye movements.
Images of a green frog are being flashed on the screen, interspersed by one image of a blue frog. Outside on the screen, when the green frog flashes, you get a small bump in the brainwaves captured by the EEG.
When the blue frog flashes, there is a more prominent, greater bump. “You get a reaction from the brain when you spot something interesting or different. Get a reaction that brain picked that up,” explains Joe Willke, president, Nielsen NeuroFocus, who was in India for the launch.
The blue frog, green frog story, goes on for about five minutes. When the subject begins to close her eyes, she’s woken up by a voice from the microphone saying, “wake up and pay attention”. There is a reason why every subject needs to be alert. Even an eye-blink can create a lot of noise in the data being captured by the machines.
The blue frog-green frog exercise is core to the research that Nielsen NeuroFocus undertakes. There is a response in every brain that happens around 300 milliseconds after you see something. “It’s kind of a recognition that I see that and I have got it,” adds Willke.
As every human’s brain is different, this ‘blue frog’ exercise helps researchers to normalise the data, as the findings of the logo and messages that are evaluated later in the research are indexed back to blue green frog data for each subject.
As of now, in most parts of the world, neuro-marketing research is still at an early part of the adoption curve. It’s only recently that many large corporations, both in India and abroad, are beginning to say, “I have kicked the tyres on this car enough. It’s time to start driving,” says Willke. He says this emerging confidence will make the practice mainstream in the days to come.
According to him, “Most notions of branding change dramatically after adopting neuro. I always read that you need to mention the brand in the first five seconds of the commercial. The more times you mention the brand, the better. There are all kinds of recipes. It’s so much more complicated than that. What we are finding in this is, brands are a collection of associations.”
The dog tale
India, according to Nielsen executives, is one of the early adopters. For example, in the last year, if the number of subjects used was 30,000, India was 10 per cent of the market. The largest market in US and India may be number two, he adds.
The laboratory proposes to include the usual questions such as “what do consumers think of my brand”. But the answer will come in a different fashion. Earlier, using conventional research, consumers would “tell” what they thought about the brand. “With neuro-marketing, it’s not what they tell me but what they really think about the brand,” says Willke.
Other questions that the lab will apply include this: “did your brand get the boost or did you inadvertently boost the entire category?”
For example, if your analgesic brand claims that it is safe, fast and effective and advertises those benefits, is that your unique attribute? Aren’t all analgesics safe, fast and effective? Or does the analgesic in question own the safe, fast and effective attributes more than the competition?
For example, in automobiles, Volvo owns the safety attribute more than most competitors. So would any competitor advertising safety be indirectly bringing Volvo into the consumer’s mind?
“Marketers always want to believe that when viewers are watching television, they are completely into it. But the truth is, they are not. They are playing with phones, talking to family members. In a low engagement environment a viewer can very easily mistake a commercial for another brand,” says Willke.
The neuro-marketing lab test is set up to be a pure measure of the creative. It measures the brain’s reaction to any creative communication of the brand on a second-to-second basis. It then aligns that reaction with the scenes of a TV commercial. “This helps you to do the diagnosis of the commercial,” says Willke.
In the case of a social advertising commercial to promote the adoption of pets, the protagonist of the commercial, a lovable dog, was getting good reviews.
But there was no significant jump in adoption. When this ad was tested in a Neuro laboratory, particularly in the closing scenes of the commercial where the dog appears alongside the adoption message, the lab found that all eyes were falling on the dog and too little attention was going to the adopt message.
When the dog was removed from the final scenes, the adoption rates increased significantly as the central focus of the closing message was on adoption of pets minus any distraction.
Talk about brand ambassadors sometimes overpowering the brand message. Some EEG out there is soon going to press the red signal to such creatives.

May their tribe growAddendum is a weekly column that takes a sometimes hard, sometimes casual, sometimes irreverent, yet never malicious look at some of the new or recent advertisements and comments on them.
May their tribe grow
The Parsis are a unique community. Everyone knows how they reached the shores of Gujarat fleeing religious persecution, charmed the Jadhav Rana by promising to blend in like sugar dissolves in milk, not altering its colour or consistency in any way, just sweetening it forever. Much has been written about their immense contribution to the economic status of India, the social fabric of Mumbai, their charming little eccentricities, their orientation towards philanthropy and their general goodness. I have witnessed many of the attributes of Parsis in the shape of a very dear friend whom I have known closely for over four decades. And yet, as a community, their numbers have been dwindling alarmingly. This is obviously because of an amalgam of many reasons but the thought that this community is hurtling toward possible extinction in the pure form we know is alarming. And any effort to improve their numbers is very welcome. One such effort is by the Ministry of Minority Affairs and Parzon (Unesco) in the shape of a print advertising campaign aimed at this little community that is scattered across the country and concentrated in Mumbai.
Created by Madison BNB the campaign uses a combination of the self-deprecatory humour that Parsis are so known for, to urge them to get married and have more children. In fact, the ad mentions that if a married Parsi couple is childless, it could be entitled to financial assistance to explore the possibility of an IVF procedure. The headline of one of the ads reads “Panni ja isn’t a spell from Harry Potter. It means get married”. The tone of the advertising is casual and to-the-point. Apart from the advertising being something that could be effective we are pleasantly surprised to see this noteworthy effort from the Ministry of Minority Affairs. And happily, though the creatives are the work of Raj Nair, the owner of Madison BNB is a good Parsi, Sam Balsara. May their tribe grow! I hope Parsis all over the world read this interesting advertising, or are told of it by their friends.
As for me, I am happy to report that my own dear Parsi friend has done his bit for the community as evidenced by his two lovely daughters.
Let’s unfake it
As you are aware, everyone is trying to use bad English to create “cool” words. So now you have Diageo telling you to “unfake” it. The TV commercial (TVC) is made by McCann Erickson and begins with two girls taking a selfie and saying something about being ready to rock the party in a completely fake accent. Let’s skip to the part where a Smirnoff logo catches your eye on a record the DJ is spinning and you wonder what the current definition of surrogate advertising is all about. So cocktail stirrers are out and party experiences are in. Doesn’t really make a difference. Someone is still making a mockery of the law of the land giving their own spin to the ostensible reason for the advertising. My take: Let’s unfake the advertising. And move on with what’s correct in life. Oh by the way, ASCI, are you listening?
Bag and the Bhat
It’s funny. In Taipei the other day we were talking about the good old days when companies like VIP Industries were really big advertisers and I come back and see a new advertisement from the group. This time, not for luggage but for designer handbags. The entire film is lovingly shot on location somewhere in Europe and just shows the new sensation Alia Bhat walking around in different dresses, carrying different handbags from the Caprese collection. Made by Company, the film has a very pleasing look about it and the use of the celebrity serves its purpose to increase awareness in the right way about the brand. At the end of the film, Alia says “I’m a Caprese girl”, and that’s about the entire “dialogue” in the film. The problem is in deciding whether you can take your eyes off the fetching Alia to take in the details of the handbags.

Not too long in the future, the consumer will buy a car or pay bills using wearable devices
In the first part of this article, the author spoke about how the next big thing in mobility devices to change the dynamics of the banking sector would be Google Glass (GG). He illustrated how GG could be used effectively in retail banking. Here, in the second and concluding part of the article, are more instances demonstrating the use of GG.
Take the case of Dan, a consumer who is eco-friendly and consciously avoids, in every possible way, abusing the environment. He has been looking to buy a car and as luck would have it, a top automobile company has just launched the most advanced ‘green’ car. Visiting the showroom, Dan decides to buy the most recent edition of a premium car. His bank locates his presence, makes a car loan offer. Dan has a quick conversation with the bank manager on his GG, scans the required documents and transmits through it; the loan is approved.
Dan authenticates the transaction using the one time password (OTP) while logged into audio/video chat. He finally instructs the bank to transfer the money to the car dealer for the purchase. He does this entire transaction sitting in the automobile showroom and drives the new car home.
Winnie is a student of architecture. Classic architecture designs fascinate her. She loves the high columns and arches. Winnie loves her bank for one reason — an app that affords a virtual branch experience, complete with Greco-Roman architecture. Winnie’s bank uses the native video feature in the GG for this.
Kathy is very active on social media and is present on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and what have you. She has over 2,000 friends online. She is very quick in acknowledging ‘likes’ and posting her experiences. Her life revolves around social media. Kathy went to her bank about a problem with her bank account. The bank manager did not pay much attention to her. She left the bank with this bad experience and as always, got onto social media. It is so easy now with her new GG. The news is out in minutes.
Locating an ATM
Sam banks with a global bank that has footprint in 12 countries. As a premium customer he has a privilege card that he can use anywhere in the world. He is in Brazil on business and does not speak Portuguese. Sam is looking for an ATM machine. He says, ‘Ok, Google Glass, where is the closest ATM?’ His bank, which has tracked his location, (with his permission, of course) guides him through the GPRS and translates instructions into English. Sam’s bank follows the policy of abundant precaution; sends a one time password for each ATM transaction. He receives this on his GG and completes the transaction. The job’s done.
Take this consumer, Jane. She loves adventure cycling and as an active group member she has organised an expedition to the Rocky Mountains bike trails. Jane has a new media subscription and receives the bill in her electronic mailbox while on the cycling expedition. She scans it, takes a picture with her GG, and makes the payment through her bank account.
In step with the future
Technology is constantly getting updated — a case in point is the smart phone before and after ‘touch’ technology. Google Glass will keep growing with the tech growth curve.
There are two such technologies we are familiar with, which are currently not available; near field communication (NFC) and Projection capabilities. I am speculating these will be available in the next generations of GG.
The following two use cases explain how these two technologies work:
NFC: Ujjwal is tech savvy. He is surrounded by the latest gadgets at home and in the work place. This ‘Gadget Guru’ reviews the latest products for popular tech magazines. Ujjwal has NFC enabled on his GG. He has an e-wallet account with his bank.
His favourite shopping store is the electronic store. As he walks around the store he keeps adding products to the shopping cart by scanning through his GG.
At the self-check-out counter, Ujjwal completes the transaction using NFC for making the purchase. The consumer shopping experience has become that much easier.
Banks now have another opportunity for innovation in the design of e-wallet products.
Wall projection: Jim, a financial advisor, does not like carrying a laptop for discussions with his clients. He prefers to make presentations with his GG. During client discussions, Jim uses projection capabilities to illustrate the details. This is more productive as he has ready access to a wide range of information residing in the ‘cloud’.
The internet’s the thing and the interplay of cloud, social media, mobility and analytics will be the foundation of all things we do. A new lifestyle to look forward to! And the financial industry will need to evolve with more innovation in mobility banking.
Wearable devices will replace laptops and tablets in the long run and bring in a new generation of people who will see very differently, think very differently and demand a personalised experience without parallel.
This will mark the emergence of Gen GG.

SBI launches first homegrown economic indexSBI launches first homegrown economic index
Our Bureau
The index is built to be ‘conservative yet robust’ in its forecast of market sentiment
Mumbai, December 9:  
For the first time, a domestic bank will start giving a forward-looking economic index. The State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, will use its loan book to give indicators on the domestic manufacturing activity from the New Year.
The SBI Composite Index will have both monthly and yearly indices. The short-term report, to be released in the first week of every month, will forecast the state of the economy two months down the line. The annual index will make year-on-year forward predictions.
Similar economic forecasts published by British lender HSBC, with global business survey compiler Markit, are the HSBC India Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), HSBC India Manufacturing PMI and the Markit India Business Outlook.
Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Advisor at SBI’s economic research department, said SBI’s figures are not intended to rival HSBC’s numbers.
However, during the eight years of back-testing (2007-2014), the SBI index accurately predicted economic direction 72 per cent of the time while the PMI had a 50 per cent strike rate.
Arundhati Bhattacharya, Chairperson and Managing Director, SBI, said the index will take into account the credit demand and other indicators of economic activity like consumer spending, mining activity, interest rates, inflation, exchange rate and other thematic indices and service and manufacturing activities. “We are there across the country. Our loan portfolio is well distributed across all segments. That is one of our strengths. As we are a pan-India bank, we don’t have any segment or geographical bias,” she said.
The SBI will also use public data on industrial production, international trade, commodity prices and current and futures prices in the stock markets to forecast possible expansion or contraction of the economy.
To represent the manufacturing sector, SBI will use the monthly Index of Industrial Production data rather than GDP figures, which are released ever quarter. The SBI index is built to be “conservative yet robust” in its forecast.
On the other hand, the HSBC manufacturing index is based on data compiled from replies to questionnaires sent out to purchasing executives in around 500 manufacturing companies, covering factors such as new orders, purchases, output and delivery time.
Like the HSBC indices, the SBI index is built on a scale of 0 to 100, with a number above 50 indicating growth over the corresponding pervious period and a number below 50 suggesting contraction.

Conversations with a lady taxi driver

What happens when there is a reversal of roles within the prescribed male-female public commuting norms?
Even against the faint orange light — the harbinger of dawn — the contours of her face were obvious. She looked charming, a little plump, and wore a pale salwar kameez. A dupatta was neatly draped over her head, just the way many Indian Muslim women are seen when outdoors.
As the taxi steered towards the main street, she drew my attention to a small tea shop around the bend where she had sipped cups of coffee just before picking me up. “I didn’t want to doze off...,” she said. The journey had been delayed since she found it difficult to track my address sooner. She was apologetic about having made me wait.
After a sleepless night, I thought it best to maintain indifference even as she persisted with her explanations. However, soon enough, the intrigue started to get to me — my efforts to nap had also proven futile. It was barely dawn and I was being driven to the airport by a woman, who was confident and also eager to make conversation. How many women in our country are allowed this space? Not many, even by Mumbai’s standards. And when we compare this to what happened in New Delhi a couple of days ago, it seems even more extraordinary.
A young woman was allegedly raped by the driver of the Uber cab she was travelling in. This crime also drew memories of the horror that took place in a moving bus in the same city two years ago. Where can a woman feel safe? Apparently, not even in the ‘safest’ means of transport (enabled with the latest GPS technology).
Reversal of roles
When I had booked this cab I hadn’t anticipated a female driver (this wasn’t even an all-female cab service). But here I was, seated comfortably in a case of reversal of roles within the prescribed male-female public commuting norms. If I were the driver and she the passenger, how different would the mood have been? Would she have been as chirpy? Did she feel safer in the driver’s seat? Did a steering wheel make all the difference? I wouldn’t know.
Although I didn’t want to appear as prying, I asked this woman when she started driving cabs. “Since he deserted me, my husband,” she said. “I am dead to my family. I am a Brahmin, he a Muslim. It was bound to get my family a bad name... How could I feed myself? I had to do something.”
It was 10 years ago when she eloped with a Muslim man from her hometown, Vadodara. The boy worked as a mechanic in Mumbai. While it seemed familiar terrain — the vagaries of inter-religious affairs, elopements and parental opposition — I was hooked on to her obviously unprompted narration. Given the “love jihad” myth spread by Hindutva groups, I was curious to hear this though. The woman told me her original name: it stood for ‘beautiful’ in Sanskrit; her name post-conversion to Islam was the Arabic word for ‘sky.’
Her story, however, hit a deadlock as she abruptly stopped talking — perhaps, realising she was revealing too much to a stranger (a man) — and I honestly didn’t know what to ask next. There was silence, the longest since the cab started. Noticing me fiddle with my phone — I meant to check the time — she ended the awkward pause: “Are you a reporter?” If I told her the truth she would not talk anymore so I kept my reply vague. “I still have relatives in Mumbai. Now if you go and report this they will say I go around telling my problems to everyone.”
Her husband divorced her eight years ago and married a Muslim woman. Not only did he keep their children, all she was left with was Rs. 3,000 as alimony. Making ends meet proved difficult; she shared space with six other women in a suburban Mumbai flat. Her flat mates, too, were ‘deserted’ and drove cabs.
“I was pretty fluent with the Quran as well,” she continued. “But Muslims have such bad customs, no?” she laughed sarcastically as she claimed that her ex-husband had already moved on to his third wife.
Her abrupt shifts in temper occasionally puzzled me. She suddenly turned her head towards me and said: “Don’t you feel bad when something like this happens? A Hindu woman is converted to Islam and then ditched... use and throw?” I would feel bad for anyone who was deserted, regardless of religion, I responded.
Probably mistaking this for my sympathy towards her ‘Muslim’ ex-husband, she stared at me for a short while, and correctly guessed my religion. “It’s the way you speak. I spent years with one... so I know alright,” she said.
Elopment, marriage and after
Since she had eloped, going back to Gujarat was not a viable option. With no source of living, she worked petty jobs for three years before shifting to driving cabs. There was little support from her family, which did not even bother to stay in touch. Her brother, a builder, did not spare her a penny. Despite the misery, she put on a brave face each time she was overcome with emotion.
“I have been single for a long time. But I enjoy life. We (the girls) go out for coffee sometimes; pull the cabs out for a spin at night,” she said. “We also go for picnics once in a while; even films. But we share the costs. Nobody is a burden on anyone.”
Her love story was typical of inter-religious Indian romances — secretive in initial phases but with the swords of scandal and heartbreak dangling dangerously over their heads. In the days before mobile phones hijacked romance, she would exchange love notes with her lover till her mother caught hold of one such note on one unfortunate day. Sensing a tragic end to their tale, she braved the wrath of her family and eloped.
The two had no clue of what next and started living in his garage till the landlord, critical of an unmarried couple living together on his premises, suggested they get married. They tied the knot and she converted to Islam. “I did not know anything then. Had seen nothing in life, just followed him. Love is blind...how true,” she murmured.
I asked for her ex-husband’s name. “Omar,” she replied. Her answer was prompt, but it left me too embarrassed to respond. She told me she had a fancy for her Arabic name, but it was also a grim reminder of her tragic love life. “It also makes me angry... tell me... Isn’t my anger justified? I can’t forget it.”
For a moment or two, I was discomfited by my own name. But I also dreaded how the right-wing Hindutva groups could have manipulated her story to include it within the template of “love jihad.” The Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s disregard for individual choices of marriage and relationships is well known.
The taxi soon came to a smooth halt at the airport. As I reached out to grab money from my cargo-shorts, she looked at me and giggled mischievously. “You are not even ready for the flight.” I smiled, paid her the promised amount and started to drag my rucksack out of the taxi. As I was about to shut the car’s door, she asked for my name. Sensing no escape, I managed to mumble it. Perhaps she didn’t hear me over the din of the airport announcements and asked me to repeat it. I did. She was taken aback, then smiled, shook her head as if to revive herself from the shock, then gave a sigh and laughed. It all happened too fast. Her focus then shifted to the steering wheel as she prepared to ride away into the crowd, but not before I caught her stealing a last glance at me.

Gene therapy makes a slow comebackGene therapy makes a slow comeback
VIDYA RAM
Double helix Hope and apprehension are intertwined KTSDESIGN/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM
Ethical questions are crucial, but they shouldn’t stall the progress of this promising branch of medicine
In late November, Reuters reported a milestone in medical history: a gene therapy drug could go on sale in Germany next year, after winning the approval of European regulators two years ago. The drug, Glybera, by a Dutch firm called UniQure — currently being scrutinised by Germany’s federal joint committee — would be the first commercial use of gene therapy in the Western world (China has had a gene therapy drug for a specific form of cancer in the market since 2004). This marks a potential turning point in an area of medicine that has been the subject of highs and lows over more than two decades of clinical trials.
Gene therapy — which can involve a number of things, including replacing a malfunctioning gene or introducing a new gene with the ability to fight a disease — has been in conceptual development for far longer. Its origins could be said to go back as early as the 1920s, well before the discovery of the structure of DNA, when a British scientist, Frederick Griffith, put forward what he described as the “transforming principle”; he successfully converted a non-virulent strain of bacteria into a virulent one, after injecting mice with both.
Genes in action
From the late 1960s, when the concept of gene therapy began to involve, it took several decades for the first clinical trial to take place in 1990. A young girl in the US with a genetic defect that had left her with a severely weakened immune system was successfully injected with her own white blood cells containing a corrected form of the malfunctioning gene.
However, the boost gene therapy got following that first successful trial was soon tarnished, in the view of the public, by a tragedy in 1999; an 18-year-old American boy, who had a mild version of a liver condition, which meant his body couldn’t process ammonia, died during a gene therapy treatment. This was after a massive response by his immune system to the vector — or carrier — used to introduce the corrected gene.
The episode raised a number of issues — including that of informed consent of those participating in clinical trials as well as the fact that identifying and correcting a defective gene was far from the only challenge facing gene therapy. Selecting the appropriate vector was also vital and not without risks.
Despite predictions that gene therapy would be lastingly damaged by the tragedy, research and trials continued — with many promising results for a range of conditions ranging from immune system conditions to cancer, cystic fibrosis, Parkinson’s disease and hemophilia.
The renewed confidence in gene therapy is highlighted by the fact that the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies have also entered the market (earlier this week, Pfizer announced collaboration with Spark Therapeutics, a Philadelphia based company on the development of a hemophilia B treatment).
Over 1,700 approved gene therapy trials have taken place in the past two decades, estimated an article on the history of gene therapy in Gene magazine last year — with many successes and a few hits. Among the latter were trials conducted in France in 2001 on Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, a condition where the immune system is so crippled that in one case it required a boy to live in a germ-free bubble. Several infants involved in the trial subsequently developed leukemia, though other clinical trials for gene therapy since have been successful.
A matter of debate
There have been some understandable public concerns about gene therapy and its impact — on the one hand it offers that tantalising potential of curing some of the most lethal conditions while on the other, tampering with genetic makeup is something that has long conjured up fears in the public imagination of genetic engineering and exacerbating discrimination against those with disabilities and disease.
However, it is important to note that at this stage clinical trials and gene therapy itself are limited to work on somatic cells — and not germ cells — meaning that genetic changes won’t be passed on to future generations.
There are other major questions, of course — the few tragedies have highlighted the ongoing challenges facing researchers, particularly around a suitable and safe vector. The complexity of the procedures involved (and their risks) also raises significant questions about what constitutes informed consent, and the extent to which participants or their families could ever fully comprehend the risks involved, particularly when situations are very desperate (as is often the case with gene therapy, which is used just in cases where there are no alternative treatments).
Another focal point of concern has been cost — treatments at the moment tend to be very costly: the new drug Glybera is said to be going on sale for €53,000 a phial or €1.1 million for a treatment according to Reuters (a small discount would be applied if in Germany). It estimates only around 200 people across Europe would be eligible.
However, cost isn’t something that should stand in the way of gene therapy — while Glybera would treat a relatively rare condition, there are many therapies for far more common conditions in the works, for which the costs could be more quickly recouped, enabling it to be available at lower price points.
Huge gains
Another factor that cannot be discounted is the huge saving to individuals and healthcare systems if a gene therapy is successful, particularly compared to the ongoing treatment of a condition spread across a person’s lifetime.
Aside from vastly improving the lives of those with debilitating conditions it could also save people from horrific choices — in some cases parents who discover a significant anomaly in the womb might not have to face the terrible choice of keeping a foetus and watching a child suffer, and termination.
As gene therapy and our understanding of genetics gets more advanced, the ethical questions will undoubtedly become more complex, too. In particular, the ever-so-fine line between a malfunctioning gene or defect and an undesirable trait will become even finer.
This is particularly true as gene therapy increasingly moves beyond correcting a defective gene to investing cells with a gene with a power that it wouldn’t ordinarily have (say to combat cancer).
But these are not reasons to reject it — gene therapy and the move towards commercialisation is another example of what patient, meticulous research in a carefully regulated and ethically vetted field can achieve over the decades.

Nurturing agricultureTweet
The Centre should now focus on ensuring that farmers get a fair price for their produce
The steep fall in global agricultural commodity prices, after a multi-year bull run, is good news for Indian consumers as it is likely to hasten the decline in domestic inflation. But policymakers cannot afford to ignore the flip side of this trend. The emerging global glut in cash crops such as cotton, rubber, maize and sugar, which has sent their prices down by 15 to 20 per cent in the last six months, risks the precipitation of a crisis in Indian agriculture.
With global demand evaporating, exports of agricultural commodities such as cotton, rubber, tea and maize have come to standstill in recent months. With export prospects turning bleak and domestic prices under pressure from cheap imports, producers are now saddled with excess stocks that they are hard-pressed to liquidate. Agri-processing companies in sectors such as sugar, after reporting significant losses this year, have run up large dues to their farmers and are now desperately seeking a bailout. These trends have also forced the domestic market prices of agricultural crops such as rubber, maize and cotton below their minimum support prices (MSPs) in recent months. This is likely to have a direct and immediate impact on rural incomes, which were buoyed over the last five years by greater crop productivity and better realisations, thanks to booming exports. Given that rising rural affluence was a key driver of economic prosperity during this period, this is a shift that could well upset the nascent economic recovery.
What is needed at this juncture is a directional shift in the Centre’s policy priorities — from shielding consumers from runaway inflation to ensuring that farmers receive a remunerative price for their produce. Here, merely continuing with the old policy fixes of the UPA such as hiking MSPs for crops, dispensing low-cost agricultural loans or slapping ad hoc barriers on imports are unlikely to yield results as global pressures will quickly put paid to them. Instead, the Centre must push ahead with structural reforms in agricultural markets. As for sugar, it is time mills were allowed the flexibility of altering their product mix between sugar and ethanol and moving to a transparent market-linked cane pricing system, where farmers get a profit share. Nudging States to relax the provisions of the anti-market APMC Act, thereby giving farmers direct access to bulk buyers, is also the need of the hour. Steps to evolve a regulated national spot market for agri-commodities that can set benchmark prices and introduce commodity options (this requires the passage of the amended Forward Contracts Regulation Act) will empower farmers with better price intelligence. Direct benefit transfers for fertiliser and other input subsidies will provide income support to farmers at times of need. Without such reform measures, the BJP’s election promise ensuring a ‘minimum’ 50 per cent profit to farmers on their agricultural produce, will have a hollow ring.

Our untapped trade potential with RussiaOur untapped trade potential with Russia
SIDHARTH BIRLA
Tweet
Joint action The way forward NIYAZZ/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM
Russia, pushed back by the West, seeks to boost economic ties with India. It has plenty of expertise to offer
When Prime Minister Narendra Modi met President Vladimir Putin in Brazil during the Brics summit in July he told him: “Even a child in India if asked to say who is India's best friend will reply it is Russia because Russia has been with India in times of crisis”.Last month, Modi conveyed to Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin that India gives great importance to the special strategic partnership with Russia.
Rogozin was in New Delhi for preparatory talks for the annual Indo-Russian summit to be held on December 11. He also spoke at the eighth Indo-Russian Forum on Trade and Investments, the most important bilateral business engagement for the two governments.
Russian technology combined with Indian entrepreneurship and the new government’s business-friendly policies can give a big boost to our commercial relations. Economic and commercial relations have been the weakest link in our otherwise robust bilateral ties.
Lack of interest
Though the two governments had set a trade target of $20 billion by 2015, our current level of trade is just about $6 billion, according to data from the Indian side. At the end of 2013, India’s direct investment in Russia was about $3.4 billion, a large part of which in oil and gas blocks acquired by OVL. Russian investments in India amounted to a little more than $0.8 billion, mainly in telecom.
Somehow, there has been limited interest from the private sector on both sides. The main reason could be that we have only highlighted the risks associated with doing business.
Where do we go from here?
Both governments are paying attention to strengthening economic cooperation. Talks are on for greater engagement between India and the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan which will soon become the Eurasian Economic Union.
The upcoming North-South Corridor which envisages a ship, rail and road route from India’s west coast to Russia via Iran and Central Asia is expected to significantly reduce both shipping costs and transit time. Our businessmen should be encouraged to look beyond Moscow and St Petersburg and explore Russian regions rich in natural resources, have a well-developed infrastructure and are keen to establish business relations with India.
The Russian government’s decision to ban fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, milk and dairy imports from the US, EU, Australia and Canada is an opportunity for Indian companies. Russia has just allowed import of buffalo meat from India.
Alrosa, the only company authorised to export diamonds from Russia, is expected to enter into long-term supply contracts with Indian importers of rough diamonds. A Russian-Indian working group for high priority investment projects has been set up. The Russian side should consider participating in specific manufacturing projects in India.
On the infrastructure front
Russian companies also have considerable experience in developing infrastructure projects. India has invited Russian participation in the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and the Dedicated Freight Corridor — among the largest infrastructure projects in the world — along with the Bangalore-Mumbai Economic Corridor and the Chennai-Bangalore Industrial Corridor.
The Russian company Sistema has shown interest in building a ‘smart city’ in India. A formal agreement is likely to be signed during the upcoming summit. India and Russia are also expected to sign a number of agreements for close cooperation in defence, nuclear energy, oil and gas exploration, space, science and technology and aviation, among others.
However, certain challenges need to be overcome. Foremost is the visa regime, particularly for business visitors. A visa facilitation agreement between leading business associations of the two countries can address this issue.
The fall in global oil prices and the sanctions imposed by the West have started impacting the Russian economy. The rapid depreciation of the rouble has further aggravated the situation. It is in this context that Russia regards old friend India with a lot of expectations.
The summit meeting should see a redefined strategic vision.

Songdo - Too impersonal for comfortBarun Roy: Songdo - Too impersonal for comfort?
Barun Roy |  Dec 10, 2014 09:46 PM IST
Called the world's smartest city, being built entirely from scratch on 1,500 acres of reclaimed land along Incheon's waterfront, Songdo International Business District, 40 miles Southwest of Seoul, was just a marshy tidal flat in 2000. It was supposed to be ready by 2015, but is only 60 per cent complete as of now and perhaps won't be ready before 2018.
It's the largest private real estate development in history and some $40 billion has already been spent on it. Developers describe it as a global business hub. Purpose-built for low-carbon sustainable growth, it's supposed to have 40 per cent of its area dedicated to outdoor spaces with 16 miles of bicycle lanes, a central park, and waterways. There will be 100 main buildings in the district, including a trade centre claimed as Korea's tallest building.
But it's the proposed use of technology that's drawing the world's attention. There's a futuristic rubbish collection system spanning the whole complex. No rubbish truck will be seen on the streets. All household and office waste will be sucked through a network of underground ducts to vast sorting facilities for processing. All the sorted and treated waste will be turned into energy for the community. Sensors will monitor everything from temperature to energy consumption and traffic. Even water pipes are designed to stop clean water, suitable for human consumption, from being used in showers and toilets. All the embankment's water will go through a sophisticated recycling system.
But despite its proximity to Seoul and Incheon International Airport, less than 20 per cent of Songdo's commercial space is said to be occupied. In order to attract more people to Songdo, the developers are now investing heavily in setting up at least four universities, including a couple of them from overseas. Gale International, the American developer behind Songdo, hopes businesses will soon follow. Other private parties are Korea's Posco and America's Morgan Stanley Real Estate.
Tax breaks, estate support and subsidies are on the cards. No property tax will be levied for 10 years with 50 per cent reduction for the next three years. For now, Songdo remains an architect's model. Its wide sidewalks and roads are still waiting for pedestrians and cars. A "telepresence" system is still being tested, which will allow residents to sit in front of customised TV screens and take language or fitness lessons from instructors elsewhere in Korea. Mobile phones will control home appliances and microchips are to be inserted in bracelets to track children, evoking an Orwellian future.
This is perhaps scaring away people and businesses from Songdo. Even in a smart city, people want glimpses of history and a human touch. Songdo is turning out to be a history-less city, too impersonal for comfort. There's just not what some experts describe as a big bad urban centre. Living and doing business in a totally wired community may be attractive to some, but people may not enjoy a situation where one would always be open to snooping by others. Technology must have its limits and shouldn't rule our lives 24 hours a day and turn us into robots. And where's the guarantee that technology won't be misused by vested interests, fraudsters, and business rivals?
After completion, Songdo is planned to have 80,000 apartments, 50,000,000 sq ft of office space, and 10,000, 000 sq ft of retail space. But even in Songdo, residents won't stay young for all time and will keep ageing. Their reflexes will diminish. More than 50 years ago, Brasilia was launched as the world's first ever smartest city. But Brasilia was an instant disaster, grandiose, monstrously over-scale, and immediately encircled by slums.

Bentleys woo China to London as Russians pack for homeMatthew Campbell: Bentleys woo China to London as Russians pack for home
Matthew Campbell |  Dec 10, 2014 09:46 PM IST
London's Jack Barclay Bentley dealership has hosted British aristocrats, Russian industrialists and Arab sheiks in its 87-year history. Until this year, it had never held a Chinese New Year celebration.
In February, the dealership invited more than 200 wealthy Chinese expatriates from fields like finance and real estate to a Year of the Horse-themed event under the slogan "take the reins for a prosperous journey." And, of course, Chinese-speaking staff were on hand, ready to rhapsodise about the pleasures of a car favoured by the royal family and rap stars alike.
"A quintessentially English dealership could be quite intimidating" for Chinese buyers, said Chris Harris, marketing director for luxury automotive group HR Owen, which owns Jack Barclay.
From luxury retailers to law firms to banks, Londoners are jockeying to take advantage of a wave of Chinese investment and tourism. With Russia, India and West Asia struggling with weak commodity prices, businesses that cater to wealthy foreigners are betting Chinese money can make up the difference.
The property sector is seeing some of the most dramatic increase, with real-estate investment in the British capital from China tripling from 2012 to 2013 to about $2.8 billion, a figure that will probably be matched this year, according to broker Knight Frank.
$20-million yachts
Chinese-financed projects include One Nine Elms, a 56-story apartment tower on the south bank of the Thames backed by developer Dalian Wanda. And Shanghai-based Greenland Holding Group this year said it would invest £1.2 billion pounds redeveloping a brewery in the city's leafy south-west and building a residential tower near Canary Wharf.
Chinese buyers are also taking their first steps into corporate dealmaking in Britain. In July, private equity firm Hony Capital said it would buy UK restaurant chain Pizza Express for about $1.4 billion - the largest-ever corporate takeover in Britain by a mainland Chinese company. The previous summer, Dalian Wanda agreed to pay $451 million for Sunseeker International, a London manufacturer of yachts that sell for as much as $20 million.
The increased presence is partly a function of China's diversifying economy, said Nicola Mayo, a partner at law firm Linklaters who just returned to London after four years in Shanghai. "China Inc is looking strategically at more sectors beyond natural resources."
Some companies are using British deals to strengthen their position back home. Investment firm Sanpower Group this year took control of House of Fraser in a transaction valuing the Oxford Street department store at £450 million; It's now planning dozens of branches in China. Pizza Express expects to build new restaurants in the Mainland as interest in Italian-style fare picks up there.
Prime Minister David Cameron has made a concerted effort to strengthen ties with China amid criticism from business leaders that Britain has slipped behind the US, Canada and Australia in courting Beijing. Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang joined Queen Elizabeth for tea when he visited London in June, and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is promoting a plan to make London a hub for trading China's yuan, for which the London Stock Exchange in June inked a "strategic partnership" with Bank of China Ltd.
Orange diamond
Two years ago, Boodles, a jeweller with five London stores, had no Chinese speakers on staff. Today it has two and is looking for a third as more than five per cent of its business now comes from Chinese shoppers, up from one per cent five years ago, says managing director Michael Wainwright. One Chinese customer who "we made a huge sale to last year wants an orange diamond," Wainwright said. "You're looking at a million pounds-plus. We know this person can spend this kind of money."
Chinese shoppers have accounted for a quarter of retail purchases by overseas visitors in London this year, according to duty-free shopping provider Global Blue - up from 14 per cent in 2012.
The Chinese wave is arriving as London weans itself from a dependence on wealthy Russians, who provided steady work both to professional-services firms and the luxury sector. Amid European Union sanctions over Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin's government has urged Russian companies to de-list from foreign stock exchanges and told billionaires to repatriate assets.
Passport-free travel
Obstacles remain to a whole-hearted embrace of China in London. The UK government recently criticised China's decision to block a delegation of British lawmakers from visiting Hong Kong as part of an inquiry into conditions in the former colony, which has been rocked by pro-democracy protests. And China's breakneck economic growth is slowing to below seven per cent as a housing boom slows, which could curtail foreign investment and tourism in the UK and elsewhere.
More prosaically, Heathrow airport has trailed Frankfurt and Paris in developing new routes to China because of runway capacity limits. Britain has captured just 14 per cent of the growth in flights from China to Europe over the last 20 years, with 34 per cent going to Germany and 22 per cent in France, figures from the Confederation of British Industry show.

How To Apply for a "Best Companies to Work For" List -- and Why It s Worth the Troublereddit
Each year you see them--shouting from business journals, websites, magazine covers... "Best Companies to Work For" lists are everywhere: there are local and regional lists, industry-based lists, company-size-based lists, lists devoted to non-profits, lists devoted to law firms, lists devoted to specific jobs and specific types of workers.
Have you ever wondered how companies land on those lists? Are they just the opinion of some editor, pulled together randomly and slapped on the page to make a sale? Or perhaps there is some secret committee somewhere, sifting through nominations and handing them down from on high, like a Nobel prize?
The truth is, no "best place to work" awards I know of are simply the result of an editor's whim. And while a few, like Glassdoor's Employees' Choice Awards and Indeed's Best Places to Work , are based entirely on published employee feedback, in most cases you've got to apply to be considered for these lists.
Some applications are pretty basic. For example, relative newcomer AWLP's Seal of Distinction relies on a simple checklist of policies and programs. Moving up the complexity scale, many of the local, regional, and industry-based lists (including the various city-based Crain's Best Places to Work lists), have a standard format that includes a survey for employees to complete and a section for employers, with both check-the-box questions and short essays, generally ranging from 250-750 words. (There's a reason, by the way, that most of the various applications in this category all look so similar--they are administered by the same organization, Best Companies Group .)
Finally, there are the grand-dames of "Best Companies to Work For" lists: Working Mother 100 Best Companies (and its cousins, a handful of more specific lists all administered by Working Mother Media) and Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, administered by the Great Place to Work Institute. Getting yourself considered for one of these lists takes a serious commitment. The Fortune 100 Best application, replete with more than a dozen completely open-ended essay questions, may give you flashbacks to your college thesis days. But since right now we're at the start of Working Mother season (the application is released this Friday, and must be completed and returned by March 13) let's focus for now on that one.
How to Apply for the Working Mother 100 Best list
In order to be considered for the Working Mother list, you'll need to answer some 500 questions relating to your company's demographics, programs and practices, hiring/firing data, etc. You'll also be asked to write an essay of up to 2,500 words. Although the administrators of this award emphasize that it is not just about working mothers, there is, not surprisingly, a strong emphasis on programs to support gender equity and work-life balance. The questions get at not only what a company claims it has to offer but on how these offerings are promoted, how much they are actually used and who uses them.
Note that the answers are graded more or less on a curve, in that the winning 100 companies are simply those with the highest scores. Which means the bar goes up and down, depending on which companies are applying in any given year. Of course, once a company gets onto the list, it tends to re-apply each year--so in that sense, the bar is on a steady upward course. It has also risen lately because list administrators at Working Mother have added a couple of basic eligibility requirements: in addition to some existing requirements based on size, industry (no work-life consultants need apply), etc., companies must offer at least one week paid maternity leave and some form of flex-work--just to be considered.
Two, Two, Two Lists In One!
One neat thing about the Working Mother application is that it can put you in the running for an additional Best Company list, as well. Applicants can opt to have their answers applied to the annual NAFE Top Companies for Executive Women list (also sponsored by Working Mother Media). All you have to do to take advantage of this option is check a box--and write one additional essay. The judges simply take your existing answers to relevant questions (such as those related to women's advancement) and apply them to the NAFE competition.
Why Bother?
Why go to all the trouble of completing this lengthy application? Certainly getting on one of these lists is a feather in the cap for your organization and by extension--if you are the one in charge of making it happen--for you. But that's just the start.
According to Jennifer Owens, Director of the Working Mother Research Institute, when the Working Mother list is released each fall it gets millions of media impressions. Next year (when the results of the current application are published) will be the recognition's 30th anniversary year--a fact that should garner it even more publicity than usual.
A number of my own clients have told me that all this attention is a tremendous boon for recruitment, and Owens concurs: "I get people who email me all the time saying they're using the list when they're looking for jobs. And companies use the designation in their recruitment. It says an awful lot in just five words."
I've also had clients tell me they see a drop in employees leaving the company, once they get on the list.
All that said, the real business benefits of being on a list like this come from having the programs and policies that get you on the list. Owens points out that the application process, itself, can be enlightening. Questions, which are based on the current state of affairs for family-friendly policies and programs in progressive companies, can provide helpful insights into best practices, while researching their answers can be an illuminating exploration of the state of things at your own company. Plus, Working Mother Media and most other list sponsors reward applicants--even those that don't make the list--with basic (aggregate) benchmarking information, comparing their application responses with those of other applicants. More in-depth benchmarking analyses are generally also available, for a fee.
By the way, none of these Best Company lists discloses the names of applicants that don't make it, so in that sense there is no downside to applying.
In sum?
Getting on one of the premier "Best Companies to Work For" lists involves a sometimes daunting application process, followed by the potential for some intriguing rewards. My suggestion? Stop waiting around to be anointed from on high--roll up your sleeves and give it a try!

41 Things Shared in a Roomful of Millionairesreddit
CERTAINTY.
Imagine if you knew, for certain, that you could make exactly the income you desire, do exactly the work you're most called to do, leave exactly the legacy you most want to leave, and be exactly the YOU who you most want to be.
Well, good news. I'm here to tell you that you can have it all, you can have it exactly on your terms, and you can start now. But if you want it? You're going to have to be willing to take it, and it will NOT look how you think it might.
I'm blessed to have spent 4 days out of the past week in a room with some of the world's leading entrepreneurs and game-changers. Of 39 in the room, 23 can call themselves millionaires ... I'm proud to say I snuck into that group of 23!
We not only spent hours in conference discussing LIFE MASTERY over the course of our time together but also spent time with our families - dinner parties each evening, karaoke, a Luau, a day on a 70-foot catamaran, snorkelling with sea turtles, and even a cheeky night out ... all in all an amazing weekend, and in many ways I still pinch myself to have created a life where I can call people in a group like that even my acquaintances, let alone friends!
But here's the thing - you might think that when a group of the worlds' top entrepreneurs get together the discussions around sales, and marketing and 'what's working' abound.
No. Niet. Nein. Nicht so.
You would be wrong.
Let me give you a hint, a teaser, if you will -
You think that the reason you're not making the money you want, living the life you want, making the DIFFERENCE you want to make is because you just need to figure out the right plan, the right strategy, get the latest, the greatest, the best! Well guess what?
There is no magic bullet and for every wannabe entrepreneur out there chasing STRATEGY and beating their head against the wall of repeated and constantly impending disaster there is, well, another person who is allowing their dreams, their vision, their God-darn CALLING to be DESTROYED.
And I can tell you with certainty - (and I'm just a little fired up about it, in case you can't tell!) -
If YOU are out there looking for the missing link to why you're not yet making that money, living that life, then guess what?
It's about time you sit down and face facts -
You're NEVER going to get there by trying to get there.
There IS no path you just need to find, not in the sense of finding 'what's working now' in the world of business or success or whatever the heck it is you're chasing.
And the ONLY thing standing in your way?
Is you.
I did this to myself for a long time, so don't feel bad - you're not alone. For months, okay years, I told myself I just needed the right strategy. A funnel! A back end! A front end! A system! To learn from the right people! To make a BUSINESS MAP.
It was all. just. bullshit.
But valiantly I fought to make it work! I gave it my ALL! I gave it everything, and I DID everything.
Except for the one thing that actually needed to be done.
Which was, quite simply, to give it me, and to be me.
Now I've known this for a while, or I like to think so. I am ALL about finding alignment and being completely AUTHENTIC in your business, because I've found that when you are?
Strategy can get fucked.
But truth be told, I thought, when I planned to come and attend a conference as part of a Mastermind that is 2/3 millionaires and in several cases MULTI-millionaires, that I'd be learning, well, yes - the STRATEGY I need to deepen what I'm creating in my business funnel, my lead generation, my sales and my marketing.
No. Niet. Nein. NICHT so!
I was wrong.
And I can tell you with certainty that if right now your STRATEGY for your business is not making you the MONEY you desire, then it is NOT because you aren't up on the latest sales and marketing must-do, it's not because your website isn't finished (or pretty!), and it's not even because you've never got around to doing that SEO keyword thingy.
It's because your internal shit needs some serious cleaning up!
It was thrilling to me to have this notion validated by a roomful of millionaires - in my business, in my personal life, and with my clients my PRIMARY focus for some time has been on getting into alignment and clarity about what you are here to do, who you truly want to serve, and HOW you actually want to create that ideal business and life. I've found that by working with people INTERNALLY - on money mindset, on deservedness, on being YOU, just for a few examples - that THE MONEY ALWAYS FOLLOWS.
But don't take my word for it. Here's what a room full of millionaires had to say!
1. Stuck? Get the fuck over it. You can choose to do that you know!
2. Adequacy vs Excellence - just start choosing excellence BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST CHOOSE.
3. People invest dollars to learn what you know - and they invest big dollars to be who you are. Who do you want to be?
4. The thing you want to do or be or have 'when you get there' IS the way to get there (i.e. flying first class, dropping that thing, doing that other thing).
5. You cannot punish yourself into being a superstar.
6. Determination and focus to be the best at what you do is what will create your success.
7. Choose your environment - choose to hang with the top dogs in order to BE one.
8. Deal with your shit (debt, family stuff, fitness).
9. Constant self development is a MUST.
10. Repeatedly focus on what you want - get it in your body and set a specific time goal.
11. Income generation is within your control once you know what you're going for.
12. Be congruent with what you're selling.
13. Palm off the stuff you're not good at.
14. Be the ideal client (I love this one, and am thinking about how I can FULLY embody it!).
15. When considering how much time to spend on business vs other areas of your life - match what you're saying is important.
16. Throw out the method and just show up and be yourself - just from who you are you can make it.
17. Sales and transformation is a practice NOT A STRATEGY.
18. Make sure you communicate your true contribution - people need to know what you REALLY do for them.
19. (My personal favourite) Be the master at what you do and focus on that one thing.
20. (Another favourite!) Start regarding yourself in a different way - you are how you see yourself to be. Think FROM it, not of it. "This is who I am now", and act accordingly.
21. What are you settling for?
22. ONCE YOU ARE BEING YOU - have a SYSTEM and dial it in.
23. Have a Daily Practice i.e. visualisations, gratitude, following your calling or purpose.
24. Be honest with where you are and then choose where you want to be.
25. What is the biggest thing you need to shift? What is distracting you from your mission?
26. It's not what you need it's what you choose. HINT: THIS IS A HINT.
27. If you want something you don't have to 'work' to get it, you just accept it.
28. RECEIVE - just CHOOSE to receive.
29. OVER deliver on value to your key clients.
30. Put yourself first.
31. Your back end should be doing 70-80% of your business.
32. Value what you do and stay true to it and DO IT.
33. You have exactly what you need and chose, stop worrying about it.
34. Stop doing the grunt work if you want to be a leader!
35. Stop fighting to make it complex, simplicity wins.
36. There is always a payoff - what is it?
37. Make space for the things you want to come in.
38. You can't suffer your way to success.
39. There is no happy ending to an unhappy journey.
40. More success is coming - trust and act accordingly.
41. (and a very apt ending to this list) Listen to your gut.
Now here's the thing.
You can read a list like this, and nod your head at much of it, choose to be inspired and moved by it, even fired up.
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
It's not enough to agree that yes! The answer is faith. Or yes! The answer is alignment. Or yes! The answer is being the best you that you can be.
Knowing the ANSWER does jack SHIT if you do not USE the answer.
So if you read a list like this and you nod your head sagely (as I for so long used to with this sort of thing, and as sadly some people I speak to still do), but then you go back to your fear and your panic and your OMG I need to make money, and I'll just get on top of things first, make a plan, get a system, build my funnel, finish what I'm doing, well -
You are royally screwed.
By yourself, no less.
And the very sad thing is that even though the points on this post, shared THROUGH me not FROM me, are literally worth in the MULTI-MILLIONS, the VAST majority of people will do nothing with them.
And will keep on chasing that magic bullet, all the while swearing that they know there IS no magic bullet.
It's kind of crazy, if you think about it.
So, my challenge to you -
Think about it.
What are you doing, who are you being, how are you living, right now, in your life, that is keeping you where you are?
You have a choice every single day and guess what? You MAKE that choice every single day. So if you're not where you want to be THEN MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE.
As a mentor I used to focus on the best sales and lead gen and marketing strategy. I was queen of the latest and greatest! It was the very worst thing I could do for my clients and for myself.
And I learned my lessons, because ultimately? That stuff is worthless without alignment, without soul purpose, without LEARNING HOW TO BE YOU.
So I learned how to be me ... big time and ALL the way.
And then I started teaching others how to figure out how to be them.
Now I am honoured to DAILY get to lead and guide a new wave of top entrepreneurs to be themselves, ALL out, and to operate both business and life from a place of alignment and truth.
And the strategy? Is the least of what we do, it's the cherry on top. Which is fun to put on but hey! Not essential.
So let me ask you -
ARE YOU FOCUSING ON THE ESSENTIAL RIGHT NOW?
Are you doing what's in ALIGNMENT?
Are you DOING YOU?
Or are you battling to make. things. work.
And if so - how's that working out for you?
Remember -
Life is Now. Press Play.

U.S. Churches and the Boycott of Israeli Settlementsreddit
Why are some churches in the U.S. calling for boycotts and divestment aimed at companies that profit from Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories? The decision last summer of the Presbyterian Church USA (CPUSA) to divest church pension funds from three such companies resulted in first-page coverage in The New York Times . A few weeks ago a grassroots group of pastors and lay members of the United Methodist Church (UMC) launched a holiday-season campaign to boycott products made in Israeli settlements located on occupied Palestinian land. While this group of Methodists is not an official agency of the UMC, it bases its boycott call on a 2012 decision of the policy-making body of the church calling "on all nations to prohibit any financial support by individuals or organizations for the construction and maintenance of settlements; and also to prohibit the import of products made by companies in Israeli settlements."
While mainline protestant churches were generally very supportive of the creation of Israel after World War II, the 1970s witnessed growing criticism of Israel's occupation of Arab land. Since then, various church organizations around the world, including in the U.S., have issued numerous declarations affirming that an end to the occupation was a prerequisite for a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. However, as the decades rolled by and Israel continued to expand its illegal settlements, to the consternation of the international community, voices started calling on their churches to " put [their] money where [their] mouth is ."
Of course, Christian missions from all around the world have maintained a salient presence in historical Palestine/Israel for centuries. While the indigenous Palestinian Christians have dwindled as a percent of the population, hundreds of churches dot the landscape not only in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth but in dozens of Palestinian towns and villages in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinian Christians continue to be heavily represented in leadership positions in their communities, and their narrative of suffering under Israel's occupation is all but identical to that of the majority Palestinian Muslims. Christian missionaries are also not confined to their religious institutions but play a vital role in providing health and educational services to Palestinians, Muslims and Christians alike. Foreign missionaries, therefore, witness firsthand the depravities and humiliation that Palestinians face in their daily lives.
Some foreign Christians have, over the years, extended their humanitarian services to activities that directly confront the oppressive conditions that Palestinians face in their daily lives. For example, the Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) recruits volunteers from all over the world to collaborate with local Palestinian and Israeli peacemakers in nonviolent, grassroots resistance to the Israeli occupation. According to CPT , the teams do this by:
Providing daily accompaniment for Palestinian children walking to and from school
Accompanying Palestinian shepherds and farmers to fields where Israeli settlers often assault them
Monitoring treatment of Palestinians at Israeli military checkpoints and roadblocks
Intervening during human rights abuses and violations, including Israeli military invasions of Palestinian homes and markets
In 2009 a group of clergy and lay leaders representing all major Palestinian Christian denominations issued the Kairos Palestine document, calling upon the international community to boycott and divest from companies that profit from the Israeli occupation. The document asserts:
Through our love, we will overcome injustices and establish foundations for a new society both for us and for our [Israeli Jewish] opponents. Our future and their future are one. [The choice is between] the cycle of violence that destroys both of us or peace that will benefit both.
The U.S. Methodists urging their church and others to boycott Israeli settlements products adopted the name United Methodist Kairos Response (UMKR), inspired by this call. UMKR follows a long tradition of spiritual support for forms of resistance that pose as a sane alternative to violent conflict in different parts of the world.  They, and similar groups associated with other Christian denominations, point to prominent spiritual leaders who have set examples of nonviolent involvement in otherwise bloody struggles. They include names like Mahatma Gandhi , Dorothy Day , Bishop Desmond Tutu , Archbishop Oscar Romero , and, of course, Martin Luther King.
Of course, this movement for economic measures against Israeli settlements is not confined to mainline Christian Protestants. In fact, Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) is among the foremost groups in the U.S. advocating for boycotting products made in the settlements. JVP has, incidentally, experienced phenomenal growth after Israel's latest attack on the Gaza Strip, not only among young, secular Jews but even among some rabbis around the U.S.
Both JVP and Christian advocates of boycotts and divestment see Israel's bellicose policies as destructive not only to Palestinians but also to Israeli Jews. The involvement of churches in this growing international movement indicates that concern for a just and lasting peace for Palestinians and Israelis is finally making inroads into mainstream American society.

#ExceptionalCareers Series: Who Are Your Champions and Have You Thanked Themreddit
As we plan out our career futures, how often do we reflect on our past and thank those who championed us and helped us recognize our value even before we started a career? And why is doing so such an important building block in our journey towards success?
Recently, Caroline Fairchild shared a personal story with me.  Before I launch into the story, let me first tell you a little bit about Caroline.  She is the 24 year old editor in charge of Fortune's newest e-pub, The Broadsheet , built on its Most Powerful Women (MPW) brand.  Each day, Caroline curates top stories, zones in on hot- button issues, and offers a unique inner circle perspective on women's leadership.   In just a few short months, under Caroline's keen eye and engaging writing style, The Broadsheet has grown to tens of thousands of subscribers.
Caroline Fairchild (pictured far right), moderating a panel at the Fortune MPW Next Gen Summit
As with any start up endeavor, she is constantly on the go.  During an especially busy week, she received an email from her dad.  "You are the most powerful woman and don't forget it."  This type of championship was nothing new for Caroline. Each week since high school, her dad would send her magazine and news clipping of stories that he thought were important for her to read, or words of encouragement. Because of her dad's actions, Caroline developed a confidence and drive that came to characterize her personal brand today.
In an entirely different arena, Shane Battier, a COLE Sr. Fellow, told me about the way his parents helped him navigate the challenges of growing up biracial. They helped him to recast the adversity into a learning opportunity and recognize that which makes him different can in fact be a tremendous strength.
If you were to meet Shane in person, what you would notice first is his complete ease with being outside of his comfort zone. Shane has won two NBA Championships with the Miami Heat, in addition to other impressive achievements on his scorecard.  A key competitive advantage on the court and off, is his leadership ability to knit people who are very different from one another into tight cohesive teams.
While I've talked about parents, the people who have championed us in our career journey don't necessary have to be family members.  I've had the privilege of being a part of the Emily K Center ,  a wonderful organization that helps more than 200 first grade to high school scholars each year break the cycle of poverty and gain access to college through after school programs and mentorship.
Ashlea Hitchcock proudly takes a picture with the graduating Emily K Center scholars
If you were to ask the kids at the Emily K Center who have helped them feel deeply valued and showed them their potential, they would point to Ashlea Hitchcock, Heather Hindin and Dalia Wimberly, who lead the student programming.   If you were to ask Ashlea, Heather, or Dalia why they do what they do, they would tell you that "every kid has a story," that every kid matters and that "their dreams and goals have become our hopes and dreams."  It's because of this mindset that many of the kids come to see the center as another home, another safe place where they can learn and grow.
Ashlea, Heather, and Dalia illustrate a critical aspect of this building block - they help those behind them to succeed.  Characteristic of those with exceptional careers, they, Caroline and Shane reflect on what those before them had done for them, and turn around and do those things for others.  Caroline is constantly sharing advice and connections with student groups and MPW hopefuls.  Shane founded the Battier Take Charge Foundation to provide support and scholarships for first generation college students.
So, as you think about your journey to building an exceptional career, I urge you to commit to two things:
One - Think back on your life and think about all those champions of your life, who believed in you even before you knew how to believe in yourself, and who gave you the time, love and support through the ups and downs and ordinary everyday moments. Reach out and thank them.
Two - Reflect on what they did that made you feel valued and helped you to grow.  Turn around and do those things- be that champion for others.
What better time to dive into this aspect of success than during this season of reflection and renewed connections?
My dad and me in the 80s at the National Air & Space Museum
For me, I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout out to my dad, who always challenged me to address problems through different perspectives; my mom, who taught me to get back up from failures and never rest on past achievements; and my husband (also my best editor), who always keeps me accountable to the things that are truly important in life.
So, readers, who are your champions? Please share in the comments and send in topics that you'd like to see in future posts. You can also tweet at me @SanyinSiang and #ExceptionalCareers.
Happy Holidays and see you in January.

China must manage its slowdown to keep the global economy safeChina must manage its slowdown to keep the global economy safe
Malini Bhupta | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 01:22 PM IST
Low commodity prices are a boon for a resource-hungry economy like India, which needs to import oil, coal and iron ore, among other commodities, to fuel its factory output.  So lower commodity prices is nothing less than a Godsend for India. With oil falling 40% over six months, the country’s oil import bill will decline substantially, adding up to almost 2% of GDP. This may be a natural stimulus and India should relish this moment, but commodity prices have been driven down because of other reasons, which pose equal downside risks for India. 
That China's growth has been slowing is well-known; India is expected to emerge as the fastest growing emerging market in a couple of years, as China's growth declines to 6% levels. But herein lies the risk. China used to grow in double digits and is used to having a balance of payment surplus of 10%. While growth is down to 7%, BoP surplus is down to 2%. 
Under normal circumstances, such a situation would lead to lower capital spending ability, but China has only increased its capital spending and it now is close to 50% of GDP, say economists. Exports growth is also down to single digits from the 20-30% from a few years ago. The massive stimulus of capital spending on unproductive assets has also resulted in marginal return on capital declining sharply. According to HSBC Global Research, it’s not impossible to imagine the development of a vicious circle whereby a lower marginal return leads to unacceptably low growth that triggers more pump-priming, higher levels of debt and an even lower marginal return.
If growth slows dramatically to 4-6 % levels in the next one year, the risk to global markets would be enormous as commodity prices would continue to fall further, besides a decline in trade momentum. This could, in a worst case scenario, lead to a global recession. So long as the Chinese government slows down growth in a gradual manner to undertake micro reforms, the world is safe, but if China's growth slows more sharply than anticipated, it would lead to a selloff in commodity markets and result in sharp volatility in currency markets.

Russian President in India: Major Developments in Energy and Defence sectorRussian President in India: Major Developments in Energy and Defence sector
Edible oil crushing down by 15-20% this yearEdible oil crushing down by 15-20% this year
Sharleen D'Souza | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 06:20 PM IST
Edible oil crushing this oil year (November to October) is expected to be lower compared to last year by 15-20% on the back of higher imports of edible oil as it is cheaper overseas coupled with lower arrivals of soybean on the spot markets. Also, only 40% of the total crushing capacity in the country is being used due to pricing disparity.
Last year, 33 million tonnes of edible oil was crushed domestically.
The disparity in crushing currently stands at $40 to $50 per tonne which is not viable for a crusher. Also, the margins have dipped and is almost negligible for the last two years which has had a negative impact.
“Due to farmers not bringing stocks to the market and also due to disparity and lower global prices of edible oil, edible oil crushing industry is being negatively impacted. There is a glut of edible oil globally due to which it is cheaper to import edible oil than crush oil seeds locally,” said Sandeep Bajoria, CEO of Sunvin Group.
Edible oil imports have constantly been hitting new highs as domestic consumption is constantly rising coupled with cheaper international rates of edible oil. Crude palm oil is currently being imported at $650 per tonne and crude soybean oil is being imported at $840 per tonne. Indian prices of RBD palm oil price on Kandla port is currently at Rs 55,000 per tonne.
Last oil year, edible oil imports stood at 11.8 million tonnes, which was record imports and this year it is expected to go up to 12.3 million tonnes, which will also be at an all time high. Domestic consumption of edible oil is rising two to three% every year.
“This year, around 700,000 tonnes – 700,500 tonnes of soy bean is expected to be crushed compared to 1.1 million tonnes -1.2 million tonnes last year. This year, crushing has been impacted in quite adversely. Usually this time of the year, around 60% of edible seeds is crushed but this year it is lower,” said Atul Chaturvedi, CEO of Adani Wilmar.
The sector has asked the government raise the import duty on crude palm oil to make the refining and fats business viable. Owing to a five% difference between crude and refined oil, the edible oil business has suffered immensely. Since the edible oil crushing and refining business offers disparity, large players are focusing on value-added segment, where business potential is quite high.
Solvent Extractors' Association of India has asked the government to raise import duty on crude vegetable oil to 5% from 2.5% currently and refined oil to 15% from 7.5%.

Israels elections and the international isolation themeBy Eugene Kontorovich December 11, 2014
In today’s  Israel Hayom, I have a piece about how the motif of “Israel’s international isolation” will be used in the country’s current election season. Here is an excerpt :
The campaign against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will focus on his alleged “isolation” of Israel from the rest of the “international community” through his diplomatic policies….
Perhaps the aspect of isolation most feared by Israelis is economic. Yet here there is simply no evidence for any isolation. Israel’s trade has risen steadily with all its major partners, even those most critical of it, like Europe. Moreover, Netanyahu has opened new doors to opportunities in India and elsewhere in Asia. Just like his ideological tension with European leaders has not impeded trade, one should not credit his compatibility with the nationalist leadership of India for these new frontiers. Rather, business has a life of its own that — except in the most extreme cases — is separate from diplomacy.
Then there is the issue of European parliaments passing nonbinding suggestions to recognize a Palestinian state. The Left can hardly blame the government for these, when some of the leading figures on the left have been lobbying European capitals to pass such measures. Indeed, major Labor Party figures — including former attorney-generals, speakers of parliament, and so forth — have been at the forefront of the Palestinian recognition campaign. They have not been drummed out of the party, or otherwise significantly rebuked. So if anything, it is not Netanyahu but his critics who should shoulder the blame for this (rather insignificant) diplomatic disturbance.
It may be surprising to Netanyahu’s critics, who see Jewish homes in Judea and Samaria as the source of all Israel’s problems, but the one of the major reasons cited in European parliaments for passing Palestinian recognition motions has to do with an area of Eretz Israel where no Jews live — Gaza. Parliamentarians have repeatedly stressed that the timing of these resolutions — during a freeze on new construction plans — is motivated in large part by what they perceived as the brutality of this summer’s Gaza War. Of course, that campaign was supported across the [Israeli] political spectrum.
And of course a left-leaning government is hardly a guarantee against international pressure. For example, the Goldstone commission report on the Gaza War — the modern blueprint for delegitimizing Israel — was concocted during Tzipi Livni’s Foreign Ministry. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which is thus far a nuisance at best, will not slow its activities based on who holds the prime ministry. The International Court of Justice’s opinion on the security fence — the high point of anti-Israeli legal campaigns — was released a month after the government approved the Gaza disengagement.

RBI to review priority sector lending norms for foreign banksRBI reviewing priority lending norms for foreign banks

Will nudge them to convert Indian branches into wholly-owned subsidiaries: Rajan
Kolkata, December 10:  
The Reserve Bank of India is reviewing the priority sector lending norms for foreign banks; after which it will “nudge” them to convert their Indian branches into wholly-owned subsidiaries, Governor Raghuram Rajan said here on Thursday.
According to him, foreign banks have expressed their concerns and obligations (to the central bank and the Government) that they will have if they convert their branches into wholly-owned subsidiaries.
The primary concerns raised by these foreign banks relate to priority sector lending, which mandates that the banks lend to certain special sectors such as agriculture, small scale industries and education.
Rajan told reporters that once the norms are revised, the RBI will “nudge the foreign banks into adopting those structures.”
According to Rajan, new foreign banks, which are entering the country will fall under the wholly-owned subsidiary scheme framework.
Foreign banks that entered India after August 2010 will have to convert their branches into wholly-owned subsidiaries. The conversion is however, voluntary for those who have been operating in the country before this cut-off period.
New structure
“Those who are entering India will be coming under the structure; there is no issue with that. It was for those whom it was voluntary that we are trying to give an incentive to move into that structure by detailing the priority sector norms,” he said, and added that the bank was worried about systemic risks arising out of large foreign banks in India. Hence, the RBI had to be explicit about the costs and benefits of their moving into the new structure. “Otherwise it would be retrospective regulation, which we would not want to do,” he said.
However, if existing foreign banks apply for branch licences, the RBI will continue to grant the same. “We haven’t stopped giving branch licences,” Rajan said.
Steps in terms of introducing universal banking licences on tap basis will be taken after the RBI goes ahead with the licences for small and payments banks.
“We will re-examine the criteria we had for the universal banks and then come to a decision on reframing them. And then we will open the window at that point,” he said.

Wal-Mart report found inflated profit  unapproved sales in China0
"None of the financial issues we've reviewed in China were determined to be material to Wal-Mart's consolidated financial condition or results of operations," the statement said. Wal- Mart didn't didn't address specific questions on accounting issues, and leadership changes. It said bulk sales to retailers are common practice in developing markets, monitored regularly, and a modest part of its Chinese business.
Four top managers of Wal-Mart China left the company in 2011, including Ed Chan, then chief executive officer for the country. Chan, now vice chairman of C.P. Lotus Corp., a retailer based in Hong Kong, said the reason he left was known only to him and Wal-Mart and was unrelated to price markups or bulk purchases. At the time, Wal-Mart said he left for personal reasons.
The bulk sales provided at least 1.6 billion yuan ($243 million dollars) in sales, and the markups accounted for 4 percent of gross profits in 2010 alone at 98 hypermarket stores examined by Stanford Lin, who conducted the internal review. These stores accounted for about half of total hypermarket sales in China that year.
At the time, Wal-Mart was looking to growth abroad to make up for a slowdown in the U.S.
"There is a general flexibility on ethics" in China, Lin said in an interview. "There was a huge desire to perform. In this market, they believe if they're hitting the numbers, then they're doing the right thing."
Lin left Wal-Mart last year, and became head of Chinese operations for Visa Inc. in Shanghai.
By 2010, the year of Lin's review, the United States was just emerging from recession. While Wal-Mart's Chinese operations were expanding, the stores weren't running as profitably as those operated in the U.S. by the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer.
As a newly minted member of Wal-Mart's Strategy and Innovation Team, Lin, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant, was assigned to look for ways to improve productivity. What he found was a Chinese operation veering out of control.
Lin traveled across the country asking workers in the hypermarkets — vast, we-sell-it-all arcades roughly equivalent to Wal-Mart's core superstores in the U.S. — what kind of activity was wasting their time. Markups, they told him: hours spent putting higher prices on thousands of goods — from DVD players to vintage liquor. Managers often told employees to raise prices in the last week of the month, and to move them down at the start of the next month.
The employees couldn't understand why. Higher prices, even if temporary, didn't jibe with the everyday-low-pricing strategy that founder Sam Walton and his successors used to turn his Arkansas five-and-dime into the world's biggest retail chain, with more than $480 billion in annual sales.
The markups were part of a pattern of "unusual," unauthorized, and "unsustainable," accounting moves and deals with suppliers and rivals that made sales and profits look stronger than the underlying retail trends in the stores, according to Lin's 32-page review, labeled "Highly Confidential."
"The business was continually getting worse despite their pronouncements to the contrary," Lin said earlier this year.
The February 2011 review and interviews with current and former Wal-Mart employees raise questions about how the company has booked results in the world's second-biggest economy. They also cast new light on Wal-Mart's degree of success in China — which the company called a standout in the period Lin covered.
China "drove the strong sales performance" of the international division, Wal-Mart told investors in May 2010. Eight days after Lin's written review, Wal-Mart said in a conference call that China was among countries with the highest sales increases in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2011.
Now, it is one of the weaker links. Net sales fell in China in the company's fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31, which it said was "due to retail deflationary pressure." The company has said it will close about 30 of roughly 400 Chinese stores, and on Dec. 2 it said it is shedding 250 jobs in China, mostly in merchandising and marketing.
There will be 6,000 new jobs created with the opening of nine new stores and a distribution center this month, the company has said.
The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating Wal-Mart for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the company has disclosed. Internal investigations of possible misconduct are open in four countries, including China, the company has said.
It isn't known whether the practices described in Lin's report are part of the inquiries under the act, which has a section on the integrity of books and records. The company has said it is cooperating with investigators. Wal-Mart declined to comment on the inquiry.
Altering reported income by marking up inventory "only to turn around and mark it down again" after the end of the quarter "would be fraud," said Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for the SEC and now a managing director at LitiNomics Inc., an advisory firm in Los Angeles. Turner was speaking generally, and not about Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart entered China in 1996. After opening 56 stores in its first 10 years, the company hired Chan as CEO in 2006. Educated in the U.S., and formerly with McKinsey, he was familiar with American business practices, and driven to enlarge the retailer's footprint in China, colleagues said.
By 2008, the store count hit 200 and China had become a profitable market. In 2009 Forbes China named Chan among its "People of the Year."
Chan operated under the company's "freedom within a framework" policy that allowed executives to run their own areas without interference, according to those who worked for him. He allowed his deputies to handle the day-to-day running of the business while keeping them focused on meeting profit goals, which helped decide raises and promotions, they said.
Chan had been the boss in China for two years when Doug McMillon, now Wal-Mart's chief executive officer, became head of international operations. An Arkansas native, McMillon rose through the ranks from a store level-job to merchandising posts and a stint running the Sam's Club warehouse division. Within three months of taking over international, McMillon told investors that it needed to be more productive.
Lin, fluent in English and Mandarin, and schooled in the U.S. like Chan, said he was hired to root out inefficiency and reduce head counts. The time spent on markups quickly caught his attention.

`Defence Ministry okays to release 5 Mhz of 3G spectrum`Defence Ministry okays to release 5 Mhz of 3G spectrum’

New Delhi, Dec 11:  
Defence Ministry has agreed to free some of its spectrum for use by mobile phone companies, a move that will boost upcoming auction of radiowaves.
The Ministry has “in—principle” agreed to release 5 megahertz (Mhz) in the 2,100 Mhz band across in 17 out of 22 telecom services areas or circles, said a top source.
This is one—fourth of the quantity that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has been seeking.
The additional spectrum will be available by March or April, said the source.
“We expect 5 Mhz in 2100 Mhz band to be vacated by the Defence. The rest 15 Mhz, which is to be swapped with other bands, mainly 1900 Mhz, will also happen but it will take time,” the source said.
The spectrum vacation will require the Cabinet approval, sources said, indicating that the government may go ahead with 3G auction with 5 Mhz in the next round to be held in February.
The Department of Telecom is in discussions with the Defence on the issue, they added.
In 2010, three blocks each having 5 Mhz frequency of 3G spectrum were auctioned across the country and fetched Rs 67,718.95 crore to the exchequer.
Defence had released 20 Mhz out of 25 Mhz in 2100 Mhz band allocated to DoT under the agreement with Defence on a pan—India basis and one more block of 5 Mhz in 5 circles, which was auctioned in 2010.
Under the agreement with DoT, the remaining spectrum is to be vacated only after the alternate communications network is completed.
The government plans to conduct 3G spectrum auction along with 2G radiowaves sale in February. It has asked telecom regulator TRAI to expedite the base price recommendations for that.

Russia  Brazil could bounce back strongly i...Banco Bradesco
(Russia and Brazil could…)
LONDON: Russia and Brazil could experience swift economic recoveries with the help of government policy changes, though the threat of more sanctions against Moscow was still present, veteran fund manager Mark Mobius said on Thursday.
Gas and oil account for two thirds of Russia's exports and the country has been hit hard by a 40 per cent drop in oil prices as well as sanctions imposed by western powers over the Ukraine crisis.
In Brazil the narrow re-election of President Dilma Rousseff in October rattled markets doubting her ability to curb the budget deficit and control inflation.
"We believe both Russia and Brazil have the resources to bounce back strongly should more appropriate policies be adopted," wrote Mobius in his Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust 2015 outlook.
"With Russia in particular, much risk already has been discounted in exceptionally low equity valuations as of December-end, though the Russian government's unwillingness to soften its stance toward Ukraine could elicit more sanctions that result in a negative environment for investors."
Mobius manages more than $3 billion in his flagship emerging markets equity fund, which counts Brazilian banks Itau Unibanco and Banco Bradesco among its top five holdings.
Mobius predicted ongoing reforms in many countries were set to boost economic growth across global emerging markets at comfortably higher rates than that of their developed peers.
Investors also failed to recognise the favourable trends in emerging markets equity valuations, which were well below those of their developed market peers, he added.
"Even after recent rallies in some emerging markets, they continued to appear relatively attractive to us in relation to history, particularly if very low bond yields and interest rates for savers are taken into account."

India concerned over certain agri imports from east of IndiaIndia concerned over certain agri imports from east of India
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 07:50 PM IST
India today expressed concerns over imports of pepper from south-east Asian countries saying the inbound shipments could impact small farmers of southern states.
Addressing the members and business delegates of CLMV (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam) countries, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said farmers of the Southern states of India have raised concerns over imports of certain agriculture produce, which are grown in these states like spices, from these overseas countries.
"There are voices of anxiety that if there are other than legitimate trade coming in, may be some where some kind of a rules/country of origin of rules being bypassed. Products coming through different countries," she said.
Citing example of pepper imports, Sitharaman said Kerala has expressed a lot of concerns about pepper which comes into this country from Vietnam "which they are willing to accept but if there are pepper coming from countries which do not grow pepper at all, they (Kerala producers) are worried as to where this pepper comes from".
CLMV (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam) countries are also members of Asean (Association of South East Asian Nations) group. India has implemented a free trade agreement with the 10-nations ASEAN bloc.
"I have provinces within India, particularly the southern provinces, which probably climatically have lot of commonness with these four countries (CLMV), were already expressing concern about agricultural products which are very unique to us also coming in a very big way into India and as producers particularly the small producers find it difficult to compete," Sitharaman said.
Farmer's associations had criticised the Centre for signing the FTA with Asean. The trade pact came into force in 2010. The import duties have been reduced from 70 per cent to 60 per cent. It would be further reduced to 50 per cent by 2019.
Pepper imports in India increased from 16,100 tonnes in 2010-11 to 17,565 tonnes in 2011-12. It was 15,600 tonnes in 2012-13 and 15,680 tonnes in 2013-14.
"And these are issues which can rankle and therefore in engaging with particularly CLMV, I would certainly want greater trust and confidence in talking about not just manufactured goods but also about agri products in which some states in India always have the lead advantage," she added.

RBI to nudge foreign banks for subsidiarisation post review of PSL normsRBI to nudge foreign banks for subsidiarisation post review of PSL norms
BS Reporter | Kolkata Dec 12, 2014 12:23 AM IST
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will nudge foreign banks in the country to opt for the subsidiarisation route after it reviews the priority sector lending (PSL) norms set for them.
“Foreign banks expressed to us some concerns on the kind of obligations they would have if they move into the wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS) structure... We are in the process, at the request of the ministry, of reviewing the priority sector norms. When that process is finished after consultation with the government, we will be able to communicate those norms. Once we do that, we can nudge the foreign banks to move into the wholly-owned structure,” RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said post the central bank’s board meeting in Kolkata on Thursday.
The central bank’s initial efforts to convince foreign lenders to create subsidiaries in India had failed.
After taking feedback from bankers, RBI in November last year released a new framework for setting up WOS by foreign banks in India. It promised foreign lenders “near-national” treatment in branch expansion and permission to acquire local private banks if they choose to create subsidiaries here. Capital gains tax and tax duty have also been waived for conversion of foreign banks’ India branches into WOS.
Many of them believe that they do not have the required expertise and risk management framework to meet stiff PSL targets. RBI had said the PSL requirement for WOS of foreign banks will be 40 per cent, just like their Indian rivals. Out of this, 18 per cent of loans have to be offered to the farm sector.
While RBI has not made the WOS structure mandatory for existing foreign banks (which commenced banking business in India before August, 2010), it said foreign lenders that do not provide adequate disclosure in their home jurisdiction, have complex structures or are not widely held will have to set up subsidiaries in India. Also, foreign banks that entered India after August, 2010 will have to mandatorily convert their branches into WOS.
Rajan clarified new foreign banks that are entering India now will have to set up WOS. Also, RBI will continue to allow branch expansion of existing foreign banks.
“Ultimately, we are worried about systemic risks stemming from large foreign banks in India. Many of those have been in India for many years. We have to be explicit about the costs and benefits. Otherwise, it will be a retrospective regulation...If they apply (for branch licence), it goes through normal process. We have not stopped giving branch licences,” he said. Separately, the governor said while current account deficit has widened it still remains at a comfortable level.
“Current account deficit (at 2.1 per cent of gross domestic product) is still comfortable. The direction is something that we will be watching closely. There are risks to the current account. (But) at this point, while we are certainly vigilant, but I won't say we are apprehensive,” Rajan said.
He added that the fall in global oil prices has provided a cushion to the current account and persuaded RBI to experiment with liberalising restrictions on gold imports.
"It will be hard to maintain the kind of restrictions that we had for a long period. At some point we have to start taking off some of the restrictions. The oil prices are falling. It gives us some cushion on the current account. It is a good time to see what happens if we take off the restrictions (on gold imports)," Rajan said.

(The number of Americans…)
WASHINGTON: The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, pointing to a strengthening labor market.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 for the week ended Dec. 6, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The prior week's data was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 295,000 last week.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, ticked up by 250 to 299,250, holding below the 300,000 mark for the 13th straight month.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data. There is little doubt that the labor market is gathering steam.
Job gains in November were the largest in nearly three years and marked the 10th straight month of increases above 200,000, the longest such stretch since 1994.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased by 142,000 to 2.51 million in the week ended Nov. 29.

Chetan Bhagat offers lifelong friendship to miffed Bihar royalsThreatened with a defamation suit for his "unflattering references" to Bihar's royal family of Dumraon in his book 'Half Girlfriend', best-selling author Chetan Bhagat has extended sent an olive branch to the aggrieved party.

Bhagat has extended “an offer of lifelong friendship” to Maharaj Bahadur Kamal Singh and ‘Yuvraj’ Chandra Vijay Singh of the erstwhile princely state of Dumraon in Bihar’s Buxar district.
This was in response to a legal notice sent to him on November 14, seeking an unconditional public apology from Bhagat and the publisher of his book, Rupa Publications, for the description of the royal family as ‘gamblers and alcoholics’ in Half Girlfriend.
Through the notice, sent by Supreme Court lawyer Gaurav Ghosh, the family had also sought the expunging of the words "Royal Family of Dumraon" and other references to the erstwhile rulers from all copies that may be published in the future.
Expressing his sincere regret, Bhagat has urged the royal family to consider making him “an honorary resident” of Dumraon.
“I cannot compel you to do so, but if you do, it will mean a lot to me and I will share this generous act of yours with the world,” the author stated in his ‘emotionally charged’ communication.
“I set the book in Bihar to promote Bihar, to make people more curious about the state... in some ways we have the same goal... more glory for Dumraon. We should not be adversaries, we should be friends,” Bhagat stated.
“This is not something we need to discuss in public, or in courts, please let me know and we can talk this over."
“This sounds like an offer for an out of court settlement. But the letter is frivolous and does not answer our substantive concerns pertaining to our honour and dignity,” the Dumaraon Maharaja’s grandson Shivang Vijay Singh told HT on Thursday.
In a second legal notice sent on behalf of the royal family on December 8, lawyer Gaurav Ghosh described Bhagat’s submissions as “meaningless” and reiterated the royals’ demand to initiate proceedings if Bhagat failed to address their concerns.
Bhagat had recently posted on Twitter: “Meanwhile have to write a letter to the family in Dumraon explaining the meaning of fiction and imaginary stories. Will do so privately”.
Describing this as representative of Bhagat’s ‘Janus-faced’ approach, the second called his offer of friendship as “unscrupulous” and hence rejected. It seeks compliance of demand raised through the earlier November 14 notice.
It also calls upon Bhagat and Rupa Publications to desist from promoting ‘Half Girlfriend’, failing which the royal family would be constrained to seek damages and initiate criminal proceedings against the two "addressees".

Blame oil! The stock market is down 2.4% from its high this year – and certainly energy stocks are a big reason — but not the only one.
There are six stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 that are down 8% or more since the market’s Dec. 5, 2014 peak that aren’t in the energy sector, including game seller GameStop (GME) , casino Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and fast-food chain Yum! Brands (YUM) .
Investors might be tempted to assume the market’s troubles are due to  plunging energy prices. And there’s no question seeing energy giant Exxon Mobil (XOM) fall nearly 6% is a big drag to overcome. But some stocks can’t easily point to oil prices as the reason for their troubles.
GameStop is a great example. The company has all sorts of problems, but falling oil prices aren’t among them. The seller of video games has seen its stock fall nearly 11% since Dec. 5 as consumers increasingly download games rather than visit the mall. Revenue during the quarter ended in November fell nearly 1% and net income dropped nearly 18%.
And over at casino operator Wynn, again, the blame isn’t pointed at energy for the stock’s 10% drop since Dec. 5. The casino operator has made a big bet on gaming in the Asian casino mecca of Macau. That bet isn’t looking great as the economy in China slows.
To be fair, there is somewhat of a direct hit on some companies that aren’t in the energy sector. First Solar (FSLR) , maker of solar equipment, is a great example. Shares are down nearly 6% in part due the fact that cheaper oil makes solar a less viable alternative. Shares of First Solar are down 8% since Dec. 5 as investors get nervous about the demand for solar gear if oil prices don’t rebound.
The bottom line? It’s easy to look past market losses saying it’s just because oil prices are falling and dragging down the market. There are some cases where there’s another very real scapegoat.
S&P 500 STOCKS DOWN THE MOST SINCE THE DEC. 5, 2014 PEAK – THAT AREN’T IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

No web-based taxi service has license to operate in Andhra Pradesh:GovtBy: Press Trust of India | Hyderabad |
Posted: December 11, 2014 9:00 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 9:03 pm
In the wake of rape of a woman passenger by allegedly by a cabbie contracted by the US-based Uber, Andhra Pradesh government on Thursday said no web-based taxi service can operate in the state as it had not given a license to any such operator.
“Government of Andhra Pradesh has not given licence to any web-based taxi service,” transport commissioner G Anantha Ramu said.
An advisory from the Centre to the states had said the authorities should ensure that operation of such services were stopped and the people may be advised not to hire any transport service provided by the web-based companies which are not licenced, he said.
“Hence, all the web-based taxi service providers which are not licenced are banned in AP,” Ramu said.
The officials at the district level had been directed to conduct regular inspections to find out if taxis operating in their area were violating the Motor Vehicle Act and Motor Vehicle Rules, he said.
People should not hire a taxi from any such web-based companies which are not licenced by the government, the transport commissioner added.
Telangana transport department has already announced that Uber has no permission to operate in the state, and passengers should stay away from it and cab drivers should not be associated with it.

Will not back India during Indo-Pak cricket match:MalalaBy: Press Trust of India | Oslo |
Posted: December 11, 2014 8:52 pm | Updated: December 11, 2014 9:29 pm
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai is ready to consider co-winner Kailash Satyarthi as her ‘father’ but when arch-rivals Pakistan and India face-off on the cricket ground, she is very clear whom to support.
“Only thing in which I do not support India is cricket match, other than that I am totally with India,” 17-year-old Malala, said during an event here in the Norwegian capital.
Describing Malala, was shot in the head and nearly killed by the Taliban in 2012 for fighting for the rights of girls to education, as his daughter, Satyarthi, 60, had said she was the bravest child one can think of.
In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Satyarthi had said that unprecedented violence could be suicidal for humankind.
“Yet, young people like Malala, are rising up everywhere and choosing peace over violence, tolerance over extremism, and courage over fear.”
In her acceptance speech, Malala said, “I am honoured to receive this award together with Kailash Satyarthi, who has been a champion of children’s rights for a long time. Twice as long, in fact, than I have been alive. I am also glad that we can stand together and show the world that an Indian and a Pakistani can be united in peace and together work for children’s rights.”
Malala, the youngest Nobel laureate ever, today called on Norway’s woman Prime Minister Erna Solberg, a day after she and Satyarthi were presented the prestigious award.
During a press conference after her meeting, Malala saidshe could see herself becoming Pakistan prime minister in about 20 years.
“I want to help my country, I want my country to go forward and I’m really patriotic,” she said.
“That’s why I decided that I’d join politics and maybe one day people will vote for me and I get the majority, I’ll become the prime minister,” she said when asked about her future, including her political ambitions.
Malala said Benazir Bhutto, the former Pakistan prime minister, who was assassinated by terrorists in 2007 was her inspiration.
“She is an example … giving this message that women can go forward because in some communities women are not supposed to go forward and become a prime minister,” Malala said.

New Delhi: Uber cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, who is accused of raping a 25-year-old woman, on Thursday admitted to have sexually assaulted many women, said sources.

A Delhi court had sent the accused into a judicial custody till December 24 after being produced by the police on Thursday evening.

The Uber Cabs has suspended all its services in New Delhi with effect from Thursday. Meanwhile, the company's Asia-Pacific head was grilled by the Delhi Police on Wednesday. He was asked to furnish documents on employee verification, the company's database, and documents pertaining to employees they hire.
A petition was filed in the Delhi High Court over Uber not having a grievance officer, which is mandatory for all cab companies.
The police also recovered the iPhone that was given to the accused driver by Uber. Delhi Police has filed an FIR against Uber for cheating and not following government orders.
Justice Usha Mehra, a member of Justice JS Verma panel on rape law, however, said none of the guidelines given by the panel have been implemented by the government. The panel was set up after horrific December 16 Delhi gangrape to identify lapses and fix responsibility.
Mehra said, "Nothing has changed since Nirbhaya case. The government hasn't followed any of our recommendations. Uber and the Transport Department are equally responsible. The coordination between traffic police and the transport Department is still lacking."

Walgreen CEO Wasson to step downWalgreen CEO Wasson to step down

New leadership on the way for Walgreen
Walgreen CEO will retire after Alliance Boots deal closes
Walgreen CEO departure comes as no surprise to investors
Walgreen CEO Greg Wasson will step down after the company completes its acquisition of European counterpart Alliance Boots, the company said Wednesday, a decision that didn't surprise company observers and investors.
Chairman James Skinner will become executive chairman of the combined company, Walgreens Boots Alliance. Stefano Pessina, Italian-born nuclear engineer turned drugstore mogul and the executive chairman of Alliance Boots, will serve as acting CEO of the new company, pending a board search for a successor.
Walgreen shareholders are set to vote on the $15.3 billion second step of the purchase of Alliance Boots on Dec. 29. Walgreen expects the deal to close by the end of March.
The pending change caps a tumultuous year for Walgreen, which in August backed off a controversial plan to move its headquarters abroad in an effort to save on taxes. Shares, too, were battered that month after Walgreen revised its 2016 profit targets lower by $2 billion.
After hitting a 2014 high of $76.08 in June, shares have slowly regained ground from the August announcement, closing Wednesday at $68.15. Walgreen stock was up 5.09 percent, or $3.47, in midmorning trading Thursday.
Wasson's departure comes amid reports of Pessina's growing influence in the company that have circulated for months.
"Pessina is pretty much the leader of the company for the most part," said Morningstar senior analyst Vishnu Lekraj.

Pessina joined Walgreen's board in 2012, when Walgreen agreed to buy a 45 percent stake in Alliance Boots, a large European drugstore chain. The deal gave him 7.6 percent of the company's stock.
Since then, Walgreen shareholders encouraged the company to move forward with a corporate tax inversion, which would have moved the company's tax domicile to the United Kingdom and lowered the company's tax rate. But in early August Walgreen said it would keep its headquarters in the Chicago area. At the same time, as a sign of Pessina's influence, several Alliance Boots executives were named to fill out the combined company's management.
"So much of what happens in the boardroom has less to do with operating results than trust and confidence in the CEO," said Michael Levin, an activist investor based in Chicago. "You have to think that the guy from Boots (Pessina) doesn't trust Wasson to execute on the plan properly."
The announcement of Wasson's departure could also mean that the possibility of a corporate tax inversion is back on the table.
"The opportunity for Walgreen to execute an inversion could be reviewed and they could potentially go ahead and do that given that there's a new leadership team and a lot of that leadership team is based out of Europe," Lekraj said.
Wasson joined Walgreens in 1980 as a pharmacy intern while studying at Purdue University's School of Pharmacy. He managed pharmacies in Houston and became regional vice president of store operations.
He took on several executive roles in the Walgreens Health Initiatives division and was promoted to chief operating officer in 2007, a position that traditionally had served as the springboard for Walgreen CEOs-in-waiting. He was named CEO in 2009.
In a statement, Wasson said it was time for new leadership to move the company forward.
"When I became CEO six years ago, I had three goals — to transform the front end of Walgreens drugstores, to advance the role that community pharmacy plays in health care and to find the right partner to take Walgreens global," Wasson said.
But in July, Wasson told the Tribune that he expected to lead the combined company after the merger.
Wasson became CEO when the economy was in a historic downturn and Walgreen had just lost to rival CVS Caremark on a bid to buy a chain of more than 500 West Coast drugstores run by Longs Drug Stores Corp.
Walgreen stock was trading in the low-$20 range, when it had been up to slightly more than $50 two years earlier.
Wasson focused on leveraging the key real estate properties and launched a rebranding campaign that revamped the look and feel of its stores, expanded health care services and enhanced cosmetics counters and fresh food offerings.
He moved regional vice presidents from headquarters offices and into their regions to shift some of the decision-making into the hands of those closest to the business.
Wasson also zoned in on the store's retail pharmacy challenges, from rising drug prices to mounting reimbursement pressures. He launched a blueprint to reinvent the company called the "Walgreens Plan to Win."
In 2010, Wasson spearheaded the acquisition of New York-based pharmacy chain Duane Reade for $1.1 billion and in 2012 he identified the opportunity to potentially acquire Alliance Boots, a deal that should close before the end of the first quarter.
As far as who will succeed him — that's harder to say, but the company could be looking to Europe.
"That's up for debate, it's still uncertain right now" Lekraj said.
Lekraj said the Alliance Boots operational team is viewed as being "very competent" within the investment community and noted that Walgreen is trying to increase its profitability on the front end of the store, where it sells grocery goods and other items.
"You may see someone with that type of background," he said.

The Budget Deal Is a Disasterreddit
It sounds like one of those fundraising emails Democratic groups kept sending out during the last election season, warning of imminent impeachment and other inflated threats: "Listen, I'm pleading." "CRUSHING blow." "Disaster." "Kiss all hope goodbye." "SHOCKING news."
It sounds like it, but it's not. We really have an emergency on our hands. This is not a drill.
The budget deal hammered out this week between Republican and Democratic negotiators literally imperils the economy. If it becomes law, our nation's biggest banks will once again have a green light to gamble on the derivatives which helped create the 2008 financial crisis. Congress is doing Wall Street's bidding with this budget, and it needs to be stopped.
Listen, I'm pleading.
More importantly, so is Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who spoke today about the proposed "cromnibus" deal (the name is a portmanteau of "continuing resolution" or "CR," and "omnibus"), calling it "a deal negotiated behind closed doors that ... would let derivatives traders on Wall Street gamble with taxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system ... "
"The provision that's about to be repealed requires banks to keep separate a key part of their risky Wall Street speculation so that there's no government insurance for that part of their business," Warren said, adding: "As the New York Times has explained, 'the goal was to isolate risky trading and to prevent government bailouts' - because these sorts of risky trades -- called 'derivatives' trades -- were 'a main culprit in the 2008 financial crisis.'
"The House of Representatives is about to show us the worst of government for the rich and powerful," Warren concluded. She's right. This partial repeal of Dodd-Frank is a giveaway to the five or six banks that remain too big to fail. It's also an invitation for them to engage in additional risky behavior.
We can't afford another financial crisis. Using very conservative methodology, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated the cost of the last crisis at between $6 trillion and $14 trillion. That comes to a minimum of $50,000, or as much as $120,000, for every single household in the country.
This deal shows us what can happen when government is put for sale to the highest bidder -- and that brings us to another one of its terrible provisions: The agreement increases the amount rich donors can give to political parties in each election cycle more than sevenfold, to $777,000 per person or more. As the New York Times reports , it also "(creates) new designated accounts to pay for presidential nominating conventions, legal fees and the cost of buying or renovating office space."
This would give billionaires even more influence over both major parties. In a mordantly amusing side note, the Times noted that "neither party's lawmakers would take responsibility for inserting the provision" into the deal.
And yet, there it is.
It shouldn't matter if you're a Democrat, a Republican, or an independent, whether you're on the left or the right. If you believe in democracy, you should oppose these provisions. And if you believe in the free market, you should oppose giving a few banks an unfair competitive advantage.
That's not all that's objectionable in this deal. Another provision would result in pension plan cuts for an estimated 1.5 million retirees. The IRS budget would be slashed, reducing enforcement on billionaires, corporations, and political groups claiming to be "educational" in nature.
The deal would also end the voter-approved legalization of marijuana in the nation's capital. That's too bad. While I haven't indulged in ages, trust me: folks there are gonna need it if this deal goes through.
(More details on the overall "cromnibus" deal can be found here .)
But wait, some timorous souls will say. Republicans might shut down the government if they don't get their way. Their opponents should respond to that threat with one voice: let them. Voters are weary of shutdowns and shutdown threats. Any party that commits such an unpopular and destructive act -- especially when it's for the sole purpose of helping big banks and billionaires -- will pay a steep price for it.
As I wrote yesterday, Wall Street is moving in for the kill , and so is the rest of corporate America. A quote in TheHill.com today, attributed to an unnamed "senior GOP Senate aide," reinforces that conclusion. "If liberal Democrats vote for this package," said the aide, "it shows that conservatives can use must-pass legislation to repeal the regulatory state."
In other words, victory on this deal will bolster corporate-state politicians into holding more "must-pass" legislation -- and therefore, government itself - hostage to their patrons' demands. These threats will become a tool for dismantling a century's worth of regulations -- on the environment, working conditions, public safety, and a host of other issues.
So, yes, this budget deal is "shocking news," and its passage would be a "crushing blow." Tell your representative and senators: It must be stopped, now.
The Campaign for America's Future has a petition calling on Congress to reject "any bill that rolls back Dodd-Frank and gives Wall Street a free pass." You are also urged to call your member of Congress to register your opposition: The main Capitol switchboard is 202-224-3121, or you can find your representatives via USA.gov.

New Delhi, December 11:  
Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Ananth Kumar, said six to seven fertiliser manufacturing facilities will boost domestic fertiliser production over the next five years at the annual Fertiliser Association of India conference here on Thursday.
The Minister said the boost in production would be achieved through a mixture of new units and revival of closed ones that will augment the country`s existing capacity.
Kumar assured the industry that the Government will clear fertiliser subsidy arrears within a month and also said the issues relating to the sector would be addressed at the earliest.
"For the last one decade, the country has not seen a new fertiliser plant but the Prime Minister has now told us that we should strictly follow the principle of ‘Make In India’. Accordingly we are going to start and revive at least 6-7 fertiliser plants in next 5 years in both public and private sectors," he said.
At present, about eight units of the State-owned Fertiliser Corporation of India Ltd and Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation are closed. The Ministry is working on reviving five of these closed plants.
It is also seeking increased supply of natural gas for urea manufacturing plants and has asked the Petroleum Ministry to explore the possibility of a gas pipeline from Phulpur to Haldia.

At least 12 people were injured Thursday after a clash broke out between activists of the student wings of the Trinamool Congress and the Congress at the Berhampore College in West Bengal's Murshidabad district, police said.
AAccording to police, members of Congress' Chattra Parishad and the Trinamool Congress Chatra Parishad clashed with dozens of activists attacking each others with batons and bamboo sticks.
"At least 12 people, mostly students, have been hospitalised with injuries. Adequate number of police personnel have been posted at the college," said a police officer.
The condition of two of the injured admitted to the Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital is said to be serious.
The rival student outfits have clashed earlier in September in which two students were injured.
While a heavy deployment of police personnel has been now made at the campus, college authorities accused to police of coming late to the scene despite repeated distress calls.

Accepts traders' request as existing position limits are impacting the liquidity
Mumbai, December 11:  
In a bid to increase liquidity, the commodity markets regulator Forward Markets Commission has raised the open interest limit for 18 commodities. Open interest is the number of contracts or commitments outstanding in futures trading on an official exchange at any one given time.
There were numerous representations from hedgers and value chain participants that the existing position limits are small and affecting liquidity and depth of the market, said FMC in a statement.
Adequate position limits will bring wider participation and improve the quality of price discovery.
The existing trading volumes and participation on the commodity exchanges are far short of its true potential as India figures in the top five rankings globally in terms of production and consumption of various agricultural commodities, it said.
The client level open position limit in rapeseed/mustard seed was doubled to 30,000 tonnes and soyabean to 60,000 tonnes, respectively.
The limit for refined soya oil was raised to 35,000 tonnes from 25,000 tonnes.
In castorseed, it moved up to 12,000 tonnes from 8,000 tonnes and in cotton it was marked up to 150,000 bales from 65,000 bales.
Limit was also raised for chana, cotton seed oil cake, crude palm oil, dhaniya, jeera and mentha oil.
In metal space, gold, aluminium and copper open interest was raise to 5 tonnes (3 tonnes), 25,000 tonnes (15,000 tonnes) and 7,000 tonnes (5,000 tonnes), respectively.
Limits were also enhanced in nickel, zinc and silver.

India Is On The Verge Of A Tech  Gold RushEmail
Comment
The technology industry's new Bay Area hub may be pretty far from San Francisco. The Bay of Bengal is shaping up to be the next hot startup market.
Highly skilled Indian tech workers -- some unable to get U.S. work visas -- are returning home from the United States or leaving Indian divisions of U.S. tech companies, eager to build their own companies in India. The country surpassed Japan as the world’s third-largest economy by a key measure this year.
India is now home to the four cities with the most tech workers on LinkedIn, according to a user study published in June by the career-focused social network. Bangalore -- commonly known as the Silicon Valley of India -- leads the way, followed by Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai.
In fifth place is the San Francisco Bay Area, home to the original Silicon Valley.
Last year, India pulled in $1.8 billion in venture funding, according to a recent report from Ernst & Young -- three times more than it brought in in 2006. Venture capitalists invested an estimated $1.26 billion in Indian companies in the first six months of this year alone, according to the startup industry site Your Story .
It’s still not equal to China, which attracted $3.5 billion in 2013. And the U.S. continues to pull in gobs of VC funding -- $33 billion last year, according to E&Y. However, strong signs point to growth for India, as more and more of the country’s 1.2 billion citizens move online. About a quarter of the population is now connected, according to the Internet and Mobile Association of India. The country is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world’s second-largest Internet market this month, the trade group said in a recent release .
“The Internet in India took more than a decade to move from 10 million to 100 million and three years from 100 million to 200 million,” the Internet and Mobile Association said in a statement to The Hindu, an English-language daily newspaper. “However, it took only a year to move from 200 to 300 million users. Clearly, Internet is mainstream in India today.”
At the same time, India’s middle class is growing. About 50 million people, or 5 percent of the population, now earn middle-class incomes, according to E&Y . That number is expected to grow to 200 million by 2020.
Internet access and a growing middle class mean more Indians are now shopping online. “E-commerce is the low-hanging fruit,” Vivek Wadhwa, an Indian-American entrepreneur and frequent tech industry pundit, told The Huffington Post. “It’s where the biggest opportunities are.”
India, which comprises the lightest gray on this chart from E&Y's 2014 report on global venture capital, pulled in $1.8 billion in VC money last year.
Currently, India’s e-commerce market generates about $2 billion in sales a year. That’s small compared to China’s annual Internet sales of about $300 billion , or the $260 billion spent in the U.S. last year.
But by 2020, India’s online retail sales could reach $30 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal .
Flipkart, an e-commerce site founded seven years ago in Bangalore, raised $1 billion in July, the largest round of funding ever granted to an Indian company. Founder Sachin Bansal, who previously worked as a senior software engineer at Amazon India, said in July that he aims to grow the company into a $100 billion behemoth in the next five years.
In October, rival Snapdeal, an online marketplace headquartered in New Delhi, sold a $627 million stake to Japanese business titan Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of media and telecom giant SoftBank. The investment kicked off SoftBank’s recently announced plan to invest about $10 billion into India’s e-commerce industry over the next decade.
American tech giants have taken notice. Last month, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos graced the cover of GQ India -- a space usually reserved for Bollywood stars -- following a $2 billion investment in his company’s India operations, announced a day after Flipkart’s $1 billion funding round.
Investment in e-commerce outpaced other sectors in the first six months of 2014, per this Your Story chart.
India also has a growing number of web startups. Founded by a former management consultant for New York-based Bain & Co., Zomato, a restaurant review index similar to Yelp, pulled in $60 million in funding last month, bringing its total valuation to $660 million. The popular chef social network Cucumbertown, co-founded by a former engineer at “Farmville” maker Zynga, launched a new feature called RecipeWriter in October in hopes of dominating India’s food-blogging niche. ZoomCar, a nascent car-sharing service targeting India’s bustling cities, raised $8 million in October in a funding round led by Sequoia Capital, the powerful Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm.
“Over the next three years, I see a gold rush happening, as you’re going to have a bunch of billion-dollar companies. Then everyone will be there,” Wadhwa said of India. “That’s how venture capitalists are -- they’re like sharks. They sense a drop of blood and they’re all over it.”
One expert noted that economic forces aren't the only thing at play in fueling the startup scene.
“There’s some cultural shift between generations -- the current generation of not only younger people, but 30-year-olds and 40-year-olds are more willing to take risk,” said Yossi Feinberg, an economics professor who heads Stanford University’s Ignite program, which for three years has allowed students in Bangalore to telecommute to lectures at the California college. “There's this idea of success in India that you have a family, a steady job, and now people are open to having experience in a startup where, even if it fails, it’s a valuable experience in the job market.”

Govtech bets that startups can solve government problems0
Canada native and serial entrepreneur Bouganim became a U.S. citizen in 2009, at which time he got “caught up in patriotism" and wanted to get involved in politics through technology. He volunteered with Code for America and went on to help launch the San Francisco-based nonprofit’s accelerator program in 2012.
Accelerator adviser Tim O’Reilly helped Bouganim launched the Govtech Fund and serves on its advisory board. All of Govtech Fund’s portfolio companies have gone through the Code for America accelerator.
Bouganim said startups historically struggled to sell to government, where purchase decisions often take a long time. Plus, many startups used newer technology like the cloud before government institutions were ready for it. 
But out-of-date government technology leads to waste and inefficiency, "not acceptable for an enterprise that is critical to society,” Bouganim said, and the two sides are finding ways to work together.
He envisions a future in which citizens’ interactions with government will be as easy as their experiences on the consumer Web. Bouganim says there’s no reason that sending in official forms should be any more difficult than using an app.
Cities are increasingly appointing chief data officers or chief information officers to make sense of which technologies are worth buying into, Bouganim said. He didn’t give specifics on which cities he thinks are tackling such innovation best. Chicago has had a chief information officer since December 2012. Brenna Berman took over the role in August 2013 after it was vacated by the city’s first CIO, Brett Goldstein.
Bouganim suggested state governments are three to five years behind city-level innovations and that the federal government is moving at an even slower pace. 
“I think it’s going to be a long innovation cycle,” Bouganim said. He said he expects to see returns and liquidity events in the 10 years the fund is open.
Govtech Fund invests in companies that have already sold into some government organizations, using that activity as proof of demand.
Bouganim said he’s looking for companies that can bring government to the cutting edge while not alienating workers and citizens with technology that may be too advanced for the average person.
“If you have a government experience that looks and feels like it could’ve in the ‘70s, that’s a good place for us to innovate,” Bouganim said.

2015 - The Year of the Message App for Consumers and Businessreddit
We are about to witness a massive leap in message apps for both consumers and the enterprise. 2015 will be the Year of the Message App. The sheer scale and reach of apps like WhatsApp, WeChat, Line, Kik and even FB Messenger is huge and not to be ignored. Message apps are often called "SMS+" and it's the + that's intriguing.
2014 proved to be a tipping point in what I call -- SMAC Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud. Each of these elements stands on it's own in providing value to both the enterprise and to consumers and together they've brought radical changes in how we communicate and work.
Social is pretty much fully integrated into the business and consumer mindset.
Everyone's on mobile and brands are figuring out how to market to mobile-first and mobile-only consumers as the shift speeds ahead.
Analytics (including big data)  is finally earning its keep and truly providing relevant insight to businesses and brands in a way that is meaningful and profitable.
The cloud provides the infrastructure to make it all happen.
But something has been missing. The ability to communicate one-to-one privately has been lost in the world of social applications. Many-to-many has a place and is relevant much of the time.
Message app appeal to the healthcare industry is interesting and something to watch. Tiger Text, the business messaging app that lets you delete messages after a set period of time, works with doctors and is now going after other industries in a big way.
From both a personal and a business standpoint, users want the ability to segment and choose who receives what message, when they receive it and how long it lives. Of course security is always a concern online. Look for 2015 to be a year in big innovations in this areas as providers and developers shore up the holes in a bid for wider adoption.
Brands and their agencies, along with enterprises are wise to keep their eye on these new apps to understand strengths and weaknesses. For instance, message apps pick up very little in the  way of user profiles - that's one of the appeals, but a potential downside to marketers. Knowing more can help your organization plan for the future.

How to Build a Holy Smart Cityreddit
Picture an ancient city full of intricately carved stone temples, where millions of pilgrims and ascetics come to bathe in the holy waters of the Ganges, as Hindus have done for hundreds of generations. Monks wearing saffron robes, or even nothing at all, who have dedicated their lives to simplicity and sacrificed comfort and materialism in search of a higher knowledge. Now, imagine that the holy water of the Ganges is being monitored by electronic sensors to detect pollution levels, the lights illuminating the streets and houses of this city are fitted with motion sensors and calibrated to save energy, and the amount of pilgrims visiting each day is fed through an algorithm to adjust train schedules and ensure that buses and trains are neither overcrowded nor empty. All of these connected to a central nervous system. A holy smart city.
This may seem crazy, but the idea is not so far from reality these days. Varanasi, India's holiest city located on the Ganges River, is part of an ambitious plan set forth by India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, to build 100 "smart cities." The list also includes Amritsar -- the historical and symbolic heart of Sikhism -- Agra -- the home of the Taj Mahal, as well as several completely new cities built from scratch. These cities will marry information technology with urban planning and infrastructure to create a data-driven model of city management in the hope of creating more efficient cities with better living conditions.
On his high profile tour full of public appearances and meetings with world leaders, Modi has been gathering support for this vision. In Tokyo, he initiated a partnership between Kyoto -- perhaps Japan's cultural capital -- and Varanasi. In Washington, Barack Obama accepted his offer "for U.S. Industry to be the lead partner to develop smart cities in Ajmer (Rajasthan), Visakhapatnam (Andra Pradesh), and Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh)."
"The spectacle of the sadhu with a smartphone aside, what does this mean? The Kumbh Mela itself is a microcosm of India: tradition collides with modernity, ritual and technology coexist, poverty and luxury are separated by a few yards."
This last city, Allahabad, particularly stands out to me as one of India's most sacred sites, at the intersection of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, and the location of the world's largest pilgrimage: the Kumbh Mela . Last year, I travelled to the Kumbh Mela as part of an interdisciplinary research team of students and professors from Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, Business School, Public Health School, and College of Arts and Science. We sought to analyze and document the pilgrimage as over 65 million people camped just outside Allahabad on the banks of the Ganges for just over a month, creating an entire pop-up city that for a few days became the world's largest city.
Some of us were scholars of religion and history, eager to see the rituals and the spectacle of the camps of Naga Babas -- ascetics who spend their years meditating and even eschew wearing clothes. Others, including myself, were interested in the economics, politics, and logistics of building a city to house tens of millions of pilgrims in just over a month. Our team included data scientists, intent on creating a "big data" archive to model how crowds of people interacted and moved around the city, landscape architects and environmentalists who analyzed soil and water samples to track pollution levels, and myself, an urban planner intent on cataloging and geotagging the thousands of digital photographs and videos our team compiled .
We were not alone: this was the first time in the centuries-long history of the Kumbh where smartphones were commonplace. Pilgrims, tourists and journalists posted their experience in real-time via blog entries, tweets, Instagrams and Facebook posts.
Even Google took notice, updating its satellite imagery with high-resolution views of the tents, pontoon bridges and modular street grid that captured this pop-up city as the planets aligned on the holiest day of the pilgrimage. In anticipation of the next Kumbh Mela, the MIT Media Lab and a coalition of startups are collaborating with Ratan Tata, one of India's most influential industrialists, to "identify 50 areas where technology can be used for solutions to probable challenges during the [next] Kumbh Mela."
The spectacle of the sadhu with a smartphone aside, what does this mean? The Kumbh Mela itself is a microcosm of India: tradition collides with modernity, ritual and technology coexist, poverty and luxury are separated by a few yards. A bureaucratic system and infrastructure that has remained fundamentally intact since India was the jewel of the British Empire struggles to cope with modern demands and an exponentially growing population (The Kumbh Mela still follows the same structure as it did in the early 20th century, when only a few hundred thousand pilgrims participated). Millions of Indians are migrating to cities that are already struggling to provide infrastructure and housing for existing residents. Water is a precious commodity, roads are clogged with cars, motorbikes and auto rickshaws, and hundreds of millions of people lack toilets.
Many experts agree with Modi and are hopeful that information technology and data-driven city management are a crucial component of meeting basic needs, ensuring more equitable and efficient distribution of resources and, in short, averting a crisis in overpopulated cities. While the organizers of the Kumbh Mela, to their credit, manage to execute the impossible task of building a city for 65 million people in a matter of months, even they will admit that corruption and carelessness waste millions of dollars and uncountable resources. As anybody who has grown up in or visited India can tell you, the same is true across the nation.
"Smart cities have the potential to transform India's cities, but unless the people who design them are sensitive to the reality that half a billion Indians are not even on the current grid, and almost a quarter of the country is illiterate, real change will not happen. "
These fundamental problems are embedded not just in infrastructure, but also in a social, economic and political environment of corruption and inequality. My work as an architect and urban planner in India has taught me that one of the biggest obstacles to housing is not the inability to design better, smaller, or more efficient buildings, but the political realities of land tenure and financing. That means smart cities may have the potential to create more efficient and adaptable ways to deliver services and manage cities, but unless they also address these underlying social and political problems, billions of dollars will be spent without addressing the fundamental problems that India's cities face.
One of the most efficient operations in the world -- admired widely and the subject of a Harvard Business School case study -- is Mumbai's network of dhabawallas. There are no high-tech sensors or sophisticated computer models involved. Millions of lunches packed in steel dhabas -- or lunch boxes -- are delivered each day using a system of basic symbols and the local knowledge of the delivery men, many of whom cannot even read or write. If one of Mumbai's most efficient and admired systems is a result of such low-tech ingenuity, we have to ask: will technology alone transform India's cities into efficient, sustainable settlements?
Successful solutions will marry technology with political savviness, a realistic assessment of citizens' needs to solve the problems at hand, and jugaad, a quintessential Hindi word for innovation with limited resources. One excellent example from a rural context is a network of solar powered "water ATMs" developed by an organization called Sarvajal. These ATMs serve over 100,000 customers in hard to reach places where nobody else  is willing to go into business, and in addition to dispensing water, they use mobile technology to monitor usage and track water quality in real time.
Other solutions are simple enough for citizens to maintain and operate themselves. On one trip to India, I stayed in a remote village where I woke up at the crack of dawn to help farmers gather cow dung in order to feed it into a biogas generator, a machine that uses an anaerobic process to convert organic material into energy for stoves and lamps. Some initiatives harness technology to create social change. An Indian anti-corruption organization created a website , www.ipaidabribe.com, as an online platform for users to post instances of petty corruption they face as part of daily life -- from buying a train ticket to acquiring a birth certificate.
We live in a world where data pervades almost every aspect of our lives. Furthermore, decentralized networks like Yelp and AirBnb are proving that decentralized, open source and peer-to-peer networks are much more robust and efficient than traditional centralized networks. Google and its peers have, of course, proven that information gives us the power to solve almost any problem imaginable, yet Edward Snowden has taught us the danger of unhindered data collection. Whenever possible, India's smart cities should recognize this reality and embrace the open-source mentality. Allowing academics, entrepreneurs and activists access to the big data generated by smart infrastructure will strengthen the smart cities initiative through accountability and innovative thinking.
Smart cities have the potential to transform India's cities, but unless the people who design them are sensitive to the reality that half a billion Indians are not even on the current grid, and almost a quarter of the country is illiterate , real change will not happen. Unless the engineering is combined with ingenuity to address fundamental political, social and economic weaknesses, smart cities will inevitably become another high profile megaproject; a false promise that does not realize its potential and becomes a burden, much like an empty Olympic stadium after games that promised much needed infrastructure and sustainable economic development.

States Block Key Tax Reform  Will Take up Demands With JaitleyArun Jaitley Resolves to Encourage Public, Private Investment in 2015
State finance ministers met Arun Jaitley today to push their demand on the Goods and Services Tax or GST.
In a setback to the BJP-led government at the centre, states have blocked a key reform, the Goods and Services Tax or GST, that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley hoped to build consensus on at a crucial meeting today.
"We have made some headway, will meet Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley again in a week's time," said Empowered Committee chairman after the meeting.
1) The government wants to roll out the GST by April 2016, but finance ministers of state governments today rejected several proposals of the Centre at the meeting in Delhi.
2) The GST is supposed to cut down the large number of taxes imposed by the central government and states, but states are not ready to let petroleum tax be subsumed in GST.
3) They have also rejected the central government's proposal offering three year compensation for any revenue loss on account of switching to the GST.
4) States want compensation for taxes forgone for five years.
5) They also want the government to pay dues towards central sales tax compensation pending from 2010-11 in one go. On Wednesday, Mr Jaitley had announced a proposal to pay Rs 11,000 crore as part payment of dues towards central sales tax compensation pending from 2010-11.
6) Also, there is no consensus on the final GST tax rates yet and recommendations vary from 16 per cent to 27 per cent.
7) The GST roll out has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over such crucial issues.
8) The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, has lapsed and the Modi government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
9) The government needs to take states on board because the GST Bill requires the consent of 50 per cent of states for implementation.
10) If successful, economists say the implementation of GST could add 2 percentage points to GDP growth.

Audi A3 Cabriolet launched in India  priced at Rs 44.75LMercedes- Benz posts record sales in India during 2014
German luxury car maker Audi plans to launch around 10 new models next year in India as it looks to further consolidate its position in the country.
The company, which today launched compact convertible Audi A3 Cabriolet in India priced at Rs 44.75 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), currently sells 17 models in the country.
“Next year we plan to launch around ten products in the Indian market. It is going to be an exciting and busy year for us,” Audi India Head Joe King said.
Elaborating further he said the products would be the combination of new variants of existing model range as well as products catering new segments.
Terming 2014 as the company’s best year so far in India, King said it has already surpassed last year’s sales figure and is set to further enhance its market share in the luxury segment.
Besides, the company is also preparing to bring in more investments into the country, he added.

“We are looking to bring in next round of investments into the country, keeping in mind the immense long term potential of the Indian market,” King said. He, however, did not share further details.
Commenting on the A3 Cabriolet launch, King said the compact luxury segment is growing the fastest in the luxury car industry and the introduction of compact convertible will further strengthen the company’s dominance in this space.

The four seater car comes with a lightweight soft top, sporting a 1.8 litre petrol engine with a top speed of 242 km/h.
“First showcased at the Auto Expo this year, the car received an overwhelming response from customers which prompted us to introduce the product in India,” King said.
Audi A3 Cabriolet has been priced at Rs 44.75 lakh in India.
In 2013, Audi sold 10,002 units in India, becoming the first luxury car maker to cross the 10,000-unit milestone and stay as the number one ahead of German rivals Mercedes (9,003 units) and BMW (7,327 units).
Earlier this year, the company had launched the A3 sedan in India. It is the first model from the Audi stable to be locally produced before being launched in India.
Other models, such as sedans A6 and A4; SUVs Q5, Q7 and Q3 which are locally produced now were imported as completely built units (CBUs) at the time of launch.
The annual capacity at VW group firm Skoda’s Aurangabad plant for all Audi models is more than 14,000 units in a one-shift operation.

Govt needs a political solution to pass GST Bill: Experts02:30 pm
In a huge setback for the most ambitious tax reform, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill may not get a go through in this session of Parliament as the stand-off between states and Centre on key issues pertaining to the Bill do not seem to be getting resolved.
Satya Poddar, Partner - Tax & Regulatory Services at EY, says the development has come as a surprise and “puts us back to where we were before the elections”.
Sachin Menon, COO Tax & Head of Indirect Tax, KPMG in India, feels GST is reality that will come but the timeline is yet to be seen.
Below is the transcript of Satya Poddar and Sachin Menon's interview with CNBC-TV18's Menaka Doshi and Senthil Chengalvarayan.
Menaka: A quick comment from you on what you make of the fact that we keep getting stuck at the same places – petroleum, alcohol, entry tax, these are the same issues of difference of opinion between the centre and the states?
Poddar: The announcement is absolutely stunning. We were back to where we were before the elections and it looks like the government hasn’t made an inch of progress in resolving the dispute and this is all the more surprising because even till yesterday Jayant Sinha was making the announcement in the newspapers saying that they have resolved all of the issues. However based on today's announcement by the empowered committee chair this doesn’t appear to be the case at all.
Menaka: Why are you surprised because the standoff on petroleum especially or even on alcohol today in the newspapers, the spirits lobby has put out a half page ad pleading the states to agree to allow alcohol to be included in the constitutional amendment bill. These are all same points of difference that have existed for several months now?
Poddar: Alcohol I understand. However you were given to believe by the centre that they have reached a compromise with the states to zero rate petroleum products. Petroleum will be inside the GST but will be zero rated at the beginning and only over time they will be taxing it. 
I understand that even entry tax was to be fully subsumed because the Maharashtra government is having all kinds of difficulties and number of dealers from Maharashtra state went and met the finance minister Jaitley and they pleaded that the entry tax be discontinued after GST commences. I don’t know why those issues have resurfaced again.
Indications I have is that the main opposition is coming from the state of Gujarat which is stunning because we were hoping that Prime Minister Modi taking the control at the centre Gujarat will be little more conciliatory.
However the demands that have come in are perhaps coming from Gujarat. Gujarat is making all these demands not because they make any economic sense but simply as a negotiating ploy with the centre. Gujarat collects about Rs 8000 crore from the centre sales tax which is collected in a producing state and they are afraid that the GST will not adequately compensate them for the loss of this CST revenue. That is why they are demanding that the revenue guarantee given by the centre for any loss in the revenues be of 5 year period, centre has offered only three years of compensation.
On top of that the reason they want petroleum to be outside is because Gujarat is collecting lot of cash on natural gas exports to other states which go into fertiliser production. Under the GST regime there are significant doubts that the state will be able to continue to levy the tax on production inputs like natural gas going into fertilisers and Gujarat doesn’t want to give it up no matter how irrational that tax is on natural gas.
Menaka: What are you picking up in terms of whether we are likely to make any progress or whether this winter session is definitely not going to see the passage of the Constitutional Amendment Bill?
Menon: The issues which were discussed now by Satya were there for long time. The states which are in a better position in terms of the current tax regime, where they have enough taxes through industrial sales etc they are the people who are actually having concerns or reservation about GST.
Menaka: The point is that these reservations were not new, they are age old. This issue about petroleum, alcohol, entry tax all are age old. If we haven’t been able to resolve them so far, if the centre is not willing to give in to the states demands justifiably so then what does this mean for how quickly we can get GST onboard?
Menon: GST is a reality which is going to come. The only question is whether it will happen now or little later. The point is that most of the issues are getting resolved. There is no inch of progress I won't agree to Satya's statement. There is progress. There are states which are having reservations. Especially Gujarat being a state which has spent a lot of money on incentives and attracting investment thinking that that would bring in revenue in terms of industrial sales tax etc are really jittery which we can understand.
As far as these issues are concerned may be at best this could be some way of negotiating a better deal for the state.
Menaka: Are you saying that it seems like this winter session at least we will not see the passage of the constitutional amendment bill? Do you think it will pass through this session?
Menon: I hope so. 
Menaka: Do you think at this point in time based on the developments that you think that this will pass this session? If not will we make the deadline of 2016?
Poddar: The thing that is unknown today is whether the centre is prepared to table the bill without agreement of the empowered committee. My own feeling is that's a political call the government has to make in the next few days. If they do decide to table the bill without empowered committee consensus then I am pretty certain that the bill will pass because government will table the bill only if they are confident they can get the majority in the two houses to pass the bill.
My own feeling is that this impasse that has been created by the empowered committee will not have a technical solution of the type that the government has been trying for the past few days. It has to be a political solution. Prime Minister Modi himself has to intervene in the discussion and he has to put pressure on his own former state Gujarat to shut up and go along with the GST. I think soon after Modi came to the centre Gujarat had softened its opposition in public comment. I have a feeling that softening is an indication that Narendra Modi will be able to bide consensus of the states and most importantly Gujarat.

Journals Accept Paper By Maggie Simpson  Edna Krabappelreddit
Maggie Simpson is known more for her red pacifier than her gray matter. But somehow the youngest member of the fictional "Simpsons" clan had the brainpower to co-author a scientific paper and have it accepted for publication by not one but two real-life journals.
The unlikely tale begins with Dr. Alex Smolyanitsky, a Colorado-based materials scientist. As Smolyanitsky told The Huffington Post in an email, he was looking for a way to spotlight the laughably weak peer-review process used by certain scientific journals--ones that seem quick to accept just about any submitted paper as long as the author pays up.
So with the help of an online gibberish-generating program called SCIGen , Smolyanitsky prepared an article full of scientific mumbo-jumbo so nonsensical that even Homer could have spotted the prank--just have a look at a few of the opening lines from the paper , entitled "Fuzzy, Homogeneous Configurations:"
Unified perfect symmetries have led to many unproven advances, including Markov models and write-ahead logging. While prior solutions to this quagmire are excellent, none have taken the real-time method we propose in this work. On a similar note, this is a direct result of the evaluation of replication. Obviously, Internet QoS and reliable information are rarely at odds with the deployment of journaling file systems.
If you're not quite sure that's nonsense, take it from Smolyanitsky. As he said in the email, the entire paper is "about nothing."
Smolyanitsky submitted the paper to Computational Intelligence and Electronic Systems and the Aperito Journal of NanoScience Technology, listing as the authors "Margaret Simpson" and her equally fictional friend Edna Krabappel, along with someone by the name of Kim Jong Fun.
"I wanted first and foremost to come up with something that gives out the fake immediately ," Smolyanitsky told Vox. "My only regret is that the second author isn't Ralph Wiggum."
But if the journals spotted the hoax, they didn't let on.
"The first journal (JCIES) only sent the acceptance letter, but since Maggie Simpson never paid, it wasn't published," Smolyanitsky joked in the email. "The fact of acceptance is important. The second journal currently has it as 'article in press,' though no one paid them either. They probably felt that it was a good idea to add such glorious scientific content to an otherwise empty page."
Pretty funny. And it's not the first time one of these publications--some call them " predatory journals "-- has been caught accepting a bogus paper.
Last month the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology accepted for publication a paper with the dubious title "Get Me Off Your F***ing Mailing List," The Guardian reported. The paper consisted of the seven words of the title repeated over and over again.
As for Smolyanitsky, he's hoping even more embarrassments lie in store for the journals (which didn't respond immediately to a request for comment). He said in the email, "I encourage every researcher receiving spam from such journals to take a moment and do what I did" and use SCIGen to create a dummy paper and submit it.
It only takes about 10 minutes, he said. In other words, it's so easy that Maggie's dad could do it.
D'oh.

Public Sector Bankers Paid  Very Poorly   Rues SBI ChiefNew Delhi: Lamenting that bankers are paid very poorly in India, especially at public sector banks, SBI chief Arundhati Bhattacharya on Thursday said there is an urgent need to provide better remuneration to attract good talent.
Bankers are paid poorly in India as compared to their counterparts elsewhere in the world, she said.
"Let me start with income of banking professionals in India. Here, 70 per cent of the banks are in public sector and they are paid very very poorly compared to market," she said at Delhi Economic Conclave here.
The SBI chief said there is urgent need to improve quality of board members by providing them suitable remuneration so that the overall efficiency improves.
"We are very blessed in that. SBI has invariably had very good quality board. But that may not be true across (other banks') board. One of the reasons is very low remuneration that is given to the board directors," she said.
"If you are trying to attract best in the field, they have to be remunerated accordingly. We must insist on people who are coming into the board having sufficient hands on experience in both planning and execution in their respective areas," she said.
So, this is something that government can easily implemented and should be done, she added.
The comments come about a week after PSU bank employee unions went to a four-day relay strike to press for early revision of wages.
Talking about changing regulation in tune with the present system, Bhattacharya said India has over 60 Acts and multiple rules and regulations that govern the financial system at the moment.
"Many of the laws are from 1950s and 1960s. The banking regulations themselves they were established before ATMs, credit cards, internet banking, investment advisory, private banking, mutual funds,... whole lot of other things," she said.
"These acts have been amended from time to time to keep pace with changing reality but the legal foundations have remained more or less static and as the result the framework is very complex and inconsistent," she said.
"Occasionally, it is also open to regulatory arbitrage.
So, we need to look at these things also holistically and move the laws to be in tandem with the times," she added.

Regulator directs Fannie  Freddie to fill affordable housing fundRegulator directs Fannie, Freddie to fill affordable housing fund
File photo shows the headquarters of mortgage lender Freddie Mac in McLean
Jason Reed
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Monday spelled out the terms under which they will accept mortgages with down payments of as low as 3 percent from first-time buyers, but it may take time to see how many lenders will sign on to the initiative. ( Mary Ellen Podmolik )
The companies were meant to capitalize the National Housing Trust Fund that Congress created more than six years ago, but their regulator barred them from paying into the fund after they were bailed out by taxpayers at the height of the financial crisis.
Now that both firms have returned to profitability, their current regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said it was time to reverse course.
The “allocation would not contribute to the financial instability” of the mortgage firms, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt said in letters to their chief executives.

The FTC also charged that the defendants failed to disclose the fact that some consumers were compensated for their endorsements of Sensa. In some instances, compensation included payments of $1,000 or $5,000 and trips to Los Angeles.
Consumers who bought Sensa can still file a complaint with the FTC, but no additional refunds are available, the agency said

Tribunal upholds I-T stand on tax demand on ...Tribunal upholds income tax authorities' stand on raising tax demand on Vodafone

(The tribunal held that the…)
MUMBAI: In a fresh blow to Vodafone India, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal has ruled that the tax authorities have the powers to raise a demand on the telecom major in the Rs 8,500 crore transfer-pricing dispute.
The case relates to the sale of one of its call centres in Ahmedabad in 2007.
The tribunal held that the company had structured the deal with another India-based entity Hutchison Whampoa Properties with the intention to circumvent the transfer pricing norms, even though it was an international transaction wherein there was no arm's length dealing between the two related entities.
However, the tribunal has sent the case back to the Income Tax department, asking them to revise the amount to be recovered from the company.
The Mumbai bench of ITAT, in a 189-page order yesterday, ruled that the deal relating to sale of the call centre business was structured with the motive to "circumvent the transfer pricing provisions of the Income Tax Act" and was in essence an "international transaction between two related parties and thus would be subject to the transfer pricing provisions".
Presiding officers Vijay Pal Rao and R C Sharma said: "According to us, this is an international transaction since the assignment of the call option took place."
In a partial reprieve for the company, the tribunal however sent the case back to the I-T dept for determining the revised taxable amount as it did not accept the valuation arrived at by the tax authority.
"Vodafone India's appeal is partly allowed," the presiding officers said.
A Vodafone India spokesman refused to comment on the development, saying that only its London headquarters could offer a reaction. A mail sent to the company's spokesman in London did not elicit any response.
The dispute relates to the sale of the Ahmedabad-based call centre business (Vodafone India Services formerly known as 3 Global Services) for assessment year 2008-09. The department slapped a tax demand on the company on October 31, 2012 under sections 143(3) and 144C(13) of the Income Tax Act.
Vodafone India Services was originally incorporated in March 1999 in the name of 3 Global Services as a wholly-owned arm of Hutchison Teleservices India Holdings , a company incorporated in Mauritius. Hutchison Teleservices, in turn, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGP Investments Holdings , incorporated in the Cayman Islands .
Transfer pricing involves related entities dealing at arm's length to ensure fair pricing of the asset that is transferred.
The dispute had arisen after the tax authority issued draft transfer pricing order in December 2011 and added Rs 8,500 crore to Vodafone's taxable income for sale of its call centre business in 2007.
In February 2012, Vodafone challenged the jurisdiction of the Income Tax department before the ITAT and also approached the Bombay High Court.
In 2013, the Income Tax department had issued a tax demand of Rs 3,700 crore to Vodafone India. However, the tribunal had stayed the demand during the pendency of the plea and directed Vodafone to deposit Rs 200 crore by February 15, 2014 which it had done.
Vodafone's counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued that the Supreme Court order of February 2011 had upheld the company's position that there being no assignment of call options there was no question of taxable income.
He also argued that the sale of the call centre business was between two domestic companies and that the transfer pricing officer had no jurisdiction over the deal. Vodafone counsel added that they had established a conclusive case at the prima facie stage.
This is not the only tax dispute the British telecom giant is facing in the country. In another dispute, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Vodafone in October, saying it need not pay an additional tax of Rs 3,200 crore as demanded by the tax authority.
The company is also about to begin an international arbitration against the government claim of Rs 21,000 crore in taxes as capital gains levy for its purchase of Hutchison assets in February 2007.
The government claims that Vodafone should have deducted capital gains tax when it made the USD 11 billion payment to Hutchison while purchasing its India assets. This argument was quashed by the Supreme Court in February 2011 but the then government introduced retro tax in that year's budget, prompting Vodafone to challenge the validity of the claim at an international court of arbitration.

The International Tourist Bureau/Passenger Reservation Centre for foreign tourists and non-resident Indians at New Delhi Station shall function round-the-clock from tomorrow, said a senior Northern Railway official.
Till now it was operational from 8 AM to 8 PM. The opening of the ticketing centre for foreign tourists for 24 hours will act as a deterrent to touts operating in the area, the official said.
There are about 20,000 foreigners who avail the facility for booking tickets daily. Passport is required to issue tickets to foreigners here, he said.
Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu , who had visited the centre on Monday, had instructed the concerned authorities to make it operational 24 hours to provide uninterrupted facility to foreigners.

(Govt's decision to relax FDI norms…)
MUMBAI: The government's decision to relax FDI norms in the construction sector is likely to attract private equity investments to the tune of up to $3 billion in the real estate market in the next two years, according to property consultant Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).
The real estate private equity market inflows which stood at around $1-1.5 billion per annum over the last few years, is likely to double in the next two years due to the relaxation of FDI norms, JLL Chief Operating Officer (business and international) Ramesh Nair said in a statement.
"The government's announcement of easier FDI norms for the construction sector has generated a lot of excitement among country's real estate players. The fact that 100 per cent FDI will now be allowed under automatic route to invest in completed assets along with relaxation of other norms, it is expected that FDI inflows will increase significantly," he said.
He said the modification of the 3-year lock-in period basically opens the portals wide for FDI funds who were deterred by this clause so far.
"It also means that there will be more pressure on developers to accelerate construction of projects being funded so that these funds can exit at a favourable time," Nair added.
Investors will now be permitted to exit either on completion of the project, or after the completion of support infrastructure in the project such as internal and approach roads, water supply, street lights, sewerage, among others.
This new exit feature correctly assumes that the successful deployment of such infrastructure is a major landmark point in a project's life cycle, post which all other development will happen assuredly and according to stipulated time lines, he said.
"Allowing 100 per cent FDI automatic route in completed project for operation and management of not only townships but also shopping complexes and business centres, will enable developers to sell completed malls and integrated townships to foreign investors. This will significantly increase the volume of the retail real estate business," he said.
Also, with a lot more projects qualifying under FDI funding, the refinancing business will see significant increase, Nair said.

NEW DELHI: Wipro today said trustees of the Wipro Inc Benefit Trust have sold more than 18 lakh shares of the country's third-largest software firm in a deal estimated to be worth over Rs 100 crore.
"All the 18,10,388 shares of Wipro, which were held by Wipro Inc Benefit Trust have been sold at an average market price of Rs 552.43 per share," Wipro said in a filing to the BSE.
It added that the sale took place between December 9 and December 11, 2104.
In a filing on October 22, Wipro had said Wipro Inc Benefit Trust held 1.8 million shares of the company, arising out of a scheme of amalgamation between CMango India , Mpower Software Services India and Mpact Technology Services with Wipro Limited in 2007.
Since the trust deed provides for dissolution following the sale of shares, the trustees are now permitted to sell the shares in open market, it had said.

India's organised cold storage industry out of deep freeze
The success of Snowman Logistics' Initial Public Offering (IPO) proves that India's organised cold storage industry is finally out of deep freeze

Barely 5 percent of India’s USD 5 billion cold storage industry is organised. But improving macro-economic conditions have got the country's top logistics players excited and many of them are attempting to become integrated cold chain service providers. Several companies are lining up significant capital expenditure (capex) plans in to capture the cold storage business reports CNBC-TV18s Farah Bookwala Vhora.
The success of Snowman Logistics' Initial Public Offering (IPO) proves that India's organised cold storage industry is finally out of deep freeze. Logistics and dedicated cold storage companies are sprucing up their capex plans with an intention to become a one-stop service provider for cold storage solutions. With a strong foothold in cold storage transportation, Coldex, India’s second largest cold chain provider, now hopes to increase its presence in the warehousing business. It aims to build 8 warehousing centres across India through a capex of Rs 150 crore over the next 3 years. This, it says, will increase its capacity from 6,000 pallets to 30,000 pallets.
Sunil Nair, CEO, ColdEX India says, “all our facilities will be integrates. We will offer other services as well like labelling etc.”
Coldex is not alone. Gati, wants to replicate the hub & spoke model of its express delivery biz in its cold chain unit, Gati Kauser, to be able to offer integrated services. It intends to set up 10 cold chain warehouses of 50,000 pallets over the next two and half years. This will entail a capex of Rs 200 crore. Gati Kauser sold a minority stake to Mandala Capital for Rs 150 crore in October, which would be used for expansion.
Experts say cold storage companies are moving towards becoming integrated service providers because it is a highly lucrative biz model.
Nikhil Khandelwal, Director, Systematix Group says, “margins get better when you offer integrated services. To be sustainable you need to be integrated.”
With the economy picking up, players can finally leveraging the support system put in place by the previous govt which allow 100 percent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in cold storage, subsidy funding to the tune of 40 percent of the cost of the project and a financial outlay of Rs 5,000 crore for cold chain infrastructure and food parks.

Contextualizing Approaches to Urbanizationreddit
As an architect, the urban condition has always been of particular interest to my work. I am endlessly fascinated by the city as a site of opportunity for innovation. The city forces its residents to engage with diverse groups, ideas and spaces. This process is sometimes explosive and sometimes gradual, but it is always transformative, producing new subjectivities and modes of interaction. The present moment is no different. The global population explosion, coupled with the most rapid urbanization in recorded history, has fundamentally altered urban life in every region of the world.
Currently, half of the world's population resides in urban areas, and this proportion is expected to rise to 70 percent in the next thirty years. One of the most pressing questions confronting architects and urban planners is how to enable cities to meet the new infrastructural and cultural demands at this critical juncture. To achieve this, I believe it is crucial to contextualize the present moment within a larger historical narrative about the city's enduring and dynamic relationship with density and change.
This is a story of incredible elasticity, one in which cities have adapted incredibly well to a long line of paradigmatic ruptures across time. The lessons inherent in this narrative demonstrate how architecture can serve as the technology of this adaptability, deftly redefining and re-crafting space to meet the needs of society at a given moment.
Evolving Urban Forms
Perhaps the first in this series of historical ruptures occurred around 8000 BCE with the invention of agriculture. Prior to this moment, which first appeared in the Fertile Crescent region of what is now the Middle East, humans were nomadic hunter-gathers never numbering more than six million globally. The domestication of plant and animal species thanks to new technologies for irrigation and soil tilling made food surpluses possible for the first time. It was only then that permanent settlement became advantageous and the city became conceivable. The high crop yield from relatively small plots of land enabled an unprecedented concentration of people, who were now free to undertake non-subsistence based practices such as craftwork and defense. This division of labor created a new cultural complexity organized through ruling elites and governing bodies, giving rise to the first hierarchical models of society.
The production of cities is in many ways, then, also the production of our modern form of civilization. This urban revolution also produced a population explosion: in the millennium following the emergence of the first cities in Mesopotamia around 3200 BCE, this global population doubled to 14 million. Fundamentally, it was technological advancement coupled with a shift in population density that allowed these new social possibilities to emerge.
Architecture consolidated and made physical these wide-sweeping changes, playing a key role in the way ancient cultures made sense of their new relationship to the environment. In the early appearance of monumental architecture, I see a celebration of permanence and a culture coming to terms with a new stationary lifestyle. The Ancient Egyptians, who numbered close to 2 million by 2000 BCE, were perhaps the earliest innovators. They produced pyramids and mastabas of stunningly epic scale through sophisticated building techniques that involved the coordination of numerous highly organized labor groups. These palaces for the dead featured elaborate subterranean constructions and formed the nucleus for many of their cities. Their scale and centrality provide insight into the primacy of the afterlife in Ancient Egypt, illustrating how, from its origins, powerful architecture has always been inextricably linked to the cultural context.
Importantly, urban contexts have been powerfully distinct from their inception. There is strong evidence that the emergence of agricultural techniques in Northern China, West Africa, along the Indus River, and in Mesoamerica were independent events, springing organically from diverse indigenous practices rather than as a result of their expansion from the Fertile Crescent. As a result, the cities that emerged in these regions had their own vernaculars that responded to the particulars of their varied geographies. Beyond the employment of local materials, fundamental elements of cities ranged considerably in priorities and organization: Harrapan cities in the Indus Valley featured sophisticated well systems, for instance, while the symmetrical form of ancient Chinese cities reflected the culture's prioritization of balance. From its earliest form then, urbanism has always been diverse and global.
Indeed, in many ways the history of architectural standardization only begins during the Greco-Roman period. Once again, these empires were tasked with addressing unprecedented urban growth. By the 1st Century AD, the global population had reached 200 million, 60 million of whom lived within the Roman Empire. Rome itself became the first city to reach 1 million inhabitants around 133 BC, compared to the approximately 200,000-300,000 who populated the cities of previous ancient civilizations. Due to this massive change in urban density, the need to organize space and cultivate infrastructural systems both within cities and across trade networks became pressing.
The resulting innovations constituted a significant rupture from previous ideas about spatial arrangement and set templates that continue to dominate architectural thought today. Classicism's architectural formality, reflected in both its typologies and urban plans, celebrated the period's fascination with studied organisation. Abstraction of space became refined and codified as a science, cultivating a marked distinction between the planned and organic city. The former became glorified as a civic ideal, a means to strengthen network connectivity and experiences of citizenship across its empire.
By and large, the forms and patterns established during this period remain of fundamental relevance today, thanks in large part to the legacy of colonization. The European Renaissance's renewed interest in classical urbanism became a convenient tool for the expansion of growing empires. Renaissance thinkers upheld classical urban features, such as orthogonal grids, central forums and architectural formality as superlative models, thereby justifying their imposition into nearly every region of world. These colonial projects imitated Roman development not only in form, but in function as well, employing classical inspiration to confer legitimacy onto themselves and enhance imperial unity. By and large, this is a period of singularity: a rejection of indigenous insights into regional geography and climate in favor of default standards of geometry and form, which bore little connection to what had come before.
Without ignoring colonial architecture's undeniably significant contributions to urbanism, it remains critical to recognize what the legacy of colonialism has managed for so long to obscure: namely, the achievements of complex and independent urban systems preceding colonial intervention. While Medieval Europe saw mass de-urbanization following the collapse of the Roman Empire, contemporaneous civilizations in disparate regions such as Middle Niger, Northern China, and Mesoamerica were thriving. Each constructed unique innovative adaptations to their respective environments. China, which housed approximately 60 million people by the second century CE, cultivated planning systems that oriented their cities around airflow. These highly organized urban layouts, which often featured a numerology-based system of gates and increasingly private areas towards the center, visibilized the society's relationship with order, stability and reverence.
Mayan cities, which experienced a classical period from 250 to 900 CE, were constructed at high elevations and featured stone platforms that elevated residences above flood levels to respond to their tropical forest climate. The centers of cities such as Becan and Tikal housed arrangements of religious temples, ceremonial roads and open plazas that were guided by both cosmological beliefs and advanced mathematical skills. Meanwhile, Djenné-Djeno, the most prominent city of the Middle Niger during the 9th and 10th Centuries CE, housed incredible mud architecture that spoke to the primacy of the relationship between that civilization and its ecology. The urban character and architectural styles of each of these regions were incredibly distinct, but united in their responsiveness to the specificities of their contexts. Each offers insights into how to create a specific architecture of place that is sustainable and promotes ecological balance - insights that are increasingly relevant today in the era of green living, sustainability and a return to the local scale.
The unfolding of urban changes prior to the 19th Century is slow and gradual compared to what followed. The wide-ranging changes instigated by the Industrial Revolution inaugurated the rapid urbanization that characterizes the state of the city today. Headway in medical technologies again led to a global population explosion: In the middle of the 18th Century, at the cusp of the Industrial Revolution, world population stood around 700 million. Just fifty years later, that number had swollen to one billion, and doubled from that by the 1920's. At the same time, the proportion of people living in cities dramatically increased, as mechanization of agriculture drove hordes of diverse individuals into urban environments in search of new employment. In Europe, the number of people living in urban areas grew by 100 million between 1800 and 1910, compared to an increase of just five million between 1300 and 1700.
Again, these new densities required adaptation from the modern city. Modernity ushered in nothing short of an architectural revolution, which came most visibly in the form of the skyscraper. Made possible through a confluence of inventions including fluorescent lighting, elevators, steel frame construction and electric arc welding, the skyscraper's verticality represented a new model for urban expansion that both maximized the efficiency of valuable land and monumentalized modern innovation. Coupled with the large scale implementation of the gridiron urban form and standardized housing projects and factory typologies, the modern city reflected the logic of Fordism in its repetition and ambition to supersede nature through technological innovation. American cities were the paradigmatic examples, with New York and Chicago competing for influence at the turn of the century through the construction of increasingly taller skyscrapers. Modernism's fetishization of replicability made it the ideal language of globalization, and still today cities across the world wishing to announce themselves as economic and cultural forces feel compelled to erect skyscrapers of incredible scale, whose impressiveness is one of the definitive technologies of urban identity.
The Urban Condition Today
By the middle of the 20th Century, the world began to confront the full implications of modernity's ruthless pursuit of efficiency. Strict zoning had segmented cities so thoroughly that sector atrophy left many industrial cities in decay or abandoned. A new generation of urban activists such as Jane Jacobs alerted the world to the ways in which modernist developments had stretched the classical model far beyond the human scale, disconnecting urban residents from their own habitat and working against its own ideals. The verticality that skyscrapers inaugurated, once considered utopian in its ability to literally elevate the masses, became politically questionable as high-rise developments increasingly allowed an elite class to escape unsustainable and unlivable conditions on the ground. This is perhaps most evident today in the urban areas of the developing world, such as Lagos or Mumbai, where regimentally planned districts of glittering towers stand in stark contrast to ground-level chaotic slums that lack the most basic infrastructure.
The limitations of the modern impulse to conceive a universal urban ideal has in some instances given way to a postmodern impulse to abandon those goals in favor of a purely aesthetic or economic vision of architecture. This is facilitated by a context of increased corporatisation, where independent and often international developers buying up land to maximize their financial returns without considering the implications for urban planning. Meanwhile, rapid industrialization's unchecked exploitation of land and resources has led to an unmanageable degree of urban energy consumption and waste production. Cities today guzzle three-quarters of the world's energy and produce the same proportion of the world's pollution.
Cities are thus now left with the urgent need to develop new strategies that can address this problematic legacy while simultaneously accommodating its rapidly increasing number of new residents. One approach in recent years has been the renewal of inner city areas that were left impoverished or in disuse due to industry shifts. The role of architecture in this approach, which is particularly common in Western Europe and North America, is well documented: London's Tate Modern, Madrid's Matedaro and Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum have been the cornerstones of urban regeneration efforts.
Even more ambitious, Stockholm's redevelopment of its Royal Seaport works to integrate innovative smart technologies with mixed-use cultural buildings and increased green spaces to improve quality of life through effective energy monitoring and waste management and increased civic engagement. Still, these projects must contend with their implications of gentrification, and possibility of creating stratified cities where the urban elite reside in sustainable enclaves while those lacking economic resources are priced out.
Similarly, the recent proliferation of new-built eco-cities must also be intentional in their provisions for diversity and livability. These new cities, including the well-publicized Tianjin Eco-City and Masdar City, occupy various spaces between the competing forces of, on the one hand, the freedom to create idealized cities that can serve as models for sustainable development and, on the other hand, privatized gated sanctuaries for the rich and mobile. This model, which China especially has embraced to address its unprecedented demand for urban space, bears much in common with older modernist urban strategies, and thus needs to be particularly careful not just to confront environmental considerations with green technologies, but also to deploy urban planning insights into scale and livability. These eco-cities also face challenges due to the substantial upfront financial investment they necessitate, which often results in the siphoning off of resources and funding to address issues in existing cities.
Other contemporary approaches are of considerably smaller scale than these eco-cities but offer alternative paths forward. In Latin America, the most industrialized region in the world, rapid urban population growth has overwhelmed transportation infrastructure in a way that disproportionally affects the poorest residents. Medellin, where many residential slums had been pushed into the unconnected mountains surrounding the city, has been substantial success with innovative new transport options like large-scale escalators and gondolas. Meanwhile, in the coastal cities of West Africa, the rising sea levels and land erosion that has resulted from climate change has made flooding a constant concern, which threatens the informal housing developments that have extended into the water itself. Research into waterfront lagoon architecture has deepened our understanding of the ecology of these fragile coastal cities. New adaptive solutions such as floating communities offer a way to prepare for continued environmental change while also providing the infrastructure necessary to improve existing conditions. Open source data has also offered new opportunities to improve civic engagement. Several North American cities are exploring ways to utilise this resource to improve urban systems, increase service dependability and address lapses.
Architecture Moving Forward
Taken together, these approaches offer insight into the role architecture can play in crafting the urbanism of the future. It has become clear that modern singularity must be refashioned into nuanced dialogues between geography, technology and culture. Doing so requires fundamental changes in the way architecture and urban planning are approached. Zoning practices, rather than encouraging experimentation, by and large are engaged with a romance with an outdated past. Current conditions require a more dynamic model that allows for mutable conditions and that rejects simplicity in favor of granular mutation of different types of uses from which a richness can erupt in the city. Architecture is the tool with which we test these new mutable conditions; hybridizing types is a means of forcing new conversations, releasing ourselves from singularity and presenting individuals with the opportunity to learn about an urbanism of the future.
The unprecedented densities of cities today demands new solutions that go beyond planar architecture, and which can prepare the ground for the future city through innovations in vertical typologies. These typologies must become more complex, must move beyond spectacle of scale to become something that empowers people, that enriches its surroundings and which promises a more egalitarian future. Inherent in an effective execution of this is a meaningful examination of the nature of the civic project today. As we move away from the singular narratives of formality and away from projects that speak to some far off ideal, how can public architecture speak to the multiplicity of a diverse public?
I believe in finding ways to move existing narratives of place forward, whether by emerging a forgotten or undiscovered story or by adding nuance and complexity to that which is already present. Innovating typologies must be about pushing to ask what is needed from public space today. It must be a process of distilling the essential components of the urban experience and exploring ways to meaningfully recombine these elements in a way that enhances livability in a world of increased density. This means, for instance, approaching affordable housing as a place of lifelong learning and of sustainable community building in addition to a residence; or approaching a library as a place of cultural celebration and skill development. Doing so organically leads to hybridized typologies that can foster these multiple experiences of place and which offer new ideas about what well-being can look like. As modernism has shown, singularity produces a ghettoization that we must move beyond for urban life to improve.
This requires rigorous examinations of geography, culture and their intersections. Each culture has its own unique ambiguities, challenges and potentials, and it's my belief that architecture has the capacity to move narratives forward by adding richness and offering new possibilities. Learning from and building on what has come before is the critical way to bring the kind of legibility into the work that I consider crucial. It is only through this process of critical investigation that emerging dormant narratives and adding meaningful complexity becomes possible. From this investigation, a nuanced layering of form, function or materiality can emerge, which will in turn offers multiple access points for engagement.
These engagement points come from the recognition of narratives of place as holistic and un-erasable. Finding ways to re-emerge traditional insights into place and integrating them with modernist approaches is crucial in this process. Resisting the urge to refit the geography of a place to suit the needs of a project, but instead allowing that geography and the culture to complicate and shape the project, to guide the systems and functions needed, produces an architecture that is truly distinctive and responsive. Moving beyond dichotomies of rural and urban, the present moment is one in which sustainability will be defined by the capacity to cultivate urban systems that integrate and enhance the ecology of place, whether through materiality that works with, rather than against, climate or through designs that seek to celebrate, rather than close off from, the nature and landscape that surrounds it. This process is the means to an architecture of place, one which points not to an idealized elsewhere but instead engages directly in the possibilities of a specific place in time. It is in this way that architecture can serve as a celebration of its context, and by extension, its people.
The city is a perpetually incomplete project; it is constantly being remade and reshaped by the changing state of our world, whether by the interventions of its governing bodies or the powerful actions of its residents. Architecture can and must speak to this adaptability, as both a technology and reflection of social change. The undoing of the master narratives of modernism should not be taken as an opportunity for an architecture of spectacle and fantasy, but instead one that, utilizing the lessons of the past, speaks to the complexities of the present and the forces that shape us. It is crucial to deconstruct the idea that design can be universal and instead, to think in terms of an architecture that derives inspiration from the specificity of geography, culture and place.

Gujarat pharma market grew highest at 22.4% in November: AIOCDGujarat pharma market grew highest at 22.4% in November: AIOCD
BS Reporter | Ahmedabad Dec 11, 2014 08:59 PM IST
Gujarat market clocked the highest growth rate in pharmaceuticals during November, beating the industry growth rate. According to data from the market research firm AIOCD Pharmasofttech AWACS, Gujarat market grew by 22.4 per cent last month, double the growth rate of the Indian pharmaceuticals market, which grew by 10.9 per cent.
From regional perspective 14 regions have outgrown the industry growth rate. Gujarat market grew the highest at 22.4 per cent followed by Chattisgarh market at 19.6 per cent and Madhya Pradesh Market at 19.3 per cent, showed AIOCD data. No regions had negative growth in November 2014.
After the peak in September 2014 (18.8 per cent year-on-year growth), the Indian pharma market showed a dip due to external environment, however the market picked up in November with a  growth at 10.9 per cent. The price increases of medicines during the month have been around 5 per cent, which has been the highest in the last 12 months, claimed AIOCD.  
A senior official of the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association, Gujarat State Board said that most of the Gujarat-based pharma producers have got the benefit of the price increase. "Some of the mid-sized firms could capture more market share with new drug launches as well as more concerted marketing efforts," he said wishing not to be quoted as IDMA was yet to compile month-wise sales growth data.
As per AIOCD data, Gujarat-based companies like Torrent Pharma and Corona Remedies have clocked growth rates of 23.3 per cent and 21.9 per cent respectively.
Overall, during the quarter, the Indian pharma market (IPM) has grown by 12.1 per cent on a year-on-year basis, which is higher than the previous quarter (10.4 per cent) as well the corresponding quarter last fiscal (3.2 per cent). According to AIOCD, the IPM clocked Rs 7243 crore in November 2014.
In all around 21 corporate have crossed the growth of IPM for the month of November 2014 amongst top 50 companies. Amongst the top 50 Corporate, Akumentis has the highest growth of 68 per cent followed by Pfizer at 34.1 per cent & Ajanta at 33.1 per cent. Data also showed that Indian companies have grown at 9.5 per cent versus 14.9 per cent for multinational firms in November 2014.
Especially, under the non-National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) category, MNCs beat Indian companies by a significant margin in growth; while MNCs clocked 11.1 per cent growth rate in the category, Indian firms grew only 0.4 per cent.

Micro enterprises receiving aid under PMEGP in Gujarat down by 50% in 3 yrsIndia manufacturing activity expands to 2-year high as orders surge; PMI at 54.5 in Dec
In the last three years, the number of micro-enterprises receiving financial assistance under the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) in Gujarat has halved, reducing the creation of new employment opportunities by 30 percent.
PMEGP is a credit-linked subsidy programme meant for generating employment in the country by setting up micro-entreprises in the non-farm sector. The financial assistance under this scheme is available only to new units where the maximum project cost should not exceed Rs 25 lakh in manufacturing sector and Rs 10 lakh in the service sector.
Under this programme, only 914 units in Gujarat received financial assistance of about Rs 25 crore in 2013-14 fiscal. This only half over the numbers that existed in 2011-12, when over 1863 units were given margin money subsidy of over Rs 61 crore.
Even the estimated employment generated by these units have fallen to 13,420 in 2013-14 to 18,662 in 2011-12, states the figures released by Union Minister of State, Micro Small & Medium Enterprises, Giriraj Singh in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.
The PMEGP scheme launched in August 2008 targets to generate continuos and sustainable employment opportunities in both urban and rural areas of the country through setting up of micro-enterprises.
In the year 2013-14, over 50,460 units were assisted under the scheme across the country. A total margin money subsidy of Rs 988 crore was releasted to these units that generated employment for about 3.68 lakh people.

Having existed over a decade as a brand for inbound investments in to the state, the brand “Vibrant Gujarat” seems to be spreading it’s wings and going pan-India. The upcoming seventh edition of the state government sponsored Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors’ Summit (VGGIS) has a for first time organised a “exclusive” international trade summit titled: ‘Vibrant India First’, that will feature India as a “preferred sourcing destination”.
This B2B or  business-to-business event scheduled to be held on January 12-13, 2015 at the Mahatma Gandhi Mandir convention centre, Gandhinagar will be hosted by the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) —- set up by the Union Ministry of Commerce & Industry —- which has joined the Vibrant Gujarat summit for the first time, official sources said.
“This is a pan-India trade platform created especially for the MSME players. That  is the reason we are calling it Vibrant India First. This will provide a good exposure to the Indian manufacturers and is in line with Prime Minister’s ‘Make in India’ campaign,” said Amit Goyal, vice-president and regional chairman (Western Region), FIEO.
The “Vibrant India First” trade summit will see top leaders and 120 foreign buyers and importers from 18 odd countries from the “emerging markets” of African & ASEAN region. These countries include Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Hongkong, Ethopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Tanzania.
“The summit will also feature 350-400 companies from across India. They will hold one-on-one meetings with foreign buyers and importers who will be present during the event,” says Nihar Lakhia, Joint Director of FIEO (Western Region). The summit will feature India as one of the largest market that provides a great potential for trade and technology. It seeks to hard sell India as cost-effective destination for sourcing technology and production in comparison to US and European Union.
When asked the reasons behind FIEO move to associate with the Vibrant Gujarat summit, Lakhia said, “We have been working closely with the Government of Gujarat since the last couple of years. We had done a study on the export competitiveness of Gujarat, which was released by the then state chief minister Narendra Modi in 2013. Thereafter in order to increase the export potential of Gujarat, we have been working with iNDEXTb (Industrial Extension Bureau) on various capacity building programmes in the state. The idea of this trade summit was borne out of the fact that Government of Gujarat wanted to create a trade platform, especially for the MSME sector. Now that Modi has become the PM, the scope of the summit stands expanded.”
The event meant to “assist enterprises in establishing new business contacts” will see prefixed one-to-one meetings between Indian manufacturer/exporters and their foreign counterparts. There are about eight focus sectors which the Vibrant India trade summit will focus upon. This includes, Engineering, Electrical and Electronic equipment, Chemicals, Pharmaceutical products, Textiles, Plastics, Power equipment and Medical equipment.
Officials of FIEO claimed that the title of “Vibrant India” was born out of “Vibrant Gujarat” brand and was designed in consultation with the iNDEXTb. However, the organisation may change the name of the summit to “Business@India First” in the days of come, after a request for the same has come from the state government.
The summit will also see Indian manufacturers displaying their goods and products at an exhibition that is part of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors’ Summit 2015. “This will help the foreign importers get a personal feel of the product being sold by the Indian companies,” Lakhia added.

Page-turner: Pranab s book throws new light on EmergencyPranab's book throws new light on Emergency
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 11, 2014

About forty years after then prime minister Indira Gandhi imposed the Emergency, her staunch loyalist and President Pranab Mukherjee has disclosed that Gandhi “wasn’t aware of the Constitutional provisions allowing for the declaration of Emergency”.
In his autobiography “The Dramatic Decade: The Indira Gandhi Years” released on Thursday, Mukherjee describes the dark period in India’s democracy as a “misadventure” that was “perhaps an avoidable event”.
“It is believed then Bengal chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray played an important role in the declaration of Emergency; it was his suggestion, and Gandhi acted on it,” writes Mukherjee, then a junior minister in Gandhi’s government.
“In fact, Gandhi told me subsequently she wasn’t even aware of the Constitutional provisions allowing for the declaration of Emergency,” the President writes.
Ray later denied any hand in the decision before the Shah Commission, constituted to probe “excesses” between 1975 and 1977, the period Emergency was clamped. Gandhi called for elections in March 1977 and was handed a resounding defeat by the Janata Party, losing her own Rae Bareli seat.
Mukherjee’s book, released on his 79th birthday, is the first of a trilogy. This book looks back at the 1969-1980 period with the next two volumes covering the periods 1980- 1998 and 1998- 2012 respectively.
The Dramatic Decade has also been in the news recently after bookstores cried foul over a deal between the publisher Rupa and Amazon.com for its exclusive online sale for the first 21 days.
In his autobiography, the President writes he and other ministers hadn’t really understood the far-reaching impact of the Emergency.
“While there is no doubt that it brought with it some major positive changes…it was perhaps an avoidable event,” he said, citing suspension of fundamental rights and political activity, press censorship and large scale arrest of political leaders as “some instances of the Emergency adversely affecting the interests of the people”.
“The Congress and Indira Gandhi had to pay a heavy price for this misadventure,” Mukherjee maintained in the book.
The autobiography provides glimpses into his excellent working relation with Gandhi, whom he considers a mentor. Mukherjee also describes himself as a “restless child” who had to walk five kilometers to school.
In his book, the 79-year-old also says offices such as the President and the vice-president “should not be held by people other than politicians” and the role of presiding officers in legislative chambers has to be “similarly viewed”.
In India, presiding officers are elected with the support of political parties and one “cannot expect” them to be free of “political inclination altogether”, Mukherjee says. “Though they must strive to remain neutral, their neutrality cannot be stretched to a ridiculous extent.”

Oil spill in Bangladesh  high alert in IndiaBangladesh oil spill threatens rare dolphins

An oil spill from a tanker that collided with an empty cargo ship in Bangladesh-Sunderbans on Tuesday has sent a chill down the spine of wildlife officials in the Sunderbans in this country. A high alert has been sounded and forest officials along with other security agencies are closely monitoring the situation in the Sunderbans.
 
“Till now there are no reports that the oil spill has reached the Indian part of the Sunderbans. All our field staffs, particularly those deployed in the camps along the Indo-Bangla border, have been alerted. Patrolling has been beefed up to check if the oil spill is spreading to the Indian Sunderbans,” Ujjwal Kumar Bhattacharya chief wildlife warden of the state, told HT.
 
A tanker named OT Southern Star 7, carrying an estimated 350,000 litres (350 tons) of oil collided on Tuesday with another empty cargo vessel and partly sank in the Sunderbans’ Shela River in Bangladesh. The cargo ship was allegedly unable to locate the Southern Star due to heavy fog.
 
Experts in both the countries are apprehending that the spill will cause massive ecological disaster in the biggest mangrove forest in the world.
 
“The oil spill will mainly affect the avifauna (animals which depend on the water) including migratory birds, the dolphins, otters, Olive Ridley Turtles and crocodiles. Many could lose their lives especially where rivers meet the sea. This is the time when migratory birds including those from Siberia frequent the Sunderbans. This is also the time when Olive Ridley Turtles come close to the beaches to lay their eggs,” said S B Mondol, former head of the state forest department.
 
The Sunderbans forest, which covers 26,000 square kilometers in India and Bangladesh, is the habitat of famous Royal Bengal Tigers. It is also a UNESCO Heritage site.
 
“We have also informed all other security agencies including the BSF and the Coast Guard which patrol our borders to check if the oil spill is approaching our border. Our boats are also patrolling the Harinbhanga River and Raimangal which forms the boundary between the Indian Sunderbans and Bangaldesh,” said S Dasgupta field director of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve.
 
But wildlife experts and NGOs working on the Sunderbans are wary and apprehend that the spill in Bangladesh could affect the Indian part as the rivers are contiguous and the oil could reach the Indian rivers especially down south where the rivers meet the Bay of Bengal.
 
“The oil could easily reach this part of the Sunderbans through the rivers. The most prone would be the areas such as Baghamara and Mechua where the delta meets the sea in the southern part of the Sunderbans. If that happens it would spell doom,” said Biswajit Roy Choudhury of Nature Environment and Wildlife Society.
 
According to Bangladesh forest authorities the oil had spread along a 40 km (25 mile) section of the Sela River and has also affected portions of Passur river. Indian forest  officials are, however, hopeful that the spill won’t affect the Indian side as each individual river  drains into the sea.

Google News to move out of SpainBy David Post December 11, 2014
Google says it is closing its news-linking service in Spain next week due to new legislation under which publishers can charge search engines for using their content. (Reuters)
Earlier this year, Spain passed a rather egregious amendment to its copyright law (to take effect in the New Year), purportedly as some kind of anti-piracy move, but more aptly called the “Google tax” by some observers.  The law gives Internet publishers a right to compensation for the use of “snippets” of their content by news aggregator sites (like Google News).  And not just a right to compensation:  an inalienable right to compensation, one that publishers cannot waive or bargain away (in return, say, for being included in the new aggregator listings).
It does seem to be part of a larger “anti-linking” trend taking hold in Europe – of a piece with the EU’s very troubling new “Right to be Forgotten,” which gives individuals the right to have the links to information about themselves deleted from search engine listings in certain circumstances. [see here,  here , and here ].  I’m not sure how much of this is anti-Google (and anti- the many other US-based companies that have managed to become very large and very powerful because of their mastery of the online environment) and how much is just anti-Internet – but it’s a very unfortunate development.
So in response  Google announced yesterday that it is pulling Google News out of Spain.
This is, in a way, precisely the way things are supposed to work in this patchwork international legal system that we have.  Spain (or Belarus, or Brazil, or the US) has its own legal regime, based (hopefully) on reasoned deliberation among its citizens based on its own set of values and its own history, and if you don’t like it, don’t come there to do business.  If Google doesn’t like Spanish law, it can just stay out of Spain. Nothing unusual about that – its the kind of decision that every company operating outside of its own national borders has to make, all the time.
But the Internet, of course, makes things a little more complicated than that.  How does Google pull out of Spain, anyway?  What they’ve said is that they will, starting on December 16, be “remov[ing] Spanish publishers from Google News, and clos[ing] Google News in Spain.”  Google News will still be available in Spain – nothing will appear at the “ news.google.es ” address, but a Spanish Internet user will still be able to do exactly the same thing I am able to do, which is to type “news.google.com” into his/her browser, and to have the Google News site displayed there.  That site will not, however, have links to publications from Spain.  [Exactly how Google is going to figure out which sites are "in Spain" and which are not is an interesting question - I suspect they have very (though not 100%) effective ways of "geolocating" sites whose servers are located within Spanish borders].
Several things may happen next.  The Spanish people may howl in outrage at their foolish and misguided legislators and get the law changed.  Not at all inconceivable; that, too, is how the system is supposed to work, and my guess (though I know not the slightest thing about Spanish politics) is that Spanish publishers, large and small, are going to be extremely unhappy that they are no longer accessible via any Google News site worldwide.
But assuming that doesn’t happen, or in the meantime, Google’s pullout does not, necessarily, mean that it will avoid liability in Spain.  One can easily imagine a scenario under which a Spanish court could say:  Google is still doing business “in Spain,” because news.google.com (not to mention all the other Google sites and services) are still accessible to Internet users in Spain. And what about those Spanish publishers that don’t get identified as such by Google’s filters – if their snippets show up on news.google.com, won’t they have a remedy in Spanish court?  And I’m no expert on the content of Spanish law, but many copyright laws around the world (including, notably, our own) protect works, not people – a work written by a Frenchman and published in Japan gets precisely the same protection under US law as something I write and publish in Washington DC.  If Spanish law works that way, then news.google.com is still infringing even after it removes “Spanish” publications, and it is doing so “in Spain” (because its sites can be accessed there).  [If this sounds far-fetched, it's not - this is precisely the kind of "extraterritorial application" of law that the EU, in its official guidelines, has endorsed in regard to the "right to be forgotten."]
That’s not how the international legal system should work, and it will do considerable damage to the free flow of information on the Net if it picks up steam. “Extraterritorial application of law” in this way contravenes very fundamental principles of consensual governance; Google (or anyone else) has to have a way to stay out of Spain and avoid compliance with Spanish, if they don’t like Spanish law.  On the Internet, its application has the potential to kill the goose laying all those golden eggs, and needs to be resisted at all costs.  [And if we are going to apply that fairly, it has to apply in all directions; to oppose Spain's extraterritorial application of its law implies and should imply that we oppose the US's extraterritorial application of its law, on the Internet - but that's the subject for another day].
[Update: Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, over on the Spanish blog Nada es Gratis , has been complaining about the Spanish law for quite some time, and he makes the connection between all this and the economic crisis in Spain:  
The main Spanish media were effectively bankrupt circa 2012 (including the owners of El Pais, El Mundo and La Vanguardia, the three main newspapers) due to the collapse in ad revenue triggered by the financial crisis. At that moment, none of these newspapers were particularly friendly with the conservative government.  The government and the three corporations that owned the newspapers basically struck a deal: the three chiefs editors of the newspapers were replaced (yes, quite amazing) and their news coverage noticeably switched in favor of the government. In exchange, the government passed the regulation (the Google tax) as a way to shakedown Google for money in favor of the media (the ” inalienable” part was to force everyone to comply, they really did not want a newspaper to go solo and accept Google News), it changed the procedure to re-structure debt that was 100% targeted in favor of media companies, plus a few minor other issues. . . . But the political economy of this is clear: it is just a connection between the government and a few media corporations to exploit Google and limit the public access to independent news. Crony capitalism as its worst under the excuse of “copyright”.

The company also plans to expand its product basket by introducing new products which will enhance the growth of livestock by providing balanced nutrition and energy.

Swiss charge black money whistleblower  Herve Falciani with data theftSwitzerland charges Falciani with data theft

Swiss authorities charged a fugitive banking analyst Thursday with data theft in what is considered to be one of the biggest security breaches in the country's often-secretive banking sector.
The case of Herve Falciani , a former employee of global banking group HSBC, has been making headlines in Europe since he fled Switzerland in 2008. He has been accused of stealing stole information between 2006 and 2007 relating to 24,000 customers of the Swiss division of HSBC.
The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland says the data theft charges against the French-Italian national involve stolen bank information transmitted to Lebanese banks, the Paris-based National Directorate of Tax Investigations and other foreign authorities.
Account details were sent to former French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, now head of the International Monetary Fund, who passed them on to U.S. and European Union authorities.
Many of HSBC's Swiss clients became exposed to prosecution for tax evasion - and the leak ratcheted up pressure on Switzerland to crack down on foreign tax cheats.
"Sometimes celebrated as a hero abroad, the Franco-Italian national is now to answer for his alleged crimes before a Swiss court," the Swiss attorney general's office said in a statement. "The Swiss Criminal Procedure Code does not exclude the possibility of holding a court trial of the accused person in absentia."
An international arrest warrant went out for Falciani in 2009. He was arrested in Barcelona in July 2012 after he left France by sea. But Spain's National Court ruled against extraditing him, rejecting the charges Swiss authorities wanted to bring.
The court lifted all restrictions against Falciani, allowing him to leave Spain, and said he was cooperating with investigators from several European countries in probes into tax evasion, money-laundering and terrorism financing.

Ram temple should be built at site of Babri Masjid: Ram Naik20

Ayodhya: Even as a controversy rages over alleged reconversions, Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik on Thursday sparked a fresh row when he said that a Ram temple should be built at the site of Babri Masjid as per the "wishes of Indian citizens".
"Ram Mandir should be built as soon as possible. That is the wish of the Indian citizens and the wish should be fulfilled," he said at the convocation programme of Awadh University at Faizabad, where he was the chief guest.
In November, on a visit to Ayodhya to take part in an event organised by a VHP leader, Naik had said that the vexed issue would be resolved within five years as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is working out a plan to sort it out peacefully.
A former BJP MP, Naik was named the UP governor in July this year after the NDA government came to power at the Centre.
#ram naik #uttar pradesh #babri masjid #temple
"(The) Prime Minister is preparing a plan to work out a peaceful solution to the Ayodhya dispute and it would be solved once and for all within the next five years," Naik had said.
A former BJP MP, Naik was named the UP governor in July this year after the NDA government came to power at the Centre.
Meanwhile, reacting to the remarks by Naik, the oldest litigant in the Babri Masjid case, Hashim Ansari, said, "I have stated earlier that we are ready to come to the negotiation table but before we start talks, the Union government must ensure that the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case must be punished."
He said the trial against them has been lingering for the last 22 years and not a single person has been punished.

Government to Introduce Companies Law Amendment Bill in Lok Sabha on Friday

Modi Government Offers Renewed Sense of Optimism: US Corporate Sector
New Delhi: The government is expected to introduce the bill to make a slew of amendments to the new companies law in the Lok Sabha on Friday.
Most provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, came into effect from April 1 this year and the amendments are mainly aimed at making it easier for corporates to do business.
The amendments to the new companies law were approved by the cabinet earlier this month.
According to the revised list of business for Lok Sabha tomorrow, Corporate Affairs Minister Arun Jaitley is to introduce the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2014.
The Cabinet had cleared 14 proposed amendments, including provision to ensure that frauds beyond a certain threshold need to be mandatorily reported by the auditors to the government.
Besides, the government is looking to relax a number of norms, including those pertaining to related party transactions, while resolutions passed by the companies' boards would not be subjected to public inspection.
The new law, put in place by the previous government, has replaced a nearly six-decade old Companies Act, 1956, but the new government has been indicating for quite some time that it would bring in necessary changes to address concerns raised by various stakeholders.

Taiwanese firm’s decision to shut operations will leave 1,700 employees without work
Chennai, December 11:  
Foxconn, the $130-billion Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, will suspend all operations at its Sriperumbudur plant from December 24, leaving nearly 1,700 employees jobless.
The suspension is due to a change in the facility’s customer base and in manufacturing requirements of customers in India, according to a spokesperson for FIH Mobile Ltd, formerly Foxconn International Holdings.
Two months ago, Nokia suspended its operations at Sriperumbudur. This was a major blow to Tamil Nadu’s image of a being a telecom manufacturing hub. Foxconn’s action will dent the State’s reputation further, said industry sources.
FIH, the world’s largest maker of mobile phones, for big brands such as Nokia, had invested over $100 million in its Sriperumbudur plant.
The facility was commissioned in 2006 to manufacture printed circuit boards and telecom components. “We can confirm that our India operation, FIH India Private Ltd, will be suspending all operations at our manufacturing facility in Chennai effective December 24,” said a spokesperson for FIH Mobile Ltd.
Taking action
“We are working with the government and the relevant labour unions to ensure that this action is carried out in a manner that follows all relevant laws and regulations and is fair to the approximately 1,700 employees who will be affected by this move,” the company said. The suspension of the plant’s activity is also related to a restructuring of its India operations, which, the company says, is designed to ensure that it is able to meet both current and future needs of customers.
“We will continue to consider investments in manufacturing operations in India when they make sense commercially and when they are consistent with the needs of our customers. Details regarding any new investments will only be announced once decisions have been made and all necessary approvals received,” it said.
The Foxconn facility saw some labour unrest in 2010.

Uber apologises  to revamp processes; Offer refund to consumers using Paytm walletUber apologises, to revamp processes; Offer refund to consumers using Paytm wallet

Mumbai, Dec 11:  
Days after it was slammed, ridiculed and banned following rape of a woman in Delhi by an Uber driver, the global cab booking firm has sent out apology mail to its customer saying that it will take stringent measures to ensure passenger’s safety as priority. The San Francisco-based technology company was yesterday banned from operating its services in New Delhi.
In a personalised letter, Uber India has said, “We are sorry and deeply saddened by what happened over the weekend in New Delhi. Our hearts go out to the victim of this horrible crime. We have been and will continue to do everything in our power to assist the authorities to help bring the perpetrator to justice.”
The last five days have been very tumultuous for the company after it faced public outrage for not taking any responsibility of the incident. The company, which entered the Indian market a year-ago by disrupting the taxi services market, was also accused of violating certain road and transport rules and regulations.
“The week has made us reflect on our operations in India and we are immediately undertaking a number of important actions. During this review, we will suspend operations in New Delhi,” the letter said.
Terming that India is an important market for Uber, the company said that it would conduct full audit of verification, rider feedback and support processes besides implementing measures to ensure that critical rider feedback is escalated immediately and immediate action is taken in every instance. It is also re-reviewing rider feedback on every driver partner across India to make sure nothing has been missed.
The company is evaluating additional screening options to include background checks on all drivers in India above and beyond what is currently required and would partner closely with organisations that are working towards women’s safety in the country.
Uber is a mobile-based application that connects drivers and customers directly on its digital platform. Uber’s website and mobile app has pictures of women seeking cabs, which also shows that women are target customers. “Safety is our top priority. We are investing in technology advances to help make cities a safer place. Your support means a lot to us. We will come back better and stronger for the New Delhi community, ready to serve you again,” it added.
Meanwhile, it has urged all its customers, who have stored money in its digital wallet, can get it refunded or credited in their bank accounts. Uber had tied up with payment solution provider Paytm for all transactions happening on its application in the country.

India Inc will reduce borrowing by refinancing debt: RBS headIndia Inc will reduce borrowing by refinancing debt: RBS head
Our Bureau
Tweet
Mumbai, December 11:  
India Inc is likely to see a significant number of refinancing transactions in calendar year 2015 to reduce its cost of borrowing by refinancing its debt, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS).
Manmohan Singh, MD and Head of Debt Capital Markets, India and South East Asia, RBS, said, “Current equity market performance has moved financial institutions to concentrate on equity market issuance. We expect them to focus on debt post the same.”
RBS anticipates faster growth and boost in capex as fiscal health is likely to improve after decision making on reduction of subsidies by the Government. Singh said interest rates would ease during the first half of 2015 and this would lead to another organic expansion and market for multiple products.
Balanced approach
“We understand RBI’s balanced approach towards ECB norms and recent clarification on withholding tax will lead to many corporate issuers gaining advantage via accessing international bond markets,” Singh added.
Indian issuers have seen significant spread compression (lowest spreads in recent few years) and the decisive election mandate has further improved its standing across investor classes. All eyes will be on the 2015 budget and any roadmap to reduce deficit and impetus to the economy would lead to more significant participation by foreign investors. Deregulation of diesel prices and softening of crude prices are catalysts for improving the financial health and economy of the country. However, RBS expects international crude prices to stabilise shortly.
Emergence of alternate regional currencies, such as SGD (Singapore Dollar) and CNH (Chinese Yuan), provide greater distribution and arbitrage opportunities for international and regional issuers.

Bar bribes: Kerala Opposition seeks to confront Finance Minister with evidenceBar bribes: Kerala Opposition seeks to confront Finance Minister with evidence
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Dec 1:  
The Opposition in the Kerala Assembly sought to confront the Finance Minister, KM Mani, with evidence in an alleged case of bribery involving him and a bar owner.
But Deputy Speaker N Sakthan warned the Deputy Leader of Opposition, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, that he cannot table any evidence without the Speakers’ permission.
Adjournment motion
Earlier, piloting an adjournment motion, Balakrishnan managed to convince Sakthan, who was in Chair, that the House stop the business to discuss the bribery charge.
He produced a CD which he claimed contained related visuals depicting the handover of money in two tranches at 6.30 am on April 2 at the Minister’s official residence.
On being warned by the Deputy Speaker, he demanded that the Government order a probe into the matter in which its Finance Minister has not exactly covered himself with glory.
The probe should also examine the trail of phone calls made by office-bearers of the bar association and also conduct an audit of their bank accounts.
KB Ganesh Kumar, an MLA from the ruling coalition, must be allowed as requested by him to reveal what he has to say in the matter on the floor of the House.
CM's stance
Last, but not the least, the probe should also seek to find out why the Chief Minister, Oommen Chandy, has overtly been trying to shield the Finance Minister.
Kodiyeri also demanded that the Government table the minutes of the Cabinet meeting that discussed the new excise policy to clear the air on who spoke for and against the controversial policy stand that aims at prohibition in phases.
Earlier, he had alleged that the driver of the car bearing registration number KL01B 7878 had delivered Rs 15 lakh in cash at Mani’s official residence here.
He was followed by two others who handed over Rs 35 lakh, he said, even as the Finance Minister listened out to him keenly from his seat in the Treasury Benches.

Insurance Bill: House panel for raising foreign investment cap to 49%Rajeev Bhatt Parliament House…The Government is likely to bring the Bill for consideration of the Upper House as early as next week.
New Delhi, Dec 10:  
A Parliamentary Committee today recommended a composite foreign investment cap of 49 per cent in the insurance sector and supported a government Bill to amend the Act.
At present, a limit of 26 per cent is allowed only through the FDI route.
“The committee recommends that the composite cap of 49 per cent should be inclusive of all forms of foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investments,” said the report tabled in the Rajya Sabha.
The Rajya Sabha had in August appointed a 15-member Select Committee to scrutinise the long pending Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008. The Bill was held up for nearly six years on account of political differences.
The Government is likely to bring the Bill for consideration of the Upper House as early as next week.
The panel report, however, contains dissent notes from four members — P Rajeev (CPI—M), Derek O’Brien (TMC), Ram Gopal Yadav (SP) and KC Tyagi (JDU).
The panel, headed by Rajya Sabha MP Chandan Mitra, has suggested inclusion of a person from the insurance industry in the Securities Appellate Tribunal as an expert.
It has recommended suitable amendment to the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act for the inclusion.
The panel also recommended that penalties on insurance companies be linked to seriousness of offences committed by them. It has suggested mechanism to ensure that there is minimum scope for subjective interpretation.
The Standing Committee on Finance headed by senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha in 2011 had rejected the proposal to hike FDI to 49 per cent in the insurance sector, saying it may not have the desired effect and could expose the economy to global vulnerability.
The Select Committee has unanimously agreed not to bring down the paid-up equity capital in the health insurance sector as compared to the life and general insurance.
The panel suggested that the capital requirements may be retained at the Rs 100—crore level to ensure health insurers have adequate capacity for providing critical services to citizens, and it also pitched for giving top priority to this segment.
“The insurance Bill be passed,” the Committee said, adding the government may take more measures as recommended by it.
The committee suggested that the Law Ministry and the insurance regulator IRDA should modify the definition of the term “nominee” in order to remove any ambiguity. The Supreme Court had suggested that there was no need for two categories of nominees —— beneficiary nominee and collector nominee.
It also recommended that adequate protective mechanism be instituted to ensure agents get their commission and the commission structure be determined by IRDA on market conditions.

Facts about Nobel prizesNobel Peace Prize 2014 winners: Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai
Stockholm, Dec 10:  
From 1901 till this year, Nobel prizes have been awarded 567 times to 864 Laureates and 25 organisations with the youngest winner being Peace Prize awardee Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan at 17 years.
By winning the Peace Nobel at this tender age along with India’s Kailash Satyarthi, Yousafzai beat the previous record of Lawrence Bragg, who won the Physics Nobel in 1915 at the age of 25.
Average age
The average age of all Nobel Laureates in all prize categories between 1901 and 2014 is 59 years.
Common birthdays
Two most common birthdays among the Nobel Laureates are May 21 and February 28.
The word “Laureate” signifies the laurel wreath awarded to winners of athletic competitions and poetic meets in Ancient Greece.
In Greek mythology, god Apollo is represented wearing on his head a laurel wreath, a circular crown made of branches and leaves of the bay laurel.
Since 1901, prizes have not been awarded 50 times, most of them during World War I (1914-1918) and II (1939-1945).
The statutes of the Nobel Foundation say, “If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year.”
“If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation’s restricted funds.”
Alfred Nobel will
On 27 November 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament, giving the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and Peace.
In 1968, Sweden’s central bank Sveriges Riksbank established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in memory of Nobel.
Oldest Nobel recipient
Leonid Hurwicz has the distinction of being the oldest Nobel recipient at the age of 90 for Economics in 2007.
Women awardees
Till now, 47 women have won the Nobel while two Laureates declined the prize.
Jean-Paul Sartre, awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature, declined it as he had consistently declined all official honours.
Le Duc Tho, awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for negotiating the Vietnam peace accord, said he was not in a position to accept the award, citing the situation in Vietnam as his reason.
Four Laureates were forced by authorities to decline the Nobel.
Adolf Hitler forbade three Germans Richard Kuhn, Adolf Butenandt and Gerhard Domagk, from accepting the Nobel Prize.
They, however, received the Nobel Prize Diploma and Medal later but not the prize amount.
Boris Pasternak, the 1958 Nobel Laureate in Literature, initially accepted the Prize but was later coerced by authorities of his native country the Soviet Union to decline the award.
Three Peace Laureates — Germany’s Carl von Ossietzky, Myanmar’s pro-democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi and Chinese rights activist Liu Xiaobo — were under arrest at the time of the award.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was given the Nobel Peace Prize thrice while its founder Henry Dunant won the first Peace Prize in 1901.
Linus Pauling has the distinction of being the only person to have been awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes — the 1954 Prize in Chemistry and the 1962 Peace Prize.
At the Nobel Award ceremonies on December 10, the Laureates receive three things: a Nobel Diploma, a Nobel Medal and a document confirming the Nobel Prize amount.
Each Nobel Diploma is a unique work of art, created by foremost Swedish and Norwegian artists and calligraphers.
The Nobel Medals are handmade with careful precision and in 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold.
Prize amount
The Nobel Prize amount for 2014 is set at Swedish kronor (SEK) 8.0 million per full Nobel Prize.

Welcome home the connected futureWelcome home the connected future
Vinay Kamath
Magic mirror: The smart mirrors can show you how your clothes would look under different lighting conditions, or give suggestions. PRATAP PADODE
We experience Panasonic’s offerings to the $100-billion smart home market
Imagine a kitchen where you can ‘order’ the kettle to boil water or have a dialogue with your cooking range. Or, a smart mirror that can tell you how your clothes will look under bright sunlight or indoors. Or, and this is probably scarier, a bed that tells you how loudly you’re snoring or the heavy breathing you do when asleep. These interactive gadgets are not in the realm of the future as consumer goods giant Panasonic has developed and is testing these concepts even as it looks to take it to market by 2020.
Visiting the Wonder Life-Box 2020 at the Panasonic Centre in Tokyo was quite a revelation then. A guided tour takes you through the cloud-based technologies that Panasonic has developed for home appliances and equipment, which it says will be all part of a smart home a few years hence.
All around the house
The new tech begins at the gate with what it calls as smart locker service. You don’t have to wait interminably for a delivery boy to come, whether it’s a pizza or ice cream. In the future, the courier person will come equipped with a smart card with pre-loaded details obtained via the cloud. Flashing it on a reader, an appropriate locker opens up, a freezer box if it’s fresh produce, or if it’s a book, in another locker at room temperature. The lockers can maintain three different temperatures. When you’re home, you can open the lockers, even from the inside, and take your purchase.
Then there’s the entrance to the house. Visitors don’t need a key if you aren’t at home. Facial recognition tech in the camera can match information with a pre-registered list of approved visitors in the cloud to open the door automatically. As our English-speaking Japanese guide points out, it makes home visits easier even when nobody is at home or if an elderly patient is in bed.
We are led into a futuristic kitchen, a web of cameras, projectors and microphones. Many functions are voice-activated. Want to make a gourmet dish? At your command, a cloud-enabled projector searches for a recipe and, presto, projects it on to the kitchen counter. What’s more, your voice can order the tap to fill the kettle to the brim and another command can set it to boil! It sure makes cooking more fun.
In the living room, you can flop down in front of your TV and have a conversation. Built-in voice activation tech will enable you to find and book a travel destination through the TV or you can even book a table at a new restaurant for a nice meal.
We’re upstairs now, in a smart bathroom. You can measure your body weight, body fat percentage and heart rate just by standing in front of the mirror. It checks your health every day with data stored, where else, but on the cloud. If you’re not a bit unnerved by a mirror that tells the naked truth, try the bedroom. GPS sensors can project a star-lit night on the ceiling. Roof-mounted sensors can measure your body temperature, how often you roll over, how loudly you snore and breathe whilst you sleep.
As our guide points out, “data is then managed in the cloud to provide support for home care or health treatment at home.” Talk about hi-tech home remedies.
Tech for vanity
Then there’s the ‘magic’ mirror. With mere gestures it can change the colour of your clothes and also show you how your clothes will look at different times of the day, in bright sunlight or in indoor light. The mirror can also offer make-up suggestions based on the colour of one’s clothes. And, one can change accordingly.
After that smart home visit, one needed some steaming coffee, half expecting a robotic arm to help you sip your cup. The future beckons.

Industry seeks clarity and stability in tax policy
Special Correspondent
economy (general)
Demands excise duty concessions on certain goods up to mid-March next
In pre-budget consultations with Revenue Secretary Shaktikanta Das and other officers of the Finance Ministry on Wednesday, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) emphasised the need for the government to implement steps for reviving the economy. It also demanded a bunch of tax concessions.
The CII demanded simplicity, clarity and stability in the tax policy regime and technology based e-governance initiatives on procedural simplification at the meeting, according to a press release.
To boost the investor sentiment, the CII demanded that the government take the ‘Make in India’ initiative to a new level and galvanise the economy to a higher and inclusive growth path.
The CII team was led by past President Arun Bharat Ram. He stated that the CII was deliberating in a constructive manner on the possible solutions for fundamental design issues on Goods and Services Tax (GST) and asked for opportunities for regular interaction with the officials dealing with the reform.
Anomalies in customs duty
The industry chamber recommended that the government remove anomalies in customs duty and halve the Central Sales Tax rate from 2 per cent to 1 per cent to compensate for the delay in the implementation of the GST. It also demanded that the government extend the excise duty concessions on certain goods to March 15, 2015. In the Union budget 2014-15, this reduction in the range of 2 per cent-6 per cent was provided up to December 31, 2014.
It also demanded that investment allowance should be extended to the infrastructure sector to further spur investment activity in the economy. Further infrastructure companies should be exempted from paying the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).
“MAT on SEZs should be abolished. Similarly, the government should do away with the dividend distribution tax at SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) level to make REITs attractive,” said one of the members in the CII delegation.

Now you can hail a private jet with your smartphone
Wannabe jetsetters can now hail a private plane anywhere in the world from their smartphones thanks to an app that makes luxury air travel more accessible, at least to those who can afford the $7,000 membership.
JetSmarter, the brain child of Sergey Petrossov, 26, allows users to hire a jet in a matter of seconds. "Our goal as a company is to democratize private aviation," he told Reuters in Zurich, where the company will open a European office in 2015.
0
Launched in March last year, the app has been downloaded over 300,000 times and facilitated more than 1,000 flights so far in 2014.
While the average ticket costs around $20,000, those who become members for $7,000 a year can get free or discounted "empty legs" flights, which travel empty when a plane returns to its home base after dropping off passengers,
The average JetSmarter member is tech-savvy, aged between 25 and 50 and earns at least $1 million a year, according to Petrossov. A-list celebrities, royalty and sheiks are among its users.
Some of the most popular routes include the "Golden Triangle" between Miami, New York and Los Angeles. But almost anything is possible. JetSmarter once received a request to transport a ton of gold between South America and Europe.

Housing s Millennial Mismatch21%
24%
Note: among 100 largest metros. Population shares based on 2013 Census population estimates. To download the list of asking home price changes for the largest metros: Excel or PDF
To see how the age distribution of a metro's population relates to home prices, we identified the 10 markets with the highest shares of each of four distinct generations: millennials (age 20-34); Gen X (age 35-49); boomers (age 50-69); and seniors (age 70 and up). (See note.) In the 10 markets where millennials account for the largest share of the population, including Austin , San Diego and Virginia Beach-Norfolk, the average year-over-year price increase was 6.1 percent -- below the 7.4 percent national increase. Markets with the highest shares of Gen Xers, including Raleigh , San Francisco and San Jose , averaged price increases of 9.4 percent -- highest among the four age groups. Prices in the favorite markets of seniors, most of which are in Florida, rose 8.6 percent -- also above the national increase.
The Millennial Mismatch in Housing Affordability
When young adult renters are asked if they will buy a home someday, a whopping 93 percent say yes. You'd think it would be good news for them that prices are rising more slowly in the markets where they currently live. Not so fast though. Prices might be rising more slowly in millennials' favorite metros. But affordability is nonetheless a big challenge in those markets.
To see this, compare the millennial population share in each metro with the percentage of homes for sale that a typical millennial household can afford (from our most recent Middle Class Affordability report -- see note below on how we define affordability). In metros with higher millennial shares, homeownership tends to be less affordable for this group. For instance, in Austin, Honolulu, New York and San Diego, 20-34 year-olds account for at least 23.5 percent of the population, putting those metros in the top 10 for millennial share. But fewer than 30 percent of homes for sale in those markets are within reach of the typical millennial household. Some markets with a high millennial share are more affordable, including Oklahoma City and Baton Rouge , but they're the exception (see note).
Call it the "millennial mismatch." Millennials can afford markets where they don't live, but they can't afford many of the markets where they do live. Many millennials who hope to buy someday will be priced out of the market where they live now. They'll face a tough choice: Do they keep renting or move to a cheaper market?
Rents Gains Easing Slightly in Most Large Markets
Rents continued to climb. Nationwide, rents rose 6.1 percent year-over-year in November. Still, rent gains have cooled since August in 14 of the 25 largest rental markets, including the Northern California markets of San Francisco, Oakland and Sacramento. In November, Denver had the steepest increases in the country, though the typical two-bedroom unit there still rents for less than half of what it would cost in San Francisco or New York. But rent increases could slow next year if new apartment construction finally catches up with demand.

Google News to shut down in Spain over  Google TaxUpdated: December 11, 2014 09:52 IST
Google News to shut down in Spain over 'Google Tax'
AP
company information
Google said Thursday it will shut down its Google News service in Spain to prevent publishers’ content from appearing on it ahead of a new law requiring the Internet search company to pay Spanish news organizations for linked content or snippets of news.
The move marks the first time globally that Google Inc. will shutter Google News and comes ahead of a new Spanish intellectual property law going into effect Jan. 1 nicknamed the “Google Tax.”
The company’s News product for Spain will stop linking content from Spanish publishers and close on Dec. 16, Google said in a statement.
The law did not specify how much publishers would have to be paid by Google. Spain’s AEDE group of news publishers lobbied for the law nicknamed the “Google Tax” and Google said publishers would be forced to charge the company “for showing even the smallest snippets of their content whether they want to charge or not.”
“As Google News shows no ads and makes no revenue, this approach is simply unsustainable,” Google said.
Google News has long rankled newspaper publishers and other content providers who contend the service tramples on copyrights by creating a digital kiosk of headlines and story snippets gathered from other websites.
Most venting has been limited to criticism likening Google to a freeloader, but there have been attempts to force the company to change its ways through courts.
Google maintains it obeys all copyright laws while sending more people to websites highlighted in its News services. The company also allows publishers to prevent material from being displayed in Google News, an option few websites choose because the service is an important traffic source to sell ads.
After Germany revised copyright laws last year in a way that could have required Google News to make royalty payments, Google required publishers to give consent for summarizing content and most did.
Europe’s highest court this year ruled that people have a right to scrub unflattering or outdated information from Google’s search engine. That case started in Spain.

SBI chief proposes differential voting rights to meet Basel-III normsSBI chief proposes differential voting rights to meet Basel-III norms
PTI
SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya
New Delhi, Dec 11:  
With the government indicating that it won’t continue to fund public sector banks (PSBs), SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya today said they could look at issuing shares with differential voting rights to raise funds for meeting the Basel-III capital adequacy norms.
“The writing on the wall is very clear...they (PSBs) have to think of differential voting rights. It is time to lay out some kind of roadmap on how much the banks need to do and how much support it would get,” she said, while talking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference.
The government had yesterday allowed PSBs to raise up to Rs 1.6 lakh crore from markets by diluting the government holding to 52 per cent in phases to meet Basel III norms.
Consolidation
Pitching for consolidation in the banking sector, Bhattacharya said that it was important to have three to four major banks.
“It is extremely important for India to have 3-4 major banks. ... We should allow the banks to come together and talk among themselves. In the past also, we have seen government has forced some mergers...it is very important for the banks to determine who should be their correct partners,” she added.
According to Bhattacharya, “it is better to merge good banks with good banks.”
Stake dilution
She further said the government has shown its intent to continue with reforms in the banking sector by deciding to bring down its stake to 52 per cent.
“The news that the government has allowed PSBs to bring down government stake to 52 per cent kicks off the next round of reforms... because for the first time clear signal has been given (to PSBs) to source capital from the market.
“The big daddy back there is not going to be around to give them capital as and when they need. If they need to be competitive and want to grow, then they definitely need to look at other places for more capital,” Bhattacharya added.
Out of 27 PSBs, the Government of India controls 22 through majority holding. In the remaining five, state-run SBI holds majority stake.
Basel III norms
The Basel III norms, which will come into effect from March 31, 2019, were put in place following the 2007-08 financial crisis triggered by the fall of Lehman Brothers.
The norms are aimed at improving risk management and governance, while raising the banking sector’s ability to absorb financial and economic stress.
As per Basel-III norms, the minimum capital level for Tier-1 has to be 7 per cent.

Donates two training cars, diagnostic units
Pune, Dec 11:  
Mercedes Benz India has donated two new training cars and the latest Star diagnostic units to two Government Polytechnic institutes in Maharashtra.
The German luxury car maker has been supporting an advanced one-year-long Mechatronics programme it has developed for these institutes to help students keep pace with advancement in automotive technology, and develop skilled manpower.
Today the Govt Polytechnic Pune received the keys to a third Mercedes C-Class sedan, while the Govt Polytechnic Aurangabad got its second such car from the Company.
“In the service area, we are growing at a CAGR of 30%, and the demand for trained manpower is so high that there is a fight for them,” Eberhard Kern, MD and CEO, MBI said. The Company has trained 370 students since the inception of the course in 2006, and absorbed nearly half of them in their workshop and service outlets.

Russia to set up 12 nuclear units in IndiaRussia to set up 12 nuclear units in India
IANS | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 06:06 PM IST
India and Russia Thursday took a major step forward in their civil nuclear energy co-operation with both sides inking a strategic vision document for the construction of 12 new nuclear power units in India over the next two decades as Prime Minister Narendra Modi held summit talks with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin here.
The two sides inked 16 agreements, including in the spheres of defence co-operation, oil and gas and in trade, after the holding of the 15th India-Russia annual summit.
Modi, reading out a statement after the talks, said both sides have outlined an "ambitious vision for nuclear energy of at least 10 more reactors".
Putin, who read out his statement after Modi, said Russia and India have signed an important statement on nuclear energy cooperation and Russia would set up "20 nuclear units" in India and also co-operate in uranium mining.
According to the vision document on nuclear energy cooperation: "The two sides have decided to fast-track the implementation of agreed cooperation projects for nuclear power plants. Both Sides will strive to complete the construction and commissioning of not less than 12 units in the next two decades."
India has agreed to "expeditiously identify a second site, in addition to Kudankulam, for the construction of the Russian-designed nuclear power units in India. The sides will join their expertise and resources to minimise the total cost and time of construction of nuclear power units", it said.
In the field of hydrocarbons, too, both sides inked agreements for India to scout for oil and gas in the resource rich Arctic Shelf.
Modi said India, despite being one of the world's largest importers of hydrocarbons, has not cooperated enough in this setor. "Today, we have made a new start with a few important agreements. But we will set an ambitious agenda for partnership in oil and gas," said Modi.
Putin said Russian energy behemoths Rosneft and Gazprom would join up with Indian companies to scout for oil and gas in the Arctic Shelf.
Defence was another area that saw both sides enhancing cooperation.
Modi said Russia has been "India's foremost defence partner through decades" and mentioned the refitted Russian aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya as a "great symbol" of bilateral defence cooperation.
"Even as India's options have increased today, Russia will remain our most important defence partner," he said.
India imports around 70 percent of its defence requirements from Russia, but has been looking at other countries, including Israel and the US, for its weaponry.
He said the two sides had discussed a broad range of new defence projects and how to "align our defence relations to India's own priorities including Make in India".
The Prime Minister said Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters, with the possibility of exports from India. The helicopter can be used for both military and civilian use.
Modi also proposed that Russia should locate its defence spares and components manufacturing facilities in India and added that Putin had "responded very positively" to the request.
Getting Russian spares for defence equipment purchased earlier by India has been a major headache for India.
Modi thanked Russia for its support in building closer relations with the Russia-led Eurasia Economic Union.
Modi also conveyed his condolences at the loss of lives in a terror attack in Chechnya last week.

 Sensex  Nifty Close at Six-Week Low as Oil Firms SkidL&T, Bhel Gain After Robust HSBC PMI Manufacturing Data
Mumbai: The BSE Sensex fell for a fourth session in five to end at its lowest close in six weeks, with oil explorers leading the declines as global crude prices continued to tumble, while blue-chips such as Infosys were hurt by profit-taking.
Falls also tracked lower Asian shares as the slide in oil added to global growth concerns. Adding to that was heavy selling by foreign investors in domestic derivatives on Wednesday, who unwound positions worth Rs 1,915 crore ($307.3 million), exchange data showed.
Investors are now looking ahead to consumer inflation data due on Friday. A Reuters poll of 36 economists forecast that retail inflation cooled to an annual rate of 4.50 per cent, marking their lowest on record because of falling food and fuel prices.
"Mark-to-market payouts in global ETF portfolios forced them (FIIs) to sell their global positions. Fall in the rupee also forced them to offload India portfolios," said Deven Choksey, managing director at brokerage KR Choksey.
The Sensex fell 0.82 per cent to 27,602.01, while the Nifty ended 0.75 per cent lower at 8,292.90. Both indexes closed at their lowest level since October 30.
Lower oil prices hit Gail (India), which closed down 2.41 per cent. Jefferies said lower crude prices could have an adverse impact due to the company's petrochemical and LPG businesses.
Other oil explorers including Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Reliance Industries Ltd fell 3.23 per cent and 2.83 per cent respectively.
Electrical and power distribution equipment manufacturer Havells India Ltd tumbled 9.61 per cent after the company cut its standalone revenue outlook.
Software services exporter Infosys Ltd, which has gained over 25 per cent since May, fell 2.2 per cent as investors took profits on continued weakness in the company's share price after its founders sold stock worth $1.1 billion earlier this week.
Hindustan Unilever Ltd, which has gained about 3 per cent in the last two weeks, also fell on profit-taking.
Among the gainers, telecom tower company Bharti Infratel ended up 5 per cent as analysts expect continued 3G rollouts will help it achieve higher rental income.

Sugar stocks up on higher ethanol priceSugar stocks up on higher ethanol price
Dilip Kumar Jha | Mumbai Dec 11, 2014 10:33 PM IST
Sugar stocks rose by up to 15 per cent on Thursday, after an increase in the base prices of ethanol was cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).
The share price of Riga Sugar jumped 14.7 per cent to close at Rs 12.16. Simbhaoli Sugars and Rajshree Sugar rose 12.8 per cent and 7.8 per cent, respectively, ending at Rs 15.96 and Rs 24.20. Balrampur Chini and Bajaj Hindusthan posted a 4.9 per cent and 4.5 per cent increase to Rs 61.55 and Rs 21.95, respectively. Shree Renuka Sugars jumped 4.1 per cent to Rs 17.55.
The government’s decision to raise base prices of ethanol by Rs 1.50-2 a litre will, say analysts, accelerate the petrol-ethanol blending programme. Which is seen as  a big help for sugar companies’ financial health.
“There were lots of uncertainties in ethanol prices. With the selling price known, sugar mills will be able to produce more ethanol and convert raw material for surplus sugar to produce ethanol. Through this, excess sugar inventory will come down, in addition to improved supply of ethanol,” said Narendra Murkumbi, managing director of Shree Renuka Sugars, one of India’s largest ethanol producers and suppliers.
Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma) has estimated a total surplus of 7.5 million tonnes in the 2013-14 crushing season 2013-14 (October–September), of which 2.5 mt was categorised as exportable surplus.
Depending upon the distance of oil marketing companies’ (OMCs) retail depot from a sugar factory, the CCEA fixed the ethanol supply price at Rs 48.50 a litre for a depot between 0-100 kms, Rs 49 a litre for 101-200 km, Rs 49.50 a litre for 201-300 km and Rs 50 a litre for a depot over 300 km. This is Rs 1.50-2 a litre higher than the previously negotiated procurement price. It has been linked to the Centre’s recommended Fair & Remunerative Price for cane, though many states have set their own, higher, State Advised Price.
Abinash Verma, director-general of Isma, said: “The industry welcomes the decision of the government to bring transparency and simplify the procedures to finalise ethanol contracts and supplies thereof. Linking the ethanol price to the sugarcane price will directly benefit the farmers. The industry is required to pass on 70 per cent of the revenue from primary byproducts and, therefore, this move will also mean higher revenue to  farmers.”
The industry expects quicker finalisation of contracts because of the fixed pricing system and faster and smoother movement of ethanol within and across states, with OMCs entering into agreements with states to get annual excise permits for ethanol.
“Overall, this decision will mean a successful ethanol blending programme and a quicker movement to a higher blending percentage. Five per cent ethanol blending will save foreign exchange of $800 million, equivalent to Rs 5,000 crore,” said Verma.
According to an OMC official, India has achieved only 1.33 per cent of ethanol blending so far. A five per cent blending target requires 1,200 million litres of ethanol this year.

Chaos in Karnataka Assembly over BJP MLA gazing at Priyanka Gandhi s picChaos in Karnataka Assembly over BJP MLA gazing at Priyanka Gandhi's pic
Press Trust of India | Belagavi Dec 11, 2014 08:41 PM IST
Karnataka Assembly was on Thursday adjourned briefly amid chaos over a BJP MLA watching a zoomed in picture of Priyanka Gandhi on his mobile phone during House proceedings.
As the House assembled, slogan shouting Congress members rushed to the front row of seats, demanding strict action against Prabhu Chavan for the “indecent act” on Wednesday. The members said Chavan’s “unacceptable” conduct had hurt the dignity of their leader and demanded action against him.
Chavan was caught on TV camera watching a zoomed in photo of Priyanka Gandhi on his mobile phone and another BJP MLA U B Banakar was found playing video games, oblivious of the discussion about the plight of sugarcane growers to whom sugar mill owners owe huge arrears.
As the incident left the BJP red-faced, he had later said he zoomed in the picture of Priyanka Gandhi only to read a slogan below but admitted that it was a “mistake” to have taken the mobile phone inside the House.
Raising the issue, Law and Parliamentary Minister T B Jayachandra demanded action against Chavan and sought a permanent solution to prevent recurrence of such incidents. The Minister said the incident has not only tarnished the image of the two legislators, but also that of the legislature.
The matter has gained serious proportions as it has reached the portals of the Parliament where the issue might come up for discussion and such an incident has hurt the sentiments of the legislators, Jayachandra said. Opposition BJP Leader Jagadish Shettar demanded that the Chair put an end to such incidents and curb the use of mobile phones in the House.
Admitting the folly made by his party legislator, Shettar requested Speaker Kagodu Thimappa to allow the member to issue a statement in the House. He said the act has maligned the image of public representatives.
Before adjourning the House for ten minutes, Thimmappa requested Congress members to take their seats and resume proceedings as Chavan had apologised “with tears in his eyes” in his chamber.
“The legislator visited me and apologised for the incident and shed tears. I think it will be appropriate that the members resume their seats and allow the House to function,” he said.

Oil Slips Towards $64, Oversupply Weighs
Reuters | Updated On: December 11, 2014 20:35 (IST)
Jet Fuel Rates Cut Sharply by 12.5%
London: Oil slipped towards $64 a barrel on Thursday and within sight of a five-year low, pressured by signs that already ample supply will be even more plentiful in 2015.
Crude prices sank on Wednesday as OPEC forecast an increasing supply surplus in 2015, US crude inventories unexpectedly rose and OPEC's most influential voice, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, shrugged off the need for an output cut.
North Sea Brent crude gave up an earlier gain and was down 1 cent at $64.23 by 1450 GMT. It fell to $63.56 - the weakest since July 2009 - on Wednesday. US crude, which also hit a five-year low on Wednesday, lost 21 cents to $60.73.
"We may see some technical bounces, but it is too soon to speak of a sustainable price recovery," said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank, which on Thursday cut its 2015 Brent price forecast to $73 a barrel from $82.
Brent has fallen more than 40 per cent, or $50, from its 2014 high reached in June and others in the market say the losing streak could have further to run.
Christopher Bellew, a senior oil broker at Jefferies in London, said the outlook remained bearish. "It would be unwise to say the market has marked the bottom," he said.
Earlier in the session, oil and other dollar-denominated commodities were supported by a weak dollar. The dollar later rebounded after official figures showed US retail sales rose in November.
OPEC said on Wednesday demand for its crude in 2015 would fall to its lowest in more than a decade, indicating a large supply surplus in 2015 without OPEC output cuts or a slowdown in the US shale boom.
The prospect of any OPEC cut remained slim as Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, on Wednesday questioned the need for one, sticking to his stance outlined at OPEC's meeting on Nov. 27 despite a $13 drop in prices since then.
A US-based trader said Naimi's comments were continuing to weigh on prices on Thursday.
At the OPEC meeting, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies urged fellow OPEC members to combat the growth in US shale, which needs relatively high prices to be economic and has been eroding OPEC's market share, by resisting output curbs.

40 Years Ago...And now: Putting the lighting effects back on Philips40 years ago...And now: Putting the lighting effects back on Philips
Sounak Mitra | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 09:26 PM IST
"When it's Philips, You're Sure" ran the tagline in the eighties for its consumer products. But consumers may have been forgiven for being unsure about a company that had, 17 years before independence, provided light bulbs to Indian homes (at least, those that could afford electricity).
By then, the Netherlands-based Indian subsidiary was steadily losing market share in almost all its core businesses owing to the entry of domestic and foreign competition as a result of Rajiv Gandhi's partial liberalisation. The end of its monopoly came at a time when the company, headquartered in Bombay, as it was then known, faced growing labour problems in its Bengal factories. Globally, too, its Dutch parent, a pioneer in the analogue age, was struggling to innovate in the digital times.
In many ways, Philips' fluctuating fortunes in India reflected the ups and downs of Indian economic policy and its name change was one index of this. Starting as Philips Electricals Co (India) Ltd, a subsidiary of Philips & Co in 1930, the name changed to Philips India Pvt Ltd in 1956 when the first industrial policy was framed and the company went public. In 1979, in response to changes in foreign exchange regulation, it changed its name to Pieco Electronics & Electricals Ltd from Philips India Ltd. A few years later, it renamed itself Philips India Limited, a subsidiary of Royal Philips of the Netherlands.
Along the way several product lines were jettisoned, sound systems being one of them. Over the years, the company cut down its operations - from 12 factories to just two in 2002, though later adding three more. It sold its Kolkata factory that used to make televisions to home-grown Videocon, delisted in 2004, and finally outsourced television manufacturing to Videocon in 2010. And, now, Philips does not sell televisions; it used to be a household name across India in TV's black-and-white era and in the early years of colour. It could not keep up with the feisty Japanese and Korean brands, price disruptors par excellence.
This slippage was also because Philips did not respond to organisational change, and had high overheads. Rajeev Karwal, who was picked to head the consumer business in the early-2000s, after his success at LG, recalls feeling like "a true blue- blood" when he joined. At headquarters, tea was served in a silver service in a guesthouse that was a mansion originally owned by former royal family, the Scindias of Gwalior.
Over the past few years and several rethinks later, the company finally found a focus and a positioning. There is lighting, healthcare, and consumer lifestyle which is fast growing for Philips.
Throughout, Philips has tried to reinvigorate the brand from time to time. Big bang advertising campaigns, followed by a slew of launches such as plasma TVs, in 1998, could not bring back its fortunes. Low-margin products such as DVD and MP3 players and low-end home appliances also did not work out. Revenue from consumer electronics continued to fall - from about 42 per cent in 2005 to 28 per cent in 2010. But for some products, like bulbs and tube-lights, people believed that Philips brought quality, and still remain loyal to the brand.
Philips is now trying to make its focus on lighting business work. "The mandate is to build the future for Philips in India," says Krishna Kumar, who took over as vice-chairman and managing director at Philips India a year back.
According to Krishna, Philips started with lighting about 124 years back globally, which took the company in two key directions. "Healthcare as a division was started from imaging, which can't be done without light. In 1980s, globally, Philips decided to have a purpose around our innovations. Before that we were very broad and deep. So, defining the core purpose was the key. And, we decided to deliver meaningful innovations that improve people's lives with a vision to improve the lives of the 3 billion people in the world by 2025."
"Between 2008 and 2013, Philips India has been growing at 24 per cent in revenues. We are now at $1.2 billion, accounting for 3.5 per cent of Philips' global revenue. Most of the growth has come in the past five years," adds Krishna who believes that the company is here for a long haul.
In India, 32 per cent of revenue is from healthcare, about 46 per cent from lighting, and the remaining from consumer lifestyle business.
Philips, however, is eyeing to rapidly move up the value chain. "It's not that we are an aam admi brand. That's no more what Philips is. We are the most-penetrated player in lighting, and the second deepest in healthcare," says Krishna. In consumer lifestyle, which Krishna says is a "rocking category" in India, Philips focus on healthy living (with coffee-makers, air-fryers that are essentially geared for healthy eating and beverages).
The dynamics at Philips might have changed as has the location of its headquarters - from the then Bombay to Gurgaon in the National Capital Region. But, with a young team in India and with Indians in all of Philips' global offices, including its headquarters, Krishna is hopeful that the company will soon regain its old glory.

Spectrum pricing to hurt investment: Sistema presidentSpectrum pricing to hurt investment: Sistema president
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 11, 2014 09:16 PM IST
While the Government has been trying to make more spectrum available for the telecom operators, the latest pricing would hurt the telecom operators and could hamper further investment in the sector, Mikhail Shamolin, president & CEO, Sistema, said on Thursday.
"For us it is very important to understand how the telecom policy will be changing and evolving in the future, what is going to happen with the spectrum availability. The kind of prices on the CDMA spectrum that we saw announced recently are exceptionally high and almost prohibitively high for making return on telecom investment and we will be in a deep discussions," Shamolin said, reported a television channel. He was speaking on the sidelines of MTS iNNOVATSii - an initiative by Sistema Shyam Teleservices in India to look for telecom ideas that can be applied in commercial, social or government spheres with a high level objective to improve the overall quality of life.
On Wednesday, Sistema Shyam Teleservices, the lone operator that uses CDMA technology in India, had asked the Government to rethink on the base price for 800MHz band spectrum, and has suggested that the reserve price should be at par with the market discovered price of 1800MHz band.
In a statement, Sistema Shyam Teleservices said, at such a price one would not find any takers for 800MHz spectrum in the 2015 auctions, given that this price has also been previously tested in the market, way back in November 2012. "We would urge the Government to rethink on the spectrum price for 800MHz band and bring it at par with the market discovered price of 1800MHz," it added.
Inter-ministerial panel Telecom Commission has in a meeting earlier this week recommended the base price of 800MHz band airwave at Rs 3,646 crore per MHz (pan-Indian), about 17 per cent more than what the Telecom Regulatory of Authority of India (Trai) had recommended last month. Meanwhile, Trai suggested reserve price was about 15 per cent higher than what it had recommended in February. Last month, the regulator had recommended the reserve price to be Rs 3,104 crore, which is 72 per cent higher than the Rs 1,800 crore rate in 2013 auction.
The Telecom Commission has suggested the base price of 1800MHz band radiowave should be Rs 2,191 crore per MHz across 20 telecom zones.
"It is not in sync with the business and ecosystem realities. The proposed pricing of Rs 3,646 crore per MHz is way out of line and does not merit a strong business case for buying spectrum in the said band," Sistema Shyam Teleservices, which operates under MTS brand in India, said in a statement.

Govt to use tech to improve governance  curb corruption: PM ModiBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 10:14 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said government would effectively use technology to improve governance and check the menace of corruption.
In his interaction with US-based economists, the Prime Minister underlined the need for “injecting technology” into government processes and decision-making.
These initiatives, he added, would also provide the best possible solution to the problem of corruption.
Corruption, it may be mentioned, was one of the major election planks during the polls earlier this year which saw emergence of BJP as the majority party at the Centre.
Talking to the US economists, the Prime Minister said his government would accord “topmost priority” to skill development and job creation.
All government policies would be youth-centric as 65 per cent of India’s population is below the age of 35, said an official release quoting the Prime Minister.
He said the government’s focus on infrastructure and ‘Digital India’ would boost employment opportunities even in rural areas.
India’s federal structure should be viewed as a “development mechanism” rather than just a “constitutional arrangement,” Modi said, adding that he would endeavour to build “Team India” through a partnership with all state Chief Ministers and by encouraging and facilitating states to take initiatives for economic growth.
Stating that a person, who is unhealthy cannot derive any benefit from exercise, the Prime Minister said in the first six months his government focused on making India healthy once again.
He further said the success of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, which was for the benefit of the poor, had boosted the confidence of the government.
Speaking on the occasion, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley gave an overview of the various decisions taken by the government in the last six months in the economic sphere.
The Minister said there was a mood of optimism and expectation from the new Government, and the process of pragmatic and realistic decision-making was giving results.

Pushed on ghar wapsi  govt calls for laws against conversionWritten by Rakesh Sinha , Raghvendra Rao | New Delhi |
Posted: December 11, 2014 9:40 pm | Updated: December 12, 2014 10:26 am
 
Under Opposition fire for allowing RSS and its affiliates to push ahead with their conversion and ‘ghar wapsi’ campaigns, the Government told Lok Sabha Thursday it was in favour of anti-conversion laws in all states and at the Centre too.
Opening a three-hour discussion on the issue of religious conversion — it was agreed upon after chaotic scenes in the House over the Agra incident involving the conversion of 57 Muslim families by Bajrang Dal activists — the Opposition mounted a spirited attack which lost steam when one of its own, the Samajwadi Party, broke ranks.
To the merriment of the treasury benches, SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, whose son Akhilesh Yadav is heading the government in Uttar Pradesh, repeated what some in the BJP said: “Nothing happened in Agra… will you run this House by reading newspapers?”

Later, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu’s remark “I am proud of my RSS background” led to an uproar and the entire Opposition walked out without waiting for him to complete his reply to the discussion. “How can you allow a minister to speak in such a way,” angry Opposition members were heard telling the Speaker.
In his reply, Naidu said: “The RSS is a great organisation of the country. RSS means Ready for Selfless Service. That is RSS. I feel proud that I have an RSS background. It is because of RSS background, discipline, character, calibre, capacity that I have come to this level. We feel proud. Many of us have this background.”
Ignoring the walkout, he continued, “Some people are allergic to the word Hindu… Let there be anti-conversion laws in all states, let there be an anti-conversion law at the Centre… these people (Opposition) go on like a stuck HMV record… let me assure you, the Government will do all it takes to maintain harmony in this country.”
Key leaders on both sides were missing during the discussion — Prime Minister Narendra Modi and senior ministers, barring Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar, were not present in the House; Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge too were absent.
Jyotiraditya Scindia of the Congress, who opened the discussion, was repeatedly interrupted by BJP members when he accused the RSS, its Dharm Jagran affiliate and Bajrang Dal of being behind conversion and ‘ghar wapsi’ campaigns.
“Our country is a bouquet of not one kind of flower but many. The fragrance of its many flowers spreads across the world… I am proud to be a Hindu but my religion does not teach me to be narrow-minded, or have a narrow ideology. My dharm continued…

NCP to lodge no confidence motion against council chairmanBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 11, 2014 9:10 pm
The state NCP chief Sunil Tatkare on Thursday said they have decided to bring a no confidence motion against chairman of the state legislative council following his failure to declare Dhananjay Munde as the opposition leader in state council.
The NCP has written a letter to the presiding officer in state legislature council expressing lack of confidence in the present chairman of the council. The NCP leaders said, “We have already given
the name of Dhananjay Munde as opposition leader in council. Why is chairman not accepting?”
The Congress has withheld the decision in council, as it wants NCP to first give consent to their senior leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil consent as opposition leader in state legislature assembly. However, NCP has refused arguing they want Ajit Pawar as opposition leader in assembly as well.

A three-day slump in stocks — created a big opportunity for brave investors paying attention to scoop up some quick gains.
There are 14 stocks in the broad Russell 1000 index, including medical services provider athenahealth (ATHN), trendy apparel seller Urban Outfitters (URBN) and office supply chain Staples (SPLS) that are up 5% or more Thursday as the market shakes off recent fears on strong retail data .
These powerful jumps are yet another example of how being brave and bold has been a way to win in the stock market. Each time the market runs into trouble — due to some seemingly scary external factor — simply is a chance to make a quick buck. The market is exploding higher Thursday — after suffering that past three days on fears falling oil prices will hurt corporate earnings.
Interestingly, the big winners from the day’s pop are the stocks that were rallying while the rest of the market was suffering. Athenahealth is a big winner, gaining nearly 11%. The stock is now nearly 12% higher than where it was when the market topped recently on Dec. 5.
It’s a similar story for Staples. The stock is up 9.2% Thursday to $16.18 a share, pulling it further ahead of its level on Dec. 5 of $14.38.
The lesson? When others are nervous –you should be looking to capitalize — at least in this market.

Programme to focus on infectious diseases
Hyderabad, December 11:  
Medvarsity, a first medical e-learning initiative from Apollo group of hospitals, will work with the University of New South Wales (Australia) to collaborate in the healthcare e-learning space with a focus on the management of infectious diseases.
Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Hariprasad, Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Central India, said that there was a severe scarcity for specialists who can deal with infectious diseases. “There is no structured curriculum for Infection Medicine in the country,” he said.
Course launch
Medvarsity will launch its maiden course, focusing on infectious diseases, next month. Targeted towards the doctors and other stakeholders who want to update their knowledge on the subject, the course material has been developed by leading medical practitioners from Apollo and UNSW’s School of Public Health and Community Medicine.
“This programme is a blend of online and hands on training at Apollo Hospitals initially. There are a few other programmes in the pipeline through this collaboration,” he said.
Key aspects
The one year diploma course covers vaccines, current challenges in controlling the diseases, surveillance of infectious diseases and pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.
“India is facing challenges in facing emerging and endemic infectious diseases. There is a need to increase the number of trained personnel to address this issue,” Raina McIntyre, Head of School of Public Health, UNSW, said here on Thursday as the two institutions joined hands.
‘Increasing threat’
Apollo Hospitals group Joint Managing Director Sangita Reddy said the threat of infectious diseases assuming alarming levels in the world. “The Medvarsity tie up with the Australian university would help develop a solution to address the challenge posed by infectious diseases.
“The collaboration between the two institutions would continue in other areas as well in future.”

The Centre’s fact-finding team will investigate the ‘growing attacks’ on Muslims in West Bengal, allegedly by TMC workers
New Delhi, December 11:  
The Minority Affairs Ministry will soon send a fact-finding team to West Bengal following ‘growing attacks’ on Muslims, allegedly by Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers.
“The issue is very serious. We will very soon send a fact-finding team there and will also seek a probe by the National Minorities Commission,” Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Minister of State for Minority Affairs, told reporters in Parliament House on Thursday.
Naqvi said his Ministry would also flag the issue with the National Human Rights Commission.
Earlier, a delegation of BJP leaders, led by SS Ahluwalia (MP from North Bengal), Siddharth Nath Singh (National Secretary), Babul Supriyo (MP from Asansol) and others handed over a letter to Naqvi, bringing to his notice the alleged ‘violence against Muslims’ particularly in Birbhum, 24 Parganas and Midnapore, urging him to send a Central probe team.
“The State police is in collusion and is pointing out targets,” alleged Ahluwalia, adding that “grenades were found in a public health centre in Birbhum.”
He claimed the attacks were growing because lakhs of TMC workers had ‘shifted’ to the BJP.
Of late, the face-off between TMC and BJP has been intensifying in the State leading to communal polarisation, especially in rural areas, as both the political parties see each other as key rivals in the Assembly elections due in 2016.

Automotive journalist who owns a diminutive Smart car comes clean on why he loves it.
The two-seat Smart car, which often gets the short end of automotive jeers, is beloved by one journalist.
Clown car, pingpong ball, dorkmobile--it doesn't matter: This owner loves his Smart car.
I must confess: I own a Smart.
Gas tank empty on your shiny new 2014 Toyota Corolla? ( Jim Mateja, Special to Tribune Newspapers )
My husband thought I should get a 50 percent discount since I only bought half a car. I made a comment in a meeting about things not working out as planned and my boss said, "You mean like your Smart car." My best friend told me he would never ride in that "dorkmobile" (the dork has since ridden in it many times), and a writing buddy claims it's the worst car he's ever driven (he owns a DeLorean).
My dad calls it the pingpong ball.
I don't care because I love the little car.
I first saw one in person at the 2005 Detroit Auto Show, where Smart had a display to gauge American demand. The car was shockingly small but roomier than I expected and as cool as I imagined. When Smart began U.S. sales in 2008, I went online, optioned a coupe, deposited $99, and waited a year for delivery. Yep, I'm nuts.

Boxes were checked for heated leather seats, automatic wipers, subwoofer and clear polycarbonate roof. Power windows and a leather-wrapped steering wheel came standard. I regret not getting the convertible.
I'd heard about the rough ride, obstinate transmission and fear of crashes. None of that bothers me; the car is essentially a safety cage with plastic body panels, suspension and mid-mounted three-cylinder engine attached. More importantly, it fits end-to-end with my Corvette in the garage. My dad, who builds street rods, doesn't understand how one son can have both.
The engine produces only 70 horsepower, but the 1,800-pound car cruises comfortably at 80 mph. It's not a snowmobile, but we've survived a foot. Crosswinds are wicked — I once hit a gust so hard it activated stability control.
It's convenient though. Before our baby, my husband and I wedged the car into tiny crevices at restaurants near our house — perfect for Friday nights. Now, with the tall roof and big doors, baby carriers fit easily and my daughter loves looking through the roof.
Defying city life, I've driven two round trips from Indianapolis to Myrtle Beach, S.C., and another to Savannah, Ga. Flat-footing it through the mountains leaves you feeling like you just drove the Indy 500. The short wheelbase requires finesse, but brakes are strong. With limited power, momentum becomes gold.
Six years in, the car has been trouble-free and fun to own. It's quirky, but that's what makes it lovable. Because we journalists drive so many cars, only those at the extremes really capture our attention — whether that's a Corvette, Ram diesel or Smart. At least that's what I'd tell my dad.

Ann Compton Says She s Seen Obama Go On A  Profanity-Laced  TiradeFormer ABC News reporter Ann Compton said Monday that she's seen President Barack Obama lose his cool with reporters on more than one occasion.
“I have seen, In the last year, Barack Obama really angry twice," Compton said in an interview with C-SPAN, speaking about the relationship between presidents and press. "Both were off the record times, one profanity-laced, where he thought the press was making too much of scandals that he didn’t think were scandals, another where he took us to task for not understanding the limits he has with foreign policy and the way he’s dealing with the Middle East and Iraq and Afghanistan.
"And I don't find him apologetic," she continued, "but I find him willing to stand up to press and look them in the eye, even though it was off the record, and just give us hell."
Compton, who retired in September , became the first female to cover the White House for a network news organization in 1974, reporting on every president since Gerald Ford.
In a follow-up question, she was asked if she thought Obama had a point.
“From his point of view, he may," she answered. "But we cover what we are allowed to cover. When policy decisions and presidents are inaccessible and don’t take questions from the press on a regular basis, I think they reap what they sow."

How to Avoid Getting Dumped Over a Christmas GiftWill you get dumped because of your gift?
Eric Chemi CNBC
Email
One of this year's hot Christmas sellers will almost certainly be the Samsung Galaxy S5.  Forty-two percent of shoppers think stores will have shortages of the popular  smartphone this Christmas, according to a survey released Wednesday by big data  firm 1010data . But before you run out to buy one for your  significant other, you'd better be sure it's what she wants.
The nationwide survey also found that most Americans have gotten the cold  shoulder, silent treatment, or worse from their significant others as a result  of giving an unwanted holiday gift (even if it was because the ideal gift they  wanted was unavailable or out of stock).
DADO RUVIC / Reuters
The Samsung Galaxy S5 will likely be one of the year's top gifts. But before you buy it for your significant other, make sure it's what he or she wants.
Just over half of the 1,004 respondents said the recipient argued, cried,  complained—or even ended the relationship—after getting the gift. The  remaining 48 percent listed "other" open-ended negative responses,  including: "demanded a refund," "slight disappointment they try not to show  outwardly," and "took it back and exchanged it for what she wanted."
Maybe the only true solution for avoiding disappointment came from the wife  who shared: "My husband and I do not exchange gifts during the  holidays."
Video: TODAY contributor Jill Martin brings viewers hot deals for the holidays, some selling for more than 70 percent off.
"There is real concern among consumers about not getting the gifts on their  shopping list this holiday season," said Sandy Steier, 1010data CEO, adding that besides the Galaxy S5, shoppers think iPhones, iPads, Xbox One and  PlayStation will be out of stock.
Shortages have an amazing way of causing lifelong memories. The most  memorable gift shortages weren't even in this century: 18 percent of respondents  said the 1983 shortage of Cabbage Patch Kids brought back the most fear from  past years. Other scary memories were brought to life by 1996's Tickle Me Elmo,  1998's Furby, and even toys from the 1960s and 1970s: Chatty Cathy, GI Joe and  Star Wars.
"Our research also shows that the experience of holiday shopping is a  memorable one for most people—in some cases going back 30 years," said Steier.  "When you consider that degree of association with a brand, you can understand  how important it is for businesses to have items in stock and available to meet  consumer demand."
Still, you may want to not wait any longer if you're looking for a popular  product. Or you may risk spending New Year's  alone.

5 year-end retirement tips0
2. Consider converting Traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. A conversion requires that you pay the tax due on your retirement assets now instead of in the future. Whether or not a conversion makes sense for you depends on a number of factors, the most important of which is whether or not you can pay the tax due with non-retirement funds. If you have money available to pay the tax due, some advantages of conversion are: paying the tax at a lower tax rate, if you think that your tax bracket will rise in the future; eliminating the tax on future growth of assets; reducing future Required Minimum Distributions (RMD's); and reducing the taxable amount of Social Security benefits. If you already converted your account this year, you may want to reexamine it. If the value went down, you have until your extended filing deadline to reverse the conversion. That way, you may be able to perform a conversion later and pay less tax.
3. Be aware of new IRA rollover rules. Starting in 2015, new rules apply for withdrawing and rolling over money from an IRA. Next year, you can only roll over an account once every 365 days (note: the rule specifies "every 365 days," not once a calendar year). The rule applies to IRA-to-IRA rollovers where the owner takes custody of the money him or herself. The rule does not apply to rollovers from employer plans to IRAs or to "trustee to trustee" transfers.
4. Take Required Minimum Distributions. Generally, once you turn 70 Â½, you must begin withdrawing a specific amount of money from your retirement assets (there are some exceptions). Remember, money that you have previously contributed to these accounts bypassed taxation - RMD's ensure that the government taxes those funds. The penalty for not taking your RMD is steep -- 50 percent on the shortfall!
A few notes about RMDs: Even if you have multiple individual retirement accounts, you don't have to take the RMD out of each individual account. You are allowed to take one RMD from any of your retirement accounts, based on your age and the total value of the accounts. Also, filing a joint return doesn't mean you can take the entire amount for both spouses from one spouse's account - RMDs are calculated for each individual. Finally, if you inherit an IRA, check before year's end to see if you need to take an RMD on behalf of the deceased.
5. Consider a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD). Since its enactment in 2006, one way to sidestep the taxation on your RMD is to make a Qualified Charitable Distribution, which allows you to gift up to $100,000 directly from your IRA to a charity without having to include the distribution in your taxable income. However, you swap having to claim the income for making a charitable deduction. Not only does a QCD help avoid taxation, it also means that the extra income is not included in other tax formulas for Social and Medicare Part B premiums or for the Pease limitation on itemized deductions. As of this writing, lawmakers have not yet extended the QCD and while experts believe that it will be extended, you should be careful. If you choose to make a QCD, remember that the money must go directly to the charity, not to a private foundation or a donor-advised fund.

Jharkhand polls: Rajnath Singh promises steps for Bhuli if BJP winsPress Trust of India | Dec 11, 2014 at 05:00pm IST
Dhanbad (Jharkhand): Steps to solve the long standing problems of miners staying at Bhuli, Asia's largest labour colony, would be taken if BJP is voted to power in Jharkhand, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said.
Addressing an election rally at Bhuli, Singh said the Union Coal minister would visit Dhanbad along with local MPs and MLAs to solve the miners' problems within six months of forming of the BJP government in the state. Bhuli area, which falls in Dhanbad constituency which goes to the hustings in the fourth phase on December 14, faces several long standing issues like evacuation.
Stating that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had created Jharkhand as the region was neglected for years, Singh claimed that the erstwhile BJP governments in the state had taken welfare schemes but due to coalition compulsions they could not be implemented.
Bhuli area faces several long standing issues like evacuation.
Appealing to the electorate to vote for BJP, Singh said in the past six months the country's image abroad and in the country has changed into a positive one after a period of crisis of political credibility. Prices have come down after years of upward graph, he said.
Imparting skill training to the youth is one of the aims of the central government, he added.

BJP  RSS spreading communal tension through conversions: BSP10
0
New Delhi: BSP on Thursday accused BJP and RSS of spreading communal tension in the country through forced conversions and sought a ban on such outfits saying it was the responsibility of both the Centre and the state government to take stern action against them.
Terming religious conversions as very serious issue, the BSP Supremo Mayawati asked all the opposition parties to become serious on the issue.
"The issue of religious conversions is very serious. BJP and its other organisations like RSS, Bajrang Dal and others, although want to create communal tension in the entire country in this particular issue, they (BJP) have made UP their main adda. All opposition parties should become serious on this issue," Mayawati said.
Terming religious conversions as very serious issue, the BSP Supremo Mayawati asked all the opposition parties to become serious on the issue.
#bsp #bjp #rss #mayawati
Referring to the alleged forced conversion in Agra in Uttar Pradesh, she said the responsibility in this issue also lies with the Samajwadi Party government in the state as they are in power.
"The responsibility also lies with the Samajwadi Party government in UP as they are in power. BJP and its associate organisations, under the garb of religious conversion wants to create communal tension in UP, it is the responsibility of the SP government and it should initiate stern action against those elements who are involved in this," she demanded.
Noting that she had taken up the issue in Parliament yesterday as well, Mayawati said, it is not only the SP government's responsiblity, the Centre also has equal responsibility.
"The Centre is led by BJP and its associate organisation which is trying to worsen the atmoshphere in the country through issues like conversions. The law and order situation in the country might deteriorate through this. In this situation, the Centre, if they do not have a hand in this, it is their responsibility to ban the associate organisations," she said.
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said his party has always opposed such conversions, done either by enticing or forcefully.
"We have never been in favour of such conversions. BJP has always opposed any business of religious conversions done either by enticing or forcefully," he said.
Taking a dig at the opposition, he said when his party raised the issue in the past, the "secular" voices raised their voice against ours saying whatever BJP was saying was wrong.
The particular incident is of UP where neither BJP nor NDA is in power.
"Mayawati was in power before and Congress party had supported it. Now Mulayam Singh is running the government which is again supported by Congress. This is a matter related to law and order and they should see that if these things are happening, it should not take place," he said.

The Customer Service Experience That Absolutely Shocked Mereddit
With the precision of a Rockettes' dance number, one by one the windows in my house have all snapped the little doohickey that lets them slide up and down smoothly and keeps them from  going off-tilt. If I were a window repairman, I'm sure there would be a real name for the broken part and with that real name, a real expensive price tag and a real expensive labor call.
But karma intervened and a handyman who I had asked over for a repair estimate wound up being both knowledgable and honest. "Milgard windows?" he said, as I waited for the proverbial kicking of the tires that always comes when one craftsman disses the work of another. "You don't need me. These have a lifetime warranty," he said instead. "They will just come out and fix them or replace them for you." He scribbled down the number while I waited for my dropped jaw to close.
Still unconvinced that anyone in this day and age offers a lifetime warranty on anything, I called the number. The woman dutifully checked my name and address in her computer and asked "When would it be convenient to have a serviceman there?"
"No charge, right?" I asked.
"That's right, Ma'am."
"Not for labor or parts or anything?" I asked again.
"No Ma'am. We offer lifetime warranties."
I was in shock. Speechless.
"Ma'am? Would you like to schedule a service call?" she interrupted my stupor.
"Aha! How much for the service call?" I asked, the "gotcha" element oozing in my words.
"We don't charge for the service call."
They are coming next week. At my convenience. Not an eight-hour window during which I have to wait, but I will be the first stop of the day. And it will be free, all covered by a warranty that is now 12 years old.
I am flabbergasted: An honest contractor told me how to not pay him gobs of money and an honest company honored an agreement that I long ago forgot about if I ever even knew it.
I was unprepared for the shocking value of good customer service.
We live in a time when products are designed and made for obsolescence. We don't repair appliances, we replace them. We anticipate that when we make a call of complaint it will fall on deaf ears. We spend hours listening to Muzak to get nowhere with our banks, our credit card companies, our health insurance carriers. We complacently wait on hold to talk to a live person at the cable company. We agree to punch in our account numbers on our phones as directed by a computer, only to have to repeat those numbers to the "customer service representative" when they finally get on the line. We allow a call center "manager" to read from a script and repeat how sorry he is but can do nothing. We are treated like pond scum by repairmen who are incapable of estimating when they will show up and often just don't. The lines at the bank are long, longer at the supermarket, and longer still when we try to fight our way to a parking spot at the mall -- and yet we wait in them all like good lemmings. Restaurants expect us to make sure their workers are paid a living wage through our tips whether the service is good or not and workers in stores of all kind are trained so superficially they don't know the inventory or store policies.
Customer service? It doesn't exist anymore, at least not in any recognizable shape. Stores have overhauled their return policies. Old Navy won't give you a store credit without a receipt. Target, which used to allow exchanges for store credit regardless if you had the receipt, now demands a receipt and items can only be exchanged for something similar in the same department. Then there's something called a "restocking fee" which Target and other stores impose on returned electronics -- even those never opened.
I remember when Sears replaced my father's hammer after a lifetime of use, but I only vaguely remember it. I'm told that most of those Craftsman tools no longer carry that same lifetime warranty. I love that Nordstrom and Zappos pride themselves on good customer service, but I know they are the exceptions to the rule.
As for Milgard and my windows? I am shocked at how shocking good service has become. Go Milgard!

This chart details the "permanent" fiber optic 'video dialtone' deployments throughout America starting in 1992. By 2010 or there abouts, America was supposed to have been a fully-fiberized nation with fiber optic-based broadband utilities -- really.
Starting in 1991, the phone companies went state-to-state to get changes in state laws, known as "alternative regulations" to charge customers for the replacement of the copper wires that were part of the state-based utility, like Verizon New Jersey, with a fiber optic wire capable of 45 Mbps in both directions, the standard speed for broadband in 1992.
And though it varied by state, this fiber optic wiring was to be done everywhere -- urban, rural, and suburban, rich and poor communities and cities, and even the schools were to be wired in some states. All customers were paying for the upgrades of this future fiber optic broadband utility so they all deserved to be upgraded.
And these "video dialtone" permanent deployments were the federal version of the state laws. And in fact, Bell Atlantic (now-Verizon) sued the FCC to be able to do these fiber optic swap-outs of the copper wire.
However, these FCC filings were only a partial list of what was promised in every state. For example, by 2000, Verizon claimed it would spend $11 billion to have 8.75 million homes and businesses upgraded to fiber by 2000. Meanwhile, Pacific Bell of California (now AT&T California), claimed it would have 5.5 million households wired by 2000 and spend $16 billion dollars to do it.
But this was all fiber-to-the-annual reports and press releases. The telcos' video dialtone networks were never deployed, and virtually this entire list of millions of fiber optic broadband lines that were to be installed were abandoned.  No state was wired, and in fact, most of the companies pulled a bait-and-switch and offered Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service over the old copper wiring. But the state laws were never changed back and as far as we could ascertain, no state ever went back and got refunds or removed the "incentives" that charged customers for these upgrades, nor investigated the major tax perks.
By the end of 2014, we estimate that $400 billion has been collected for this network infrastructure that was never deployed as promised as an upgrade of the state telecommunications utility networks by replacing the copper wiring with fiber optic cables to create a broadband utility for the delivery of voice, video and data services.
Two facts stand out:
Between 1993-1996 the combined companies took25 billion dollars in one-time tax deductions, claiming they were replacing the copper wires with fiber, even though it wasn't replaced. This was above and beyond other tax perks.
Starting in 1992 when the state alternative regulation plans were being implemented, through 2000, the Bell companies' return on equity (profits) went from an average of 14 % to 29% - a 107% increase.  These increases were 188% above the other Utilities. (Source: Business Week Scoreboards, 1993-2000) I.e., instead of using the money for new construction, it somehow ended up as just more profits.
But what at first shocked me, (I'm over it now), as I've been covering and writing about these fiber optic broadband deployments in America since the 1990's, is that:
Virtually no one has a clue that they have been and continue to pay for these upgrades (if they had phone or any service from the incumbents, now-AT&T, Verizon and Centurylink). And these increases were on all business and residential services, as well as services used by municipalities, schools, etc.
The FCC entirely erased this history of fiber optic broadband in America. No "Advanced Network" report (based on a requirement of Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to see if broadband was being deployed in a timely fashion) ever included the state-based fiber optic-based obligations or the fact that customers have been paying extra for network upgrades since the 1990's.
There have been multiple additional rate increases for broadband over the last two decades, and no government agency has ever done a full accounting of the monies collected or the failure of the deployments.
We're all still paying for this in many ways -- We are 29th in the world in broadband in download speeds and 43rd in upload speeds, according to Ookla.
AT&T's entire U-Verse is a copper-to-the-home service, (it is fiber-to-the-node, (FTTN) i.e., fiber within ½ mile of the location) and Verizon's FiOS is fiber optics but the company has stopped deployments.
By 2014, the speeds should have evolved to gigabit offerings as the standard in 1992 was 45 Mbps in both directions.
And they have us coming and going. We have been also overcharged for broadband upgrades (and the wiring of schools for high-speed Internet) by the cable companies. In 1995 the FCC cut a deal with Comcast, Time Warner and the other cablecos, actually called "The Social Contract"; the companies could charge up to $5.00 a month to upgrade their networks and supply high speed Internet to schools for free or at cost.  This Contract expired in 2000 and yet there is no evidence this 'temporary' charge was removed or that they wired the schools for cable modem service. Industry-wide, that's $300 million a month, $3.6 billion a year, for 14 years -- about $50 billion extra, over $800 per household -- but who's counting?
Let's hear from one of those who failed to come through -- Now-Verizon.
I'm personally tired of people, especially the telco-paid pundits, astroturf groups, et al who claim there were no commitments, no changes in state laws and no monies collected.
I give you Bell Atlantic's 1993 Annual Report (now Verizon) to shut up the naysayers, followed by a Bell Atlantic 1996 press release about fiber-to-the-curb to have 12 million homes and business wired by 2000.  Bell Atlantic (including the merger with NYNEX), controlled the East Coast from Maine through Virginia, (with the exception of most of Connecticut).
I note that "The Book of Broken Promises" was written to document this broadband scandal, one of the largest telecom scandals in history.
We left the complete quotes. They give the history of fiber optic broadband, the legal actions to offer video on phone lines (video dialtone), the announced commitments, including monies to be spent, and Verizon's ability to get changes in regulations to give them more money and profit that should have been used to replace the copper wiring of state-based utility with a fiber optic future.  And this proves that America was supposed to be a leader in fiber optic deployments starting in 1993 -- over 21 years ago-- but who's counting?
Bell Atlantic 1993 Annual Report (Now Verizon)
"First, we announced our intention to lead the country in the deployment of the information highway.
"In December, we issued our technology requirements to potential suppliers for a new video-capable technology platform that will accelerate our entry into attractive markets for entertainment and interactive multimedia services. We expect Bell Atlantic's enhanced network will be ready to serve 8.75 million homes by the end of the year 2000. By the end of 1998, we plan to wire the top 20 markets in our Mid-Atlantic region. These investments will help establish Bell Atlantic as a world leader in what is clearly the high-growth opportunity for the 1990s and beyond--interactive, multimedia communications, entertainment and information services that address the vast, unfulfilled demand for customer choice, convenience and control.
"We will spend $11 billion over the next five years to rapidly build full- service networks capable of providing these services within the Bell Atlantic region. What's more, we will expand Bell Atlantic's global presence by developing attractive investment opportunities in Europe, Mexico and the Pacific Rim.
Telephone Company Provision of Video Dial Tone and Video Programming
Background:
"In 1987, the FCC initiated an inquiry into whether developments in the cable and telephone industries warranted changes in the rules prohibiting telephone companies such as the Network Services Companies from providing video programming in their respective service territories directly or indirectly through an affiliate.
"In November 1991, the FCC released a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in these proceedings. In August 1992, the FCC issued an order permitting telephone companies such as the Network Services Companies to provide "video dial tone" service. Video dial tone permits telephone companies to provide video transport to multiple programmers on a non-discriminatory common carrier basis. The FCC has also ruled that neither telephone companies that provide video dial tone service, nor video programmers that use these services, are required to obtain local cable franchises. Other parties have appealed these orders, which remain in effect pending the outcome of the appeal.
"In late 1992, Bell Atlantic - New Jersey entered into agreements pursuant to which, pending regulatory approval, it would provide video dial tone transport services to two video programmers in New Jersey. As contemplated by its contract with Sammons Communications, Incorporated ("Sammons"), Bell Atlantic -New Jersey will deploy fiber optic technology that will enable Sammons and other video information providers to deliver video programming in three Morris County, New Jersey communities over a video dial tone platform. Bell Atlantic - New Jersey's contract with Future Vision of America Corporation ("Future Vision") contemplates that Bell Atlantic - New Jersey will deploy fiber optic technology in the Dover Township, New Jersey telephone network to establish a video dialtone platform that will allow Future Vision and other video information providers to deliver competitive video programming services in that community. Applications for approval to deploy these video dial tone systems are pending at the FCC.
"In December 1992, Bell Atlantic - Virginia and Bell Atlantic Video Services Company filed a lawsuit against the federal government in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia seeking to overturn the prohibition in the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 against LECs providing video programming in their respective service areas. In a decision rendered in August 1993 and clarified in October 1993, the court struck down this prohibition as a violation of the First Amendment's freedom of speech protections and enjoined its enforcement against the Company, the Network Services Companies and Bell Atlantic Video Services Company. This decision has been appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
"In early 1993, the FCC granted the Company authority to test a new technology known as Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line ("ADSL") for use in delivering video entertainment and information over existing copper telephone lines. Beginning in March 1993, the Company began a one-year technical trial of ADSL serving up to 400 Bell Atlantic employees in northern Virginia. In the Fall of 1993, Bell Atlantic petitioned the FCC for authorization to expand and convert this technical trial, upon its completion, into a six month market trial serving up to 2,000 customers. Bell Atlantic also requested authority to offer a commercial video dial tone service to customers served by 25 central offices in parts of northern Virginia and southern Maryland upon completion of the six month market trial. These applications are pending at the FCC.
"Third, we continued to make major strides in the public policy arena toward achieving the freedoms necessary to compete.
"Last summer, the state legislatures in Pennsylvania and Delaware authorized new regulatory frameworks that, when implemented, will give us the incentives to invest in new technology and services that will meet customer needs and provide long-term growth opportunities in a competitive environment. Plans for similar alternative regulation have been approved or are pending in all seven state jurisdictions. Moreover, all telephone subsidiaries have been afforded some degree of pricing flexibility for products and services subject to competition.
"Perhaps the most significant public policy development last year was our successful challenge to the provision of the 1984 Cable Act that prohibits Bell Atlantic from providing video programming in its traditional service territories. The District Court ruling opens lucrative new markets for Bell Atlantic as it expands consumer choice. It may prove to be a forerunner of even more change, as legislation proposing to lift remaining barriers to our full participation in the information marketplace makes its way through Congress."
This hype of a fiber optic future was still going on in 1996. Here are sections from a 1996 Bell Atlantic press release about fiber-to-the-curb deployments -- 12 million homes and businesses were to be completed by the end of the year 2000 -- Stop laughing.
This was done as a broadband 'carrot' to make sure that the Bell Atlantic-NYNEX merger closed -- and it worked.

Agra conversion debate in Parliament: Law needed in all states  says Centre; Opposition walks out127
0
New Delhi: The Centre on Thursday said an anti-conversion law was needed in all the states and the issue needed a wider debate. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Nadu said this while replying to a debate in the Lok Sabha on the Agra conversion issue even as the major opposition parties staged a walkout.
Naidu said that conversion is not a simple issue and it needs wider debate. The opposition parties had accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of spreading communal tension in the country through forced conversions.
Defending his government, Naidu said, "We are clear about what we have promised to the people and we will work hard to fulfill that agenda, others should not have any misconception."
#venkaiah naidu #bjp #parliament #rss
He said if anything had happened, the district magistrate and district administration of Agra will take action. "If you want an advisory to be issued by the Centre, the Centre is ready to help the state to maintain law and order," he said.
Naidu also responded to All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen's Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi's brother Akbaruddin Owaisi's comments on Hindu religion. "I don't want to comment on what his brother said about Hindu gods. I don't want this house to rouse sentiments," Naidu said.
He alleged that some people had allergy for the word Hindu. "The word Hindu is not given by Modi, Venkaiah Naidu or RSS. We are a party which believes in philosophy of India is one."
Naidu said there were laws on conversion in Odisha, another one was formulated in Madhya Pradesh during the Congress regime and a law was there in Himachal Pradesh. "It's not due to Modiji. It is there in these states because they realised the need for it."
Meanwhile, Aligarh MP Satish Gautam said that such a "conversion" event will happen in the city. He said, "We have been doing this for several years and will do it again on December 25. This isn't a conversion but 'ghar wapsi' (home coming)."
Talking about the accusations against RSS, Naidu said, "What is the relation of this debate with RSS? The RSS is a great organisation of the country, ready for selfless service. I have RSS background and I am proud of it."
Naidu further said, "When they abuse and accuse the mother organisation from where we have taken inspiration, I cannot remain silent, you may have difference with Dinanath Batra but how can you abuse him?"
Naidu said the the government was ready to discuss any issue. "My PM has told me let's discuss any issue, as long as the Chair allows."
The Minister also replied to charges against HRD Minister  Smriti Irani consulting an astrologer. "What's wrong in Smriti Irani going to astrologer? Why do you insult others' belief?"
The House had witnessed similar uproarious scenes on Wednesday with the Opposition MPs demanding a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue. They said at least 100 Muslims were converted by an RSS offshoot by force and allurement, which was a criminal offence.

April-Nov indirect tax collections up 7%April-November indirect tax collections up 7% y-o-y
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 12, 2014 12:27 AM IST
Indirect tax collections rose just seven per cent in the first eight months against 20 per cent growth pegged in the Budget for the entire 2014-15.
The mop-up stood at about Rs 3.29 lakh crore in April-November of the current financial year against Rs 3.07 lakh crore for the same period last year, according to data released by the finance ministry on Thursday.
The total indirect tax collections for April-November were 52.7 per cent of the full year budgeted estimate of Rs 6.23 lakh crore. This meant that almost half of the Budget estimates will have to be collected in the next four months.
The increase was partly driven by service tax and customs. Service tax for April-November 2014 grew 11.5 per cent to Rs 1.03 lakh crore, from Rs 91,982 crore for the same period last year. Customs grew 10.2 per cent to Rs 1.23 lakh crore from Rs 1.12 lakh crore in April-November 2013.
Meanwhile, central excise duty collection was almost flat year-over-year at Rs 1.03 lakh crore.
However, for November alone, there was some recovery in the indirect tax collections. The total collections grew 19.4 per cent at Rs 44,060 crore in November this year against Rs 36,905 crore in the year-ago period.  
In what could augur well for factory production, central excise duty collections were up 10.4 per cent at Rs 14,952 crore in November against Rs 13,544 crore last year. Customs duty rose 30.8 per cent at Rs 17,185 crore in the month against Rs 13,137 crore in November last year. This might imply that imports were high in November as well, which might not allow trade deficit to come down, if exports did not do well. This might have repercussions for the current account deficit.
Services tax collections were up 16.6 per cent at Rs 11,923 crore in the month against Rs 10,224 crore in the year-ago period.

(The pressure on Rajan to…)
KOLKATA: Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan on Thursday said that the central bank listens to every suggestion on interest rates carefully but a reduction alone is not going to boost the economy.
The pressure on Governor Rajan to lower lending rates is getting intensified by the day. But Rajan, who steadfastly refused to lower rates till the battle against inflation is won, does not seem to be rattled. Ever since he assumed the central banker's role, Rajan has emphasised the central bank's independence quite strongly.
Rajan has reportedly received phone calls from members of Parliament with a suggestion to cut rates.
"Interest rate cut by itself would not lift the economy. It is not the only thing which is holding back economic growth. But it would have some impact," Rajan said after RBI's central board of directors meeting in Kolkata. He was responding to a question on availability of funds and the issues of getting regulatory clearances for setting up projects. On the specific context of his getting calls from MPs, Rajan said: "Lots of people communicate to us. We listen to them. It' not that we don't keep our ears open."
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said he agreed with the call for lower rates but added that the final decision was for the monetary authority, the RBI, to take.
Speaking to reporters after the board meeting, Rajan has allayed concerns over widening current account deficit and said that easing of inflation is expected to push financial savings curtailing the demand for imported gold. The falling oil prices will offer some cushion going forward as well. Current account deficit widened to 2.1% of GDP in July-September quarter.
"We will watch the direction of current account deficit carefully. There are risks to current account deficit. We are vigilant but not apprehensive," Rajan said.
He said RBI is in discussions with the government about reviewing priority sector lending norms for foreign banks operating in India. On limits on foreign investments in government bonds, the governor said RBI might consider raising the limit at an appropriate time and expand it steadily.
Rajan has also chaired the meeting of Financial Stability & Development Council held in Kolkata. The sub-committee reviewed the potential risks facing the financial system and discussed the measures to deepen the currency derivative market ans uniform KYC (know your customer) across institutions.

WASHINGTON: The Obama administration said on Thursday that falling oil prices are helping the U.S. economy and are unlikely to lead to a reduction in production at the country's shale oil fields.
"Lower oil prices are like a tax cut for the economy so in terms of the macroeconomic impact it's net a positive," Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in an interview in New York that was broadcast by network CNBC.
He said America's energy boom means falling oil prices do have some economic drawbacks, but that this is unlikely to affect the level of output in the burgeoning shale energy sector.
"For the shale projects, I don't expect you're going to see a reduction in production," Lew said.

Chaos in Karnataka House over Priyanka Gandhi s picChaos in Karnataka House over Priyanka's pic
PTI  Belagavi  Belagavi, December 11, 2014
First Published: 21:27 IST(11/12/2014) | Last Updated: 01:32 IST(12/12/2014)
Comments
Karnataka Assembly proceedings were paralysed on Thursday amid chaos over a BJP MLA watching a zoomed in picture of Priyanka Gandhi on his mobile phone in the House, with ruling Congress members on the offensive demanding action against the legislator.
As angry Congress members raised the issue demanding action against Prabhu Chavan for his "indecent act" in the House on Wednesday, their counterparts in BJP also hit back with both trading charges against each other, causing pandemonium.
Speaker Kagodu Thimappa adjourned the House for ten minutes initially till afternoon and later for the day as the bedlam persisted despite his efforts to restore calm.
As the House assembled in the morning, slogan shouting Congress members rushed to the front row of seats, demanding strict action against Chavan, saying his "unacceptable" conduct had hurt the dignity of their leader. In a major embarrassment to BJP, Chavan was caught on TV camera watching a zoomed in photo of Priyanka Gandhi on his mobile phone and another BJP MLA U B Banakar playing video games during discussion on the plight of sugarcane growers.
Hitting back at Congress, BJP members led by Jagadish Shettar sought two-day suspension of minister M H Ambareesh and Congress MLA S S Mallikarjun from the House, alleging they were also surfing through mobile phones during proceedings. TV footage was being aired showing Ambareesh and Mallikarjun using mobile phones during discussion on the plight of sugarcane farmers on Wednesday, Shettar said.
Raising the issue, law and parliamentary minister T B Jayachandra demanded action against Chavan and sought a permanent solution to prevent recurrence of such incidents.
The minister said the incident has not only tarnished the image of the two legislators, but also that of the legislature. Referring to the earlier incident during BJP's rule when Laxman Savadi and C C Patil, then ministers, were caught on TV camera watching pornography on their mobiles, he said a report has been submitted but no action was taken.
Shettar demanded that the Chair put an end to such incidents and curb the use of mobile phones in the Assembly. Admitting the folly of his party legislator, Shettar requested the Speaker to allow him to make a statement in the House. He said the act has maligned the image of public representatives. Earlier, Thimappa requested Congress members to take their seats and resume proceedings as Chavan had apologised with tears in his eyes in his chamber. "The legislator visited me and apologised for the incident and shed tears.
I think it will be appropriate that the members resume their seats and allow the house to function," he said. But the Congress members were in no mood to heed his advice. Later when the House resumed proceedings in the afternoon, the bedlam continued, forcing the Speaker to adjourn the house for the entire day.

India needs to overcome  white hair syndrome...Elon Musk
(Tata group's chairman emeritus Ratan Tata…)
MUMBAI: Tata group's chairman emeritus Ratan Tata today said Indians have tremendous potential for inventions and innovations but the country needs to overcome its "white hair syndrome" which restricts opportunities.
"I have always really felt India has tremendous potential for inventions and innovations, but we never really had the opportunity because we suffer from the 'white hair syndrome'. I have white hair (experience) and your idea is never as good as mine," Tata said at an event where the XPrize organisation launched its India chapter.
Tata said he always visualised that an Indian engineer or an inventor solving global problems.
"An Indian engineer or an inventor could solve a global problem but never had a chance to do that from India, and now this may provide a motivation for that to happen. Your ideas have been so visionary. There have always been things considered technically impossible -- artificial eyes, autonomous cars, robots, application of robots, things of this nature," he said.
"This XPrize really broke that tradition to enable a 20-year old to have a great idea and be recognised on a global level for what he has done, with no limitation on his age or wealth or his name, and makes no limitation on what he chooses to do," Tata said at the event.
XPrize is a USA-based non-profit organisation, which motivated development of ideas with large prizes, on whose board Tata serves, along with Google founder Larry Page , acclaimed movie maker James Cameron , Arianna Huffington of Huffington Post as well as PayPal co-founder Elon Musk , among others.
"For me, this is an opportunity. You are very receptive to taking XPrize to India and not restricting it to the USA. Why not look at a country like India which I think has enormous capabilities and strength," Tata said.
Asked about what his dreams are for XPrize India, Tata said, "I think that depends on imagination. What I would like to see is that we give India, and our entrepreneurs, a chance to participate in an area that the US has excelled in, as well as an opportunity to take a chance, to undertake to do something that is considered impossible, and to achieve that in an organised manner with incentives," Tata said.
"I would hope that one day, XPrize India becomes globally visible as a Nobel Prize and in many ways a Nobel Prize for innovation," he said.
India has shown its innovation skills in many areas, Tata said.
"In the medical area also, it has been genome sequencing. It has always been something that is not easy to do. Dreams form a spark and you have the satisfaction of converting it into reality," he said.
Tata said he got attracted to the XPrize as it encouraged to people and faciliated change.
"I was drawn to technological motivation coupled with the physical feat of doing something and not just doing it in a lab, but out in the real world," he said.

Ferrari looks to burnish brand value ahead of IPO

(The aim: position Ferrari…)
MILAN: Ferrari's sleek sports cars and souped-up Formula 1 racing machines have made the prancing horse logo among the world's most powerful brands. Now, as the company prepares for a public listing, it wants to cash in on the cachet.
The aim: position Ferrari not just as a car-maker, but as a luxury goods company. Think Armani, Hermes ... Ferrari.
Analysts say that could mean refining its line of merchandise or creating a chain of exclusive clubs and hotels catering to Ferrari owners and the wealthy.
Chairman Sergio Marchionne will present his vision to investors in the coming weeks, but the potential already has the two worlds spinning in anticipation.
The Made-in-Italy luxury goods sector is abuzz over whether Marchionne's ambition could facilitate the creation of an alliance of high-end producers, one that might stand up to the French conglomerates like LVMH, while financial analysts are crunching numbers on the brand's potential value.
`'I actually think cars are almost incidental to Ferrari,'' Marchionne said last month when announcing plans to spin off Ferrari from its mass-market parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. `'It sounds sacrilegious. But it is truly a luxury brand.''
Persuading the investing community of that distinction could significantly multiply Ferrari's market value by putting it among a category of companies that squeeze value not just out of the quality of the materials and products, but also out of their allure.
Marchionne has room to leverage.
Although Ferrari's brand has been named the world's most recognizable for two straight years in a survey by London-based consultants Brand Finance, it is only 350th in value, around $4 billion.
Lifting that figure is Marchionne's goal between now and the IPO, due in the second or third quarter next year.
A surge in Fiat's share price by as much as 30 percent since the Ferrari spinoff was announced indicates the potential of the deal, although most analysts aren't buying Marchionne's estimate that Ferrari is worth 10 billion euros ($12.5 billion). Max Warburton of Bernstein Research puts the figure around 5- 6 billion euros.
Getting a higher valuation is a tricky balance between finding new sources of sales to increase revenues and protecting the brand's exclusivity.
`'If you think of the capacity of the Ferrari brand in the luxury space, there are many avenues you can take from a product perspective,'' said Anil Valsan, an EY automotive analyst. `'But at the same time you have to be very careful about not damaging the brand. It is absolutely critical that the brand's value is not lost by diversifying into too many products.''
Currently, its revenue stream is limited by the fact that it keeps car sales to just 7,000 a year to retain an aura of exclusivity. Also, manufacturing high-performance engines and race cars is more capital intensive than, say, fashion.
Ferrari could take a gamble and expand its range of car offerings to include SUVs, a well-performing segment globally. That would bring its automotive portfolio closer in line with competitors Porsche or Bentley. Lamborghini, another Italian sports car maker, has previewed a concept SUV.
Already the brand presents itself as a luxury producer, with such services as on-sight atelier for Ferrari buyers to customize their sports cars and a race track for Ferrari owner test drives.
But analysts say there is more the company can do to monetize that image. One strategy could be creating an exclusive Ferrari club that could eventually be expanded to hotels catering to Ferrari owners and very high net worth individuals, said Brand Finance executive Robert Haigh.
In addition, the Ferrari World theme park _ which is being expanded from Abu Dhabi to Barcelona _ could be taken global, capitalizing on Ferrari's reputation for cutting-edge technology, he said.
And while Ferrari is already selling branded fashion items _ 399-euro ($494) carbon frame Oakley sunglasses, 445-euro ($550) watches and a 1,250-euro ($1,546) LaFerrari lamb nappa leather jacket _ not all products bearing the Formula 1 Scuderia logo are of the same high quality.
`'There are Ferrari caps, rubbish jackets and watches that are not necessarily expensive or well-made,'' Haigh said. `'They are not necessarily protecting the Scuderia brand the way they should be.''
That includes getting back to winning on the Formula 1 circuit _ one of the points of contention that led to the putsch of long-time Chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo after Marchionne publicly complained about Ferrari's recent track record.
Barclays analyst Kristina Church calculates that if Marchionne is able to position Ferrari as a luxury brand, then the `'bull case valuation stretches to 7.1 billion euros'' for the company.
Meanwhile, the luxury world has speculated that Ferrari's new plans could increase cooperation among Italy's luxury brands, which are for the most part independent operators in the hands of their creative founders and lacking economies of scale.
Marchionne has already shown his interest in bringing car-making and fashion together by putting fashion designer Ermenegildo Zegna on the board of Fiat Chrysler, with an eye to helping its upscale brands Alfa Romeo and Maserati. Under his watch, Zegna has designed a limited edition interior for the Maserati Quattroporte and Gucci has styled a 500.
Giorgio Armani , asked backstage at his last round of shows about the prospect of creating a Made in Italy luxury group, said that `'putting together the most beautiful Italian brands is fascinating.''
`'Everything depends on the quality of the product, on who would want to join,'' he said.

A: Oil prices are collapsing. Consumers are pouring less of their money into their gas tanks. That should be good for the economy and stocks, right?
Not exactly. The stock market is strugging this month as the decline in oil prices intensifies. There are several reasons for this. First is the direct hit. Lower gasoline prices result in lower prices of shares of energy stocks, which are a big contributor to the markets. Exxon Mobil (XOM) is the fourth most valuable company in the Standard & Poor’s 500 so when its shares tumble, that hurts the broad market. Shares of Exxon are down more than 12% this year, creating a big downward draft for the other companies to overcome. The S&P SmallCap 600 Energy index is down a crushing 50% from its level back in June, says Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. But it’s not just a speculator and stock-trader event. Analysts have been slashing their earnings forecasts for just about every energy company. Lower energy prices are a problem for nearly all energy companies with the exploration companies getting hit the worst. And that’s a problem. During the third quarter, the energy sector generated about a third of of the S&P 500’s total earnings of $30.03 share, says S&P Capital IQ.

New Delhi: Russia on Thursday agreed in principle to assemble around 400 advanced twin engine Kamov helicopters a year in India, in a major move to give a new push to their strategic partnership.
The Kamov Ka-226T, which Russia offered to assemble in India, is a light multi-role helicopter which is used for search-and-rescue operations.
The issue was discussed during the summit talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russia has also offered civilian aircraft Sukhoi Superjet-100 and MS-21 aircraft to India.
According to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, almost 400 Kamov helicopters a year will be assembled in India. He said Russia may consider producing Mi-17 transport helicopter in India as well.
At a joint media interaction with Putin, Modi said they discussed a broad range of new defence projects and how to align the defence relations to India's own priorities, including 'Make in India'.
"I am pleased that Russia has offered to fully manufacture in India one of its most advanced helicopters. It includes the possibility of exports from India. It can be used for both military and civilian use. We will follow up on this quickly," Modi said.
The Prime Minister said Russia has been India's foremost defence partner through decades and it will remain so.
"Even as India's options have increased today, Russia will remain our most important defence partner. We have conducted joint exercises across all three wings of the Armed Forces in the last six months," he said.
Russian officials said an in-principle decision was made on assembling of Russian helicopters in India. "Almost 400 Kamov helicopters a year will be turned out," Interfax news agency quoted Rogozin as saying.

Discoms put a spin on lossesUpdated: December 11, 2014 23:50 IST
Discoms put a spin on losses
Staff Reporter
electricity production and distribution
They may have been trying to bury commercial losses underneath the unmetered supply for agriculture. The report noted that the agricultural subsidy is growing by the year due to increase in Cost of Supply (CoS) to agricultural category, and increase in agricultural sales.
Free power for agriculture is usually blamed for major portion of the losses that the discoms incur. But in reality, it may be that the discoms are trying to bury commercial losses underneath the unmetered supply for agriculture. In effect, subsidy for agricultural consumption could actually be subsidising energy theft.
Widely known among transmission and distribution circles, this phenomenon has recently found a mention in the report of the task force on energy, which has not minced words in suggesting metering of all distribution transformers, including those supplying for agriculture, under the measures for reducing subsidy burden.
As a long-term measure, the distribution transformers supplying power to agriculture should be metered, the report suggested, and said it would help in segregating agriculture sales from losses, thereby revealing the actual loss levels of the discoms.
As admitted by the discom sources, the Operations officials from various circles take the liberty of showing a great amount of commercial losses under the head of the agricultural consumption, taking advantage of the fact that both are unmetered. Commercial losses, on the other hand, arise out of theft and illegal practices by consumers of various categories.
The report noted that the agricultural subsidy is growing by the year due to increase in Cost of Supply (CoS) to agricultural category, and increase in agricultural sales.
The CoS has increased from Rs. 3.58 per unit in 2011-12 to Rs. 5.2 per unit in 2013-14 for TSSPDCL, and from Rs. 3.82 to Rs. 5.51 for TSNPDCL.
For both the discoms together, approved sales have gone up to 9,837 MU from 8,943 MU during the same period, and the subsidy, from Rs. 3,288 crore to Rs. 5,238 crore.
If the trend continues, agricultural subsidy requirement could cross Rs. 10,000 crore mark in the coming five years, the report warned.
Resurvey of the agricultural services for identifying genuine beneficiaries, and implementation of High Voltage Distribution System on larger scale were suggested as remedial measures, apart from demand side management measures such as mandatory installation of capacitors, insistence on using ISI marked pump-sets, and installation of solar pump-sets.
