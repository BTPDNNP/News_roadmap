It s time govt started taking decisions: Deepak ParekhIt's time govt started taking decisions: Deepak Parekh
Shyamal Majumdar & Manojit Saha | Mumbai Oct 10, 2014 12:58 AM IST
Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India’s largest mortgage lender, says the exuberance in industry about the new government is justified but big ideas articulated by the prime minister need speedy implementation. In an interview with Shyamal Majumdar & Manojit Saha, he also backed the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to hold interest rates and said he expected only a marginal rate cut in 2015. Edited excerpts:
Do you share the general exuberance in industry about the new government?
I do not think the exuberance is irrational. The quarterly growth rate is higher, inflation is relatively low, commodity prices are falling, oil prices are the lowest in five years, the current account deficit level is comfortable, gold imports have come down and diesel subsidy has almost vanished.
We are waiting for the government to say diesel prices will be market-determined. We, in fact, expect diesel prices to come down after the state elections.
Do you see any dark spots?
Uncertainty hurts and, therefore, should go. It is time the government started taking decisions. For instance, coal. No one knows what is going to happen (after the court decision on deallocation of mines). Coal India is making statements that it does not want to take those mines because it does not have staff to manage those. It does not have a chairman for a long time. These are not “big-bang reforms”.
Also, a decision on gas pricing has been postponed twice already. This means fertiliser and power plants do not get gas. How can you run a country like this? You have to move on. Take a decision, whatever it is. Look at BSNL, which is another Air India in the making. BSNL has accumulated losses of Rs 22,000 crore. MTNL is also suffering losses, though private telecom companies are making money. How long will government funds be used to pay the monthly salaries of Air India employees? These are decisions that need to be taken.
What is your take on the ‘Make in India’ programme?
‘Make in India’ is a good idea, as it is aimed at boosting manufacturing. But it will remain on paper if you continue to have difficulty in getting land and labour. We need to liberalise land acquisition and labour laws. The prime minister is saying everywhere that he will make doing business easy. The ease of doing businesses involves infrastructure, land and labour. The PM is also talking about single-window clearance for projects; all these ideas need to be implemented now.
When are you expecting big-bang reforms to come?
Big bang reforms are complex. Like labour law reforms and the Goods & Services Tax, which are still being opposed by a few Bharatiya Janata Party-run states. It is a big task for the finance minister because he has to implement GST by 2015.
Let us focus on decisions. For example, the Budget says we will get Rs 58,000 crore from disinvestments. But we have hardly got any so far. If you wait for the last day, it is not going to work. You cannot bunch Rs 50,000 crore in two months. You do not need any reforms for these things; it all boils down to decisions.
Do you still believe housing prices in India are inflated? There has been some correction of late.
Inflated means that you have to see the real estate price and compare it with the salaries of people, and affordability. Can the citizens of Mumbai aspire to own a property in the city? It is impossible. That is why I said housing prices were still inflated. It is because of land prices. If you make a building in South Mumbai today, 90 per cent of the cost would be for land. So, land policies are faulty. You have to release more land.
Our politicians should have the will. For example, even if you own land and want to build a house on it, it will take you two years to get the approvals. And, you have to go to 40 different agencies for approval. If your plans are within the norms, you should get it in two months. There is too much of corruption or speed money.
What is your outlook on the rupee?
The rupee has stabilised, though it has weakened a little lately. I think money is still coming, despite some profit-booking. There has been a bit of a slowdown in inflows from foreign institutional investors. But I am sure if we announce some big reforms, inflows will come. Remember, India is a large market and has a large capacity to absorb. Look at Indonesia, Thailand or the Philippines; what is their absorption capacity for FII money?
You have always been the government’s go-to man. Are you open to working for the present government in some capacity? Have you been approached?
My weakness is that I cannot say no. That is why I got roped into so many committees. I do not think the new government has set up many committees to date. As for your second question, I have not been approached by the new government.
Regarding consumer demand, industry players say the vibes are good but things are not going to improve in the next two to three quarters. What is your view?
I disagree with that. What consumers are looking for are good deals. Why has e-commerce become such a success? If consumers are going to websites to buy, the key is logistics. We do not have enough people to deliver it.
We expect automobile sales to be in double digits in the next three months. Consumer credit penetration in India is very low. Outstanding housing loan as a percentage of gross domestic product is only nine per cent, compared with two per cent 35 years ago. This ratio in our neighbouring countries is in the 30s and 40s. So, this growth is going to be phenomenal. And, with a stress on financial inclusion, accessibility of people to banks will only increase.
On a year-on-year basis, credit growth has so far been below 10 per cent, the lowest since 2001. When do you expect bank loans to pick up?
The poor credit growth is a result of the previous period. Last financial year (2013-14) was the worst year. So the credit growth cannot happen. I am expecting it to pick up significantly, to 16-17 per cent like earlier, in the next financial year.
Deposit growth has also been on the lower side. Earlier, we had 17-18 per cent deposit growth. But that has come down due to inflation. It is because food cost, transport cost, etc, have gone up. As a result, people are spending more; savings’ share in GDP has fallen from 34 per cent in 2000 to 31 per cent now.
But no new projects are coming up and revival of stalled projects is still very slow. What makes you think that credit growth will pick up next year?
Consumer credit is going to rise. All stalled projects will require money. If they get permissions, there will be demand for credit. In many stalled projects, banks did not release the sanctioned amount because the projects got stuck for various reasons, such as input linkage. Capacity is increasing in every sector.
High interest rates, too, are hurting loan demand. When do you see the central bank beginning to lower policy rates?
There may be a marginal rate cut in 2015. You cannot expect sharp cuts, as inflation is still a major concern. No doubt that inflation has come down, but it is still beyond the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) comfort zone. In any case, a change of half a percentage point in interest rates is not going to improve industrial production. The fall in inflation has to be sustainable for lowering rates.
RBI has given only two new bank licences and settled for differentiated licences. What is your view on this? Should business houses be allowed in banking?
Small banks and payment banks will certainly be helpful in extending financial inclusion. I personally feel RBI took the right view in not giving bank licences to industrial houses in the previous round of licensing process. There is the issue of conflict of interest. In addition, if a business conglomerate that produces, say, steel, and also does banking, no other steel producer will go to it for loans. Why should a competitor want to present its business model to a rival?
In India, banking is very fragmented. Is there a case for consolidation?
We have a large number of small banks. What we need is a small number of large banks. If you see the top 10 global banks in terms of market capitalisation, you will have a Russian Bank, a Chinese Bank and a Brazilian Bank. An Indian bank will come at, perhaps, number 200. There is a clear case for consolidation. But I must say it has its own problems. One idea of consolidation is more efficiency and better cost control. But we cannot afford to reduce manpower, as we are not a developed economy and do not have a social security.
We need to have larger banks, as Indian industry has grown faster than the banking industry. Quite a few banks have exhausted their group exposure limits to large companies because banks are allowed to lend only a certain percentage of their net worth. The large Indian companies have to go outside to use big banks’ balance sheets.
Do you think the relaxation in reserve requirements for financing infrastructure and housing pave the way for a merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank?
It certainly helps. But, on the other hand, availability of seven-year money is limited in India. Large long-term bond markets are not there. How many people are interested in investing for seven years? Insurance companies look for long-term assets. But Indian insurance firms are not that big yet. Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has compulsions to invest more in government securities. And, that is one of the reasons why private-sector bond market has not been created.
Do you think there is still some pain left in commercial real estate?
A lot of commercial real estate is still vacant. Rates have come down significantly and will go down further because there is a lot of surplus. On the residential side, developers are not willing to bring prices down. So, there has not been any significant correction. Buyers were not buying last year; everyone was sitting on the fence and expecting prices to come down. Many builders put a clause that if we sell in future at a lower price, we will make it applicable to you. So, it is unlikely that residential real estate prices will come down sharply, that is by 10-20 per cent.

Vodafone has asked the government to allocate the spectrum it won eight months ago and extend the validity of the licence by six months, according to company officials.
The company will land in a major problem if the government does not hand over the 1,800 MHz spectrum it won in the last major auction held in February. This spectrum is supposed to replace the 900 MHz spectrum whose validity expires in less than two months. “Under the current situation with very little time left and any replacement of 900 MHz [with 1,800 MHz which has not yet been earmarked] on the prescribed date is bound to considerably impact services despite the company’s best efforts….the changeover under normal circumstances could take at least six months after the earmarking of frequencies,’’ said a company official.

Alpha coal mine is located in the Galilee Basin with the first coal lot expected to be extracted by 2016
Hyderabad-based GVK group on Thursday said it had won environmental permit for its Alpha coal project in Australia to help it get closer to starting work on a long-delayed $10 billion mine, rail and port project.
GVK Hancock, a 79:21 joint venture between GVK and Australian billionaire Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting, now needs to get coal rail operator Aurizon Holdings onboard and sign coal sales agreement to being work on the project.
“After over six years of comprehensive environmental assessments and detailed planning, GVK Hancock has been granted an Environmental Authority (Clearance) for its Alpha Coal Project in the Galilee Basin in Central Queensland,” the company said in a statement. GVK’s Alpha Coal Mine is located in the Galilee Basin with the first coal lot expected to be extracted by 2016. When fully commissioned, the mine will produce 32 million tonnes of thermal a year of low ash, low sulphur coal for export to the Asian market. The Land Court of Queensland in Australia had earlier granted conditional clearance to the Alpha Coal Mine project.
“This is one of the most significant milestones in the development of our Galilee Basin coal projects till date which will create one of the most remarkable pieces of regional and economic developments Queensland has seen for decades,” GVK Reddy, founder Chairman of GVK, said. “This milestone takes us another step closer towards commencing our proposed Alpha mine, which will create around 4,000 jobs during its three-year construction, GVK Vice Chairman G. V. Sanjay Reddy said in the statement.

Tech Has a Diversity ProblemThis  article  originally appeared in  Wired .
When you question the lack of diversity in the tech world, you often get the same response. It goes something like this: Tech companies are predominantly white and male, not because tech companies are racist or sexist, but because most applicants for tech jobs are white men. These companies, the voices say, are simply hiring the best applicants for the jobs.
That may sound like a poor excuse. But according to Maxine Williams, the head of global diversity at Facebook, it’s true. The homogenous talent pool is a prime reason for the race and gender imbalance in tech, she explains, and hiring based on race and gender alone is the wrong way to fix the problem. But there are other ways of fixing it, she says. That is her job.

If companies like Facebook want to be more diverse, Williams says, it’s incumbent upon them to expand the size and scope of the applicant pool. That way, when they say they’re hiring the best person for the job, they can really mean it. “As far as we’re concerned, our strategy needs to be going to them, instead of expecting we will build it and they will come,” she tells Wired.
Diversity has been a hot topic in tech lately, especially after companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter decided to publish reports exposing stark demographic imbalances within their companies. Generally, at these tech giants, women account for only about 30 percent of staff. But each report came with somber commitments from the companies to do better. And in some ways, they already have.
“As far as we’re concerned, our strategy needs to be going to them, instead of expecting we will build it and they will come.”
Maxine Williams, Facebook’s head of global diversity
On Wednesday, Code.org, a nonprofit group committed to teaching kids to code, announced it had partnered with dozens of companies, including Facebook, to raise money and awareness for an initiative called Hour of Code, which aims to teach 100 million kids to code. That same day,  at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing , Facebook, Pinterest, and Box launched a mentoring program called WEST—Women Entering and Staying in Tech.
But according to Williams, initiatives like these aren’t just reactions to the sudden focus on diversity metrics. It’s the kind of thing she’s been working on all along. Since joining Facebook in 2013, Williams has been dreaming up pointed ways of diversifying Facebook’s applicant pool, from touring America’s more racially diverse colleges to working with nonprofit groups, and recently launching a little-known pilot project that sends Facebook ads about coding and computer science to young women just entering college.
It’s all part of a growing realization within the company that Facebook needs a diverse workforce to stay relevant as a global company. “If you think about the product we create and who the people are who use Facebook, 87 percent of them are not in North America. So they do not look like Mark Zuckerberg, or the type of people you typically associate with Facebook,” she says. “If we don’t get this thing right, why on earth would people choose us?”
Cognitive Diversity
When Williams talks about diversity, it’s important to note she means diversity of life experiences, so-called “cognitive diversity.” Research repeatedly has shown that teams with diverse perspectives are stronger teams. But it just so happens that things like gender and race—the stuff that makes us visibly diverse—have a big impact on those life experiences and perspectives. That’s why Williams spends a lot of time looking for ways to bring women and minorities to Facebook’s applicant pool.
For instance, the company recently launched its so-called “Be Bold. Move Fast” tour, in which Williams and her team visited colleges with large percentages of women and minority students, places like Howard University and Spellman College. On the tour, they met with school presidents and student focus groups in an attempt to understand how the tech industry is perceived at these schools.
“Every time you do that, you’re reminded that Silicon Valley is just one small space in a much bigger, more complex world,” says Williams, who hails from Trinidad and Tobago.
Along the way, Williams says she found that at many of these schools, not even teachers and counselors have a clear understanding of what the tech industry has to offer. Therefore, they don’t steer students in that direction. “We realized we have a lot to do on the exposure front,” says Williams. “We want to give people the opportunity to rise to the occasion, but first, they need to know there’s an occasion.”
Facebook University
Facebook already runs an internship program for college freshmen called Facebook University, which is aimed at recruiting women and minority students. Now, it’s also developing what it’s calling an “influencers” program to help parents, teachers, and guardians understand the job opportunities that exist in tech.

I've worked at many tech companies. They all, every single one, were populated with lots and lots of Indians, Pakistanis, Arabs, Iranians, Chinese, Koreans, Thais, Cambodians, et al. Extremely diverse in terms of cultural background, languages, etc.   More...

Another way Facebook hopes to increase exposure to the tech sector is through its own platform. The company recently launched a pilot program targeting coding and computer science ads to young women who are going to or already attending college. When students click on the ad, it brings them to a page full of videos and other information on computer science programs in schools across the country. It’s Facebook’s way, Williams says, of using its vast reach to expand the pool. “Some of it won’t have a direct correlation to who we can hire right now at Facebook,” she says, “but we think it will have an impact on who we can hire in the future.”
But for all her efforts to diversify the applicant pool, Williams insists no one is getting preferential treatment in hiring. “I want to see the most diverse pool possible apply. But once you’ve applied, you’re held to the same bar,” she says, adding, “but unless we put the effort in to see options in the applicant pool, we won’t have a choice. We’re just fishing in the same pond.”

From chubby to charming  my style journeyShare 0
Unconventional Arjun Kapoor Busy Finding Fanny!
He was a chubby kid who couldn’t fit into high street clothes (forget designer). Now at the forefront of Bollywood’s new breed of stylish actors, Arjun Kapoor reveals to GQ his sartorial rules and why you might just find him next on Savile Row. 
My personal style? Either vagabond or James Bond. 
 
I push the envelope and experiment with fashion. But sometimes, big brands don’t have my size and I feel too embarrassed to ask for it to be custom-made. 
 
Blazers with a T-shirt and coloured pants are failsafe. I also wore suede loafers with tassels recently and they looked great. If you asked me a year ago, I wouldn’t be caught dead in anything with tassels or in suede. 
 
I’m brand conscious. I like spending money, but I spend it wisely, on the right brands. I look for durability and don’t invest in a brand just because it’s in vogue. 
 
Dolce & Gabbana are great for buying white or navy shirts, which you can play up and contrast with coloured pants. Also, you can’t go wrong with black and white. 
 
I want to go to Savile Row and get suits made. Suits are something that excite me. For Koffee with Karan, I was very keen to wear a green-coloured suit so I wore one by Paul Smith and paired it with a floral shirt. 
 
Raghavendra Rathore is one of my favourite designers. I don’t hesitate to pick up the phone and call him every time I need something because I trust his fit and finish blindly. His bandhgalas are phenomenal. 
 
I’m addicted to watches. I’m wearing an IWC timepiece now and own a Breitling and Hublot as well.
 
I’m a compulsive shopper and pick up stuff in excess. I don’t think twice about something I’m going to buy, I just pick it up impulsively. 
 
Dior Homme makes really nice sneakers and I’m a big fan. I have four pairs of Onitsuka Tiger shoes. Off-duty, I’m most comfortable in flip-flops. 
 
I’m discovering my style by trial and error. Sometimes you think you’re looking really nice and people compliment you for it but it doesn’t necessarily translate on camera. For instance, I like minimal checked suits but it doesn’t catch on camera or if you wear a salmon-pink shirt, it might look like bubble-gum pink. I can’t control that but I don’t let it bring my style down. 
 
Suit, shirt, cufflinks, belt, loafers; all by Gucci, prices on request.

Cap of 3 free ATM transaction only for metros: RBICap of 3 free ATM transactions only for metros, says RBI
Nupur Anand | Mumbai Oct 10, 2014 11:47 PM IST
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has clarified that free transactions at non-home bank ATMs would come down to three from five only if all the transactions are carried out in the metros. These six metros include Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad.
The regulator has clarified that this new rule will not apply in case the transactions are being carried out both in metros and non-metros.
“If transactions are carried out at both, the six metro centres and other locations, the total number of transactions (inclusive of both financial and non-financial) free of charge at other bank ATMs would continue to remain at five,” said RBI in a circular.
This new regulation is set to be effective from November 1.
According to the new regulation, banks are also free to charge their customers for ATM transactions beyond five a month, though a board-approved policy on this issue would have to be put in place.
However, RBI has said that lenders are free to offer more number of free transactions per month at other bank ATMs as well as their own ATMs in any geographical location.
Banks are also free to decide on the combination (for metro & non-metro locations) of free transactions while adhering the minimum requirement, added the circular.

Renowned Bharatnatyam danseuse Leela Samson has resigned as chairperson of Sangeet Natak Akademi.
Minister of State for Culture Shripad Yesso Naik was quoted by Press Trust of India saying that her resignation, which was received on September 30, has been accepted.
Senior Ministry bureaucrats and Ms. Samson, who has a year of her tenure left, were tight-lipped although sources confirmed the development.
Ms. Samson, who was earlier Director of Kalakshetra Foundation in Chennai, continues as the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification although she has completed the three-year term. In 2012, the order of reinstatement of Ms. Samson as Kalakshetra Foundation Director was set aside by the Madras High Court.
Interestingly, the terms of several members of the executive board of the Sangeet Natak Akademi have also expired and once Ms. Samson formally moves out, no major decisions can be taken until a new leadership is put in place. The Akademi is an autonomous body fully funded by the Ministry of Culture.

Will the rupee remain steadyWill the rupee remain steady?
Somasroy Chakraborty | Kolkata Oct 10, 2014 09:35 PM IST
The volatility in the exchange rate of the rupee appears to be in the past. The dollar has continued to climb against major currencies but the rupee has been unusually stable against the greenback for the better part of this financial year. The formation of a stable government at the Centre, reinforcing hope of economic recovery, has led to strong inflow of foreign capital.
The rupee, thus, has mostly remained in the range of 58-61 to the dollar between May and September. In contrast, the US dollar index – which measures its performance against a basket of six major currencies – has strengthened from 79 to nearly 86 during this period, about nine per cent.
“The real story of the rupee so far has been its relative outperformance over other major currencies,” said Rohit Bhasin, head of fixed income and currency at Deutsche Bank in India. He believes this will sustain, as the Reserve Bank of India’s focus on inflation is providing a lot of confidence to offshore investors.
Not all agree. They feel the scope for further debt money (40 per cent of the $34 billion year-to-date portfolio flows into India) coming here is limited, with most of the open $25 billion quota for government bonds already taken up. The recent rally in the equity market has also moderated return expectations.
Unless the debt quota is raised or the government unleashes major reforms that further boost investors’ confidence, the inflow of dollars might get limited. In fact, the possibility of a reversal is real, say many. The euphoria surrounding India’s reforms is somewhat ebbing, while the US Federal Reserve is expected to increase rates sooner than later. “Our export growth is not strong and macro fundamentals remain weak. The rupee’s relative outperformance might not last once capital flows start reversing,” said an economist.
Although declining crude oil and benign gold prices are a positive and mean lesser outflow of forex from India, the government has also maintained restrictions and duties on gold imports, which artificially support the rupee. Some say the rupee has already started to trade with a weaker undertone, recognising the sharp rise in the US dollar index, which touched a 52-month high of 86.746 on October 3 after the data indicated a drop in their jobless rate.
There is also a school of thought that the rupee is becoming overvalued. One economist notes the 36-currency basket REER (real effective exchange rate) for the rupee at end-September was at 109.70, compared to its long-term average of 104.90. Overvaluation can create a false sense of stability and encourages companies to leave their foreign currency exposures unhedged, a risk RBI has already sensed.
If the stability in the US fixed income market is disturbed, the rupee’s outperformance will be threatened.

Global growth weakens wary marketsGlobal growth weakens wary markets
Sneha Padiyath | Mumbai Oct 10, 2014 06:46 PM IST
Worries of sluggish growth in the European and Chinese economies played spoil-sport in the Indian markets on a day when technology-giant Infosys posted impressive second quarter numbers.
Even as the index-heavyweight Infosys rose by 7% on Friday, the benchmarks Sensex and Nifty fell by over 1.3% as investors booked profits following negative cues from the global markets.
On Friday, the NSE Nifty closed at 7,859 down 100 points. The BSE Sensex fell by about 340 points posting its third week of losses. It closed at 26,297 down about 2.9% for the last three weeks. During that period foreign portfolio investors have been net-sellers at Rs 2,791 crore.
Participants said that foreign investors having bought heavily in the rally of the past few months are carrying forward lighter positions and booking profits at every rise. On Friday, foreign portfolio investors were net-sellers at Rs 719 crore. Domestic institutions were net-buyers at Rs 558 crore.
Even as the outlook for India remains unchanged, Indian markets have been displaying signs of weakness because of the high valuations in the system, analysts said.
"Market is significantly exuberant in terms of valuations. Results in this and the following quarters will disappoint because of the expectations built into valuations," said Dhananjay Sinha, co-head (institutional research), Emkay Global Financial Services.
Barring the IT and Teck sectors, most sectoral indices on the BSE ended the day in the red. The BSE metal index was down the most at over 4% followed by the BSE auto and FMCG indices which were down over 2.5%.
Dipen Shah, senior vice-president of Kotak Securities believes that the long-term outlook for the country remains positive but events in the global markets would have a higher impact on Indian equities in the short-term.
"General sentiment in the market is negative because of global weakness. The slowdown in the European and China continues to be a worry," said Shah.
On Friday, major Asian indices fell on reports of lower growth in the Europe region and also on cancelation of talks in Hong Kong between the pro-democracy protestors and government. The Hang Seng, Hong Kong's benchmark index, fell by about 7%. Other Korean and Japanese benchmarks were down about 5% each.
European indices witnessed sharper declines of 6-10% after the IMF cuts its growth forecast for the region and differences emerged between the European Central Bank and Germany over the continuation of the stimulus programme for the regions. Further, the German industrial output fell the most since 2009.
Among the Sensex stocks, the BSE Tata Motors declined the most, by 5.3%. Hindalco and Sesa Sterlite were shed about 5% while Tata Steel and Mahindra&Mahindra were down 4 and 3.5% each.

Smart cities  speed trains in next budget: M...Arvind Mayaram
(The Budget 2015-16 will…)
WASHINGTON: The Budget 2015-16 will include many of the schemes announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi such as smart cities and high speed trains, Finance Secretary Arvind Mayaram said today.
The Finance Ministry has already initiated the exercise for Budget 2015-16 by seeking inputs from various Ministries and Departments.
"What you'll see is a lot of action which is preparatory to the budget but includes many of the announcements that the Prime Minister has made recently," he said in an interview to the Wall Street Journal newspaper.
The ministries have been asked to submit revised estimates of expenditure for 2014-15 and demand for grants for the next financial year beginning April 1, 2015. This would be the second Budget of the Modi government .
Prescribing timelines for submission of proposals, discussion with Secretaries and finalisation of demand for grants, the ministry has asked officials to strictly adhere to the schedule.
The ministries have been asked to submit revised estimates of expenditure for 2014-15 and demand for grants for the next financial year beginning April 1, 2015.
Mayaram also said that work is under way on various infrastructure building projects such as smart cities, high speed rail and industrial corridors.
Mayaram is in Washington to participate in an annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
"The actions that you're seeing unfolding are all part of this bigger story...These small pieces are fitting in to make this big picture," he said.
On global oil prices, the Secretary said a spike in the prices could weigh severely on India's books.
"If there are no shocks of that nature...then we don't think that there's going to be a problem as far as revenues are concerned," he added.

767 5th Avenue, Suite 4700
New York, NY 10153
 
Dear Tim,
As a large Apple shareholder with approximately 53 million shares, we applaud you and the rest of management, especially in light of recent launches and announcements which further validate our view that you are the ideal CEO for Apple. It is truly a watershed moment, with Apple poised to take market share from Google (Android) in the premium device market as iPhone 6 becomes Apple’s flagship device among a growing collection of products and services that work together to form an increasingly dominant mobile ecosystem. We believe this advantaged position over Google, the company’s only real competitor, justifies our forecasts for revenue and EPS (earnings per share) growth of 25% and 44% respectively for FY (fiscal year) 2015. This strong competitive position and earnings growth compels us to remind you that Apple, adjusting for net cash, currently sells at a P/E (price to earnings per share ratio) of only 8x our FY 2015 forecast, a significantly lower P/E than a broad market index, the S&P 500, which trades today at a P/E of 15x FY 2015 consensus. In contrast to the S&P 500’s slower growth, we expect Apple to grow its EPS by 30% in each of FY 2016 and FY 2017. Assuming these growth characteristics for FY 2016 and FY 2017, we see Apple’s P/E of just 8x our FY 2015 forecast as both irrational and transient in nature, especially since many actively managed mutual funds remain underweight Apple in their portfolios. Our forecasted growth for FY 2016 and FY 2017 more than adequately justifies using a P/E multiple of 19x our FY 2015 forecast, which along with net cash values Apple at $203 per share today. Described in more detail below, these factors combine to reflect a massive undervaluation of Apple in today’s market, which we believe will not last for long. Therefore, given the persistently excessive liquidity of $133 billion net cash on Apple’s balance sheet, we ask you to present to the rest of the Board our request for the company to make a tender offer, which would meaningfully accelerate and increase the magnitude of share repurchases. We thank you for being receptive to us the last time we requested an increase in share repurchases, and we thank you in advance now for any influence you may choose to have communicating to the rest of the Board the degree to which a tender offer would have a positive impact on an EPS basis for all shareholders. To preemptively diffuse any cynical criticism that you may encounter with respect to our request, which might claim that we are requesting a tender offer with the intention of tendering our own shares, we hereby commit not to tender any of our shares if the company consummates any form of a tender offer at any price. We commit to this because we believe Apple remains dramatically undervalued. And we think you and the Board agree. If you did not, you would not continue to repurchase shares under the existing authorization. You have said before that the company likes to be “opportunistic” when repurchasing shares and we appreciate that. With this letter we simply hope to express to you that now is a very opportunistic time to do so. We think a tender offer is simply a good method of conducting a large repurchase in an expedited timeframe, but the exact method and the exact size is not the key issue for us. We are simply asking you to help us convince the board to repurchase a lot more, and sooner. We feel compelled to do so because we forecast such impressive earnings growth over the next few years, and therefore we believe Apple is dramatically undervalued in today’s market, and the more shares repurchased now, the more each remaining shareholder will benefit from that earnings growth.
Critical to our forecast for strong earnings growth is the belief that the iPhone will take significant premium market share. Given historically high retention rates, we assume existing iPhone users will continue to act like an annuity, choosing to stay with the iPhone each time they upgrade. But now, since the iPhone 6 is the most significant improvement to the iPhone since its introduction, we expect users of competitive products to see the iPhone 6/6+ as an exciting opportunity to choose a superior product. Now that iPhone offers a larger screen size, its price competitiveness in the premium phone market is clear, as a premium Android phone such as the Galaxy S5 and Note 4 sells at a similar price point to the iPhone 6 and 6+ respectively. The choice between them is analogous to the choice between a Volkswagen over a Mercedes at the same price, and unlike a Mercedes, the $649 cost of an iPhone 6 is affordable for the mass market, equating to just $20 per month over a two year period (including a $170 estimated resale value of the phone at the end of two years, excluding financing and taxes). We see the iPhone remaining unaffected by the “junk”, as you called it, sold at lower price points, but we also see it dominating the entire class of premium Android smartphones, such as Samsung’s Galaxy phones. Because of this, we expect Apple will take premium market share, while at the same time maintaining its prices and gross margins, proving the concept of commoditization is nothing more than a myth with regards to Apple. Beyond simple price comparison, we see the iPhone as best in class, supported by expert reviews and by the lines of people all over the world waiting to buy it. Perhaps most importantly, we believe the iPhone will take market share because its merits are no longer viewed in isolation from the overall Apple ecosystem of products and services, which include iOS, iPad, Mac, Apps, App Store, iCloud, iTunes, and (more recently) Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Home, Health, Continuity, Beats. With the iPhone as the foundation, Apple’s ecosystem has come to play an important role in the daily life of Apple users, and while Apple continues to make impressive strides to improve it, the competition falls behind in what is arguably the most important race of this technological era. Analogizing Apple to a modern day Secretariat, as this race continues, the further the distance grows between Apple and Google (and Google’s hardware partners) in the premium device category. Its leading ecosystem of products and services, added to peerless hardware design and quality, differentiates Apple from a simple hardware company. And, with its users consistently upgrading to the newest version of iOS (92% of iOS devices, iPhones and iPads, on iOS 7 prior to the launch of iOS 8), Apple is able to offer its users the most up to date software and service experience, while Android can’t because it’s hindered by relatively high fragmentation among its operating system versions. App developers appreciate the difference, which is why they often choose to make an App for iOS prior to (or instead of) Android. During a recent interview, you referred to Google and only Google as your competition, as no other operating system can gain enough scale in Apps to be relevant. Furthermore, you also described how, in contrast to Apple, Google’s business model relies on advertising, which will increasingly expose products that run Android to serious privacy concerns. Considering all of this, combined with their inability to merge a superior brand, hardware, software, services, fashion and retail stores, Google and its hardware partners will remain disadvantaged in the premium device market. As this is realized, we expect that Apple will gain market share, that those gains will translate into earnings growth in line with our forecasts, and in turn translate into multiple expansion.
In addition to iPhone 6 market share gains, we assume that earnings growth will be driven by successful innovations and launches of other products and platforms. To properly forecast future earnings for the purposes of valuation, we assume further innovation on existing product lines and services (such as the larger screen iPhone 6 and 6+), but also assume that launches of new product platforms and new services will happen, predict what they might be, and estimate and include the potential earnings from such innovation and launches into forecasted future-year earnings. As our model highlights, much like the success of iPhone and iPad before it, we expect the successful launch of new premium product platforms (the announced Apple Watch in FY 2015 and the rumored TV in FY 2016) along with new services (in particular Apple Pay). These new launches will further distance Apple’s ecosystem from its peers and accelerate revenue and earnings growth in excess of the status quo. For the next three fiscal years, we forecast robust earnings growth of 44%, 30%, and 30% respectively, driven by strong revenue growth of 25%, 21%, and 21% respectively. We detail below how we arrive at these forecasts.
 
iPhone
Composing 55% of net sales, iPhone is Apple’s largest product platform. Consumers have already responded with unparalleled enthusiasm to the new iPhones with millions of people waiting in lines all around the world to buy an iPhone 6 or 6+, and the positivity from expert reviewers and the press has been stronger than we have ever seen. Legendary reviewer Walt Mossberg simply stated, “This is the best smartphone you can buy, and I am unequivocal about that.” Now that Apple is offering larger phones with roughly the same size screen as competitors’ offerings, and targeting mainland China at the time of its 4G rollout, we expect Apple to take significant market share. As users roll off their existing wireless carrier contracts, they can choose a superior product at a comparable price. There are obviously lower priced competitive offerings, but the marginal premium one pays for an iPhone is not significant for meaningful percentages of the global population. As we explained earlier in this letter, the effective cost of an iPhone 6 is just $20 per month. Considering the increasing amount of time users spend with their mobile devices, and thereby the practical value of a noticeably superior product, it is hard to imagine why a consumer would choose an inferior phone when the marginal cost difference is so small. That is why we expect Apple to take market share not only from those competitors offering a phone at a similar price, but also those competitors offering phones at cheaper prices. As the quality of the Apple ecosystem (iPhone, iPad, Mac, iTunes, App Store) continues with new additions (Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Home, Health, Continuity, iCloud) to pull away from a relatively flawed and fragmented Android ecosystem, market share gains will continue. For next fiscal year, the new iPhone 6 and 6+ should drive iPhone revenue growth of 30%, due to volume growth of 22% (premium market share gains, category growth, upgrade cycle) and pricing growth of 7% (mix shift to the iPhone 6+ that sells for a $100 premium to both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 5s at this time last year). In the following years, FY 2016 and FY 2017, we expect volume growth of 7% and 10% respectively and flat average selling prices as Apple experiences no pricing pressure and continues to take market share.
 
iPad and Mac
Contributing 17% to net sales, iPad has experienced tremendous growth since its introduction in 2010. After a disappointing FY 2014, we believe the iPad will reaccelerate growth next year, especially if Apple, as rumored, offers a larger screen 12.9” iPad in FY 2015 and improves the offering of its 7.9” iPad Mini and its 9.7” iPad Air. We believe there is still a large growth opportunity for iPad, as you highlighted when you stated that “the PC market today is 315 million units” and “despite the iPad’s 76% market share of tablets sold to businesses, the penetration of tablets in businesses is low at 20% and, to put that in some kind of context, if you looked at the penetration of notebooks in business it would be over 60%.” With the recently announced partnership with IBM, which you suggested will “change how businesses work”, we believe iPad will increase its penetration of enterprise. For next fiscal year, the new iPad innovation and IBM partnership should drive iPad revenue growth of 13%, due to volume growth of 8% (innovation, larger iPad, IBM partnership) and pricing growth of 4% (mix shift to the rumored higher priced iPad). In each of the following years, FY 2016 and FY 2017, we expect revenue growth of 13% on relatively flat average selling prices as the ecosystem and IBM partnership continue to drive sales. Contributing 13% to net sales, Mac in contrast to the overall PC market, has grown market share to maintain its volume and sales. We expect Mac to continue this steady performance going forward and hold net sales flat over the next three years. While we are not yet prepared to make near term adjustments to raise our forecasts for the next three years, we do believe Apple may be able to innovate even further across the iPad/Mac platforms. Some see a larger iPad as a necessity if Apple is going to transform iOS into a hybrid desktop/tablet operating system by adding a keyboard/mouse centric user interface to iOS, while at the same time maintaining its touch-friendly user interface. With a near 13” model, Apple would have a screen size lineup that overlaps their Macbook Air line, a promising path into the $63 billion sub $1,000 laptop market in which Apple barely participates today, according to Rod Hall at JP Morgan.
 
iTunes, Software and Services, Accessories, and iPod
These three segments, contributing 10%, 3% and 1% to net sales respectively, fill out the remaining portion of Apple’s current net sales mix. iTunes, Software and Services are not only important to Apple’s ecosystem in terms of driving sales of its products, but also in terms of its own long term revenue growth. This represents one of Apple’s faster growing segments and one we expect to not only continue its double digit top line growth but also to disproportionately benefit gross margins as higher margin services (such as 100% margin App Store sales revenues) compose a greater portion of the sales. As for Accessories and iPod, we expect the impact of the acquisition of Beats and accessory growth moving forward to more than offset the continued decline of iPod, which is already relatively immaterial to net sales.
 
Apple Watch
Over the next three years, we expect the Apple Watch to have a significant impact on Apple’s growth. Apple’s first new product category since the iPad in 2010, and the company’s first foray into wearables, the Apple Watch will launch early next calendar year. It appears to us that Jony Ive and his team have yet again executed at a level that will bring to market a product that revolutionizes the entire category from both a hardware and software perspective, especially given that Apple has developed an entirely new operating system for this device, and catered to the notion that such a device needs to be far more fashionable and personal than other products currently available in this category. As an accessory to the iPhone (model 5 or thereafter), we believe we have included in our forecast sales for the Apple Watch that imply a reasonable attach rate to the iPhone, with unit sales volume resembling that of the iPad in scale, and ramping at a similar incline, selling 20 million units in FY 2015, 45 million units in FY 2016, 72.5 million units in 2017. Although the sales mix between collections, the attach rate of bands to each watch, and the related prices remain unknown, we expect the average selling price to exceed the entry level price of $350, forecasting an average selling price of $450 per unit, including the extra band.
 
UltraHD  Television
While Apple has not announced plans for a TV set and may never do so, we believe we have good enough reason to expect the introduction of an UltraHD TV set in FY 2016. We think television represents a large opportunity for Apple, one that reaches far beyond “the hobby” that Apple TV currently represents. You recently stated, “TV is an area of great interest for Apple” and we agree that it should be. As we highlighted in our previous letter, we believe UltraHD’s (ultra-high-definition television) superior picture quality in comparison to regular HD will drive a major TV replacement cycle as the price gap between them narrows. It should also be noted that Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, has referenced UltraHD as a major catalyst for Netflix going forward, and while this is true for Netflix, we believe it is also true for Apple. Against the backdrop of this replacement cycle, FY 2016 represents an opportune time to introduce an UltraHD TV set. Therefore, included in our forecasts, we expect Apple to sell 12 million 55” and 65” TV sets in FY 2016 and 25 million in FY 2017 at an average selling price of $1,500 at gross margins consistent with the overall company. While we think adding a TV set to the Apple ecosystem would be meaningful from a financial perspective, we understand that you may choose not to do so, as you have wisely stated that “the toughest choices for Apple are what not to work on.” But, even if Apple chooses not to offer a TV set, our earnings estimates would only be revised for FY 2016 and FY 2017, and the impact is not significant enough for us to question using a P/E multiple of 19x our FY 2015 EPS for Apple today, especially since, even without a TV set, our forecast shows EPS growth of 19% in FY 2016 and 23% in FY 2017. While the UltraHD replacement cycle alone offers a compelling revenue opportunity, the opportunity is not limited to the sales of an UltraHD TV. Televisions are a centerpiece to the modern living room and thereby a promising gateway into the home for Apple’s growing ecosystem. Apple could sell UltraHD movies and shows through iTunes over the internet to the UltraHD TV since cable companies will likely be slow to upgrade their expensive linear infrastructure, as one example of an incremental opportunity. Another is the user interface of television, which you humorously (but accurately, in our opinion) described as being “stuck in the 1970s.”
 
HomeKit and HealthKit
But like so many of Apple’s opportunities, an UltraHD TV is just one possible point of entry to a much broader overall opportunity, as the living room is just one room in the home and Apple’s growing ecosystem makes the entire home an approachable venue. For example, Apple’s recently released HomeKit, a framework in iOS 8 for communicating with and controlling connected accessories in a user’s home from the iPhone and Apple Watch. The point here is, when considering the overall ecosystem, the iPhone and the Apple Watch become control devices for both the television in the living room, as well as the lights in the living room and throughout the entire house, and the lock for the front door, the thermostat, the alarm system, etc. You said publicly that you enjoy using your Apple Watch as a remote control for your TV, and we look forward to joining you. But we also assume you will soon enjoy using your Apple Watch to control many more devices in your home. The recently released HealthKit platform represents another similarly large opportunity, and while the details of the business model are still unclear, just as they are for the home category, the degree to which both could impact their respective venues is immense. At a minimum, these new efforts in Health and Home will strengthen the Apple ecosystem and drive product sales of the Apple Watch and iPhone. Though it is likely Apple will monetize HomeKit and HealthKit in some way going forward, we have not included any revenues from these emerging platforms in our forecast for the next three years.
 
Apple Pay
As the home represents one compelling category for Apple, payments represents another. Apple Pay will launch in October 2014, and while we expect limited financial impact in FY 2015 as retailers upgrade their infrastructure to incorporate the requisite near-field communications technology (NFC), we expect a more meaningful contribution in FY 2016 that accelerates into FY 2017 and the following years. We estimate that, based upon Apple Pay’s rumored fee of 15 bps of all spend on credit and debit cards (U.S. card spend was $4.2 trillion in 2012) and merchant deployment of NFC reaching 80%+ in 2017, Apple in the U.S. could generate revenues (also equivalent to gross margins, as the variable costs are de minimis) of $2.5 billion in FY 2017 if it reaches 30% market share of all spend on U.S. credit and debit cards. The potential in the U.S. and internationally over a longer term is much larger. Apple, dominant in the premium market, has customers who spend more on average than its peers, and it is therefore unusually well positioned to succeed with Apple Pay where others could not.
 
Conclusion
To be totally clear, this letter is in no way intended as a criticism of you as CEO, nor is it intended to be critical of anything you or your team are doing from an operational perspective at Apple. Quite to the contrary, we could not be more supportive of you and your team, and of the excellent work being done at Apple, a company that continues to change the world through technological innovation. The intention of this letter is to communicate two things to you: (1) given the earnings growth we forecast for Apple, we continue to think that the market misunderstands and dramatically undervalues Apple and (2) the excess liquidity the company continues to hold on its balance sheet affords the company an amazing opportunity to take further advantage of this valuation disconnect by accelerating share repurchases. As mentioned before, we thank you and the Board for being receptive to us when we last communicated our perspective regarding the company’s valuation and requested more share repurchases. It is our understanding that you solicited feedback from various large shareholders concerning our previous request, but we don’t think anyone would deny that we were a key influence with respect to your previous decision to increase share repurchases. We thank you for being receptive to us and other large shareholders, all of whom are investment professionals offering advice concerning an investment decision, as the decision to repurchase shares is in effect the company making an investment in itself. And given the size of our investment and our proven track record with respect to public equity investing, we hope you will be receptive once again. Between January 1, 2000 through September 30, 2014, an investment in the stock of Icahn Enterprises L.P. (NASDAQ: IEP) had an annualized gross return of 21.5%. The Sargon Portfolio (a designated portfolio of assets co-managed by Brett Icahn and David Schechter within the private investment funds comprising Icahn Enterprises’ Investment segment, subject to the supervision and control of Carl Icahn) has generated annualized gross returns of 36.5% since its formation on April 1, 2010 through September 30, 2014 with $6.6 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2014. We believe this performance speaks for itself with respect to our expertise. At today’s price, Apple is one of the best investments we have ever seen from a risk reward perspective, and the size of our position is a testament to this. This investment represents the largest position in our investment history, reflecting the strength of the convictions we have expressed in this letter. While we recognize and applaud the company’s previously increased share repurchase authorization, we ask you to consider our advice once again (to the benefit of all shareholders) and consider accelerating share repurchases again via a tender offer. Our valuation analysis tells us that Apple should trade at $203 per share today, and we believe the disconnect between that price and today’s price reflects an undervaluation anomaly that will soon disappear. Mutual funds today face fierce competition with index funds that simply match the S&P500 index (in which Apple has a weight of 3.4%). Surprisingly, many mutual funds are underweight Apple, meaning that Apple represents less than 3.4% of their overall portfolio. This also means they are more likely to underperform the index if Apple outperforms, which is obviously an eventuality that should concern them. With more and more funds flowing from mutual funds to index funds (because mutual funds have consistently failed to outperform) the last thing they will want to see is their underperformance exacerbated by remaining underweight Apple as it continues to outperform. As the strength of the earnings growth we forecast materializes, and these funds scramble to correct this mistake, only to find themselves competing in the market to do so, a de facto short squeeze may occur, and we can only hope that the company has repurchased all the shares it can before that happens.

The financial situation of Uttar Pradesh-based Mawana Sugars and Modi Sugar Mills, which together owe Rs.837 crore dues to sugarcane farmers, is bad and they may not be able to clear the arrears by even selling their assets, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said on Thursday.
“Mawana and Modi have already approached the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), and they will find it hard to clear the cane arrears,” ISMA Director-General Avinash Verma told PTI.
“Even if they sell their assets, they will not be able to clear the entire dues to sugarcane growers,” he said.
Simbhaoli Sugar Mills, which owes about Rs.225 crore, is also finding tough to arrange funds to clear the cane arrears but the company has not yet approached BIFR, he added.
Stating that cane arrears in Uttar Pradesh are being cleared fast, Mr. Verma said total dues had come down to below Rs.3,000 crore so far.

Operations at the weaving machinery division of Lakshmi Automatic Loom Works in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, have been suspended in view of lack of orders for the “high speed’ ‘C’ type automatic shuttle weaving machines.”
The market for the machines has been hit, except for sporadic enquires for weaving specialised fabrics, due to the continuous import of both used and new shuttleless weaving machines, the company said in a filing to the BSE on Thursday.
The operations, suspended with immediate effect, were expected to remain so pending “finalisation of discussions with prospective foreign collaborators for manufacture of shuttleless weaving machines,” the company said.
The company, is part of the Lakshmi Mills group, and manufactures weaving and circular knitting machinery.
The company said operations continue at its Unit-2 in Kinathukadavu, near Pollachi.

Are you about to be sackedThese are topics LinkedIn Influencers weighed in on this week. Here’s what two of them had to say.
Robin Brodrick, senior HR operations coordinator at EMC and career coach at Talent Counseling
There are several tell-tale indications that you’re about to be sacked, wrote Brodrick in her post Four Signs You’re About to Get Fired and What to Do About It .
 “You find your job advertised online; your boss asks you to write standard operating procedures for everything to do; your day-to-day tasks slowly start getting reassigned to other people (or you’re asked to train others on how to do them ‘just in case’); you’re not being invited to meetings that you used to be included in,” she wrote.
Any of these sound familiar? Don’t panic. There are ways to figure out what’s really going on, Brodrick wrote.
“Schedule time on your boss’s calendar to speak with him or her,” wrote Brodrick, but don’t give them the topic ahead of time. “You don’t want to give your boss time to prepare for this conversation. You’re more likely to receive candid answers this way.”
Once you’ve got the meeting set, be prepared for some tough answers, Brodrick wrote.
Start the meeting simply: tell your boss you’re “seeing signs that people typically associate with getting fired and that you would like your boss to clarify the situation for you,” she wrote. “Now be quiet. Let silence be your weapon... just sit there and wait for their response.”
You’re likely to receive one of three responses, wrote Brodrick. The worst, of course, would be confirmation that you will be sacked. But, you might receive a good-news response — that the department is bulking up or putting new people in the pipeline in order to promote you, she wrote.
The third possibility, wrote Brodrick: “The company is advertising because they hear that you are looking for employment elsewhere, or because they feel like your workload is too much for one person and they want to add another member to the team.” If that’s the response, gauge whether the boss is telling the truth — and inquire more deeply about your responsibilities moving forward.
“No matter what your boss’s answer is, take the time to think before you reply,” Brodrick wrote.
Liz Ryan, chief executive officer and founder at Human Workplace
There are career blunders — and then there are near-fatal career blunders, wrote Ryan in her post The Five Deadliest Career Mistakes . The worst missteps can haunt you, or make it hard to push forward in your profession.
“Leaping without looking is the first deadly career mistake,” wrote Ryan. “Many talented and marketable people take the first job offer they get. They figure ‘any job is better than no job’ and undervalue themselves dramatically in the process.”
It makes sense, in some ways, explained Ryan. “On the one hand, they have an unexciting job offer. If they take it, they don't have to go on any more interviews, or worry about how to pay the rent,” she wrote. “If they pass on the offer, they remain open to everything the world might have in store for them, but they stay in Indecision Land a little longer. Most of us settle very quickly for a steady state over a state of flux, even when it hurts us to do so.”
The second deadly career mistake? Letting someone else run your career, wrote Ryan. This can easily happen when you’re in a company you like, but the milestones set for you don’t make sense or seem to be one more thing to do before the reward you already feel you’ve earned.
“An employer's plan for you, no matter how well-intended, is built with the employer's requirements in mind, not yours,” wrote Ryan. “If you're spending your energy hitting somebody else's yardsticks, you can easily lose track of your own path.”
The “third deadly career mistake is to burn bridges,” wrote Ryan. “When you get so fed up with a job that you have to leave, then go.”
And remember, you might not be so innocent. “You participated in creating the negative energy that you desperately want to escape right now. You've got a responsibility to disentangle yourself from the mess in an adult way,” Ryan wrote. “Unless you're being abused or are in an unsafe situation at your job, give two weeks’ notice on your way out. Smile, say only positive things and keep breathing. If you make less than a gracious exit, you're squandering whatever value your soon-to-be-former-job could add to your resume, not to mention your reputation.”

BHEL bags Ennore supercritical power projectUpdated: October 10, 2014 02:42 IST
BHEL bags Ennore supercritical power project
Special Correspondent
power (infrastructure)
After a brief legal battle, the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) has awarded the Rs.7,800-crore contract for the 2x660-MW Ennore Supercritical Power Project to Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL).
The contract, which BHEL has won against international competitive bidding, is for setting up the coal-fired thermal power project in the Ennore SEZ on an engineering, procurement and construction basis.
A consortium, with Central Southern China Electric Power Design Institute as the lead partner, had challenged the Tangedco’s decision in the Madras High Court in July.
Consortium’s representation
“As per the court order, we considered the consortium’s representation and have given them proper reply. At the same time, we have also finalised the tender and awarded the contract to BHEL,” a senior Tangedco official said.
The deal is significant for two reasons. One is that the power-starved Tamil Nadu will have 1,320 MW in about four years. Already, the Tangedco has awarded the Rs.4,000-crore 1x 660-MW Ennore expansion thermal power project to Lanco Infratech. It is expected to be commissioned in 2016.
These are the major power projects conceived and implemented by the AIADMK government in the past three years. With the commissioning of both, the State will have 2,000 MW added to its grid.
More importantly, the award of such a huge contract shows the present government can take decisions on its own, despite the absence of Jayalalithaa, the guiding force of the AIADMK government so far.
The lowest bidder
Speaking on condition of anonymity, Tangedco officials say BHEL was the lowest bidder for the supercritical project, and the consortium was merely indulging in “mud-slinging” on the state company.

Rupee trims initial losses  still down by 8 paise vs USDRupee trims initial losses, still down by 8 paise vs USD
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Oct 10, 2014 11:30 AM IST
The rupee pared its early losses today, but was still down by 8 paise to 61.13 against the US currency, on sustained bouts of dollar demand from importers amid weak domestic equities and bullish greenback overseas.
The rupee resumed lower at 61.15 per dollar as against yesterday's closing level of 61.05 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex).
It slid further to 61.20 on heavy bouts of dollar demand before quoting at 61.13 per dollar at 1030 hours.
The domestic unit moved in a range of 61.11 and 61.20 per dollar during the late morning deals.
In the New York market, the US dollar traded higher against its major rivals in early trade after the overnight eye-catching plunge in German exports raised fears of a recession in Europe's largest economy.
Crude oil prices fell to a two-year low in early Asian trade as weak economic data from Germany underscored concerns over a global economic slowdown and its impact on energy demand.
Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex was trading lower by 264.41 points, or 0.99%, to 26,372.87 at 1030 hours.

Punjab National Bank (PNB) has revised interest rates on single term deposit of Rs.1 crore to Rs.10 crore.
It is a move aimed at encouraging more short term deposits, particularly from the corporate sector, sources in the bank said. As per the announcement, made on Friday, interest on such deposits for a maturity period of 7-14 days is being revised to 6 per cent from 4 per cent.
The change for other maturity buckets is as follows: 15-29 days – 6 per cent (4.50 per cent); 30-45 days – 6.25 per cent (6.50 per cent); 46-90 days – 7 per cent (7.25 per cent); and 271 days to less than one year – 8.50 per cent (8.75 per cent).
PNB, in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange, said the changes take effect from October 10. It is the third bank in recent weeks to revise the interest rates on deposits and follows State Bank of India and Vijaya Bank.

Sensex plunges 340 points on global cuesUpdated: October 10, 2014 23:56 IST
Stocks plunges 340 points, rupee loses 30 paise
Special Correspondent
Stock prices dipped and rupee moved down against the dollar on Friday on global cues as the world markets were down with growth concerns. Further, lack of funds inflow from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) precipitated the fall.
The rupee closed at 61.35 a dollar compared to its previous close of 61.05 on Thursday.
The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) 30-share sensitive index (Sensex) dipped by 339.90 points or 1.28 per cent to close at 26297.38. However, the better-than-expected financial results from the information technology major, Infosys lifted the markets from a low of 26261.61.
Among the broader indices BSE 100 lost 1.31 per cent, BSE 200 (1.32 per cent) and BSE 500 (1.31 per cent). The mid-cap and small-cap stocks also lost at 1.38 per cent and 1.12 per cent respectively.
IT stocks gain
Except information technology stocks which gained 2.29 per cent and technology stocks (1.17 per cent), all other sectoral indices ended in the red with metal losing the most at 4.11 per cent followed by auto (2.78 per cent), FMCG (2.56 per cent) and banks (1.80 per cent).
On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the 50-share Nifty closed at 7859.95 with a loss of 100.60 points or 1.26 per cent.
“Markets are certainly tired and the momentum is broken. Even the brilliant result from Infosys is not enough to keep the market going. We need more such results from different sectors to bring back momentum,” said Arun Kajriwal, a leading stock market analyst.
Trading holiday
“With Wednesday being a trading holiday, on account of elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, momentum will get broken mid-week,” said Mr. Kejriwal, adding, “the driver thereafter could be exit polls for these two states.”

$6 trillion at stake if the bull loses$6 trillion at stake if the bull loses

The past three weeks have turned into a violent tug of war between the bulls and the bears, and for now it looks like the bears have the edge.
Triple-digit moves in the Dow Jones industrials are commonplace — 10 since the the Dow closed at its record on Sept. 19, and six of those on the downside.
Suddenly, the bull market that seemed so healthy back in September looks like it could be in trouble.
Anyone with a deep sense of history probably isn’t surprised, because this is exactly the time of year when big sea changes sometimes happen in the stock market.
It was almost exactly seven years ago on Oct. 9, 2007 that the last bull market ended and started a 17-month-long walk to the slaughterhouse that erased $11.2 trillion in stock wealth. That painful slide helped set the stage for the current bull market.
But a much more positive turn of events took place 12 years ago on Oct. 9, 2002. It was that day that the stock market finally pulled out of a brutal bear market that had wiped out $8.5 trillion.
The recent rough patch has dropped the Dow 620 points, or 3.6% from its high could easily turn out to be a hiccup. It’s been three years since stocks suffered even a 10% pullback, or correction, and a lot of people think a moderate pullback could actually be healthy for the market longer term.
But bear markets never take out an ad to let you know when they’ve started. So it’s probably worth taking a look at what is at stake if this turns out to be something longer and more serious.
Wilshire Associate says this bull market created more than $16 trillion in stock profits since its low. And $6 trillion came since the last peak in 2007.
So a bear market that causes anywhere near as much damage in dollar terms as the last two times around would put U.S. stock investors right back to where they were at the top of the last bull market.
And that would be a tough pill for investors to swallow.

Unknown activist to Nobel Peace: Kailash Satyarthi s lifeKailash Satyarthi’s crusade to save childhood continues; 60 mn still need him
KumKum Dasgupta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 10, 2014
First Published: 14:50 IST(10/10/2014) | Last Updated: 11:49 IST(11/10/2014)
Before he became the second Indian to win the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, not many had heard Kailash Satyarthi’s name.
 
But within 90 minutes of the announcement, the child's rights activist had gained more than 4,500 followers on Twitter--and the list was growing at blazing speed.
 
The 60-year-old activist has been a relentless crusader of child rights and his organisation, the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), has been at the forefront of the drive against child labour in India for years.
Interview: 'The award will benefit the movement'
 
“It was a passion from my childhood to work for children, I carried it forward," said Satyarthi. “I have been very strongly advocating that poverty must not be used as an excuse to continue child labour. It perpetuates poverty. If children are deprived of education, they remain poor.”

Satyarthi was trained as an electrical engineer, but he began his work by staging raids on Indian manufacturing, rug-making and other plants where children and their parents often work as bonded labour.
Read:  The highest honour: India’s Nobel Prize connection
 
The Bachpan Bachao Andolan, founded in 1980, has fought child labour by creating domestic and international consumer resistance to products made by bonded children, as well as with direct legal and advocacy work.
 
Building on his initial activism, Satyarthi organised the Global March Against Child Labor in the 1990s -- dedicated to freeing the millions of children abused worldwide in a form of modern slavery.
 
The activist is also founder of RugMark, a widely known international scheme that tags all carpets made in factories that are child-labour free.
Read: Why Kailash Satyarthi deserves the Nobel Peace Prize
 
In 1998, he organised the Global March Against Child Labour across 103 countries, which helped pave the way for an International Labor Organization convention on the worst forms of child labour.
 
He described the plight of children forced into the worst kinds of abusive work in a 2010 interview with the Robert F. Kennedy Centre for Justice and Human Rights.
 
"If they cry for their parents, they are beaten severely, sometimes hanged upside down from trees and even branded or burned with cigarettes," he said.
 
Satyarthi has said his social conscience was awoken when he was six and noticed a boy his age on the steps outside the school with his father, cleaning shoes.
Watch: 'Why I took up the cause of child rights'
Seeing many such children working instead of being educated, he felt an urge as he grew older to solve the problem -- launching him on his career of activism.
 
"I think of it all as a test. This is a moral examination that one has to pass. ... to stand up against such social evils," he said in the Kennedy Centre interview.
 
Through a number of training programmes, Satyarthi also helps children sold to pay off their parents' debts find new lives and serve as agents of prevention within their communities.
 
“The outstanding work that Mr Satyarthi has done over the past 35 years on child labour and trafficking has helped change mindsets and influence communities to protect children’s rights and create a more just society,” Deval Sanghavi, founder of Mumbai-based philanthropic organisation Dasra, told HT.
President Barack Obama on Friday congratulated Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai calling their Nobel “a victory for all who strive to uphold the dignity of every human being”.
Himself a Nobel peace laureate from 2009, Obama also said that despite their difference background, they share an “unshakeable belief in the basic dignity of every girl and boy”.
Read: Satyarthi’s hometown erupts in joy
 
The Bachpan Bachao Andolan was initiated as a grassroot-level and direct-action-oriented people's movement in 1980 to eliminate exploitation of children, especially child labour and child trafficking. The campaign has over 80,000 individuals and 750 organisations as members, who advocate and act for the protection of child rights.
 
One of Satyarthi’s big achievements is the promotion of a consumer awareness campaign in Europe and the US aimed at dissuading consumers from buying carpets made by child labourers and simultaneously endorsing goods produced without exploiting children.
 
Satyarthi uses an array of techniques including lobbying with politicians and knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court, National Human Rights Commission and other judicial institutions for enforcement of child rights laws.

HC orders Chautala to go back to jail tomorrowINLD chief Chautala to go back to jail today
Soibam Rocky Singh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 10, 2014

The Delhi high court on Friday cut short INLD leader Om Prakash Chautala’s campaign for the Haryana election and ordered him back to the high-security Tihar jail, where he is serving a 10-year term in a teacher recruitment scandal.
The court asked the former Haryana chief minister to surrender by Saturday and was critical of him for violating bail conditions — granted on plea of ill-health — by campaigning extensively for the October 15 election.
“You (Chautala) cannot take the court for a ride and cannot be permitted to question the majesty, dignity and decorum of this court,” justice Siddharth Mridul said. The court had on a number of occasions extended the bail first granted in May 2013.
After Cong, BJP misusing CBI: Abhay Chautala
With three days to go for the voting, it remains to be seen if the order will have a bearing on the fortunes of the Indian National Lok Dal, eyeing a comeback in the northern state.
The party has been counting on Chautala, its senior-most leader, to take on an aggressive BJP and capitalise on the anti-incumbency faced by the ruling Congress.
But, Chautala in jail may also translate into sympathy votes for the INLD that has considerable influence over Jat voters, expected to influence the outcome in at least 25 of the 90 assembly seats.
 In fact, the INLD accused the BJP of misusing the CBI to keep Chautala away from people.
His battery of lawyers, led by Ram Jethmalani, tried to convince the court to allow the 79-year-old to stay out of jail till Monday. But the court refused relief. “Let him surrender tomorrow. Let’s not bargain over this,” it said.
In an earlier hearing, the court had set October 17 as the date for surrender. In a plea filed Thursday, the CBI said Chautala be asked to return to jail immediately as he was busy holding poll rallies in violation of bail conditions.
Chautala, his son Ajay and eight others were sentenced to 10-year jail term on January 2013 for illegally recruiting 3,206 junior teachers. The former CM has challenged the judgment in the high court and a verdict is awaited.
Earlier in the day, Chautala appeared before a special CBI judge in a 2006 disproportionate assets case, which will now come up for hearing on October 30.

Delhi-based NGO now centre of attention of global media13

New Delhi: Until this afternoon, L-6 Kalkaji was a nondescript building in a leafy south-east Delhi neighbourhood from where an NGO was being run.
As evening descended, the world knew that the building housed the office of Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi.
Excitement was palpable in and around the office of Bachpan Bachao Andolan after the news broke. The road leading to the office was chock-a-block with a multitude of OB vans leading to a traffic chaos in an otherwise quiet locality.

Inside the office, a board at the reception read, "BBA total children released - since 1980 - 83,525".
One was greeted by a congratulatory message -  "Kailash Sir, Nobel Peace Prize, congrats" scribbled on a white board even as the staff was finding it difficult to cope with an increasing number of queries and requests for 'bytes' by the national and foreign media.
Twenty-four-year-old Suman Kumar, who was rescued by Satyarthi's NGO when he was all of eight working as a domestic help in Bihar, was standing right at the entrance.
"I work as a graphic designer here and I am fully self -sufficient today, all thanks to his exemplary work. He is the reason I could reclaim my childhood," said Suman.
Sudeep, a family friend of Satyarthi, could be seen shouting to the assembled mediapersons not to "create chaos".
"It is just not possible to accommodate everyone's requests at this point of time, because the list is inordinately large," he said.
Inside a makeshift media centre, journalists were furiously typing away reports. Pradeep Kumar Dey, a member of the staff who joined two years ago, was gleaming with joy as he went about distributing sweets among the visitors. "We distributed 10-20 kilograms of laddoo today. I have no time to breathe but not everybody can claim to work under a Nobel awardee," he said.
But many in the neighbourhood could be heard wondering the reason behind all the hullabaloo. Rolling down the window of his car, Devinder Kumar was heard asking, "Kya hua hai idhar?( What has happened here?)."
"Aap nahin jante? Saab ko Nobel mila hain(You don't know? Sir has won the Nobel)," pat came the reply from a visibly proud Pradeep.

Cyclone Hudhud: Odisha government starts evacuation of people50
0
Bhubaneswar: With the cyclonic storm Hudhud intensifying into a very severe cyclonic storm, the Odisha government on Friday asked eight district collectors of south Odisha to start evacuation of the vulnerable population to safe buildings and cyclone centres.
The government has asked the collectors of Malkangiri, Koraput, Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Gajapati, Ganjam, Kalahandi and Kandhamal to carefully assess and evacuate the people likely to be affected by the cyclone.
The India Meteorology Department (IMD) has forecast that these districts will be affected by Hudhud although wind speed, after landfall of the system around Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh Oct 12, is likely to be reduced substantially.
For communication with the district administration during the cyclone, government has provided 14 satellite phones obtained from the union government.

The wind speed in south districts of Odisha is likely to be 80-90 kmph, said a spokesperson of Special Relief Commissioner here.
He added that free kitchens will be opened to provide hot meal at shelter places, besides drinking water.
IMD has forecast very heavy to extreme rainfall in south Odisha districts. Besides, other coastal districts may also get heavy rainfall.
Fifteen units of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and 10 teams of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) have been deployed in districts likely to be affected by the cyclone and associated flood. One NDRF team has been kept in reserve. Out of these, 4 units of NDRF have been diverted from the NDRF Battalion, Kolkata," said the spokesperson.
These teams will assist the district administration in carrying out search, rescue and evacuation operations. The Fire Service units will also be associated in the search, rescue and evacuation operations.
For communication with the district administration during the cyclone, government has provided 14 satellite phones obtained from the union government.
The rescue operation teams and government officials Friday conducted mock drill in all the 323 multi-purpose cyclone shelters in the state with active participation of the community.

Mitali Saran: Married to the mobMitali Saran: Media after Modi: Married to the mob
Mitali Saran |  Oct 10, 2014 09:47 PM IST
Never has the Indian media - at least the English-speaking media - managed to so spectacularly lose control of the national conversation.
With a few notable exceptions, many of them independent journalists, the media appears to have given up any pretence at directing news editing and trying to arrive as close to truth as possible. It is behaving, instead, like a school of herring, flashing from one point to another, changing direction in a split second - millions of individuals reacting like one single organism twitching in response to some stimulus. Narendra Modi in the United States? Swachh Bharat? Firing on the Line of Control? Journalists pounce on each either fawningly or defensively, and drop it as soon as the next thing comes up. There's insufficient insistence on an answer, on follow-up, or on contextualisation.
ALSO READ:  Rajdeep Sardesai expresses regret for scuffle in New York
The media has, in fact, allowed politics - in real life as much as on Twitter - to tame and control its journalistic instincts. Its engagement increasingly reflects, or allows people to assume it reflects, the political polarisation of the electorate - for the Bharatiya Janata Party, or for the Congress. It's stupid, it's dangerous, and speaking of patriotism, it does nothing for the country.
The greatest casualty of the 2014 elections has been nuance, the death of which was long foretold by a cultural aversion to challenging authority without enmity, and, therefore, a long history of poor standards in critical thinking. The brightest students in the world tend to be Indian, and yet, paradoxically, amount to a country that holds rather dim conversations with itself.
2014 has left us a quiver of large, emotive words such as "patriotism", "culture", "society", "pride" and "hurt" - each invoked unexamined and undefined, as if they were words of last resort. The media keeps trying to prove its own credentials in the context of these terms, thereby merely getting jerked around in a conversation that is not of its making.
The Constitution is the best of all our books, holding within itself the possibility of all other books, including all the holy ones, and the ones we keep trying to ban. It holds within itself the possibility of all religions and all cultural practices and individual rights, and the possibility of adjudicating any clashes between those three things. It even holds within itself the possibility of constructive amendment of itself. It is an inclusive, generous, pluralistic, secular document that already holds many, if not all, the answers to our dilemmas. It is the lodestone to which we should be returning again and again, not merely in the courts, but in our own individual thinking and private and public discussions.
Nowhere in that document does it say that India is a Hindu country. Nowhere does it imply that criticism of an individual or official or government amounts to offence or lack of patriotism; nowhere does it suggest that you should be arrested for an act in the nature of a Facebook "like" or for not standing up for the national anthem. Freedom of expression continues to be protected. An official can either "swear in the name of God" or give god the go-by and simply "solemnly affirm".
Patriotism is an allegiance to the vision set down in the Constitution. It is that document, and that vision, to which elected leaders swear allegiance when they take office. If anything should be a clinching argument, the Constitution should be. Nationalism is the fairground mirror version of patriotism - an extreme, distorted, grotesque thing that bears little resemblance to the original.
The prime minister's strategy is to direct the conversation - or, as we've seen in his entirely complicit silence in the face of an emboldened, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-led or RSS-backed Hindu right taking over educational policy and institutions with a view to stamping out secular pluralism - to allow the amplification of a certain kind of ugly, untruthful, divisive conversation. But if he's going to do that, he should be doing it on his own, via state-controlled radio and television broadcasts. The free press oxygenates conversations, and there is plenty of scope in the free press to remind him of the oath he swore to "bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established", and to remind the nasty fringe elements, all loudly self-professed patriots, of what is in that document.
We should be holding governments to the oaths they swear. Why are we allowing an informal socio-cultural grey market to determine the agenda and make the conversation about small squabbles located in flawed or irrelevant principles? The media needs to return to its basic functions: keep a critical eye on all, give credit where credit is due, and measure governments against their constitutional duties not against political affiliation or a zero-to-10 charisma chart.

Worst NPA trouble behind us: Rakesh SharmaWorst NPA trouble behind us: Rakesh Sharma
Somasroy Chakraborty | Kolkata Oct 10, 2014 11:45 PM IST
Rakesh Sharma joined Lakshmi Vilas Bank as managing director and CEO in March 2014. Prior to this assignment, he was State Bank of India (SBI)’s chief general manager for Patna circle. In an interview with Somasroy Chakraborty, Sharma says the old-generation private sector bank is confident of trimming its bad assets in the coming quarters, despite the uncertain macro-economic environment. Edited excerpts:
Are you worried about the deteriorating health of bank credit?
There is pressure on credit quality. But we have tightened our loan sanction process, strengthened credit monitoring system and stepped up recovery efforts. These initiatives have helped reduce our bad loans. Our gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio was at 3.96 per  cent at the end of June, compared to 4.19 per cent in March and 5.60 per cent in December.
I believe we have seen the worst in terms of asset quality deterioration and now it is behind us. We are hopeful that we will be able to improve our credit quality further and reduce the gross NPA ratio below three per cent by the end of this financial year.
What is making you optimistic?
We have strengthened our systems and processes. I’m personally monitoring the recovery efforts in some of the stressed accounts. We are now shifting our focus to retail and SME (small and medium enterprise) segments. Also, as the economy improves the stress in the system will reduce.
The credit demand has remained largely muted. What are your growth expectations for 2014-15?
We expect 20 per cent growth in our advances on a year-on-year basis. But this is mainly because our base was small. In the first six months of this financial year,  the growth has been slow. With the festive season beginning, we are hoping for some improvement in demand. There are a few good proposals that we are currently evaluating, which will help us grow our loan portfolio.
With deposit rates staying high, do you expect pressure on your net interest margin in the coming quarters?
Our net interest margin was at 2.5 per cent at the end of the first quarter, compared to 2.87 per cent at the end of March 2014.
We are aiming to improve it to 3 per cent by the end of this financial year, by increasing the share of low-cost CASA (current account savings account) deposits in our total deposits.
We are looking to expand our CASA ratio to 16.5 per cent from 14.22 per cent. We have started offering higher interest rate for savings deposits over Rs 1 lakh.
Also, we have restructured some of our term deposit rates in September after evaluating our asset-liability position.
The bank’s capital adequacy ratio was 10.9 per cent under Basel-III norms at the end of March 2014. How much has been the improvement in your capital adequacy ratio following the rights issue? Are you planning to raise more money in the near-term to strengthen capital base further?
We raised Rs 406 crore through rights issue, which has improved our capital adequacy ratio to 14.6 per cent. At this moment, we have sufficient capital to finance our business growth.
Hence, we have no immediate plan to raise capital in the near term.

Anderson dismisses KPs bullying culture claimsUpdated: October 10, 2014 18:18 IST
Anderson dismisses KP’s bullying culture claims

TOPICS
cricket
England pace spearhead James Anderson has dismissed claims made by Kevin Pietersen in his autobiography that a bullying culture flourished in the team in the recent years and described the developments in the last few days as “sad”.
The release of ‘KP: The Autobiography’ this week has been accompanied by controversy with former players either backing or criticising the controversial former batsman.
Anderson said the England team will not let Pietersen’s claims distract them when they take on the field against Sri Lanka next month.
“We’ve got cricket to play -- more important things to worry about than someone’s book,” he said at an event at the Lord’s last night.
“The issues that have been brought up are sad really -- the dressing room for the last seven or eight years when we’ve been winning has been amazing,” said Anderson.
Anderson was one of the players Pietersen blames in his autobiography, which was published yesterday, for creating a bowling clique within the team.
“You don’t achieve what we have without guys pulling in the same direction. I can’t get my head round it, he seems like he’s just not enjoyed it for however long,” Anderson said.
“This is not an ideal situation but it’s different with Kev. He never got a chance to stand up for himself in the dressing room because the opportunity to be in the dressing room was taken away from him by the powers that be. He is now venting his frustration through a book. You never get a team where everyone gets on together.”
Asked if Pietersen’s accusations of bullying were true, Anderson said, “Not at all.”
Anderson was speaking alongside Pietersen’s former team-mates Matthew Hoggard, Paul Collingwood and Simon Jones.
Pacer Jones, who was part of 2005 Ashes-winning team, had some words of support for Pietersen.
“For Kev to come out and say the things he has there must be some truth behind it. We will see what happens over the next couple of weeks. I am sure Matty Prior will come back at him. But I think at the moment, Kev is the happiest man in the world because he’s selling books, the press have done him a massive favour and Twitter has gone bonkers and he’s a happy man,” Jones said.
However, there was little sympathy for Pietersen from fellow 2005 Ashes-winner Matthew Hoggard, who described his former team-mate as being “very bitter”.
“I think he is getting a lot of his anger out and it’s fantastic way of selling books before Christmas. In relation to the Twitter account that was not investigated properly but everything else I think he’s brought on himself and he’s just being a kiddy in a school ground.”
Paul Collingwood, about whom Pietersen talks fondly in his book, was also fairly unsympathetic.
“I don’t really understand all of this to be honest. The last seven years has been fantastic for English cricket. KP has done a lot for English cricket but also English cricket has done a lot for KP. This is one man’s opinion against everyone else’s.”

RIL could report flat profit  petchem business to perform wellRIL could report flat profit, petchem business to perform well
Kalpana Pathak | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 12:18 AM IST
Mukesh Ambani
Reliance Industries’ earnings for the second quarter will mirror the fall in crude oil prices and appreciation in the rupee.
India’s largest private sector company might see its July-September quarter’s profit flat — between Rs 5,600 crore and Rs 5,670 crore — quarter-on- quarter and up two to three per cent year-on-year. During the second quarter of 2013-14, RIL had Rs 5,490 crore as net profit.
Gross refining margins (GRMs) — the realisation from turning every barrel of crude into finished products — would see a marginal drop. RIL’s GRMs are expected to decline in line with the benchmarks, driven by lower middle-distillate cracks. “We estimate the company’s GRMs to average at $7.7 per barrel, from $8.7 per barrel in the first quarter,” said ICICI Securities (ISec). It said it expected refining Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) to decline 25 per cent on a quarterly basis.
GRMs for the Singapore Complex dropped by $1 a barrel on a quarterly basis to $4.8 a barrel. The crack spreads for RIL’s key products fell — diesel by $1.8 a barrel and naphtha mildly by $0.5 a barrel.
IIFL said the refining margins had declined on a sequential basis, on the back of a fall in gasoil and jet kero spreads. RIL, having a high proportion of these fuels in its product slate, will bear the brunt.
During the quarter, Brent crude oil was down seven per cent. On a yearly basis, it declined 7.3 per cent. The rupee depreciated 1.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter and rose 2.3 per cent over a year. On exploration and production (E&P), analysts said RIL could see a moderate decline in crude oil production from the MA·1 field and gas production from the KG-D6 field.
However, strong performance in petrochemicals will help the company offset the lower GRMs and weak performance on E&P. ISec added it expected other income to be higher by six per cent on a quarterly basis, at Rs 2,100 crore.
“Petrochemicals is likely to be a stellar quarter,” said Morgan Stanley, adding it saw overall Ebit from petrochemicals rising 32 per cent quarter on quarter to Rs 25,000 crore, though flat on a yearly basis. Higher polymer and polyester spreads will contribute.
Oil marketing companies are expected to post a decent set of numbers, on the back of full provisioning of subsidy sharing from the government. Lower interest costs will help the three companies — Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum — post profits during the quarter.

Apollo White to open six dental spas by March 2015Apollo White to open six dental spas by March 2015
BS Reporter | Pune Oct 10, 2014 08:58 PM IST
Apollo White Dental is planning to open six dental spas along with 100 dental care centres in India by end of March 2015. The company is a 70:30  joint venture between Apollo Hospitals Enterprise and medical technology company Trivitron Healthcare. It has opened its sixth and first dental spa in Pune which offers seven star treatment to its patients.
“We are planning to open six spas and expand to 100 clinics in different formats. The total investment for this expansion would be Rs  100 crore. The spa accommodates staff of 20 people including 8 to 10 dental surgeons. These spas are owned by the company and requires an investment of Rs  3.5 crore each. We are  planning to open six more spas by end of March 2015”, says V S Venkatsh, CEO, Apollo White Dental.
According Venkatsh , the company has a growth rate of 100 per cent on y-o-y basis and registered a revenue of Rs  32 crore in the last financial year. As per the company announcement, it is expected to expand from the current 30 clinics to 100 clinics in different formats across the country in the next two years.  It would set up around six spas, 10-15 studios and 40-50 clinics across India. The JV has so far invested around Rs  30 crore in its operations. the average break-even period for a White centre will be six months.
Recently, Apollo Dental Centre has been rebranded as White dental clinics.  The company has launched four formats with a different pricing strategy, including Dental Spa as a super-specialty luxury brand, Dental Studio as the second line after the spa, Dental Clinics as neighbourhood clinics and Dental Express, which would mainly address the beauty aspects of dental care, with instant smile enhancement and teeth-whitening procedures in airports, malls and Apollo hospitals.

Direct Jet Airways flight from A bad to Abu Dhabi from Nov 14Direct Jet Airways flight from A'bad to Abu Dhabi from Nov 14
BS Reporter |  Oct 10, 2014 08:57 PM IST
Following a high level delegation of Union Civil Aviation Ministry meeting with Saurabh Patel, civil aviation minister, Government of Gujarat last month, Jet Airways is now set to start direct flight from Ahmedabad to Abu Dhabi from November 14, 2014.
Apparently, in the meeting with the delegation, Patel has emphasised on better air connectivity for people of Gujarat, thereby resulting in Jet Airways announcing the direct flight.
The flight will depart from Sardar Patel International Airport at Ahmedabad at around 1500 hrs and would take three hours to reach Abu Dhabi. Air India has already promised to add a new flight in their winter schedule to New Delhi.

LNG may help keep power tariff lowLNG may help keep power tariff low
BS Reporter | Kochi Oct 10, 2014 08:38 PM IST
The price of LNG has a direct relation with the crude oil prices. "The use of LNG in the power sector has helped the nation keep the power tariff low," said A K Balyan, managing director of Petronet LNG. He added that hence there had been no substantial hike in the power tariff for the last 14 years.
He also said that the Kerala government must take initiatives in laying pipelines to northern Kerala. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka too can benefit from the Kochi terminal if the pipelines are laid.
Balyan said, "Kerala was lucky to get an LNG terminal as other south Indian states were not having any access to this green fuel." He added, the laying of pipelines is crucial to the marketing and distribution of gas.
But India was far behind the developed countries as far as pipelines is concerned. He said that the USA has a pipeline network of about 2.5 million kms while India's pipeline is only 14,000 kms. The country has spent Rs 4,600 crore for the Puthuvype gas terminal. But its capacity utilisation is barely 1 per cent.
Paul Antony, Chairman, Cochin Port Trust (CPT) today said that the laying of pipelines in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is of paramount importance for the successful utilisation of the LNG terminal, at Puthuvype, near here.
Speaking at the three-day workshop on the use of LNG, organised at FACT Ambalamedu House, he said that the gas pipelines could not be laid in the northern districts of Kerala due to stiff resistance from the people in the area.
Pipeline laying in Ernakulam district has already been completed. This is less than 10 per cent of the total network, connecting three south Indian states. He said, people's mentality has to change to benefit from a massive investment of Rs 4,600 crore spent on the Puthuvype LNG terminal.
He also favoured a uniform pricing policy for natural gas. He suggested that in order to avoid the high disparity in the price of LNG in northern India and Kerala, there could be a pooling of gas pricing so that all the users would get it at a uniform price.
Jaiveer Srivastava, chairman and managing director of FACT, said, though FACT was looking forward to the successful use of LNG at their ammonia plant, the exorbitant price of LNG has forced the company to suspend the use of gas in January 2014.
He said that there would be a favourable trend on the pricing front soon so that gas would be available to FACT at an affordable rate.
He also expressed confidence that people would soon become more aware of the importance of LNG and they would demand gas connectivity to their region. "City gas will be a blessing for domestic consumers which will be safer and cheaper than LPG," he said. He also favoured a uniform pricing of gas through a pooling system.
Balyan also informed that talks with the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) are at an advanced stage for use of LNG in the corporation buses. Hindustan Life Care has already started use of LNG in their Thiruvananthapuram unit.

Satyarthi makes online splash with Nobel winSatyarthi makes online splash with Nobel win
AFP  New Delhi, October 10, 2014
First Published: 18:24 IST(10/10/2014) | Last Updated: 21:01 IST(10/10/2014)

The Twitter following of India's Kailash Satyarthi began jumping exponentially and his website appeared to crash as he was catapulted into the global spotlight after winning the Nobel Peace Prize Friday.
Satyarthi, a low-profile child's rights activist, was a social media minnow before winning the prestigious prize, with fewer than 200 followers on Twitter.
But within 90 minutes of the announcement, he had gained more than 4,500 followers -- and the list was growing at blazing speed.
A Google search under his name prior to his Nobel victory yielded fewer than half a dozen pages of search results in English, indicating how little was known about the activist. But the pages were also multiplying exponentially after his win.
His personal website, www.kailashsatyarthi.net , which sports the blurb "Kailash Satyarthi... the seeker of truth", was failing to open -- apparently under the strain of heavy demand.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee recognised Satyarthi's contribution in heading various forms of protests and demonstrations, all peaceful, focusing on the grave exploitation of children for financial gain.
"Children must go to school and not be financially exploited," the committee said.
"In conflict-ridden areas in particular, the violation of children leads to the continuation of violence from generation to generation."

Hudhud turns into  very severe cyclonic storm   rescue teams on alert38 trains cancelled as cyclone Hudhud picks up momentum

Cyclone Hudhud was upgraded to a “very severe cyclonic storm” on Friday as it hurtled towards India’s east coast, where it is expected to make landfall near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh by Sunday noon.

The governments in Andhra and Odisha, which also lies in the storm’s path, will start massive evacuations on Saturday and has put the local administration on high alert. In Visakhapatnam alone, about 35,000 people need to be evacuated from 57 coastal villages and moved to 40 relief camps.
“The storm will gain in intensity and hit the coast at a speed of 140-150 kmph with wind speeds of up to 165kmph,” India Meteorological Department director general Dr LS Rathore said.
Rising waters of the cyclone would inundate low lying areas of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts of Andhra, he added.
The gathering storm comes almost exactly one year after Phailin, also a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’, hit the Odisha coast, bringing gales of 200-220kmph that killed nearly 30 people and displaced more than 400,000.
“We are expecting Hudhud’s intensity to decrease 12 hours after hitting the coast,” Rathore said, forecasting rain in parts of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. There will be no impact on the climate in Delhi, he added.
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has dispatched 39 teams — 1,573 personnel and 193 boats — to vulnerable places in the two states. “The Centre is closely monitoring Hudhud’s progression,” said home minister Rajnath Singh, after speaking to the chief ministers of Odisha, Andhra and Telangana.

Schools and colleges in Visakhapatnam will be closed on Saturday. Fishing operations have been suspended in six districts of Andhra and four in Odisha.
“If people don’t leave even after the warnings, police will be used to evacuate them,” said Visakhapatnam district magistrate N Yuvaraj.
The armed forces are also on alert with four warships of the Eastern Naval Command and six naval aircraft on standby for rescue operations and airdropping of relief material. The Coast Guard has deployed 17 ships and nine aircraft.
The cyclone is also set to hit railway services with 38 trains cancelled and 31 diverted. Flight operations at Visakhapatnam airport would also be affected.
In Odisha, officials said heavy rainfall was expected in eight districts for the next two days. Rescue personnel have started mock drills in at least 323 multi-purpose cyclone shelters. “If necessary, people in the eight districts will be evacuated to cyclone shelters,” Odisha special relief commissioner PK Mohapatra said.
The scare is evident in Odisha’s Ganjam district, badly hit by Phailin. At Gopalpur, where Phailin made landfall, the beaches looked deserted on Friday. “At least 80% tourists have cancelled their bookings,” said a hotel owner.

Sharad Pawar says Modi is misleading peopleSharad Pawar says Modi is misleading people
Sanjay Jog | Mumbai Oct 10, 2014 11:06 PM IST
Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and his nephew and former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday hit back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his remarks about them made on Thursday.
On Thursday, while addressing a poll rally at Baramati, which is the Pawars’ traditional bastion, Modi had remarked that the Maharashtra Assembly polls this year were a “second freedom struggle” — “for independence from the uncle and nephew. Baramati was to be made slavery-free.”
In a speech at a party function on Friday, Ajit challenged Modi to prove whether there was any slavery in Baramati.
Besides, both, Sharad and Ajit Pawar also contested Modi’s allegation that the elder Pawar had done nothing during his stint as Union defence minister between 1991-1993, when P V Narasimha Rao was the prime minister.
Speaking exclusively to Business Standard,  the NCP chief said national security had been his priority during his tenure and there had been no attack from China or Pakistan on India’s borders in those two years.
Ajit said his uncle had travelled extensively across the country and also visited the Siachen glacier during his tenure as defence minister.
On the issue of water supply schemes for 40 villages in Baramati raised by Modi, the Pawar duo said the prime minister should worry about the drinking water problem in Kutch and other drought-prone regions of Gujarat.
Sharad Pawar told Business Standard that a water supply scheme for 40 villages has been cleared and it would be undertaken soon. He dared Modi to release the list of villages in Gujarat reeling under water shortages.
On Modi’s charge against Pawar that he had created confusion on the issue of quota for the Dhangar (shepherd) community, the NCP chief said he had taken the lead and about seven to eight meetings were held for the resolution of the issue. Pawar charged that Modi was misleading people.

DGCA grounds three aircraft for safety violationsDGCA grounds three aircraft for safety violations
BS Reporter |  Oct 11, 2014 12:31 AM IST
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has grounded three aircraft of Air India, GoAir and a non-scheduled operator (NSOP) over alleged safety lapses.
A source in the DGCA informed three aircraft, including two Airbus A-320s and a Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ), had been grounded.
An Airbus A-320 of Air India was grounded as the carrier had not done a mandatory second check of the cowl or covering of the right-side engine, repaired several weeks ago for a dent. The carpets in the interior were found torn and could affect movement of passengers, specially in an emergency.
The second Airbus A-320 of GoAir was grounded after it was found a number of screws and bolts of its right-side air-conditioning panel were loose and not properly fixed. This could have caused an in-flight safety problem. The door seal of the aircraft’s nose-gear was found not properly sealed. The aircraft manual, a mandatory document for pilots, was also not updated. An 18-seater CRJ of A R Airways was grounded as the life-raft container panel was found jammed. Two cabin crew members did not have proper training, it was found.
A senior official in DGCA said these aircraft would be released only after their owners rectified the defects found. The two airlines and the private operator have also been asked to explain how such defects were not rectified.
In the first half of the current calendar year, the DGCA conducted 55 special surveillance drives that led to the grounding of 14 aircraft during the period.

US Trade Representative says India  reneged  WTO TFAUS Trade Representative says India 'reneged' WTO TFA
Nayanima Basu | New Delhi Oct 11, 2014 12:14 AM IST
Keeping the pressure on the Government of India to sign the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), US Trade Representative Michael Froman blamed India for going back on a promise to do so, while urging it should be implemented “immediately.”
“Unfortunately, a handful of countries led by India reneged on the commitment they made in Bali just last December and blocked implementation of the agreement. It should be implemented immediately, not only because of its direct economic importance but also to give new life to the multilateral trading system,” Froman said in an Opinion piece in British daily Financial Times.
The US and European Union, plus some other countries, had been vocally critical on the GOI's stance during the General Council meeting at WTO headquarters in Geneva this July. The issue was also raised by US President Barack Obama during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington last month. The PM had told him India was not opposed to the TFA, which seeks to ease global Customs barriers. However, it wants other countries to first agree on a consensus for its food security concerns.
According to the joint statement issued after the meeting, both leaders directed their officials “to consult urgently along with other WTO members on the next steps”. The US is keeping up the pressure on India. The matter also came up during a meeting recently between deputy USTR Wendy Cutler and commerce secretary Rajeev Kher.
Back in Geneva, during the Preparatory Committee on Trade Facilitation on September 29, US ambassador Michael Punke had asked for discontinuation of the committee as it believes all work on the TF is over and there is no reason why it should meet. The US said it believed further work on addressing this issue should take place within the General Council and not in the PCTF, which had completed its work.
India, on the other hand, said more discussion needed to take place on TFA, even as it stayed firm on its position, which is to have a permanent solution to its concerns on public stockholding for food security.

Kenneth Rogoff: China s inscrutable contractionKenneth Rogoff: China's inscrutable contraction
Kenneth Rogoff |  Oct 10, 2014 09:49 PM IST
While virtually every country in the world is trying to boost growth, China's government is trying to slow it down to a sustainable level. As China shifts to a more domestic-demand driven, services-oriented economy, a transition to slower trend growth is both inevitable and desirable. But the challenges are immense, and no one should take a soft landing for granted.
As China's economy grows relative to the economies of its trading partners, the efficacy of its export-led growth model must inevitably fade. As a corollary, the returns on massive infrastructure investment, much of which is directed toward supporting export growth, must also fade.
Consumption and quality of life need to rise, even as China's air pollution and water shortages become more acute in many areas. But in an economy where debt has exploded to more than 200 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), it is not easy to rein in growth gradually without triggering widespread failure of ambitious investment projects. Even in China, where the government has deep pockets to cushion the fall, one Lehman Brothers-size bankruptcy could lead to a major panic.
Think of how hard it is to engineer a soft landing in market-based economies. Many a recession has been catalysed or amplified by monetary-tightening cycles; former United States Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was christened the "maestro" in the 1990s, because he managed to slow inflation and maintain strong growth simultaneously. The idea that controlled tightening is easier in a more centrally planned economy, where policy makers must rely on far noisier market signals, is highly questionable.
If one were to judge by official and market growth forecasts, one would think that the risks were modest. China's official target growth rate is 7.5 per cent. Anyone forecasting seven per cent is considered a "China bear", and predicting a downshift to 6.5 per cent makes one a downright fanatic.
For most countries, such small differences would be splitting hairs. In the United States, quarterly GDP growth has fluctuated between -2.1 per cent and 4.6 per cent in the first half of 2014. Of course, Chinese growth almost surely fluctuates far more than the official numbers reveal, in part because local officials have incentives to smooth the data that they report to the central authorities.
So where is China's economy now? Most evidence suggests that the economy has slowed significantly. One striking fact is that annual growth in electricity demand has fallen sharply, to below four per cent for the first eight months of 2014, a level recorded previously only in the depths of the global financial crisis that erupted in 2008. For most of China's modernisation drive, electricity consumption has grown faster than output, not slower.
Weakening electricity demand has tipped China's coal industry into severe distress, with many mines effectively bankrupt. Falling house prices are another classic indicator of a vulnerable economy, though the exact pace of decline is difficult to assess. The main house-price indices measure only asking prices and not actual sales prices. (Data in many other countries - for example, Spain - suffer from the same deficiency.)
Of course, exports have also slowed, given sluggish growth in the rest of the world. Commodity exporters, such as Australia, Indonesia and Brazil, have already felt the effects of slowing Chinese growth, as have countries, such as Germany and Switzerland, that depend on satisfying China's voracious demand for capital-intensive goods.
Unfortunately, China's data are not nearly as reliable as those measuring a developed economy, which makes it difficult for anyone to be sure of what is happening. Electricity use is typically one of the most reliable measures of growth; but with the economy shifting toward services, and with many energy-intensive industries, such as cement and steel production, slowing down, it is perfectly possible that slow electricity growth is simply a symptom of rebalancing.
Likewise, the softening of housing prices follows a short period in which prices more than doubled, which makes it difficult to tell whether China is facing a modest and healthy correction or outright collapse. And if continental Europe eventually recovers, as the United States and the United Kingdom are, export growth could pick up again.
What seems clear is that China's leadership is intent on pursuing many of the market-oriented reforms approved by the Third Plenary in 2013. President Xi Jinping's aggressive anti-corruption campaign might be seen as preparation for political resistance to further economic liberalisation. On the other hand, one can argue that, until now, Chinese corruption was more of a tax than a paralysing force, and that dramatically changing the rules of the game could by itself catalyse a sharp drop in output.
Can China's government engineer a soft landing while weeding out corruption, reducing pollution, and liberalising markets to ensure long-term growth? The stakes are high. If Chinese growth collapses, the global fallout could be far worse than that caused by a normal United States recession.
China's growth rate remains perched at a very high level, so there is a great deal of room to fall. The potential vulnerability of Western exports and equity prices is massive. Of the two major instances of policy tightening occurring in the world today, the United States Fed's may be the easier one to understand, but it is not necessarily more consequential for the world than what is happening in China.

Sunil Sethi: Narendra Modi s long honeymoonSunil Sethi: Narendra Modi's long honeymoon
Sunil Sethi |  Oct 10, 2014 09:48 PM IST
Any bridegroom who's had a long and ardent courtship followed by a thunderously successful marriage celebration knows how to extend the honeymoon for as long as possible. By that standard Narendra Modi belongs to the practiced charm school: he looks good and sounds convincing; he is ubiquitous to the point of being omnipresent; he adheres to touching religious traditions such as living on glasses of warm water during his roller-coaster ride in the United States; he's punctilious about picking up the broom himself to show how the household is to be kept sparkling clean. Above all, his treasure chest of bridal booty is boundless. Six months into the honeymoon, and the promise of gifts keep coming …
The figures are impressive and the deadline targets ambitious: bank accounts for 75 million households to be opened by January 26, 2015, under the Jan Dhan scheme; 111 million homes to be equipped with toilets by October 2, 2019, during the Swachh Bharat mission; and housing for all by 2022 announces Venkaiah Naidu, the prime minister's urban development and poverty alleviation minister. Even the MSGs (as Mr Modi's Madison Square Garden fans are called) had lollipops thrown at them during the euphoric spectacle in New York: life-long visas for Persons of Indian Origin status and visas on arrival for Americans. Sadly, the October 2 deadline for e-visas set by the government has already slipped; as for visas on arrival or life-time visas, given the number of government agencies involved, the ideas are nowhere near completion. There are neither necessary security mechanisms in place nor enough trained immigration staff to handle an onrush of arrivals at metropolitan airports.
Freedom from immigration barriers for overseas visitors, however, is a relatively small matter compared to the financial freedom and freedom from squalor being promised to the millions of unlettered and unwashed at home. The prime minister has a messiah's eye for the noble gesture and an impresario's sense of timing - announcing Jan Dhan on Independence Day, Swachh Bharat on Gandhi Jayanti - but less prophetic is how these promised schemes will be completed to the punishing deadlines.
Many of his Cabinet cohorts appeared with brooms for decorous photo-ops on October 2, evidently sweeping the dirt from one corner to another, but if they had dived into the nearest municipal toilet, or faced the mountains of uncleared garbage over the holiday weekend, the pictures would have been more accurate. One of the persisting problems with most urban municipalities is the hordes of unionised and unaccountable safai karamcharis. For example, rosters of the National Capital Region's three municipal corporations are stuffed with fake employees; in 2011 the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)'s office observed that the number of temporary employees in the department of environment and management services had swelled by 1,055 per cent -from 1,431 in 2006-07 to 16,525 in 2007-08. Biometric IDs to ensure attendance had not helped: one ID was allotted to 17 karamcharis. Wrong dates of birth, the CAG report added, resulted in "increased age of retirement of employees in a range of four months to 11 years".
In some urban districts, and even villages, enlightened residents have taken matters into their hands by evolving public-private partnerships in sanitation, garbage disposal and waste management. The practice could be made mandatory in alliances between citizens, non-governmental organisations and municipality employees. However, this would mean cutting the inflated workforce, including "ghost" retainers that swell the wage bill. At a micro-level, these on-ground decisions are hard for governments to countenance.
Raise the numbers to scale and other ghosts become visible. Nitin Gadkari's rural development ministry reckons that the target of 111 million toilets by 2019 can only be met if the government builds 50,000 every day. Finance ministry mandarins are similarly apprehensive about establishing 75 million Aadhaar-linked bank accounts in four months, given the stress faced by debt-laden public-sector banks, short on rural credit and infrastructure.
Several of these schemes - biometric IDs, rural toilets, visas on arrival - are carry-overs from the decade of Congress-led rule. Yet by the second term of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA II) they were an albatross round the government's neck for being shop-soiled and incompetent. Mr Modi has resonantly amplified these by spelling out targets, numbers and delivery deadlines. Poised to win state elections this month, with assurances backed by personal charisma, his honeymoon is at an all-time high. Post-marital blues for now can safely be postponed.

Release more spectrum for commercial use: Jon Fredrik BaksaasRelease more spectrum for commercial use: Jon Fredrik Baksaas
Sounak Mitra & Surajeet Das Gupta |  Oct 11, 2014 12:32 AM IST
President and Chief Executive Jon Fredrik Baksaas, the chairman for GSMA that lobbies for cellular operators worldwide, believes the over-the-top application providers, as part of the ecosystem, should come forward to share the cost of distribution. He talks to Sounak Mitra and Surajeet Das Gupta. Excerpts:
Telenor, which owns 100 per cent in the Indian entity, has a limited presence in just seven circles. When would Telenor look at a pan-India presence?
There is no plan at this moment. We have increased our footprints in existing circles. A pan-India presence for Uninor, which is the operating company of Telenor in India, will depend on the government's decision on the two important regulatory issues - merger and acquisition (M&A) norms and freeing up more spectrum for commercial usage.
Globally, many countries release nearly 100 per cent spectrum for commercial use, but in India, a comparably smaller amount of spectrum is released. This needs to be changed. If spectrum availability is there, we'll look for possible opportunities, if it's of any strategic value.
There is more spectrum available, and there is a demand. In the government's Digital India initiative, the cellular services industry is one of the important parts. Availability of more spectrum for commercial use will help the industry.
Globally, OTTs are eating into messaging revenues of telecom operators. There have been discussions on whether OTTs should share revenues with the operators. What is your take on this?
OTTs are a very important part of the ecosystem. OTTs, telecom operators and other interlinked services work well together if they are tuned together. The operators, in the ecosystem, are making significant investments in each market, creating employments; they pay taxes. And we do enable things to happen. Operators are also regulated. The OTTs are not regulated. They don't make that much investment locally; they don't create that much employment locally. But, they are also a very attractive part of the ecosystem that works in any country. This could be better understood, and better aligned. The issue of sharing revenues is coming forward more clearly when video and streaming came into the picture. Video and streaming consumes huge bandwidth. It requires better traffic management, and investments by the operators to ensure required data volume. There is a cost attached to distribution, specifically for quality services that demands good bandwidth. This cost can't be borne only by the operators. However, the whole issue would take many discussions in the coming days.
Some telcos have launched OTT applications. How healthy it could be for the industry?
There have been such instances, and there would be more in future. There are challenges for operators, and many are looking at different ways to counter those. Operators, in any case, understand the local culture better than just the applications developers who don't have a real presence in a country.
Telenor has long-term evolution (LTE) services in five countries in 1,800 Mhz band. Will you look at entering the 4G game in India anytime soon?
In the longer scheme of things, we may look at converting part of the spectrum, which is currently being used for 2G, for more data-driven services. However, it is linked to affordability of smartphones as well. Most of India is actually not matured for LTE. There are pockets which are ready for this. However, it would take time for the market to become LTE ready. We are an innovative company that sticks to its 'sabse sasta' strategy. For us, it may take three-four years to look at an alternative data services for our consumers. We may not have the best network, but we have the network that is capable of offering good working services where we are present. This has helped us to get more than 40 million customers. In three years time market will be mature, and we aim to have 50 per cent internet using customers from 20 per cent as of now.
Telenor has mobile banking services in many countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Thailand. Will you bring that to India?
The government has taken a good step forward by deciding to allow even telecom operators to offer basic banking services. In many countries, we are leading mobile money services. We welcome the structure and we will surely have look at it. The Indian authorities have issued draft guidelines for setting up Payment Banks. We will definitely explore the options once the final guidelines are in place.

The Transgender group on Friday met Finance Minister Eatala Rajender at the Secretariat demanding establishment of a statutory Hijra, Intersex and Transgender Welfare Board to coordinate between various government departments for extension of government benefits to the community.
Led by Mudraboina Rachana, a volunteer of Telangana Hijra, Intersex and Transgender Samiti, whose members from ten districts of Telangana, organised a dharna at Indira Park earlier, the group also demanded an exclusive housing project and a burial ground for the community.
They wanted reservations in employment and education and at least one hospital in whole of the State to offer free sex reassignment surgeries, counselling and hormone replacement therapy to them.
At present, such hospitals existed in Tamil Nadu and Mumbai, while quacks performed the surgeries in Vijayawada.
They explained their problems to the Minister in accessing public transport and toilets, marriage and adoptions. Toilets without gendered signs should be built in public areas. They wanted abolition of Hyderabad Eunuch Act and other discriminatory laws. Instead, a legislation criminalising specific forms of violence routinely faced by the Transgender community should be enacted.
They also asked for ration cards, passports, PAN, voter ID cards and other documents to obtain bank accounts and cooking gas connections.
Rachana told reporters that the Samiti was keen to know the stand of Telangana government on the Supreme Court judgement that recognised Hijras as third gender.

Sensex down 25 points; Infosys plunges 4.7% ahead of Q2 earningsSensex down 25 points; Infosys plunges 4.7% ahead of Q2 earnings
PTI  Mumbai, October 08, 2014
First Published: 10:01 IST(8/10/2014) | Last Updated: 20:33 IST(8/10/2014)
Comments
In highly volatile trade, the BSE benchmark Sensex on Wednesday lost 25 points to close at fresh two- month low of 26,246.79, as IT stocks, particularly Infosys, were battered after Citigroup downgraded India's second largest software exporter, amid persistent fund outflows.
After opening in the negative zone at 26,229.67, the Sensex slipped further to touch the day's low of 26,150.09 on continued capital outflows, tracking weak global cues.
Buying in select blue-chip stocks wiped off early losses and the barometer rose to day's high of 26,338.31. It settled at 26,246.79, 25.18 points lower than its previous close, completing the third straight session of losses.
The NSE 50-share Nifty also moved down by 9.70 points or 0.12% to finish at 7,842.70.
Ahead of its July-September quarter earnings announcement, Infosys plunged 4.70%, the biggest loss among Sensex companies, after global financial services major Citigroup has downgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'buy', dragging the BSE IT sector index by 3.44%.
Following the dip in the stock, the company's market value tumbled Rs. 10,341.31 crore to Rs. 2,09,607.69 crore. Wipro and TCS also lost 4.03% and 1.90% respectively.
Brokers said fresh buying in capital goods, refinery, metal, banking, power, realty and auto sectors mainly helped the market to cut short its early losses. Fall in crude oil prices in the global market also supported the late rebound.
"The large part of today's (Wednesday's) fall is due to under-performance in IT sector, but in the near term performance will depend on Q2 FY15 performance... Tracking the global cues, the markets today opened with a weak note and stayed subdued throughout the day.
"The weak German data, the IMF decision to cut the global growth and slight fall in the Chinese services data were the reasons for the global sell off. Also the starting of the domestic earnings season also kept away the investors from creating fresh open positions," Geojit BNP Paribas said.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs. 332.84 crore on Tuesday, as per provisional exchange data.

Meeting point: here s why Zuckerberg  Modi need each otherComments
In the hurly-burly of Indian politics dominated by dynasties and towering figures, Narendra Modi was an outlier, who emerged from his humble origins as a Vadnagar tea seller to become the Prime Minister of the world’s largest democracy.
In the class-conscious world of high-achievers and Ivy League snobbery called Harvard University, an outlier Jew of simple origins from the small town of Dobbs Ferry, Mark Zuckerburg founded a company that put him in the global league of billionaires at the young age of 23.
Both of  them are connected by Facebook.
The social network that  Zuckerberg, now 30, used to gather fame and fortune in a short time-frame was used by Modi to acquire power and prominence in a nation of one billion people in an equally short time.
How many people do we know who are welcomed to the White House by the President of the United States after being denied a visa by Washington for his alleged transgressions in religious violence?
As it happens Zuckerberg, on a two-day visit to India, and Modi are set to meet – and in fact, need each other. Here’s how.
Modi swept to power with help from Facebook and Twitter, aided by hundreds of millions of young voters  who tracked his moves and cheered him on social media sites. But he needs these people, and hundreds of millions more, to be galvanized into action for him to fulfill his electoral promises.
Zuckerberg needs the same millions, and even more people, to fulfill the promise he has made to Wall Street. He has to turn them into consumers whose eyeballs serve advertisers.
Facebook has 108 million active users in India, second only to the US, where it has about 180 million.
Zuckerberg, 30 years old and having an estimated wealth of $30 billion (about Rs. 180,000 crore) is expecting to ride partnerships with telecom service providers  and makers of cheap Facebook-enabled smart feature phones to convert more and more of 900 million mobile phone subscribers into Facebook users as part of his Internet.org initiative.
Modi may use the very same base to get across his messages on policies and politics --- such as his pet Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan (Clean India Movement).
This is no easy win-win agreement.
Modi has to prove that Facebook  has to be free from hate speeches or campaigns (including from his own overzealous supporters). He also has to ensure that hardline provisions such as Section 66 of the Information Technology Act ( which prescribes 'punishment for sending offensive messages through communication services), are not used to curb freedom of expression – as it seems to have happened now and then. At the same time, there have also been unruly protests against Facebook posts in some parts of India.  Modi has to ensure protection to this freedom.
Zuckerberg needs  to convince Modi that a US company can act in Indian interest, and Facebook will not be used to snoop into the privacy of users or conduct questionable market research.  Facebook, as the world’s top social network, needs to be sensitive to Indian security concerns as well as address critcism that its orientation is merely consumerist, and not social.
As famous small town outliers who made it big in a tough world, Modi and Zuckerberg have a lot in common – but will also need an uncommon bond to make their relationship fruitful.

Rupee gains 35 paise to hit one-week high of 61.05 against US dollarComments
Rising for the fourth straight session, the rupee on Thursday rose by 35 paise to end at over one-week high of 61.05 against the dollar on persistent selling of the US currency from banks and exporters tracking global cues amid a surge in local equities.
The rupee resumed higher at 61.13 per dollar as against Wednesday's closing level of 61.40 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) and strengthened further to 60.90 per dollar before ending at 61.05 per dollar, a gain of 35 paise or 0.57%. The domestic unit moved in a range of 60.90 and 61.14 per dollar during the day.
This is rupee's biggest closing level since 60.96 on September 24.
It has gained by 70 paise or 1.13% in the last four trading days.
"Strength in equity markets after recent correction and outflows provided strength to the rupee. RBI announced an OMO of Rs. 10,000 crore to suck liquidity from the market," said Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, director and CEO, WealthRays Securities.
In London, the dollar fell to a three-week low against the yen on Thursday as investors cut favourable bets after minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting prompted many to push out expectations for the likely timing of an interest rate rise.
The BSE benchmark Sensex ended higher by 390.49 points or 1.49% to 26,637.28.
FPIs/FIIs pulled out a massive Rs. 1,440.99 crore from local equities on Wednesday, as per exchange data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said, "The rupee gained today (Thursday) as local equities traded strong and closed up by 1.49% for the day.
"The rupee is expected to appreciate further taking cues from the positive sentiment in the market but importers will invest to grab the advantage of this gain which will keep the local currency under pressure".
In the forward market, premium ended lower on persistent receipts by exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in March closed lower at 224-226 from Wednesday's closing level of 228-230 paise and far-forward contracts maturing in September, 2015 also ended lower at 461.5-463.5 as against 463-465 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.0368 and for the euro at 77.7426.
The rupee fell against the pound sterling to 98.98 from the previous close of 98.66 and also fell to 77.95 per euro from 77.68 previously.
It also eased further to 56.71 per 100 yen from 56.70 on Wednesday.

Wall Street rebounds after slump; chipmakers hit NasdaqWall Street rebounds after slump; chipmakers hit Nasdaq
By Reuters | 10 Oct, 2014, 07.40PM IST
The Dow and S&P 500 rose on Friday, modestly rebounding after a sharp decline in the previous session.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: The Dow and S&P 500 rose on Friday, modestly rebounding after a sharp decline in the previous session, though weakness in chipmakers limited the Nasdaq's advance.
Major indexes remained on track for a sharply lower week as investors continued to fret about the pace of global growth and its impact on corporate earnings .
Semiconductor stocks slumped after Microchip Technology Inc warned on sales and said an industry correction had begun. The company, whose shares lost 11.5 per cent to $40.25, also said more bad news could be on the way from other chipmakers.
Intel Corp fell 2.4 per cent to $32.77 while Texas Instruments sank 6.8 per cent to $42.87 and Micron Tech lost 6.1 per cent to $28.77. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index fell 4.8 per cent and is on track for its biggest weekly decline since May 2012.
"Investors may have to worry beyond Friday about the consequences of the Microchip warning," Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group, wrote in a note. He added that the group was a possible "canary in the coalmine."
The S&P closed below its 150-day moving average for the first time since November 2012 on Thursday, a sign that near-term trends are weaker. The next technical level in view is the S&P's 200-day moving average, which at 1,904.84 is 1.2 per cent below Thursday's close.
"All eyes will be on the 200-day moving average" today, said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners in Greenwich, Connecticut, adding that the index would test that level before the current pullback ends.
"At that point we can evaluate the structure to determine (if) a bigger pullback is at hand."
This week's declines were spurred by weak data from Germany, Europe's largest economy, as well as comments from a Fed official who suggested investors had unrealistic expectations about the Fed's eventual rate increase.
Recent strength in the dollar - which is down 1 per cent this week but is coming off a 12-week rally - has contributed to concerns about earnings for multinational companies, though some early results, including from Alcoa Inc and PepsiCo Inc , were stronger than expected.
At 9:46 a.m. the Dow Jones industrial average rose 86.89 points, or 0.52 per cent, to 16,746.14, the S&P 500 gained 7.97 points, or 0.41 per cent, to 1,936.18 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.40 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 4,377.94.
For the week, the Dow is down 1.6 per cent, the S&P is down 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq is down 2.3 per cent. It is the third straight weekly decline for all three.
Advancing issues were outnumbering declining ones on the NYSE by 1,556 to 1,224, for a 1.27-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,266 issues were rising and 1,038 falling for a 1.22-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 2 new 52-week highs and 34 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 6 new highs and 156 new lows.

(The def ministry has…)
NEW DELHI: The Defence Ministry has issued a fresh tender for buying 20 Hawk trainer aircraft for around Rs 2,000 crore after the original file related to the procurement went missing leading to delays in the acquisition process.
A fresh Request for Proposal (RFP) has been issued to the state-owned HAL for procuring 20 additional Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer aircraft for Air Force's Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team ( SKAT ), Defence Ministry sources said here.
The original file related to the tender had gone missing and the process had to be restarted by the Government, they said.
The defence ministry has taken a serious view of the lapses on part of the officials handling the file and an inquiry has been ordered, officials said.
Disciplinary proceedings would be initiated against officials who are found responsible for the lapses, they said.
India has, so far, placed orders for 123 Hawks with the British BAE Systems in two phases. The first order for 66 aircraft was placed by India in 2004, of which more than 40 have already arrived. The second order for 57 aircraft was placed in June last year.

German downturn casts shadow over world economyGerman downturn casts shadow over world economy

(It looks like Germany, Europe's…)
FRANKFURT: As if the global economy didn't have enough troubles, it looks like Germany, Europe's traditional growth engine, risks falling into recession, or growth so weak it holds back the entire euro currency union's weak recovery.
Europe's largest economy has seen a run of lousy numbers for factory orders, industrial production, exports and business confidence. All that's bad news because exporting industrial goods such as machines and cars is the heart of Germany's globally linked economy.
And if Germany isn't selling goods, it suggests other parts of the world's economy are not strong enough to keep buying them.
Global stock markets tumbled this week, in part due to the German figures, with the USlogging its worst day of the year on Thursday. Germany's DAX blue chip index was down a painful 2 percent on Friday.
But are things in Germany all that bad? Economists are debating whether it's really time to use the R-word and predict a shallow recession. That would be another quarter of negative output in the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, following shrinkage of 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.
Here are the key issues.
AS GERMANY GOES: So does Europe, in many ways. Strong business activity in Germany has made the overall growth figure for the 18 countries that use the euro look a lot better in the past few years. And Europe showed zero growth in the second quarter. Germany is 28 per cent of European GDP. And the value chain for companies in other countries often runs through Germany. Suppliers in Italy or France, for example, sell chemicals, coatings or parts to a Germany company that assembles the final factory machine or car.
GLOBALLY SPEAKING: A renewed slump, or long-term stagnation in Europe is a risk for the global economy as a whole. That's one reason why International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde keeps urging more stimulus for the region. The European Union, of which Germany is the biggest economy, is the world's largest economy and trading bloc. It's a key export market for many firms in the U.S., and a source of investment capital, big-ticket goods and technology for China. In particular, USauto firms such as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors, through its Opel subsidiary, have struggled through a long slump in consumer demand for cars in Europe.
 
STIMULUS NEEDED: Things in Europe are so worrisome that the European Central Bank is launching more stimulus measures. It cut its interest rate to near zero and is preparing to purchase bundles of bank loans to encourage more lending. Yet even bank President Mario Draghi has warned that the stimulus will not be effective unless several eurozone governments act to make their economies more business-friendly. France and Italy are often mentioned as countries that could make labor rules more flexible to encourage hiring and investment. But progress is slow.
THE PUTIN EFFECT: Germany makes what economists call investment goods _ big-ticket items like printing presses, heavy trucks, or industrial lasers that companies use to make other goods. Uncertainty makes businesses and consumers hesitate, because they can always put off such purchases until things look a little clearer. That's the effect of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in the EU and the USimposing economic sanctions on Moscow. Business in the Middle East has also been dented by military conflict in Syria and Iraq.
IN THE BLACK: Some say Germany can help right its economy by spending more. It has good public finances, after all. But Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has focused on balancing the budget, even as her governing partners, the Social Democrats, have called for more investment spending to fix roads and bridges. Germany can borrow money for essentially zero interest on bond markets; even its longer 10-year bonds yield an astonishingly low 0.91 per cent annually, compared with 2.31 per cent for US10-year Treasuries.
But Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has made it clear the government's in no mood to increase borrowing.
DON'T PANIC: Andreas Rees, chief Germany economist at Unicredit, says he's ``not in the doomsday camp'' predicting a recession. He points out that the German economy has several ``airbags'' to cushion the bumps and help growth resume. Those include low unemployment of only 4.9 per cent, which supports consumer demand from Germany's large domestic market. A weaker euro _ which has dropped to $1.26 from $1.39 in May _ should help exporters in coming months. And growth in the USeconomy should provide more demand for German exports.
In particular, Rees points to a calendar effect that made the latest figures industrial production and exports look particularly bad. Summer vacations were bunched up in August, shutting auto plants at the same time.
LOOKING FORWARD: Rees says the next reading of the Ifo institute's business confidence survey _ a closely watched indicator of where the economy may be going in the months ahead _ will be a key indicator of how things are developing. It's out Oct. 27.

Satyarthi  Malala to work for Indo-Pak peace | Malala invites Modi  Sharif to Nobel ceremonyMalala
(Malala said she and Satyarthi…)
LONDON: Indian Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi and Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai today agreed to work jointly to build "strong relations" between their countries, amid growing tensions along the border.
"We will work together and try to build strong relations" between India and Pakistan, she said, adding that it was "really disappointing" that India and Pakistan were engaged in confrontation.
"We want to have good relations...I really believe in peace," the 17-year-old told reporters after being chosen for the coveted prize along with Satyarthi.
She said it was important to have progress and development instead of fighting.
Malala said she and Satyarthi would appeal to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to join them (in Oslo) for the award ceremony in December.
She also made a "humble request" to Sharif and Modi to ensure peace.
60-year-old Satyarthi, who gave up his job as an electrical engineer to run an NGO in India for rescuing children from forced labour and trafficking, and 17-year-old Malala, who survived a near-fatal Taliban attack two years ago with determination advocating education for girls, were named by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee for the prestigious global award this year.
Malala said she was "honoured" to be the first Pakistani and the youngest person to be given the award and dedicated the award to the "voiceless".
"This award is for all those children who are voiceless, whose voices need to be heard," she said.

G20 hits out at U.S. Congress on IMF reformUpdated: October 12, 2014 04:58 IST
G20 hits out at U.S. Congress on IMF reform

TOPICS
USA
The G20 group of major economies’ Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors had sharp words for the U.S. Congress on Friday, with the Group Treasurer describing Capitol Hill as being a “very difficult… obstacle” in their bid to pass internal reform of the International Monetary Fund.
Issuing the Group’s statement during the Fund and World Bank annual fall meetings in Washington, Australian Finance Minister Joe Hockey, whose nation currently holds the Group’s presidency said, ”It does affect the U.S. and their reputation, when there is global agreement and in fact agreement from the White House to undertake IMF reform… For domestic reasons the U.S. Congress might not be moving on this issue but for global reasons the U.S. should move on this issue.”
More broadly, the Ministers and Governors said regarding the world economy, “While some key economies are recovering, others face renewed weakness.” Their statement also emphasised an agreement regarding a Global Infrastructure Initiative, and a Global Infrastructure Hub to support the Initiative, to be finalised before the Group leaders’ summit in November.
The issue of reforming both Bretton Woods institutions has been a long-standing struggle particularly for emerging economic powers such as India and China, who have consistently argued that the changing dynamics of global economic power favours their economies in the realm of growth and market size and it was high time that the Bank and Fund’s constituent structure reflected this new reality.
In 2011, shortly before the announcement of the candidacy of current IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, its Executive Directors from the BRICS economies openly revolted against the prospect of the top role reverting to a European, deepening the woes of an organisation that was recently rocked to its very core by the resignation of former Dominique Strauss-Kahn following sexual assault allegations.
At the group of EDs, including erstwhile India representative Arvind Virmani, called for the abandonment of the “obsolete unwritten convention,” that required the head of the IMF necessarily to be from Europe, arguing that the 2008 global financial crisis actually erupted in developed countries and its provenance “underscored the urgency of reforming international financial institutions so as to reflect the growing role of developing countries in the world economy.”
This week Mr. Hockey echoed that sentiment and targeted the role of the U.S. Congress when he said, “I would say to Congressmen and the Senate, for the record, it is in the best interest of the U.S. to support the reform of the IMF, because everyone needs to have a proper voice at the table. It weakens the position of the U.S. if it is the sole Congress that remains an obstacle to the reform of a very important safety net.”
The Treasurer added that the G20 wanted the IMF to be “well resourced, well respected and well prepared,” and the best way to do that is to help it with its own reforms.

Amazon Is Opening an Actual StoreComing to you soon, in 3-D.
Photo by Nicholas Kamm/AFP/GettyImages
File this one under #innovation. Online retailing giant Amazon is planning its first brick-and-mortar store , the Wall Street Journal reports, and it's going to be a big deal. According to the Journal, the real-life Everything Store at 7 West 34th St. in Manhattan will push the boundaries of commerce with revolutionary in-store services that include:
Receiving same-day delivery items
Facilitating product returns and exchanges
Allowing customers to pick up online orders
Highlighting Amazon inventory
Advertisement
The ambitious project is also risky. The Journal notes that operating a physical store could force Amazon to take on retailing costs it thus far "has largely avoided." These include leasing a space for the store and paying employees to work there. The added expenses could prove dangerous to the thin profit margins that Amazon's Jeff Bezos is famous for maintaining.
Amazon has toyed with the idea of a physical store before. Last November, the company opened pop-up shops in U.S. malls to sell its Kindle tablets and e-readers. As it turns out, physical stores for online retailers is something of a trend—some call it trading " clicks for bricks ." In 2013, Etsy opened a pop-up store in New York City and eBay teamed up with Kate Spade to create temporary storefronts . Online eyeglasses seller Warby Parker has also experimented with physical locations .
Other online retailers have tried to strike a balance between the physical and digital worlds. Companies like Trunk Club and Stitch Fix , which regularly send their subscribers a sampler of items, are built around the notion of trying to bring an in-store shopping experience to your living room. Either way, nothing says disruption quite like turning our online experiences into IRL ones .

$547 000 for a parking space in Hong Kong$547,000 for a parking space in Hong Kong
By Sophia Yan   @sophia_yan October 9, 2014: 11:11 PM ET
HONG KONG (CNNMoney)
Forget a sea view mansion. In Hong Kong, parking spaces are some of the hottest properties on the market.
Eager buyers in this densely populated city have pushed prices to record highs in recent months, with prime spaces now selling for far more than the luxury cars that park in them.
In May, a single space in a residential neighborhood on Hong Kong Island went for 4.24 million Hong Kong dollars ($547,000), making it the most expensive parking space ever sold in the territory.
The quirky market is being driven by a combination of factors: Low supply, high demand, and speculators who view parking spaces as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity.
"I am surprised how much interest there is on the market about buying and selling parking spaces," said KK Wong of Hong Kong City Parking. "Five years back, nobody would even be asking."
With land at a premium, most Hong Kong homes don't come with a driveway or garage, and even luxury apartment buildings don't always offer car parking. The result is a total of 683,000 parking spots for a population that exceeds 7 million.
Related: Mansions for under $1 million
The parking spot craze started heating up a few years ago, when the city government introduced new taxes to help cool the residential property market and drive out speculators.
The strategy worked, but some investors shifted their money into parking spaces, which were exempt from the tax. Owners were able to resell the tiny properties, or rent them out for a profit.
 
Hong Kong's housing at its worst
Wong, who operates several parking lots and a listings website, said the flood of new investment dollars pushed prices higher, and further diminished the number of available parking spots.
Near the market's peak in 2012, buyers were offering as much as $640,000 for a single parking space.
Related: Big dogs suffer as Hong Kong status symbols
The government eventually closed the loophole, levying a tax that also covered the purchase of parking spaces. "That put some cold water onto the market," Wong said, "But it's heating up again."
The number of registered parking spots sold in August climbed to 956, a 29% increase from July and the highest in 20 months, said Thomas Lam, a senior director at real estate firm Knight Frank.
Because Hong Kong boasts one of the world's lowest car ownership rates, with only about 62 cars per 1,000 people, most city residents are able to avoid the pain of rising prices.
But having a car is still a must for some Hong Kongers. Owning one car (or several) is a status symbol , and indicates the car owner also has the money to buy a pricey spot to park the vehicle.
"In America, a car is a necessity; in Hong Kong, it's a luxury -- [public] transportation is really efficient," said Buggle Lau of Midland Realty. "And if you buy a car, you also need to buy a car park."

Investors needn’t be euphoric after Infosys Q2 performance

Earnings Announcement
(Infosys reported a consolidated…)
MUMBAI: Infosys, one of India's largest IT services exporter, surprised the Street with better than expected bottom line and margins. The company has also maintained its FY15 revenue guidance at 7-9 per cent.
The stock has rallied over 5 per cent on the back of strong PAT and the company's decision to issue bonus shares.
Infosys reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3096 crore for the quarter ended September 30, up 7.27 per cent, from Rs 2886 crore in previous quarter. The net profit is better than ET Now poll estimate of Rs 2864.4 crore.
"This quarter was slightly better than our expectations on the growth front and as well as on the bottom line front. The fact that they have been able to retain their guidance in this quarter for the annual numbers clearly suggests that in the upcoming quarters also, they are looking at a reasonable amount of growth coming in," said Rajiv Mehta, EVP Research Analyst, IIFL India Private Clients to ET Now.
So does Infosys make a good buy at current levels?
According to initial reactions from analysts tracking the stock, investors should not read too much in Q2 results and be cautious of the stock.
"The numbers came out pretty well but I will not be so euphoric right now. The reason is this is the last quarter where the existing management had executed on. The strategy is still the same that the old management went on," said Trip Chowdhry, Global Equities Research.
"We have a new management in place where new strategies which will take shape and it will take a few quarters to get the whole strategy play around. I do not think investors should jump on the stock based on the current numbers," he added.
According to Mehta, while the guidance suggests that the second half is going to be reasonably good, the risk reward is not favourable.
"We think that given the kind of run-up in the share price that we have seen and especially today with these kind of numbers, incremental upside in the stock in the short to medium term seems to be limited. So we would not want to change our neutral or a market performer rating on the stock unless we really find something exciting in the conference call from a strategic point of view," Mehta told ET Now.
At 10:25 a.m.; the stock was at Rs 3,881.70, up 6.48 per cent, on the BSE. It touched a high of Rs 3886.80 and a low of Rs 3600 in trade today.

I make six figures to play video gamesI make six figures playing video games

I make six figures playing video games
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
What do LeBron James, Peyton Manning and Choi Seong-Hun have in common? People pay them a lot of money to play games.
Seong-Hun, or "Polt" as he's known on the battlefield, is a professional video game player. He is currently one of the best Starcraft II players in the world, ranked number four in the game's global standings.
And life as a celebrity among the Terran, Protoss and Zerg races is lucrative. For his work on the fictional planets of the Koprulu sector, Seong-Hun makes at least six figures a year in Earth dollars.
"People think we just play video games... [but] the game I'm playing right now is real-time strategy," Seong-Hun says. "I have to counter strategy to my opponent's. It's similar to rock, paper, scissors -- if I keep playing rocks again and again, I will lose every game."
Polt (a name chosen based on a favorite character from childhood) has made a career in the rising industry of E-Sports. As video game tournaments gain popularity, events have come to resemble professional athletic events: spectators fill theaters, even stadiums, to watch gamers duke it out live in the virtual world.
It's a growing business. The number of video game competitions has increased from about 9,000 in 2011 to roughly 47,500 this year, according to Battlefy, a software company for managing e-sports competitions. Competitions range from small, intercollegiate tournaments to this month's League of Legends world championship, which will be held in Seoul's 60,000-seat World Cup Stadium.
Beyond that, there's the huge audience such events garner online: more than 71 million people watch -- that's watch, not play -- video games online or on TV, according to SuperData Research. Last year's League of Legends championship had a combined viewership of 32 million, compared to 26 million TV viewers for the NBA Finals.
Like professional athletes, the highest echelons of gamers are becoming bona fide stars -- complete with sponsors and devoted fan bases.
Related: See EA's new FIFA 15
In Polt's case, his standing has not only landed him endorsements, but remarkably, a P-1A U.S. visa -- the kind typically reserved for professional athletes in sports like baseball. He practices his craft six to eight hours a day for which he is paid a salary. So win or lose, gaming earns him a steady stream of income.
"In terms of money, it's really good," Polt says.
Like NASCAR, his very presence has become a marketing opportunity. He plays as CMStormPolt, short for Cooler Master, a company that makes equipment for gamers like keyboards and headsets.
While there is a sizable fan base for Starcraft II in the United States, none of the game's champions are American. Polt's U.S. visa has made him the closest thing to a U.S. Starcraft player, earning the South Korean-born gamer the sobriquet, "Captain America."
Ironically, Polt was unfamiliar with the character until he heard fans chanting it when he took the stage.
Now, he says, "Captain America is my favorite hero."
In late September, Polt played in front of a packed house in Washington, D.C., at the Red Bull Battle Grounds competition, an experience that feels somewhere between a rave and Broadway show. 1,200 people watched, boo-ing and cheering with every shot and the destruction of every base.
After a fatal mistake in one critical round, Polt took third place. Roughly seven hours of work netted him $6,000.
"It's not the best result for me, but...I feel pretty good right now," he said.
He turned back around and walked into a line of fans, patiently waiting for autographs.

NEW YORK: The American Depository Receipts of Infosys today gained nearly 6 per cent in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange on the back of IT major reporting better than expected quarterly results.
Infosys saw its consolidated net profit jump 28.6 per cent to Rs 3,096 crore in the September quarter. The company also recommended a bonus issue of one equity share for every equity share held and a bonus issue of a stock dividend of one American Depositary Share (ADS) for every ADS held, respectively.
The company's ADR soared nearly 6 per cent to $62.66 in early trade and at that level, the market capitalisation touched about $35.85 billion.
The ADR opened at $62.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.
However, the broader market was trading marginally higher. The benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Index was almost flat at 16,639.48 points while the S&P 500 index inched up to 1,920.96 points.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose more than one per cent to 4,329.53 points.
In the Indian market too, Infosys shares gained significantly. The scrip jumped nearly 7 per cent to close at Rs 3,888.95 on the BSE while it rose 6.51 per cent to settle at Rs 3,884.20 on the NSE.

While growing up, Satyarthi has said he was concerned about the plight of child labourers around him and it finally prompted him to start an organised movement.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi gave up his job as an electrical engineer to dedicate himself to protecting and advancing child rights for over three decades now, freeing 80,000 child labourers and giving them new hope in life.
It is largely due to his doggedness and zeal that NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan has emerged as by far the most prominent child rights group in the country even as 60-year-old Satyarthi rose to become a global voice for the children's cause.
He has passionately argued that child trafficking and labour perpetuate poverty, unemployment, illiteracy and population growth.
From the factories exploiting children in the country's biggest cities like Delhi and Mumbai to the hinterland of Odisha and Jharkhand where children are still illegally employed as bonded labourers, his organisation has rescued them in almost all parts of country.
He has advocated for stricter laws against child trafficking and labour and met with mixed success so far.
While growing up, Satyarthi has said he was concerned about the plight of child labourers around him and it finally prompted him to start an organised movement.
His early attempts to raid factories employing child labourers met with hostile reaction from the factory owners and at times the police but the significance of his work was slowly recognised.
He also played an important role in the movement for Right to Education law for free compulsory education to children.
Several prestigious awards have been conferred on him, including Defenders of Democracy Award (2009-US), Medal of the Italian Senate (2007-Italy), Robert F Kennedy International Human Rights Award (USA) and Fredric Ebert International Human Rights Award (Germany) etc.
He created the Global March Against Child Labour, a movement that is active in many countries. He is also credited with establishing Rugmark, now known as Good Weave, in 1994. It is a kind of social certification for child labour free carpets in South Asia.
Satyarthi has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize many times in the past for his his relentless crusade for defending child rights
Satyarthi is the first India-born person to have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the seventh Indian Nobel laureate. Mother Teresa, who was born in Albania, was the first Indian Nobel peace prize winner. She was honoured in 1979.
KAILASH SATYARTHI
January 11, 1954, in Vidisha, India.
EARLY YEARS
As a boy, Satyarthi was moved by other children who had to work, and whose parents were too poor to send them to school. He started a football club with membership fees paying the school fees of needy children. He and a friend collected donations of 2,000 schoolbooks in a single day, a project that eventually became a book bank in his town.
FIGHTING CHILD LABOR IN INDIA
Satyarthi has helped free children from slave-labor conditions and advocated for reforms, as director of the South Asia Coalition on Child Servitude and leader of Bachpan Bachao Andolan. In 1994, he founded a group now known as Goodweave, which certifies child-labor-free rugs and provides assistance to rescued and at-risk children.
GLOBAL MARCH AGAINST CHILD LABOR
In 1998, Satyarthi was chairman of a global march against child labor that wound through more than 60 countries around the world. Children rescued from jobs in Asia, Africa and Latin America were among more than 1,000 people who ended the march in Geneva, at a conference of the International Labor Organization. A year later, the ILO approved an accord designed to protect children from jobs that expose them to danger or exploitation.
AWARDS
Many, including the Aachen Peace Prize (1994), the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights Award (1995), Friedrich Ebert Stiftung Human Rights Award (1999), and Parliamentarians for Global Action's Defender of Democracy Award (2009).
FAMILY
Married with two children.
QUOTE
"Child slavery is a crime against humanity. Humanity itself is at stake here. A lot of work still remains but I will see the end of child labor in my lifetime."

12 left: Another nation loses AAA ratingAnother nation stripped of AAA rating

Finland was stripped of its pristine AAA long-term credit rating Friday as a top ratings agency views threats to the nation’s economy. Just 12 nations still have perfect ratings.
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service cut its long-term foreign credit rating on the Nordic country by one notch to AA+ — just as investors are getting increasingly worried about Europe’s economy.
It’s the latest nation to be stripped of its perfect AAA rating — leaving just 12 countries in the world at AAA. The U.S. lost its AAA rating from S&P in August 2011. Separately, S&P downgraded the outlook on France’s debt to negative to stable — in just the latest blow to investors’ perception of Europe. France’s debt is still rated AA.
Finland was taken down a notch for a bevy of reasons cited by S&P, including a downward revision to the nation’s economic future. A tougher economy means the nation might have a more difficult time cutting public debt.
S&P spelled out its rationale for the downgrade in one sentence: “The downgrade reflects our view of the risk that the Finnish economy could experience protracted stagnation because of its aging population and shrinking workforce, weakening external demand, loss of global market share in the key information technology sector, structural retrenchment of the important forestry sector, and relatively rigid labor market,” it said in the report.
Finland’s downgrade is just the latest in what’s been a whittling down of the credit health of the world’s nations.
The nations that still have AAA ratings from S&P include:

(He is a soft-spoken Gandhian…)
By Asmita
I rushed to meet my father at his office as soon as I heard the news about him winning the Nobel Peace Prize. He didn't seem to be as excited as I was. "Gandhiji should have won it before me." Those were his first words to me.
He is a soft-spoken Gandhian on normal days. Today, he was also unperturbed. I saw him for 15 minutes after the announcement, before the media took over.
My father has, over the years been involved with a host of social issues, from anti-smoking campaigns to his most important work through his NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan , which has helped free and rehabilitate several thousand children from child labour. He is also a big animal lover, calling our dog "our third child".
His work with Bachpan Bachao Andolan, however, has not always been smooth. In their attempt to rescue
children, his team and he have often run into trouble with child traffickers and employers who have threatened and inflicted violence.
He has been attacked several times and threats over the phone at home were not uncommon. I had to go to study in the US because of this. We would get threats at home about me, stuff like that. But he has always been a great father. Despite the threats, we have always supported and understood his wish to reach out and improve the lives of children. My mother, Sumedha Kailash, and elder brother Bhuvan Ribhu, also actively work with my father's NGO.
When he decided to quit his teaching job at a college in Vidisha, my mother's family was very unhappy. They were not too happy anyway, because they had eloped and married. His decision to quit gave my maternal parents another reason to disown my mother. But my mother supported him through very difficult times.
The family has had no time to sit together yet and have a conversation about my father winning the Nobel Prize . I haven't really discussed it with him, but it's a proud moment. Given the recent border violence with Pakistan, it's a great statement for peace, for India and Pakistan.
Some of my father's friends had nominated him earlier for the award. But because the Nobel Peace Prize committee is really secretive, nobody had much idea what was happening. This year it was a complete and total shocker.

Perils of corruption: a note from Hoysala rulerhistory
An inscription found at the temple of Penneshwaramadam reserves “an extreme form of contempt” for the corrupt in public life
As the debate continues on the ills of corruption in public life, in the interior of Krishnagiri district, the temple of Penneshwaramadam, on the banks of the Thenpennai, bears an inscription that reserves “an extreme form of contempt” for the corrupt in public life.
Perhaps, the Supreme Court’s recent verdict, terming corruption in public life “a human rights violation,” reflects this sentiment.
In the later Chola era temple is etched the 13th century inscription of an order issued by Hoysala ruler Veera Ramanatha, dated regnal year 46. It reads: “Anybody seeking cooked food or indulging in other corrupt practices in Pennaiyaandaarmadam and its endowed land (pennai yaandar devadana oorgalilum) shall be beheaded, and any official (Kannakkar, Adhigaarigal) refusing to act on this order will face a similar fate.”
The translation of the inscription in the Tamil Grantha script has been recorded by Su. Rajagopal and Su. Krishnamoorthy of the State Department of Archaeology, says Sugavana Murugan of the District Archaeology Centre.
The inscription also holds to account “the public official looking the other way as much as the doer of corruption,” a point that came through in the verdict in the assets case against the former Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa.
There are several inscriptions that speak of imposition of fine on temple officials and confiscation of their property for pilfering temple property. Significantly, this inscription speaks of capital punishment for corrupt officials, reflecting the character of the Hoysala ruler, says an eminent archaeologist.
The Utharamerur inscriptions of 921 AD, issued by Paranthaka Chola, set out the code of conduct for contesting elections. “Even before 1000 years, the Uttharamerur inscriptions laid down elaborate rules for elections. Lying was a sin that disqualified a person from contest,” says a scholar of archaeology. They list the punishment for a corrupt public servant, including confiscation of his property and excommunication of his dependants, but have no reference to capital punishment.
The Penneshwaramadam temple also has panels of Navagandam, depicting a man holding his tuft by one hand and slicing the neck with a sword by the other.
The practice of progressively chopping off nine parts of one’s own body — which evokes sociologist Emile Durkheim’s category of altruistic suicide — was often committed before Kottravai, the goddess of war, for the welfare of the ruler and success in battles he leads.
The practice is similar to the present day personality cult in Dravidian politics and self-immolation bids and suicides that Tamil Nadu witnessed last week after the conviction of Ms. Jayalalithaa, says Sugavana Murugan, who has written about the inscription in the now-defunct literary journal Vadakku Vaasal, which was published from Delhi.

Farming in a fragmented landscape

Average size of landholding has shrunk to 0.80 hectares during 2010-11
Land available for farming in Tamil Nadu is going down year by year. There seems no end to fragmentation.
According to the latest report of the Department of Evaluation and Applied Research (DEAR) on the State’s economic appraisal for the period from 2011-12 to 2013-14, the average size of landholding has shrunk from 1.45 hectares during 1970-71 to 0.80 hectares during 2010-11.
The report, quoting the last Agricultural Census (2010-11), says the average size of landholding in the State is even lower than the national average, which is 1.16 hectares.
The report states that a combination of factors, such as increasing industrialisation, growing urbanisation and real estate and infrastructure development, has diverted farmland to non-farm use, reducing the area under cultivation.
Marginal and small farmers owning up to two hectares account for 92 per cent of the total number of landholdings. The medium (2-10 hectares) and big (over 10 hectares) farmers possess 8 per cent.
As for area, the share of small and marginal farmers is 61 per cent, whereas the medium and big farmers own 39 per cent. While a marginal farmer holds, on an average, 0.37 hectare, a big farmer owns 20.59 hectares.
The silver lining is that there has been no corresponding fall in grain production. The technological advances and better water management have helped the farmers achieve a fairly reasonable rate of yield: around three tonnes per hectare.
The production was 101.5 lakh tonnes during 2011-12 and 110.65 lakh tonnes during 2013-14. “There is still scope for improvement,” an official says.
In the past 40 years, the share of agriculture in the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) has dropped drastically, from 34.79 per cent to 8.81 per cent. Yet, the farm sector remains the biggest employer, accounting for 45 per cent of employment.
The secondary and tertiary sectors, which now contribute 30.5 and 60.6 per cent to the GSDP, employ 27 per cent of the workforce each.
The report has recommended that the marginal and small farmers be motivated to form farmers’ groups so that they get all technical inputs in time and to ensure judicious use of scarce resources.

We have political will to undertake reform: RajanPTI RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan
TOPICS
economy, business and finance
‘It is a good time to invest in Indian economy’
Underscoring the need for financial sector reforms, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has stressed that the ‘time to deliver begins now’ and there is political will to undertake reforms and improve India’s economic growth.
“Financial reform is not difficult - we have the political will to improve,” the Indian Consulate here tweeted the RBI Governor as saying during an event on Wednesday.
“Time to deliver begins now. We need to focus on deliverables,” another tweet quoting Dr. Rajan said.
The head of India’s central bank addressed a select gathering of prominent and influential Indian-American businessmen from the finance and investment banking sector at an event organised by the Consulate General in collaboration with the India-America Chamber of Commerce.
Outlining the major areas that require change and immediate implementation, Dr. Rajan said it was a good time to invest in the Indian economy now.
Developing infrastructure, improving quality of human capital, optimum regulation for good business and extensive financial sector reform should be the next steps for improvement and development of the Indian economy, according a press statement issued by the Consulate.
Dr. Rajan encouraged the Indian-American business community to get involved in the “nitty-gritty of the implementation process,” saying such involvement was not difficult especially since the Indian government had the political will to reform.
“Over the years, India has outgrown its institutions,” Dr. Rajan was quoted as saying in the statement. “Such institutions only worked well when we had the practice of resource allocation, which was a source of revenue. This was a time when coal could be extracted from the ground with your bare hands.” Dr. Rajan said the Indian economy can no longer work with this model, adding that just as there were drastic democratic changes that reacted to the economic slump in the past decade, institutions also had reacted.
He emphasised on the need to convert talk about change into delivering and implementing reforms, the press statement said.
Making crucial recommendations to creating a more investment-friendly market in India, Dr. Rajan said stalled projects needed to get back on track and “clearance should be from capital and on ground.”

Bhuvneshwar  Indias subtle knifeUpdated: October 10, 2014 00:02 IST
Bhuvneshwar — India’s subtle knife
Arun Venugopal
AP UTILITY PLAYER: With his prodigious swing and courageous lower middle-order batting, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has become a key component of the Indian team.
TOPICS
cricket
If, like in football, ‘assists’ were recorded for performances in cricket, Bhuvneshwar Kumar would have more to show for than 10-1-38-0 — his stats from the first ODI that obscure more than they reveal.
If someone who has never watched him bowl were to deduce his efficacy from numbers alone, the easiest finding would be of him being a ‘holding’ bowler who ‘keeps it tight’.
Much more
While it’s true that he’s niggardly — his economy-rate in ODIs and T20s are 4.67 and 6.22 respectively — Bhuvneshwar is much more than just that.
Against Dwayne Smith and Dwayne Bravo, for instance, in the aforementioned match, he went all out to ensnare them, pursuing a plan to its logical conclusion. Right from his first ball, he kept banging out a length on the middle-and-off stumps and got it to curve away, viciously and ever so regularly. It’s the kind of stuff that forms the cornerstone of the Glenn McGrath seam-bowling manual.
That prissy accuracy, backed up by genuine swing, got both openers swishing and missing more often than not.
Bravo, evidently restless at not feeling bat on ball while Bhuvneshwar was operating, took his chances against Mohammed Shami, and as it so often happens, was consumed by him. The scorecard wouldn’t show that, but that was a clear assist for Bhuvneshwar.
Since his limited-overs debut in late 2012 against Pakistan, Bhuvneshwar has been India’s comfort food. His wristy, prodigious swing — regardless of the conditions — and courageous lower middle-order batting have come to be seen as a matter of fact: for colleagues and fans alike, it’s a given he would deliver, and even when he doesn’t, he doesn’t fail spectacularly.
At 24, he has already acquired the reputation of being a bankable cricketer. It also helps he doesn’t indulge in trash-talking on or off the field. Suresh Raina, his captain at Uttar Pradesh, rates his work-ethic very highly.
Eager to learn
“He should be a key member of the team in times to come,” Raina had said two years ago. “The best part about him is his attitude. He is a disciplined guy and is always eager to learn.”
India skipper M.S. Dhoni knows all too well that Bhuvneshwar is one of the few cricketers he needn’t spend time worrying about.
“He knows his limitations really well, and that’s why he has been quite consistent. He mixes it up well. If there is some assistance [from the wicket], he is someone who makes sure he gets that,” said Dhoni after the match, adding that he was looking at deploying him at the back-end too.
“When the ball is swinging well, we’re looking to get wickets off his bowling. We have not used too much of him in the slog, but that’s something we’d like to do”.
Sometime ago, Uttar Pradesh coach Venkatesh Prasad had lauded Bhuvneshwar’s smartness. “He adapts quickly. One doesn’t need to tell him too much. Not only is he aware of his responsibilities, but also he is quick to put plans into action.”
Glimpse of alacrity
Bhuvneshwar offered a glimpse of such alacrity while bowling at Smith on Wednesday. Realising that Smith’s forceful punts against his out-swingers were paying off, he switched to in-swing, and had a long-on in place factoring the batsman’s adventurousness. While the ploy didn’t work, it certainly reflected an alert brain at work.
In less than two years, the wiry lad from Meerut has become a key component of the Indian team.
Much will be expected of Bhuvneshwar at the World Cup next year, but given his equanimity, it’s safe to assume that the enormity of the occasion wouldn’t daunt him.

Harsh words replaced crossfire at the Line of Control and the International Border, which went silent for the first time in two weeks.
Sources confirmed to The Hindu that diplomatic initiatives between India and Pakistan have brought the situation under control for the moment.
The External Affairs Ministry issued its first public statement on the crisis, calling on Pakistan to “restore peace and tranquillity.” “It is for Pakistan to escalate or de-escalate. Pakistan and its security forces need to end adventurism along the border and LoC,” spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said. Government sources told The Hindu that diplomats in New Delhi and Islamabad had been in close contact for the past few days.
PM’s tough talk
At a rally in Maharashtra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his toughest statement against Pakistan’s aggression at the border yet, saying, “Indian jawans have shut Pakistan’s mouth.”
In Islamabad, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif chaired a National Security Council meeting, including the service chiefs. Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed India for “unprovoked violations” of the ceasefire, but said “war is not an option.”

The two struggled against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.
Kailash Satyarthi, 60-year-old child rights activist from Madhya Pradesh, and Malala Yousafzai, who has risked her life to wage a campaign for girls’ education in Pakistan, are the joint winners of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize.
“It is an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday. They were chosen for the prize for “their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.”
The Committee said Mr. Satyarthi, based in New Delhi, showed “great personal courage” and “maintaining Gandhi’s tradition, has headed various forms of protests and demonstrations, all peaceful, focusing on the grave exploitation of children for financial gain.”
The peace prize winner has saved thousands of children from bonded labour in factories through the Bachpan Bachao Andolan which he founded in 1980, and other organisations. On Malala Yousafzai, the Committee said, “Despite her youth, [she] has already fought for several years for the rights of girls to education, and has shown by example that children and young people, too, can contribute to improving their own situations.” Malala became a global symbol of the fight against extremism after she was shot by Taliban militants two years ago in Swat.

ATM
(RBI said the number of free…)
MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank today said the number of free transactions in a month at non-home ATMs would remain three in six identified metros but customers of these centres can use their card without cost two more times in non-metro centres.
"As per the latest instruction, while this overall cap (five free ATM transactions) remains unchanged, three transactions, inclusive of both financial and non-financial, would be free of charge if carried out at other bank ATMs located in six metro centres," the RBI notification said.
"Accordingly, if transactions are carried out at both six metro centres and other locations, the total number of free- of-charge transactions at other bank ATMs would continue to remain five," it said.
The RBI in August had said that the number of free ATM transactions for savings bank account customers at other banks' ATMs would be reduced from the present 5 to 3 transactions per month (inclusive of both financial and non-financial transactions) for transactions done at the ATMs located in 6 metro centres.
A customer will be required to pay a fee of up to Rs 20 for using Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) beyond the permitted numbers of transactions in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata and Hyderabad, it had said.
The RBI's latest directive would be applicable from November 1, 2014.
However, the RBI said that banks are free to offer more number of free transactions per month at other bank ATMs as well as their own ATMs in any geographical location if they desire so.
Banks are also free to decide on the combination for metro and non-metro locations of free transactions while adhering to minimum requirements, the RBI notification said.

We want to be a bellwether again; will get into 18% growth in long term: Vishal Sikka  Infosysacquisitions
(It is too early to forecast…)
Vishal Sikka's first earnings presentation as Infosys CEO was centred on the themes of automation, artificial intelligence and 'design thinking,' the latter phrase that describes a creative, user-centred approach to problem-solving. Sikka also addressed questions on some long-standing issues and investor concerns. Excerpts:
On Automation And Artificial Intelligence
I want to make a big mention of automation. Artificial intelligence as a domain is not very well understood. It is often associated with precipitating... the irrelevance of humanity. Having studied at Stanford and other places at the feet of the pioneers of this domain, I see the word fundamentally differently.
Technology has always been about the amplification of the human be ing. About augmenting them with new capabilities, not about making them irrelevant.
On Design Thinking
We are starting Design Thinking training in a massive way . We have already done sessions for many of our leaders, for example in consulting and our sales leadership, together with Stanford University's d.school (design school). We are putting together a very large design thinking training session for all Infosys employees at Mysore as well as our development centres. This will help us train tens of thousands of Infosys employees on Design Thinking over the next few months.
On Target Margins
It is too early to forecast that, but based on the strategy that I have articulated, we should be able to get into 15-18% growth in the long term, and 25-28% margins. I see no reason why, over a long term, we couldn't achieve such numbers.
On Acquisitions
The key idea is to not acquire yesterday's products and services companies, but to acquire capabilities and skills of tomorrow that help us grow in areas that are strategic to us.Beyond the technology and the skills, we also want to use the inorganic strategy to get into some other penetrative but high-growth areas, and some geographies, where acquisitions can help us achieve our objectives faster.
On Working With Startups
Infosys can enable startups to attain great engineering speed, scale and global reach by helping them amplify their development at the right moment, combined with joint go-tomarket where we can help bring startups to our clients. Strategic investment from our $100-million venture fund, to help bring Infosys into close collaboration with today's startups, will lead to great companies of the future.
On Sales Team
We do see meaningful changes on the sales front. Our sales team is actively engaged in renewing its own capabilities through both reskilling and retraining, and bringing in new talent. We have already done Design Thinking training sessions with our sales players.
On Finacle
Our Finacle business did not have such a great quarter, and posted a 5.4% decline in quarter-on-quarter revenue. We just announced a leadership change for this unit, and we will be executing plans on several dimensions to return this business to growth and success.
On Renewing Business Lines
When we think about renewing the landscape, we believe that everyone, in every business, in every industry, needs to renew their existing systems and processes, and for Infosys this means a renewal of our existing business lines.
On Offering Next Gen Services
Every service that we offer today will be renewed on the basis of innovation, automation and improvements in process efficiency . As such there is no old or new service. It is simply an old way or a new way of doing the same services. In addition to renewing the services that we have today , we believe that there is an additional need for new kinds of technology such as new kinds of platforms for new data, machine learning, big data and so forth.

Chinese companies have evinced interest in investing in rail infrastructure projects in India, including mass transportation projects in two cities in the State.
The rolling stock manufacturer Changchun Railway Vehicle Co Ltd. (CNR), which had bid for the monorail project in Chennai, on Friday officially expressed its readiness to participate in the proposed light metro for Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode.
A three-member team from the company was in Thiruvananthapuram to see the topography and visit the alignment fixed for the light metro.
Officials of the infrastructure development firm IL&FS Transportation Networks, which is working out a partnership with the Chinese firm, met officials of Kerala Monorail Corporation Ltd. (KMCL), set up to execute the project, and informed them of its interest in participating in the project if it is in the PPP mode. An official of the KMCL told The Hindu that the officials were asked to give their preference in writing so that it could be communicated to the government.
The visit assumes significance as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), general consultant for the project, has submitted the detailed project report for the light metro in place of the scrapped MRTS. The team visited the road corridors developed under the City Road Improvement Project by the IL&FS. The elevated light metro has been proposed mainly through these corridors in the capital by the DMRC.
ITNL International Private Ltd., a subsidiary of IL&FS Transportation Networks, has acquired 49 per cent equity in Chongqing Expressway Group that is constructing the YuHe Expressway.

TOPICS
Sukrutham, the State government’s project to provide free cancer treatment to people through government hospitals, will become a reality in the State on November 1.
The scheme was dedicated to the people by actor Mammootty at a function here on Friday.
In his inaugural address, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said 35 lakh families enrolled in the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) comprehensive health insurance scheme would benefit from the scheme in the first phase. In the next phase, the government intended to extend the scheme to all families in the State. Free education for cancer-afflicted children in the State was in the offing, Mr. Chandy said.
Funding for scheme
He said various options were being looked at to raise funds for Sukrutham, which would incur an estimated expense of Rs.320 crore every year. The revenue generated through the 8 per cent increased taxation on cigarettes and the 1 per cent tax hike on liquor would be set aside for the cancer care scheme.
Mr. Chandy said the government had decided to withdraw the proposed hike in user fee for various services under the Health Department.
Call to change lifestyle
Mr. Mammootty, in his address, appealed to the people to go back to their roots and traditional lifestyle to ward off scourges such as cancer. The accent should be on prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases through a healthy lifestyle and proper diet, he said.
“We never had the threat of cancers or such diseases when we were eating our traditional diet. We should go back to farming, and start growing our own food in our backyards,” Mr. Mammootty said.
Plastic should never be used for storing food and water, he felt.
Several members of the Cabinet, including Ramesh Chennithala, V.S. Sivakumar, P.K. Abdu Rabb, Shibu Baby John, K.P. Mohanan, and senior Health officials were present on the occasion.

Sunanda s death due to poisoning  says post-mortem reportPrint
New Delhi, Oct 9 (IANS) The controversy over the death of Sunanda Pushkar, wife of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, took a new turn Thursday with the leak of her latest post mortem report, submitted to AIIMS, stating the cause of death as "poisoning".
The revelation came around ten days after the post mortem report of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) was submitted to the Delhi Police by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).
Pushkar, 52, was found dead in a mysterious condition in her room at a five-star hotel in south Delhi Jan 17.
The leaked report said that the AIIMS medical board "had thoroughly pursued the various documents that were submitted to them by the investigating officers along with the post mortem report and histopathology report of viscera after which it was concluded the cause of Pushkar's death is poisoning".
"Viscera are positive for ethyl alcohol, caffeine, acetaminophen and cotinine," it said.
The report also revealed that the medical report reserved comment on the specific poison or chemical responsible since there was a lot of limitations on the viscera report.
"The duration of injuries have been opined already. However, the reason of these physical injuries, circumstantial evidences and statements have not been submitted by the investigative officer," the report states.
Speaking on the matter Delhi Police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat told IANS: "Under section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the inquest proceeding in the Sundanda Pushkar case is still pending and we didn't add anything in it."

Pakistan will not dare to repeat border aggression: Modi“This is not the time for bayan bazi (commenting) but jawan ki goli (the jawan’s bullet),” the Prime Minister said at an election rally in Amravati, Maharashtra, on Friday. PTI

India-Pakistan
He promised compensation to villagers who fled their homes and suffered losses due to the firing along the international border.
Using firm words over the border ceasefire violations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said Indian soldiers had given Pakistan a "fitting reply" and the neighbouring country would no longer dare repeat its aggression.
Praising the Indian jawans, Mr. Modi said Pakistan had been “silenced.”
The PM also promised compensation to those villagers who were forced to flee their homes and suffered losses due to the firing along the international border.
"Pakistan ko muh ki khaani padi hai (Pakistan has got a fitting reply). They won’t dare try this again. Pakistan has got its response, the response has silenced them,” he said at a rally in Amravati.
Assuring the victims of Pakistan shelling, Mr. Modi said the government would take urgent steps to compensate them.
Political opponents, including Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, had questioned Mr. Modi on his "silence" on the border turmoil even as he addressed multiple rallies in Maharashtra, which goes to the polls on October 15.
“It’s easier to talk than to act,” Mr. Gandhi had said.
Taking on the Congress, Mr. Modi said the party was merely indulging in “commenting” over the situation on the border. “This is not the time for bayan bazi (commenting) but jawan ki goli (the jawan’s bullet).”
Speaking with a sore throat, Mr. Modi addressed his scheduled four rallies in the day but had to cut down on content. In Brahmapuri, in Maoist-infested Chandrapur district, Mr. Modi appealed to the youth to shun violence and take to farming. “Instead of soaking the soil with human blood), you can take up the plough and make it green,” he said.
Raking up the development work done across the State border in Chhattisgarh, which has a BJP Government and is also Maoist affected, Mr. Modi asked: “Chhattisgarh (then part of Madhya Pradesh) was a BIMARU State till yesterday. But today, it finds recognition for paddy cultivation. What are the reasons that farmers in Maharashtra, in regions abutting Chhattisgarh, are still struggling for survival?
In Dhamangaon, Mr. Modi addressed the interests of cotton farmers and said to resolve their woes, the government had devised a "5F" formula: from farm to fibre, to factory, to fashion, to foreign.

Denied bail by the Karnataka High Court following her conviction in the wealth case, she had moved the Supreme Court for bail on Thursday.
Jailed former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa’s plea for bail in the disproportionate wealth case is likely to come up for hearing in the Supreme Court on Monday.
Lawyers associated with her case said some procedural aspect for mentioning it for urgent hearing was yet to be completed and the apex court registry is likely to put it in the mentioning list of October 13.
Jayalalithaa, who was denied bail by the Karnataka High Court following her conviction in the case, had on Thursday moved the Supreme Court for bail.
The AIADMK chief, who has been behind bars for the last 12 days, challenged the High Court order which had refused her bail.
Jayalalithaa has pleaded that she has been sentenced to only four years' jail in the case and she is suffering from various ailments, as grounds for her immediate relief.
She said as Chief Minister she did not misuse her powers in this case.
The former Chief Minister also cited grounds of being a senior citizen and a woman for getting out of jail.
The 66—year—old veteran politician was denied bail by the High Court on October 7 despite the Special Public Prosecutor not objecting to grant of conditional bail to her.
In her petitions seeking immediate bail, Jayalalithaa maintained that the charge of amassing wealth against her during 1991—96 when she was the Chief Minister for the first time was false and that she had acquired property through legal means.
She also contended that the trial court had overlooked several judgments and not considered the binding nature of various income tax orders and decisions of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which had accepted the income and the level of expenditure pleaded by her.
The High Court judge had said that there “are no grounds” to give bail to Jayalalithaa. Corruption amounts to “violation of human rights” and leads to economic imbalance,
The HC also rejected the bail pleas by Jayalalithaa’s close aide Sasikala and her relatives V N Sudhakaran, disowned foster—son of the former Chief Minister, and Ilavarasi, who have also been sent to four years in jail in the 18—year—old case.
The Special Court had held Jayalalithaa and three others guilty of corruption. The court had also slapped a fine of Rs. 100 crore on the AIADMK chief and Rs 10. crore on each of the three other convicts.

Nobel Prize: My father was unperturbed  says Satyarthi s daughter | OpinionMy father was unperturbed, says Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi's daughter

(He is a soft-spoken Gandhian…)
By Asmita
I rushed to meet my father at his office as soon as I heard the news about him winning the Nobel Peace Prize. He didn't seem to be as excited as I was. "Gandhiji should have won it before me." Those were his first words to me.
He is a soft-spoken Gandhian on normal days. Today, he was also unperturbed. I saw him for 15 minutes after the announcement, before the media took over.
My father has, over the years been involved with a host of social issues, from anti-smoking campaigns to his most important work through his NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan , which has helped free and rehabilitate several thousand children from child labour. He is also a big animal lover, calling our dog "our third child".
His work with Bachpan Bachao Andolan, however, has not always been smooth. In their attempt to rescue
children, his team and he have often run into trouble with child traffickers and employers who have threatened and inflicted violence.
He has been attacked several times and threats over the phone at home were not uncommon. I had to go to study in the US because of this. We would get threats at home about me, stuff like that. But he has always been a great father. Despite the threats, we have always supported and understood his wish to reach out and improve the lives of children. My mother, Sumedha Kailash, and elder brother Bhuvan Ribhu, also actively work with my father's NGO.
When he decided to quit his teaching job at a college in Vidisha, my mother's family was very unhappy. They were not too happy anyway, because they had eloped and married. His decision to quit gave my maternal parents another reason to disown my mother. But my mother supported him through very difficult times.
The family has had no time to sit together yet and have a conversation about my father winning the Nobel Prize . I haven't really discussed it with him, but it's a proud moment. Given the recent border violence with Pakistan, it's a great statement for peace, for India and Pakistan.
Some of my father's friends had nominated him earlier for the award. But because the Nobel Peace Prize committee is really secretive, nobody had much idea what was happening. This year it was a complete and total shocker.

Akhilesh Yadav: BJP giving religious colour to Ganga cleaningThe Hindu Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
TOPICS
national politics
The three-day national convention of the Samajwadi Party concluded here on Friday with the party reinforcing its anti-BJP stand as well as the SP’s socialist and secular agenda. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav slammed the BJP’s attempts to give a religious colour to the cleaning of rivers. Describing the rivers as “socialist and secular”, Mr. Yadav said cleaning the Ganga alone and leaving the other rivers will not help.
“Don’t forget to continue struggle against injustice, atrocities and inequality, mistrust between communities has to be removed,” Mr. Mulayam Singh said as he brought the curtains down on the ninth national convention of his party at the Janeshwar Mishra Park on Friday. Lucknow, the birthplace of Samajwadi Party, hosted the national convention after a gap of about 22 years --- the last meet here was held on November 12, 1992 when the party was born.
Aware that a generational change had taken place in 22 years, Mr. Singh exhorted the youth to shoulder responsibility of taking the party forward on the strength of its policies and programmes. They were also reminded of the long struggle waged by him and other leaders which had enabled the Samajwadi Party to attain its present status.
The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister , who was present on all the three days of the convention spoke only in the concluding session on Friday. In fact, Mr. Yadav and the SP chief were the only two speakers on the last day. In a reference to the BJP, Mr. Yadav said a communal agenda is being promoted by some forces and pointed towards the dual challenge posed to the Samajwadi Party from the capitalist forces and the communal agenda. “Be prepared to take on the dual challenge”, the Chief Minister said.
Stating that some parties were not implementing their poll manifesto, Mr. Yadav lampooned the BJP’s agenda of cleaning the rivers and accused it of giving religious connotations to the task. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister blamed the Centre for the power crisis in the State. Taking a swipe at the BJP, Mr. Yadav said the people of the State had elected 71 MPs of the party, “but what have they done for the State”. He asked the workers to take a resolve for returning to power in 2017.
Note of caution
Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh ringing a word of caution against the possibility of “some forces” trying to seek political mileage from the firing on India’s border by the Pakistani army. Making an impassioned plea to preserve brotherhood and amity - the cornerstone of Samajwadi Party’s policies - Mr. Singh, who is now also being looked upon as party patriarch, said there is a conspiracy to disrupt communal harmony. Even as the Samajwadi Party chief cautioned against the threat to disturb communal harmony, in a significant political posturing towards the Backward Castes, Mr. Singh supported the demands of those Backward Castes, which have been denied Mandal Commission benefits. These are mostly Most Backward Castes (MBCs). Telling the deprived BCs not to be disappointed, Mr. Singh said he would talk to the Centre, and added that the initiative will have to be taken by the State Governments, also.
Mr. Singh’s stand on the issue assumes significance in the backdrop of Janata Dal (United) president, Sharad Yadav’s presence on the opening day of the national convention and the possibility of a political realignment of the Backward Castes.

Workshop to boost tourism-based activities in Uttarakhand concludes
In an initiative to develop the 42 sq. km Tehri dam as a destination for adventure tourism, the State government conducted a two-day workshop that concluded on Friday.
This was an important step to boost tourism-based activities in the State and increase employment opportunities for the locals of Tehri, State Tourism Minister Dinesh Dhanai said.
The initiative came as a response to the demands of the locals and other agencies.
Speaking during the workshop on Friday, Chief Minister Harish Rawat said the reservoir would be named ‘Sri Dev Suman Sagar’, after a freedom fighter from Tehri.
All the tourism activities developed around the Tehri dam are to be named after the villages that got submerged in the reservoir, Mr. Rawat said.
Mr. Dhanai said the development of the area as a tourism destination would provide employment opportunities to the locals and would stop migration from Tehri.
The workshop, where various adventure sports activities were performed, was attended by travel agencies and tour operators from across the country.

Hudhud: Odisha deploys NDRF  to evacuate 3.5LAndhra Pradesh
(With the meteorological…)
BHUBANESWAR: With the meteorological department issuing warning on the "very severe cyclonic storm" set to hit the coast near Visakhapatnam on Sunday, Odisha government today deployed NDRF and ODRF to evacuate around 3.5 lakh people.
As the cyclonic storm Hudhud is all set to cross north Andhra Pradesh near Vishakhapatanam, Odisha government deployed 25 units - (each comprising 40 personnel), 15 of NDRF and 10 of ODRF besides fire service men in vulnerable places in different parts of the state.
The IMD has issued Orange Message on the impending storm. "As southern region is likely to be more affected by wind, heavy rainfall and consequent floods, collectors of eight districts of Malkangiri, Koraput, Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Gajapati, Ganjam, Kalahandi and Kandhamal, have been asked to carefully assess and evacuate all vulnerable population to safe buildings," Chief Secretary G C Pati told reporters.
As cyclone and flood situation are new for the tribal population in these districts, the administration have been facing difficulty to convince the people for evacuation.
"We have engaged public announcement system and local community leaders to ensure that all the people living in kutcha houses are taken to safe places by tomorrow forenoon," Pati said.
"We have asked the collectors that no one should remain inside 'kutcha houses' in Malkangiri district. All the people living in 'kutcha' houses need to be evacuated to safe place," Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) P K Mohapatra said, adding this was being done keeping the state's commitment of "zero casualty" as target.
Sources said about 3 lakh to 3.5 lakh people including those living in the coast of Ganjam would be evacuated.
The SRC also asked the district authorities to start free kitchen where evacuation is undertaken. The districts are also told to stock adequate quantity of dryfood, he said.
Though the state government was expecting that the maximum wind speed in the areas adjoining Andhra Pradesh would remain within 100 kmph, it feared that heavy rainfall could create problem for the people. "The rainfall could be in the range of 10 cm to 25 cm within a span of only 36 hours from tomorrow afternoon," said Mohapatra.
He said besides the eight identified districts, many other places would also receive rainfall from tomorrow afternoon till Monday afternoon as per the IMD prediction.
Preparations were made to deal with possible flood in rivers like Rushikulya, Bamsadhara and Nagavali due to heavy rains that would accompany the cyclone.
As a precautionary measure 35 trains passing through the east coast would be cancelled while several others diverted, East Coast Railway (ECoR) said in a release here.

Ebola cases doubling every 3-4 weeks: UN envoyAfrica
(He said the United Nations,…)
UNITED NATIONS: The UN special envoy on Ebola said Friday the number of cases is probably doubling every three-to-four weeks and the response needs to be 20 times greater than it was at the beginning of October to control the rapid advance of the deadly virus.
David Nabarro warned the UN General Assembly that without the mass mobilization of virtually every country, all donor organizations and many non-governmental groups to support the affected countries in West Africa , "it will be impossible to get this disease quickly under control, and the world will have to live with the Ebola virus forever."
Nabarro said in his 35 years as a public health doctor dealing with many disease outbreaks and some pandemics he has never encountered a challenge like Ebola because the outbreak has moved from rural areas into towns and cities and is now "affecting a whole region and ... impacting on the whole world."
He said the United Nations , which is coordinating the global response, knows what needs to be done to catch up to and overtake Ebola's rapid advance, "and together we're going to do it."
"And our commitment to all of you is to achieve it within a matter of months _ a few months," Nabarro told diplomats from most of the 193 UN member states.
UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson stressed that catching up with "the menacing exponential curve of the virus" demands not only a mobilization inside and outside the affected countries and "a global response in compassion and solidarity," but a massive scale-up of financial resources, medical staff and equipment.
He lamented that only one-quarter of the $1 billion that UN agencies have appealed for to tackle Ebola has been funded.
"I now appeal to all member states to act generously and swiftly," Eliasson said. "Speed is of the essence. A contribution within days is more important than a larger contribution within weeks."

Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg meets PM Narendra Modi & IT minister, agrees to partner govt in NOFN project

(Zuckerberg, 30, was on a…)
NEW DELHI: India could be the first country in which Facebook deploys drones to provide broadband connectivity in remote and inaccessible areas, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg proposing a pilot project to bridge this digital divide during his meeting with communications and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday.
According to people familiar with the discussions, the minister sought Facebook as a partner in the National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN) programme, which aims to connect 2.5 lakh village panchayats through high-speed broadband by 2017. "Zuckerberg readily agreed," one of the persons told ET.
He proposed that Facebook could contribute to India's Rs 21,000-crore NOFN project on last-mile connectivity. He spoke of alternate technology such as drones and satellite communications playing a critical part in this last-mile linkage.
"He said the company was keen on testing the pilot project in a few states in India, especially Seemandhra, given the state's emphasis on technology," the person added.
Facebook's Connectivity Lab is actively developing large, inexpensive, solar-powered drones that will be able to fly for years at a time, the division's engineering director Yael Maguire announced earlier this year. These unmanned vehicles will be about the size of a Boeing 747 but weigh only as much as four car tyres while serving as large connectivity hubs.
Keen on India Initiatives
At the Delhi meeting on Friday, Facebook also expressed its willingness to set up a server in India to handle the data transmitted through the drones and other alternative technology and comply with the government's security requirements, according to another person who spoke to ET.
According to people at the hour-long meeting, which included officials of the telecom department and the company, the usually shy billionaire was very forthcoming, listing a number of initiatives in which the Facebook wanted to partner with the Indian government such as e-health, education, providing free basic services and alternative technologies. Facebook didn't respond to ET's request for comment.
Under the government's ambitious Digital India initiative, the government plans use the NOFN project to deliver e-services in areas such as health, education etc to every nook and corner of the country.
However, reaching the end consumer--homes, schools, hospitals and other institutions-—may require wireless technology, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. This is where Facebook senses an opportunity to use its yet-to-be-developed drones.
  Facebook also sought the nomination of senior ministry officials it could liaise with on such projects, to which the minister immediately agreed. "We have dedicated some officials from my ministry to work closely with Facebook on their proposals to expand digital services in the country," Prasad said.
Two joint secretaries - one each from telecom and IT - will be the single-point contacts for the social networking giant, especially on modalities related to the alternate technology, including drones, that Facebook proposes to deploy in India, subject to security clearances.
To be sure, while the Indian government is keen on Facebook's participation in promoting local entrepreneurship and developing localised content for the Digital India programme, it remains to be seen whether it will allow unmanned drones to operate in the country.
The Mumbai police recently raised objections when a food outlet used a four-rotor drone to deliver pizza. Such airborne devices could face questions from the aviation regulator apart from any misgivings the security establishment may have.
Zuckerberg, 30, was on a two-day visit to India, during which he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prasad, besides industry leaders. He also delivered the keynote address at the internet.
org summit. The notfor-profit internet.org partnership was set up last year by Facebook along with mobile phone technology providers Samsung, Mediatek, Qualcomm, Nokia, Opera Software and Ericsson.
It's aimed at providing affordable internet access across the globe. Addressing the summit in the capital on Thursday, Zuckergberg had said that more than 1 billion people in India didn't have access to the Net and that he would discuss this with Modi.
The drones that Facebook is developing would fly at a height of 60,000 to 90,000 feet above the ground, far above commercial jetliners and at a level where they wouldn't be affected by the weather, effectively making them invisible.
In order to continuously provide Wi-Fi coverage, they would be powered by the sun, Maguire had said, adding that these could be tested in the US as early as next year.
Search engine giant Google is another tech firm looking at ways of providing internet access through drones and balloons. In April, Google outbid Facebook for US dronemaker Titan Aerospace. Facebook subsequently acquired UK-based drone company Ascenta for $20 m.

Just in: Infosys Q2 net profit up 28.6%; beats forecastsEmployees walk in front of a building dubbed the "washing machine", a well-known landmark built by Infosys at the Electronics City IT district in Bangalore, February 28, 2012. REUTERS/Vivek Prakash/Files
By Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Anya George Tharakan
BANGALORE (Reuters) - Infosys Ltd(INFY.NS) wants to revive growth through automation and artificial intelligence, its chief executive said on Friday, boosting investors' confidence in India's second largest IT exporter after it posted a forecast-beating quarterly profit.
Chief Executive Vishal Sikka was brought in earlier this year to chart a new strategy for Infosys, once a trendsetter for India's more than $100 billion IT outsourcing industry but which has struggled in recent years to retain staff and market share.
Infosys often appeared torn between chasing high-margin projects and low-margin bread-and-butter IT deals. Sikka, however, said Infosys' future now lay in new technologies, and that it would look into acquisitions to expand into those areas.
"We believe we can get back to that consistent profitable growth as well as achieve great growth and once again become a bellwether of the Indian IT industry," Sikka told reporters at the company's sprawling Bangalore headquarters.
"Each of our services will be renewed on the basis on innovation, on the basis new technologies like automation, artificial intelligence-based technologies ... there can be a next generation services company that we can transform into."
Investors cheered Sikka's plans, helping to send Infosys stock up by as much as 7.1 percent on Friday in Mumbai, outpacing the benchmark BSE Sensex which was down nearly 1 percent.
The stock is also on track to post its biggest single day gain in more than a year after Infosys posted a higher-than-expected 28.6 percent rise in its second-quarter net profit and unexpectedly announced it was issuing bonus shares and an interim dividend.
"This is exactly the kind of technology leadership we had been saying Infosys needs. We had anticipated a confident Infosys under him and that seems to be coming through," said Ravi Menon, associate vice president at Centrum Broking Ltd.
The shift into artificial intelligence and automation would be a leap for Infosys, which currently offers services that include remotely managing computer networks and writing software code.
Infosys has not done a large acquisition since it was founded in 1981 by seven engineers who pooled $250. The company has cash and cash equivalents of about $5.4 billion at the end of September, its earnings statement shows.
Tech firms including Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have pursued artificial intelligence to analyse the data and improve computers' ability to recognize faces, objects or learn languages.
STAFF EXITS
Infosys, which makes more than two-thirds of its sales from clients in the United States and Europe, said net profit in the quarter ended September rose to 30.96 billion rupees ($506.25 million) from 24.07 billion rupees in the same year-ago period.
Analysts, on average, were expecting to post a 29.20 billion rupees quarterly profit, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company maintained its forecast of 7-9 percent sales growth for the year ending in March 2015, meeting analyst expectations.
Revenue during the quarter rose 2.9 percent to 133.42 billion rupees ($2.18 billion).
Infosys provides IT services to western clients including BT Group, Bank of America and Volkswagen. The company added 49 new clients during the September quarter, including a multi-year contract with Daimler AG.
Annualised staff attrition rate at Infosys rose to a record 20.1 percent in the September quarter. Chief Operating Officer UB Pravin Rao said this would come down in the next couple of quarters to 13-15 percent, which is the industry average.
"If Sikka is able to retain employees and use some of the cash for an acquisition, investor confidence in him and the company will go up significantly," said RK Gupta, managing director of Taurus Asset Management, which owns Infosys shares.
"I really think he will be able to deliver."

Ask Matt: Is AAPL worth $100 a shareAP
Q: Is Apple really worth $200 a share?
A: If you think Apple’s (AAPL) stock should be trading at double its current level, it’s time to get your iWatch checked. That’s what analysts are saying.
Billionaire Carl Icahn sent a letter to Apple’s management Thursday, stating that the stock is worth $200. That’s caught many investors off guard since that would be double the stock’s $101.02 a share closing price on Thursday.
But Icahn’s price target is nowhere near what Wall Street analysts say the stock is worth. The average 18-month price target on the stock is $111.73 a share. The difference between what analysts say the stock is worth and what Icahn says it’s worth is roughly $500 billion.
Analysts like Jim Kelleher of Argus Research say  Icahn, who owns about 1% of Apple stock, is basing his forecast on overly optimistic projections. Apple would need to generate gross margins, or what it keeps from revenue after paying direct costs, that are much greater than at any time in the company’s history to even get close to justifying Icahn’s forecast. Additionally, Apple would need to maintain 12% annual revenue growth each and every of the next three years. That’s an aggressive call that analysts don’t think is likely. As an owner of Apple stock, Icahn has an incentive to see it move higher.

Why the market funkIs market funk based on fear or fundamentals?

The stock market is in a downward spiral and going through its most volatile period in three years, begging the question: Is the swoon based on fear or fast-fading business fundamentals?
The coming third-quarter earnings season and what CEOs say about the global economy and the outlook could help answer the question.
There’s no doubt that the Dow Jones industrial average’s most violent run of price swings since August 2011 has upped the angst level of U.S. investors. A trio of wild days, with the Dow down 273 Tuesday, up 275 Wednesday and down 335 Thursday has caused a spike in a closely watched Wall Street fear gauge, dubbed the VIX. Yesterday, the fear gauge jumped more than 24%.
And that raises the question as to whether the selloff is a short-term phenomenon caused by jittery investors selling first and asking questions later, or whether it is telegraphing tougher times ahead for the global economy — and U.S. growth.
There’s no doubt growth in the eurozone is sub par, and possibly getting worse. Or that Germany, the one-time locomotive of the eurozone, has flashed a spate of weaker-than-expected data points recently, ranging from weak factory orders to a slowdown in industrial production, due in part to the Russia – Ukraine crisis and economic sanctions levied against Moscow. China, while still growing at a 7% plus rate is slowing nonetheless, as well.
All this bad news comes at a time when the U.S. central bank is nearing the end of its market-friendly and growth-friendly  bond-buying program at the end of the month and eyeing its first interest rate hike since 2006 sometime next year.
The U.S., however, has been a bright spot amid darkening clouds abroad. The U.S., of course, clocked in at a 4.6% growth rate in the second quarter.
The question facing investors is whether or not the economic troubles abroad will take the U.S. down with it, and hurt U.S. corporate profitability.
For now, investors don’t know the answer. Bur they could get a better feel for the potential damage when the third-quarter earnings season ramps up in coming weeks and corporate CEOs share their outlook for coming months and quarters.
Right now, investors are confused.
“Investors need to hear from companies with regard to demand for their goods and services,” says Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Ultimately, this should be the best indicator of the depth of the global slowdown.”
Adds Krosby: “With the Federal Reserve ending Treasury and mortgage bond purchases, expect the market to focus on corporate earnings, especially top-line revenue growth and guidance, now more than ever. The market is poised to enter a period of discovery: how much of the ride up was due to the massive bond-buying program versus fundamentals.”
While fears of a global slowdown are not all made up, not all slowdowns have to end up in big, bad recessions or bear markets, adds Alan Skrainka, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth Management.
“The selloff is being fueled by fears that the global economy is slowing down. Europe is barely growing, and China has slowed down considerably,” says Skrainka. “The market was overdue for a correction.  Not every correction develops into a bear market. Every economic slowdown is not a recession. Look for opportunities and maintain a long-term perspective.”
 

Nasdaq takes a poundingWhy the Nasdaq is still getting hammered

The Nasdaq got hammered hard again Friday — making it the disproportionately large victim of the market’s selloff which worsened across the board.
Following a colossal 2%, 90.25-point smackdown in the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index Thursday, Friday is another horrific day for the ‘Naz. The Nasdaq crumbled another 102.10 points, or 2.3%, to 4276.24 Friday.
Friday’s tumble caps off a 4.5% decline for the week, the Nasdaq’s worst week since May 2012. And it’s a stunningly bad performance even while the rest of the market is falling. The Standard & Poor’s 500, in contrast, fell 1.2% Friday.
What’s wrong with the Nasdaq? On Friday, it was simple. Computer semiconductor stocks got hammered. Six of the 10 worst-performing Nasdaq 100 stocks Friday are all computer chip-related companies. The Nasdaq 100 is a collection of the most valuable non-financial stocks in the Nasdaq, therefore the stocks with the most sway on the index’ value.
Friday biggest Nasdaq loser on a percentage basis was NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) , which designs all sorts of computer chips. The stock fell $8, or 12.4%, to $56.34.
Chip stocks were the biggest culprits Friday, but not the only ones. Another top-10 Nasdaq loser of the day, which isn’t a computer chipmaking stock, is electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) . Shares fell $20.10, or 7.8%, to $236.01 after the company didn’t announce the mind-blowing self-driving car some investors had hoped for.
Below are the worst performing Nasdaq 100 stocks today on a percentage basis:

Slovakia stun Spain in Euro 2016 qualifierSpain beaten as Stoch earns dividend for Slovaks
Reuters –  Fri 10 Oct, 2014

Diego Costa of Spain reacts during their Euro 2016 qualification soccer match against …
ZILINA Slovakia (Reuters) - Holders Spain suffered their first defeat in qualifying for a major tournament in eight years when Miroslav Stoch nodded a late goal to earn Slovakia a shock 2-1 victory in Euro 2016 Group C on Thursday.
A powerful, swerving free kick from Juraj Kucka in the 17th minute that deceived goalkeeper Iker Casillas put the hosts ahead and Spain struggled to find a way past inspired home goalkeeper Matus Kozacik despite dominating possession.
Substitute Paco Alcacer levelled for the visitors eight minutes from time but any hopes the 2008 and 2012 champions had of snatching a winner were shattered when Stoch headed past Casillas in the 87th minute.
It is the first time Spain have lost a qualifier in the European Championship or World Cup since they were beaten by Sweden in October 2006 and it sparked wild celebrations among the Slovakia players and supporters.
"They hit us on the counter attack, we lost concentration and they scored a second goal," Alcacer told the Spanish television broadcaster TVE.
"There are still plenty of games to turn things around," added the Valencia forward. "It will do us good as it means we won't let ourselves make the same mistake again."
Slovakia, who won 1-0 in Ukraine in their opening qualifier last month and are ranked 40th in the world, top Group C with a maximum six points. Spain have three after they began their campaign with a 5-1 triumph at home to Macedonia.
Ukraine and Macedonia also have three points and Luxembourg and Belarus a point each.
BRIGHT START
Slovakia made a bright start at the MSK stadium in Zilina and Casillas had to conjure a brilliant reaction save to keep out Robert Mak's 11th-minute volley.
Forward Diego Costa, who has been in red-hot form for Chelsea but has failed to score for Spain in six appearances, nodded a Cesc Fabregas centre narrowly wide two minutes later before Kucka struck.
The champions went close to an equaliser at a corner moments before the break when Kozacik denied first Costa and then Sergio Busquets with a pair of fine saves and the Slovakia players were given a standing ovation as they trooped off.
Spain pressed hard at the start of the second period and Fabregas and Costa went close as they tried to break through the massed Slovak ranks.
Coach Vicente del Bosque threw on Pedro and Alcacer to try to add extra zip to the Spain attack and although the visitors thought they had secured at least a point when Alcacer scored, there was still time for substitute Stoch to bury his header past Casillas.
The 24-year-old, who plays for Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates, tore off his shirt in celebration before being engulfed by ecstatic team mates.

Tesla s D puts it in the big leagueTesla reveals the D: Two motors and all-wheel-drive
By Peter Valdes-Dapena and Rachel Crane   @CNNMoney October 10, 2014: 1:50 AM ET
 
See Tesla's D in 60 seconds
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
"The D" touted by Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk is here, and it's a dual motor, all-wheel-drive sedan with mind-bending performance numbers.
The improvements build on the company's current Model S, offering better traction, more driving range and futuristic automated features. And some serious speed.
Model S sedans equipped with Tesla's 85 kWh battery pack and the dual-motor all-wheel-drive system will be able to go from zero to 60 miles an hour in just 3.2 seconds. That puts it in the same league as high-performance cars including the Porsche 911 Turbo and the Mercedes-Benz E63 .
To reach those speeds, the cars will have three driver-selectable settings: "Normal," Sport" and "Insane."
The car will have slightly more driving range on a full charge than the two-wheel-drive version. That means that with an 85 kWh battery pack the all-wheel-drive car will go 275 miles instead of 265 with rear-wheel-drive car.
 
Elon Musk: Big risks 'make me unhappy'
Tesla is also adding semi-automomous driving features to its cars that will allow owners to leave some of the driving to the car's on-board computers. The features will come standard, and the automaker has been building them into cars on the assembly line for the past two weeks.
These systems use sensors and cameras to help keep the car in its lane on highways while maintaining a safe following distance behind cars ahead.
The car will be able to automatically change lanes while avoiding other vehicles when the driver uses the turn signal. It will also change the car's speed automatically to adjust to different speed limits as determined by cameras that read speed limit signs.
While using these "autopilot" features, drivers will not be required to keep their hands on the steering wheel.

The car will be able to park itself and, when on private property, an owner will be able to summon the car. The car will also be able to connect with the owner's calendar so that it can be ready when needed.

With both the active driving features and all-wheel-drive systems, Tesla is matching technologies offered by other luxury automakers but adding additional features. Other automakers offer "active cruise control" systems but require a driver's hands to stay on the steering wheel. They also don't change lanes automatically.
Tesla's all-wheel-drive system provides added traction but also added performance efficiency.
Related: Cool cars from the Paris Motor Show
Until now, the Model S has been a strictly rear-wheel-drive car. All-wheel-drive is commonly offered by Tesla's luxury car competitors including Mercedes, BMW, Cadillac and Jaguar.
Particularly among luxury car brands, all-wheel-drive is considered a necessity to be competitive in major northeastern markets. About three quarters of luxury cars sold in northern states have all-wheel-drive, according to data from the automotive Web site Edmunds.com.
Tesla ( TSLA )'s shares were down 5% early Friday.
Even without all-wheel-drive, used Tesla Model S cars currently re-sell for almost as much as new cars. Consumer Reports has hailed it as the best model it has ever tested -- although the magazine later noted the car did suffer from a few reliability issues -- and it won Motor Trend's Car of the Year award in 2012 .

Tesla s stock drives itself off a cliffEMAIL

Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Tesla announced new electric car safety and performance features Thursday , but investors pressed the eject button on the stock as many expected more.
Shares of Tesla (TSLA) Friday closed down $20.10, or 7.8%, to $236.91 as investors started looking at whether this money-losing company is really a stock worth $32 billion. Even CEO and entrepreneur Elon Musk back in early September warned the stock was “kinda high” when it was trading for around $280 a share. The selloff in Tesla is one reason why the Nasdaq is getting hammered again Friday.
Investors are used to Musk not just meeting expectations, but blowing them away. He’s the same entrepreneur behind space exploration firm SpaceX, which has reinvented the way the U.S. gets into space.
So the buzz was mounting big-time coming into the announcement of Tesla’s newest developments and investors wanted the moon. Instead, investors got the announcement of a auto-pilot safety features and the Model D models with four-wheel drive and rapid acceleration.
Despite the selloff, analysts remain somewhat bullish on the stock. The average analyst rating on the stock is outperform and the 18-month price target is $268.
But even some analysts, who are constructive on Tesla’s future, see the stock simply being overpriced. Brian Johnson, analyst at Barclays, has a price target on the stock of $220 a share. That’s still 7% lower than Friday’s closing price.
 

Advice for investors worried about retirementA word of advice for investors worried about retirement savings

Many jittery investors are worried about their retirement savings given the recent volatility of the stock market. The Dow was down 273 points Tuesday, up 275 Wednesday and down 335 points Thursday.
“The market will have its ups and downs, but it’s important to stay the course,” says John Sweeney, Fidelity Investments’ executive vice president of retirement and investing strategies.
“While October gets a bad rap for having the most market declines, it’s important to look at the story the long term picture tells,” Sweeney says. “If you look at the S&P over a 20-year period, October had the second highest median return of any month — 1.76%.”
If you are five to 10 years from retirement, that’s a long period of time over which your portfolio can grow so you should be thinking about an equity portfolio that will outpace inflation, he says.
“Equities are higher risk but have higher expected returns over the long term and enable investors to earn returns that exceed inflation,” Sweeney says. Your other choices are cash, money markets, bonds. In today’s environment, bonds are not allowing your portfolio to grow at a rate that exceeds inflation, he says.
If you have a sum of money and are worried about investing it all today, take portions of it and invest it over a period of time so you are getting an average rate, buying more shares when they are less expensive and fewer shares when prices rise. You could invest it each month for the next six months or invest one quarter of it every month for four months, he says.
Exactly how much money you’ll need for retirement is complicated because there are so many variables, including your essential expenses (housing, food health care) and discretionary expenses (travel, clothes, entertainment, dining out). Everybody’s situation is going to be a little different. People often underestimate how long they are going to live. A quarter of us will live into our early 90s, so we are really planning for a retirement that could last 30 years or more.
Fidelity offers this rule of thumb: Save at least eight times your final salary to help increase the odds that you won’t outlive your savings during 30 years in retirement. This amount assumes that you’ll get some money from Social Security and that your expenses after you retire will be lower than when you were working. Higher net-worth folks usually need to save more than eight times their final salary.

Fair winds  but slow pick-upThe Hindu Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan
TOPICS
recession/slowdown
On a day when official data showed further weakening of the industrial sector, Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan said here on Friday that the Indian economy was expected to weaken further and a recovery was likely only beyond December.
He cautioned that despite the sharp surge in sentiment in the economy, captured by consumer and investor confidence surveys, including by the Reserve Bank, a pick-up in investments would take time.
“We have to accept that recoveries are not straight-line recoveries … there is volatility around the general trend … investment is yet to pick up on a strong basis, [though] we are seeing signs of the coming together of conditions for it [including a stable government that has signalled pro-investments initiatives] … there will be slight weakening compared with the first quarter in the second and third quarters, but beyond that we will hopefully see some strengthening of the economy,” he told The Hindu in an interview here.
Dr. Rajan is here to attend the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group annual meetings.
Slowing output
Official data released in New Delhi on Thursday showed factory output growth slowed further to 0.4 per cent in August, marginally lower than the 0.5 per cent in July.
Manufacturing growth shrunk further by (-)1.4 per cent compared to (-)1.1 per cent in July. Capital goods production slid sharply by (-)11.3 per cent against (-)3.8 per cent reflecting an absence of investment activities. Consumer goods production since April is down (-)4.9 per cent against (-)1.6 per cent, indicating household demand continues to weaken sharply.
“Even with all the sentiment in the world, it takes time for investment intentions to pick up and investors to put the assets on the ground. Consumer demand can quickly pick up but it is affected by new jobs,” Dr. Rajan said. In its Monetary Policy Report released on September 30, the Reserve Bank had said that consumer expectations were at the highest level since the financial crisis in 2008 and business expectations were at an 11-quarter high. The National Democratic Alliance government had announced a number of initiatives to improve the ease of doing business in India to back up Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s invitation to global manufacturers to “Make in India.”
It, however, said that its own expectations of conditions conducive to revival in investments, fiscal consolidation and sustained disinflation remained “broadly unchanged” from the pre-election level because of which it was not revising upwards its April projection for 2014-15 growth of 5.5 per cent.

India seek home comfort against Windies0
MS Dhoni during a practice session.
All those who believe that India's best suit in cricket are the shorter formats, may have been shell-shocked watching the World Champions lose the first of their five One-Day Internationals (ODI) against the West Indies, that too in their backyard.
Before going into the match nothing suggested that India could be beaten -- let alone thrashed by 124 runs -- but not because the West Indies are a bad ODI side. The suspicion was the motivation levels of the visitors could not have been high after their threatened pull-out of the series over a payment dispute with their Board.
Had the West Indies resorted to trade union tactics and refused to take the field at Kochi on Wednesday, the person who would have been hugely embarrassed was Narayanaswami Srinivasan who as chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC) worked out the new deal for all the member countries along with Cricket Australia (CA) and England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).
As suspected, the Indian board (read Srinivasan) intervened and the trade union tactics of West Indies captain Dwayne Bravo were stopped in the tracks. Obviously, the players wanted to prove the point to their board that they deserved all that they are demanding by playing the match as if they were possessed.
Like India, the West Indies also fancy their chances in 50 and 20 overs cricket. Yet for a team that won the first 25 of the 30 matches against India in the 1980s, they slipped badly in the subsequent decades and are now 59-50 head-to-head.
Since 2011, the year of the last World Cup, India beat them in 12 of the 18 matches and that's good enough reason for people to believe that India will not lose. They may still not lose the series but skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni's promised experiments ahead of the 2015 World Cup in the Antipodes may have to be put on hold as their prime concern now is to win the series and make sure the batsmen get back into form. They will have to rework their strategy.
Dhoni's first experiment should have been, for a change, to bat first on winning the toss. Also why did he develop cold feet while selecting the playing eleven in not blooding teenager Kuldeep Yadav. He could have seen how the left-armer's googly and Chinaman would work against the visiting batsmen.
All those who thought it would be a cakewalk are talking of changes in the eleven. The defeat could have been a lot worse had it not been for a defiant 42-run last-wicket stand between Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami.
The teams cannot be changed in a knee-jerk reaction to a defeat. The simple fact is that India lost the plot in the field and were clueless as Marlon Samuels and Denesh Ramdin hammered the attack in a match-winning stand.
A remarkable coincidence, India's worst defeat against the Caribbean at home by 135 runs came in 2002 at Vijayawada and the architect of that victory was also Marlon Samuels , who made 108 off 75 balls. Then the target was 316. This time it was 321 and Samuels scored his highest ODI score.
In the first 20 overs there was little to choose between the teams except that India lost two wickets, one more than the visitors. You can't be chasing a 321-run target with only four batsmen getting into double figures and only three of those crossing 20.
All the top order batsmen except Shikhar Dhawan failed to come good and unfortunately he was responsible for triggering the collapse by senselessly getting his opening partner Ajinkya Rahane run out when the two dug in with careful batting.
Which one of these top-order batsmen could be dropped after one failure unless Kohli's miserable showing in England is held against him? Even Ambati Rayudu seemed to have cemented his place on England tour. Here a word about Rohit Sharma who is out with an injury. He has been the most consistent run-getter against the West Indies since 2011 and won most of the matches for India.
On paper, the West Indies look much stronger with depth in batting and the luxury of playing five bowlers, including a genuine spinner. India played two spinners with Ravindra Jadeja , the man who bowled the most overs in ODIs this year. Playing leggie Amit Mishra backfired, but then he is coming back after a long injury lay-off.
Frankly, it is the batting that has let the team down. The batsmen came good any number of times chasing 300-plus score in recent years. Imagine the same side hammered the West Indies for 418 in December 2011 to win the match by 153 runs at Indore, which curiously did not get another international game after that. But then Virender Sehwag was there and he struck a double century (219) there.

Offline mobile retailers seek regulator for ...All India Mobile Retailers Association
(“We don’t want that…)
NEW DELHI: A grouping of small and medium-sized mobile phone retailers has decided to seek the formation of an independent regulatory authority to ensure a level playing field between online and brick-and-mortar stores, days after it urged the government to conduct an inquiry into the massively discounted prices offered by competing e-tailers.
Hurt by the "predatory prices" offered by e-commerce players such as Amazon , Flipkart and Snapdeal during the ongoing sales in the run-up to Diwali, the All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA) general secretary Dheeraj Malik said the body wants all retailers to follow fair trade practices.
"We don't want that online retail alone should be regulated; the rules should be same for all retailers, online or offline. We want a level playing field," Malik told ET after the body held its first national-level meeting late Thursday night.
Mobile phones are among the highest selling products on online portals. During the festive season, sale volumes for all consumer products rise dramatically and retailer margins rise from 10-15% to up to 20%.
Malik said the association was talking to the government and had met minister of state for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday, seeking an inquiry committee into the discounts being offered by the etailers.
Flipkart clocked about Rs 600 crore in sales in just 10 hours, with its site recording one billion hits in a day-long pre-Diwali discount sale on Monday.
Online sales account for just 1% of India'sRs 30 lakh crore retail industry but are projected to grow rapidly.
Softening their stand on boycotting certain brands, retailers said they will work with brands to ensure continuity of business but make them aware of problems caused by rampant and heavy discounting online.
"We do not want the consumer to get a raw deal. They should have the option of online pricing, but the discounting is so high it is threatening the business of hundreds of retailers and the indirect industry it supports," Malik said.

MH17 passenger  had oxygen mask onPrint
THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The body of one passenger on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was found wearing an oxygen mask, Dutch prosecutors said Thursday, raising questions about how much those on board knew about their fate as their plane went down above eastern Ukraine in July.
The passenger, an Australian, did not have the mask on his face but its elastic strap was around his neck, said Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for the Dutch National Prosecutor's Office, which is carrying out a criminal investigation into the disaster.
De Bruin said Dutch forensic experts investigated the mask "for fingerprints, saliva and DNA and that did not produce any results. So it is not known how or when that mask got around the neck of the victim."
De Bruin said no other bodies from the wreckage were found wearing masks. He said he did not know where the Australian victim had been sitting in the plane.
All 298 passengers and crew died when the jet flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur ended up in pieces July 17. Dutch air crash investigators said it was likely struck by multiple "high-energy objects" which some aviation experts say is consistent with a missile strike.
The head of the criminal investigation said the most likely scenario being investigated is that the Boeing 777 was shot down from the ground.
The Australian passenger's relatives were told about the mask as soon as it was discovered but other victims' relatives only heard about it for the first time Wednesday when Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans mentioned it on a talk show.
After those relatives began calling, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement Thursday saying Timmermans regretted his comments.
"I have an enormous amount of sympathy for the next-of-kin," he said. "The last thing I want to do is compound their suffering."

Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered its outlook on France to negative from stable, reflecting the "constrained real and nominal growth prospects" for the country's economy against the background of policy implementation risk.
The ratings agency also affirmed France's unsolicited "AA" long-term and "A-1 plus" short-term sovereign credit ratings .
The country laid down the gauntlet to EU partners on Oct 1 with a 2015 budget setting out how it would bring its borrowing back to within EU limits two years later than promised, a retreat it blamed on a fragile economy.

We want to be a bellwether again: Vishal Sik...acquisitions
(It is too early to forecast…)
Vishal Sikka's first earnings presentation as Infosys CEO was centred on the themes of automation, artificial intelligence and 'design thinking,' the latter phrase that describes a creative, user-centred approach to problem-solving. Sikka also addressed questions on some long-standing issues and investor concerns. Excerpts:
On Automation And Artificial Intelligence
I want to make a big mention of automation. Artificial intelligence as a domain is not very well understood. It is often associated with precipitating... the irrelevance of humanity. Having studied at Stanford and other places at the feet of the pioneers of this domain, I see the word fundamentally differently.
Technology has always been about the amplification of the human be ing. About augmenting them with new capabilities, not about making them irrelevant.
On Design Thinking
We are starting Design Thinking training in a massive way . We have already done sessions for many of our leaders, for example in consulting and our sales leadership, together with Stanford University's d.school (design school). We are putting together a very large design thinking training session for all Infosys employees at Mysore as well as our development centres. This will help us train tens of thousands of Infosys employees on Design Thinking over the next few months.
On Target Margins
It is too early to forecast that, but based on the strategy that I have articulated, we should be able to get into 15-18% growth in the long term, and 25-28% margins. I see no reason why, over a long term, we couldn't achieve such numbers.
On Acquisitions
The key idea is to not acquire yesterday's products and services companies, but to acquire capabilities and skills of tomorrow that help us grow in areas that are strategic to us.Beyond the technology and the skills, we also want to use the inorganic strategy to get into some other penetrative but high-growth areas, and some geographies, where acquisitions can help us achieve our objectives faster.
On Working With Startups
Infosys can enable startups to attain great engineering speed, scale and global reach by helping them amplify their development at the right moment, combined with joint go-tomarket where we can help bring startups to our clients. Strategic investment from our $100-million venture fund, to help bring Infosys into close collaboration with today's startups, will lead to great companies of the future.
On Sales Team
We do see meaningful changes on the sales front. Our sales team is actively engaged in renewing its own capabilities through both reskilling and retraining, and bringing in new talent. We have already done Design Thinking training sessions with our sales players.
On Finacle
Our Finacle business did not have such a great quarter, and posted a 5.4% decline in quarter-on-quarter revenue. We just announced a leadership change for this unit, and we will be executing plans on several dimensions to return this business to growth and success.
On Renewing Business Lines
When we think about renewing the landscape, we believe that everyone, in every business, in every industry, needs to renew their existing systems and processes, and for Infosys this means a renewal of our existing business lines.
On Offering Next Gen Services
Every service that we offer today will be renewed on the basis of innovation, automation and improvements in process efficiency . As such there is no old or new service. It is simply an old way or a new way of doing the same services. In addition to renewing the services that we have today , we believe that there is an additional need for new kinds of technology such as new kinds of platforms for new data, machine learning, big data and so forth.

Flipkart puts spotlight on e-tailersworld wide web
Predictably, the Flipkart fiasco has galvanized the offline retailers to close ranks, and even demand regulation of e-commerce, which is just beginning to gain some toe-hold in the Indian retail space.
Home-grown online retailer Flipkart appears to have lost more than what it has gained from the Monday’s ‘big billion day’ sales extravaganza. 
Flipkart claims that it had hit the 24-hour sales target inside 10 hours on that day. If success is defined only by numbers, it has reason to cheer.
Clearly, Flipkart was the talk of the town that day. It was so far all the negative reasons, however. So much so, the founders have to come out the very following day to publicly say sorry in a lengthy email to angry customers, who felt cheated. Flipkart founders sought to assuage their feelings by acknowledging their failure to anticipate the glitches when the sales commenced Monday morning, leaving many frustrated and furious.
Predictably, the Flipkart fiasco has galvanized the offline retailers to close ranks, and even demand regulation of e-commerce, which is just beginning to gain some toe-hold in the Indian retail space.
The Monday sales extravaganza of Flipkart has raised several issues, which will have far-reaching social implications. 
Freebies, deep discounts, and attractive offers – they aren’t the recent trend. We have seen how, in the 90s, the non-banking finance companies of unincorporated kind had caused havoc, putting many a gullible investor to permanent misery and even forcing the Reserve Bank of India to tighten the screws on them.
The NBFC industry is still recovering from that shock. More recently, we have been witness to a no-holds-barred ‘sky war’, causing huge disruptions in the airline industry. In the first instance, unsuspecting investors were the casualty. In the second one, the public at large is indirectly paying since the public sector banks have lent heavily to the airline industry.
‘Customer is the king’, it is often said. The so-called king of free market was virtually taken for a free online ride by Flipkart. It is not just the question of access to the site. It is also not about the inability to buy intended goods on offer. It is not even about technical glitches. It is all about the intention. What is the intention? Is it just about hitting a particular sales number by somehow?
In a close-ended offer of this kind, one does anticipate a big rush. With a kind of ad blitzkrieg unleashed by Flipkart on Monday morning, it was a sure invitation to stampede. The limited offering in each product – even at deep discounts – means the loss is defined upfront for Flipkart. Perhaps, the online retailer expected the gain in terms of brand awareness to outweigh loss due to `discounted sales’.  
The other issue is about servicing the products bought online at such deep discounts. Big white goods makers have already reportedly logged off Flipkart for its distorting act of offering predatory pricing. Some have even threatened to take legal route to stop online retailers from offering such deep discounts.
The single-day product-wise limited offerings has indeed helped Flipkart get the desired number and also visibility. What has surprised a lay observer is that these e-commerce firms have elicited huge PE (private equity) interest. Many PE players have rushed in to place heavy money on them.
There is nothing like a free lunch. These PE players will take out more than what they have invested in these e-commerce firms sooner than later. In the modern day, perception often times determines the valuation, which may be disproportionate to the age, size and sales number of a firm.
The timing of the big bang sale by Flipkart could not be wished away, coming as it did in the wake of a high-profile visit of Amazon boss to India a few days ago. What is the differentiator in the e-commerce world? Just the competitive deep discounts! In the game of one-upmanship, the ‘big billion day’ may have helped Flipkart drive its market value up.
The moot point, however, is: Does the end justify the mean? Flipkart has opened up a fresh debate, and the world of e-commerce has suddenly come under intense scrutiny.

Sunandas death due to poison: autopsy reportcrime, law and justice
Sunanda Pushkar, wife of Shashi Tharoor, MP, died because of the presence of “poison” in the body, says the final post-mortem report.
The finding will pave the way for the Delhi Police to register a First Information Report against unknown persons and take up the investigation again.
The final report, prepared by the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences after studying the viscera report, says Sunanda’s death was caused by “poison” and not by an “overdose of Alprax.” This contradicts the preliminary report, which said “Alprax” was detected in the body.
The report, which says Sunanda had no ailments, was submitted to the Station House Officer of Sarojini Nagar Police station on September 30. “The report only says ‘poison’ in the body. The Medical Board has reserved comments on the specific poison,” a source said.
The report also raises queries on the police investigation so far. “Opinion on the duration of the injuries has been given already. However, the reason for these physical injuries, circumstantial evidences and statements have not been submitted by the Investigation Officer despite sending a letter in this regard on April 4, 2014,” it adds.

Pakistan firing abates after India's strong response
Firing and shelling by Pakistan Rangers across the international border paused after the Modi government took a strong stand warning Pakistan that it would pay an unaffordable price if shelling and machine-gun fire continued.

NEW DELHI: After days of heavy firing and mortar shelling across the international border in Jammu and Karsmir, fighting between India and Pakistan paused after the Modi government took a strong stand warning Pakistan that it would pay an unaffordable price if shelling and machine-gun fire continued.
Civilians living in the area hit hardest by the shelling expressed relief at the halt in firing.
"We hope calm prevails and the border shooting ends," said Avtar Singh, 45, after taking refuge in a nearby school. "Our condition in this school is very bad. We want to go back to our homes."
Both countries have accused each other of starting the latest hostilities that have hit civilian areas. India says it will not talk to Pakistan or stop firing until its neighbour backs down first.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi Thursday said Indian forces have sent a a strong message across the border amid continuing truce violations.
Modi said "times have changed" and Indian soldiers have given a demonstration of their capability and their bravery.
"Now old habits are of no use, the soldiers have given an introduction of their bravery, and they (enemy) have come to realize that the times have changed; and old times and habits have changed. Our brave soldiers have given the correct reply, and these matters should not be politicized," the prime minister said.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will Friday hold a meeting with the National Security Committee (NSC) here regarding the ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC).
The meeting will be attended by service chiefs, chairman joint chiefs of staff committee, defence minister, interior minister, finance minister and information and national security adviser with high security officials.
On Thursday, Pakistani forces again started targeting civilian areas and BSF positions near the International Border in Jammu and Kathua districts of Jammu and Kashmir, an official said.
"Pakistan Rangers are firing with mortars and automatic weapons in RS Pura sector of Jammu and Hirnagar sector of Kathua," a police officer told IANS, adding that the Pakistan firing started at 7 pm and was still continuing two hours later.
Most villages along the International Border in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts have been evacuated since Pakistan Rangers resorted to targeting villages and BSF positions since Oct 6.
Nine Pakistani and eight Indian civilians have been killed since both sides' security forces started firing more than a week ago along a 200-km stretch of border.
Almost 20,000 Indian civilians have fled their homes in the lowlands around India's Jammu region to escape the fighting, taking refuge in schools and relief camps.

Sun rapped for lax in follow-up of recalled ...FDA
(The inspectors chided the…)
NEW DELHI: India's top drug maker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries has received a rap from the United States regulator for being lax in monitoring the follow-up corrective actions for the drugs it recalled from the US market early this year.
The company has not put in place a proper formalised corrective and preventive action plan for the diabetes drug (Metformin extended release) it recalled, the US Food & Drug Administration investigators noted after inspecting Sun Pharma's Halol plant in Gujarat last month, according to a copy of form 483 reviewed by ET. The form is used by the FDA to document concerns discovered during its inspections.
The company failed in the requisite measures despite telling the US government that "all the (corrective) actions (related to Metformin drug recall) have been implemented", the investigators added. Similarly, the company did not put in place any formal corrective plans for anxiety drug Venlafaxine Hydrochloride extended release tablets, for which it initiated a recall four months ago, the inspectors noted.
They further noted that the building used in the manufacturing of a drug product "is not maintained in a good state of repair". "For example, on September 8, 2014 we observed water stains with ceiling damage and on September 12, 2014 we observed water leaks from the ceiling in the personnel corridor of the parenteral manufacturing area," the team of FDA investigators Parul Patel, Daniel Roberts and Thomas Arista noted.
These are part of 23 adverse observations that the investigators have made in three separate categories - unit for making solid drugs (tablets, capsules), parenteral drugs (injectables, intravenous products) and the quality control lab.
A Sun Pharma spokesperson refused to comment on the matter. Analysts who have reviewed the document felt the chances of the US FDA blocking imports from the plant are slim but do not rule out future product approvals from the plant getting blocked. This could adversely impact the company's growth prospects in the US.
"There are no data integrity issues in the form and therefore chances of import alert are low. However, observations include several procedural issues where arresolution could take time and till then approvals could be blocked possibly," Anubhav Aggarwal of brokerage Credit Suisse said in a report.
This will impact the company's growth since its fastest growing division has been the US sales from the Indian plants, said the report, which estimated that the facility accounted for about 20-25% of the company's profits.
Another Gujarat-based plant of Sun Pharma at Karkhadi was banned from shipping to the US early this year.
The FDA investigators also objected to the practice of four-five individuals accessing sensitive production equipment through a common password. "There is no document to describe role and responsibilities of system administrators for the production equipment, no record to document the individuals who have access to production equipment," says the form 483.
The inspectors chided the firm for not documenting alarm events that occur during the routine tablet compression, among other observations.
Facilities of leading Indian drug makers including Ranbaxy (which Sun is in the process of acquiring) and Wockhardt were blacklisted by the US regulator last year. The FDA has been intensifying scrutiny on companies in India, the second-largest supplier of generic drugs to the country.
The drug regulator has said it will increase its activity in India as the country is the source for more than 40% of generics and over-the-counter drugs used in the US.

Indian Super League to kick-off in Kolkata o...Alibaba
(ISL is a smaller operation.…)
NEW DELHI: When Athletico de Kolkata host Mumbai City FC at the 68,000-seater Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday, it will see India's two big passions -- Bollywood and cricket - come together with the hope of creating a third one that pulls the masses, feeds their hunger for stardom, brings in the money and is for keeps.
They have basked in, or seen, the rush for the Indian Premier League (IPL), the city-based cricket league. But they will find the Indian Super League (ISL), football's answer to the IPL in India, to be a different ballgame, one that will take a lot more to come together and will need much more time to do so. "We should reach close to breakeven by year five," admits Gaurav Modwel, CEO of FC Pune City, the Pune franchise. "In the long run, I think, it might be bigger than the IPL."
There are many parallels between the ISL and IPL models. They are both city-based sporting leagues, with eight teams each. The bulk of a team's revenues come from dividing what is called the 'central pool' in the IPL, which comprises TV rights and principal sponsorships.
In IPL, this central pool was substantial from the start and has since grown further. It's what enabled cricket franchises operating on annual costs of Rs 100-150 crore to post a profit or, at worst, end with a marginal loss.
ISL is, by comparison, a smaller operation. Each team is looking at an average annual cost of Rs 50 crore. It's not yet clear how much revenue they will end up with. A crude calculation done by ET, based on individual metrics provided by stakeholders in the league, suggest that teams are looking at a loss of Rs 20-30 crore in year one.
Besides the lower popularity of football, ISL also presents fewer --and smaller -- opportunities to monetise than IPL. Take advertising. A three-hour IPL match offers about 40-42 minutes of TV advertising, spaced out between overs.
By comparison, a 90-minute game of football only has a single break, of 15 minutes. "In this, seven-eight minutes will be for ads and the rest for programming," says Sanjay Gupta, chief operating officer at STAR India, the broadcaster and co-promoter of ISL. In addition, there will be about four minutes on either side of the match. That's about 16 minutes in all.
In the case of IPL, since TV rights were sold, the size of the central pool was known at the outset. In ISL, since STAR India is a co-promoter, along with sports management firm IMG and Reliance Industries, it is not paying any TV rights money. What comes to the central pool from the TV side is effectively a function of how many ads can be sold.
According to two stakeholders who didn't want to be named, at least half of these 16 minutes will go to the league sponsors. Hero MotoCorp is the principal sponsor, Maruti Suzuki the associate sponsor and Pepsi, Puma, Nice Gel and Muthoot Finance the remaining sponsors. Hero is paying Rs 54 crore for three years and Maruti Rs 20-22 crore, says a senior official of a media-buying firm representing a sponsor on condition of anonymity. "It always helps to get in early," says Manohar Bhat, vice president, marketing, Maruti Suzuki, while declining to reveal the sponsorship amount. "We are betting on the fact that it will be a success."
In the first year, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that if STAR sells eight minutes of ads per match at Rs 1 lakh per 10 seconds -- the rate for the recently concluded Fifa World Cup -- it will earn about Rs 29 crore from TV advertising.
Extrapolating the numbers reportedly paid by Hero and Maruti, the best-case scenario for sponsorship is about Rs 41 crore.
That's a total central pool of about Rs 70 crore. Of this, about 60-70% of central revenue is expected to be split among the eight teams -- or Rs 6-7 crore per team. Other revenue streams are expected to fetch teams about Rs 15 crore, resulting in a net loss of about Rs 15 crore.
It still might not be a bad longterm business, feels Vinit Karnik, national director, sports and live events at GroupM ESP. "Profit and loss is not the only metric to look at ISL," he says. "It's eventually a valuations game."
One lever for valuations is what makes India a 'can't-ignore' for global business and sport: its population, next only to China. About 150 million TV viewers in India watch soccer, primarily the European soccer leagues. "The challenge, however, is how are we going to convert the followers of European football to Indian football," says Karnik.
ISL franchises will look for tie-ups with global clubs. It's a symbiotic relationship. The foreign clubs can feed the Indian clubs marquee players; the Indian clubs can provide the foreign clubs new fans.
"Look at what happened in Chinese football," says Sameer Manchanda, chairman and managing director of DEN Networks , which owns the Delhi franchise. "Alibaba recently bought a 50% stake in Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club for around $192 million," he says. "This is the kind of opportunity we are looking at in ISL too."

Will recommend long only if Nifty holds 7900Ashwani Gujral
In a chat with ET Now, Ashwani Gujral , Fund Manager, Ashwanigujral.com, shares his views on the market.
ET Now: Today you had mentioned that even if we opened gap down, it might not be a bad idea to keep selective longs as well because eventually over the course of the next five or six days, we may show a bit of a bounce. Are you holding on to that stance and what are the specific names that you are recommending?
Ashwani Gujral: During the day, we saw a bit of a bounce and my strategy was that in case we are able to hold on to 7900 but I will remain long and possibly look for the market to move up. However, below 7900, we have taken some short positions. Now what is happening here is I like to look for how the market is reacting to good news. Yes, Infosys' came out with good news but the CNX IT is 100 points lower from its highs.
TCS is trading at the lows of the day so obviously somebody is selling good news. HPCL and BPCL are trading at lows of the day. So that for me is not a very comforting sign and it appears that maybe global headwinds are becoming way too strong for our markets to sustain at higher levels. So below 7900 you should not be long.
Going short is a personal preference and whether you are aware of how to do it. But overall in terms of BT/ST, HPCL is a sell with a stop of 515, target of 485; TCS is a sell with a stop of 2690, target of 2620; JSW Steel is a sell with a stop of 1180 and target of 1135.

BCCI hopes WI dispute will not affect series

The BCCI has expressed hope the ongoing series against West Indies will not be affected by the dispute between the players and the WICB and the West Indies Players Association, while revealing it had played the role of mediator when the situation reached crisis point before the first ODI in Kochi .
The West Indies players were mulling a strike before the first match due to concerns over a payment agreement between the WICB and the WIPA. ESPNcricinfo understands the BCCI's assurance to the West Indies players, to stand by them during their fight, was the key factor in the team's decision to play.

"I spoke with the boys and assured them the BCCI will discuss their problems with the WICB and help arrive at an amicable solution at the earliest," BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel told ESPNcricinfo. "We are hopeful that the series will not be affected."
It is believed WICB chief Whycliffe 'Dave' Cameron thanked Patel for playing the mediator's role in an email sent a day after the game. The BCCI secretary also denied rumours the Indian board had sanctioned a loan to the WICB to pay its players.
"I have been told that some of the regional media houses are running stories to this effect, even quoting the amount. Let me make it clear - nothing of this sort has been even discussed in the BCCI since the rules don't allow us. No financial transaction has taken place," Patel said.
During the last year's series in India, which was also Sachin Tendulkar 's farewell series, the BCCI had borne the daily allowance expenses of the West Indies players.

Kailash Satyarthi: A fearless crusader for child rightsKailash Satyarthi’s crusade to save childhood continues; 60 mn still need him
KumKum Dasgupta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 10, 2014
First Published: 14:50 IST(10/10/2014) | Last Updated: 11:49 IST(11/10/2014)
Before he became the second Indian to win the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, not many had heard Kailash Satyarthi’s name.
 
But within 90 minutes of the announcement, the child's rights activist had gained more than 4,500 followers on Twitter--and the list was growing at blazing speed.
 
The 60-year-old activist has been a relentless crusader of child rights and his organisation, the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), has been at the forefront of the drive against child labour in India for years.
Interview: 'The award will benefit the movement'
 
“It was a passion from my childhood to work for children, I carried it forward," said Satyarthi. “I have been very strongly advocating that poverty must not be used as an excuse to continue child labour. It perpetuates poverty. If children are deprived of education, they remain poor.”

Satyarthi was trained as an electrical engineer, but he began his work by staging raids on Indian manufacturing, rug-making and other plants where children and their parents often work as bonded labour.

The Bachpan Bachao Andolan, founded in 1980, has fought child labour by creating domestic and international consumer resistance to products made by bonded children, as well as with direct legal and advocacy work.
 
Building on his initial activism, Satyarthi organised the Global March Against Child Labor in the 1990s -- dedicated to freeing the millions of children abused worldwide in a form of modern slavery.
 
The activist is also founder of RugMark, a widely known international scheme that tags all carpets made in factories that are child-labour free.

In 1998, he organised the Global March Against Child Labour across 103 countries, which helped pave the way for an International Labor Organization convention on the worst forms of child labour.
 
He described the plight of children forced into the worst kinds of abusive work in a 2010 interview with the Robert F. Kennedy Centre for Justice and Human Rights.
 
"If they cry for their parents, they are beaten severely, sometimes hanged upside down from trees and even branded or burned with cigarettes," he said.
 
Satyarthi has said his social conscience was awoken when he was six and noticed a boy his age on the steps outside the school with his father, cleaning shoes.
Watch: 'Why I took up the cause of child rights'
Seeing many such children working instead of being educated, he felt an urge as he grew older to solve the problem -- launching him on his career of activism.
 
"I think of it all as a test. This is a moral examination that one has to pass. ... to stand up against such social evils," he said in the Kennedy Centre interview.
 
Through a number of training programmes, Satyarthi also helps children sold to pay off their parents' debts find new lives and serve as agents of prevention within their communities.
 
“The outstanding work that Mr Satyarthi has done over the past 35 years on child labour and trafficking has helped change mindsets and influence communities to protect children’s rights and create a more just society,” Deval Sanghavi, founder of Mumbai-based philanthropic organisation Dasra, told HT.
President Barack Obama on Friday congratulated Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai calling their Nobel “a victory for all who strive to uphold the dignity of every human being”.
Himself a Nobel peace laureate from 2009, Obama also said that despite their difference background, they share an “unshakeable belief in the basic dignity of every girl and boy”.

The Bachpan Bachao Andolan was initiated as a grassroot-level and direct-action-oriented people's movement in 1980 to eliminate exploitation of children, especially child labour and child trafficking. The campaign has over 80,000 individuals and 750 organisations as members, who advocate and act for the protection of child rights.
 
One of Satyarthi’s big achievements is the promotion of a consumer awareness campaign in Europe and the US aimed at dissuading consumers from buying carpets made by child labourers and simultaneously endorsing goods produced without exploiting children.
 
Satyarthi uses an array of techniques including lobbying with politicians and knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court, National Human Rights Commission and other judicial institutions for enforcement of child rights laws.

Smart City: Modi s Rs 78Kcr GIFT project hit...Ahmedabad
(The Gujarat government…)
NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government has ambitious plans to build 100 smart cities, but the first smart city that the Gujarat government had embarked on under then chief minister Modi in 2007 — the Rs 78,000 crore GIFT city is caught in red tape at the Centre, threatening its viability due to incomplete buildings, lack of power utility lines and most importantly, the absence of corporate tenants who were expected to populate it.
The Gujarat government has approached the Centre, now firmly under its previous boss' grip, to push long-pending clearances from the ministries of finance, highways and civil aviation, for the Gujarat International Finance Tec (GIFT) City so that its first phase can meet its 2014 deadline.
A 50:50 joint venture between a state government undertaking and Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (ILFS) Limited, GIFT city was planned as a global financial and IT services hub spread over 886 acres near Ahmedabad airport and is expected to create a million direct and indirect jobs.
Though the project was allowed to set up a multi-services special economic zone with an international financial services centre in 2011, not a single financial institution is ready to set up shop at the city yet, said officials, as the government is yet to issue any regulatory norms on carrying out operations within the financial services centre.
"We wanted GIFT City to be comparable to other global financial hubs like Shanghai, Tokyo and London, but not a single financier is ready to book space in the city due to the lack of norms. We have repeatedly requested both the finance and commerce ministries to notify some regulations for such operations, without which existing capacity isn't being utilised while further development of the project is hindered," said a state government official aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
The state has now urged the urban development ministry to intervene for an early resolution of the hiccups faced by the GIFT city. The ministry, in turn, has escalated the case to the project monitoring group set up in the cabinet secretariat to expedite stalled investment projects and the project's issues are now under examination, officials said. One of the biggest roadblock faced by GIFT City, is the aviation ministry's reluctance to grant height clearances most of the tall buildings expected to tower the city's length and breadth. This has thwarted construction work on most of its flagship towers being built in the first phase.
"The Airports Authority of India has only granted permission to build towers upto 191 metres above the mean sea level. At this height, 47 of the 110 buildings, including its biggest towers, cannot progress," the official quoted earlier said. The tallest of the 110 buildings that are part of the masterplan, named Diamond Tower, is expected to rise up to 410 metres, while two other towers would be over 350 metres tall.
GIFT City had requested the airport authority, which is also in charge of air space navigation services and related clearances in India, to grant it a height clearance for buildings upto 476 metres. Similarly, the National Highways Authority of India has been hesitant about granting permission to lay power cables to light up the City's infrastructure.

Delays hit road work along MRTS rail line

Repeated delays have plagued the development of a road along the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) rail line from Velachery to Taramani stations.
The road, which was initially supposed to be executed by the Southern Railway, has been hanging fire since 2009. A few years later, the Railways found that the place was prone to flooding and handed over the space to the Chennai Corporation that was executing stormwater drain networks along the perimeter of the road.
A senior official of the civic body said the department was waiting for a reply from the Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) about whether any water development work has to be executed, so that road cutting could be avoided. He said: “The vacant plots adjacent to the proposed road are bound to have better real estate value and so, utility agencies would undertake development work on the proposed road. We want to avoid the road cuts that happen due to miscommunication.”
An official said construction of the stormwater drain network has been completed and a six-vent culvert to channel the rainwater from the drain network to the Pallikaranai Marshland was in progress.
The official asserted that there would not be any spike in the project cost as the estimates for the Rs. 7.50-crore project has been completed and tenders finalised.
Motorists pointed out that if this road had been completed in time, they would have had to suffer less as the stretch could have served as an alternative to Taramani Link Road where road expansion work is on. That project has also been delayed.

Stop campaigning and go back to jail: HC to ChautalaPrint
NEW DELHI: Former Haryana chief minister and Indian National Lok Dal leader Om Prakash Chautala, who got bail on grounds of ill-health, has been asked to go back to jail by the Delhi High Court because despite his reported heart condition, he has been campaigning relentlessly for his party for the upcoming Haryana assembly polls.
Four time Haryana chief minister, Chautala, who is out on bail on health grounds has been addressing political rallies since late last month in violation of the bail conditions, has been asked to surrender at Tihar jail Saturday.
The Delhi High Court also directed him to stop addressing political rallies.
"I am pained and disappointed with Chautala's act. Now that he is discharged from hospital, he should surrender," the court remarked.
The order has come as a blow to the Indian National Lok Dal which had been gaining political ground in recent days for the Oct 15 assembly elections in Haryana. The crowds at INLD rallies had started swelling ever since Chautala started addressing them. He addressed dozens of rallies across Haryana in the past fortnight.
The former chief minister is serving a 10-year prison term after his conviction in a teachers' recruitment scam by a CBI court in Delhi in January last year.
He was later granted bail by the Delhi High Court after he pleaded that he was undergoing medical treatment at Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon.
The High Court order came on a petition filed by an individual who pointed out that Chautala was blatantly violating bail conditions. The CBI also pleaded before the court that Chautala's bail be cancelled.
Taking a jibe at Chautala, Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed said only the Central Bureau of Investigation can ascertain his illness as doctors have no capacity to do so.
Describing Chautala's case to be unique, Ahmed said: "He is 80 plus. He is out on bail on the ground of illness. He travels usually by air ambulance, but he addresses 31 meetings in one day. I am much much younger than Chautala, we get exhausted by addressing five to six meetings per day. So, only the CBI can ascertain the illness of Mr. Chautala because the doctors have no capacity to ascertain the illness of Chautala."
"So, CBI is the only source to ascertain what kinds of illness where a person who is travelling by air ambulance addresses more than 30 meetings a day," he added.
All 90 assembly seats in Haryana go to polls Oct 15. The results will be known Oct 19.

Delhi fares worse than national average in terms of unemployment
Vishal Kant
Tweet
Even as people flock to the Capital in search of jobs, a sample survey data has revealed that the unemployment rate in Delhi is more than the national average of unemployment rate in the urban area.
As per the Report on Employment & Unemployment situation in Delhi prepared by the Directorate of Economics & Statistics of the Delhi Government, the unemployment rate in the urban area of Delhi is 40 per thousand persons in labour force as compared to 34 per thousand in urban area at the national level.
The report is based on a sample survey conducted during 68th round of the National Sample Survey during 2011-12.
However, Delhi’s performance is better than the figures recorded in the urban areas of several other states like Haryana (42), Uttar Pradesh (41), J&K (70), Chandigarh (64) and 43 per thousand in the urban area of Andhra Pradesh.
However, the total number of unemployed in the city is only about 1.5 per cent of the total work force.
“About 57.60 lakh persons (33.39 percent of the total population) were employed and only 2.66 lakh persons (1.56 per cent of the total) were unemployed in Delhi. Out of the 2.66 lakh unemployed persons, about 2.12 lakh were male and remaining 0.54 lakh were female,” an official said.
However, over 90 per cent of the unemployed are youngsters. “Out of 2.66 lakh unemployed persons, about 2.50 lakh (93.84 per cent) were in the category of 15-29 years,” an official said.

Lack of manpower leaves toilets in South Delhi dirty or otherwise locked
Public toilets in South Delhi are still filthy and many remain closed to the public a month after senior local body officials inspected the facilities and found them in a sad state.
Congress leaders in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation had inspected community toilet complexes (CTCs) and waterless urinals on September 7 only to find them dirty and lacking water and sewage connections.
On Friday, SDMC Deputy Mayor Praveen Rana, Leader of the Opposition Farhad Suri and Sriniwaspuri councillor Indu Verma inspected sanitation in South Delhi. At a waterless urinal facility on Lodhi Road, the stench and filth was so bad that a senior citizen was forced to relieve himself outside the complex.
Another facility at Ashram, which the Congress leaders had inspected on September 7, was still not connected to water and sewers. A local shopkeeper, Harjeet Singh, said the facility had been in a sorry state for three years.
“There is no one to clean the urinals. We, the shopkeepers, are forced to use these as they are the only ones in the entire area. So, we clean them ourselves when the smell becomes too bad,” said Mr. Singh.
Another nearby shopkeeper, Shiv Kumar, added that there were no toilets for ladies in all of Ashram. “Ladies who come to this area have to knock on doors and request residents to use their toilets,” said Mr. Kumar.
At Srinivaspuri’s L-Market, fixtures at a waterless urinal were caked with filth as it had not been cleaned in at least a month. “This urinal is hardly cleaned. The stench is unbearable so no one can use it anymore,” said Inderjeet Singh, a member of the Srinivaspuri Vikas Manch.
Ms. Verma said since the waterless urinal had been given to a private company to run, the SDMC can’t maintain it. “I have personally called the contractors for the toilets and the garbage dumps numerous times, but we are lucky if they come once a month,” said the councillor.
While these facilities were filthy, a CTC outside Lady Shri Ram College was locked. Locals said it had been shut for years, but the contractor had consistently displayed advertisements on its façade. The Hindu had already reported on Sunday that this facility on Kalka Devi Marg, near the Aman Colony police station, was locked.
Mr. Suri said: “What Swachh Bharat campaign are we talking about when we haven’t been able to give basic facilities like public toilets.”
However, the civic body is in the process of taking back these facilities from the concessionaires (Prabhatam Group and GraphisAds). SDMC Commissioner Manish Gupta said there was a long legal dispute between two concessionaires and civic body.
He said on October 1, Prabhatam Group has agreed to surrender 165 waterless urinals, which the SDMC is in the process of repairing. GraphisAds, which had 38 waterless urinals, will be upgrading the facilities and SDMC officials will monitor the work. Mr. Gupta said the repair and maintenance work should be finished by October 31.

Opening gets the best out of me - Rohit SharmaTweet
0
Rohit welcomes competition.India batsman Rohit Sharma believes opening improves his game and has welcomed competition for that spot in the ODI side. Since Rohit was sidelined with finger and shoulder injuries in September, Ajinkya Rahane has stepped in and has performed well at the top.
"Competition will always be good for the game," Rohit told DNA. "Guys will try harder and produce good results. Personally, I am not even thinking (about competition) as I have a lot of other things to do like get fit first and work my way back onto the field."
Rahane was "very well-suited to do the opening job" according to his captain MS Dhoni. He has occupied that position for a majority of his domestic career and a collected a maiden ODI century in England as well. Rohit, though, was converted into an opening batsman in January 2013 and the move brought about resurgence in his career. He averages 43.20 from 39 innings as opener compared to an average of 31.72 in 79 innings at other positions.
"As an opener, you have to be a little more cautious with the two new balls moving around," he said. "The ball does quite a bit. While opening, you have to be extra focused. Being cautious has helped my batting. It's not that when you bat in the middle order, there is no challenge or you have to be a little less cautious, but opening has helped get the best out of me."
Rohit's primary focus at the moment is on recuperating. He had to miss the Champions League T20 and the ongoing West Indies ODIs, but is hopeful of playing the Tests and the one-day tri-series with England and Australia in Australia before the World Cup.
"Finger is fine. I am feeling well. It's almost 70-80% healed. It is in the last stage of healing. I am going to start gripping my bat from tomorrow (Friday)."

What is the significance of Karwa ChauthBigg Boss 8
What is the significance of Karwa Chauth?
On Karwa Chauth, the married women keep a fast without drinking even a drop of water throughout the day. The festival is celebrated 9 days prior to Diwali, on the fourth day of the Hindu calendar month Kartik. Karwa Chauth is an extremely popular festival in the northern and western parts of India.
GaneshaSpeaks.com –  Wed 8 Oct, 2014 5:08 PM IST
Share 0
Karwa Chauth is a ritual that the married women follow to seek prosperity, longevity and good health of their husbands. "Chauth" means the fourth day and "Karwa" is an earthen pot with a spout. The pot symbolises peace and prosperity and is necessary for the rituals that are followed on this festival.
Reference/ Story related to the festival of Karwa Chauth
undefinedIn the ancient times, it was a tradition to get the girls married at a very young age and send them to their in-laws place right after the marriage. Moreover, these young married women often didn't have any friends or relatives in their in-laws families to share their grievances and joys with. Besides, their own families lived far away and communication channels were not as fast and smooth as they are today. So they had nobody to talk to about their emotions and problems once they got married. This situation led to the formation of a ritual wherein the bride would befriend another woman in the in-law's residence at the time of marriage, and she would be her friend for life. Their friendship would be sanctified right during the wedding ceremony. Once the ritual is done these two women would be called god-sisters/ god-friends, and would stand by each other through thick and thin. The festival of Karwa Chauth was initiated to celebrate the bond the women thus shared. The tradition to keep a fast for her husband was added later on, probably to enhance the significance of this festival, because 'husband' was the primary reason why these two women became friends for life.
The modern day purpose/ significance of this festival:
The festival of Karwa Chauth is celebrated to renew the bond married women and their god-friends share. However, today the purpose of celebrating this festival is predominantly focused on seeking blessings for well-being and prosperity of their husbands. Moreover, it provides an opportunity to the married women to get closer to their husband's family and their clique. In the northern and western parts of India, this festival has a remarkable social and cultural significance.
Preparations for the Puja
The preparations for Karwa Chauth start a few days in advance. Married women buy jewellery, make-up and other shringar items. On Karwa Chauth, they wear attractive and colourful saris or chunries, particularly in red, pink or other bridal colours. Also, they adorn themselves with all other symbols of a married women such as, nose pin, tika, bindi, chonp, bangles, earrings etc.
Karwa Chauth Food Items
Since the women have to keep a fast from sunrise to moonrise, food items are prepared and eaten before the sunrise.
Sargi, which includes pheni (a sweet made by using milk and semolina), parantha, and various types of fruits and sweets.
Ten matthis with an equal number of puas (a sweet made of jaggery)
Delicous halwa
Items needed to perform a Karwa Chauth puja:
Idol of Goddess Gauri (Parvati).
Karwa (pitcher) filled with water.
A diya (earthen lamp).
A beautifully decorated chalni (sieve).
Flowers.
A handful of fruits and food grains.
A puja thaali (dish) made of brass or stainless steel.
Incense sticks, kumkum (vermilion), chawal (rice).
Lota (container) filled with water.
A fancy tissue veil to cover the thali.
Karwa Chauth rituals:
During the day, women put henna/mehndi on their palms, decorate puja thali (dish) and visit friends and relatives. Later in the afternoon, women go to a temple or to someone's place who has organised the puja, in a circle with their puja thalis and an elderly lady or a pujarin narrates the legend/story of Karwa Chauth. While the story is being narrated, the women pass their thalis in the circle. Depending on the region and community, there are some variations in the rituals.
In Punjabi communities, the Karwa Chauth song is sung seven times, the first six of which describe some of the activities that are taboo during the fast and the seventh describes the lifting of those restrictions with the conclusion of the fast. The forbidden activities include weaving cloth (kumbh chrakhra feri naa), pleading with or attempting to please anyone (ruthda maniyen naa), and awakening anyone who is asleep (suthra jagayeen naa). In Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, the women exchange Karwas seven times between themselves. In Rajasthan, before offering water seven times the fasting woman is asked "Dhai?", to which she responds, "Suhaag na Dhai". In Rajasthan, stories are told by older women in the family, including narratives of Karwa Chauth, Shiv, Parvati, and Ganesh. In earlier times, an idol of Gaur Mata was made using earth and cow dung, which has now been replaced with an idol of Parvati. Each fasting woman lights an earthen lamp in her thali while listening to the Karva story. Kumkum, incense sticks and rice are also kept in the thali.
In Uttar Pradesh, a priest or an elderly woman of the family narrates the story of beejabeti or Veervati. Women make Gauri, Ganesh and Shankar idols with mud and decorate them with colourful and bright clothes and jewellery.

Why the Nasdaq is still getting hammeredWhy the Nasdaq is still getting hammered

The Nasdaq got hammered hard again Friday — making it the disproportionately large victim of the market’s selloff which worsened across the board.
Following a colossal 2%, 90.25-point smackdown in the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index Thursday, Friday is another horrific day for the ‘Naz. The Nasdaq crumbled another 102.10 points, or 2.3%, to 4276.24 Friday.
Friday’s tumble caps off a 4.5% decline for the week, the Nasdaq’s worst week since May 2012. And it’s a stunningly bad performance even while the rest of the market is falling. The Standard & Poor’s 500, in contrast, fell 1.2% Friday.
What’s wrong with the Nasdaq? On Friday, it was simple. Computer semiconductor stocks got hammered. Six of the 10 worst-performing Nasdaq 100 stocks Friday are all computer chip-related companies. The Nasdaq 100 is a collection of the most valuable non-financial stocks in the Nasdaq, therefore the stocks with the most sway on the index’ value.
Friday biggest Nasdaq loser on a percentage basis was NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) , which designs all sorts of computer chips. The stock fell $8, or 12.4%, to $56.34.
Chip stocks were the biggest culprits Friday, but not the only ones. Another top-10 Nasdaq loser of the day, which isn’t a computer chipmaking stock, is electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) . Shares fell $20.10, or 7.8%, to $236.01 after the company didn’t announce the mind-blowing self-driving car some investors had hoped for.
Below are the worst performing Nasdaq 100 stocks today on a percentage basis:

Volatility raises worries about retirement savingsA word of advice for investors worried about retirement savings
By: Nanci Hellmich October 10, 2014 1:48 pm
SHARE ON FACEBOOK

Many jittery investors are worried about their retirement savings given the recent volatility of the stock market. The Dow was down 273 points Tuesday, up 275 Wednesday and down 335 points Thursday.
“The market will have its ups and downs, but it’s important to stay the course,” says John Sweeney, Fidelity Investments’ executive vice president of retirement and investing strategies.
“While October gets a bad rap for having the most market declines, it’s important to look at the story the long term picture tells,” Sweeney says. “If you look at the S&P over a 20-year period, October had the second highest median return of any month — 1.76%.”
If you are five to 10 years from retirement, that’s a long period of time over which your portfolio can grow so you should be thinking about an equity portfolio that will outpace inflation, he says.
“Equities are higher risk but have higher expected returns over the long term and enable investors to earn returns that exceed inflation,” Sweeney says. Your other choices are cash, money markets, bonds. In today’s environment, bonds are not allowing your portfolio to grow at a rate that exceeds inflation, he says.
If you have a sum of money and are worried about investing it all today, take portions of it and invest it over a period of time so you are getting an average rate, buying more shares when they are less expensive and fewer shares when prices rise. You could invest it each month for the next six months or invest one quarter of it every month for four months, he says.
Exactly how much money you’ll need for retirement is complicated because there are so many variables, including your essential expenses (housing, food health care) and discretionary expenses (travel, clothes, entertainment, dining out). Everybody’s situation is going to be a little different. People often underestimate how long they are going to live. A quarter of us will live into our early 90s, so we are really planning for a retirement that could last 30 years or more.
Fidelity offers this rule of thumb: Save at least eight times your final salary to help increase the odds that you won’t outlive your savings during 30 years in retirement. This amount assumes that you’ll get some money from Social Security and that your expenses after you retire will be lower than when you were working. Higher net-worth folks usually need to save more than eight times their final salary.

Vishal Sikka brings 3 former SAP colleagues ...Infosys
(In addition to the 12 executive…)
BANGALORE: In addition to the 12 executive vice-presidents at Infosys, Sikka since taking over office on August 1 has brought three of his former SAP colleagues to Infosys to help him implement his new initiatives. Two of the three, Michael Reh and Navin Budhiraja were present when Sikka unveiled his strategy.
MICHAEL REH
FORMER: Executive VP for business information & tech nology at SAP
CURRENTLY: Senior VP at Infosys.
Earlier this week, Sikka tasked Michael Reh with the revival of Infosys' core banking product, Finacle, which had a poor second quarter.
Reh, who will be based out of Hamburg, Germany, will help Finacle increase its presence in mobile banking. Reh will also help expand the Finacle brand to include insurance, something which Mumbai-based TCS has done with its core banking product BaNCS.
Sikka has already said that he intends to double the company's investment in Finacle. "Michael (Reh) has worked in areas of mobile and cloud while at SAP," said an executive familiar with the matter.
SANJAY RAJAGOPALAN
FORMER: Head of Design, SAP
CURRENTLY: SVP Infosys
Sanjay Rajagopalan is to head the Design Thinking, a creative, user-centred approach to problemsolving and help the company implement it. Infosys has already started conducting large-scale classes for its leaders, including from consulting and sales team leaders.
Some of the classes are being conducted by professors from Stanford University's design school. Rajagopalan is also helping put together a large-scale design thinking training session for all Infosys employees at Mysore, and other development centres.
Rajagopalan is also trying to get design coach experts to make Infosys trainers learn the nuances of Design Thinking.
  NAVIN BUDHIRAJA
FORMER: Chief architect at SuccessFactors (bought by SAP)
CURRENTLY: SVP Infosys
Navin Budhiraja has not been given a role for now but ET learns that he will help Sikka implement the new technologies, including adoption of artificial intelligence and automation across the company.
To be based out of US, Budhiraja, according to executives familiar with the development, is to also help Infosys set up a centre of intelligence.

Before he became the second Indian to win the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, not many had heard Kailash Satyarthi’s name.
 
But within 90 minutes of the announcement, the child's rights activist had gained more than 4,500 followers on Twitter--and the list was growing at blazing speed.
 
The 60-year-old activist has been a relentless crusader of child rights and his organisation, the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), has been at the forefront of the drive against child labour in India for years.
Interview: 'The award will benefit the movement'
 
“It was a passion from my childhood to work for children, I carried it forward," said Satyarthi. “I have been very strongly advocating that poverty must not be used as an excuse to continue child labour. It perpetuates poverty. If children are deprived of education, they remain poor.”

Satyarthi was trained as an electrical engineer, but he began his work by staging raids on Indian manufacturing, rug-making and other plants where children and their parents often work as bonded labour.

The Bachpan Bachao Andolan, founded in 1980, has fought child labour by creating domestic and international consumer resistance to products made by bonded children, as well as with direct legal and advocacy work.
 
Building on his initial activism, Satyarthi organised the Global March Against Child Labor in the 1990s -- dedicated to freeing the millions of children abused worldwide in a form of modern slavery.
 
The activist is also founder of RugMark, a widely known international scheme that tags all carpets made in factories that are child-labour free.

In 1998, he organised the Global March Against Child Labour across 103 countries, which helped pave the way for an International Labor Organization convention on the worst forms of child labour.
 
He described the plight of children forced into the worst kinds of abusive work in a 2010 interview with the Robert F. Kennedy Centre for Justice and Human Rights.
 
"If they cry for their parents, they are beaten severely, sometimes hanged upside down from trees and even branded or burned with cigarettes," he said.
 
Satyarthi has said his social conscience was awoken when he was six and noticed a boy his age on the steps outside the school with his father, cleaning shoes.
Watch: 'Why I took up the cause of child rights'
Seeing many such children working instead of being educated, he felt an urge as he grew older to solve the problem -- launching him on his career of activism.
 
"I think of it all as a test. This is a moral examination that one has to pass. ... to stand up against such social evils," he said in the Kennedy Centre interview.
 
Through a number of training programmes, Satyarthi also helps children sold to pay off their parents' debts find new lives and serve as agents of prevention within their communities.
 
“The outstanding work that Mr Satyarthi has done over the past 35 years on child labour and trafficking has helped change mindsets and influence communities to protect children’s rights and create a more just society,” Deval Sanghavi, founder of Mumbai-based philanthropic organisation Dasra, told HT.
President Barack Obama on Friday congratulated Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai calling their Nobel “a victory for all who strive to uphold the dignity of every human being”.
Himself a Nobel peace laureate from 2009, Obama also said that despite their difference background, they share an “unshakeable belief in the basic dignity of every girl and boy”.

The Bachpan Bachao Andolan was initiated as a grassroot-level and direct-action-oriented people's movement in 1980 to eliminate exploitation of children, especially child labour and child trafficking. The campaign has over 80,000 individuals and 750 organisations as members, who advocate and act for the protection of child rights.
 
One of Satyarthi’s big achievements is the promotion of a consumer awareness campaign in Europe and the US aimed at dissuading consumers from buying carpets made by child labourers and simultaneously endorsing goods produced without exploiting children.
 
Satyarthi uses an array of techniques including lobbying with politicians and knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court, National Human Rights Commission and other judicial institutions for enforcement of child rights laws.

Centre interfering in State affairs, alleges Mamata

A day after the Union Home Ministry directed National Investigation Agency (NIA) to take over investigation in the “accidental” blast at Bardhaman district of West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday that there is an “increasing trend of interference” by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre in the matters of the State.
“I feel like sharing with my Facebook friends that ever since the new government has come to power at the Centre, there is an increasing trend of interference by the Central Government in the State matters,” the Chief Minister wrote on her Facebook page.
Accusing the Central Government of “frequently and unnecessarily” interfering in State matters, Ms. Banerjee said such interference “is not at all expected” as per the Constitution.
“The beauty of federal structure is the jurisdiction of working between the Centre and the State,” Ms. Banerjee said and added: “Primarily, the role of the Central Government is to deal with matters concerning major policies/decision making issues. It is expected that Centre and the States do not encroach upon the areas of activities of others.” Ms. Banerjee further said that the Central Government is acting like a “political party” rather than a national government.
She also alleged that with the “active support” of the Central Government “controversial matters” are aired in electronic media like “Doordarshan and private channels” resulting in “communal tension in different States”.
In the post, the Chief Minister made no reference to the NIA probe in the Bardhaman blast, but the remarks are being made at a time when her party colleagues were opposing the probe by the Central agency.

Malala Yousafzai s improbable journey to Nobel Peace PrizeBIRMINGHAM, England, October 11, 2014

Malala Yousafzai's improbable journey to Nobel Peace Prize
AP
Reuters Malala Yousafzai became a symbol for the struggle for women’s rights in Pakistan.
SLIDESHOW
education
Malala Yousafzai celebrated her Nobel Peace Prize where she always wished to be — in school.
The Pakistani girl, once shot by the Taliban for daring to want an education just like the boys, celebrated being the joint winner of the peace prize on Friday with her classmates at Edgbaston High School for girls in Birmingham, the city in central England that she now calls home.
The teenager had travelled to Birmingham for medical treatment after being targeted by the Taliban for her relentless objections to the group’s regressive interpretation of Islam that limits girls’ access to education. She was shot while returning home from school in Pakistan’s scenic Swat Valley two years ago, almost to the day.
“This award is for all those children who are voiceless, whose voices need to be heard,” she said at a press conference at Birmingham’s Library. “I speak for them and I stand up with them. And I join them in their campaign.”
She said it was an honour for her to share the prize with Kailash Satyarthi of India, 60, who has spent a lifetime working against child slavery and exploitation. She also invited the Prime Ministers of both India and Pakistan to attend the Nobel awards ceremony.
Ms. Malala’s case won worldwide recognition, and the teen, now 17, became a symbol for the struggle for women’s rights in Pakistan. In an indication of her reach, she spoke before the United Nations and made the shortlist for Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” for 2012.
But the journey was simply improbable.
On Oct. 9, 2012, Ms. Malala climbed into the back of a small pick-up truck used to transport Swat Valley children home from school. They laughed and talked as the truck rumbled over roads lined with pot holes.
As they approached a narrow bridge over a garbage-strewn stream, a masked man with a gun suddenly stopped the truck. Another man with a pistol jumped into the back.
“Who is Malala?” he shouted.
The girls did not answer but heads automatically swivelled toward her. The man raised his pistol. One bullet hit Ms. Malala on the top of her head . Two other students were also hit, less seriously.
Ms. Malala was transferred to a military hospital near Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, as her head swelled dangerously. Her father, Ziauddin, was certain that his daughter would not survive the night. He sent a message to his brother-in-law in Swat to prepare a coffin.
Pakistani doctors removed a bullet that entered her head and travelled toward her spine before she was flown to Britain for more specialized brain trauma care. She woke up a week later at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England.
She says she regained consciousness with one thought — “Thank God I’m not dead.”
Ms. Malala gradually regained her sight and her voice. She was reunited with her parents. Soon there were pictures, stuffed animals at her side. She sent messages to well-wishers.
Three months later she walked out of the hospital , smiling shyly as she cautiously strode down the corridor.
“She is quite well and happy on returning home as we all are,” her father told The Associated Press at the time.
Pakistan made Ms. Malala’s father its education attache in Birmingham for at least three years, giving the family stability and Ms. Malala a safe place to go to school.
She went back to school as soon as she could, and confessed that math was her least favourite subject. She kept campaigning for the rights of children to go to school meeting President Barack Obama, attending rights conferences, becoming the keynote speaker at corporate events in London. She began rubbing elbows with people who had the power and the money to help her realize her dreams.
All along, she delighted many by simply being young, determined and most of all, herself.
At a Vodafone conference celebrating women, she confided that she didn’t have a mobile phone. The crowd gasped, but chuckled at the notion of a teenager who admitted she had no need for a phone.
With British journalist Christina Lamb, she co-authored a memoir, “I am Malala,” which revealed to the world that she was, in fact, also a regular teenager. There’s a part of her that loves the TV show “Ugly Betty” whose main character works at a fashion magazine. She likes pop star Justin Bieber, watches the television cooking show “Master Chef”.
And on Friday, the people who helped her on the journey and those just touched by her story along the way couldn’t help but be swept up by the magic of it all.
“Malala is an inspiration for the many women in Afghanistan and Pakistan who have been fighting for their rights and struggling against the misogynous policies of the Taliban and local warlords,” said David Cortright, co-author of “Afghan Women Speak” and a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. “As we know, people learn best from personal stories. Malala’s story is a powerful antidote to extremist propaganda, and the Nobel Prize reinforces its impact.”
Doctors in Birmingham offered congratulations, noting her focus and dedication. And the people of the city that threw its arms out to welcome her simply nodded their heads — No surprise at this news. She’s liked here, well known. Ms. Malala has embraced the city, proudly describing herself as a “Brummie” like other locals.
“Sure, puts a bit of pride into it,” said John Mullan, 78, an aluminium worker and resident of Birmingham, said on Friday after the Nobel Prize news. “She’s just young girl who stood up to them. Many other people wouldn’t have done that.”
Ms. Malala remains determined to return to Pakistan one day and enter politics. In Birmingham on Friday, her growing polish was clear. She spoke from the heart in three languages, offering an almost uncanny combination of a teenager with a vision and a diplomat with a platform.
She did need a box though, so that she could be seen over the podium. A small concession, but necessary to be heard.
She will split the peace prize’s $1.1 million cash award with co-winner Mr. Satyarthi. Ms. Malala said the joint prize gives a message that the people of both countries and people who are Hindu and Muslim can work together.
“We support each other,” she said.
But what everyone wanted to know was — how did she learn the news? How did a 17-year-old who just received the world’s highest honour react after being pulled out of chemistry.
“I felt really honoured,” she said with a schoolgirl gush. There was probably some jumping up and down, but she didn’t mention that.
Then she turned around and rejoined the other girls. She was back in time for physics.

Snowden, girlfriend reunited in Moscow, new documentary shows
Reuters
espionage and intelligence
Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who blew the whistle on the U.S. government's mass surveillance programmes, has been reunited in Russia with his long-time girlfriend, a new documentary shown on Friday revealed.
Lindsay Mills, who was living with Snowden when he left Hawaii for Hong Kong in May 2013, joined him in Moscow in July 2014, the documentary "Citizenfour" disclosed in a surprise revelation.
The two are filmed cooking together in an apartment in Moscow, where Snowden has been living since he was given temporary asylum and later a three-year residency permit.
Mills had remained silent and her whereabouts were largely unknown after Snowden's release of tens of thousands of classified U.S. intelligence documents in 2013.
"Citizenfour," made by film maker Laura Poitras, had its world premiere at the New York film festival on Friday.
It gives a fly-on-the wall account of Snowden's tense days in a Hong Kong hotel and his encounters with journalists from the Washington Post and Britain's Guardian newspaper as they prepared to divulge details of NSA programmes that gathered data from the Internet activities and the phones of millions of ordinary Americans and dozens of world leaders.

Third-time lucky Chhota Rajans brother hopes for win with BJP helpComments
He is a real estate developer by profession, has produced a Bollywood movie, and is part of Ramdas Athawale-led Republican Party of India (RPI). But many know Deepak Nikalje, 47, as the brother of fugitive gangster Chhota Rajan.
Nikalje, who lives in a 5,000 sqft bungalow and drives an Audi, is making his third attempt to become a legislator, this time with the support of the BJP.  He is contesting from Chembur assembly, which has a mixed population of Maharashtrians, south Indians, and Sindhis.
There are 10 candidates in the fray, but the contest is between former minister and Congress candidate Chandrakant Handore, Shiv Sena corporator candidate Prakash Phatarpekar and Nikalje.
Nikalje, who has consciously stayed away from the world of crime, claims all he is asked about is his brother. “Is it a crime to be someone’s brother?” he said.
Fondly called ‘bhau’ by his supporters, Nikalje is soft spoken and doesn’t like to talk much even during campaigning.
“Bhau will win this time,” said one of his supporters, during a rally in Mahul village on Wednesday night. They are confident that the BJP’s support will help him sail through.
Even Nikalje is confident of his victory. “BJP leaders Hashu Advani and Pramod Shirvalkar have represented Chembur constituency for a long time. This time the BJP and RPI are allies, and there are many RPI and Ambedkar supporters in the area,” he said.
According to Nikalje, residents of Chembur are grappling with several issues such as bad roads, water supply, poor drainage system, slum redevelopment, among others. “Pollution is also a major concern. I am going to focus on it and promote planting of trees,” he said. However, there are factors that may go against the leader — division of Dalit votes, his family background, lack of familiarity in the constituency — say political analysts.

ISL hopes to wake sleeping football giant IndiaNew league hopes to wake 'sleeping' soccer giant India

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's new soccer league with its cast of celebrity owners, experienced foreign managers and a sprinkling of high-profile players will kick off on Sunday, igniting hopes of waking the country from its football slumber.
Italian World Cup winners Alessandro Del Piero and Marco Materazzi, Spain's Joan Capdevila and Luis Garcia, and French stars David Trezeguet and Robert Pires have all signed up to play in the Indian Super League.
Cricket-obsessed India, with its population of 1.2 billion, is ranked 158th in the world, leading FIFA President Sepp Blatter to call it the 'sleeping giant' of world football.
The national league has failed to inspire youngsters to take up the sport, which remains popular only in certain areas of the country, while the appetite to watch televised games is restricted to the English Premier League or Spain's La Liga.
Modelled on cricket's popular Indian Premier League, the ISL, with its franchise-based model, slick promotion and branding, and the presence of stars from cricket and the country's film industry, is aiming to change all that.
"Indian football had somewhat stagnated," All India Football Federation (AIFF) Vice President Subrata Dutta told Reuters recently.
"Nothing great was happening and we were not progressing at the desirable rate. We have been hovering between 140 and 160 in rankings for many years now and we needed something big to push us forward.
"We at the AIFF felt that an explosion is needed in Indian football. We felt the ISL would give the necessary push to Indian football, it would make a difference."
GLAMOUR, ENTERTAINMENT
Bankrolled by India's Reliance Industries, Rupert Murdoch's Star India and sports management group IMG, the ISL has welcomed former cricket greats Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, as well as current captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, among the team owners.
In addition to the veteran players, the competition will also see former international coaches Zico, Peter Reid and Ricki Herbert in a managerial capacity.
In its inaugural season, the ISL will feature eight city-based franchises taking part in the Oct. 12-Dec. 20 tournament.
There will be lots of glamour and entertainment on display during Sunday's opening ceremony in Kolkata.
The match between Atletico de Kolkata, owned by a consortium including Spanish champions Atletico Madrid, and Mumbai City FC is expected to draw more than 100,000 people at Salt Lake Stadium, the world's second-largest by capacity at 120,000.
The tournament, to be played in a round-robin format, will then move around the country to the seven other cities.
The top four sides will qualify for the semi-finals, which will be played over two legs, with the winners advancing to a one-off final.
While the inaugural season will have a novelty factor and has all the ingredients to be a commercial success, critics believe it will be the quality and intensity of play that will be crucial in sustaining the appeal.
Promoters and teams have promised to make an investment towards developing standards in India and according to Spain's Capdevila, who will line up for North East United FC, that is exactly what the country needs to make a significant difference.
"The ISL is a good start," said the defender, who was part of Spain's Euro 2008 and 2010 World Cup winning sides.
"Two and half months is not enough time so it will be better if the period of the league is increased to like nine months in future," he told Reuters last month.
"It's a new baby but what India needs is grass-roots development to grow into a footballing power."

Nadella gaffe fuels debate on women in tech ...Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gaffe fuels debate on women in tech world
Seema Sirohi, ET Bureau Oct 11, 2014, 04.23AM IST

CEO
(Nadella's comments came…)
WASHINGTON: Women should depend on "good karma" and "the system" and not ask for pay raises. This bit of advice by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, a man smart enough to know better, has created an angry storm in the tech world, which his quick apology has done little to calm.
Reactions have ranged from outright anger at Nadella's apparent 19th century outlook to pop psychoanalysis about how his "inner Indian" finally surfaced, that too at a conference to celebrate women's contributions in the digital world.
Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, the largest grassroots organisation in the United States, told ETthat what Nadella "has just done is to completely demolish the credibility of Microsoft" to increase the number of women in its workforce. "What he is saying is, "Little ladies, just hang back and let us, the men, take care of you."
Nadella was the keynote speaker at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, the largest annual gathering of women technologists. His audience expected him to be aware of the gender gap in pay and show the forward path.
Instead, Nadella gave a convoluted and confused answer to a direct question on how young women should go about asking for a pay raise because it is a well-established fact that unlike men, women don't demand salary raises as often.
He said that not asking for a raise can be "one of the additional superpowers that, quite frankly, women who don't ask for a raise have. Because that's good karma. It'll come back because somebody's going to know that's the kind of person that I want to trust. That's the kind of person that I want to really give more responsibility to. And in the longterm efficiency, things catch up."
Remarks Unlikely to be Forgotten
In Nadella's Microsoft, women are, therefore, advised to bide their time and wait patiently to be recognised because "good karma" will finally prevail. Unsurprisingly, his words crashed like a tidal wave on the combined consciousness of WWF - the women's work force. The blogosphere lit up with instant reaction with some of the most biting commentary coming from card-carrying members of his own gender. The message: get with the programme.
He did and offered an apology: "I answered that question completely wrong. Without a doubt I wholeheartedly support programs at Microsoft and in the industry that bring more women into technology and close the pay gap. I believe men and women should get equal pay for equal work."
  The complete about-face may have tided him over for now but his initial remarks are unlikely to be forgotten. What he said is likely a closer reflection of this thinking than an apology by his PR team. If he had asked his women employees, he would have found out that technology companies are difficult places for women and minorities because they are dominated by White and Asian males.
Warwick Business School's Professor of Business Ethics, Marianna Fotaki, said: "...women cannot and should not wait for the enlightened bosses to grant them the salary they have earned. They have to be proactive in asking for a pay increase and learn how to successfully conduct such negotiations in order to change their predicament. If many women do this, it might also put an end to the illconceived advice about their own destiny and change the terms of the debate."
Janet E Blake, a Dynamics AX developer, wrote an open letter to Nadella with this statistical revelation: "Men who hold graduate or professional degrees earn a whopping 73% more than women with the same educational qualifications" as per Joint Venture Silicon Valley.
In the world of medicine, female doctors get only 71% of what male doctors get while on Wall Street, the gap is wider with women making only 66%. Nadella's remarks show how long a road it still is for women.

Starting Friday night, nearly 100 policemen will be on city’s streets on night patrol in an effort to prevent crime. They will be in addition to the number of policemen and officers already on duty.
According to Pravesh Kumar, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Law and Order, Coimbatore City Police, as per the instructions of Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, the police had decided to divide into two or three beats the 15 police stations in the city for night rounds by two police personnel—in the ranks of sub inspectors or senior sub inspectors, head constables or constables. The personnel on duty would be in touch with the City Police Control Room and Station House Officers (inspector) to report on crime and ask for reinforcements, if necessary.
The night beats would start around 10 p.m. and go on till 6 a.m.
Mr. Kumar said that this was not a Deepavali-specific measure but nevertheless the beats would cover the festive season and continue thereafter as well.
As for Deepavali, he said that the City Police had installed barricades in shopping areas for easy movement of pedestrians as well as vehicles. The shoppers could also shop with a sense of security as the police had deployed men in plain clothes equipped with a dossier of ex-convicts and habitual criminals. This was in addition to watchtowers erected on Oppanakara Street, Cross Cut Road and a few other areas and installation of closed-circuit television cameras.
The CCTV cameras installed in shopping hubs are also monitored by police personnel.

You can be a MasterChef at home0
pizza
The current season of MasterChef Australia is as eye-poppingly wondrous as it is depressing. Eye-poppingly wondrous because of the quality of technique shown by the contestants, who are only but home cooks; and depressing because one would tend to question if he or she could be able to do the same in their own homes (the answer, after all, is overwhelmingly negative).
 
But thankfully, there is a way you can be a MasterChef at home. With a little interest andknowledge, natural curiosity and healthy taste buds (and nasal function), you can shed your home cook garb and don the MasterChef apron in your own homes.
 
Chef Bakul, chef extraordinaire of California Pizza Kitchen, spoke to us recently about how he believes one can conquer the kitchen in true MasterChef style. "Yes," he exclaims, "a regular home cook can replicate as well as create MasterChef dishes in the comfort of their home kitchens. India is a land of spices and great flavours. We could come up with our very own signature dishes with combinations that become huge hits with Indian and foreign palates alike."
 
But what is the meaning of a "Masterchef cuisine", we wonder. "MasterChef cuisine is a term coined to cater to all senses," he says. "The growing trend of master classes and inspired dishes has given birth to a whole new aspect in the culinary sphere. The cuisine aims at delivering a personal touch to dishes and this is seen in the plating and in subtle combinations of new flavours and textures."
 
No wonder the show, whether theAustralian, American or Indian version ishugely popular in India. "The popularity of the show is due to the fact that experimentation has been given a new edge and the portrayal of cooking made challenging and competitive drives audiences to try new dishes as well as replicate the samedishes the contestants and chefs create. The MasterChef Kitchen, pantry, ingredients and participants make the show a raging success," he smiles.
 
However, all this talk does not help us don the MasterChef apron, so we ask chef to give us an example of how a regular meal in an Indian household can be MasterChef-ied.
 
So over the top of his head, he says, "I would probably toss a pasta with Kerala Meen Moilee curry and serve it with mildly spiced crisp fried fish fillets, garnished with salad of onion rings, fried curry leaves and cucumber dressed with a sweet chilli cilantro dressing. The ultimate dish should have a marriage of all flavours which should complement each other well. For drink,  I would serve a deconstructed Panak, a peppery jaggery drink which is made of jaggery, cardamom, peppercorns, grated ginger and  lemon juice. Served with crystallized ginger and lemon wheel."
 
WHOA!
 
Doable? Possibly. But definitely not for the faint-hearted. Or for those who equate entering the kitchen with painful Monday mornings.
 
For those of you who read the above, pursed your lips and thought, "Hmm, no biggie," here's a recipe from Chef Bakul that you can make at home. Try it out:

Bang Bang: The adventures of Jumping JackSpecial Arrangement A still from "Bang Bang!"
TOPICS
Hindi cinema
The K-words are in demand this week. If Vishal Bhardwaj’s Haider dares to tackle Kashmir in a new light, Siddharth Anand’s Bang Bang, which is being promoted through the ‘do you dare’ campaign, resorts to the safety of the good-old Kohinoor to put together a heist story that is driven by clichés and stereotypes. Early in the film, Danny, playing a ganglord offers a valiant officer (Jimmy Sheirgill) pizza with extra cheese as his last wish. As the film progresses one realises the cheesy offer was the sign of things to come.
An official remake of Tom Cruise’s “Knight And Day”, it is all sound and style with a shallow core and makes no bones about it. Siddharth knows who he is catering to and goes all out. The makers have put some sensible minds like Abbas Tyrewala and Sujoy Ghosh to lend some substance to the flimsy script and they do the job of keeping the mind of the target audience away from the fact that the script is just an excuse for placing products that Hrithik and Katrina endorse, and in between slip into some spectacular stunts to justify the big budget. They have sewn the holes with as much care as Hrithik stiches his bullet wounds in the film. A throwback to the ’70s it shows that a section of Bollywood is only investing in shooting budgets.
The leap of faith expects us to believe that Dehradun experiences heavy snow fall. Perhaps the director feels that the only thing worth competing with in “Haider” is snow.
Genre: Action/ Romance Director: Siddharth Anand Cast: Hrithik Roshan, Katrina Kaif, Danny Denzongpa, Javed Jaffery, Jimmy Sheirgill Bottomline:A festive treat for adolescents in all age groups.
It pretends to get serious when Hrithik decides to settle scores with Katrina. She gave him a lecture on living in the moment in “Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara”. It is his turn to return the favour on the importance of ek din.
What saves the film is its comic book tone which should appeal to the kids. Made in “Ek Tha Tiger” kind of space, where the lead players don’t take themselves too seriously, the dialogues become unintentionally funny and the inside jokes keep the narrative from falling into a rut.
The casting of Katrina Kaif as the damsel in distress saved by the hero seems like a masterstroke but she is no Cameron Diaz. Playing a dumb belle also requires acting talent but Kaif continues to be the book that wants to be judged by its cover or the Barbie doll that wants to be judged by her smile.
The action sequences are truly spectacular and finally Hrithik Roshan has got a film that matches the scale of his larger than life persona. Unlike Kaif, Hrithik gels with the tone and it is hard to take one’s eyes off him.
So it seems implausible to see him as a thief without disguises but it is not a film to ask hows and whys. It is the kind of film where you sit back and count his abs, his miraculous jumps and pick destinations to visit next summer.
Towards the end, the movie is reduced to ‘drag-drag’, but by then it has done enough to give the already festive audience something to cheer about.

Telenor open to mergers and acquisitions, finds Indian laws discouraging

(Baksaas said that the Indian…)
NEW DELHI: A top executive of Norwegian telecom firm Telenor has said the company is open to merger and acquisitions in India but the country's rules don't encourage it. Telenor's chief executive Jon Fredrik Baksaas , who is in India to review the progress of the company's Indian unit, Uninor, also urged the government to release more spectrum.
"In India, only a portion of the available spectrum has been distributed for commercial purposes, and this is rare if you compare it to other countries, which are distributing more or less at 100% for commercial usage. This (distribution of more spectrum) needs to be speeded up," Baksaas told ET during an exclusive interaction.
He added that the Indian government should not charge hefty upfront payments from the industry on account of airwaves but should allow the industry to grow, which would bring higher profitability and, in turn, mean more taxes for the government.
India's telecom sector is one of the most regulated industries where cost of airwaves is far higher than that for its international counterparts. The industry has been demanding lower base prices for airwaves, such that it can take telephony and data services to people countrywide.
Uninor provides 2G services in its six circles but needs to take a decision soon on how to address the issue of data growth in India, given that it doesn't have 3G spectrum and 4G is still a long way from a broader adoption.
"We need to address the transition to data...We are not there as of today," Baksaas said, indicating that the company could try to win spectrum in the 900 Mhz band in the upcoming auctions.
He, however, said competition would be tough as incumbent operators would bid aggressively to buy back their bandwidth, which will be put up for sale as permits are expiring.
Telenor bought liberalised spectrum in the 1,800 Mhz band, which can be used for offering highspeed wireless internet services on 4G. However, the ecosystem is yet to develop and at the same time other carriers are expanding their 3G networks. Uninor doesn't have 900 Mhz spectrum, which can be used for 3G services.
"It's tough to leapfrog from 2G to 4G. In theory, it could be done, but remember, 2G handsets need to be exchanged for 4G handsets. It happens over a period of time," Baksaas said.
He added that the Indian arm of Telenor is a long-term investor in India and will explore all options for growth here. Baksaas said he hoped 50% of Telenor's customer base by 2017 would be active internet users.
The Telenor chief said that in the longer term, there are three very strong players in the Indian telecom market, referring to Bharti Airtel , Vodafone and Idea Cellular . "Our ambition is to climb underneath them from where we are in our six circles in the medium term," he said.
On M&A, Baksaas said some discussions had happened in India but nothing has materialised. "There are probably still details to be addressed (in the M&A) policy.
And those details, if they aren't clarified, you won't see consolidation." Having begun operations in 2009, Baksaas said the company was "at ease in terms of doing business" in India, compared to about five years ago.
"The new government has brought in a lot of enthusiasm for international investors like us and we would like the government to follow up with concrete actions, including making more spectrum available which will help us cater to Indian citizens at affordable prices and help fulfill the Digital India project," he said.

Sun Pharma rapped for lax in follow-up of re...FDA
(The inspectors chided the…)
NEW DELHI: India's top drug maker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries has received a rap from the United States regulator for being lax in monitoring the follow-up corrective actions for the drugs it recalled from the US market early this year.
The company has not put in place a proper formalised corrective and preventive action plan for the diabetes drug (Metformin extended release) it recalled, the US Food & Drug Administration investigators noted after inspecting Sun Pharma's Halol plant in Gujarat last month, according to a copy of form 483 reviewed by ET. The form is used by the FDA to document concerns discovered during its inspections.
The company failed in the requisite measures despite telling the US government that "all the (corrective) actions (related to Metformin drug recall) have been implemented", the investigators added. Similarly, the company did not put in place any formal corrective plans for anxiety drug Venlafaxine Hydrochloride extended release tablets, for which it initiated a recall four months ago, the inspectors noted.
They further noted that the building used in the manufacturing of a drug product "is not maintained in a good state of repair". "For example, on September 8, 2014 we observed water stains with ceiling damage and on September 12, 2014 we observed water leaks from the ceiling in the personnel corridor of the parenteral manufacturing area," the team of FDA investigators Parul Patel, Daniel Roberts and Thomas Arista noted.
These are part of 23 adverse observations that the investigators have made in three separate categories - unit for making solid drugs (tablets, capsules), parenteral drugs (injectables, intravenous products) and the quality control lab.
A Sun Pharma spokesperson refused to comment on the matter. Analysts who have reviewed the document felt the chances of the US FDA blocking imports from the plant are slim but do not rule out future product approvals from the plant getting blocked. This could adversely impact the company's growth prospects in the US.
"There are no data integrity issues in the form and therefore chances of import alert are low. However, observations include several procedural issues where arresolution could take time and till then approvals could be blocked possibly," Anubhav Aggarwal of brokerage Credit Suisse said in a report.
This will impact the company's growth since its fastest growing division has been the US sales from the Indian plants, said the report, which estimated that the facility accounted for about 20-25% of the company's profits.
Another Gujarat-based plant of Sun Pharma at Karkhadi was banned from shipping to the US early this year.
The FDA investigators also objected to the practice of four-five individuals accessing sensitive production equipment through a common password. "There is no document to describe role and responsibilities of system administrators for the production equipment, no record to document the individuals who have access to production equipment," says the form 483.
The inspectors chided the firm for not documenting alarm events that occur during the routine tablet compression, among other observations.
Facilities of leading Indian drug makers including Ranbaxy (which Sun is in the process of acquiring) and Wockhardt were blacklisted by the US regulator last year. The FDA has been intensifying scrutiny on companies in India, the second-largest supplier of generic drugs to the country.
The drug regulator has said it will increase its activity in India as the country is the source for more than 40% of generics and over-the-counter drugs used in the US.

Smart City: Modi s Rs 78K cr GIFT hits roadb...Ahmedabad
(The Gujarat government…)
NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government has ambitious plans to build 100 smart cities, but the first smart city that the Gujarat government had embarked on under then chief minister Modi in 2007 — the Rs 78,000 crore GIFT city is caught in red tape at the Centre, threatening its viability due to incomplete buildings, lack of power utility lines and most importantly, the absence of corporate tenants who were expected to populate it.
The Gujarat government has approached the Centre, now firmly under its previous boss' grip, to push long-pending clearances from the ministries of finance, highways and civil aviation, for the Gujarat International Finance Tec (GIFT) City so that its first phase can meet its 2014 deadline.
A 50:50 joint venture between a state government undertaking and Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (ILFS) Limited, GIFT city was planned as a global financial and IT services hub spread over 886 acres near Ahmedabad airport and is expected to create a million direct and indirect jobs.
Though the project was allowed to set up a multi-services special economic zone with an international financial services centre in 2011, not a single financial institution is ready to set up shop at the city yet, said officials, as the government is yet to issue any regulatory norms on carrying out operations within the financial services centre.
"We wanted GIFT City to be comparable to other global financial hubs like Shanghai, Tokyo and London, but not a single financier is ready to book space in the city due to the lack of norms. We have repeatedly requested both the finance and commerce ministries to notify some regulations for such operations, without which existing capacity isn't being utilised while further development of the project is hindered," said a state government official aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
The state has now urged the urban development ministry to intervene for an early resolution of the hiccups faced by the GIFT city. The ministry, in turn, has escalated the case to the project monitoring group set up in the cabinet secretariat to expedite stalled investment projects and the project's issues are now under examination, officials said. One of the biggest roadblock faced by GIFT City, is the aviation ministry's reluctance to grant height clearances most of the tall buildings expected to tower the city's length and breadth. This has thwarted construction work on most of its flagship towers being built in the first phase.
"The Airports Authority of India has only granted permission to build towers upto 191 metres above the mean sea level. At this height, 47 of the 110 buildings, including its biggest towers, cannot progress," the official quoted earlier said. The tallest of the 110 buildings that are part of the masterplan, named Diamond Tower, is expected to rise up to 410 metres, while two other towers would be over 350 metres tall.
GIFT City had requested the airport authority, which is also in charge of air space navigation services and related clearances in India, to grant it a height clearance for buildings upto 476 metres. Similarly, the National Highways Authority of India has been hesitant about granting permission to lay power cables to light up the City's infrastructure.

Lawyers take protest into court hall
Special Correspondent

A section of lawyers in Madras High Court Bench here intensified their agitation demanding allotment of more number of judges by staging a sit-in protest inside Court Hall-2, presided over by administrative judge Justice V. Dhanapalan and Justice V.M. Velumani on Friday.
The bar members raised slogans inside the court hall seeking early redressal of their grievances. They also conducted their general body meeting in the hall, after the judges retired to their chambers, and passed a resolution to continue the protest by inviting lawyers from various Bar associations in the southern districts.
Earlier, they blocked the main entrance of the High Court and refused to allow staff, police personnel, litigants and others from entering the premises between 9.30 a.m. and 11.30 am. While some of the staff managed to enter the campus through the judges’ entrance, others got stranded on road. The Registry arranged a van to transport the stranded employees through a passage on the rear side of the court buildings.
After two hours of demonstration at the main entrance, the lawyers marched into Court Hall-2 and discussed the issue with Mr. Justice Dhanapalan. The judge told them that Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul was determined that a decision could be taken only if they returned to court work. It was not right on the part of lawyers to hold sit-in protest inside a court hall, he said.
However, the lawyers justified their act by stating that they were protesting on behalf of thousands of litigants whose cases were not being heard owing to lack of adequate number of judges. They also pointed out that recently a sitting judge of a High Court had walked into a court hall in Chennai to record his protest.

Excited about PM Modi s  Digital India  initiative: Mark ZuckerbergYou are here: Home > Collections > Facebook
I am excited about PM Narendra Modi's 'Digital India' initiative: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg
ET Bureau Oct 10, 2014, 01.51AM IST
(India has always been good…)
Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook who is visiting India, is on a mission to get more and more Indians online. In his keynote address, Zuckerberg talked about how he plans to get millions of Indians online. During an interaction, he also talked about net neutrality, starting up, privacy and meeting Prime Minister Modi. Edited Excerpts:
On meeting Modi
The thing I am really excited about is the Prime Minister's whole Digital India initiative. We're just this one company. We can't create connectivity around the world by ourselves so we're primarily trying to go and work with the folks like operators who're already trying to find a model to build out their network or governments trying to get their whole population online. There are probably things that we can probably help out with uniquely, but I am also going to be listening to try and figure out what we can do on that.
On WhatsApp and Facebook integration
Over the long term, I think we have a pretty clear model for building businesses around messaging products. You can look at, for example, some of the Chinese messaging products. Tencent's WeChat has been wildly successful as a business. So I think there are models that you can look at. For the near future, probably the next few years, we're really most focused on just trying to help connect people and help more people use the service.
On privacy
The biggest thing that we do is focus on building this product with different tools in it so that people can control exactly who sees each piece of the content they're sharing. That's one of the most powerful things about Facebook. If you want to share something publicly you can do that. In case if someone is doing something that isn't what they want, then it doesn't help them, it doesn't help us, and it's just not good for anyone. So the biggest thing that we do is really in the product. It's less about policy and we roll out product improvements across the whole world. It's really important, especially for us, now that we understand the cultural nuances here.
On starting up again
Right now, you'd focus on mobile. When I got started, it was mostly computers, and mobile wasn't as big a thing. You know, I myself use a phone way more than a computer these days. I mean I write all my emails on phones, and when we had our IPO I wrote my PS1 letters (on them)... so definitely phone today. I think video is a huge thing that's going to grow over the next few years, and I would just look for those openings. So where are there types of media, and sets of people that people don't have tools to share with, and someone will build something for those, whether it's us or someone else.
On why India
When the benefits of this technology are shared with society, we can start to make a big leapfrog. India has always been good in taking these leaps. Because of green revolution, hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty.
How you have embraced computer revolution — you have some of the best computer engineers in the world. Just last month, India became the first country in Asia to send a prototype to Mars. It's a huge technical achievement. The next generation has the opportunity to bring India to the world and bring the world to India. And a big opportunity is to embrace internet.
  On the three barriers to connectivity
The first is infrastructure. For 10-15% of population, the primary barrier is the technical barrier because majority of people do not live within range of a 3G network. So most of these people live in very remote areas. They also do not have other infrastructure like roads. There are more than 6,00,000 villages in India that face these challenges. Today, more than 85% of people already live within range of an existing network. For them, the primary challenge is economic.
Around two and half billion people live on less than a dollar a day. So even though phones are getting cheaper, it is still not affordable for these people. In the US, one model we talk about from time to time is that you can always call 911. In India, you can dial 100 to access the police. There needs to be a 911 for the internet where even if you haven't bought a data plan or can't afford that, you can get free access to some basic services for health, education, jobs, communications and some really important basic needs.
On local languages
The last barrier to connectivity is the availability of local language content. Today, more than 80% of the content on the internet is in just 10 languages. For developing countries, especially in Asia and Africa, a lot of people just aren't well represented online, especially in their local languages. In India, there are 22 official languages and 11 scripts and there are 100s of other unofficial languages.

Suits & sayings: Meeting Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg
ET Bureau Oct 10, 2014, 02.21AM IST
(ET’s bi-weekly roundup…)
ET's bi-weekly roundup of the wackiest whispers and murmurs in corporate corridors & policy parlours.
Meeting Zuck
Zuck is in India and CEOs just have to meet him. Mark Zuckerberg's Delhi engagement on Thursday was THE EVENT in the city and business notables who were not invited are nursing a sense of pain that's as intense as it is difficult to admit to in public. One CEO of a telecom company took seven calls in half an hour on Thursday morning, with his peers asking him (a) whether he was invited (b) whether he knew they were invited and (c) whether he knew who all have not been invited. This CEO, who did get that precious invitation, was a little fed up by it all. But then, he could afford to be - he got to meet Zuck.
Sales vs Marketing
Online retailers' deep discounting and their ability to sell older model consumer products briskly have not only made brick and mortar retail nervous. E-retail's biz model has also produced a rare tension between sales and marketing teams in many consumer product companies. Sales teams are delighted that inventories are reducing, while marketing guys are fuming that brisk sales seem to be happening without any effort on part of them. If the Flipkarts and Amazons carry on as they are, CEOs of consumer product companies better be ready to mediate in major intracompany battles.
Mumbai's Bong vs Bong
One has the glamour quotient from Bollywood, the other the first citizens of India Inc. One has the beautiful people of North Mumbai, the other the cream from SoBo. Every year, the Mukherjees of Juhu vie with Bong CEOs of Cumballah Hill. The prize? The honour of being perceived as the force behind the most blue chip Durga Puja of Mumbai. This year was no different. From Koushik Chatterjee of Tata Steel to veteran rainmaker Udayan Bose to former SCI boss SC Hajra, the corporate attendance at blue chip pujas was at its fullest. But unlike in some other cases, this north-south divide is not hostile and a few like SBI's Arundhati Bhattacharya braved the mile long traffic to visit both venues.
Where's Banka?
Where's Aditya Birla Private Equity's ex-boss, Bharat Banka? Mumbai's close-knit PE circles are talking of little else than Banka suddenly falling off the grid. How can a man known to be a close confidante of group chairman Kumarmangalam Birla suddenly go off the radar, PE types are asking. Banka's job went to the group's corporate finance head D Muthukumaran after a reshuffle at the top. But Banka, we hear, will be back with a bang. A bigger job profile is soon to be announced, we are told. Makes sense then to keep a low profile for now.
Promotions? No!
This is truly strange - sarkari babus refusing promotions. Engineers at Central Public Works Department, that muchreviled organization tasked with building national highways, don't really want promotions because the mantri, Nitin Gadkari, is setting tough targets for senior engineers. This is sarkari work ethic for you - rather let go seniority than work more. CPWD engineers have been heard saying lower pay and perks look better when combined with an easy day in office.

Uddhav approached me but later backtracked: RajBJP
(Raj said that he got a call…)
MUMBAI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray dropped a bombshell on Thursday by claiming that his attempts to join hands with the Shiv Sena have come to nothing because of Uddhav's dithering.
Speaking to a private Marathi channel, the MNS chief claimed his last conversation with Uddav took place just hours after Sena's break-up with the BJP on September 25, when the Sena chief approached him to discuss a pre-poll alliance, but later showed no interest to take it forward.
Raj's revelations assume significance because political watchers are tracking closely whether the cousins will come closer. But the MNS chief made it amply clear that such an attempt has fallen through, at least for the time being.
Raj said that he got a call from Uddhav, and they discussed the three options before them: one was to join hands; the other was to avoid targeting each other; and the third was to strike a post-poll alliance.
"I asked him how to take this forward. He said two people from his side, including Sena MP Anil Desai, will deal with the matter with two of my deputies. We discussed this internally, and next morning, on September 26, MNS MLA Bala Nandgaonkar had a chat with Desai, but things just did not make any progress.
"We had almost reached a stage of dividing the seats on paper and holding back nomination forms in some constituencies. But Uddhav's reluctance to take this forward was obvious.
Desai stopped answering our calls. It was clear that Uddhav backtracked, so we went ahead and filed all our nominations," Raj explained.

Tilt against Congress and NCP, but Maharashtra poll battle still wide open

BJP
(According to most politicians,…)
MUMBAI: A four-cornered battle between the BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP and the X factor of MNS have turned the Maharashtra Assembly elections unpredictable.
The crucial factor, according to most politicians, is going to be the voting percentage. If polling figures match that of the LS polls, the ruling parties could be in trouble.
A tour of the key regions of the state shows a strong anti-incumbency against the 15-year old ruling combine, however, the divide in the saffron front has added a twist to the battle. The BJP is counting on the Modi Wave to work just the way it did during LS campaign.
The Congress is dependent on traditional supporters in the hinterland who might now feel sympathetic towards the party after the drubbing in Lok Sabha polls while the NCP wants to capitalise on its domination of the local institutions and caste equation.
On its part, the Sena wants to play the 'pride of Maharashtra' card. The state's main battles will be fought in the Mumbai metro region, Western Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha.
In Mumbai metro region's 36 seats, Congress and NCP won 20 while Shiv Sena and BJP won 9 and MNS 6 seats. The division between the saffron vote and Sena getting aggressive against many BJP candidates on its home turf, will help the Congress most in Mumbai region because the NCP is very weak here.
The equation in western Maharashtra is the opposite. Since both the Congress and NCP have solid bases here, their vote may get divided and the Sena will benefit in districts like Pune and Satara while the BJP will benefit in Sangli, Kolhapur and Ahmednagar.
In the 46 seats of the Marathwada region, the fight seems to be tilted in favour of the BJP and Sena. The sympathy wave for Gopinath Munde's daughters, the dissent against NCP and Modi's aggressive campaign in the region seem to have set the tone for the BJP. The drought-like situation in the region may work in favour of the BJP.
Vidarbha seems a difficult-to gauge region because of its varied nature and complex issues. How would the separate Vidarbha issue play out in these elections is anybody's guess.
In Konkan it's a battle between the Shiv Sena and NCP in the northern part while it's a Congress verses Sena fight in the southern part of the region. These fights are straight and predictable.

Modi walks into Pawar s territory  tries to bank on Dhangad nomadsBal Thackeray

BARAMATI: He breezed in without hesitation and roared. And it did not matter to him one bit that he was in the lion's den.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi came here, the impregnable fortress of the Pawars for nearly 50 years, and was greeted by an audience that looked both curious and excited.
And he took on the Pawars with vengeance. "This Chacha-Bhatij (uncle-nephew) have amassed so much wealth for a particular region that an entire state could have progressed with that money. No one even knows where all their wealth went. October 15 will mark an end to your struggles. Free yourself from the chacha bhatija," he told them.
Curiously, no big leader has ever spoken in Baramati after Indira Gandhi, not even Bal Thackeray or Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Perhaps, this was why for Modi's rally, hundreds of police personnel were brought in from Mumbai. The ubiquitous 'Modi' masks and boards that assured them of 'development' in Marathi were distributed among the people.
Modi said people need to oust the NCP to free their dreams, lands and fields from the Pawars. However, it is clear that winning over the people in the Pawar pocket-borough isn't going to be easy.
"The Pawars hold all power here. They are magnanimous to the people when they want to," said Rajat Naran, a teacher. But this is the place that residents claim is 'better than Gujarat', mainly because it has better electricity supply than other districts.
Modi told them he has suggested to Pepsico officials to add fruit juice in their drinks and if that works out, their miseries will be solved. But the sugarcane farmers respond with few cheers. One of them fondly remembers how once when their supply was getting spoiled, Sharad Pawar arranged for orders from wineries and their produce got sold off in three days. "No one can forget his Rs 9 a kilo of wheat and Rs 3 for rice. He was committed to serving the poor then," said Anil Jagtap, a sugarcane farmer.
"Ajit is not like him. He is brash. But he has done a lot of good too," he quickly adds. Ajit Pawar, the former deputy chief minister, has won from Baramati four times, and is contesting for a fifth time. For youngsters who swear by him, he is nothing less than a cult figure. "He is our dada. He has attitude and style, rides bikes, drives cars all by himself. At night, he does silent inspections of villages. If we have problems we will tell him, but not let outsiders in. Modi is good for the country, not here," said Aakash Sadhu, a factory worker.
A medical college, schools and a college for general courses ensure that a child doesn't go out of Baramati to study, and a textile park started by Ajit Pawar's wife has ensured employment for women, he adds. A number of institutes named after the Pawars show the deep influence of the family.
Ajit and Sharad Pawar will campaign in their hometowns only in the last two days but their family members, including Supriya Sule, Sharad Pawar's daughter who was present in Baramati the day Ajit Pawar filed his nomination, may need to, considering the good number of people who attended Modi's rally.
BJP knows it will be difficult to wrest the Pawar turf, but has adopted a strategy of making a decent fight of it. Their candidate opposite Ajit Pawar, is Balasaheb Gawde, from the shepherd community but is not very popular among the masses. "Even if we win by one vote here, it will be big. Even if they lose by 5,000 votes, it will be a loss for them. Also, only a few months ago, Supriya won by a margin of just 70,000 votes," said a BJP worker.
The road to Baramati links many villages and they can be divided into "which gets water" and "which does not". "There are 50-60 families who control all industries here. The poor in the region have only become poorer," said Madhav Bhandari, spokesperson, BJP (Maharashtra).
What the BJP is banking on is the the Dhangad community (shepherds). The community is listed as Nomadic Tribe but has been fighting for scheduled tribe status for years. The community, over 60,000 in Baramati alone, started moving away from Pawar after he went back on his promise in 2009 and the resentment deepened in July this year, when the Dhangads protested but were not heard by the Pawars.
Incidentally, it was late Gopinath Munde who thought of mobilising the Dhangads who also form a significant part of the population in his constituency, Beed.
In his address, Modi did not forget to speak about the problems of the Dhangads, and the NCP's 'betrayal'.

Amazon takes on Flipkart  might acquire JabongYou are here: Home > Collections > Portal
Amazon in talks to acquire Jabong; move a counter to Flipkart's Myntra buy?

( A regulatory filing by…)
BANGALORE: Amazon is in preliminary talks to buy Jabong, part of the US-based online retailer's plan to bolster its presence selling fashion products, four people aware of the discussions told ET.
Jabong is one of the fashion portals that Amazon is interested in acquiring, and Jabong has other suitors, the sources said, cautioning that a deal is not imminent. A regulatory filing by Rocket Internet, which incubated Jabong, put the value of the fashion portal at 388 million euros, or $500 million (Rs 3,000 crore).
A person with direct knowledge of negotiations said that Jabong is holding out for much more — at least $700 million. Amazon said it does "not comment on anything we may or may not do in the future". Jabong did not reply to emailed questions.
Deal to be complicated
"After Myntra got acquired by Flipkart, Jabong is the ideal candidate," said a person who is working closely with Amazon on the negotiation. A big chunk of the $2 billion that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has promised to invest in India is meant for acquisitions, this person said. Amazon is battling leader Flipkart for dominance in one of the world's fastest-growing markets for online retail, expected to reach Rs 50,000 crore by 2016 according to consultancy Crisil .
Last month, Bezos told ET that the value of goods sold by Amazon India in a year had topped $1 billion and that fashion was one of the "exciting frontiers" for the Seattlebased company. Jabong, which counts Germany's Rocket Internet and Swedish investment firm Kinnevik among its investors, is the secondlargest fashion portal in India after Myntra, which was acquired by Flipkart in May for an estimated value of $370 million.
According to industry estimates, the Flipkart-Myntra combine has a market share of over 50% in fashion retail and Jabong 25%. Fashionara and Limeroad are the other significant fashion portals. ET has not been able to establish if they are in talks with Amazon. For Amazon, getting it right in India is vital to its fortunes, especially because its presence in China is negligible where Alibaba dominates.
And the key to getting it right in India lies in fashion, the fastest-growing category for online retailers. According to retail consultancy Technopak, fashion accounts for 25% of the online retail industry's sales. To boot, operating margins in fashion are around 35% in an industry where gross margins are in negative territory.
Amazon India started offering fashion products on its marketplace in May, and an acquisition offers a swift route to scaling up. In the United States, Amazon chose a similar strategy to improve its fashion credentials by buying Zappos in 2009. Shares of UK-based clothing portal Asos have been on the rise after rumours of an acquisition by Amazon.
A deal with Jabong, while it may be desirable, will be complicated, said a source who is directly involved in the talks. The complication arises from the fact that in September, investors Rocket and Kinnevik began the process of merging five of their international fashion ecommerce companies, including Jabong, into a single global entity.

Here’s how you can learn from Flipkart’s Octoberfest
ET Bureau Oct 10, 2014, 03.58AM IST
(Flipkart’s October Revolution…)
By Vinay Dwivedi
NEW DELHI: Flipkart's Big Billion sale on October 6 left scores of shoppers disgruntled for various reasons. At the same time, there were lakhs of people who cashed in on some really sweet deals. Hits and misses aside, Flipkart's October Revolution offers several learnings for consumers, who want to be better prepared to take advantage of more such shopping bonanzas with Diwali coming up.
Discount Offered may not be Yours
Thousands of miffed customers discovered that their orders had not been executed. For every order that was placed, there were scores of unhappy consumers. There are too many people jostling for the same goods. According to Flipkart, it received a billion hits, while the number of people who actually managed to get their hands on items on offer was just 1.5 million. In other words, one in every 600 visitors to the site managed to shop. So, the advertised discount may not really be yours. You may be well prepared with all your payment details at hand, but you can never be sure you'll really get the stuff you want at the discounted price. Take the case of the Xiaomi phones launched a few weeks ago. They were gone in less than 3 seconds. When there are millions competing against you, the probability of you making a purchase is extremely low.
Save Time: Register & Use Wallets
Most people who got their hands on the discounted products were missionready at 8 am sharp — the moment the sale began — on Monday. If you were among them and still missed out, chances are you did not have a registered account with the e-tailer or you didn't have a registered payment account (Flipkart Wallet). While you were entering your credit/debit card details, those with registered accounts were hitting the buy button. If you want to grab future offers, having an e-wallet that you top up beforehand can speed up the checkout process. Also, browse the site beforehand, pick out the items that you are really keen on, and place them on a separate 'wishlist' that the site lets you create. That way, you can quickly and easily access your top picks and check whether they have been discounted deeply enough.
Deal on Offer may not be the Best
Order frustration was not the only reason prospective buyers were unhappy. Many customers bought goods on Flipkart only to learn later that rivals Snapdeal and Amazon were offering them at bigger discounts.
For instance, a MacBook Air that was being sold on Flipkart for Rs 54,000 was priced at Rs 50,000 on Snapdeal. It is customary for rival platforms to come up with their own deals when a peer announces a sale. So the next time there is such a sale and you have set your eyes on a specific product, compare its price on other platforms before you click on buy. If you have accounts on several platforms, comparing prices and purchasing the cheaper item becomes easier.
No Refunds or Exchange During Sale
Most sales, whether offline or online, have different rules than those that apply to normal purchases. TV ads of online retailers say that returning a product is very easy, but not if you have purchased it during a sale. If you have second thoughts about a purchase, you won't get a refund or even be allowed to exchange the product (unless it is faulty). So, control impulse buying during such sales. You cannot even cancel the order. You cannot get store credit. All this was listed in the terms and conditions on Flipkart's website. Of course there may not be enough time to go through these before you click accept.
Try to Use Cash on Delivery
If cancelled orders weren't bad enough, spare a thought for buyers who may still be waiting for their refunds. Online retailers are very prompt but refunds can still take up to 1-2 days to reflect in your account.
This can be quite a bother, especially if you have been denied the discount. To avoid this, choose the cash on delivery (COD) option. Even if you don't get the goods you order, at least you won't have to lock your money up.
Don't Lose Sight of Other Promos
Finally, often there are exclusive launches on the day of sale. In the rush to benefit from the discounts on offer, customers tend to miss out on these launches. For instance, Huawei launched it Honor 6 mobile phone exclusively on Flipkart on 6 October.
Perhaps in a bid to cash in on the discounted first-generation Moto X offering, you missed out on a phone that could have otherwise been your preferred choice. And now, you cannot exchange it.
Watch out for big launches during a sale. You might get more value from the new product than from a discounted offering.

ReTiSense  a wearable to predict sport injuriesYou are here: Home > Collections
Soon, Bangalore-based company to launch wearable to predict sport injuries
Malavika Murali, ET Bureau Oct 10, 2014, 04.43AM IST
BANGALORE: Injuries make or break careers in sports. So far, Indian athletes have had to rely on experience and a coach's knowledge to overcome them. But now, two friends Anshuman Singh, 36, and Shuvadeep Sarkar, 34, are solving this hurdle through their venture ReTiSense.
The Bangalore-based company, that set shop in June, is among the rising IoT (Internet of Things) startups that are close to launching its first wearable product. "I was an avid runner for 10 years, and then I started facing foot problems," said Anshuman Singh, a former Intel employee and co-founder of the four-monthold startup, which aims to clock Rs 20 lakh in revenue this fiscal. At present, it offers real-time analytics and custom solutions software to small and large enterprises and industries. Named Stridalyzer, the sensor-fitted-insole like product can be fitted into footwear and will predict and detect knee and foot injuries and inform the percentage of risk to the user.
The device, currently in the prototype phase, will be tied to a software application on iOS and Android platforms, and offer subsequent performance improvement measures to the runner.
Internet of Things, that has grabbed the attention of global technology players and governments, is one that allows gadgets to be connected and be co-dependent on each other.
"Most institutional investors look for product validation before making an investment," said Rutvik Doshi, principal at equity and venture capital firm Inventus Capital Partners.
"It is relatively very cheap for a software startup to build a product and distribute it to a few hundred users for validation. The cycle is much longer for hardware and hence you see fewer investments." ReTiSense raised an angel seed round of $45,000 (around Rs 27 lakh) from undisclosed strategic partners based in the US. Belgaumbased SenseGiz, Connovate Technology and GOQii are among the few known competitors in this space. But Stridalyzer will be the first of its kind in India, said Singh as it predicts and calculates injury risks aside from counting calories burnt and distance covered, largely the parameters that wearables of the above companies track.
A premium paid service will involve a health or fitness expert who will be connected to the app and device. The startup said it will launch this service in the latter half of 2015.
The complete launch of the product will take place next March, said Singh, who hopes to sell 20,000 units by the end of 2015 and touch $1.5 million in sales. The product will cost around $120 (around Rs 7,300). He hopes to accumulate pre-orders and entice customers through crowdfunding this December, and is currently in talks with crowdfunding sites like Wishberry.
A Markets and Markets report states that the entire wearable technology and electronics market is expected to touch $11.61 billion by the end of 2020 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.56% till 2020, with markets in Asia-Pacific growing at the highest CAGR in the coming six years' time.
"We've seen the emergence of a few fitness and specialised healthcare devices but I believe that this is just the beginning," said Doshi of Inventus Capital Partners.

Start-ups using multi-level assessments to minimise the risk of hiring wrong peopleCashkaro
(As Bhargava learnt first-hand,…)
MUMBAI: Hiring mistakes can prove costly given the fierce pace at which startups are scaling up. Swati Bhargava, co-founder of leading cashback site Cashkaro, learnt this the hard way when they hired a senior person for online marketing last year.
They faced various issues with the hire, says Swati, including overpromising and under-delivering on his part and management styles, which alienated other team members. "We had to let the person go in three months and undo and re-do a lot of work done by him. We realised in hindsight that it would have been better to wait and look for the right person than spend so much energy, time and resources on making it work," says Bhargava. In the process, Cashkaro estimates they lost out nearly Rs 8 lakh on salaries, training and the like.
As Bhargava learnt first-hand, the biggest challenge facing startups today isn't getting funded - it's hiring the right people. Attracting good talent isn't enough - they need to be the perfect fit as well. That's why a bunch of them, from Snapdeal and Vuclip to Cashkaro, Wingify and TastyKhana , are now deploying techniques like multi-level assessments, psychometric tests and roping in external partners to make sure they don't end up paying a heavy price for quick, wrong hires.
"The industry is growing at breakneck speed. The margin of error of getting a wrong hire is minimal," says Saurabh Nigam, VP - HR at Snapdeal. "We want to guarantee that our hiring is as scientific as possible."
Recently, Snapdeal rolled out a three-level assessment test to get the right talent, in skills, aptitude, culture and fitment. There's a standarised aptitude test with different benchmarks; after clearing which a candidate is tested on function-specific skills. In the technology domain, for instance, Snapdeal has tied up with HackerRank to test candidates on coding skills.
The final stage involving psychometric tests is to gauge cultural and values fitment, and for that Snapdeal is speaking to multiple partners besides the likes of Aon Hewitt and Development Dimensions International. All this will be in place before the company hits campuses for hiring later this year.
Cashkaro's Swati and her co-founder husband Rohan now extensively use numerical, written and psychometric tests to measure various parameters including analytical skills, communication skills, multitasking skills and the ability to function independently. "When it comes to recruitment, we can't afford to get it wrong," says Swati.
Unlike large companies which have big training setups to train new joinees, startups want people who can jumpstart, says Varun Aggarwal, CTO and COO of leading employability solutions company Aspiring Minds, which works with nearly 600 startups. "They really want to avoid bad hires. For some, even one bad hire might be 10% to 20% of their total work force," he says.
According to the Indian Startup Study Report 2014 by the Hay Group, Indian startups face a high employee attrition rate of 17%, which rises to 21% in growth startups, says its director Debabrat Mishra. "More than the direct cost, it's the cost to business that has bigger implications in case of a bad hire," says Anuj Roy, partner, digital practice at executive search firm Transearch.
Startups across the board agree that the success of their organisations hinges on the right talent. People who thrive in a startup are generally cut from a different cloth: they need to be goal-oriented, passionate, self-motivated, be able to handle uncertainty, think out of the box, be adaptable, open to chances and have the ability to exceed expectations.
Simulated tests of programming, personality assessment and those based on situation handling skills are very relevant for startups, says Aspiring Minds' Aggarwal. Their technology and products are used in various combinations by customers according to requirements and include AUTOMATA (simulated test of computer programming), AM-Start (workplace competency test measuring traits like effective communication, team work, learning attitude, prioritisation, etc) and AMPI (Big-five based personality inventory to measure goal-orientation, dependability, and so on).
In March this year, mobile video company Vuclip used psychometric tests at two campuses to filter through hundreds of resumes to get down to a set of about 30-40 candidates for in-person interviews.
"We assessed potential hires for what we call their 'get-it' ability as well as their other skills to help find the best functional and cultural fit. This is because we believe that a combination of natural intelligence (not just grades) coupled with a great attitude leads to amazing results," says Nickhil Jakatdar, CEO of Vuclip.
Candidates have mastered the art of cracking the interviews and hence, start-ups are using psychometric assessments to know their real self, adds Mohit Gundecha, co-founder and CEO of Jombay, a startup in the space of recruitments and profiling.
"Start-ups typically measure behavioural traits like stress tolerance, risk taking, adaptability, guilt consciousness and dependability of the potential hires," says Gundecha, whose clients include Vuclip and Pune-based food ordering startup TastyKhana. Jombay uses assessment and analytics to find the cultural fitment of the candidate to the job and the company.
Sparsh Gupta, partner and CTO of Wingify, says that they have used external agency tests to whittle down the number of applicants while hiring for customer happiness (support) engineers where the pool of available talent tends to be very big.
Overall, he says, the passion and the vision of the hires are hugely important. "Every product we design is like a baby. We nurture it, design it and spend months, even years, refining it. We need people who believe that we can become the next big thing and work towards making it happen."

Room for further upsides in housing: BrokersRoom for further upsides in housing space: Brokers
Rajesh Mascarenhas, ET Bureau Oct 10, 2014, 05.17AM IST
(Though many of these stocks…)
MUMBAI: Brokerages are pushing a new theme to their clients: Housing. As part of the idea, these firms have created a basket of stocks of companies, which could benefit from a possible revival in the housing sector. These include shares of companies in housing finance, paints, electrical equipment, plywood, laminates and granites.
Though many of these stocks have already run up as much as 50% in the past couple of months, brokers believe there is still room for further upsides. "We have been advising our clients those who want to participate in renewed boom in housing demand to buy the stocks of some of the best proxy play for the sectors rather than buying the real estate stocks," said Devang Mehta, senior vice-president & head of equity sales, Anand Rathi. "Our proxy theme for housing has played very well in the last few weeks." The realty sector is expected to rise during the second half of this financial year, according to Knight Frank-FICCI survey.
Analysts are not comfortable with the real estate sector because most companies are debt-laden. BSE's Realty index has declined over 17% in the last three months against the 4% rise in BSE Sensex. Some of the major players in realty sectors such as DLF, Unitech have fallen 25% and 27%, respectively, in the past three months. Stocks that are part of such baskets include Pidilite Industries, Canfin Homes, GIC Housing, Indiabulls Housing, Havells India, Crompton Greaves, Cera Sanitaryware, Kajaria Ceramics, HSI, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Century Plyboards among others. "The housing segment has to grow in India and the stocks which brokers are selling as proxy to housing boom will definitely benefit," said Dipen Shah, head of research, Kotak Securities. "However, their performance on stock market is subject to their valuations."
Some of these stocks such as HSIL, Century Plyboards, Cera Sanitaryware and Berger Paints have risen between 30% and 50% in the last three months. Most of the stocks such as HSIL, Pidilite, Havels and Asian Paints, Berger Paints are trading at a P/E of 40 times their trailing 12 months earnings. "There are many challenges in the housing sectors such as high inflation and interest rates," said Vinay Khattar, head of research, Edelweiss Financial Services. "However, if the housing demand rise, it would boost sectors like paints, cement, sanitary ware, pipes, electrical equipments, plywood and granites."

NRIs running into a wall while trying to ride the surge in Sensex

(In proposals where fund…)
MUMBAI: Narendra Modi's speech at Madison Square Garden may have electrified millions of non-resident Indians (NRIs), but many of them are running into a wall while trying to ride the surge in Sensex. Custodian banks - the depositories for offshore investors - are uncomfortable with fund structures that NRIs are setting up to bet on Indian stocks and equity indices.
In proposals where fund investors as well as asset managers are controlled by NRIs, depositors are refusing to register the entities as foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). The FPI regime, that has replaced the erstwhile regulation for foreign institutional investors (FII), has broadened the eligibility base for over overseas investors with the inclusion of family offices and private wealth managers. Instead of investing directly by running individual demat accounts with brokers in India (in line with the conventional portfolio investment scheme or PIS for NRIs), many NRI investors are keen to step in as FPIs.
Not only is the tax treatment for FPIs unambiguous, they argue that a fund structure allows professional fund management in a discretionary fund pool. But custodians fear that they may be pulled by later if an NRI crosses the 10% permissible holding limit by buying 5% equity of a listed company through the PIS route and another 10% through an FPI vehicle.
"One of the eligibility criteria under the FPI regulations states that the applicant should not be a 'non-resident Indian'. Keeping this in mind, some of the depositories have been taking a view that even broad-based funds which have predominantly NRI investors as well as an investment manager which is owned by a NRI is not be eligible to register as a FPI. This puts NRIs at a disadvantage to other foreign portfolio investors who are welcome under the FPI route," said Siddharth Shah, Corporate and Funds Partner at the law firm Khaitan & Co.
Richie Sancheti, who heads the funds practice at Nishith Desai Associates, said that based on practice and FAQs released by Sebi so far, it is clear that NRI-promoted entities can act as fund managers. "If such entity is appropriately regulated, it may also register as 'non-investing' FPIs. It is also clear that NRIs can participate in pooling structures or funds.
Such entities are also eligible for being considered as FPIs. What is, however, not spelt out in black and white is that the NRI promoter of a manager is also permitted to invest in the FPI managed by such a manager. The law does not restrict this, and further, commercial reality expects that fund managers put their money to risk by making capital commitment to the funds they manage.
This commitment is typically a fraction of the total corpus," said Sancheti. While the intent of the regulation was to avoid the overlap for NRIs between the PIS and the FPI route, NRIs and their advisors think that restricting broad-based funds which have NRI investors or a fund manager owned by NRI to access the FPI route is unfair and puts the NRIs at a disadvantage to other foreign investors.
Even in the erstwhile FII regulations, the limitation on NRIs investing through the broad-based sub-account route as well as FII registration for fund management entities owned by NRIs was done away with in 2008. According to Gautam Mehra, ED, PwC, it will be a good idea for the regulator to take a relook at the rules and give more flexibility.
For NRI family offices or trusts that cannot come use the PIS scheme, will be in a position to register as FPIs. However, fears of round-tripping of funds by resident Indians with the help of NRI relatives setting up investment outfits in Mauritius, acquiring indirect control of companies and overstepping investment limits are holding back local depositories.
"We have to be careful as the onus to ensure proper compliance with Sebi rules now rests upon Designated Depository Participants," said an official with a custodian. Since May 16 when Modi was sworn in as prime minister, foreign funds have invested.Rs 38,000 crore, pulling up the bellwether Sensex 7.7%.

Axis Bank CEO Shikha Sharma brings in smooth transition  creating trustReinventing Axis Bank: CEO Shikha Sharma brings in smooth transition, creating trust
Dibeyendu Ganguly, ET Bureau Oct 10, 2014, 05.10AM IST
Movie metaphors come naturally to Shikha Sharma. When we asked her how it was to be mentored by KV Kamath at ICICI Bank, for an earlier article in Corporate Dossier, she's likened him to Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady.
This time, when we ask her about the changes at Axis Bank, she says, "Look at how the fate of a movie is decided in the first weekend by what people say on social media. People are empowered. The Web has changed the world and the bank has to change with it." Over time, Sharma has proved herself to be a master at managing transitions.
When she moved from ICICI Prudential Life Insurance to take charge as managing director and CEO of Axis Bank five years ago, the bank was in the throes of an identity crisis — a private bank with characteristics of a public sector organisation. Sharma changed all that and turned Axis Bank into a player, in the same league as ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.
Axis is now a retail bank, as opposed to its earlier corporate focus, and Sharma is leading a second transition as it goes digital. But Sharma doesn't want to be the heroine of the Axis Bank movie. When we ask her about change leadership as opposed to change management, she says "I don't understand the difference."
Change management is about executing changes at a micro level, with minimal disruption and cost, while change leadership is about inspiring a transformation in culture. Sharma knows the difference, the doe-eyed Audrey Hepburn impersonation notwithstanding. But rather than split semantic hairs, we ask: what's the key to managing a smooth transition? "It starts with figuring out what needs to be changed and what doesn't," says Sharma.
"Sometimes you need to change something that still seems to be working perfectly well, based on signals you receive from the environment. When we shifted from corporate to a retail orientation, there was no immediate reason. Or when we launched our mobile interface even before internet. As Mr Kamath once said to me, success is the biggest barrier to change. Successful people are the often the most resistant to change."
Anticipating changes in the environment before they start damaging the organisational fabric is the essence of leadership. When Sharma joined Axis in 2008, corporate banking in India was beginning to feel the pinch of the global slowdown.
(In photo: Shikha Sharma)
The crisis became worse, but the bank had by then slowed down on corporate lending and shifted focus to retail lending. Sharma herself had no previous experience in wholesale change management -- her big project had been ICICI Prudential, a start up, where everyone was new. At Axis, on the other hand, there was an old guard which needed to be persuaded.
"Communication is a very important part of change management," says Sharma. "You need to communicate to everyone what you're trying to do, how you're going to do it. You need to get inputs from everyone. Then you have to maintain a pace of change that is digestible and doesn't cause disruption. For example, we didn't halt corporate banking altogether. We just slowed it down."
Communication and persuasion are slow processes and take up much of a new CEO's time and energy, but the only alternative is to start a reign of terror and remove everyone who resists.
Sanjeev Gupta joined Axis (then UTI Bank) from State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur 20 years ago and today he's designated CFO and executive director (corporate centre). Though he's 53 (the same age as Sharma) he plays the role of senior statesman, like a stern Christopher Plummer from The Sound of Music, inspiring awe and reverence amongst the young set at the bank.
Talking us through the various transitions the bank has gone through under previous CEOs, he says, "Shikha could have wrought drastic change by sidelining all of us and bringing her own people, as many outside CEOs are known to do. There was anxiety, but she ensured a smooth transition by including everyone in strategy deliberations, creating trust. Which is why the four executive directors who were there when she joined stayed till retirement. We oldtimers are happy to be part of positive change. That is why we had originally left the public sector to join this bank."
Asked about the new transition to digital banking and the loosening of controls this might entail, Gupta just shrugs and says, "I've seen many frauds in my time, when there were tight controls. I'm not unduly worried about the risks in digital banking. Besides, who can object to something which is so obviously good for customers?"
  Axis has always been a fairly techsavvy bank. Former managing director PJ Nayak was ahead of his time in taking a big bet on ATMs and the bank has 13,000 of them, more than any other private sector bank and second only to SBI. Axis is now planning to shut down some of the less utilised ATMs located in small towns.

Dating app Luxy launched to unite only ‘rich & beautiful’ hearts
Evelyn Fok, ET Bureau Oct 10, 2014, 04.10AM IST
(While Luxy's arrival…)
BANGALORE: "Tinder minus the poor people" is a tagline that may cause dry heaves but it seems there's great demand for this sort of thing. Twenty years after the first online dating site appeared, an app aimed specifically at the "rich and beautiful" was launched last week.
Luxy, the newest dating app to emerge from Silicon Valley, will apparently allow the unspeakably posh to encounter their equally well-endowed counterparts online, outside their elite country clubs and exclusive dinner parties. "It works just like Tinder," said the Luxy press release that set off an uproar on social media, referring to the popular dating app that runs on a hot-or-not model.
"With one big exception: Our app allows users to weed out the poor and unattractive." Upon signing up, users are asked to declare their hobbies— horseback riding, golf, boating— and identify their favourite luxury brands. The CEO, who remains anonymous, has said that the app has 3,000 users, and that its male users average an annual income of $200,000.
While Luxy's arrival sparked derision among those who find its approach repulsive, it's worked well in class-conscious India, where the online dating and matrimonial scene has long been plagued with taboos to do with verification, fraud, and "option overload". This has spurred players to carve out more exclusive niches in the online dating market to accommodate the needs of affluent Indians struggling to find others of similarly well-off, cosmopolitan backgrounds.
There is DateIITians, which enjoyed widespread recognition when it launched two years ago. After a hiatus, the exclusive service for IIT graduates is planning to return in an app form by the end of the year.
Three-year-old Floh, as well as industry newcomers Woo and Aisle, create curated communities where individuals "desirable" attributes. Individuals are evaluated based on myriad details they disclose around their educational background, employment, and physical appearance, among others. "As a single male who recently moved to Mumbai, Floh has been for me the perfect prescription," said 26-year-old entrepreneur Raghav Somani.
"Because of the screening process, you're sure to find liberal, intelligent and extremely like-minded people to have shared experiences with. Your chances of finding someone special are really high." Is there any complicated science at play here? Aisle founder Able Joseph said it judges applicants on the sole criterion of "taste." But strong self-selection processes are at play.
These services come associated with a considerable cost - Aisle, which considers itself a "closed community of single Indians sincerely looking for our better halves" rather than a dating app, charges Rs 1,999 for every three invitations sent to potential romantic interests."It's a win-win solution," Joseph said. "We can also keep a check on spam invites that you get on other online platforms."
On the other hand, Floh charges subscribers on a membership plan basis. Users gain access to the community for three months for Rs 7,500, while a full year costs Rs 15,000. It has also organised more than 200 paid events for members to get to know each other in person, ranging from sailing trips to heritage walks.
Over the past three years, Floh has seen a number of marriages between its members, and it started creating events for members in New York City last month. As a result, these startups become bootstrapping successes. For instance, Floh turned cash positive after its first month, and does not prioritize raising further capital. "We have had the freedom to experiment fairly widely because we have complete control," said cofounder Siddharth Mangharam.

Robert Vadra deals 10 years of loot: KhemkaAshok Khemka calls Robert Vadra deals 10 years of loot

Ashok Khemka
CHANDIGARH: Ashok Khemka , who acted as the whistleblower in the Robert Vadra land deal case in Haryana, has said that a clean chit from the Election Commission (EC) stating that there is no poll code violation does not mean no financial wrongdoing has been committed in the transaction involving Congress president Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law.
Talking to ET, the IAS officer said the EC has only maintained that there was no violation of the election code of conduct as the deal was done before September 12 when the code came into force after assembly polls for Haryana were announced.
"Ten years of loot can't be absolved just like that. EC has only said that there was no poll code violation. This is not a clean chit (for Vadra)," Khemka said. The land deal was cleared on July 16. Khemka underlined that corruption was an "intricate issue" and cannot be seen only as somebody giving money "off hand" for a deal and somebody else accepting it. The bureaucrat who has faced more than 44 transfers in his 23 year career, said the EC gave its judgement only on the basis of the facts presented to it by the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government.
Earlier in the day, BJP had wondered if all the facts relating to the case were put by the Congress government in Haryana before the poll panel.
Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has raised questions on the role of the state government in the whole affair. Congress leader Salman Khurshid dismissed this allegation and said this is an attempt to "stonewall" the due process. "EC is nobody to say that there was no wrongdoing in the case," Khemka told ET.
He also accused the media of distorting facts relating to the case and focusing only on whether it was a poll code violation. "This is the height of ridiculousness by the media," the officer said. Meanwhile, INLD has also said the process followed in the land deal is "wrong and illegal".
"This is not an election code violation issue. I don't know how the prime minister went wrong on this. The process followed in the land deal is wrong and illegal" RS Chaudhary, senior leader of INLD told ET.

HC disqualifies five legislators who supported HoodaHigh Court disqualifies five legislators who supported Bhupinder Singh Hooda

Bhupinder Singh Hooda
(Justice K Kannan has termed…)
CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana High Court has disqualified five Haryana legislators, including two ministers, who had deserted Haryana Janhit Congress in 2009 to support Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led minority Congress government in the state.
Justice K Kannan has termed the assembly speaker's decision to recognise the splinter group's merger into the Congress as "unconstitutional".
The ruling, coming just five days before the state goes to polls, is being seen as a blow to Congress . It came on a petition filed by Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) leader Kuldeep Bishnoi .
The five legislators are Satpal Sangwan, Rao Narender Singh, Vinod Bhayana, Zile Ram Sharma and Dharam Singh. While Sangwan is minister for cooperation and housing, Singh is the minister for health and medical education and Bhayana is the chief parliamentary secretary.
Justice Kannan held that the speaker's decision accepting the merger was against the constitutional mandate; and the decisions "were not vitiated merely by error in reasoning". The decisions were, rather, "egregious".
The MLAs had won the elections as HJC candidates, but soon after they claimed that a decision had been taken to merge HJC with the Congress. The speaker accepted the plea for merger.
"The order accepting the merger on November 9, 2009, was hasty, sans basis and without undertaking the minimum of collection of data regarding the decision of the original political party," the order said.
There was "absolutely no proof of merger of the original political party," Justice Kannan said. "If I say that the decision of the speaker in the first instance on November 9, 2009, was against the constitutional mandate, I say so because the letter written by the legislators on November 9, 2009, and the decision taken on the same day were literally on no evidence produced."
"The speaker, who received the letter from the Congress that HJC had merged with them, did not think it necessary, surprisingly, to look for a similar letter even from the leader of that political party which had merged...The speaker had no material at all to take such a decision."

FIIs put in 47% of India equity in defensives but room for valuation expansion seen limited
Ashutosh Shyam, ET Bureau Oct 10, 2014, 05.26AM IST
(However, analysts say these…)
Defensive stocks, or stocks of companies whose performance is not tied to the larger economic cycle, caught the attention of foreign institutional investors in the quarter to September due to the massive outperformance compared with cyclical stocks as well as earnings upgrades.
However, analysts say these stocks, much like their cyclical counterparts, do not have much room left for expansion in terms of valuation. Therefore, these stocks need to deliver solid growth figures to maintain the momentum. During the 3-month period, defensive stocks gained 28.70% on average while cyclical stocks delivered just 3.18% returns.
In August alone, FIIs deployed nearly 47% of their investment in Indian equities in defensive stocks. Saifullah Rais of Kotak institutional equities wrote in a note that cyclical stocks underperformed defensive stocks during the quarter, with only automobiles among the cyclical sectors outperforming the BSE-30 index during the period.
"Information technology and pharmaceuticals were the other sectors to post strong gains over the past three months. Market performance preceded any substantial change in earnings expectations during the period," the note said, adding that cyclical stocks saw consensus earnings revised downwards, with only consumer discretionary sectors and healthcare along with a few others, seeing upward earnings revisions.
Solid results for the 3-month period will be required in these rerated sectors to maintain the momentum, Rais said in the note. Minus automobiles, cyclical stocks delivered just 1.13% returns during the quarter. Among the defensive stocks, Cipla gained the maximum at 63%, followed by Lupin with 49% gain. In the IT sector, stocks such Infosys, Tech Mahindra and TCS gained 27-29% which Nifty gained just 10% during the period. The outperformance of defensive stocks can be attributed to two main factors.
First, the uncertainty over when US Federal Reserve will start scaling back its record low benchmark interest rates prompted investors to turn to less risky equity assets. This resulted in FIIs increasing their equity allocation towards defensive stocks. According to NSDL data, FII invested $909 million in Indian equities in August.
Of this, FIIs invested $435 million in defensive stocks from sectors such as pharmaceuticals, information technology and consumer staples. In the second fortnight of August, FIIs deployed 27.5% of their total investment in the IT sector. Second, the valuation premium offered to defensive stocks over cyclical stocks reduced considerably after cyclical stocks gained substantially in the preceding quarter.
This looked untenable in absence of supporting earnings upgrades. The valuation premium between the defensive and cyclical stocks came down 45% in June compared to historical average of nearly 80%. As alarm bells started ringing in the global equities market, investors started reducing exposure to the cyclical stocks.
As a result, FIIs sold nearly $188 million of capital goods sector stocks in August after receiving nearly $454 million of inflows in the previous six months. "The biggest fear of increasing FII allocation in the defensive stocks such as IT, pharma and consumer staples would be that benchmark indices would not fall significantly as weight of these defensive sectors is quite high, though on the broader market we will see more downside in case global risk-off trades continue," said a fund manager.

I want Nissan to be an Indian company: PresidentWe need people to work 100% for India. I want Nissan Motors to be an Indian firm, says President Gillaume Sicard
Ketan Thakkar, ET Bureau Oct 10, 2014, 02.17AM IST

(Without the network, how…)
Nissan Motor India is undertaking a major organisational restructuring. Leading the new organisational set up is Gillaume Sicard , president, who will oversee manufacturing, sales and R&D for the Japanese carmaker's Indian subsidiary. The company has also appointed an Indian MD Arun Malhotra from M&M to resurrect its key weakness of sales and marketing and dealer development after breaking ties with Hover Automotive.
In an interview to ET's Ketan Thakkar, Sicard said Nissan Motor India has all the key elements of products, manufacturing and R&D that are needed to succeed in India. Going ahead, he said, the company is going to be more pro-active in engaging with the Indian customers to grow through expanding dealer network and strengthened sales & marketing. Edited excerpts:
The commitment from Renault Nissan is pretty apparent, but the brands have not attained the acceptability that one would have liked. What's your view?
I am re-assured about our product lineup and quality of cars we produce. We have products that are extremely suitable for Indian market. Of course, we would love to have more products, but the base is here in terms of manufacturing and R&D.
However, there are a few things that we need to progress on. First is our network. With the products that we have, we cover merely a third of the country. Without the network, how can we be a major player? Especially if we launch a new brand like Datsun, which is relevant to tier-2 and tier-3 cities. We will expand the network to 300 locations within 3 years. And along with the network expansion, we also have to ensure the quality customer engagement. Our association with the customer does not end at the point of sale; we need to take it forward through his entire ownership lifecycle.
Secondly, I was not happy about our marketing and communication. When I looked at what we had done, it seemed like we were looking at the Indian market from bit too far. We need to be involved with the Indian customers and appeal to their hearts. We need not be just a Japanese brand that has good technology and offers quality products (corporate brand image), but we also need to bring in some emotions and connect with the customers. We need to open up, we can have flexibility, the top management in Yokohama (HQ) are clever, they realise that we need to adapt the corporate brand to what's happening in India.
So we have good products, good pricing, the basics are here, the key lies in improving the network and the way we connect to the consumers.
What are some of things you need to do to evolve the operations?
We definitely need to have organisation that is focused on Indian market more than to Japan.
Was that the case before?
No. It was this balance, we strived for. But we need people to work 100% for India. I want this to be an Indian company. We have R&D antenna of 4,500 people, Datsun Go is already developed here. We already have the autonomy, but we need to accelerate here, even in terms of management.
I am French, but I need talented Indian people, of course we need expats too, but less and less with time and more local talent. We are changing the organisation in that direction. Yes, there is a president, but we are having a local MD now, who has experience in the Indian automotive industry and comes from the heart of the market.
How that will change things according to you?
If we have people who have worked for 20-30 years in the Indian market, they will have better capability to connect with the network, to the customers and the administration.
Beauty of the organisation is to have talent that not only masters the environment, but also different kind of environment to enrich the Indian operation. What we need to do is have a mixture of Indian people, supported by some good crop from around the world who have knowledge, so that the growth picks up and it is as secured as possible in India.
Do you think the sales and marketing was the weakest link?
I would say so. Yes.
So what is the next step?
We have revised the whole organisation from sales and marketing perspective.
The key positions have been identified; we are looking at some additional people. We will enroll more people in sales and marketing functions shortly. We are also going to develop a strong marketing and communication team. In terms of advertising, we are working intensively with our advertisement agencies to make sure the new messaging connects with the consumers.
We are very young at the job, because the functions of sales and marketing were managed by someone else (Hoover). We need to build pure sales and marketing organisation with strong forces (resources).
Where do you see yourself three years from now?
I would like to see familiarity of both the brands within top 5. We are at number 12 right now. We need to have the top of the mind-awareness. Second, I want that the factory is used to full capacity and why not ask for additional capacity 2-3 years from now, by growing both domestic and export operation.
On the products front?
Two key things we are working on are SUVs and products for Datsun. We have the know-how of SUVs, it is in our genes. We can go quick in there and serve the rising demand.
On Datsun, there is more room at the bottom of the pyramid, once we break the clutter, we know there is room for other players. We are going to build the Datsun brand further, it will be a three range products, with products that are made for Indian buyers (entry-level car and an affordable MPV).

Deepinder Goyal is a first generation entrepreneur, but got support from his family when he set up Zomato.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
There was a time when people would rack their brains to search for a place to eat out. The online restaurant guide Zomato started in 2008 and changed that. With a few clicks, it suggested places you could eat or order food from.
Since then, the Gurgaon-based company has been on an expansion overdrive. Zomato's net is now spread in 16 countries. It entered four new markets by acquiring local equivalents of itself — MenuMania (New Zealand), Lunchtime (Czech Republic), Obedovat (Slovakia) and Gastronauci (Poland).
Last month, Zomato expanded its presence in Indonesia. The firm also won the 2014 Economic Times 'Startup of the Year' award. ETPanache speaks to Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO, Zomato, about all things food and business.
What does food mean to you? What do you consider to be soul food?
Food for me has always been about exploring and discovering cuisines. My need to discover food translated into organising menus and this gave birth to Zomato. About soul food, nothing hits the spot like butter chicken.
What are the new things you learnt about different food cultures through your job?
In Philippines, I learnt that it's rude to stay quiet while eating. In Qatar and the UAE, you never touch food with the left hand. In the UK, never leave a spoon in a teacup.
Getting into a new market is challenging. In which city did you enjoy setting up business and which were the places which were difficult to penetrate?
We had a memorable country launch in Lisbon, Portugal. The vibrant dining and internet scene makes it a great market for our product. Restaurant owners and the people in Lisbon were extremely receptive to our platform.
On the contrary, the UK entry was tough because of competition and the market size. The market is extremely fragmented in terms of discovery and transactional websites. When we launched in January 2013, we ran an outdoor advertising campaign in the London underground in advance to raise awareness about Zomato. In other countries, we haven't needed to advertise.
What features did you introduce to woo customers in the UK?
We offered restaurants based on categories such as 'great places for breakfast', 'pet friendly' restaurants, etc, based on the popularity of these restaurant categories in London. We recently launched table bookings by partnering with Opentable, Bookatable and ResDiary.
How do you know you are hiring the right people, especially in smaller cities and cities abroad?
We try to go beyond traditional hiring techniques. A person's personality and attitude are definitely what stand out during our hiring conversations. One without the other doesn't cut it for us.
We started 'Trial Week' for engineers and 'Leadership Program'that focuses on picking up former entrepreneurs. Of course, finding the right person can take months. Once we have identified the right person in the leadership position,though, it takes us about three or four days to make the offer.
From which city in India do you clock maximum traffic and for what cuisines?
Delhi sees the most traffic in India. It's by far the most exciting city for food in the country. There's been a high demand for global cuisines in the Capital with increasing demand for Italian food. We are also noticing steady user increase in smaller cities. With an increase in the number of young professionals with high disposable incomes, eating out has become extremely popular.
You are a foodie. What is the weirdest dish you have had till now and where?
Black pudding in London. I tried it during our London launch. A few of my colleagues and I had stepped out for breakfast and ordered a full English breakfast. When I had the first bite of this strange black mass on my plate, I made a weird face. My colleague informed me the dish contained pig's blood mixed with some oatmeal. I continued eating it.
Your favourite food dishes?
I eat out a fair bit (more than I like, actually). My favourite dishes are Galouti kebabs and butter chicken.
How do you maintain a work-life balance?
I am online from Monday to Saturday. On Sundays, however, I try to switch off so I can spend time with my wife Kanchan and daughter.
What was your parents' reaction when you quit Bain & Company to focus on Zomato? We hear you told them after you put in your papers. And are you a first generation entrepreneur in your family?
Yes, I'm a first generation entrepreneur. My parents don't really think about things once they have happened. When I told them I had quit my job, their reaction was "Ok, whatever, you'll figure it out". They asked me to tell them if things got difficult financially. My wife, Kanchan, has supported me always and is a big believer of Zomato. It is important having family's support in your entrepreneurial pursuits.
Is there a well-known person you have an unexpected connection with?
I share a great working relationship with investor Sanjeev Bikhchandani of Info Edge. He is more an entrepreneur, less investor. When Sanjeev and I met for the first time, we hit it off. It's been a great run since then.
On Zomato.xxx
Around 2010-11, people were starting to talk a lot about food porn. We realised we were sitting on an untapped opportunity. xxx domains are hard to come by and we thought it would be a good idea to get a xxx domain for the purpose of displaying delicious food. We have seen a great response from users.

Bihar: six women allegedly raped at gunpoint in villageComments
Three men allegedly took three minor girls and three women to an isolated place at gunpoint in a Bihar village, tied them with ropes and forced alcohol down their throats before taking turns to rape them, the police said.
The incident took place on Wednesday at Kurmuri village in Bhojpur district of south central Bihar, about 90 km west of Patna. The women are ragpickers and belong to mahadalit community. Two of them are married.
The police have arrested two of the accused - Nilnidhi Singh, a scrap dealer and former area commander of Ranveer Sena, a now defunct private militia of landlords that was active in central Bihar in the 1980s and '90s, and his brother Jayaprakash Singh.
Till this report was filed, the third accused, Jaggu Pandit, was on the run.
In their complaint, the women told the police that they had gone to sell junk at Nilnidhi's shop at Kurmuri on Wednesday evening. They were asked to wait on the pretext that the scrap dealer had no change to pay them.
It was learnt the women agreed to stay overnight as it was already dark. Soon, however, the accused, brandishing pistols, took the women to an isolated place, tied them with ropes and forced alcohol down their throats before taking turns to rape them.
The women narrated the ordeal to family members on Thursday. Thereafter, the matter was reported to the police.
On Friday morning, hundreds of people, including CPI-ML (Liberation) activists, blocked the Fatehpur-Sikarhatta road, to press for the arrest of all the accused and suspension of station house officer of Sikarhatta police station.
The CPI-ML activists also took out procession in Ara town in protest against the incident.
The incident comes at a time when a mahadalit chief minister, Jitan Ram Manjhi, is heading the state. Mahadalit is a special category created by the Bihar government to identify the poorest among dalits so that they could be recipient of special benefits.
The chief minister on Friday directed the district magistrate (DM) and superintendent of police (SP) of Bhojpur to jointly inquire into the matter and submit the report within a week.
"The charge sheet against the accused should be filed at the earliest for a speedy trial of the case. The officials found lacking in discharge of their duties should also be punished as per rules," Manjhi said before leaving for New Delhi via Gaya.
The CM also directed for immediate payment of compensation to all the five victims under the provisions of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.
He ordered the Bhojpur district magistrate to provide alternative employment to all the five victims in government run schemes.
Bhojpur superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar said a case has been registered and deputy superintendent of police Krishna Kumar Singh has been asked to investigate.
The six women were brought to Ara Sadar hospital for medical examination by a team of doctors on Friday.
"After getting the medical examination report, we will submit the charge sheet in court against all the accused involved in this incident within a week and speedy trial of the case will be conducted to punish the guilty," Bhojpur district magistrate Pankaj Kumar Pal said.
Taking a serious note of the incident, state women commission has asked the Bhojpur SP to submit a report within five days. The commission will also inquire into the incident.

INLD chief Chautala to go back to jail todayINLD chief Chautala to go back to jail today
Soibam Rocky Singh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 10, 2014

The Delhi high court on Friday cut short INLD leader Om Prakash Chautala’s campaign for the Haryana election and ordered him back to the high-security Tihar jail, where he is serving a 10-year term in a teacher recruitment scandal.
The court asked the former Haryana chief minister to surrender by Saturday and was critical of him for violating bail conditions — granted on plea of ill-health — by campaigning extensively for the October 15 election.
“You (Chautala) cannot take the court for a ride and cannot be permitted to question the majesty, dignity and decorum of this court,” justice Siddharth Mridul said. The court had on a number of occasions extended the bail first granted in May 2013.
After Cong, BJP misusing CBI: Abhay Chautala
With three days to go for the voting, it remains to be seen if the order will have a bearing on the fortunes of the Indian National Lok Dal, eyeing a comeback in the northern state.
The party has been counting on Chautala, its senior-most leader, to take on an aggressive BJP and capitalise on the anti-incumbency faced by the ruling Congress.
But, Chautala in jail may also translate into sympathy votes for the INLD that has considerable influence over Jat voters, expected to influence the outcome in at least 25 of the 90 assembly seats.
 In fact, the INLD accused the BJP of misusing the CBI to keep Chautala away from people.
His battery of lawyers, led by Ram Jethmalani, tried to convince the court to allow the 79-year-old to stay out of jail till Monday. But the court refused relief. “Let him surrender tomorrow. Let’s not bargain over this,” it said.
In an earlier hearing, the court had set October 17 as the date for surrender. In a plea filed Thursday, the CBI said Chautala be asked to return to jail immediately as he was busy holding poll rallies in violation of bail conditions.
Chautala, his son Ajay and eight others were sentenced to 10-year jail term on January 2013 for illegally recruiting 3,206 junior teachers. The former CM has challenged the judgment in the high court and a verdict is awaited.
Earlier in the day, Chautala appeared before a special CBI judge in a 2006 disproportionate assets case, which will now come up for hearing on October 30.

Lopez, Federer, Djokovic in last four
Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer set up a rematch of their Wimbledon final with convincing straight-set wins to reach the semifinals of the Shanghai Masters on Friday.
The top-ranked Djokovic defeated David Ferrer 6-4, 6-2 to extend his winning streak in China to 28 matches, while Federer played a nearly flawless second set to beat Julien Benneteau of France 7-6 (4), 6-0.
It will be the 36th meeting in their rivalry, which has been remarkably close, with Federer taking 18 of their matches and Djokovic 17. The players have split their four matches this year, though Djokovic earned the far biggesr prize with his second Wimbledon trophy in July.
“There is no clear favorite,” Djokovic said. “Every time we play against each other, it’s a thriller.”
The Serb would seem to have a slight advantage given his recent dominance in China, where he hasn’t lost since a semifinal defeat to Federer in Shanghai in 2010. Since then, he’s captured the China Open three times, and the Shanghai Masters twice.
But Djokovic doesn’t believe the court or his sizeable contingent of Serbian-flag-waving Chinese fans will give him an edge.
“Well, it’s not like he didn’t have a lot of success anywhere he went, including China,” he said. “He knows how to play here. He has also big support.”
Djokovic played much better on Friday than he did in the previous round, when he struggled to put away big-hitting Mikhail Kukushkin.
Federer, too, played his most solid match of the week against Benneteau. He had 34 winners to only 13 unforced errors, and won nearly all of the points on his first serve (34 of 37).
The Swiss star, who will overtake Rafael Nadal to return to No. 2 in the rankings next week, said he has faced Djokovic so many times now, there were no secrets to each other’s games.
“We’ll see how much he can actually do, how much he can neutralize me, and how much I can do with him,” he said. “But he’s playing a great season again. I’ll give it the best shot I have. I have a good game at the moment.”

The other semifinal will feature two veterans playing some of their best tennis Gilles Simon and Feliciano Lopez.
Lopez, who knocked out an ailing Rafael Nadal in the second round, defeated Mikhail Youzhny 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 in the quarterfinals.
At 33, the Spaniard is having a resurgent year, winning his fourth career title at Eastbourne and rising to No. 16 in the rankings, one off his career high. He’s also a three-time semifinalist in Shanghai, though he’s never advanced to the final.
Simon upset sixth-seeded Tomas Berdych 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-0. It was his second top-10 win of the week after beating fourth-seeded Stan Wawrinka in the second round.
Asked the last time he managed to do that, he said, “I don’t know. You tell me. Maybe never.”
Lopez has won two of their three previous meetings, though both matches were on grass.

Hudhud now a very severe cyclone  east coast on alert38 trains cancelled as cyclone Hudhud picks up momentum

Cyclone Hudhud was upgraded to a “very severe cyclonic storm” on Friday as it hurtled towards India’s east coast, where it is expected to make landfall near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh by Sunday noon.

The governments in Andhra and Odisha, which also lies in the storm’s path, will start massive evacuations on Saturday and has put the local administration on high alert. In Visakhapatnam alone, about 35,000 people need to be evacuated from 57 coastal villages and moved to 40 relief camps.
“The storm will gain in intensity and hit the coast at a speed of 140-150 kmph with wind speeds of up to 165kmph,” India Meteorological Department director general Dr LS Rathore said.
Rising waters of the cyclone would inundate low lying areas of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts of Andhra, he added.
The gathering storm comes almost exactly one year after Phailin, also a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’, hit the Odisha coast, bringing gales of 200-220kmph that killed nearly 30 people and displaced more than 400,000.
“We are expecting Hudhud’s intensity to decrease 12 hours after hitting the coast,” Rathore said, forecasting rain in parts of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. There will be no impact on the climate in Delhi, he added.
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has dispatched 39 teams — 1,573 personnel and 193 boats — to vulnerable places in the two states. “The Centre is closely monitoring Hudhud’s progression,” said home minister Rajnath Singh, after speaking to the chief ministers of Odisha, Andhra and Telangana.

Schools and colleges in Visakhapatnam will be closed on Saturday. Fishing operations have been suspended in six districts of Andhra and four in Odisha.
“If people don’t leave even after the warnings, police will be used to evacuate them,” said Visakhapatnam district magistrate N Yuvaraj.
The armed forces are also on alert with four warships of the Eastern Naval Command and six naval aircraft on standby for rescue operations and airdropping of relief material. The Coast Guard has deployed 17 ships and nine aircraft.
The cyclone is also set to hit railway services with 38 trains cancelled and 31 diverted. Flight operations at Visakhapatnam airport would also be affected.
In Odisha, officials said heavy rainfall was expected in eight districts for the next two days. Rescue personnel have started mock drills in at least 323 multi-purpose cyclone shelters. “If necessary, people in the eight districts will be evacuated to cyclone shelters,” Odisha special relief commissioner PK Mohapatra said.
The scare is evident in Odisha’s Ganjam district, badly hit by Phailin. At Gopalpur, where Phailin made landfall, the beaches looked deserted on Friday. “At least 80% tourists have cancelled their bookings,” said a hotel owner.

Wall St Week Ahead: Investors gird for scarier days in marketsVolatility has returned to US stocks in sudden fashion, and for the first time all year it doesn't appear that weakness in equities is going to go away quietly in the span of a few days.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: Volatility has suddenly returned to US stocks , and for the first time all year it doesn't appear that the weakness in equities will go away quietly in the span of a few days.
While the S&P 500 is still up 3.1 per cent for the year, the index is off about 5 per cent from its record high reached in mid-September, and closed out this week at the lowest level since May 23.
"We're still in a bull market, but in the near term things are a little bit dicey, and I don't think the decline is over with yet," said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, Florida.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly declines since May 2012, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended Friday in negative territory for the year.
The S&P also posted back-to-back intraday moves of more than 40 points this week for the first time in three years. Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, ended at 21.24 on Friday, its highest level since early February.
Investors said they were concerned about the eventual end of Federal Reserve stimulus, as well as weak growth overseas and its potential effect on US earnings. The slide in oil prices has also served as a harbinger for poor demand, and investors in general got caught betting heavily on further market gains at a time when this stew boiled over.
The volatility recalls the last major period of big market gyrations in the second half of 2011, when the first-ever credit downgrade of the United States and the threat of a debt default kept investors on their toes for several months. It is unclear whether the current turmoil will last as long.
"What is interesting about what is going on is that you have several themes all feeding into the same action, and that action is to mitigate risk," said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist of Clearpool Group in New York.

LoC firing: Injured children still unaware of their tragedyA child at a hospital in Jammu on Friday. Photo: Nissar Ahmad
TOPICS
Jammu
On bed number 10 at the Government Medical College Hospital, Jammu, a nine-year-old boy waits in silence for a glimpse of his mother. A wound on the left side of his neck is covered with a white bandage, which moves each time he breathes or tries to open his mouth to speak inaudible words.
It’s been hours since Kaushal has seen any of his family members other than his elder brother Kuldeep (14) who is lying on bed number 16, opposite to him. Kuldeep, too, is injured and he is even more silent than Kaushal with two transparent tubes coming out of his nose.
Kaushal’s mother and grandmother are dead, but he doesn't know that. Two floors below, his father is in the ICU, unable to breathe by himself and still not out of danger. Kaushal doesn’t know that either.
“Secretions,” a nurse said, pointing to Kuldeep’s nose and the little transparent pouch half filled with a dark red liquid. “He is stable but has injuries on his stomach and arm and he is in pain.”
Kuldeep and Kaushal are in ward number 11 of the government hospital along with several other patients injured in Pakistani shelling in the last one week. Their injuries are similar, their grief common.
Kuldeep and Kaushal are residents of Chalyari village in Samba sector that has seen the maximum shelling in the latest spate of cross-border firing. On Wednesday morning, their house was hit by a mortar shell which killed their mother and grandmother. The remaining three injured members of the family admitted to the government hospital, injured and unaware of the two deaths.
“Don’t mention his mother. He doesn’t know she is dead,” said Mahinder Kumar, a relative. Each time Kuldeep drifts into sleep, an uncle gently slaps his cheek and wakes him up. “We have to keep him awake,” he said.
Kaushal has wounds in his scrotum, legs and chest. “A bomb,” was all Kaushal could whisper after trying to form a word for a long time.
More than 75 people have been wounded on the Indian side in the last one week since shelling and firing started from across the border. Most of the villagers living along the border have moved away to “safer areas.” They return in the morning and around noon to feed the cattle and leave before sunset fearing more shelling.
Bano Bibi, 26, was returning home to Jorha farm with her husband, three children and a sister-in-law after spending the night at a school in a safe area. Around 8 a.m., a huge explosion threw them off the tonga they were travelling in.
Ms. Bano, on bed number 6, has splinters in both her legs and arms. She said she was married at 15 and has been working hard in the fields since then. “Now I don’t know what will happen. Will I be able to walk, work and do household chores,” Ms. Bano asked.
Her sister-in-law, Fatima, too has splinters in both her legs and arms. Ms. Bano’s youngest son, Rafiq, is on bed number 8 with a bandaged ear. Her husband, Shahku, has been moved to another ward after being operated for the splinters in his back.
“His condition is worse. He can neither move, nor speak,” said Makhan Din, Shahku’s father.
Meanwhile, in the ICU, Kuldeep and Kaushal’s father, Saudagar Chand, sit propped against a raised bed. A wire wound around his neck is fixed to a transparent tube in the middle of his throat. He cannot speak, nor breathe on his own.
“He thinks his children are fine and their mother and grandmother are with them,” said his brother. “He hopes to join them soon.”

(He is a soft-spoken Gandhian…)
By Asmita
I rushed to meet my father at his office as soon as I heard the news about him winning the Nobel Peace Prize. He didn't seem to be as excited as I was. "Gandhiji should have won it before me." Those were his first words to me.
He is a soft-spoken Gandhian on normal days. Today, he was also unperturbed. I saw him for 15 minutes after the announcement, before the media took over.
My father has, over the years been involved with a host of social issues, from anti-smoking campaigns to his most important work through his NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan , which has helped free and rehabilitate several thousand children from child labour. He is also a big animal lover, calling our dog "our third child".
His work with Bachpan Bachao Andolan, however, has not always been smooth. In their attempt to rescue
children, his team and he have often run into trouble with child traffickers and employers who have threatened and inflicted violence.
He has been attacked several times and threats over the phone at home were not uncommon. I had to go to study in the US because of this. We would get threats at home about me, stuff like that. But he has always been a great father. Despite the threats, we have always supported and understood his wish to reach out and improve the lives of children. My mother, Sumedha Kailash, and elder brother Bhuvan Ribhu, also actively work with my father's NGO.
When he decided to quit his teaching job at a college in Vidisha, my mother's family was very unhappy. They were not too happy anyway, because they had eloped and married. His decision to quit gave my maternal parents another reason to disown my mother. But my mother supported him through very difficult times.
The family has had no time to sit together yet and have a conversation about my father winning the Nobel Prize . I haven't really discussed it with him, but it's a proud moment. Given the recent border violence with Pakistan, it's a great statement for peace, for India and Pakistan.
Some of my father's friends had nominated him earlier for the award. But because the Nobel Peace Prize committee is really secretive, nobody had much idea what was happening. This year it was a complete and total shocker.

Why long-term investors should believe in Infosys  Vishal SikkaCEO
(Company's bonus issue shows…)
The performance of Infosys during the September 2014 quarter confirms what most analysts and investors presume to be true.
The short-term prospects stay bleak and growth will not leapfrog from the current single digits any time soon. But, some of the actions taken by its new CEO Vishal Sikka during the first 70 days of his tenure at the office do signal the management's confidence in the future prospects and a collective effort to move in the right direction.
First, several investors and industry trackers had expressed concerns over the company's strategy to have a pile of idle cash on books — over $4.5 billion or Rs 28,000 crore at the end of September 2014 quarter — and an inability to figure out a way to put it to better use. The company's bonus announcement, almost after a decade, shows Sikka is willing to address the disquiet.
Infosys will offer one bonus equity share for every existing share and 1:1 stock dividend for American Depository Shares. Technically, bonus shares do not have any material impact on shareholders' net worth since the share price will be adjusted downwards once the process of allotment of bonus shares begins after the record date.
But, it does offer an insight into what the management is thinking of the future. This is because bonus shares increase the capital base of the company since a chunk of surplus profit in the balance sheet is converted into equity.
A company that pays dividends regularly and has a responsible management will do this only when it is confident to serve a larger capital base through dividends, and buybacks of shares in the future.
Reasonable Guidance
On the operational front, the company beat estimates with 3.1% sequential growth in revenue at $2.2 billion during the September 2014 quarter and 100 basis points increase in operating margin at 26.1%.
But, it has not revised growth guidance of 7-9% for FY15 - an admission that things cannot improve dramatically overnight, a point that shareholders should appreciate. More so, the second half of a fiscal is historically weak for IT companies due to holidays and budget revisions by clients. This limits chances of a quick recovery.
However, Sikka has taken steps to revamp the existing business including Infosys' universal banking product, Finacle. He has also cited emerging opportunities in the outsourcing space due to new technologies. The objectives are right but they also need right execution and Sikka seems to be geared to take the challenge.
  Attrition to Dip
Higher employee attrition is another major concern that Sikka has tried to address. The number touched a high of 20.1% in the September '14 quarter against 19.5% a quarter ago and 17.3% a year ago. This is likely to come down with Sikka trying to retain talent.
According to recent media reports, the management had undertaken revision of senior management salaries. The company also gave promotions to 12,000 employees — a record for any IT company — during the September quarter besides giving 100% of variable pay to all employees.

Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg meets PM Narendra Modi & IT minister, agrees to partner govt in NOFN project

(Zuckerberg, 30, was on a…)
NEW DELHI: India could be the first country in which Facebook deploys drones to provide broadband connectivity in remote and inaccessible areas, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg proposing a pilot project to bridge this digital divide during his meeting with communications and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday.
According to people familiar with the discussions, the minister sought Facebook as a partner in the National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN) programme, which aims to connect 2.5 lakh village panchayats through high-speed broadband by 2017. "Zuckerberg readily agreed," one of the persons told ET.
He proposed that Facebook could contribute to India's Rs 21,000-crore NOFN project on last-mile connectivity. He spoke of alternate technology such as drones and satellite communications playing a critical part in this last-mile linkage.
"He said the company was keen on testing the pilot project in a few states in India, especially Seemandhra, given the state's emphasis on technology," the person added.
Facebook's Connectivity Lab is actively developing large, inexpensive, solar-powered drones that will be able to fly for years at a time, the division's engineering director Yael Maguire announced earlier this year. These unmanned vehicles will be about the size of a Boeing 747 but weigh only as much as four car tyres while serving as large connectivity hubs.
Keen on India Initiatives
At the Delhi meeting on Friday, Facebook also expressed its willingness to set up a server in India to handle the data transmitted through the drones and other alternative technology and comply with the government's security requirements, according to another person who spoke to ET.
According to people at the hour-long meeting, which included officials of the telecom department and the company, the usually shy billionaire was very forthcoming, listing a number of initiatives in which the Facebook wanted to partner with the Indian government such as e-health, education, providing free basic services and alternative technologies. Facebook didn't respond to ET's request for comment.
Under the government's ambitious Digital India initiative, the government plans use the NOFN project to deliver e-services in areas such as health, education etc to every nook and corner of the country.
However, reaching the end consumer--homes, schools, hospitals and other institutions-—may require wireless technology, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. This is where Facebook senses an opportunity to use its yet-to-be-developed drones.
  Facebook also sought the nomination of senior ministry officials it could liaise with on such projects, to which the minister immediately agreed. "We have dedicated some officials from my ministry to work closely with Facebook on their proposals to expand digital services in the country," Prasad said.
Two joint secretaries - one each from telecom and IT - will be the single-point contacts for the social networking giant, especially on modalities related to the alternate technology, including drones, that Facebook proposes to deploy in India, subject to security clearances.
To be sure, while the Indian government is keen on Facebook's participation in promoting local entrepreneurship and developing localised content for the Digital India programme, it remains to be seen whether it will allow unmanned drones to operate in the country.
The Mumbai police recently raised objections when a food outlet used a four-rotor drone to deliver pizza. Such airborne devices could face questions from the aviation regulator apart from any misgivings the security establishment may have.
Zuckerberg, 30, was on a two-day visit to India, during which he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prasad, besides industry leaders. He also delivered the keynote address at the internet.
org summit. The notfor-profit internet.org partnership was set up last year by Facebook along with mobile phone technology providers Samsung, Mediatek, Qualcomm, Nokia, Opera Software and Ericsson.
It's aimed at providing affordable internet access across the globe. Addressing the summit in the capital on Thursday, Zuckergberg had said that more than 1 billion people in India didn't have access to the Net and that he would discuss this with Modi.
The drones that Facebook is developing would fly at a height of 60,000 to 90,000 feet above the ground, far above commercial jetliners and at a level where they wouldn't be affected by the weather, effectively making them invisible.
In order to continuously provide Wi-Fi coverage, they would be powered by the sun, Maguire had said, adding that these could be tested in the US as early as next year.
Search engine giant Google is another tech firm looking at ways of providing internet access through drones and balloons. In April, Google outbid Facebook for US dronemaker Titan Aerospace. Facebook subsequently acquired UK-based drone company Ascenta for $20 m.

Kailash Satyarthi: A relentless crusader for child rightsKailash Satyarthi’s crusade to save childhood continues; 60 mn still need him
KumKum Dasgupta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 10, 2014
First Published: 14:50 IST(10/10/2014) | Last Updated: 11:49 IST(11/10/2014)
Before he became the second Indian to win the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, not many had heard Kailash Satyarthi’s name.
 
But within 90 minutes of the announcement, the child's rights activist had gained more than 4,500 followers on Twitter--and the list was growing at blazing speed.
 
The 60-year-old activist has been a relentless crusader of child rights and his organisation, the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), has been at the forefront of the drive against child labour in India for years.
Interview: 'The award will benefit the movement'
 
“It was a passion from my childhood to work for children, I carried it forward," said Satyarthi. “I have been very strongly advocating that poverty must not be used as an excuse to continue child labour. It perpetuates poverty. If children are deprived of education, they remain poor.”
Kailash Satyarthi gestures for photographers at this home office after the announcement of him receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, in New Delhi. (AFP Photo)
Satyarthi was trained as an electrical engineer, but he began his work by staging raids on Indian manufacturing, rug-making and other plants where children and their parents often work as bonded labour.
Read:  The highest honour: India’s Nobel Prize connection
 
The Bachpan Bachao Andolan, founded in 1980, has fought child labour by creating domestic and international consumer resistance to products made by bonded children, as well as with direct legal and advocacy work.
 
Building on his initial activism, Satyarthi organised the Global March Against Child Labor in the 1990s -- dedicated to freeing the millions of children abused worldwide in a form of modern slavery.
 
The activist is also founder of RugMark, a widely known international scheme that tags all carpets made in factories that are child-labour free.
Read: Why Kailash Satyarthi deserves the Nobel Peace Prize
 
In 1998, he organised the Global March Against Child Labour across 103 countries, which helped pave the way for an International Labor Organization convention on the worst forms of child labour.
 
He described the plight of children forced into the worst kinds of abusive work in a 2010 interview with the Robert F. Kennedy Centre for Justice and Human Rights.
 
"If they cry for their parents, they are beaten severely, sometimes hanged upside down from trees and even branded or burned with cigarettes," he said.
 
Satyarthi has said his social conscience was awoken when he was six and noticed a boy his age on the steps outside the school with his father, cleaning shoes.
Watch: 'Why I took up the cause of child rights'
Seeing many such children working instead of being educated, he felt an urge as he grew older to solve the problem -- launching him on his career of activism.
 
"I think of it all as a test. This is a moral examination that one has to pass. ... to stand up against such social evils," he said in the Kennedy Centre interview.
 
Through a number of training programmes, Satyarthi also helps children sold to pay off their parents' debts find new lives and serve as agents of prevention within their communities.
 
“The outstanding work that Mr Satyarthi has done over the past 35 years on child labour and trafficking has helped change mindsets and influence communities to protect children’s rights and create a more just society,” Deval Sanghavi, founder of Mumbai-based philanthropic organisation Dasra, told HT.
President Barack Obama on Friday congratulated Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai calling their Nobel “a victory for all who strive to uphold the dignity of every human being”.
Himself a Nobel peace laureate from 2009, Obama also said that despite their difference background, they share an “unshakeable belief in the basic dignity of every girl and boy”.
Read: Satyarthi’s hometown erupts in joy
 
The Bachpan Bachao Andolan was initiated as a grassroot-level and direct-action-oriented people's movement in 1980 to eliminate exploitation of children, especially child labour and child trafficking. The campaign has over 80,000 individuals and 750 organisations as members, who advocate and act for the protection of child rights.
 
One of Satyarthi’s big achievements is the promotion of a consumer awareness campaign in Europe and the US aimed at dissuading consumers from buying carpets made by child labourers and simultaneously endorsing goods produced without exploiting children.
 
Satyarthi uses an array of techniques including lobbying with politicians and knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court, National Human Rights Commission and other judicial institutions for enforcement of child rights laws.

The minimum marriageable age for girls should be revised from 18 to 21 to empower women, said Suchitra Pandit, president of the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI).
Presiding over the “youth mela” organised jointly by the Adolescent Committee of FOGSI, All-Tamil Federation of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ATFOG), and the Department of Women’s Studies of Bharathidasan University here on Friday, Dr. Pandit said that only at the age of 21 women could hope to become economically independent.
T. Ramanidevi, president of Tiruchi Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society; K. Meena, former Vice-Chancellor of Bharthidasan University; and N. Manimekalai, Director and Head of Department of Women’s Studies, spoke.
Earlier, students took out a procession from Salai Road and reached Indira Gandhi College for Women. They carried placards highlighting women’s rights.

After  acche din   Modi govt fooling people with  jaldi thik ho jayega : RahulModi govt fooling people, says Rahul Gandhi
PTI  Saswad, Pune, October 10, 2014

Taking potshots at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Friday said that after promising "achhe din" (good times), he was now fobbing off the people with the assurance that "jaldi thik ho jayega" (things will be alright soon) along the border with Pakistan.
Addressing a campaign rally for Maharashtra assembly polls at Saswad in Pune district, Rahul said that during the Lok Sabha election campaign Modi used to say that he would scare off Pakistan and China. "Last few days have seen ceasefire violations by Pakistan, which had not happened in the last ten years. There are casualties but still Modi says 'jaldi thik ho jayega'," he said.
"Earlier achhe din (good times) were promised. Now people laugh at this slogan," he said.
Don’t expect maturity, wisdom from Rahul: BJP
The Prime Minister had said 'things will be alright soon' at a function recently when a reporter asked him about ceasefire violations by the Pakistani army.
When Modi was sitting on a swing-set with the Chinese president Xi Jingping in Ahmedabad, troops from that country entered the Indian territory, the Congress vice president added.
"But the Prime Minister discussed only investment with China and did not demand that incursions be stopped because what is important for him is his image," Rahul said.
Rubbishing 'the Gujarat model' of development, Rahul said Maharashtra was ahead in every sphere. "Yesterday I was in Haryana which is the leading state in terms of per capita income. Maharashtra is second," he said.
"Our political rivals say nothing has happened in the country in the last 60 years. They come to you in cars manufactured in Pune and speak to you on mobile phones, yet they say nothing has happened. The United States is in awe of our manufacturing and information technology sector and still someone says nothing has happened. Only he is going to fix it all," Rahul said.
The Congress vice president also lauded the way the Congress-led Maharashtra government had dealt with the drought in the state over the last few years.
Earlier, speaking at Wani in Nashik district, Rahul responded to Modi's call for "Congress-free Maharashtra" by saying that Congress can never be banished from the state.
"There is no difference between the ideology of Congress and the thoughts of Shivaji Maharaj, Babasaheb Ambedkar and Jyotiba Phule. How will you remove them from the lives of people?" he said.
He accused the NDA government of working for the benefit of industrialists at the expense of the poor. "We started direct benefit transfer scheme for the poor under which money for social sector schemes like MNREGA was transferred to your bank accounts. Today, they too are continuing with it, but with a difference.
"Before Modi went to the US, a delegation of industrialists from there met him and pleaded for removal of the cap on prices of medicines. A deal was reached behind the doors and now drugs for treating cancer that cost Rs. 8,000 earlier will be available for Rs. one lakh," Rahul alleged.
Similarly, prices of medicines for diabetes, blood pressure and cancer will increase manifold now, he warned.
Rahul also reminded the audience that Congress-led UPA government had amended the land acquisition law for the benefit of the poor and adivasis.

General Electric Co's finance arm is in talks to buy Milestone Aviation Group Ltd , as the US conglomerate looks to expand its aircraft-leasing operation into helicopters, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The purchase price for Milestone could be more than $2.5 billion, according to some of the people, the Journal reported.
Milestone, co-founded by NetJets Inc founder Richard Santulli , has announced plans for an initial public offering of stock, according to the report.
Buying Milestone, the world's largest helicopter-leasing company by fleet value, would broaden GE Capital Aviation Services' portfolio beyond the competitive plane-leasing business, as it currently owns no helicopters, the Journal said.
"As a matter of policy, we don't comment on market rumors or speculation," a spokeswoman for Milestone Aviation said.
Officials at General Electric were not immediately available for comment.

NEW DELHI: The unprecedented floods in Jammu and Kashmir are going to cause havoc with the finances of four public sector insurance companies, which will now have to shell out Rs 4,000 crore to settle claims without any verification.
Given the degree of devastation caused by the floods, the J&K High Court had directed the PSU insurance companies to pay 95% of the claim amount of those who had taken insurance cover for Rs 25 lakh or less and 50% for those claims by persons who had taken cover for more than Rs 25 lakh.
Attorney general Mukul Rohatgi on Friday pleaded with the Supreme Court on behalf of the insurance companies that this HC order was open to abuse by unscrupulous elements and these companies be permitted to at least conduct a preliminary survey of the damage before settling claims.
He said the companies were ready with cheques worth Rs 25 crore to settle the claims but it must be done after preliminary or at least a cursory survey. "We have deputed more than 9,000 surveyors in the flood affected areas," he said.
A bench of Chief Justice H L Dattu, S A Bobde and A M Sapre refused to accept the AG's contention and said, "You just have 99 surveyors in the field and those small shop keepers whose goods were under water for days together, what will they be left with? They must get immediate relief as they have suffered heavily. Not even one shop could be opened in Lal Chowk which was under water for more than a week."
The AG gave an undertaking that all claims would be settled by November 30. He said if an actual estimate of the damage to insured properties and vehicles was taken, it would not exceed Rs 1,000 crore. But, by this omnibus order, the HC had cast a burden of Rs 4,000 crore.
But the apex court was not persuaded to review the HC order. It suggested to the insurance companies to take an undertaking from the persons filing claims that if the damage did not match the claim, the excess money paid would be recovered. However, the apex court was unwilling to put this down in its order.
Taking into account the AG's apprehension that it could be misused by unscrupulous elements, the bench said, "If there is a little misuse in such a situation, let it be."
This would make the insurance companies susceptible to similar claims in other flood affected areas, where affected persons would cite the Supreme Court order refusing companies to even conduct preliminary survey of the damage before settling claims.
Assam and parts of north-eastern states faced similar flood situation like in Jammu and Kashmir after unprecedented rains. Will the residents of flood affected areas in Assam and other states approach the state high courts for similar relief?
The CJI had on Sunday visited Srinagar and inspected the impact of flood on courts and surrounding areas. The SC asked state advocate general Muhammad Ishaq Qadri to ensure that the state high court and district courts resumed normal functioning by Monday.

Annabelle: The soul goes missingDirector: John Leonetti
Cast: Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, Tony Amendola
Last year James Wan’s “The Conjuring” proved that creaking doors could still shake you in your boots if there is a compelling story unravelling behind them. This prequel to the Warrens’ tryst with apparitions is literally dolled up to feed on the fear generated by the original. Director John Leonetti who shot “The Conjuring” is good at setting up the atmosphere but doesn’t know how to blend the panic with the poignant, so crucial for a horror story to strike or slash a chord.
It starts well with Annbelle Wallis and Ward Horton, as Mia and John respectively, generating a familiar setting of an adorable couple expecting their first child. Their care and concerns seem real and relatable. So when one night Mia sees blood on her window panes it startles you for you fear what lies ahead for these charming people. But what we get are the familiar tropes of doors making sounds, a television set and a sewing machine playing truant and a doll levitating to perilous proportions. The mumbo jumbo of a satanic cult on a soul searching mission doesn’t hold.
Somehow the danger doesn’t seem real despite the fact that Leonetti has used the safest premise to bring the audience to the edge. A pregnant woman is both the most vulnerable and the strongest being. She doesn’t want her life blossoming in her womb to be harmed by even a feather and she can go to any length to save the unborn child.
This bond has often been attacked on screen by demonic spirits but here Leonetti could conjure up only some manipulative moments around the mother and the infant. Apart from a couple of master strokes even the camera angles fall into a pattern.
You can make out that Leonetti is not really in a mood to go for the kill. And in horror it spells hara-kiri!
Bottomline: A lame backstory to The Conjuring

Government moves SC against 3G roaming agreement3G intra-circle roaming
(In April, the telecom disputes…)
NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday moved the Supreme Court , challenging the legality of the 3G intra-circle roaming pacts that allow carriers to offer services in circles where they don't possess 3G bandwidth.
The development once again casts shadow on the future of Bharti Airtel , Vodafone India and Idea's 3G services in circles where they do not have 3G airwaves but are offering it using each other's' network. Tata Teleservices , Aircel and Reliance Communications have also entered into a similar pact among themselves.
In April, the telecom disputes tribunal, TDSAT, had overturned the DoT's ban on the 3G intra-circle roaming (3G ICR) pacts, saying Bharti Airtel, Idea and Vodafone's roaming arrangements for 3G airwaves with each other in circles where one of them didn't possess the airwaves was legal.
GSM industry lobby group COAI has said the move to challenge the TDSAT verdict will lead to a tumult in the industry.
COAI secretary-general Rajan S Mathews said the move would inject further uncertainty and dampen the telecom sector's growth story.
The issue has been a bone of contention between the two sides. The government first banned the arrangement in 2011 on grounds that it amounted to sharing of spectrum, which is not permitted even today. The telecom operators, on the other hand, claimed that the telecom department had clearly communicated in queries raised on the 3G spectrum auction rules that 3G roaming pacts would be permitted.
Citing the 2G intra-circle roaming arrangements allowed under the telecom permits, the TDSAT had said that the provision for ICR was already embedded in the telecom licences.
The two judge bench headed by Justice Aftab Alam had come down heavily on the government for not allowing operators to enter into roaming pacts despite clarifying their doubts on the issue earlier.
The bench had also quashed theRs 1,200-crore penalty levied on the operators for entering into roaming pacts.
COAI has said that operators were already complaining of spectrum shortage and that is why suggestive guidelines for spectrum sharing have come up from the sector's regulator. DoT's move will prove to be a spoilsport for telcos. "We should move forward and ensure that the 3G ICR provision be optimised to reap maximum benefits for the people who would be provided more coverage, better quality data services and more options across the country," Mathews added.

Ericsson bags 4G deal from Airtel  two more from IdeaEricsson bags 4G deal from Bharti Airtel, secures two more from Idea Cellular

4G network
(TDD-LTE, which uses 2300…)
NEW DELHI: Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson on Thursday said it has secured a contract from India's No.1 telecom carrier Bharti Airtel for supply of base stations and other equipment for its 4G network.
Ericsson did not disclose the size of the deal, which is the first in the country for rolling out services using the FDD-LTE technology.
People close to the development said the company has also signed some other smaller deals with Bharti and Idea Cellular.
"We have got a network infrastructure deal from them (Airtel), which include base stations and other equipment," Chris Houghton, head of region-India at Ericsson, told ET. "Though, I can't comment on specifics of the deal."
Ericsson, which has around 45% share in the global 4G LTE market, introduced its small cell radio dot system along with a multi-band indoor picocell, which aims to solve challenges mobile operators would face with coverage within buildings, especially in 4G.
Ericsson's 4G network deal for Airtel's high-speed data services on the 1800 Mhz band using the FDD-LTE technology marks the first step towards rolling out 4G in India on a technology that is more widely accepted globally, compared with the TDD-LTE technology .
TDD-LTE, which uses 2300 Mhz band frequency, has technical limitations because of which Bharti and Aircel have rolled out services in only a few cities. Reliance Jio Infocomm, which has a pan-India licence to offer 4G on the TDD-LTE standard, has not launched services so far.
Besides Jio and Airtel, some other telcos such as Vodafone India and Idea won spectrum in the 1800 Mhz band in the auctions held in February. This spectrum can also be used for 4G on the FDD-LTE technology in future.
Airtel, in fact, won airwaves in the band in 15 circles including Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. Hougton though said that it would take time for 4G to go mass market in India, but added that the adoption will be much quicker than previous generation technologies such as 2G and 3G.
"Today, only 12% of Indian operators' revenue comes from data and that will increase definitely once these next gen networks are in place and smartphone become cheaper," he said.
People in the know said the separate one-year deal between Ericsson and Airtel is for the former to provide its prepaid self-care solutions to the latter.
The deal covers Bharti Airtel's Night Store, a first of its kind store that enables customers to buy value-for-money offers on their prepaid mobile for internet usage and local calling at night (12 midnight to 6 am).
Airtel's Night Store is available in Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Chennai, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Mumbai, Tamil Nadu, UP (West), J&K, West Bengal, Bihar, Rajasthan, North East and Assam telecom circles.
Ericsson had earlier secured a five-year deal from Vodafone India for managing pre-paid charging system for the company's nearly 75 million customers spread across five circles.
The world's largest network equipment maker has also bagged two other deals from Aditya Birla Group company Idea Cellular. One of the people said Idea has selected Ericsson for real-time charging for its post-paid subscriber base. The telco has also awarded an Evolved IP Network (EIN) solutions data charging deal to Ericsson.
Ericsson's EIN solution delivers subscriber broadband services, such as triple-play, 2G/3G/4G and Wi-Fi over a unified IP transport using VPNs. The solution was launched in February.
Emails sent to Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular did not elicit any response, while Ericsson did not answer ET's query on Airtels' Night Store deal and Idea Cellular agreements.
"The deals further show that how telecom operators are not only spending on network, but also on operational excellence for improved customer experience after the reduced regulatory overhang," said Rohan Dhamija, partner and head of India and South Asia at Analysys Mason.

India not killing Pak civilians deliberately:BSFArnia
(Pakistan fired at Indian…)
NEW DELHI: India is not targeting Pakistani civilians deliberately, Border Security Force (BSF) director-general DK Pathak has said, drawing a sharp contrast with firing from across the border.
Pakistan fired at Indian posts on the night before Dussehra even after BSF had chosen not to retaliate after the first incident on October 2 evening following Pakistan's loss to India in the Asiad hockey final.
Answering Pakistan's criticism of India killing its civilians, Pathak said the majority of Pakistani border outposts along the international border are either located inside Pakistani villages or abut the villages, leading to civilian casualties there as a result of Indian shelling.
"However, our border outposts are at a distance from our villages. So, Pakistan is deliberately targeting our villages and civilians by heavy shelling, which continued even till Thursday morning. We are only firing at Pakistani border outposts, which is unfortunately causing civilian casualties there," Pathak told ET on Thursday. Pathak also revealed BSF had not retaliated after the first incident of heavy firing by Pakistani Rangers on October 2 evening at Peetal Post in Jammu's Arnia sector.
"This was within three hours of Pakistan's loss in the Asiad hockey cup to India — that could be a probable reason for the firing that continues till today. Our sub-inspector then spoke to his counterpart asking why they were firing and Pakistani Rangers said it was a gunfight between two criminal groups behind their border outpost. We questioned how the bullets in that case could land at India's post but we did not retaliate on that occasion. It was only after Pakistani forces fired again on October 2 night that we retaliated with equal force. Pakistan accuses us of firing on them on Eid Eve, but why did they fire at us on Dussehra Eve on October 2 night?" Pathak asked.
Jitendra Singh , MoS in PMO, said civilians on the Indian side are backing the country's strong response despite being dislocated from their homes.
"The response given to Pakistani firing by UPA was apologetic at best. People at the border say response is now fitting and say they will tolerate the temporary discomfort of dislocation from their homes for the sake of Pakistan being taught a strong lesson. They want Pakistani guns to be silenced once and for all," Singh said.
Pathak added there has been complete radio silence on the border since October 2. "The last time when firing took place in August, we had taken the initiative and called them a couple of times, asking them to deescalate.
But this time, we have decided to make no such calls. Pak has also not reached out to us with any offer either. The only exchange has been of protest letters between both forces at designated points in which Pak has been levelling baseless allegations that we initiated the firing," Pathak said.

India cannot give Pakistan Army befitting replyIndia cannot give Pakistan Army befitting reply

Major General (Retd) Ashok K Mehta
Ceasefire violations occur cyclically, often premeditated but invariably linked to unresolvable Kashmir masla. Feuding local commanders testing the mettle of new battalions on LoC, tit-fortat responses and infiltration are the usual provocations for exchange of fire across the line.
Someone who has spent onethird of his youthful time astride the line, I understand what the Army calls the dynamics of LoC.
Nine out of 10 times, it is the autonomous Pak military that initiates the firing, though there is no way to ascertain this in the absence of the UNMOGIP (United Nations Military Observer Group for India-Pakistan), sensibly derecognised by India after the Shimla agreement.
This time around, additional reasons have been offered for the current round of firing — political instability, civil-army power struggle, elections in J&K and the creme de la creme testing Modi. "Pakistan should stop ceasefire violations now and understand the reality that times have changed in India," thundered home minister Rajnath Singh . This is reminiscent of BJP leaders asking Pak to lay off Kashmir after the nuclear tests in 1998. Soon Pak did its own nuclear tests, achieving parity.
"There is a new government in India with 282 seats and the world now recognises India" is the common refrain but this will not wash with Pak. With 489 seats late Rajiv Gandhi had to seek a meeting with General Zia ul Haq to defuse Operation Brasstacks in 1986 which was threatening to blow up into a war. The simple fact is that India has not developed a decisive, conventional military superiority to give Pakistan army a befitting reply. So what you get instead is 'Act Tough' rhetoric amounting to disproportionate response — no flag meetings, no DGMO talks and not even political talks unless Pak stops firing.
This is not remotely akin to the frequently touted muscular and robust foreign and security policy of the Modi government. On Air Force Day, on Wednesday, when asked by reporters on border firing, PM Modi responded with five words, "Jaldi sab theek ho jayega." Because this cycle of small arms and mortar fire has caused deaths of mainly civilians on both sides, as soldiers are inside bunkers, and is leading to the law of diminishing results, Mr Modi's words are prophetic.
Pak army has achieved its immediate objective of internationalising Kashmir, pushing in infiltrators and testing Modi. You do not need ISRO scientists to tell you that Modi could not have acted differently from what Army chief General Dalbir Suhag has advised — bullet for bullet, mortar shell for mortar shell but confining the military action to tactical level without escalation.
We in India must get accustomed to increased frequency and intensity of flare-ups on LoC. Some divine force — read US — has managed to restrain Pak army after Mumbai 2008 terror attacks from using its strategic assets like Lashkar-e-Taiba and other loonies from staging cross-border terrorist attacks on Indian mainland. The gap between major attacks is seven years. So watch out for 2015, once US withdraws from Afghanistan and loses interests in the region.
In the interregnum, the punching bag will remain LoC where the Pak army will expresses its rage and defiance over civilian control and arch-enemy India. Pakistan NSA Sartaj Aziz has been bending over backwards for resumption of dialogue.
Firing will peter out soon setting the stage for next month's Saarc summit in Kathmandu. Mr Modi, the acclaimed new messiah of Saarc spirit, will just have one option — to initiate the revival of needlessly stalled dialogue.
Detractors will contend that it is not PM Nawaz Sharif but Gen Raheel Sharif with whom we should talk. That's baloney.

Apple to start midnight sales for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in India for first time
Writankar Mukherjee & Gulveen Aulakh, ET Bureau Oct 10, 2014, 03.39AM IST
(Only 29% of more than 900…)
KOLKATA| NEW DELHI: With record pre-launch orders for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Apple will start midnight sales for its devices in India for the first time, in line with the practice it follows elsewhere.
The phones are to be launched in India on October 17. More than 5,000 of the new handsets have been reserved at Apple stores, multi-brand retail chains and e-commerce sites in the last two days, according to three senior trade executives. Sales to those who have booked the phones will start midnight at The MobileStore, UniverCell, Planet M Retail and Sangeetha Mobiles outlets besides Apple stores.
"The craze about iPhones is for the first time felt in India like in the West," said Himanshu Chakrawarti, CEO, The Mobile Store. "The exclusivity to own the first lot of iPhones before others is huge, much like when a Salman Khan movie releases or how consumers used to rush at midnight to buy the first lot of Harry Potter books."
Videocon-owned PlanetM Retail's chief executive Sanjay Karwa said the midnight launch will ensure traditional offline retailers have the advantage over online retail, which is creating market disruptions. "Midnight launch is a new concept in India and Apple's move will ensure brick-and-mortar customers receive the handset first.
We will keep a few of our stores open past midnight to fulfill all orders, since getting permission for that is also a hassle," Karwa said. Trade sources said Infibeam, Apple's sole authorised online seller for iPhones in India, has clocked the highest number of bookings — in excess of 2,000 — with big demand from companies and smaller towns.
The maximum orders are for the 128 GB iPhone 6 priced at Rs 71,500. Infibeam.com co-founder Neeru Sharma declined to confirm the numbers, but said there had been unprecedented demand for the new iPhones and that it will try and ensure deliveries in metro cities and towns on October 17 itself. Last year, Apple's iPhone 5s had around 2,000 bookings in India, where the concept of pre-order is still new.
Rival Samsung took pre-launch orders for its Galaxy S4 and S5, with those for the S5 at about 2,500, according to trade sources. An email sent to Apple did not elicit any responses as of the press time. Apple has assured retailers that it will ensure sufficient inventory for all pre-ordered units on the launch day.
The concern that there could be a shortage due to strong demand in the West remains. Also, the launch date of the new iPhones in India coincides with that in China, a far bigger market for smartphones and Apple. Only 29% of more than 900 million mobile phone subscribers in India have smartphones, while in China the user base is around 500 million.
Infibeam's chief executiveofficer Vishal Mehta said there could be a demand-and-supply-gap for the new iPhones due to a high demand. The 4.7-inch iPhone 6 starts at Rs 53,500 while the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus starts at Rs 62,500. Globally, Apple sold a record 10 million units in three days after the launch on September 19 in 10 markets.

Reviews have started pouring in for Apple's newly launched  iOS 8, and not every one is heaping praise with the new operating system.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
iOS 8 is out and the reviews have begun trickling in. Apple's latest OS got off to a rough start. The initial launch was buggy, to say the least, and Apple's attempt to fix it just made things worse.
It's worth noting that not all of iOS 8's major features are functional yet. Apple Pay, for instance, is expected to come online when Apple releases iOS 8.1 later this month.
Users have already begun forming their opinions on iOS 8 though. We found out what people detest most about the update.
Here is a list of complaints:
Complaint No 1: The "Recently Deleted" album on iOS 8 is my worst nightmare.
Complaint No 2: iOS 8 is killing my 5S battery.
Complaint No 3: URLs no longer work in calendar invites. Every teleconference is painful.
Complaint No 4: The Tips app is the worst, really.
Complaint No 5: iOS 8 issues with location services ... can't enable them.
Complaint No 6: The new Safari on iOS 8 is the worst browser I've ever had the displeasure of using.
Complaint No 7: My autocorrect is way worse since this iOS 8 update.
Complaint No 8: Every app I have keeps crashing.
Complaint No 9: Camera Roll is my biggest complaint.
Complaint No 10: No new emojis!
Complaint No 11: The worst part is the Family Share. I can't even update my apps.

Apple Inc will have at least three days to review and potentially move to bar any information about its relationship with GT Advanced Technologies Inc that may arise during the latter's bankruptcy hearings, the court said in a ruling on Thursday.
GT Advanced, which struck an agreement last year to supply sapphire for Apple's iPhone and other mobile devices, filed for bankruptcy on Monday.
In Thursday's ruling, U.S. Judge Henry Boroff said GT Advanced should provide any reasonable information as part of the case, "except that in the event that any such information relates to the details of the debtors' business relationship with Apple."
In such cases, the information must first be disclosed to Apple's lawyers at least three days beforehand, during which time the iPhone maker can move to block such disclosure, Boroff wrote in the ruling.

Festive special: Tarla Dalal s masala mathriMakes 5 mathris
 
Rajasthani cooking has been influenced by the war-like lifestyle of its inhabitants and the ingredients available in this region. Food that will last for several days and that can be eaten without heating was preferred, more out of necessity than choice. Crispy, flaky and superbly flavoured deep fried 'mathris' or 'mathis' have probably emerged from this style of cooking. This popular 'any time' snack can be stored for several days. Mathris are eaten with a spicy mango or lemon pickle and are often served with tea. Sometimes they even form part of an easy breakfast with milk. Large mathris - plain or stuffed - are pinched on their surface with floral and other intricate designs and they are a 'must' for all occasions including marriages, poojas etc. Rajasthanis are fond of storing large jars of mathris which they can munch at any time of the day.
Ingredients
1 cup plain flour (maida)
1/4 tsp carom seeds (ajwain)
1/2 tsp cumin seeds (jeera)
1 tsp chilli powder
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper (kalimirch)
1 tbsp melted ghee
salt to taste
Combine all the ingredients in a deep bowl and knead into a stiff dough using enough water.
Divide the dough into 5 equal portions.
Roll out one portion of the dough into a 100 mm. (4”) diameter circle.
Pinch the edges of the rolled mathri to form a design
Prick the mathri equally all over with a fork.
Repeat steps 3 to 5 to make 4 more mathris.
Heat the oil in a deep non-stick kadhai and deep-fry, a few mathris at a time, on a medium flame for 8 to 10 minutes or till they turn golden brown in colour.
Drain on an absorbent paper and store it in an air-tight container and use as required.

Harsh words replaced crossfire at the Line of Control and the International Border, which went silent for the first time in two weeks.
Sources confirmed to The Hindu that diplomatic initiatives between India and Pakistan have brought the situation under control for the moment.
The External Affairs Ministry issued its first public statement on the crisis, calling on Pakistan to “restore peace and tranquillity.” “It is for Pakistan to escalate or de-escalate. Pakistan and its security forces need to end adventurism along the border and LoC,” spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said. Government sources told The Hindu that diplomats in New Delhi and Islamabad had been in close contact for the past few days.

At a rally in Maharashtra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his toughest statement against Pakistan’s aggression at the border yet, saying, “Indian jawans have shut Pakistan’s mouth.”
In Islamabad, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif chaired a National Security Council meeting, including the service chiefs. Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed India for “unprovoked violations” of the ceasefire, but said “war is not an option.”

Finland was stripped of its pristine AAA long-term credit rating Friday as a top ratings agency views threats to the nation’s economy. Just 12 nations still have perfect ratings.
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service cut its long-term foreign credit rating on the Nordic country by one notch to AA+ — just as investors are getting increasingly worried about Europe’s economy.
It’s the latest nation to be stripped of its perfect AAA rating — leaving just 12 countries in the world at AAA. The U.S. lost its AAA rating from S&P in August 2011. Separately, S&P downgraded the outlook on France’s debt to negative to stable — in just the latest blow to investors’ perception of Europe. France’s debt is still rated AA.
Finland was taken down a notch for a bevy of reasons cited by S&P, including a downward revision to the nation’s economic future. A tougher economy means the nation might have a more difficult time cutting public debt.
S&P spelled out its rationale for the downgrade in one sentence: “The downgrade reflects our view of the risk that the Finnish economy could experience protracted stagnation because of its aging population and shrinking workforce, weakening external demand, loss of global market share in the key information technology sector, structural retrenchment of the important forestry sector, and relatively rigid labor market,” it said in the report.
Finland’s downgrade is just the latest in what’s been a whittling down of the credit health of the world’s nations.
The nations that still have AAA ratings from S&P include:

Fuel prices to slump but govt may wait to fr...Hefty fuel price cut in near future but government may wait to free up diesel
By Sanjay Datta, TNN | 11 Oct, 2014, 10.14AM IST
The continued low  global oil prices  would allow the government to breathe easy as the macroeconomic environment improves substantially.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Hefty cut in fuel prices are round the corner as global benchmark oil prices continue to fall, dropping below $90 a barrel on Friday as Iran joined Saudi Arabia in a discount war— something unthinkable till now.
The continued low global oil prices would allow the government to breathe easy as the macroeconomic environment improves substantially. But the Centre is unlikely to deregulate diesel pricing in a hurry, opting instead for periodic price modulation to avoid future shock in case crude prices rebound.
Crude prices have remained depressed mainly due to four factors: Rise in output from Iraq and Libya in spite of the unrest in the region, receding hopes of an immediate uptick in the Eurozone economy , tepid growth in China's appetite and new players such as Russia and US nibbling at the markets fed by traditional suppliers.
Oil prices have dropped over 20% since June, with global benchmark Brent testing $88.44 a barrel on Friday as Iran matched Saudi Arabia's discount of over $1 a barrel to retain market share amid traditional consumers who are increasingly looking at new sources.
The mix of crude India buys also averaged $90.5 on Thursday and is expected to reflect Friday's fall on Monday. As an immediate effect, consumers can expect another cut in petrol price next week. The government would pare diesel price by Rs 3 a litre or so in October once polls get over in Maharashtra and Haryana.
A hefty cut in diesel price would bring down road and rail freight. Since this would coincide with winter crops and vegetables starting to flow into the market, the impact at consumer level is expected to get amplified by way of a sharp reduction in the prices of rice, pulses and vegetables, thereby bringing down inflation.
On the macroeconomic front, low oil prices would reduce the oil import bill and mean lesser outflow of foreign exchange. This would ease current account deficit. The fuel subsidy burden would also come down drastically, especially with over-recovery in diesel touching Rs 2.50 a litre at last count. All these would have a bearing on the government's fiscal deficit situation, which in turn would reduce the imperative to hike taxes and a positive impact on interest rate regime.
All these would happen even without officially deregulating diesel, though the pressure from private fuel retailers to open up the market would increase. But the winter demand is round the corner, which many producing countries expect would help prices to rebound. It remains to be seen whether the government would deregulate diesel quickly or prefer to wait and watch the shifting sands of global oil market.

BANGALORE: NR Narayana Murthy declined to take up the ceremonial title of chairman emeritus at the company he founded citing Infosys' high corporate governance standards and (the need) to avoid any perceived conflicts.
When Infosys announced appointment of Vishal Sikka as CEO in June, it said Murthy would be designated chairman emeritus— a title designated to him in 2011, after he stepped down from Infosys' board. With all seven founders retiring, Infosys will seek the approval of Sebi to reclassify them as public shareholders instead of promoter-shareholders.
"The founders have neither association with the company nor exercise any control over the affairs of the company," Infosys said.
The founders and their family members, together, own 15.94% stake in Infosys. If the reclassification is allowed, promoter-shareholding in the company will fall to zero. Earlier this week, at a farewell for Kris Gopalakrishnan , the last of Infosys' cofounders to retire from the company, Murthy said the biggest highlight of his over-three-decade journey at Infosys was seeing the company listed at Nasdaq in 1993.
"Sitting on a tri-stool in front of scorching lights at Nasdaq and being the first Indian company to be listed on the exchange...I borrowed words of Neil Armstrong and said it's a small step for Nasdaq but a giant leap for the Indian software industry. I think that was the high point," said Murthy.
Murthy, however, declined to share any low points in his long journey, saying: "I don't know if there has been any low point, because I do things in a very positive way."

Cricket  Bollywood come together to feed fans  hunger for stardoomAlibaba
(ISL is a smaller operation.…)
NEW DELHI: When Athletico de Kolkata host Mumbai City FC at the 68,000-seater Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday, it will see India's two big passions -- Bollywood and cricket - come together with the hope of creating a third one that pulls the masses, feeds their hunger for stardom, brings in the money and is for keeps.
They have basked in, or seen, the rush for the Indian Premier League (IPL), the city-based cricket league. But they will find the Indian Super League (ISL), football's answer to the IPL in India, to be a different ballgame, one that will take a lot more to come together and will need much more time to do so. "We should reach close to breakeven by year five," admits Gaurav Modwel, CEO of FC Pune City, the Pune franchise. "In the long run, I think, it might be bigger than the IPL."
There are many parallels between the ISL and IPL models. They are both city-based sporting leagues, with eight teams each. The bulk of a team's revenues come from dividing what is called the 'central pool' in the IPL, which comprises TV rights and principal sponsorships.
In IPL, this central pool was substantial from the start and has since grown further. It's what enabled cricket franchises operating on annual costs of Rs 100-150 crore to post a profit or, at worst, end with a marginal loss.
ISL is, by comparison, a smaller operation. Each team is looking at an average annual cost of Rs 50 crore. It's not yet clear how much revenue they will end up with. A crude calculation done by ET, based on individual metrics provided by stakeholders in the league, suggest that teams are looking at a loss of Rs 20-30 crore in year one.
Besides the lower popularity of football, ISL also presents fewer --and smaller -- opportunities to monetise than IPL. Take advertising. A three-hour IPL match offers about 40-42 minutes of TV advertising, spaced out between overs.
By comparison, a 90-minute game of football only has a single break, of 15 minutes. "In this, seven-eight minutes will be for ads and the rest for programming," says Sanjay Gupta, chief operating officer at STAR India, the broadcaster and co-promoter of ISL. In addition, there will be about four minutes on either side of the match. That's about 16 minutes in all.
In the case of IPL, since TV rights were sold, the size of the central pool was known at the outset. In ISL, since STAR India is a co-promoter, along with sports management firm IMG and Reliance Industries, it is not paying any TV rights money. What comes to the central pool from the TV side is effectively a function of how many ads can be sold.
According to two stakeholders who didn't want to be named, at least half of these 16 minutes will go to the league sponsors. Hero MotoCorp is the principal sponsor, Maruti Suzuki the associate sponsor and Pepsi, Puma, Nice Gel and Muthoot Finance the remaining sponsors. Hero is paying Rs 54 crore for three years and Maruti Rs 20-22 crore, says a senior official of a media-buying firm representing a sponsor on condition of anonymity. "It always helps to get in early," says Manohar Bhat, vice president, marketing, Maruti Suzuki, while declining to reveal the sponsorship amount. "We are betting on the fact that it will be a success."
In the first year, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that if STAR sells eight minutes of ads per match at Rs 1 lakh per 10 seconds -- the rate for the recently concluded Fifa World Cup -- it will earn about Rs 29 crore from TV advertising.
Extrapolating the numbers reportedly paid by Hero and Maruti, the best-case scenario for sponsorship is about Rs 41 crore.
That's a total central pool of about Rs 70 crore. Of this, about 60-70% of central revenue is expected to be split among the eight teams -- or Rs 6-7 crore per team. Other revenue streams are expected to fetch teams about Rs 15 crore, resulting in a net loss of about Rs 15 crore.
It still might not be a bad longterm business, feels Vinit Karnik, national director, sports and live events at GroupM ESP. "Profit and loss is not the only metric to look at ISL," he says. "It's eventually a valuations game."
One lever for valuations is what makes India a 'can't-ignore' for global business and sport: its population, next only to China. About 150 million TV viewers in India watch soccer, primarily the European soccer leagues. "The challenge, however, is how are we going to convert the followers of European football to Indian football," says Karnik.
ISL franchises will look for tie-ups with global clubs. It's a symbiotic relationship. The foreign clubs can feed the Indian clubs marquee players; the Indian clubs can provide the foreign clubs new fans.
"Look at what happened in Chinese football," says Sameer Manchanda, chairman and managing director of DEN Networks , which owns the Delhi franchise. "Alibaba recently bought a 50% stake in Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club for around $192 million," he says. "This is the kind of opportunity we are looking at in ISL too."

Competition season for pigeon racingUpdated: October 11, 2014 11:41 IST
Competition season for pigeon racing

THE HINDU THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, KERALA, 28/09/2014: Pigeon flyer Edison with his birds in Thiruvananthapuram on September 28, 2014. Photo: S. Mahinsha
Shading their eyes with their palms, the pigeon owners scanned the harsh noon sky for raptors: those fast-moving specks of dark that could spell sudden death for their prize birds. 
It is competition season for pigeon owners in the city and trained birds are at a premium. On their small roof-top coop at Ilipode, near the city, Edison and Murali, both award-winners, are coaching a fresh flock of prize birds for the next endurance flying contest. They have money to make and a reputation to protect. In similar less well off neighbourhoods, scores of other enthusiastic pigeon owners are also training their birds with equal zeal.
Pigeon racing is almost a subculture among the city’s working class population. It has its own set of rules, referees, rivalries, myths, star fliers and breeders. Raptors have always been the worst enemy of pigeon owners. Sreekumar, a veteran based in Chakka, says the predatory birds have been unusually active over the city in recent years.
He has lost more than a score of birds to raptors this season. He says most owners have adapted to the threat by training their pigeons at night when the predators retire to their eyries to roost. They turn searchlights to the sky to guide the birds. 
C.K. Vishnu, an ornithologist, said drastic reduction of natural hunting grounds due to urbanisation, climate change and deforestation could have prompted predatory birds to move to cities.
He said raptors such as the migratory Peregrine Falcon, Shikra, and the Crested Goshawk have been increasingly spotted roosting on high-rises and mobile phone towers.  Raptors are not the only threat to pigeon owners. The sport has an unseen criminal side to it. Theft of prize birds is common. Criminal gangs have set on fire pigeon coops of their rivals following disputes over decision of referees and ownership of birds. However, the sport has endured largely due to its ardent fan following.

Confident that Sikka will transform Infosys: Narayana Murthyet now
("Vishal Sikka is a wonderful…)
NEW DELHI: Stating that IT companies must focus on innovation and not just cost optimisation, NR Narayana Murthy told ET Now that he is confident that Vishal Sikka will transform Infosys.
"Vishal Sikka is a wonderful leader, excited about the future," Murthy told ET Now. "Vishal Sikka is a professional CEO, brings best of both worlds," he added.
Vishal Sikka, Infosys' new CEO on Friday outlined his key focus areas for the IT major and said that he is looking forward to 'transforming Infosys into an agile, innovative company'.
Infosys Technologies, India's second-largest IT services exporter, on Friday beat market expectations with a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs 3,096 crore for the second quarter of the current financial year, versus an ET NOW Poll of Rs 2,864.4 crore.
This is a rise of 7.2% QoQ, from Rs 2,886 crore in the previous quarter. The company retained the FY15 revenue guidance at 7%-9%.
The IT major reported a sales figure of Rs 13,342 crore versus an ET NOW Poll of Rs 13,223.6 crore. The company's board approved a bonus issue of 1:1. Infosys also declared an interim dividend of Rs 30/share.
The Q2 EBIT margin came in at 26.1% versus 25.14% QoQ. In dollar terms, the NYSE-listed firm's net profits grew 33.4 per cent to $511 million in second quarter of this fiscal from $383 million in the year-ago period.
In dollar terms, the company's revenues rose 6.5 per cent to $2.2 billion in the July-September quarter of 2014-15 fiscal from $2.07 billion in the same quarter of previous financial year.
The Q2 attrition was at 20.1%. The company's gross addition of employees stood at 14,255 during the quarter. Infosys and its subsidiaries added 49 clients (gross) during the quarter.
Commenting on the results, Vishal Sikka said, "Digital transformation is reshaping the business of every one of our clients. We see this as a great opportunity to help them renew the core of their business as well as to expand into new frontiers and are seeing early positive results." "Our strategy is to apply the same principles to our own business in order to capture this opportunity and accelerate our growth, within our culture of lifelong learning and purposeful work," he added.

Vishal Sikka's Infosys beats estimates, Q2 net up 28.6%
ET Bureau Oct 11, 2014, 03.33AM IST
(Infosys, India's second…)
BANGALORE: Infosys announced better-than-expected revenue and profit growth for the July-September quarter and cheered investors with a generous dividend and bonus.
The Bangalore-based company's profit grew 28.6% in the second quarter. However, Friday was dominated by CEO Vishal Sikka's enumeration of the strategic direction in which he is leading the country's secondlargest software exporter.
Sikka, 47, the first non-founder to take the top job at the Bangalore-based company, promised to remake Infosys as a "next-generation company" as he attempts to balance the twin priorities of pushing growth momentum in the traditional business while preparing to compete for leadership in technology areas such as social, mobile, cloud computing and data analytics.
"We not only aspire for consistent and profitable growth but indeed to get back to being a bellwether company for the industry," said Sikka, a former member of the board at German software company SAP who took over as CEO in August after founder N R Narayana Murthy surprisingly decided to step away after returning as chairman last June. "And we want to do that on the basis of innovation, on the basis of technology."
Infosys kicked off earnings season with second-quarter revenue of $2,201 million. At 3.2%, revenue growth over the previous quarter was robust by Infosys' standards and good augury for the rest of the industry.
The company did not, however, alter its guidance of 7-9% growth for the year to March 2015. Software body Nasscom has forecast 13-15% growth for the industry. Operating margin improved by 100 basis points to 26.1%.
Dividend of Rs 30 a Share
Consolidated net profit rose to Rs 3,096 crore in the July-September quarter, 2014-15, from Rs 2,407 crore in the year-ago period. "On several fronts, our efforts to bring in operational efficiencies yielded encouraging results during the quarter", said chief operating officer UB Pravin Rao. "We have seen positive results of some of our interventions on sales, margins and attrition, and we will continue to focus on these areas."
Infosys declared an interim dividend of Rs 30 a share, compared to Rs 20 a share in the previous year. The company also announced a bonus issue of one share for every share held, helping push the company fs stock higher by as much as 7.1%, outpacing the benchmark Nifty index on the National Stock Exchange which was down nearly 1%.
Sikka, who is regarded as the main architect of SAP 's blockbuster HANA platform for realtime analytics, said much of his strategy is work in progress. He promised details about milestones around April next year and predicted it will required 2-3 for "meaningful benefits " from the new blueprint for Infosys.
Analysts are of the view that much of the optimism about Infosys is because of " Sikka the man" referring to his credentials as a technologist, entrepreneur and high-ranking executive at one of the world 's leading software companies.
I am not very optimistic until FY17, h said an analyst at a foreign brokerage, saying it will be at least two years before Infosys can match industry growth rates. While Sikka goes all-in by committing to technologies such as artificial intelligence and automation, experts are of the view that implementation could prove to be a challenge. "The main challenge for Sikka is cultural transformation that impacts each and every business function at Infosys," said Frederic Giron, vice-president and research director at Forrester Research.
In the immediate future, the biggest worry for the company could be the continued exodus of staff, including senior management, with the attrition rate touching a record high of 20.1% at the end of September 30, compared to 19.5% at the end of June. However, Infosys said that it expects attrition to come down in the next couple of quarters to 13-15%.
Moreover, Infosys added a net of only two clients during the quarter.

All about Kailash Satyarthi, India’s Peace Nobel winner
Indian child rights activist Kailash Satyarthi shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Pakistani teenager Malala Yousufzai who stood up to the Taliban and survived a near-fatal shooting.
Yahoo India –  Fri 10 Oct, 2014

NEW DELHI: Possibly India's best known face against child labour, Kailash Satyarthi shares this year's Nobel Peace Prize with Pakistani child rights activist Malala. He and his organisation, Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) - the Save Childhood Movement, have single-handedly brought to centre-stage the debate on child rights in India.
"Child slavery is a crime against humanity. Humanity itself is at stake here. A lot of work still remains but I will see the end of child labor in my lifetime," Satyarthi told The Associated Press at his office in New Delhi. "If any child is a child slave in any part of the world, it is a blot on humanity. It is a disgrace."
The Nobel committee said: 'Satyarthi, 60, has maintained the tradition of Mahatma Gandhi and headed various forms of peaceful protests, "focusing on the grave exploitation of children for financial gain.'
Here's all that you need to know about Kailash Satyarthi:
#1 A human rights activist, Kailash Satyarthi has been at the forefront of a movement in India to end child slavery and exploitative child labour since 1980. Satyarthi has helped free children from slave-labor conditions and advocated for reforms, as director of the South Asia Coalition on Child Servitude and leader of Bachpan Bachao Andolan. In 1994, he founded a group now known as Goodweave, which certifies child-labor-free rugs and provides assistance to rescued and at-risk children.
#2 Kailash Satyarthi has headed various forms of peaceful protests and demonstrations, focusing on the exploitation of children for financial gain.
#3 In 1980, Kailash Satyarthi gave up his job as an electrical engineer to begin the crusade to end exploitation of children in India. As a grassroots activist, he rescued of over 78,500 children who were employed as child labours and developed a successful model for their education and rehabilitation.
#4 He was instrumental in making the problem of child labour in India as a human rights issue. He has established that child labor is responsible for the perpetuation of poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, population explosion and many other social evils.
#5 Satyarthi has also played an important role in linking the fight against child labor with the efforts for achieving 'Education for All'.
#6 The Nobel Laureate is a member of a high level group formed by UNESCO on Education for all comprising of select Presidents, Prime Ministers and UN Agency Heads.
#7 Kailash Satyarthi has survived numerous attacks on his life during his crusade to end child labour, the most recent being the attack on him and his colleagues while rescuing child slaves from garment sweatshops in Delhi on 17 March 2011.
#8 In 2004 while rescuing children from a local circus mafia, Kailash Satyarthi and his colleagues were brutally attacked. Despite of these attacks and his office being ransacked a number of times his commitment for the cause has been unwavering.
#9 Satyarthi has been honoured by the Former US President Bill Clinton in Washington for featuring in Kerry Kennedy's Book ‘Speak Truth to Power', where his life and work featured among the top 50 human rights defenders in the world.
#10 Wikipedia states that Satyarthi has been the subject of a number of documentaries, television series, talk shows, advocacy and awareness films.
He has also won many international awards, including:
·       2014: Nobel Peace Prize, shared with Malala Yousafzai
·       2009: Defenders of Democracy Award (US)
·       2008: Alfonso Comin International Award (Spain)
·       2007: Medal of the Italian Senate (2007)
·       2007: recognized in the list of "Heroes Acting to End Modern Day Slavery" by the US State Department[3]
·       2006: Freedom Award (US)
·       2002: Wallenberg Medal, awarded by the University of Michigan[4]
·       1999: Friedrich Ebert Stiftung Award (Germany)[5]
·       1995: Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award (US)[6]

Why Kailash Satyarthi deserves the Nobel peace prizeWhy Kailash Satyarthi deserves the Nobel Peace Prize
HT Data Team , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 10, 2014
First Published: 20:06 IST(10/10/2014) | Last Updated: 02:39 IST(11/10/2014)
Child rights activist Kailash Satyarthi, named co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, is credited with freeing tens of thousands of children working as cheap labour in homes, factories, construction and other jobs.
 
Satyarthi, 60, has been a leading activist against child labour in India, home to the largest number of working children in the world, according to the charity ChildLine, despite a 2010 law decreeing all youngsters between six and 14 must attend school.
 
Satyarthi, who trained as an electrical engineer, founded in 1980 the Bachpan Bachao Andolan or Save Childhood Movement which rescues children working in horrifying conditions. The movement has rescued 80,000 children till now across India.
The magnitude of Satyarthi's fight
 
According to census data, there were 12.6 million child labourers in 2001. In 2011, the number was 4.3 million. But according to many NGO sources there are 60 million child workers in India at present.
As per the latest data available, around 1.2 million children are working in hazardous conditions. Pan, bidi and cigarette manufacturing industries employ the largest number of child labourers, followed by construction business and domestic work.
 
The most challenging part of the struggle against child labour lies in bringing employers to justice. A large number of cases are filed against people who employ children but the conviction rate is very low.
 
Between 2011 and 2013, 35,151 cases were registered under child labor (prohibition and regulation) act, 1986. Out of which only 13,578 were prosecuted while a mere 3,077 (8% of the total cases registered) cases resulted in conviction.   
In the same time period, Delhi had the highest number of cases (18,235) registered under child labour act, followed by Andhra Pradesh (8,866) and Punjab (2,393). However, the conviction rate in Delhi and Andhra Pradesh was less than 1%, while Punjab did better with a conviction rate of 60%.
With more than 4.3 million children out there to be rescued and with the conviction rates dwindling at less than 1% in some states, Kailash Satyarthi's fight against child labour is a tough one.
*It must be noted that the conviction rates for Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are not available yet. Moreover, these are the official statistics, the actual numbers may be higher.

Making a statement in Birmingham after finishing school, she said she had spoken to Satyarthi, and had asked him also to request Modi to attend the event. She said she would similarly request Sharif for his participation.
Malala, 17, said she was honoured to be chosen for the award and for sharing it with Satyarthi, whose "great work for child rights, against child slavery inspired me". He 'totally deserved' the award, she said.
Referring to current tension between India and Pakistan on the international border, Malala expressed her disappointment and said she wanted both countries to hold dialogue and focus on education and development.
Recalling her unfortunate experience with the Taliban in the Swat valley in Pakistan, she said she earlier wanted to be study and be a doctor, but now she wanted to be a 'good politician'.
Malala was told by a teacher during her Chemistry class in school about the Nobel announcement, but went through the day as usual, attending Physics and English classes later. She thanked her parents, school teachers and fellow students for their support.
"The award is not for me but for every child in the world. This is not the end of the campaign I started, but the beginning. I want to see every child in the world go to school. I want every child to stand up for their rights, to receive quality education, not to suffer child labour, child trafficking", she said.Watch: Feel more powerful with Nobel Peace win: Malala
She added: "I had a phone call from Kailash and we both spoke about how important it is for children to go to school. We both decided to work together; also decided to try to build strong relations between both countries".
Malala is a student of the Edgbaston High School, where she enrolled after recovering from the serious head injury she suffered after being shot at by the Taliban in Pakistan. She was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where she lives with her parents.

Centres bullet-for-bullet policy lifts morale of armed forcesComments
Just hundred metres from the international border (IB), a BSF company prepares to take positions in concrete bunkers as dusk sets in. Company commander Jerin Varghese begins to brief his men. “Last night you fired very well. Keep it up. Goli ka jawab goli se dena hai (We must respond to every bullet with a bullet),” he says.

Like all company commanders in the area, Varghese is relaying orders received through the chain of command. Sometimes they are told to give a “befitting reply” and at other times, when the instructions are to hit Pakistan harder in the face of increased firing from across the border, the jawans are told, “Hilne mat dena (Don’t let them move).”
“Secure your bulletproof vests and wear your helmets at all times,” Varghese says as mortars are loaded into armoured vehicles which take the jawans to their bunkers. Two kinds of mortars are being used — 51 mm that can hit targets at 800 metres, and 81 mm that carry up to five kilometres.
Read: Pakistan taught 'befitting lesson', says Modi
Over the past week, the 192-kilometre international border has been on fire and mortars have been met with mortars. But this time the Indian intent has been redefined by New Delhi and “Hilne mat dena” includes damaging Pakistani posts and fortifications and inflicting casualties.
HT got special permission to spend a night at the border outpost. The driver accompanying this reporter preferred to move to the safety of his uncle’s home, saying, “I got married in December. I can’t take any chances.” Varghese who heard the conversation smiled, and said, “I got married in mid-September, less than a month ago.”
“How many Pakistani rangers have we killed?” is a question that has suddenly come to acquire meaning and intent. Listen carefully and it is clear that the vocabulary of BSF officers has changed.
After they received clear instructions not to seek a flag meeting and to retaliate effectively, senior officers at the BSF’s frontier headquarters often begin sentences with, “gone are the days...” “Gone are the days when we were told to hold flag meetings... Gone are the days when we were told to be restrained... Gone are the days when we were told peace will be affected...”
A BSF officer in-charge of intelligence has gathered information — through technical intelligence and intercepts — and the force believes the Pakistan Rangers have suffered up to 40 casualties.
“Gone are the days ma’am. We have hit them (Pakistan) so hard, they are not letting their media into the forward areas.”
The Narendra Modi government has drawn a new red line in its Pakistan policy: fire will be matched with fire and the BSF is gung-ho.
But there are questions that need answering: how do you de-escalate? The military response may be clear, but what is the larger strategic vision? Will a “befitting reply” silence the Pakistani guns? Isn’t last night’s calm deceptive?
It’s not for the BSF to answer these questions, the soldiers say. They’ve left them to their colleagues in the ministries of home, defence and external affairs and to officials in the Prime Minister’s office.
On ground zero, Varghese and his men know a simple truth: every day, day after day, they will have to wear their bulletproof vest and helmets and stay alert in their bunkers. The finger will stay on the trigger – in peace and in near war.

Retail brands firm up pacts to cap online pr...Allen Solly
(The 'online-versus-offline'…)
BANGALORE: There may be a lot of buzz for Amazon's Diwali Dhamaka Week and Flipkart's Big Billion Day sale, but increasing concern among brands regarding huge discounts leading to hurting their values is even more. Brands, including Crocs, Allen Solly and Nautica, are firming up agreements refraining portals from selling their stock for a price lower than their offline stores.
These companies asked all top ecommerce companies, including Amazon , Flipkart, Jabong, and Myntra , to not price below the 'landing price' or the rate at which brick-and-mortar stores purchas es goods from them.
"It's an uphill challenge for all brands to maintain pricing and brand positioning on an e-commerce platform, where the game is customer acquisition and discounting," said Nissan Joseph, general manager, Crocs India .
While online contributes to less than 10% of total sales in India, Joseph expects it to reach 30-40% in three to five years. The online-versus-offline war appears to have reached a tipping point, with malls and offline retailers asking brands to show their loyalties upfront in pricing and product range. "We have a tie-up with all e-commerce companies to not discount our new collections below a particular price," said Shivanandan Pare, head of e-commerce at Madura Fashion & Lifestyle.
Aditya Birla-led Madura Garments owns brands such as Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Allen Solly and Peter England.
"If any discounting has to take place online, we are to be notified and needs approval. Otherwise, our store sales as well as our own online store would be hurt," said Pare.
According to Assocham , during Diwali online shopping is estimated Rs 10,000 crore this year, to cross a 350% rise from last year.
Earlier this week, India's largest e-retailer Flipkart declared it created Indian e-commerce history by clocking $100 million (Rs 600 crore) sales in just 10 hours. In a bid to acquire more customers, e-commerce companies are giving dis counts up to 60% on merchandise.
However, the seller is not entirely taking the hit of the discounting. It is accounted for as "marketing costs", said a source familiar to the matter. Brands, however, realise this is hurting their positioning in the market and also, offline sales.
"E-commerce made a point to offline retailers that we have to take this channel seriously," said Tejinder Singh, COO at Arvind Internet.
"We, however, don't want to dilute our brand value and not let the ecommerce channel make our brand a commodity product." Arvind Limited owns Arrow , Lee, Wrangler, ELLE, EdHardy, and Nautica.
Online retailing, both direct and through marketplaces, is expected to touch Rs 50,000 crore by 2016, according to ratings agency Crisil.Attractive discounts are one of the biggest reasons why consumers, who have cut back on discretionary spending, continue to spend online and boost e-commerce por tals' growth. E-commerce companies understand this issue.
"We work very closely with all our brands and try to understand what their need from our channel is. If they want to sell at a particular price, we honour that and won't give discounts," said Vikas Purohit, category leader for fashion, Amazon.in.
Experts opine this cut in discounting will not hurt sales at ecommerce sites in the long term."When brand loyalty is strong, a customer will be ready to buy without any discounts," said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail and advisory firm Technopak .
"Bargain hunters and value seekers will always remain but there are customers who shop online for convenience and not just mark downs." While some retailers are looking at setting their maximum discount price contracts with ecommerce companies beforehand, others are taking a more cautious approach and not selling on all websites to maintain exclusivity.
"We keep a close watch on our online presence and only sell to Jabong and Amazon. By limiting the number of players carrying our stock, and giving web exclusive merchandise, they don't need to discount," Croc's Joseph added.
"This is how the market had to develop; we are not surprised that offline brands have become more cautious," said Praveen Sinha, MD and co-founder of online fashion retailer Jabong. "Over a period, if you keep selling below the market price, it becomes hard to sustain."

Pathak: Meet the soldier who keeps Pak in check |  Handling LoC requires insightBSF
(Pathak, in the twilight…)
NEW DELHI: Devendra Kumar Pathak did not get much sleep on the three nights he spent at the border in Jammu & Kashmir earlier this week. Besides being alongside his men inside border outposts as bullets rained across the frontier, the director-general of Border Security Force (BSF) got encouraging calls from Prime Minister Narendra Modi , exhorting him to return fire with fire.
Pathak, in the twilight of his long career in the Indian Police Service, much of which has been spent fighting terrorism and insurgency in Jammu & Kashmir and Assam, is now the man fighting Modi's 'war' with Pakistan on the international border. Although cross-border violations are nothing new, the sheer intensity has made many rate the ongoing skirmish as the worst in a decade.
And much of the action this time has been along the international border, which BSF guards, rather than the Line of Control ( LoC ) overseen by the army.
"We have decided we will give Pakistan a thrashing for their misadventure this time. We have given them a very solid pounding and the loss on the other side is very heavy," Pathak told ET on Friday. "We have fired many more times the rounds Pakistan has fired. They have been silenced."
With his tenure set to last until February 2016 in the post, Pathak is the key man for Modi as things are expected to be on edge at the border given the new, aggressive strategy of engagement.
Incidentally, Pathak was the UPA govt's choice for BSF directorgeneral this April. Top sources in the new government said there could not be a better candidate for the key job given his years of experience on both the frontiers that BSF guards — those with Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Rajnath sent Pathak to Jammu
Hailing from Bihar, he joined the IPS in 1979 at 23 in the Assam-Meghalaya cadre and held charge of four districts as senior superintendent of police (SSP) in the two states at the height of the insurgency there. At the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), he was entrusted with raising the elite, specialist anti-Naxal force CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action).
It is, however, his deep knowledge of Jammu & Kashmir that is coming in handy for the government amid the unprecedented crisis on the western front. Pathak was CRPF inspector general in Srinagar as well as CRPF special director-general of the Jammu & Kashmir zone before he shifted to BSF last year as special director and then became DG.
"I do know Pakistan and J&K well," he told ET. "That is why I feel though Pakistan has stopped firing today, you never know what will happen tomorrow. After all, they broke their earlier promise from August to not resort to unprovoked firing."
Home minister Rajnath Singh told Pathak to rush to Jammu on October 6 after firing intensified on the eve of Eid. Sources said Modi spoke to Pathak on multiple occasions while he was in Jammu, exhorting him to raise the morale of his forces and hit back with heavy retaliatory fire.
"It is rare for a PM to speak directly to the BSF chief... Usually the home minister or the home secretary remain in touch with the DG. But this time, from national security advisor Ajit Doval to the home minister and the PM, he was the direct go-to man," one of the persons said.
Pathak declined to reveal what Modi told him. "The PM and defence minister made a public statement on our response," he said. He, however, said that spending tense nights in border outposts with his men and visiting all sectors on the international border was a conscious decision. "You have to do this to show the men that their DG is alongside them. It boosts their morale," he said. On one such night, while Pathak was at an outpost in RS Pura, India fired at 65 Pakistani border outposts inside 15 minutes.

Kailash Satyarthis crusade to save childhood continues; 60 million still need himKailash Satyarthi’s crusade to save childhood continues; 60 mn still need him
KumKum Dasgupta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 10, 2014
First Published: 14:50 IST(10/10/2014) | Last Updated: 11:49 IST(11/10/2014)
Before he became the second Indian to win the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, not many had heard Kailash Satyarthi’s name.
 
But within 90 minutes of the announcement, the child's rights activist had gained more than 4,500 followers on Twitter--and the list was growing at blazing speed.
 
The 60-year-old activist has been a relentless crusader of child rights and his organisation, the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), has been at the forefront of the drive against child labour in India for years.
Interview: 'The award will benefit the movement'
 
“It was a passion from my childhood to work for children, I carried it forward," said Satyarthi. “I have been very strongly advocating that poverty must not be used as an excuse to continue child labour. It perpetuates poverty. If children are deprived of education, they remain poor.”

Satyarthi was trained as an electrical engineer, but he began his work by staging raids on Indian manufacturing, rug-making and other plants where children and their parents often work as bonded labour.
Read:  The highest honour: India’s Nobel Prize connection
 
The Bachpan Bachao Andolan, founded in 1980, has fought child labour by creating domestic and international consumer resistance to products made by bonded children, as well as with direct legal and advocacy work.
 
Building on his initial activism, Satyarthi organised the Global March Against Child Labor in the 1990s -- dedicated to freeing the millions of children abused worldwide in a form of modern slavery.
 
The activist is also founder of RugMark, a widely known international scheme that tags all carpets made in factories that are child-labour free.
Read: Why Kailash Satyarthi deserves the Nobel Peace Prize
 
In 1998, he organised the Global March Against Child Labour across 103 countries, which helped pave the way for an International Labor Organization convention on the worst forms of child labour.
 
He described the plight of children forced into the worst kinds of abusive work in a 2010 interview with the Robert F. Kennedy Centre for Justice and Human Rights.
 
"If they cry for their parents, they are beaten severely, sometimes hanged upside down from trees and even branded or burned with cigarettes," he said.
 
Satyarthi has said his social conscience was awoken when he was six and noticed a boy his age on the steps outside the school with his father, cleaning shoes.
Watch: 'Why I took up the cause of child rights'
Seeing many such children working instead of being educated, he felt an urge as he grew older to solve the problem -- launching him on his career of activism.
 
"I think of it all as a test. This is a moral examination that one has to pass. ... to stand up against such social evils," he said in the Kennedy Centre interview.
 
Through a number of training programmes, Satyarthi also helps children sold to pay off their parents' debts find new lives and serve as agents of prevention within their communities.
 
“The outstanding work that Mr Satyarthi has done over the past 35 years on child labour and trafficking has helped change mindsets and influence communities to protect children’s rights and create a more just society,” Deval Sanghavi, founder of Mumbai-based philanthropic organisation Dasra, told HT.
President Barack Obama on Friday congratulated Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai calling their Nobel “a victory for all who strive to uphold the dignity of every human being”.
Himself a Nobel peace laureate from 2009, Obama also said that despite their difference background, they share an “unshakeable belief in the basic dignity of every girl and boy”.
Read: Satyarthi’s hometown erupts in joy
 
The Bachpan Bachao Andolan was initiated as a grassroot-level and direct-action-oriented people's movement in 1980 to eliminate exploitation of children, especially child labour and child trafficking. The campaign has over 80,000 individuals and 750 organisations as members, who advocate and act for the protection of child rights.
 
One of Satyarthi’s big achievements is the promotion of a consumer awareness campaign in Europe and the US aimed at dissuading consumers from buying carpets made by child labourers and simultaneously endorsing goods produced without exploiting children.
 
Satyarthi uses an array of techniques including lobbying with politicians and knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court, National Human Rights Commission and other judicial institutions for enforcement of child rights laws.

Modi govt fooling people by saying  jaldi thik ho jayega : RahulModi govt fooling people, says Rahul Gandhi
PTI  Saswad, Pune, October 10, 2014
First Published: 22:00 IST(10/10/2014) | Last Updated: 12:11 IST(11/10/2014)
Comments
Taking potshots at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Friday said that after promising "achhe din" (good times), he was now fobbing off the people with the assurance that "jaldi thik ho jayega" (things will be alright soon) along the border with Pakistan.
Addressing a campaign rally for Maharashtra assembly polls at Saswad in Pune district, Rahul said that during the Lok Sabha election campaign Modi used to say that he would scare off Pakistan and China. "Last few days have seen ceasefire violations by Pakistan, which had not happened in the last ten years. There are casualties but still Modi says 'jaldi thik ho jayega'," he said.
"Earlier achhe din (good times) were promised. Now people laugh at this slogan," he said.
Don’t expect maturity, wisdom from Rahul: BJP
The Prime Minister had said 'things will be alright soon' at a function recently when a reporter asked him about ceasefire violations by the Pakistani army.
When Modi was sitting on a swing-set with the Chinese president Xi Jingping in Ahmedabad, troops from that country entered the Indian territory, the Congress vice president added.
"But the Prime Minister discussed only investment with China and did not demand that incursions be stopped because what is important for him is his image," Rahul said.
Rubbishing 'the Gujarat model' of development, Rahul said Maharashtra was ahead in every sphere. "Yesterday I was in Haryana which is the leading state in terms of per capita income. Maharashtra is second," he said.
"Our political rivals say nothing has happened in the country in the last 60 years. They come to you in cars manufactured in Pune and speak to you on mobile phones, yet they say nothing has happened. The United States is in awe of our manufacturing and information technology sector and still someone says nothing has happened. Only he is going to fix it all," Rahul said.
The Congress vice president also lauded the way the Congress-led Maharashtra government had dealt with the drought in the state over the last few years.
Earlier, speaking at Wani in Nashik district, Rahul responded to Modi's call for "Congress-free Maharashtra" by saying that Congress can never be banished from the state.
"There is no difference between the ideology of Congress and the thoughts of Shivaji Maharaj, Babasaheb Ambedkar and Jyotiba Phule. How will you remove them from the lives of people?" he said.
He accused the NDA government of working for the benefit of industrialists at the expense of the poor. "We started direct benefit transfer scheme for the poor under which money for social sector schemes like MNREGA was transferred to your bank accounts. Today, they too are continuing with it, but with a difference.
"Before Modi went to the US, a delegation of industrialists from there met him and pleaded for removal of the cap on prices of medicines. A deal was reached behind the doors and now drugs for treating cancer that cost Rs. 8,000 earlier will be available for Rs. one lakh," Rahul alleged.
Similarly, prices of medicines for diabetes, blood pressure and cancer will increase manifold now, he warned.
Rahul also reminded the audience that Congress-led UPA government had amended the land acquisition law for the benefit of the poor and adivasis.

Cinema  Kamals fulcrumUpdated: October 9, 2014 21:31 IST
Cinema, Kamal’s fulcrum
Special arrangement Kamal Haasan in Sagara Sangamam.
TOPICS
Part 7: Three teachers, one student!
The same year, 1978, Kamal Haasan was seen in a more famous dance sequence in the ‘Ennadi Meenatchi’ number in ‘Ilamai Oonjaladugiradhu’. Looking like a scrawny Elvis in an all-white outfit bisected by a belt buckle the size of an infant’s head, he was a wiry stage presence, flailing his arms and kicking the air. That was after he picked up a bit of karate under a teacher named Kuppuswamy.
Kamal said, “When I was 16, I felt I might be left with some effeminacy because of all the dancing. I was so full of classical dance that I wanted to get away and do something else.” His friend Shekhar was a karate champ, working with Kuppuswamy. Just like Kamal was learning dance in his house, Shekhar was learning karate in his – on the terrace. “We’d practise karate for six-seven hours every day, and that changed my dancing style too. The stance of karate came into my dance. If you watch ‘Ennadi Meenatchi’, you can make out that I have leant karate as well as dance.” Meanwhile, Anglo-Indian friends in Egmore taught him the fox trot.
***
This is why Kamal Haasan likes to say, despite what viewers of ‘Sagara Sangamam’/’Salangai Oli’ may think, that he is not trained in the traditional classical format. He said, “I’m like a vaudeville artist rather than a Kalakshetra or a Trinity College kind of person. At first, I was diffident about the kind of groups I interacted with, because it was not the way my sister trained. It was not ‘pure.’ But my experience was very rich and later on, I found that what I did was not something to be ashamed of.”
I asked him what drove him to all these different forms of dance. He said he was looking for something, a more versatile medium, and he found it in cinema. “I had all this creativity, but I was looking for a way to express it, and cinema became the fulcrum with which I could lift all this weight. When classical singers or dancers look at cinema with derision, I have half a heart to tell them that they’re wrong. They’re losing a platform.”
He spoke some more about ‘Sagara Sangamam’. He recalled the response of dance teachers who told him that this film had done to dance what they had done through their lives. “It was very touching,” he said. “But that has more to do with the medium. You should also give credit to Vyjayanthimala and Kumari Kamala. In their time, dance was seen as a feminine domain. I brought it to the masculine domain. Unfortunately, I was the only ambassador at the time.” I asked him why films have stopped showcasing the classical arts. He said, “I think it’s simply an attitude, because it has to be sponsored. The sponsors – be it a king or a producer or the Britannia biscuit company – are either not interested or ill-informed. They all focus on their product. They have no social or aesthetic commitment.”
He spoke a lot about Thangappan Master. “I’ve never seen someone so large-hearted. Even when he was choreographing, he’d give the camera to (RC) Sakthi and me and say, ‘We’re running out of time, we’re waiting for artists, I have to be here, you guys take the camera, go shoot the rest of the song and bring it back.’ It was all very touching and very exhilarating for us.”
I asked him if he remembered the first song he choreographed. He spoke about choreographing a song for Akinneani Nageswara Rao in ‘Sreemanthudu’, which was released in 1971. “I met him on his 90th birthday. He remembered me as his dance assistant. We were both rationalists. He saw me not bowing to the arati. He asked me, ‘Are you a Muslim?’ I said no. He said, ‘Then why are you not praying?’ I said I don’t believe in it. I’m an atheist. He said, ‘Well, you’ve got a friend in me’.”
Kamal Haasan also spoke about the comedian Raj Babu, whom he called the counterpart of Nagesh in Telugu. “He was very fond of me. He said you’re wasting time here. You’re going to become an actor. I have composed songs for him too. But I don’t really remember the first song.”

IMPORTANT: Always ask for the land share before buying a flatView Gallery
10 Fantasy Homes You Have to See to Believe
Buying a real estate or a new property requires a holistic approach. From choosing the right location to the right size of the property and the right developer, there are a lot of factors that a buyer needs to address to get the perfect property.Many buyers often decide on their purchase based on built up area offered and the additional amenities attached to the flat. And the most important factor in any real estate purchase namely the actual land ownership is often overlooked. For every purchase in real estate projects, the buyer has some value of land allocated in his or her name known as the undivided land share. Let us take a look at this important aspect of undivided land share, its significance and legal importance.
Understanding Undivided Share of Land (UDS):  When you are buying an apartment, you are technically buying two things. The first is the constructed part of the building where the owners will actually reside while the second is a proportionate share of the land where the property is built. This share of land allotted to the flat buyer is known as undivided land share or UDS. Many buyers are unaware of such an important aspect of land deal while purchasing property.
Significance of UDS:  The building is essentially a dead asset in real estate, as the value of constructed area depreciates. The older the construction, the lower is its market value of the property. On the other hand the prices of land keep escalating over time and may offer substantial return on investment for the landowner. This appreciation in the overall value of any property is due to the increase in the land rate and not the constructed area. Essentially it is the undivided land share in accordance with the built up area of the apartment that determines the future monetary value of the property. In case the land owner has no undivided land share, he or she may not be able to sell the property leave alone enjoy a good return on investment.
Legal Implications of UDS: The legal implication of undivided land share makes it an intrinsic part of any real estate deal. Suppose the building where you reside is to be demolished for reconstruction ten years down the line or comes under government acquisition project and made available for demolition, the compensation administered to the flat owner depends on the percentage of the undivided land share in the property. The sum of all the undivided shares for each apartment owner must proportionate to the area of the land in which the apartments are constructed. In case of co-operative housing societies, the UDS must be legally be in the name of the society as the flat owners are the share holders of the society.
UDS Calculation: UDS calculation is determined by a simple formula by multiplying the total land area with the size of the individual apartment and dividing the result by sum of areas of all apartments combined in the project.
Illustration for UDS Calculation: For example let us suppose 5 equally sized apartments of 1000 sq ft are built on one ground of land which measures 3500 sq ft. The UDS would be calculated as multiplying the total land area with the size of the individual apartment (3500*1000) in this case and dividing the result by sum of areas of all apartments combined in the project which is 1000*5= 5000.
Hence UDS = 1000*3500/5000 = 700 square feet.
UDS and Ownership of Parking Space:  Some real estate builders and developers have been guilty in the past of selling open or stilt car parking area to the individual house owners. As per the legal laws biding for each real estate deal and UDS, any purchasers cannot claim partition of their UDS of land. An open car parking therefore can only be sold as part of common area and cannot be legally included as part of the floor area of individuals.
Checking Validity of UDS while Purchase Property: While paying advance for any property, make sure the builder or the seller shares with you the agreement copy. The agreement copy between the builder and the seller holds all important details of the property in question including the details of the undivided share of land. There is usually a dedicated section in the builder agreement catering to the UDS share which is mostly mentioned in either percentage terms for example 0.75% or in exact square feet terms. Make sure your builder agreement clearly mentions the undivided share of land and this same figure is mentioned in the title deed also when the registration gets over, to safeguard your purchase and to avoid any legal complication in the future.

Prime Minister Modi launched scheme to develop villages today
TOPICS

The scheme encourages MPs from both Houses to identify and develop one village from their constituencies
Taking forward his announcement during his address to the nation on August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday unveiled a blueprint for the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) on Jayaprakash Narayan’s birth anniversary.
The scheme encourages Members of Parliament from both Houses to identify and develop one village from their constituency as a model village by 2016, and two more by 2019, covering over 2,500 villages of the 6 lakh villages country-wide.
“This is not a rupiya-paisa yojana but a demand-driven, people’s participatory scheme. There are 800 parliamentarians and in three years, 2,500-odd villages could get covered. If States were to initiate their own similar schemes with MLAs, 6,000 to 7,000 villages could get covered. One good village can affect an entire area, and a viral effect could begin,” Mr. Modi said while unveiling SAGY for which no new funds have been allocated.
MPLAD funds to benefit model villages
The 65-page outline for the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday here, in the presence of Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari, requires MPs to identify one village with a population of 3,000-5,000 in the plains and 1,000-3,000 in the hills within a month for convergence of existing schemes for socio-economic development of the area.
MPs can choose any village except their own or their spouse’s. There is no other criterion.
MPs are expected to facilitate a village development plan, motivate villagers to take up activities and use the Rs.5-crore MPLAD fund to fill gaps for funds besides mobilising “additional resources especially from Corporate Social Responsibility” in sewage and water supply schemes.
The activities and outcomes will cover broad development indicators such as health, nutrition and education through organising immunization drives, improving mid-day meal schemes, improving Aadhaar enrolment, setting up “smart schools” with IT-enabled classrooms and e-libraries, improving panchayat infrastructure under schemes such as MNREGA and Backward Regions Grants Fund.
A series of measures speak of better implementation of existing and new schemes and laws including RTI Act, National Food Security Act, National Rural Livelihood Mission, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, while at the same time emphasising “activities to improve hygienic behaviour” by encouraging bathing among villagers, use of toilets and exercising for thirty minutes every day. It envisions social development in villages through identifying a village day, a village song, and focusing on alternative methods of dispute resolution.
There will be real-time web-based monitoring and a first review after five months by an independent agency. District Collectors will carry out a baseline surveys and then chair monthly review meetings to monitor progress. At the State-level, Chief Secretaries will lead an empowered committee on the same and the Minister for Rural Development and Secretary, Rural Development, will chair two national-level committees to track the scheme.
“This is not a small risk that I have taken by suggesting this. Instead of maximising the use of MPLAD funds over the largest possible area, this will instead require focusing the funds in a village. MPs will be able to identify the shortcomings in implementation of schemes,” said Mr. Modi.
Speaking at the event, Mr. Gadkari said: “SAGY aims at socio-economic transformation, not just making government funds and facilities available to villages. This will be a movement from swaraj to suraaj.” The aim would be to inculcate a sense of pride, volunteerism, and self-reliance in villages, he added.

Facebooks CEO Zuckerberg to meet PM Modi todayFacebook’s CEO Zuckerberg to meet PM Modi today
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 09, 2014

Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg started an India visit on Thursday with an aim to link India’s pressing needs for development with his own ambitious plan to lift up hundreds of millions of people above the digital poverty line – and in the process build a huge market for his social network that made him a billionaire when he was only 23.
“People do need food, clothing, health and toilets,” the 30-year-old told a news conference. “Internet is an enabler of all these things. Nobody is going to say the internet is more important than food or clean water.”
Read: Internet for all, Zuckerberg’s India mantra
Zuckerberg, due to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, was asked about the leader’s Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan (Clean India Movement) and his meeting. “I am interested in learning how we can help. I am going to be listening,” he said of the meeting, saying the common interest was in Modi’s “Digital India” initiative.
He focused largely on his pet plan to bridge the digital divide, and said free “basic internet services” that demonstrate the utility of the information network would help millions discover the internet because they do not know how it would benefit them.
Facebook’s plan is to engage with telecom operators in countries such as the Philippines, Tanzania and Paraguay to test free Internet-based information services and then bring them to India. It is important to make such ventures profitable for telecom service providers, Zuckerberg said.
Asked about concerns on privacy in which Facebook is often used of intruding into the affairs of its users through its technology driven market research, Zuckerberg said his company believed in making products that are tweaked and modified on the basis of feedback from users.
“We have empathy for all cultures,” he said.

West Bengal is India's new terror haven
West Bengal’s porous 2,200-km border with Bangladesh makes it a convenient passage point into India for militants associated with several organisations.
Mail Today –  Fri 10 Oct, 2014
Print
(Image courtesy: India Today)KOLKATA: When the smoke from last week’s blast in Burdwan cleared, it left in its wake a deeply distressing picture that puts West Bengal smack at the centre of an blood-lust-driven international network.
Just five years ago, Indian Mujahideen (IM) co-founder Yasin Bhatkal was briefly apprehended in Kolkata (he managed to get away at the time, thanks in equal measure to an assumed identity and lack of coordination among state and central security agencies).
The ammonium nitrate for the IEDs that killed 21 people in Varanasi in 2006 was bought from the Burrabazar wholesale market at Kolkata. It is also suspected that the raw material for explosives that tore through Pune’s German Bakery in 2010 was given to Bhatkal in Kolkata by an IM operative native to the border district of Nadia.
Homegrown terror
One of the accused in the explosion which killed 17 people, IM operative of Bangladeshi origin Zahid Hussein, was arrested in Kolkata this July. One of the homegrown terror group’s big players, Amir Reza Khan, an accused in the 2002 American Center attack, is a former Kolkata resident.
West Bengal’s porous 2,200-km border with Bangladesh makes it a convenient passage point into India for militants associated with several organisations. In this light, it comes as no surprise that the state’s name has surfaced repeatedly in terror investigations over the years.
Not just this, it has also emerged as a major channel for the smuggling of fake Indian currency notes (FICN).
In fact, Bhatkal was arrested in 2009 by the Kolkata Police Special Task Force for carrying FICN, while intelligence sources said Zahid Hussein was involved in an FICN racket that helped fund “subversive” activities.
“Since the state shares a vast part of its international border with Bangladesh, it is easy for illegal migrants to use it as a safe transit corridor,” a senior security official said.
“The advantages they enjoy here are innumerable: immigrant-pockets which have proved to be excellent hideouts; a big metropolitan, Kolkata offers them concealment and its railway stations, namely Howrah and Sealdah, easy connectivity with the rest of the country,” the official added.
The two militants killed in the October 2 Burdwan explosion and their acquaintances are said to be associated with the Bangladesh-based terror group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). One of the militants killed, Shakeel Ahmed, hailed from Bangladesh.
Intelligence sources said many militants often come to Burdwan — a location of great strategic importance given its proximity to both Bangladesh as well as the North-east — to lay low and prepare for assignments. More worryingly, the arrests brought back top JMB operative Maulana Saidur’s confession from last year that the group had established a network in three districts of West Bengal.
Security officials stress that the state government needs to urgently implement a proper review mechanism along the border and inspect residents in the area carefully before equipping them with photo identity cards.
“The state government must develop a joint mechanism to review and interrogate people in a proper way before giving them identity cards. We have found that a number of Bangladeshi immigrants have Indian voter ID cards, which makes it difficult for the Indian security agencies to filter them out,” a senior BSF official posted at the South Bengal Frontier said.
Network
The Burdwan explosion has led to accusations from the Opposition that West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee government is responsible for the state’s strengthening image as a haven for terrorists.
With the Centre handing over the probe to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the actual extent of the terror network may finally be discovered.

Bill Gates building machine to diagnose diseases quicklyBill Gates Is Building A Machine To Diagnose Nasty Diseases
By Julie Bort | Business Insider –  Fri 10 Oct, 2014 5:22 AM IST

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is celebrating 10 years of its Grand Challenges in Global Health  program, where it asks scientists to brainstorm solutions to gnarly health problems and then offers grants to the best ideas.
Through his foundation, Gates has ventured into areas that others would shun, such as new kinds of toilets, batteries that run on human urine , more-enjoyable condoms that offer better protection against sexually transmitted disease.
On Thursday, he gave an update on a new challenge: "Can you create a new device that quickly diagnoses HIV, TB, malaria, and other diseases… accepts different samples, like blood, saliva, and sputum… is affordable… and reliable… and will work in a small clinic that has only a few hours of electricity a day?" he wrote in a blog post.
Sounds like something akin to a "Star Trek" tricorder, the handheld device from the sci-fi TV show that analyzed the world.  But there's already a $10 million X Prize challenge  for that sponsored by Qualcomm. (That grand prize will be awarded in 2016.)
Gates shared a picture of the kind of device his scientists are working on, and it looks kind of like a 3D printer. You slip the samples into it and out pops an diagnosis on a screen.
There are five teams working on the challenge, he says. This device pictured below is from a Seattle-based health R&D company called Stratos.
Stratos via Bill Gates blog Gatesnotes Stratos diagnosis machine prototype
"Today we know that it’s technically possible to build a device and that there are partners ready to help," he says.
But he knows that's not enough. There are questions such as if these machines can be made affordably enough and if it will do any good to diagnose people in areas where medical treatment is scarce.
But it is Gates' attitude toward the challenge that is also inspiring.
"If this idea succeeds, that will be fantastic. If it doesn’t, we’ll all be disappointed," he writes. "If one avenue turns out to be a dead end, there are always many more waiting to be explored."
That's just plain good advice for anyone trying to do anything hard in life.

Top finance officials from G20 grapple with weak growth and infrastructure
AP Oct 11, 2014, 09.49AM IST

Federal Reserve
(Finance officials from…)
WASHINGTON: Finance ministers from the world's largest economies said that they are determined to prevent a slide into another global recession, but a top US official expressed frustration that a number of major economies were not doing enough to increase growth.
After two days of discussions, finance officials from the Group of 20 nations unveiled plans for a global initiative to build roads and other infrastructure projects to help boost world growth by $2 trillion over the next five years and create millions of jobs.
But officials conceded that this longer-run effort will not help with the pressing problems of weak growth in Europe and a number of other parts of the world. And US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said governments in Europe, Japan and China were failing to deliver needed support.
"European leaders should focus on recalibrating policies to address persistent demand weaknesses," Lew said in comments prepared for a session of the policy-setting committee of the International Monetary Fund.
Weak reports on industrial production and trade out of Germany, Europe's largest economy, jolted financial markets and raised worries that Europe could be headed for another recession. US stocks endured their worst week since May 2012, with the losses continuing on Friday when the Dow Jones industrial average slid 115 points.
It was against this backdrop that G-20 finance ministers and central bank presidents met for talks that ended Friday in advance of the annual meetings of the 188-nation IMF and its sister lending institution, the World Bank.
Lew did not mention Germany by name, but it was clear that his remarks on Europe focused on that nation's reluctance to do more to stimulate growth. He said that "countries with external surpluses and fiscal flexibility" needed to increase their efforts to promote stronger growth. Germany ran a large trade surplus last year.
Lew said economic risks in China had risen and that country had ample resources to adjust its policies to support domestic-led growth. He described Japan's prospects as uncertain, "with growth projected to remain weak this year and next," and said Japanese officials needed to move "decisively" to implement needed structural reforms in its economy.
Speaking at a news conference, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said his economy, the world's third largest, was not weakening even though growth had slowed in the April-June quarter. "We are still on the track to recovery" and the nation was starting to emerge from its prolonged period of deflation, he said.
The G-20 group is led this year by Australia, which will host a leader's summit next month in Brisbane. Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey, who chaired the finance discussions, told reporters that the plan the G-20 group has developed involved more than 900 individual projects with the potential to lift growth by 1.8 percent over the next five years. He said all the details would be revealed at the leaders' summit.
While developing the five-year plan for infrastructure projects, the G-20 finance officials were less successful in their efforts to deal with the immediate threats from the slowdowns in Europe, Latin America and China. The group did not issue a communique, but individual finance ministers said the economic problems were discussed in the sessions.
"We as a group do not want to settle for mediocre growth," Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver told reporters after the G-20 discussions ended Friday. "We don't think we have to."
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that while the problems facing the global economy were well known, "action in the past has lacked. This time, the challenge is for real. We must aim higher, try harder and work better together to achieve higher growth outcomes."
The finance officials also addressed a growing health crisis in the Ebola virus outbreak.
In his remarks to the finance officials, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, an infectious diseases and public health expert, called for the creation of a new pandemic emergency facility that would rapidly respond to future health emergencies by delivering money to countries in crisis.
"Even as we focus intensely on the emergency response (to Ebola), we must also plan for the next epidemic, which could spread more quickly, kill even more people and potentially devastate the global economy," Kim said.
Both the policy-setting committees of the bank and the IMF were expected to address the Ebola crisis at their meetings on Saturday.
Officials also addressed their ongoing efforts to strengthen financial regulation to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, the worst disruption of the banking system since the 1930s.
Treasury officials said that on Monday, Lew and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen would join British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney in a joint exercise to determine how banking authorities in both countries would handle the failure of a large multinational bank.

Cyclone Hudhud: Centre reviews preparedness with AP  Odishacyclones
The Andhra Pradesh government is gearing up to brace for the severe cyclonic storm ‘Hudhud’ which lay centred at about 500 km of Visakhapatnam and 550 km of Gopalpur in Odisha, and expected to cross the coast near Visakhapatnam by forenoon of October 12.
Given the IMD warning that the system will intensify further into a very severe cyclonic storm during next 12 hours and with wind speeds reaching up to 150 km, the Centre started monitoring the situation in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha closely.
At a video conference with the Chief Secretaries of both the States and officers of the Army, the Navy and the Air force on Friday afternoon, the Union Cabinet Secretary enquired about the preparedness of the States and their requirements for relief operations.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary I. Y. R. Krishna Rao also uplinked the Collectors of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari.
While 38 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams were being deputed to the two States, 20 teams reached Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, another three stand-by teams will reach Guntur by Saturday morning. With the experience of the Phailin cyclonic storm last year, the four district Collectors said all precautionary steps were being taken.
Air Force plea
The Air Force officials said that standby arrangements were made and eight helicopters -- four medium and four small -- would be deployed for evacuation and relief operations as severe flooding would follow after the landfall. The requested the Chief Secretary to give instructions to the district authorities to keep adequate stocks of aviation fuel, about 20,000 litres in the airfields at Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Rajahmundry and Begumpet.
They also requested one contact person be posted at these airports for coordination and swift transport of properly reinforced small pockets of food, water and medicines as part of relief to people in the affected areas.
On a suggestion from the Srikakulam Collector, the Chief Secretary said they would establish contact with the Odisha Irrigation Secretary for prior information about release of flood water to the Nagavali and Vamsadhara rivers so that people could be evacuated.
Later, Chief Secretary I. Y. R. Krishna Rao told media persons that with the Union Cabinet Secretary monitoring the situation on a daily basis since Thursday, coordination with the Service officers became easier. The Army would also move in shortly, he added. As things stand now, the cyclone is likely to cross the coast between Visakhapantam and Anakapalle.
Depending on the situation, the Collectors were asked to use their discretion to reschedule Janmabhoomi in the districts.

After Jaya conviction  TN opposition senses chance to strengthen ranksJaya conviction, TN oppn set to strengthen ranks
PTI  Chennai, October 11, 2014
First Published: 11:16 IST(11/10/2014) | Last Updated: 13:18 IST(11/10/2014)
Comments
With a vacuum created in Tamil Nadu's political scene following the conviction of AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa in a graft case, opposition parties are smelling an opportunity to strengthen their ranks ahead of the 2016 Assembly polls.
At the forefront is the DMK, whose house the party chief M Karunanidhi is trying to put in order in the wake of intra-party squabbles following the 2011 electoral debacle.
The party has gone through its share of churnings since then, including expulsion of Karunanidhi's Madurai-based son M K Alagiri from the party following his open outbursts on leadership issues.
Having self-appraised its rout at the 2011 hustings-- not even managing to secure the main opposition party status, the DMK sees a glimmer of hope to shore up its prospects with Jayalalithaa's conviction.
Having spearheaded the disproportionate assets case against Jayalalithaa, with party senior K Anbazhagan impleading in the case, Karunanidhi believes the conviction of his bete noire has infused fresh energy in DMK.
"At a time when she was trying to finish off this movement (DMK), when all our comrades were tensed (about it), she herself walked into the trap, and it is a fact that she unwittingly helped in giving a push to this movement," he said.
Karunanidhi's remarks came at a recent meeting of his party's district secretaries, where he described Jayalalithaa's incarceration as her own doing.
He said Jayalalithaa may go for an appeal in the Supreme Court against her conviction, but her aspirations of coming back to power will remain a 'dream.'
However, the party is still in a Catch-22 situation as the 2G spectrum case, in which Karunanidhi's daughter Kanimozhi and junior colleague A Raja are accused, hangs like the proverbial Damocles sword.
DMK chief's wife Dayalu Ammal is a witness in the CBI-probed case. It is believed that this fact made Karunanidhi tread a cautious path over the Jayalalithaa verdict, as he remained incommunicado over the entire day on September 27 even as his reaction to Jayalalithaa's conviction, eagerly awaited by political observers, came late.
While AIADMK is perceived to be on friendly terms with BJP at the national level, with Jayalalithaa sharing cordial ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leaders sing a different tune in Tamil Nadu.
The BJP's state unit, which put up a straight fight against the ruling party in the recently held bypolls to some local bodies, including Corporations, seems to be planning for 2016 after it tasted some victory in the April Lok Sabha polls though Jayalalithaa's party netted 37 of the 39 seats in Chennai. The civic bypolls were reduced to a BJP-AIADMK fight and ever since Jayalalithaa's conviction, the saffron party is complaining of law and order situation day in and day out. Interestingly, BJP is reportedly wooing actor Rajnikanth, apparently aiming to cash in on his star power to ensure a better performance in the next elections.
The actor had earlier supported former Prime Minister A B Vajapayee's river inter-linking efforts. Neither the actor nor BJP have denied reports of the latter's national president Amit Shah holding telephonic conversations with the star recently. The party has been facing a severe drought in the state Assembly, having been unable to return a legislator for over a decade. AIADMK's anticipation of smooth sailing in the 2016 elections seem to be a tough task with its chief in jail and the party virtually directionless.
This has led to speculation of a realignment of political equations, with MDMK leader Vaiko, a strong critic of Karunanidhi, softening his stand against the DMK leader. A former DMK leader, who quit the party after he fell out of favour with Karunanidhi, Vaiko in his party's recent conference did not attack the 90-year-old leader even as he welcomed DMK's stand on a referendum on Eelam Tamils issue, seen as feelers by political observers.
While the 2016 polls is still 18 months away, managers in political parties have started their calculations, aiming to stop the AIADMK juggernaut that had been steamrolling them since 2011. The M G Ramachandran-founded party has not lost a single election since the 2011 polls even as supporters and workers are keeping their fingers crossed over 'Amma' returning to the thick of action and steer the party from the perceived blot it had suffered on September 27 when she was convicted in the disproportionate assets case.

Hudhud nears AP coast  200 000 people to be ...Cyclone storm Hudhud nears Andhra Pradesh coast, 200,000 people to be evacuated
By IANS | 10 Oct, 2014, 11.34PM IST
According to IMD, the cyclone is lying 330 km southeast of Visakhapatnam and 380 km south-southeast of Gopalpur on Saturday morning.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
VISAKHAPATNAM: With cyclonic storm Hudhud set to hit the Andhra coast Sunday, the authorities are preparing to evacuate more than 200,000 people in four coastal districts to safer places.
The northern coastal districts of Srikakulam, Vijayanagaram and Visakhapatnam and adjoining coastal district of East Godavari are bracing for the 'very severe' cyclonic storm, which is likely to make a landfall around Visakhapatnam Sunday forenoon.
According to Indian Meterological Department (IMD), the cyclone is lying 330 km southeast of Visakhapatnam and 380 km south-southeast of Gopalpur on Saturday morning.
Fifteen teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and 250 personnel of army have reached the region while four naval ships and 10 helicopters of Indian Navy and Indian Air Force (IAF) are ready for rescue and relief operations.
The evacuation of people from coastal and low-lying areas will start later in the day. Officials said the number of people to be evacuated would depend on the weather conditions.
Winds along the coast are gathering momentum while sea conditions have turned rough. Visakhapatnam Cyclone Warning Centre has forecast rains from Saturday afternoon.
It has warned of rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy falls at a few places and isolated extremely heavy falls over West Godavari, East Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vijayanagaram and Srikakulam districts of north Andhra Pradesh and eight districts of south Odisha during next two days.
Squally wind speed reaching 50-60 kmph would prevail along and off north Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha coasts during next 12 hrs. The wind speed would gradually increase to 140-150 kmph around the time of landfall along and off north Andhra Pradesh.
The IMD has also issued storm surge warning. Storm surge would inundate low lying areas of north coastal Andhra.
Extensive damage to kutcha houses, uprooting of big trees, partial disruption of power and communication lines are expected.
Fishing operations have been suspended along the coast as authorities have warned fishermen against venturing into sea.
As there is no possibility of cyclone changing its course or its weakening, , Chief Secretary I.Y.R. Krishna Rao directed officials to be ready for cyclone relief measures on war-footing.
He said BSNL and other telecom service providers were urged to issue cyclone alerts to people living in coastal areas.
Round the clock control rooms have been opened at Andhra Pradesh secretariat in Hyderabad. The numbers are 040- 23456005 and 23450419.
Coast Guard, Coastal Security wing, Marine Police, and also superintendents of police were asked to be alert in view of cyclone and assist the District administration.
The authorities have set up over 200 relief camps to provide shelter to people to be evacuated from vulnerable villages. The government has cancelled leave of all employees and those who were on leave were asked to immediately return to the duties.
The district collectors said they have made arrangements to stock fuel, drinking water, food, medicines and other essential commodities for rescue and relief operations.
As a precautionary measure, the railways have cancelled over 60 trains and diverted many others in view of the cyclone.

Work on 30 Meter Telescope with Indian suppo...Construction on 30 Meter Telescope with Indian support begins
By PTI | 10 Oct, 2014, 11.41PM IST
The gigantic telescope, scheduled to be ready by 2020, will provide astronomers with unparalleled power to observe the intricacies of the universe.
ET SPECIAL:

WASHINGTON: The construction of ambitious next-generation Thirty Meter Telescope, to be built at an estimated cost of $ 1.47 billion by an international consortium consisting of institutions from India, the US, Canada , Japan and China, has begun this week in Hawaii.
The gigantic telescope, scheduled to be ready by 2020, will provide astronomers with unparalleled power to observe the intricacies of the universe from the comfort of Earth.
India is a significant partner in this ambitious international project, which would enable scientists to answer some of the most fundamental questions in modern science.
Last month, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given its approval for India's participation in the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) Project at Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA at a total cost of Rs 1299.8 crores from 2014-23.
The project is an international consortium consisting of institutions from the USA, Canada, Japan, India and China.
From India side, this will be a joint project of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).
With its contributions, India will be a 10 per cent partner in the project and 70 per cent of its contributions will be "in kind". This will translate into 25 to 30 observing nights on the telescope for Indian scientists per year.
The TMT will enable scientists to study fainter objects far away from us in the Universe, which will give information about early stages of the evolution of the Universe.
It will also give finer details of not-so-far-away objects such as undiscovered planets and other objects in the Solar System and planets around other stars.
This partnership will also enhance India's technological capabilities in high-technology areas such as primary mirror segment figuring and polishing, mirror support system and edge sensor assembly and testing, software for observatory controls, data analysis pipelines, adaptive optics techniques.
The TMT will be one of the largest optical-infrared telescopes to come up in the next decade. Its 30 meter diameter primary mirror will consist of 492 segments of 1.44 meter diameter each.
These mirror segments will be cleverly positioned relative to each other through sophisticated sensors, actuators and control systems, so that the entire assembly behaves like a single monolithic mirror.
From the Indian side, the project would be led by Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) Bangalore, with the help of Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital and Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune.

PM Modi launches Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana; exhorts parliamentarians to adopt a village eachPM Modi exhorts MPs to adopt a village each
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Ne Delhi, October 11, 2014

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched a rural development scheme under which each member of parliament will adopt three villages by 2019 to improve the standard of living and quality of life of millions of people in the countryside.
The government hopes the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojna (SAGY) will have a cascade effect on surrounding villages and lift physical and institutional infrastructure across rural India, where basic facilities are often patchy.
“We are nearly 800 MPs. If before 2019 we develop three villages each, we reach nearly 2,500 villages. If in the light of this scheme, the states also create a similar scheme for MLAs, then 6,000-7,000 more villages can be added,” Modi told MPs.
Under the programme, each MP will take responsibility for three villages and turn them into a “model village” by 2019 through the convergence of different government schemes and their effective implementation.
Watch: Modi to adopt a village in Varanasi, urges MPs to follow suit
Modi asked parliamentarians to act as a catalyst for development in villages, saying the programme will help them identify bottlenecks and enable them to iron out these bottlenecks.
“Whether you get votes from the village or not whether the village community supports you or not, you will have to work for the village and its community and act as a facilitator, as a catalyst for its change,” he said.
The scheme was launched on the birth anniversary of socialist icon Jai Prakash Narayan, just days after the government kicked off its Clean India campaign on Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary.
Quoting Jayaprakash Narayan, Modi said while politics and democracy cannot be separated, the new scheme will open the door for constructive politics in the country.
Modi said it was not a money-driven scheme but aimed at the overall development of rural India.
“The talk about bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom will continue in the academic world,” he said. “We want to work. We want to see whether we can bring change through public participation.
 I am not claiming that I will change the situation all of a sudden … This scheme is not the ultimate. Changes and improvement will come with the passage of time.”

Benefits of bringing connectivity to India are going to be profound: Zuckerbergsocial networking
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s quest for the next billion Internet users has brought him to India for the first time. But given the lack of Internet connectivity and challenges related to affordability of services, he realises that Facebook needs to do much more than what it is today. In an interaction with media, Mr. Zuckerberg took questions on a wide range of issue, including freedom of speech, India’s potential and network neutrality. Edited Excerpts:
You are going to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. What will be the main point of discussion?
One of things I am really excited about is the Prime Minister’s Digital India mission. We want to figure out how we can plug into this mission. I am going to be interested in learning what we can do to help. Facebook is the biggest Internet service worldwide, and there are unique things where we can help out.
Other than the sheer number of people, what is it that makes India important for you?
Sheer numbers are an important part of it. You have a different dynamics and different challenges in building tools and infrastructure for so many people. If you can do it successfully in India, then you can do it anywhere else. This is a country which is forward on science and engineering. I think benefits of bringing connectivity to India are going to be profound. When you bring Internet to India, you are empowering people to build tools that can really improve the world. We, at Facebook, can play some role in making that happen
You said you will spend billions on things like drones and satellites to ensure Internet access around the world. How do you react to critics who say that there are more important things than Internet like toilet, food and water?
People need different things. Internet is an enabler of lot of things. People use Internet for health information, news and weather. People do not need any one thing alone. We are focused on Internet because we understand the dynamics well. We never say Internet is important than food or water. You need both. But we, as Facebook, are better suited to provide Internet than food or water.
You talked about barriers to Internet. In India there is the Section 66 of the IT Act under which people can be arrested just for liking a post. Do you think this a barrier?
We are focused on things we can do; which is making Internet access available to people around the world. Legal rules are a local thing. We can help be a part of the debate but a company like ours is not into trying hard to change the local rules in any country.
Can you give an example of how Facebook overcame a specific barrier in India?
One of the things we are doing is to enable local language. India has great diversity of local language. We now support 10 popular languages. We have more work to do there.
Any plans to monetise WhatsApp?
Over the long-term, there are clear models building businesses around messaging products. But in the next few years, our focus is on connecting more people.
Right now there are more than 600 million users on WhatsApp, we should have more than a billion people. In the near-time, there is no plan to monetise. Longer-term, we have ideas which we are thinking about but it’s not a focus area.
How difficult is it to get telecom companies to collaborate in your Internet.org scheme? What’s coming in the way of bringing this to India?
There are certain countries and certain operators who are forward leaning and want to try new things. So, we started in smaller countries where it’s easier to test things out. We are trying to build success stories in bringing more people on the Internet, and also make it profitable for telecom operators.
Once we have these success stories over time, then we can go to bigger players in bigger market in countries like India. India is an important market so we didn’t want to take a risk not doing it well. A lot of times, leading operators may not be risk taking compared to a challenger who wants to try a new thing first. All we need is to find some folks and show that it works and then over time it becomes clear that’s it good for everyone. It’s still early days.

Indo-Canadian Nadir is Canada s new envoy to...Air Canada
(Patel's appointment follows…)
TORONTO: Indo-Canadian Nadir Patel has been appointed as Canada's new High Commissioner to India, a move aimed at strengthening the relationship between two countries.
44-year-old Patel's appointment was announced by Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird and International Trade Minister Ed Fast yesterday.
"We are pleased to announce the appointment of Nadir Patel as Canada's new high commissioner in the Republic of India," they said in a joint statement issued by the Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development department of Canada.
"Patel brings a wealth of experience and will strengthen even further the Canada-India relationship, including on bilateral trade and international security," they said.
Patel, who had served as Canada's consul-general in Shanghai from 2009 to 2011, succeeds Stewart Beck.
High-level engagement is a key priority for Canada in the country's partnership with India, the statement said.
"In this spirit, both ministers Baird and Fast will be travelling with a Canadian delegation to India on October 13 and 14 for bilateral meetings in New Delhi," it said.
Patel will join the ministers on this visit. The statement said Fast will continue by leading a trade mission from October 12 to 17 covering Mumbai, Delhi and Chandigarh, and will support Canada's ambitious pro-trade plan to help Canadian businesses explore new export opportunities.
Patel, who was born in Gujarat, migrated with his parents to Canada when he was young. He went to Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo (Ontario) where he finished his undergraduation. Patel did his MBA from New York University and London School of Economics.
Until recently he served as assistant deputy minister for corporate planning, finance and information technology, and as chief financial officer at Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development in Canada.

Kmart is the latest victim of US retail data...Kmart is the latest victim of US retail data breach
By AFP | 11 Oct, 2014, 01.36PM IST
Kmart, which has a network of 1,200 stores across the United States, is only the latest US retailer to be hit by a cyberattack.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: Discount retailer Kmart said a data breach of its systems had compromised some customers' debit and credit card numbers, in the latest cybersecurity attack against a major US store.
No personal information, debit PIN numbers, email addresses or social security numbers, however, had been gleaned during the episode, which began in early September and was detected on Thursday.
"Our Kmart store payment data systems were infected with a form of malware that was undetectable by current anti-virus systems," department store operator Sears Holdings , which owns retailers Kmart and Sears, said in a statement.
There was no evidence that online customers at kmart.com had been affected, and the company gave no indication as to how many cards were compromised.
Kmart "immediately launched a full investigation working with a leading IT security firm" and was working closely with federal law enforcement authorities and partner banks, the statement said.
The company added that it had "deployed advanced software to protect our customers' information" and that the store would offer free credit card monitoring to customers who had shopped at the retailer September through Thursday.
Kmart, which has a network of 1,200 stores across the United States , is only the latest US retailer to be hit by a cyberattack.
In mid-September home-improvement retailer Home Depot announced a data breach that affected as many as 56 million customer payment cards between April and September.
The incident followed a similar case involving Kmart rival Target, which disclosed last December that hackers gained access to credit card data for 40 million customers and to additional personal and identification information for 70 million others.

Ebola toll passes 4 000 as fears grow worldwideEbola toll passes 4,000 as fears grow worldwide
By AFP | 11 Oct, 2014, 01.31PM IST
The WHO said 4,033 people have died from Ebola as of October 8 out of a total of 8,399 registered cases in seven countries.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
MADRID: The death toll from Ebola has passed 4,000, the World Health Organization warned, as authorities worldwide tried to prevent panic over the deadly disease and a Spanish nurse fought for her life in hospital.
The WHO said 4,033 people have died from Ebola as of October 8 out of a total of 8,399 registered cases in seven countries. The sharp rise in deaths came as the UN said aid pledges to fight the outbreak have fallen well short of the $1 billion (800 million euros) needed.
Spanish government officials were due to meet on Saturday morning for a gathering of their new crisis committee to tackle the crisis after a Madrid nurse became the first person to get infected with the haemorrhagic fever outside of Africa.
They have called for calm and vowed to boost health safety protocol and investigate what failings led to the nurse, Teresa Romero, getting infected.
Almost all the deaths have occurred in west Africa, but after Romero's death fears spread beyond that region about the world's worst-ever Ebola epidemic.
The Canadian government advised its citizens on Friday to leave the west African countries hardest hit by Ebola, while taking measures at its own borders to screen for potentially exposed travelers.
The US and Britain also boosted screening at major airports. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicted the number of cases could reach 1.4 million by January unless strong measures are taken to contain the disease.
From Australia to Zimbabwe , and Brazil to Spain, people who showed signs of fever or had recent contact with Ebola victims were whisked into isolation units or ordered to stay in their homes.
Authorities warned that hoaxes could trigger panic as a man was taken off a US flight by a bio-hazard team after he sneezed and reportedly said: "I have Ebola. You are all screwed."
Serious concerns remained in Spain over how the virus could have spread in a top specialist disease hospital.
Healthcare workers told AFP the quarantine floor of Carlos III hospital in Madrid, where 44-year-old Romero was infected, was shut last year as a result of spending cuts and only re-opened for the two missionaries flown back from Africa with the disease in August.
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy visited the hospital, where Romero, who caught Ebola while caring for the missionaries, was said to be in a "stable but serious" condition.
Doctors there took in three more patients for observation Friday bringing to 17 the number under surveillance, including Romero, her husband and other medical staff.
The United Nations and leaders of the Ebola-stricken nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone pleaded for greater help for the frontline of the disease in Africa.
The president of Guinea, one of the West African nations hard-hit by the Ebola crisis, met Friday with IMF Director Christine Lagarde, who promised the organization was "ready to do more if needed" to fight the disease.
UN Deputy Secretary General Jan Eliasson said only a quarter of "the one billion dollars sought" to combat the disease had been pledged. He appealed for doctors, nurses and other healthcare personnel to come forward.
His comments echoed a plea on Thursday from UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who said resources to support the fight must be increased 20-fold.
"Cases are growing exponentially," Ban said. "Do not wait for consultation. Just take action."
"We have to work now so that it is not the world's next AIDS," CDC Director Tom Frieden warned the heads of the United Nations, World Bank and International Monetary Fund gathered in Washington Thursday.
In Liberia, where the official death toll was put at 2,316 by the WHO on Friday, the government said it had banned journalists from Ebola clinics, arguing it was to protect patients' privacy.
The move came as nurses at the largest government Ebola clinic in the capital Monrovia staged a "go slow" to demand hazard pay, defying a request by UN health officials to avoid industrial action during the crisis.
In France, a public building was briefly evacuated in a Paris suburb on Thursday when an African man felt ill. Earlier, the arrival of a group of schoolchildren from Guinea had sparked panic at a French school. Ebola was ruled out in both cases.
Macedonia quarantined people who had come into contact with a Briton who died on Thursday after exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms.
Brazilian health officials Friday quarantined a Guinean man feared to have Ebola, but stressed it was a precautionary measure and the man no longer had a fever or other symptoms.
The Moroccan government called for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations to be postponed due to the epidemic.

India’s maiden spacecraft to Mars—Mangalyaan—has sent another image of the Red Planet, captured by the camera on board.

“Another full disc image of Mars, taken by the Mars Color Camera, from an altitude of 66,543 km. Dark region towards south of the cloud formation is Elysium - the second largest volcanic province on Mars,” the facebook page of Isro Mars Orbiter said on Tuesday.
The spacecraft had beamed its first photos of Mars’ crater-marked surface a day after India successfully put the probe into the red planet’s orbit.
Just after that Isro had uploaded the regional dust storm activities over northern hemisphere of Mars - captured by Mars Color Camera.The image was taken from an altitude of 74500 km from the surface of Mars.
India joined an exclusive global club of deep space explorers on September 24 when the indigenously-made spacecraft successfully slipped into the orbit around Mars after a 10-month journey on a relatively shoe-string budget.

Jayalalithaa to stay in jail  Karnataka HC rejects bail pleaHundreds of supporters protested on the streets and shouted slogans on Tuesday after the Karnataka High Court denied bail to AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa who was jailed by a Bengaluru court in a corruption case last month.
 
Jayalalithaa was forced to step down as chief minister of Tamil Nadu after being found guilty of amassing wealth beyond her known sources of income and was replaced by her close aide O Panneerselvam. The Bengaluru special court handed her a four-year prison sentence and a Rs100-crore penalty.
 
Unless the conviction is overturned by a higher court, the AIADMK chief will be disqualified from contesting elections for a period of 10 years from the date of the verdict.
 
Celebrations by the party cadre fizzled out after initial media reports that Jayalalithaa had been granted bail turned out to be incorrect. Tight security was in place around the high court complex with police anticipating a rush of AIADMK supporters and leaders.

Rejecting Jayalalithaa’s plea, justice AV Chandrashekhara said there were no grounds for granting bail and reacted sharply when Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh said he would not oppose if bail was granted conditionally. “The public prosecutor filed strong written objections but when he was asked to present arguments before this court, he said no objection.”
The bail petitions of Jayalalithaa's associates Sasikala Natarajan, VK Sudhakaran and J Ilavarasi were also rejected on the same grounds. The AIADMK chief is likely to approach the Supreme Court in appeal on Wednesday.
Citing several orders of the apex court, the judge said, “Suspension of sentence is not automatic (when an appeal is filed). Bail at conviction stage is different from bail when trial is on.”
“Corruption amounts to violation of human rights and leads to economic imbalance,” the judge added.
Watch: Jayalalithaa’s bail plea rejected by Karnataka HC
 
The 66-year-old AIADMK chief, a former movie star, has a cult following in her state and is renowned for distributing free laptops, jewellery and fans to voters.
On Tuesday morning, posters saying Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu would be held hostage if Jayalalithaa was not released from jail sprung up in parts of Chennai.
The AIADMK tried to distance itself from the row and its workers tore down the sheets allegedly put up by an expelled party member.

“Warning...immediately release people's Chief Minister Amma...otherwise we will hold Kannadigas living in Tamil Nadu as hostages,” read the message which also bore the name of several AIADMK members.
The party said the posters were put up without its knowledge and stressed that it stood committed to the welfare of all sections of society.
 

Test drive and review: Audi Q3 DynamicPrint
Competition makes us all better. The same applies to cars as well. The littlest off-roader in the Q family has just got better to fend off the swelling competition in the luxury compact SUV segment.  But unlike a routine facelift, changes to the Q3 Dynamic are not merely skin-deep as it is equipped with Audi Drive Select, which makes the car even more desirable.
Design
Modifications to the exterior are subtle, still recognizable. An all-chrome grille and aluminum skid plate are new in the front, while 17-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels add freshness to the profile. Clear lens taillights look particularly impressive and underbody guards on the rear bumpers ensure peaceful off-roading.
Interiors are full of soft-touch materials that look good and are well assembled. Brushed aluminum accents and walnut brown wood inlays are specially made for the Dynamic Q3. Electrically adjustable front seats with 4 way lumbar support offer outstanding comfort and the rear seats are certainly the best in class with excellent under thigh support and rear AC vents. Rear legroom, however, is not up to SUV standards.
The manually retractable 5.8-inch MMI screen controls many functions including the Audi Sound system with 10 Speakers and a subwoofer. Voice dialogue system, Concert Radio and Bluetooth with audio streaming are provided too. Boot space is generous and the full-sized spare tyre gives the Q3 edge over the Mercedes GLA that comes with a space saver tyre and the BMW X1 that offers no spare tyre at all.
Performance
The Dynamic Q3 will be offered only with the mighty yet efficient 2.0-litre TDI Quattro engine. This impressively refined motor makes 177 PS and 380 Nm of torque sent to all wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The test drive was limited to track and an off-road section, where the power delivery seemed wonderfully smooth and gear changes seamless. However, it would take a proper road test to be sure of that. Audi claims an ARAI fuel efficiency of 15.73kmpl, which is commendable, too.
Ride and Handling
The biggest change to the Q3 Dynamic is the Audi Drive Select, which tailors driving characteristics in one of three modes – comfort, auto or dynamic. These modes can be selected on the go using a button on the centre console or with the help of the MMI screen. Dynamic mode was ideal for the hot laps on the track, where the SUV stayed pinned to the tarmac even on the sharpest corners. The Q3 sailed through a high-speed slalom run as well, with minimal body roll and precise steering responses.
The very view of the off-road track was nerve wracking and my heart even skipped a beat while going on a trial run with the instructor. But behind the wheel, the Q3 is incredibly capable and poised under any extreme condition. The first obstacle, the rock bed, was easily soaked up by the Dynamic comfort suspension. The steep incline and decline was the most spine-chilling of all challenges but gentle throttle inputs aided by Hill Start Assist function made it child’s play. Audi’s acclaimed all-wheel drive technology - Quattro – worked seamlessly on the axle twister section, sending required traction to those wheels demanding it.
Well, rather than me trying to explain in words the all-terrain capabilities of the Q3 Dynamic, the following slideshow will simply tell you what this small SUV is capable of. Take a look

Why do you want to boycott Haidermore photos »
Last weekend, I watched Vishal Bhardwaj’s Haider . It’s been three days since then but still I can’t figure out why some people want to ban/boycott this wonderful film.
I searched the social media for explanations and this page -- Boycott Haider -- popped up. The main grouse of the protesters seems to be this: "Haider is a pro-Pakistani film and it "insults" the Indian Army.
There are no owner details on the FB page (no surprises here) but a tagline on the cover photo gives an insight into the owner/owners’ mindset and affiliations: “I am a patriot, I am a Nationalist, I am a born Hindu” (henceforth PNH). Another member of the PNH brigade has a cracker of a suggestion on how to hit the film where it is sure to hurt, at the box office. The PNH writes on the Boycott Haider page, "We must incentivise watching of a patriotic film like Bang Bang by sponsoring tickets for those who are ready to #BoycottHaider!" Truly creative, I must say.
Also watch: Haider is not your regular Bollywood film
video platform video management video solutions video player
It is true that the Haider does not depict the Indian Army the way the PNHs would like it to be: a benevolent force that can do no wrong. Probably, PNHs want soldiers to carry roses, not guns, in films. Even at the risk of being called "sickular" and several other unimaginative names, let me put it straight: while I believe that the Indian Army is one of the best forces in the world, has done/is doing a lot for the country, is one of the two institutions that still work in this country (the other being the judiciary) and must be respected, one must also accept that the Indian Army’s track record is not without blemish. This holds true for our paramilitary forces and police as well. In fact, no army in the world has a blot-free resume simply because of the kind of job they are expected to do.
Also read: Haider will hurt and haunt you
In Kashmir, as the film shows, the Indian Army countered terror with its own methods against Pakistan-funded and trained terrorists, supported and used Ikhwanis (who provided intelligence/local knowledge/information about militants to them) and of course, the men in uniform used horrendous tactics to extract information and many a times, made mistakes in identifying the real terrorists and ended up killing innocent people.
Here’s an interesting piece by an officer who served in the Valley in the early 1990s, when militancy was in its peak in the state: http://read.ht/jlj . There is no byline -- the author probably doesn’t want to betray the force he served (which is just as well) -- but doesn’t mince words when he agrees with what the film has shown.
And why talk about Kashmir only? Fortified with the dreaded Armed Forces Special Powers Act, the paramilitary forces have had -- and still do -- several run-ins with citizens in the Northeast also. Remember the photograph of Manipuri women who took to the streets naked to protest against the rape and killing Manorama by soldiers? In Chhattisgarh’s Maoist areas, where the CRPF operates, there have been hundreds of cases of abuse by the men in jackboots. Some are documented, some are not.
It’s high time that people start accepting the reality that places like MAMA II (interrogation centre) existed in Kashmir and its variants still flourish in other parts of the country. Whether one should support such strong-arm tactics or not; whether the Army was/is right in doing so (considering the tough situation it was working under and the brief it got from New Delhi) are a matter of debate and individual opinion.
But as far as the movie is concerned, the director did nothing wrong in showing these incidents in the film. Can a film on holocaust be shown without the gas chambers or the torture scenes? The same attitude (disbelief and anger whenever something goes against the standard belief system), is also seen when the personal lives of Indian political leaders are depicted candidly in movies. While it is okay to show them corrupt and scheming, all hell breaks loose if they are seen in the company their lovers/girlfriends.
It’s high time we realise that we need to confront many truths regarding the Indian Army’s conduct, however uncomfortable they are, and accepting that truth does not make anyone unpatriotic in any way.

Movie review by Rashid Irani: The evil doll is backActors: Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton
Rating: 2/5
A young medical student buys a child-sized vintage doll as a gift for his pregnant wife. Before you can scream ‘Chucky’, their run-of-the-mill existence is ripped asunder by the malevolent entity.
A none-too-exciting prequel to last year’s overrated The Conjuring, Annabelle plunders elements from its genre predecessors including the Child’s Play series featuring that demonic doll. Cinematographer turned director John R Leonetti is obviously also inspired by Rosemary’s Baby (1968).
Set in late ’60s California, the film begins in genuinely creepy fashion. A neighbouring family is slaughtered and the murderous cultists temporarily invade the young couple’s home. The hapless pair relocates to a new apartment, but the spooky moppet seems to be there as well. Fearing for the baby, the parents seek the guidance of an occult expert and the family’s religious advisor. But the goings-on tend to become monotonous. The thunderous soundtrack is unimpressive. Ditto the performances.
Not sufficient scares to affect your sleep pattern.

John Asterita / NBC NewsHow to pick your own apples like a pro
Ben Popken TODAY
Email
Did you know the apples you get at the store or farmer’s market can be months old? Farmers use various preservation techniques like cold storage, wax, and fungicide to keep apples crisp and on shelves even in the off season. But if you want the freshest apples and fun family outing, you can’t beat heading down the road to a nearby farm and picking your own off the tree. We talked to a few folks down here at Demarest Farms in Hillsdale, New Jersey about how to pick the perfect apple.
ASK WHAT'S RIPE
Especially earlier in the season, not every apple that’s out there is ready to eat. It might look big and colorful but it could be bitter or just not full of crunchy sugary flavor. Make sure to follow the posted signs about which rows are open and just ask the farm workers. They can tell you what’s ripe and what qualities to look for.
Video: For the freshest apples, you can't beat picking your own. Ben Popken shows you how to do it right.
HOW TO PICK THE APPLE PERFECTLY
Hold the apple softly
Gently give the an upwards twist and tug until the tree gives you the apple.
If it’s ripe it should come right off.
Lightly place in your bag to avoid bruising. Bruised apples rot faster.
Don’t shake the branch or climb the tree. That can damage next year's crop.
EAT THE APPLE
Don’t worry if the apple has a white layer on it, that’s just oxidation. And farmers say any pesticides were sprayed months ago and most have been washed off by rain by harvest time. Just give the apple a little shine on your shirt and it’s ready to eat. Chomp!

Nobel economics prize today: Winners usually American  usually pro-austerityprint
The winner of the Nobel economics prize is notoriously hard to predict, but it’s usually an American male opposed to big government and big spending.
This puts the typical laureate at odds with, for example, large segments of public opinion in Europe, where austerity is anathema, especially in the wake of the crisis.
So one of the big questions is: Will the prize depart from the trend of recent years and go to one or several economists favouring pumped-up demand?
The answer will come Monday when the award — officially Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Econonomic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel — is announced.
There are personal favourites. Here is one such pick.
Will William Baumol finally get the Nobel in Economics this year? In this age of entrepreneurship there can't be a more deserving theorist.— Gaurav Choudhury (@gauravchoudhury) October 10, 2014
The economics prize will mark the end of the 2014 Nobel season, which has honoured 17-year-old Pakistani Malala Yousafzai with the peace prize, along with India’s Kailash Satyarthi, and French writer Patrick Modiano with the prize for literature.
The economics prize might be the Nobel with the clearest laureate profile: It tends to be an American male aged over 55.
In the last 20 years, most winners have matched that description.
Many of them, working on mathematical models applied to specific issues — such as the evolution of financial markets or the behaviour or priceless markets — do not share their opinions on economic policies.
But among those who do talk about current economics, a majority defend what they usually call “economic stability” and “budgetary discipline”, and their opponents label as “austerity”.
             
'I'm conservative'
              
They are “neoclassical” economists, arguing that the state must refrain from any attempt to expand demand, but as a rule they don't maintain a very high profile in the media.
This is in contrast to laureates defending a Keynesian approach of boosting demand, such as best-selling author Joseph Stiglitz or New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.
Despite being publicly less vocal, the neoclassical thinkers are extremely influential in the academic world.
The University of Chicago, temple of neoclassical economics, has received more economic Nobels than any other academic institution in the world.
In 2013, for example, all three laureates were from the University of Chicago -- one upholder of stimulus and, more characteristically, two champions of austerity.
“I’d say I’m fiscally conservative,” said Lars Peter Hansen, one of the laureates, a month after receiving the award.
When asked about what the state could do to boost growth, co-laureate Eugene Fama was blunt.
“How about taking a year off?” he said. “One of the big outcomes of the financial crisis is going to be a massive increase of governement bureaucracy.”
The one 2013 laureate hostile to austerity was Robert Shiller — also widely considered more media-savvy, in the tradition of Stiglitz and Krugman.
Angela Merkel, Europe’s standard-bearer of fiscal displine, had nothing to fear when she held a pro-austerity speech in August in front of 18 Nobel economics laureates in the German town of Lindau.
“Germany’s experience shows that it is absolutely possible to have fiscal consolidation and growth at the same time,” she said. “It’s a big discussion topic: must we always get into debt for growth? We have proved in the last years that we don’t have to.”

Pathak: Soldier who keeps Pak in check | There s method in Pak s border madnessBSF
(Pathak, in the twilight…)
NEW DELHI: Devendra Kumar Pathak did not get much sleep on the three nights he spent at the border in Jammu & Kashmir earlier this week. Besides being alongside his men inside border outposts as bullets rained across the frontier, the director-general of Border Security Force (BSF) got encouraging calls from Prime Minister Narendra Modi , exhorting him to return fire with fire.
Pathak, in the twilight of his long career in the Indian Police Service, much of which has been spent fighting terrorism and insurgency in Jammu & Kashmir and Assam, is now the man fighting Modi's 'war' with Pakistan on the international border. Although cross-border violations are nothing new, the sheer intensity has made many rate the ongoing skirmish as the worst in a decade.
And much of the action this time has been along the international border, which BSF guards, rather than the Line of Control ( LoC ) overseen by the army.
"We have decided we will give Pakistan a thrashing for their misadventure this time. We have given them a very solid pounding and the loss on the other side is very heavy," Pathak told ET on Friday. "We have fired many more times the rounds Pakistan has fired. They have been silenced."
With his tenure set to last until February 2016 in the post, Pathak is the key man for Modi as things are expected to be on edge at the border given the new, aggressive strategy of engagement.
Incidentally, Pathak was the UPA govt's choice for BSF directorgeneral this April. Top sources in the new government said there could not be a better candidate for the key job given his years of experience on both the frontiers that BSF guards — those with Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Rajnath sent Pathak to Jammu
Hailing from Bihar, he joined the IPS in 1979 at 23 in the Assam-Meghalaya cadre and held charge of four districts as senior superintendent of police (SSP) in the two states at the height of the insurgency there. At the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), he was entrusted with raising the elite, specialist anti-Naxal force CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action).
It is, however, his deep knowledge of Jammu & Kashmir that is coming in handy for the government amid the unprecedented crisis on the western front. Pathak was CRPF inspector general in Srinagar as well as CRPF special director-general of the Jammu & Kashmir zone before he shifted to BSF last year as special director and then became DG.
"I do know Pakistan and J&K well," he told ET. "That is why I feel though Pakistan has stopped firing today, you never know what will happen tomorrow. After all, they broke their earlier promise from August to not resort to unprovoked firing."
Home minister Rajnath Singh told Pathak to rush to Jammu on October 6 after firing intensified on the eve of Eid. Sources said Modi spoke to Pathak on multiple occasions while he was in Jammu, exhorting him to raise the morale of his forces and hit back with heavy retaliatory fire.
"It is rare for a PM to speak directly to the BSF chief... Usually the home minister or the home secretary remain in touch with the DG. But this time, from national security advisor Ajit Doval to the home minister and the PM, he was the direct go-to man," one of the persons said.
Pathak declined to reveal what Modi told him. "The PM and defence minister made a public statement on our response," he said. He, however, said that spending tense nights in border outposts with his men and visiting all sectors on the international border was a conscious decision. "You have to do this to show the men that their DG is alongside them. It boosts their morale," he said. On one such night, while Pathak was at an outpost in RS Pura, India fired at 65 Pakistani border outposts inside 15 minutes.

People looking for food porn come to Zomato.xxx: GoyalPeople looking for food porn come to Zomato.xxx, says founder Deepinder Goyal

Deepinder Goyal is a first generation entrepreneur, but got support from his family when he set up Zomato.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
There was a time when people would rack their brains to search for a place to eat out. The online restaurant guide Zomato started in 2008 and changed that. With a few clicks, it suggested places you could eat or order food from.
Since then, the Gurgaon-based company has been on an expansion overdrive. Zomato's net is now spread in 16 countries. It entered four new markets by acquiring local equivalents of itself — MenuMania (New Zealand), Lunchtime (Czech Republic), Obedovat (Slovakia) and Gastronauci (Poland).
Last month, Zomato expanded its presence in Indonesia. The firm also won the 2014 Economic Times 'Startup of the Year' award. ETPanache speaks to Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO, Zomato, about all things food and business.
What does food mean to you? What do you consider to be soul food?
Food for me has always been about exploring and discovering cuisines. My need to discover food translated into organising menus and this gave birth to Zomato. About soul food, nothing hits the spot like butter chicken.
What are the new things you learnt about different food cultures through your job?
In Philippines, I learnt that it's rude to stay quiet while eating. In Qatar and the UAE, you never touch food with the left hand. In the UK, never leave a spoon in a teacup.
Getting into a new market is challenging. In which city did you enjoy setting up business and which were the places which were difficult to penetrate?
We had a memorable country launch in Lisbon, Portugal. The vibrant dining and internet scene makes it a great market for our product. Restaurant owners and the people in Lisbon were extremely receptive to our platform.
On the contrary, the UK entry was tough because of competition and the market size. The market is extremely fragmented in terms of discovery and transactional websites. When we launched in January 2013, we ran an outdoor advertising campaign in the London underground in advance to raise awareness about Zomato. In other countries, we haven't needed to advertise.
What features did you introduce to woo customers in the UK?
We offered restaurants based on categories such as 'great places for breakfast', 'pet friendly' restaurants, etc, based on the popularity of these restaurant categories in London. We recently launched table bookings by partnering with Opentable, Bookatable and ResDiary.
How do you know you are hiring the right people, especially in smaller cities and cities abroad?
We try to go beyond traditional hiring techniques. A person's personality and attitude are definitely what stand out during our hiring conversations. One without the other doesn't cut it for us.
We started 'Trial Week' for engineers and 'Leadership Program'that focuses on picking up former entrepreneurs. Of course, finding the right person can take months. Once we have identified the right person in the leadership position,though, it takes us about three or four days to make the offer.
From which city in India do you clock maximum traffic and for what cuisines?
Delhi sees the most traffic in India. It's by far the most exciting city for food in the country. There's been a high demand for global cuisines in the Capital with increasing demand for Italian food. We are also noticing steady user increase in smaller cities. With an increase in the number of young professionals with high disposable incomes, eating out has become extremely popular.
You are a foodie. What is the weirdest dish you have had till now and where?
Black pudding in London. I tried it during our London launch. A few of my colleagues and I had stepped out for breakfast and ordered a full English breakfast. When I had the first bite of this strange black mass on my plate, I made a weird face. My colleague informed me the dish contained pig's blood mixed with some oatmeal. I continued eating it.
Your favourite food dishes?
I eat out a fair bit (more than I like, actually). My favourite dishes are Galouti kebabs and butter chicken.
How do you maintain a work-life balance?
I am online from Monday to Saturday. On Sundays, however, I try to switch off so I can spend time with my wife Kanchan and daughter.
What was your parents' reaction when you quit Bain & Company to focus on Zomato? We hear you told them after you put in your papers. And are you a first generation entrepreneur in your family?
Yes, I'm a first generation entrepreneur. My parents don't really think about things once they have happened. When I told them I had quit my job, their reaction was "Ok, whatever, you'll figure it out". They asked me to tell them if things got difficult financially. My wife, Kanchan, has supported me always and is a big believer of Zomato. It is important having family's support in your entrepreneurial pursuits.
Is there a well-known person you have an unexpected connection with?
I share a great working relationship with investor Sanjeev Bikhchandani of Info Edge. He is more an entrepreneur, less investor. When Sanjeev and I met for the first time, we hit it off. It's been a great run since then.
On Zomato.xxx
Around 2010-11, people were starting to talk a lot about food porn. We realised we were sitting on an untapped opportunity. xxx domains are hard to come by and we thought it would be a good idea to get a xxx domain for the purpose of displaying delicious food. We have seen a great response from users.

Cyclone Hudhud threat: Tens of thousands evacuated along Andhra coast  OdishaComments
Cyclone Hudhud is surging toward Visakhapatnam at 180 kmph and is expected to hit the coast at noon,  said officials on Sunday as thousands in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa braced for the tropical storm.
Heavy winds lashed Visakhapatnam coast as Hudhud lay 110 km southwest of the port city. “Pre-cyclonic conditions are quite active six hours before the landfall. Heavy winds are lashing Visakhapatnam and surrounding areas. Wind speed can go up to 200 kmph when it hits the land,” said director of the Cyclone Warning Centre Ramachandra Rao.
Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on Saturday started evacuating thousands of people as Hudhud barrelled towards the east coast states, furiously picking up pace. By Sunday morning, hours before it makes landfall in Visakhapatnam, it would have attained its top speed of 195kmph, the weather office warned.
Live Blog Cyclone Hudhud
 
 
Around 1.1 lakh people in Andhra and more than 26,000 in Odisha were evacuated on Saturday as it started raining heavily and the seas turned choppy. All fishing operations were suspended in six districts of Andhra and four of Odisha.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high level emergency meeting to review preparedness. The National Crisis Management Committee also met after discussions with the chief secretaries of the two states.

Over two lakh people living in and around the vulnerable coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have been evacuated.
In Andhra, 370 relief camps have been opened in five districts - Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and West Godavari - where 396 villages are likely to be affected.
In Odisha, officials have evacuated 360 members of the endangered Bonda tribe from their habitat in the Bonda Hills in Malkangiri district. The state government began evacuating people from vulnerable areas to minimise casualties even as two flights and 39 trains on the route were cancelled.
Odisha administration officials visited seaside villages urging people to move but many stayed put. The police did not force them on to buses heading towards some 300-odd storm shelters, unlike during Cyclone Phailin last year, which left close to 30 dead and displaced 400,000.
 
Cyclone Hudhud: Evacuation begins in Andhra, Odisha
Keeping in mind the safety of the passengers, several flights to and from Visakhapatnam to Bhubaneswar, Banglore, Hyderabad and Kolkata were cancelled on Saturday due to strong winds.
Railways have cancelled the movement of about 40 trains between Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam and diverted many trains to other routes for safety.
Tirupati-Bhubaneswar Express, Bangalore-Bhubaneswar Premium Special, Jagadalpur-Howrah Samaleswari Express, Bhubaneswar Junagarh Express, Visakhapatnam-Secunderabad Express, Visakhapatnam-Guntur Express and Tirupati-Visakhapatnam Express are some of the trains which have been cancelled as a precautionary measure, said a senior Railway Ministry official.

East Coast Railway has made elaborate arrangements to meet the situtation that could arise out of the cyclonic storm and heavy rains.
Hudhud is forecasted to maintain its intensity for up to six hours after landfall before gradually weakening into a cyclonic storm while moving across southern interior Odisha and Chhattisgarh, the Met said. It will bring heavy rain to west and east Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts of Andhra and Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri, Kalahandi and Phulbani in Odisha in the next 48 hours. In addition, south Chhattisgarh and north Telangana will also receive rain.

The Centre has stationed 39 National Disaster Response Force teams comprising more than 1,680 rescuers along with 199 inflatable rubber boats in the two states and deployed 20 army rescue and engineering teams. The air force, navy and Coast Guard are also on standby.

Cyclone Hudhud nears Andhra coast  200 000 to be evacuatedCyclone nears Andhra coast, 200,000 people to be evacuated
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS –  Sat 11 Oct, 2014
Print
Visakhapatnam: With cyclonic storm Hudhud set to hit the Andhra coast Sunday, the authorities are preparing to evacuate more than 200,000 people in four coastal districts to safer places.
The northern coastal districts of Srikakulam, Vijayanagaram and Visakhapatnam and adjoining coastal district of East Godavari are bracing for the 'very severe' cyclonic storm, which is likely to make a landfall around Visakhapatnam Sunday forenoon.
According to Indian Meterological Department (IMD), the cyclone is lying 330 km southeast of Visakhapatnam and 380 km south-southeast of Gopalpur Saturday morning.
Fifteen teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and 250 personnel of army have reached the region while four naval ships and 10 helicopters of Indian Navy and Indian Air Force (IAF) are ready for rescue and relief operations.
The evacuation of people from coastal and low-lying areas will start later in the day. Officials said the number of people to be evacuated would depend on the weather conditions.
Winds along the coast are gathering momentum while sea conditions have turned rough. Visakhapatnam Cyclone Warning Centre has forecast rains from Saturday afternoon.
It has warned of rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy falls at a few places and isolated extremely heavy falls over West Godavari, East Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vijayanagaram and Srikakulam districts of north Andhra Pradesh and eight districts of south Odisha during next two days.
Squally wind speed reaching 50-60 kmph would prevail along and off north Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha coasts during next 12 hrs. The wind speed would gradually increase to 140-150 kmph around the time of landfall along and off north Andhra Pradesh.
The IMD has also issued storm surge warning. Storm surge would inundate low lying areas of north coastal Andhra.
Extensive damage to kutcha houses, uprooting of big trees, partial disruption of power and communication lines are expected.
Fishing operations have been suspended along the coast as authorities have warned fishermen against venturing into sea.
As there is no possibility of cyclone changing its course or its weakening, , Chief Secretary I.Y.R. Krishna Rao directed officials to be ready for cyclone relief measures on war-footing.
He said BSNL and other telecom service providers were urged to issue cyclone alerts to people living in coastal areas.
Round the clock control rooms have been opened at Andhra Pradesh secretariat in Hyderabad. The numbers are 040- 23456005 and 23450419.
Coast Guard, Coastal Security wing, Marine Police, and also superintendents of police were asked to be alert in view of cyclone and assist the District administration.
The authorities have set up over 200 relief camps to provide shelter to people to be evacuated from vulnerable villages. The government has cancelled leave of all employees and those who were on leave were asked to immediately return to the duties.
The district collectors said they have made arrangements to stock fuel, drinking water, food, medicines and other essential commodities for rescue and relief operations.
As a precautionary measure, the railways have cancelled over 60 trains and diverted many others in view of the cyclone.

For a place on the world stageUpdated: October 10, 2014 00:33 IST
For a place on the world stage
Arun Kumar
democracy
India seems to be happy to get from the big economic powers things such as surplus capital, technology, trains, cleanliness, education and so on. This also spells its weakness 67 years after Independence. We rejoice at getting the basics from others while giving in return our best minds and yoga
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while campaigning in Mumbai recently, declared that India has arrived on the world stage. Election rhetoric apart, what does it imply? We have been on the world stage but are not treated as equals. So, the question is this: after Mr. Modi has become the Prime Minister, are we now being treated as equals? Mr. Modi’s visit to Japan and the United States, and the visits by the Chinese President and the Australian Prime Minister to India, would suggest that India is being wooed by the major world economic powers. The Mars Orbiter Mission signifies India’s growing space prowess, though the credit for that goes to the United Progressive Alliance.
What are we getting?
Japan has offered India $35 billion of investments in the next five years and China, $20 billion. This includes a Japanese offer of a bullet train between Ahmedabad and Mumbai and a Chinese offer of cheaper and faster trains. Australia has proposed the supply of nuclear material and investments, while the U.S. has promised investment in defence production and cooperation in defence ties and energy. There have been offers as well of teaming up with Indian cities to make them clean and hi-tech, which would help fulfil Mr. Modi’s dream of creating 100 new/smart cities. That all this is happening in the first 120 days of Mr. Modi having taken over is creditable.
The importance of the Modi visit to Japan can be gauged by the fact that the Japanese Prime Minister accompanied him during much of his programme there. The Chinese President landed in Ahmedabad and went sightseeing with Mr. Modi. In the U.S., there was a grand welcome by the Indian-American community and where Mr. Modi’s speech in Madison Square Garden was a grand show. He met the CEOs of some of the biggest U.S. companies and got commitments for further investments in India. There was movement on jointly fighting terrorism in South Asia. Collaboration between some key Indian and U.S. institutions of higher learning has been proposed. The U.S. is also to help India in its fight against poverty and cleaning up its cities.
These promises need to be balanced with reality such as the Japanese refusal to relent on the nuclear issue till India signs the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Chinese committed much less investment than was expected given the rapidly rising trade with them, and which is skewed in their favour. It is not yet clear how the commitments to more balanced trade would work. The dampener was the confrontation between Chinese and Indian troops at Aksai Chin a few days before the arrival of the Chinese President in India and which continued much after. The Chinese also did not resolve the problems India faces in the production of oil in the South China Sea.
The biggest surprises were in the U.S. No big ticket investments were immediately announced. As the largest world economy, the U.S. could invest more in India but this trend may not reverse any time soon. It did not commit to supporting India on the food security issue in the World Trade Organization (WTO). Perhaps India’s reluctance to join the fight against IS is a major reason for why the U.S. did not commit to more.
The three “D’s” on offer
What is India offering in return for what it is getting? Mr. Modi mentioned it in the U.N. General Assembly; he referred to it again at Madison Square Garden in the form of the three “D’s” — ‘Democracy’, ‘Demographic dividend’ and ‘Demand’. Is this a big deal for any of the countries under reference?
China hardly practices democracy internally and the western alliance, headed by the U.S. has supported some of the worst regimes in the world since the Second World War. Does Mr. Modi care much about it? He ruled Gujarat with an iron hand. In recent election campaigns, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has gone about polarising voters. Ending policy paralysis should not mean that a Prime Minister has to be autocratic and marginalise his entire cabinet. There were disastrous consequences when Indira Gandhi centralised power in the Prime Minister’s Office.
A Prime Minister who is active and takes charge of situations does not necessarily lead to the building of a strong democracy. That requires the poor and the marginalised to be empowered politically, socially and economically. Yes, it is necessary to boost the investment climate in the country but it need not be anti-poor or anti-worker or anti farmer. Mr. Modi’s economic programme is largely pro-business despite the announcement of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. Thus, the democratic credentials of the new government are weak.
The idea of building 100 new cities would mean the draining of resources from the existing 8,000 towns and 6.5 lakh villages or more and which are already in poor shape. The creation of a bullet train service can only be at the expense of the existing and troubled railway network. The “Make in India” programme is targeted at big industry though there is talk of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME). This would adversely impact employment generation by displacing the small-scale sector and that could aggravate the already acute problem of unemployment. The democratic content of these and other programmes is weak at best.
The demographic dividend can only be realised if we have highly trained and surplus manpower. Unfortunately, training in our schools/colleges is by and large poor as the Annual Status of Education Reports (ASER) testify. Up to 40 per cent of academic positions are vacant in Central universities, the Indian Institutes of Technology and medical colleges, which reflects a paucity of good teachers. Unfortunately, of the people we train, a majority of the best go abroad. Which advanced nation exports its best students?
We have a large population but does that imply a large demand which could be attractive to international capital? India’s current per capita income is $1,500 which is only 4 per cent of that in the advanced countries. Thus, the average demand generated by an individual is small. India produces only 3 per cent of world GDP, implying a small market size. Since a majority of Indians are below the $2 per capita per day line, their demand is for cheap, low-quality products which the multinational corporations of the advanced nations cannot cater to. It is only if we are able to raise our people substantially above poverty that India can begin to offer “demand” to the advanced nations.
A one-way relationship
We seem to be happy to get from the big economic powers things such as surplus capital, technology, trains, cleanliness, education and so on. This also spells our weakness 67 years after Independence. We rejoice at getting the basics from others while giving in return our best minds and yoga. Did the Japanese or the Americans or the Chinese ask how much we will invest in their countries? Are we giving them some form of technology that they do not have? We are offering them our manpower for which we have to ask the U.S. for more H1B visas and more liberal conditions for exporting our manpower.
Forty-five years ago, we introduced the Rajdhani train service but have hardly speeded up our other train services since then; in the meantime, China has introduced fast trains. Why has our Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme not fructified since it was conceived in the 1970s? Why have we not been able to make a nuclear submarine? Our mission to Mars is admittedly a success but it has come 50 years after the first interplanetary missions. The more than 40 missions to Mars have laid the ground for our successful mission. Remember, in the 1960s there were no microchips or the massive computing power that exists today. So, it is an achievement but we need to be circumspect about it.
Why are we so focussed on getting foreign investments when foreign direct investment (FDI) is only 2 per cent of GDP? Our internal investment is 28 per cent of GDP and that is what has dramatically come down since its peak in 2008. It needs to be revived while foreign investment can only make a marginal difference to growth. Given the sluggish growth in Japan and the U.S., they are looking for markets and that is why they are offering investment in order to increase their exports to India. Is it in our interests to offer them our markets? If we keep aggravating social divisions and diverting our energies, can we become strong? Clearly, we lack a long-term strategy.
In conclusion, it is not that India has not been on the world stage but its relationship with other major economic powers has largely been one-way given that it has had little to offer due to its internal weaknesses. These need to be addressed urgently.

The Indian Super League commences Sunday with the intent of lifting the moribund standard of football in the country of 1.2 billion.
Veteran stars Alessandro Del Piero, Robert Pires, Luis Garcia, David Trezeguet and Nicholas Anelka have been signed by different city franchises in the eight-team league.
Yet in an indication of the pecking order of Indian sports, the ISL is using top cricketers to help market the game. India cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and retired maestro Sachin Tendulkar are among those with stakes in teams.
The 10-week tournament plans to nurture a strong local fan base for the world’s top sport while also developing young Indian players.

NEW DELHI: Come 2016, India may have around 800 model villages across the country, thanks to a new development programme launched by the government on Saturday.
Under the 'Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana', each member of Parliament will take the responsibility of developing physical and institutional infrastructure in one village and convert it into a model village by 2016 and do the same in two more villages by 2019. The Lok Sabha has 543 MPs and the Rajya Sabha 250, 12 of whom are nominated.
"The model of our development has been supply-driven. Schemes are made in Delhi and Lucknow and are pushed further. We want to change it from supply driven to demand driven," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, unveiling the guidelines of the scheme on the birth anniversary of social reformer Jayaprakash Narayan.

Dracula Untold: Fangless and bloodlessAP/Universal Pictures A still from the movie Dracula Untold.
TOPICS
English cinema
“Sometimes the world doesn’t need a hero,” says Prince Vlad who later turns into Dracula (Luke Evans) in Dracula Untold. “It needs a monster.”
That sounds promising. An edgy, horrific creature is just what a story about the world’s most famous bloodsucker needs; instead it gets a romantically tragic antihero. Director Gary Shore and screenwriters Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama have rebooted the Bram Stoker source material in the same mould as a comic-book origin story, and this doesn’t work.
To be fair, this isn’t Luke Evans fault. Ripped and ridiculously handsome, Evans is a great choice to play an anti-hero, except that Dracula isn’t meant to be some deeply misunderstood dude with superpowers. Dracula is an erotic, blood-sucking monster who feasts on vintages from the vein and inspires terror - but there’s precious little of that in the overly sanitised film.
The film even manages to cast in a sympathetic light that gruesome character called Vlad The Impaler – Stoker’s real-life inspiration for Dracula. The clash between the Romanian prince and the Ottoman Empire is the historical setting of Dracula Untold.
Young Vlad, forced into being a child soldier/slave in the Turkish army, unleashed a reign of terror by killing thousands of people - whom he then impaled on sticks, to inspire more terror. The Vlad we meet is the grown man returned to rule Transylvania as a model King, husband to Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and father to Ingeras (Art Parkinson). He is a sensitive man who believes in honour and parental responsibility – and there isn’t a pike or impaled head in sight.
Interrupting this idyll is the Sultan of Turkey, Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper), who demands that Vlad offer 1000 of his kingdom's sons – including his own Ingeras - for forced service in the Turkish army.
What to do? What Vlad does is trot off to Broken Tooth Mountain to meet with its resident monster (Charles Dance). The ancient Vampire offers a deal: for three days Vlad will get a taste of the Vampire’s super powers to help him defeat the mighty Turks. However, if, in this period, he drinks human blood, then Vlad will remain a monster forever.
Vlad doesn’t turn a hair at this promise of eternal damnation and accepts the blood-pact. Has Faust taught us nothing?
Much chaotic killing, running and swirling into bats ensues. The last, because as a result of the newly ingested Vampire blood, Vlad can transform into a cloud of bats, fly, see in the dark, mentally control bats and so on.
Even within this construct used by Gary Shore, many themes combining humanity and horror could have been teased out to explain the creation of Dracula – whether the oldest story of the fall from grace of Lucifer, or the idea of monsters lurking within the best of us, as in Jekyll and Hyde, or even Anakin’s taste for power that leads to Darth Vader. We feel no anguish for Vlad’s imminent damnation, or fear at the carnage around him. For all the – disinfected – gore, Dracula Untold is surprisingly bloodless.

Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg meets PM Narendra Modi & IT minister, agrees to partner govt in NOFN project

(Zuckerberg, 30, was on a…)
NEW DELHI: India could be the first country in which Facebook deploys drones to provide broadband connectivity in remote and inaccessible areas, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg proposing a pilot project to bridge this digital divide during his meeting with communications and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday.
According to people familiar with the discussions, the minister sought Facebook as a partner in the National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN) programme, which aims to connect 2.5 lakh village panchayats through high-speed broadband by 2017. "Zuckerberg readily agreed," one of the persons told ET.
He proposed that Facebook could contribute to India's Rs 21,000-crore NOFN project on last-mile connectivity. He spoke of alternate technology such as drones and satellite communications playing a critical part in this last-mile linkage.
"He said the company was keen on testing the pilot project in a few states in India, especially Seemandhra, given the state's emphasis on technology," the person added.
Facebook's Connectivity Lab is actively developing large, inexpensive, solar-powered drones that will be able to fly for years at a time, the division's engineering director Yael Maguire announced earlier this year. These unmanned vehicles will be about the size of a Boeing 747 but weigh only as much as four car tyres while serving as large connectivity hubs.
Keen on India Initiatives
At the Delhi meeting on Friday, Facebook also expressed its willingness to set up a server in India to handle the data transmitted through the drones and other alternative technology and comply with the government's security requirements, according to another person who spoke to ET.
According to people at the hour-long meeting, which included officials of the telecom department and the company, the usually shy billionaire was very forthcoming, listing a number of initiatives in which the Facebook wanted to partner with the Indian government such as e-health, education, providing free basic services and alternative technologies. Facebook didn't respond to ET's request for comment.
Under the government's ambitious Digital India initiative, the government plans use the NOFN project to deliver e-services in areas such as health, education etc to every nook and corner of the country.
However, reaching the end consumer--homes, schools, hospitals and other institutions-—may require wireless technology, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. This is where Facebook senses an opportunity to use its yet-to-be-developed drones.
  Facebook also sought the nomination of senior ministry officials it could liaise with on such projects, to which the minister immediately agreed. "We have dedicated some officials from my ministry to work closely with Facebook on their proposals to expand digital services in the country," Prasad said.
Two joint secretaries - one each from telecom and IT - will be the single-point contacts for the social networking giant, especially on modalities related to the alternate technology, including drones, that Facebook proposes to deploy in India, subject to security clearances.
To be sure, while the Indian government is keen on Facebook's participation in promoting local entrepreneurship and developing localised content for the Digital India programme, it remains to be seen whether it will allow unmanned drones to operate in the country.
The Mumbai police recently raised objections when a food outlet used a four-rotor drone to deliver pizza. Such airborne devices could face questions from the aviation regulator apart from any misgivings the security establishment may have.
Zuckerberg, 30, was on a two-day visit to India, during which he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prasad, besides industry leaders. He also delivered the keynote address at the internet.
org summit. The notfor-profit internet.org partnership was set up last year by Facebook along with mobile phone technology providers Samsung, Mediatek, Qualcomm, Nokia, Opera Software and Ericsson.
It's aimed at providing affordable internet access across the globe. Addressing the summit in the capital on Thursday, Zuckergberg had said that more than 1 billion people in India didn't have access to the Net and that he would discuss this with Modi.
The drones that Facebook is developing would fly at a height of 60,000 to 90,000 feet above the ground, far above commercial jetliners and at a level where they wouldn't be affected by the weather, effectively making them invisible.
In order to continuously provide Wi-Fi coverage, they would be powered by the sun, Maguire had said, adding that these could be tested in the US as early as next year.
Search engine giant Google is another tech firm looking at ways of providing internet access through drones and balloons. In April, Google outbid Facebook for US dronemaker Titan Aerospace. Facebook subsequently acquired UK-based drone company Ascenta for $20 m.

IS seizes Kurd HQ in Syria s Kobane  massacr...Jihadists seize Kurd headquarter in Syria's Kobane, massacre feared
By AFP | 11 Oct, 2014, 12.03PM IST
Kurdish militia were struggling to prevent jihadists closing off last escape route for civilians still in area, prompting appeal for urgent military assistance.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SURUC: Islamic State jihadists have captured the headquarters of Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian border town of Kobane, with a UN envoy warning thousands would likely be massacred if it falls to them.
Outgunned Kurdish militia were struggling to prevent the jihadists closing off the last escape route for civilians still in the area, prompting an appeal yesterday for urgent military assistance.
US-led warplanes have intensified air strikes against IS, which has been attacking Kobane for three weeks, but the Pentagon has said that there are limits to what can be done without troops on the ground. Washington also warned that the military campaign could lead to reprisal attacks "against US, Western and coalition partner interests throughout the world".
The jihadists' advance has brought the front line to just 1.3 kilometres from the Turkish border but Ankara has so far refrained from any action against the jihadists. Four straight nights of protests among Turkey's large Kurdish minority have left 31 people dead as anger flared over the government's lack of action to save Kobane.
IS now controls 40 per cent of the town, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. As fighting raged, an IS suicide bomber struck to the west of the Kurdish headquarters in Kobane killing two people, and 10 Kurds were killed in an IS ambush on the south side of town, the Observatory said. US planes conducted nine new airstrikes in Syria on Thursday and Friday, the US military said. Acorrespondent on the Turkish side of the border saw a cloud of white smoke rising above Kobane after coalition strikes yesterday.
UN envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura warned that 12,000 or so civilians still in or near Kobane, including 700 mainly elderly people in the town centre, "will most likely be massacred" by IS if the town falls.
Kobane was "literally surrounded" except for one narrow entry and exit point to the border, de Mistura said. The envoy called on Turkey, "if they can, to support the deterrent actions of the coalition through whatever means from their own territory."
"We would like to appeal to the Turkish authorities in order to allow the flow of volunteers at least, and their equipment to be able to enter the city to contribute to a self-defence operation," he said in Geneva.
The United States reported "progress" in pressing Turkey to participate in the fight against the Islamic State group, noting a pledge from Ankara to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels.

Govts bullet-for-bullet policy lifts morale of armed forcesComments
Just hundred metres from the international border (IB), a BSF company prepares to take positions in concrete bunkers as dusk sets in. Company commander Jerin Varghese begins to brief his men. “Last night you fired very well. Keep it up. Goli ka jawab goli se dena hai (We must respond to every bullet with a bullet),” he says.

Like all company commanders in the area, Varghese is relaying orders received through the chain of command. Sometimes they are told to give a “befitting reply” and at other times, when the instructions are to hit Pakistan harder in the face of increased firing from across the border, the jawans are told, “Hilne mat dena (Don’t let them move).”
“Secure your bulletproof vests and wear your helmets at all times,” Varghese says as mortars are loaded into armoured vehicles which take the jawans to their bunkers. Two kinds of mortars are being used — 51 mm that can hit targets at 800 metres, and 81 mm that carry up to five kilometres.
Read: Pakistan taught 'befitting lesson', says Modi
Over the past week, the 192-kilometre international border has been on fire and mortars have been met with mortars. But this time the Indian intent has been redefined by New Delhi and “Hilne mat dena” includes damaging Pakistani posts and fortifications and inflicting casualties.
HT got special permission to spend a night at the border outpost. The driver accompanying this reporter preferred to move to the safety of his uncle’s home, saying, “I got married in December. I can’t take any chances.” Varghese who heard the conversation smiled, and said, “I got married in mid-September, less than a month ago.”
“How many Pakistani rangers have we killed?” is a question that has suddenly come to acquire meaning and intent. Listen carefully and it is clear that the vocabulary of BSF officers has changed.
After they received clear instructions not to seek a flag meeting and to retaliate effectively, senior officers at the BSF’s frontier headquarters often begin sentences with, “gone are the days...” “Gone are the days when we were told to hold flag meetings... Gone are the days when we were told to be restrained... Gone are the days when we were told peace will be affected...”
A BSF officer in-charge of intelligence has gathered information — through technical intelligence and intercepts — and the force believes the Pakistan Rangers have suffered up to 40 casualties.
“Gone are the days ma’am. We have hit them (Pakistan) so hard, they are not letting their media into the forward areas.”
The Narendra Modi government has drawn a new red line in its Pakistan policy: fire will be matched with fire and the BSF is gung-ho.
But there are questions that need answering: how do you de-escalate? The military response may be clear, but what is the larger strategic vision? Will a “befitting reply” silence the Pakistani guns? Isn’t last night’s calm deceptive?
It’s not for the BSF to answer these questions, the soldiers say. They’ve left them to their colleagues in the ministries of home, defence and external affairs and to officials in the Prime Minister’s office.
On ground zero, Varghese and his men know a simple truth: every day, day after day, they will have to wear their bulletproof vest and helmets and stay alert in their bunkers. The finger will stay on the trigger – in peace and in near war.

Hudhud: Thousands evacuated along Andhra coastAndhra Pradesh
(National Disaster Response…)
HYDERABAD: Tens of thousands of people from low-lying areas of coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh have been evacuated as the state intensified preparations to face Cyclone Hudhud, expected to reach the northern coastline around Visakhapatnam by forenoon tomorrow.
As many as 24,000 people were shifted from Visakhapatnam district, 15,000 from Vizianagaram and 46,000 from Srikakulam and 160 from East Godavari district so far, special commissioner, state disaster management authority, K Hymavathi told PTI here.
She said that 146 cyclone relief shelters have been opened in the coastal districts.
National Disaster Response Force has deployed 19 teams (each comprising 45 to 50 members) to undertake rescue and relief missions.
In addition, a large number of Army personnel have also been kept ready in Visakhapatnam.
In Srikakulam, sea conditions were rough this morning. Met department has warned that extensive damage to 'kutcha' houses, uprooting of big trees and partial disruption of power and communication lines and minor disruption of rail and road traffic are expected.
"The government machinery is ready to face the cyclonic storm," said deputy chief minister K E Krishna Murthy .
Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy too is ready to help with four ships on stand-by. These ships have been equipped with additional divers, doctors, inflatable rubber boats, integral helicopters and relief material including food, tentage, clothes, medicines, blankets etc, in quantities sufficient to sustain over 5,000 persons, Navy sources said.
Six aircraft are standing by at the Naval Air Station INS Dega to undertake reconnaissance, rescue, casualty evacuation and air drop of relief materials.
Additionally, 30 diving teams and four platoons with additional relief material are ready to be pressed into action at short notice, sources said.
Meteorological department officials said a very severe cyclonic storm is now lying within the range of doppler weather radar at Visakhapatnam and it was tracking it since early morning, in addition to tracking through satellite and other observational tools.
According to latest observation, the cyclonic storm over west central Bay of Bengal moved west north-westwards during the past six hours and lay centred at 0530 hrs IST today about 330 km southeast of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and 380 km south-southeast of Gopalpur in Odisha.
The system would move west-northwestwards for some more time. It would then move northwestwards and cross north Andhra Pradesh coast around Visakhapatnam by tomorrow forenoon.
Under the influence of the system, rainfall, at most places heavy (6.5 - 12.4 cm) to very heavy (12.5 - 24.4 cm) at a few places and isolated extremely heavy (24.5 cm) would occur over west & east Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts of north Andhra Pradesh and Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri, Kalahandi and Phulbani districts of south Odisha during the next 48 hours, Met department said.
Rainfall would also occur at most places, with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places, over Krishna, Guntur and Prakasham districts of Andhra Pradesh and north coastal Odisha during the same period.
Squally winds, with speed reaching 50-60 kmph and gusting to 70 kmph at some places would prevail along and off north Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha coasts during the next 12 hours.
The wind speed would gradually increase to 140-150 kmph gusting to 165 kmph around the time of landfall along & off north Andhra Pradesh (East Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts) and 80-90 kmph along and off adjoining districts of south Andhra Pradesh (West Godavari, Krishna districts) and south Odisha (Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput and Malkangiri districts).
Meanwhile, South Central Railway (SCR) has announced the cancellation and diversion of several express and passenger trains due to the cyclone threat, a senior official said here today.
"About 28 express trains have been cancelled, 13 trains diverted (total 43 express trains) and 12 passenger trains have been cancelled.

Pakistan: JuD rally demands jihad against Indiaprint
A rally organised by the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) condemned the firing along the Line of Control (LoC) and called upon the Pakistani government to declare a jihad against India, a media report said Saturday.
A large number of JuD workers Friday gathered at the Karachi Press Club to denounce what they called Indian aggression that claimed lives of several innocent Pakistani citizens, Dawn online reported.
Carrying banners and placards inscribed with the demand to wage jihad against India, the participants in the rally shouted slogans and vowed to lay down their lives to defend their country.
JuD's Karachi chief, Muzammil Iqbal Hashmi said that terrorism on the Sialkot boundary was part of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policy of aggression, as he wanted to take advantage of Pakistan's internal problems.
"India should know that every citizen of Pakistan is ready to sacrifice his life for the protection of his country," he said, adding that the whole nation was behind the armed forces in their action to counter Indian aggression.
Other leaders at the rally said that India was violating the International Border in connivance with the US.
They also asked the Pakistan government for a 'befitting response'. They said that the Pakistani nation knew how to respond to the Indian threat and the nuclear bomb was made for the defence of the country.

After gaffe  Microsoft board to look at gend...After gaffe, Microsoft board to look at gender pay gap, male culture

Save precious time tracking your investments
SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO: A well-known picture in tech circles, taken in 1978, shows the first 11 employees at Microsoft. Two are women. One of them left two years later after a pay dispute.
Almost four decades later, the ratio has improved: About a third of Microsoft's 110,000 or so employees are women. But the company's pay practices and attitude toward women are still open to question and will likely be taken up at the board level, according to one director, Maria Klawe.
The issue hit the headlines and social media on Thursday when new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella suggested women in tech shouldn't ask for pay raises but should instead trust the system and rely on "karma" to get what they deserve.
He later said he was wrong, but the damage was done, reinforcing the view that Microsoft - and the tech industry generally - is a boys' club.
"He blew that question," said Klawe in a telephone interview on Friday. "He's retracted it. I think it's going to take us all to a better place. I'm pretty sure he's going to be thinking really hard about pay equity."
It was Klawe, a longtime campaigner for women in tech, who asked Nadella the question onstage on Thursday that led to his remarks, and she has since led the company's efforts at damage limitation.
Klawe, 63, said she has been pressing for hiring and promoting women at Microsoft since she joined the board five years ago, but the issue of pay raises for women had not been discussed by the board.
"I suspect it might be now," she said.
Klawe pointed to the recruitment of Peggy Johnson from Qualcomm as head of business development in September as a recent success, but she conceded there have been backward steps, notably the ousting of Tami Reller and Julie Larson-Green, who ran the flagship Windows unit until a shakeup in 2013.

Movie review: The evil doll is back with AnabelleActors: Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton
Rating: 2/5
A young medical student buys a child-sized vintage doll as a gift for his pregnant wife. Before you can scream ‘Chucky’, their run-of-the-mill existence is ripped asunder by the malevolent entity.
A none-too-exciting prequel to last year’s overrated The Conjuring, Annabelle plunders elements from its genre predecessors including the Child’s Play series featuring that demonic doll. Cinematographer turned director John R Leonetti is obviously also inspired by Rosemary’s Baby (1968).
Set in late ’60s California, the film begins in genuinely creepy fashion. A neighbouring family is slaughtered and the murderous cultists temporarily invade the young couple’s home. The hapless pair relocates to a new apartment, but the spooky moppet seems to be there as well. Fearing for the baby, the parents seek the guidance of an occult expert and the family’s religious advisor. But the goings-on tend to become monotonous. The thunderous soundtrack is unimpressive. Ditto the performances.
Not sufficient scares to affect your sleep pattern.

In pics: Modi hits campaign trail againComments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been in full-throttle campaign mode in Maharashtra and Haryana for the upcoming assembly polls. If the Bharatiya Janata Party wins in both the states, it will be another feather in Modi's cap. But the question is, will his magic work this time?
 
Here are a few things he has said and laid emphasis on during his campaigning:
Modi hit out at his critics in a rally for allegedly politicising the ongoing standoff with Pakistan along the border in Jammu. "Such an issue should not be part of a political debate. Don't use words that will discourage the soldiers fighting on the border," he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi shares dais with Shivaji Kardile (extreme right - in white cap) at a public rally in Rahuri of Ahmednagar district.
Modi requested crowds gathered at his rallies to not litter the grounds and clean whatever trash they come across. He launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan on October 2, 2014.
"When has the United States ever chanted 'India?”, Modi asked at a rally. The Prime Minister, at his election rallies, has been speaking about his visit to the US.
Modi has accused Congress and NCP of spreading lies that Maharshtra will be split if BJP comes to power in the state. "I assure you that as long as I am in Delhi, no power in the world can split Maharashtra and also separate Mumbai from Maharashtra," he said.
Modi has been talking a great deal about providing more employment opportunities and lifting the poor from their status in both states.
Modi raised the issue of farmer suicides in Maharashtra and promised that the BJP wants to work the development of agriculture.

(We expected correction…)
By Mazhar Mohammad
MUMBAI: Scary fall of the last few trading sessions, both on domestic and international bourses, failed to conclusively damage the uptrend prevalent in Nifty.
We expected correction not to exceed beyond 7,840 levels but markets in its wisdom has breached this critical level on intraday basis and chosen to bottom out at a low of 7,815 registered on October, 08.
This intraday breach nullified our preferred wave count but still we have two more alternative wave counts which are adhering to all the rules and principles of Elliott Wave Theory.
Hence despite global jitters and a scary fall even after 'positive noise' out of minutes released by Federal Reserve , we remain positive and based on Elliott wave counts and weight of technical evidence present with us we categorically conclude uptrend shall remain intact as long as Nifty trades above 7,808 level.
For this up move, internal wave structure relationships are projecting targets present in the zone of 8,212 - 8,272. If markets doesn't top out in this zone then based on Elliott Wave Logics this move can extend maximum to the level of 8,455/8,554 before concluding this ongoing leg of up move. However, if market breaches the level of 7,808 then downtrend will be confirmed.
Our alternative wave counts will become invalid and we have to retain our preferred count and will be forced to conclude that Nifty made a truncated top, in Elliot Wave Terminology, at a recent high of 8,160 registered on September,19 against absolute top of 8,180 registered on September,08.
In such a scenario we have to conclude that market trend is down and should be ready for sharp cuts and multi month corrective or consolidation phase(may be for another 1-2 months) . Based on this technical evidence we recommend aggressive traders to create long positions with a tight stop below 7,808 for targets of 8,200 levels on Nifty.
In simple words market trend will remain up as long as Nifty trades above 7808 level and downtrend will kick in if this level is violated.

Luxury cars create dream wheels for car aficionadosPic Courtesy: -
Amaan Ahmed
There was a time when just buying a luxury car would be considered a style statement. If you bought a Rolls-Royce, you had arrived in life. But today, driving these wheels of luxury goes beyond the brand name. It’s not about the style anymore, it’s about personalising this piece of luxury to suit one’s personal choices, preferences and comfort.
Realising the need for this exclusivity, many customisation firms have popped up, willing to tailor a car to a customer’s exact specifications. The scope for profit-making in this segment is tremendous and carmakers are now offering custom jobs in-house.
Opulent Choices
On a basic level, BMW has its ‘Individual’ programme, Mercedes-Benz has ‘designo’, Aston Martin’s got the ‘Q’ division and Lamborghini offers the ‘Ad Personam’ option for its cars. All of these let the customer choose from a palette of exclusive paint shades, different trim finishes, unique alloy designs, colour of the leather and materials.
If you move further up the ladder, luxury gets a whole new meaning. Stephen Hung, chairman of the Louis XIII Holdings Ltd, plans to open a luxury strip in Macau, including a hotel that will be home to the most expensive suite in the world. To serve his elite clientele, he recently placed an order for the largest fleet of Rolls-Royce Phantoms, creating a historic record.
He ordered a total of 30 extended-wheelbase cars—two of those being the most expensive Phantoms ever commissioned. These two cars come with bespoke touches like dashboard clocks designed by Graff (luxury watches)  and a dose of gold plating. Rolls-Royce pocketed a cool US$ 20 million (`121.6 crore) for the deal.
Bespoke to You
All these bespoke divisions will try to incorporate just about every single thing you’d want in your car, as long as you’re being rational. Rolls-Royce once had a customer who wanted the wood from a tree on his estate to be used in his car’s interior. There are also demands for exquisite picnic sets, replete with fine cutlery, family crests embroidered into the seats and animal skin to be used as upholstery. To make your car even more exclusive, Rolls-Royce will also reserve certain hues to make sure they’re never seen on another
R-R again
Ferrari also offers a tailor-made programme to its customers, which like the others lets them hand-pick the paint scheme, interior trim, liveries and so on. However, Ferrari takes things up a notch with its Special Projects division. For some buyers, just a unique colour or material aren’t exclusive enough. They want their cars to look entirely different from what’s on offer to the rest of the world. To cater to this particular section, Ferrari has the one-off department.
Luxe that’s Out-of-the-Box
As of now, there isn’t a new V12-engine open-top Ferrari that you can simply buy off the shelf. One customer didn’t like that, so he ordered Ferrari to chop the roof off its F12berlinetta supercar. The result was the F12 TRS, a one-of-a-kind roadster that’s thought to have cost the owner around US$ 4.2 million (`25.5 crore), making it at least thrice as expensive as the base car. But even this level of customisation isn’t quite good enough for some.
To understand this, you need to take a look at the McLaren X-1. The McLaren Special Operations (MSO) division accepted a request from a McLaren loyalist for a car that was based on the MP4-12C sports car, but had a completely bespoke bodyshell. Inspiration was to be taken from different walks of life: from classics like the Facel Vega and Mercedes-Benz 540K, various examples of architecture from the Guggenheim museums in New York and Bilbao, a Jaeger-LeCoultre art deco clock, an Airstream trailer, a Thomas Mann Montblanc pen, a grand piano and an eggplant. Yes, a vegetable. There was also a black-and-white photo of British actress Audrey Hepburn.
Within 18 months, the design had been signed off, and in just two and a half years’ time, the car was developed, tested and ready to be handed over to its owner. An MP4-12C cost US$ 285,000 (`1.75 crore)  and since this was a rather extensive overhaul, sources state that it cost about US$ 7 million (`42.5 crore). It seems that ‘expensive’ just doesn’t cut it any more. To be truly luxurious, a car has to be the only one-of-its-kind in the world.

Why India should engage more with Morocco

(Morocco advancing faster…)
By Tarun Basu
Two vignettes stand out from a recent trip to Morocco -- one, a smartly-dressed woman police officer flags down an errant male driver at a busy Rabat intersection and ticks him off for a traffic violation; two, the arresting spectacle of the setting sun dancing behind undulating sand dunes as one glides down an ultra-modern highway system that can compare with the world's best. Both fly against the conceptual stereotype of an Arab Muslim nation that is part of the Arab world but shares none of its puritanical conservatism; is part of the African continent and is yet one of its most developed nations.
A trip to Morocco is an eye-opener, in more ways than one, a peek into a country that is traditional yet modernising, where women enjoy a refreshing degree of freedom in both dress and movement that is unusual for a Muslim nation; a country that has maintained its rich cultural heritage while being comfortable with a strong influence of Western lifestyles, a synthesis of Arab, African and indigenous Berber streams, a country that has cleverly positioned itself as a gateway to West Africa, Southern Europe and even the US.
In the past decade, Morocco has launched large-scale projects aimed at elevating its infrastructure to international standards, the chief among them being the Tanger-Med port, one of the largest in the Mediterranean region and Africa, with connections to 130 ports in 65 countries; a modern highway and expressway network connecting all the major cities, 15 international airports, high-speed railway projects connecting some major cities and a wide network of integrated industrial platforms and free zones.
"Morocco can be a real partner for India in pushing its products and skills into Africa, particularly West Africa," says Mamoune Bouhdoud, the junior minister in the ministry of industry, trade and investment, small enterprises and digital economy, adding that Morocco was one of the few countries where foreign investors enjoyed the same facilities and privileges as local investors, including in purchase of property.
Bouhdoud, 32, who was educated in London and worked as an investment banker for Morgan Stanley, is emblematic of the new breed of Moroccan leaders who are out to carve a bold new image for an ancient country and are seeking to leverage on its strategic location at the crossroads between the east and west, north and south. They share with their monarch, King Mohammed VI, a vision for Morocco that the North African country "should reach the highest peaks and catch up with the most advanced nations".
Its traditional partners for years have been France and Spain to its north, its one-time colonial powers, its Maghreb neighbours (Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania) and a little beyond to western Africa. But with Morocco advancing faster economically than all its traditional African partners, and distancing itself from some of the regressive and repressive social and political policies of many of its Arab neighbours, it is now looking to countries in Asia and Latin America to forge business, trade and strategic partnerships.
In a speech on Aug 20, marking 15 years of his reign, Mohammed VI remarked the country's "development model has reached maturity and deserves to join the group of emerging nations once and for all".
 
Many in the kingdom have talked of building closer ties with India, the biggest importer of its phosphates, Morocco's main export, and of the country being a springboard for Indian exports and investment not just into southern Europe and west Africa but to the US as well. Morocco is the only African country to have a free trade agreement with the US, besides having 22 FTAs with African nations.
According to Forbes, which examined the country's rise, Morocco is seeking to position itself as "the next African superpower, just behind South Africa and Nigeria". It has been trying to diversify its economy, beyond its phosphate exports, by broadening its manufacturing base to include automobiles, aeronautics and an offshoring hub, and its movement south is "to reduce its dependence on European markets, including its historical partners, France and Spain".
Morocco, despite dire forebodings of many Western analysts, did not become an Arab Spring domino and had been spared from the kind of large-scale unrest that has swept some neighbouring Arab states, largely due to the foresight and prompt action by the king, who quite early on recognised the need to meet people's political aspirations, coopted the Islamists in the system while reforming the family code to give equal rights and freedom to women, a significant step in the Arab world.

146 cyclone relief shelters have been opened in the coastal districts. Hudhud is now within the range of Doppler Weather Radar in Visakhapatnam, and is being tracked minutely by the weathermen.
Evacuation of thousands of people living in low-lying areas in the four North Andhra districts began Saturday morning as the severe cyclonic storm Hudhud over west-central Bay of Bengal, moved further northwestward and lay centred about 300 km southeast of Visakhapatnam coast and about 380 km south-southeast of Goplapur.
HRD Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao said that all steps were being taken to ensure zero casualty. Already evacuation has begun in Visakhapatnam district in nine coastal mandals. The district administration is likely to shift 35,000 people. Traffic has been stopped on the National Highway to ensure no transport vehicle is stuck in the storm region. In Srikakulam, the district administration hopes to evacuate 1 lakh persons on Saturday.
Hudhud is now within the range of Doppler Weather Radar in Visakhapatnam, and is being tracked minutely by the weathermen. “Apart from the DWR, we are also monitoring it using other satellite guided observational tools,” said Director of Cyclone Warning Centre Ramachandra Rao.
The director of CWC further added that there has been no major shift in the direction of Hudhud so far and as predicted it is likely to make landfall over north Andhra Pradesh coast around Visakhapatnam by the forenoon of Sunday.
He also informed The Hindu that Signal number 5 has been hoisted at ports in Visakhapatnam, Kalingapatnam, Machilipatnam, Kakinada and Bheemunipatnam and Krishnapatnam has been notified to hoist signal number 3.
We have informed the district collectors of Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and East Godavari to suspend fishing and have alerted people in the coast and low lying areas, as the storm surge of about 1-2 meters above astronomical tide would inundate low lying areas of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts, said Mr. Ramachandra Rao.
Under its influence, there will be heavy to very heavy rainfall measuring between 6.5 cm to 24.4 cm over the three coastal districts in AP and over Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri, Kalahandi, Phulbani districts of south Odisha, in the next 48 hours.
Squally wind speed and gusting is likely to reach the speed of 150 km to 165 km during landfall over north AP and south Odisha.
The NDRF has already deployed its teams along the coast and the district administrations have started evacuation of people from low lying areas.
Railways have cancelled trains passing through or reaching Visakhapatnam on Sunday as a precautionary measure. Highway traffic is being controlled or diverted to ensure no vehicle is stranded on this section of the Highway when Hudhud makes a landfall. Navy and Army are on standby to provide humanitarian relief and rescue operations.

Burdwan blast: Man tells cops his house may have been used as hideoutThe probe into the October 2 blast in the old town of Burdwan in West Bengal deepened after it emerged terror suspects may have used a fourth house as a hideout.     
 
The police were told about this two-storey house at Hetudewan on Friday night.
 
 Manowar Sheikh, the owner of the house, told the police four persons — apparently, two couples — disappeared just after the blast at the Khagragor house. He said they remained out of reach on phone.
 
 Hatudewan Pirtala is just about a km away from Burdwan police station.
 
 The death of two persons — both Bangladeshis — in the explosion at the Khagragor house has brought to fore the possible existence of a terror network with wide roots in this south Bengal town.
 
 The house in Khagragor and two more were used by terror elements involved in subversive activities aimed at the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh.
 
 The police were reluctant to comment on the probe, but locals told HT on Saturday that one Sheikh Taleb took the Hetudewan house on rent about a month-and-a-half ago at a monthly payment of Rs. 5,000.
 
 Much like those living in the Khagragor house, the four in Hetudewan too avoided people of the locality.
 
 “Sheikh Taleb told us he was a resident of Kirnahar, Birbhum,” said a local who did not want to be named.
 
 After Manowar Sheikh told locals about the disappearance of the four, they advised him to contact the police. On Friday, the criminal investigation department (CID) sealed the house.

Fillip for child rights: Satyarthi  Malala win Nobel for peaceFillip for child rights: Satyarthi, Malala win Nobel for peace
Alan Cowell |  Oct 11, 2014 12:58 AM IST
Reaching across the gulfs of age, gender, faith and nationality, the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Friday awarded the 2014 peace prize to Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan and Kailash Satyarthi of India, joining a teenager known around the world with a veteran of campaigns on behalf of children.
At 17, Yousafzai is the youngest recipient of the $1.1-million prize since its inception in 1901. Before her, the youngest peace laureate was Tawakkul Karman, a Yemeni peace campaigner who was 32 when she was awarded the 2011 prize, along with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and Leymah Gbowee, a Liberian campaigner for peace and women's rights. Satyarthi is 60.
The awards, announced in Oslo by Thorbjorn Jagland, the committee's chairman, were in acknowledgment of their work in helping promote universal schooling and protecting children worldwide from abuse and exploitation, particularly young labourers in India, on whose behalf Satyarthi has campaigned for decades.
"The Nobel Committee regards it as an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism," Jagland said. "Children must go to school and not be financially exploited…It is a prerequisite for peaceful global development that the rights of children and young people be respected. In conflict-ridden areas in particular, the violation of children leads to the continuation of violence from generation to generation." "Showing great personal courage, Kailash Satyarthi, maintaining Gandhi's tradition, has headed various forms of protests and demonstrations, all peaceful, focusing on the grave exploitation of children for financial gain," Jagland added. "He has also contributed to the development of important international conventions on children's rights."
Despite his works, Satyarthi isn't nearly as widely known as Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012 for her campaigning for girls' education in Pakistan's Swat Valley. At that time, she was 15. Since then, she has become a global emblem of her struggle, celebrated on television and publishing a memoir.
"She has already fought for several years for the right of girls to education and has shown by example that children and young people, too, can contribute to improving their own situations," Jagland said. "This she has done under the most dangerous circumstances. Through her heroic struggle, she has become a leading spokesperson for girls' right to education."
For the previous two years, the prize had been awarded to international bodies - the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013 and the European Union in 2012.
This time, the winners were chosen from 278 candidates, 47 of them organisations, the highest overall number of candidates for the prize. The previous record was 259 in 2013, according to the Oslo-based committee.
In the speculation that invariably precedes the announcement of the award, Yousafzai had been a favourite for two successive years. This year, some forecasters spoke of Pope Francis, while others said it was likely the committee would withhold the prize, as it previously did during the Vietnam War in 1972 because the global horizon seemed scarred by conflict.
In part, the nomination of Yousafzai seemed intended as an inspirational message, offering a counterpoint to conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere.
Despite her international fame, Yousafzai has been seen as a more contentious and even divisive figure in her homeland. In the Swat Valley, which she left after being wounded in the shooting in October 2012 and evacuated in a military helicopter, there has been smouldering animosity towards her among Pakistanis who feared Islamists might one day return to the region.
Yousafzai, who has said she wants to become her country's prime minister one day, was treated for her head wounds in Britain, after the Taliban attacked a bus in which she was travelling.
Last year, she won several European awards. She has also published a memoir of her experiences, I Am Malala. The title echoed the circumstances of her shooting. When the Taliban gunman boarded her bus, he called out, "Who is Malala?"
As she noted in an interview last year, her voice is now heard "in every corner of the world".
British news reports said Yousafzai was at school in Birmingham, England, where she has lived since being treated for the gunshot wounds, when the prize was announced. She was taken out of her class to be informed of the award.
For his part, Satyarthi, a former engineer, has long been associated with the struggle to free bonded labourers, some born into their condition and others lured into servitude.

One-day cricket
Delight for Mohammad Shami, heartbreak for Dwayne Smith
A purposeful chase by West Indies gave India some anxious moments, but Dwayne Bravo’s men lost direction and presented the match to the opposition in the second One-Day International at the Ferozeshah Kotla here on Saturday.
In a contest it dominated for a major part, West Indies suffered a 48-run defeat that left the series level at 1-1.
Confronted with a slow pitch and a disciplined attack, India managed a total that was hardly going to serve as a fighting target. That it became one was more due to West Indies’ generosity. Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina and M.S. Dhoni never took charge when it mattered and the lack of purpose in India’s batting stood out sorely.
But the West Indian response was sloppy and the result went much against the run of play.
From a sound position of 170 for two, in pursuit of 264 to win, West Indies contrived to lose the last eight wickets for a mere 45 runs as India, propelled by Mohammad Shami’s four wickets, hung in desperately in the middle overs.
Dhoni was at it with frequent bowling changes that kept the batsmen under pressure. It worked well as the batsmen generously gifted wickets away, the one that hurt most was opener Dwayne Smith falling three short of what would have been his second century in a 12-year career.
The Indian bowlers excelled in controlling the flow of runs while the West Indians played their part by indulging in some shockingly poor strokes.
The brilliant effort by Smith was wasted as he was let down by his colleagues and West Indies once again demonstrated the unpredictable aspect of its cricket. For the home team, the 105-run stand between Kohli and Raina for the fourth wicket provided an inspiring momentum.
Kohli and Raina have little in common when garnering runs. Aggression may mark their intuitive desire to dominate, but Kohli comes across as much-matured and assured in conditions that don’t test his skills outside the off-stump.
It was this flaw that hurt his reputation in England when the moving ball and the seaming one caused cheap downfalls in eight Test innings. This was not the platform that would elicit a comparison but it was a burden that weighed on his shoulders. His failures had begun to invite criticism, some of it carping, and it was time for him to step out and take charge.
Kotla, his home turf, was an ideal stage. The team management convinced Kohli to drop down the order. The move elevated his form to the extent that he scored a half-century, not fluent all the time, but certainly bearing the stamp of concentration. Curtailing his penchant for compulsive strokeplay, he came to terms with his game in the company of Raina, who has been enjoying a good run with the bat.
Raina was into his stride quickly but Kohli played the waiting game. He had no choice really. He had to play to his potential and eventually he did.
On a slow pitch strokemaking was always going to be an arduous job. The perils of playing a bit early meant the batsmen had to be judicious. Raina had no such issues but Kohli was in a different state. The move to bat a slot lower allowed him the chance to not only study the game but also face an older ball in the 13th over.
It helped. Kohli regained some confidence, watched Raina thrive at the other end, and joined him in a constructive stand that resurrected the Indian innings. But the pace suffered once Raina fell to an ambitiously lofted shot, the catch taken on the line.
Then Kohli’s dismissal dried the run-flow even as Dhoni made an effort. But this was not a pitch that encouraged strokes on the rise and both Raina and Kohli paid for the indiscretion. Dhoni adapted and made runs that counted. In the end they did as West Indies frittered the game away.

We stand to learn a lot from foreign players  says SabeethUpdated: October 11, 2014 11:41 IST
We stand to learn a lot from foreign players, says Sabeeth
P. K. Ajith Kumar
soccer
With the kick off of the Indian Super League (ISL) just a couple of days away, C.S. Sabeeth is excited.
“Now, there is something we, the footballers in India, have to play for,” he told The Hindu over telephone from Margao, where his team, Kerala Blasters, has been based for the past week, on Friday. “With the ISL, many Indians would finally be aware that football is also played in their country.”
The 24-year-old striker is confident that the ISL would be a big success. “People are already talking about it,” he said. “It is nice that film stars, iconic cricketers and corporate houses are involved in the ISL; their presence ensures the media attention.”
He thinks footballers could do with some attention. “I am playing in Kolkata, where football is covered pretty well, but the same cannot be said about the rest of the country,” he said. “That has already begun to change with the ISL.”
Sabeeth feels the ISL would make domestic players more competent. “The foreign players signed up by the various ISL teams play at a different level, and we could learn a lot of things from them,” he said. “There is plenty to learn from even the way they practise.”
Sabeeth, who has already played for India, said he was looking forward to meeting the likes of Nicolas Anelka of Mumbai City on the field. “I have watched him play on television several times,” he said. “I could not have imagined that I could one day hope to play against him in a match. Yes, the ISL is a boon for Indian football.”
Sabeeth, who learnt his football in Tamil Nadu, is happy that he is playing for Kerala Blasters. “I had begun my professional career here with Viva Kerala, and was saddened when the team was disbanded,” he said. “That was a body blow to Kerala football. Now there are no I-League clubs in Kerala and that is the main reason football is suffering in the State.”
From Viva Kerala, Sabeeth went on to play for Palian Arrows, one of the few bright ideas of the All India Football Federation, but that team too was dissolved. He had scored nine goals for Arrows in the I-League in 2012-13.
“Arrows was a great opportunity for youngsters like me,” he said. “It is unfortunate that the team was disbanded.”
With not so many great things happening in Indian football, little wonder young men like Sabeeth just cannot wait for the ISL to begin.

Infy founders distance themselves from babyInfy founders distance themselves from baby
BS Reporters | Mumbai/ Bangalore Oct 11, 2014 12:57 AM IST
After 33 years of association with Infosys, the company's founders now want to step down and become one of the company's several shareholders.
N R Narayana Murthy has turned down the offer to become Infosys's chairman emeritus, saying he wants to "avoid any perceived conflict" at the firm he co-founded 33 years ago. He added he wanted to be an "average Joe". Also, the promoters - Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, S D Shibulal, S Gopalakrishnan and K Dinesh - have told the company they no longer want to be known as 'promoters'.
A STEP BACK
Promoters reclassified as ordinary shareholders

Cairn UK Holdings in Cairn India, after it sold majority stake to Vedanta Group
With the last two founders, Murthy and Gopalakrishnan, remitting office, the founders do not exercise any control over the affairs of the company. "They have, therefore, requested the company to seek appropriate classification of their revised status," said a company statement.
When asked about Murthy's future role, Chief Executive Officer Vishal Sikka said, "It is their wish. They have had an incredible impact on the country and on the industry. I'm going to look for continuous advice and guidance from him (Murthy). He will forever be known as Mr Infosys."
"They have been attached to the company for years and, for the independence of the company, they feel they should be classified as any normal shareholder," said Chief Financial Officer Rajiv Bansal.
The founders, along with their families, hold 15.94 per cent stake in the company. At Friday's stock price of Rs 3,888.9, the combined shareholding of the promoters stands at Rs 35,583.4 crore.
Analyst say reclassification of promoter holding in Infosys could further increase its weightage in the benchmark Sensex and Nifty.
It also means the promoters can take individual calls on the shares they hold, as well as distance themselves from any decision the management takes.
Currently, Infosys has greater weightage in the benchmark indices than Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), despite its market capitalisation being less than half of the latter's. This is because the indices use free-float methodology to determine weightage. Infosys has higher free-float market capitalisation, as its promoter holding is just 15.94 per cent, compared with TCS' 73.9 per cent. Wipro's promoter holding stands at 73 per cent.
Shriram Subramanian, managing director of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services, said: "It's the right move. Infosys will truly move out of the shadow of their promoters and become a truly public-owned company. Most founders have moved out of the company and are either in the directorship or the management. Narayana Murthy, too, has decided to give up the post of chairman emeritus. Therefore, there is no rationale for them to continue as promoters. The move will help them sell shares without having to do the tedious disclosures."
An issue, in terms of classifying a promoter entity as an ordinary shareholder, had surfaced last year, when private companies had to pare promoter holding to meet the Securities and Exchange Board of India's 25 per cent minimum public shareholding requirement. The regulator had rapped a few companies that had reclassified promoters as non-promoters which, Sebi felt, was an easy way out for companies to meet the public float requirement.
A framework to enable a promoter entity to become an ordinary shareholder is in the works at Sebi. Experts say the regulator doesn't have an issue with reclassification, as long as the entity doesn't have special rights and privileges such as managerial positions, which give them control. "The rules don't say 'once a promoter, always a promoter'. However, the onus is on the entity wanting to give up promotership to prove it is no longer in control of the company or has special rights or will act as persons acting in concert," said R S Loona, managing partner, Alliance Corporate Lawyers.

Rajdeep Sardesai expresses regret for scuffle in New YorkHere’s the full text of Sardesai’s note of regret: 
 
Over the last week, several versions have appeared on an unfortunate incident at Madison Square Garden when Prime Minister was addressing the Indian American community.
 
Through this period, I have chosen to remain mainly silent because I didn't want to add to the noise that has prevented any rational explanation.
 
However, I do believe it is important to put events of the day in context. I along with my camera person was outside Madison Square garden about three hours before the prime minister was to arrive. Our aim was to capture the mood, which was joyous and excited.We were able to reflect much of this in our coverage.
 
I probably took more selfies on a single day than ever before with the crowd. Sadly, a small group of people began to heckle and abuse us. For a long while, I smiled and shrugged this off and even tried to strike up a conversation to ease the tension. 
 
But after a while, the heckling reached a stage where we had to stop the broadcast as the crowd began to push and jostle. I was abused in terribly foul terms, my family was called names and I was kicked in the shins when my back was turned. The pushing and jostling continued even as I tried not to engage. I had gone to the event with hopes of goodwill instead the volley of name calling was unrelenting and shocking to me.My camera person and other witnesses would bear testimony to this.
 
A few moments later, I saw someone heckle me again and I lost my patience .I uttered an expletive and lunged at the person. It was an unfortunate response and one which I deeply regret. Whatever the provocation, there is no excuse for me to have got into a scuffle.
 
Over 26 years of journalism, I have endured a variety of situations but have always maintained my dignity and composure. No amount of provocation justifies a physical response.
 
I do, however, believe that surrounding, heckling and hurling vicious personalized abuse while a journalist is doing a professional job is also unacceptable. We journalists have a challenging job at the best of times and only ask to be allowed to perform our duties unhindered without intimidation.
 
The freedom of the press is an integral part of our democracy and should be respected by all.

NEW YORK: Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has admitted that the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group threatened to kill his employees after their Twitter accounts were deleted.
Speaking at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco this week, Costolo said that after Twitter started deleting accounts of IS members, he and his employees received assassination calls.
"After suspending their (IS) accounts, some folks affiliated with the organisation used Twitter to declare that the employees of Twitter and the management of Twitter should be assassinated," Costolo said.
"That is a jarring thing for anyone to have to deal with and I have spent a lot of time talking to the company about it," Costolo was quoted as saying in a report on the CNET website.
The IS has been "using Twitter quite effectively" to communicate and spread its message.
Twitter has responded by removing the group's accounts, citing such accounts as violations of the company's terms of service.
"It is against the law in many of the countries in which we operate for them to use it to promote their organisation. When they do, we find those accounts and we shut them down, and we shut them down quite actively," Costolo noted.
The IS has been occupying areas of Syria and Iraq and is considered a major threat by the US and other countries, which have been battling its forces.

Why 2016 may be Mitt Romney's year
New York Times Oct 11, 2014, 02.48PM IST

(Mitt Romney was the skilled…)
By Josh Barro
One of the main problems with Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy was that it was never clear what he wanted to do if elected. Romney's case for himself was heavily bound up in his careers in consulting and private equity. He was the skilled manager who could identify problems, root out dysfunction and make anything work better. The guy who rescued the Olympics. The guy who led the search for his co-worker's missing daughter. The Romney pitch was, in large part, about being manager-in-chief. It was a pitch with little policy content.
That didn't fly in 2012. But it might actually work pretty well in 2016.
The 2012 election had to be about the big "what is government for?" questions because huge policy decisions loomed in 2013. The Affordable Care Act would be implemented, or not; parts of the Bush tax cuts would expire, or not; entitlements would be greatly reformed in an effort to shrink deficits, or not. A large fiscal adjustment was needed, if not right away, sometime within the next few years.
Whichever candidate won was going to have a lot of power to determine the shape of the federal government for years to come, so he had to talk about what he would have the government do.
Barack Obama defended the principle that government ought to take a strong and active role in the economy, by using fiscal policy to offset the effects of recessions, by regulating the financial sector more tightly, by offering a near-universal health care entitlement, and by taxing the rich more.
Romney proved an awkward messenger for Republicans' big idea that the government should tax and spend less, and not discourage people from working and supporting themselves. The "47 percent" speech - essentially, a declaration that we'd have to grow the economy by making Americans less lazy - was the clearest example of Romney offering a big-picture vision that did not sell.
That failure sounds like a good reason for Romney not to run again. But in 2016, he might actually be able to bracket the big ideological questions and run on the small stuff.
The big questions from 2012 mostly got resolved in 2013. Tax rates went up, the spending cuts known as sequestration went into effect, and the Affordable Care Act is proceeding. The federal budget deficit has fallen below $500 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt will be stable as a share of the economy over the next decade. As a result, Congress will probably leave the federal budget more or less on autopilot for the next several years.
The health act has already been de-emphasized in 2014 midterm campaigns, in part because the existence of popular provisions in the law makes it awkward for Republicans to demand repeal without specifying a clear replacement.
 
While "what will government do?" was very much an open question in 2012, greater policy certainty means there will be more room to run on "I'll be a better manager" in 2016. That will be especially true if the news continues to be dominated by stories of managerial and technical failure in the government.
Healthcare.gov was plagued by "glitches." The Secret Service let a man with an arrest record and a gun get in an elevator with the president, and a man with a knife get near the Obamas' private residence. The Department of Veteran Affairs failed to provide timely medical care to sick veterans, then falsified records to hide that fact. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was overwhelmed by a surge of child migrants. The administration has faced criticism on coordinating response to Ebola in West Africa.
Even the big scandal obsessions of the conservative fever swamps - the Benghazi attack, the IRS scandals and Fast & Furious - are, after you strip away the conspiracy theories, fundamentally stories about managerial failure. And while foreign policy debates obviously have huge ideological components, there's a lot of room for dissatisfaction with this administration's execution on its strategies in Ukraine and the Middle East.
Whether the increase in gaffes is real or just perceived, there have been a lot of news stories that might lead voters to say, "Gee, this looks like the sort of problem Mitt Romney might have handled better."
Of course, to get to the point of making this case in a general election, Romney would first have to be renominated. The Republicans haven't renominated a losing presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1968, but then, no losing Republican nominee has sought renomination during that time either.

WASHINGTON: NASA has ordered the US multi-national Boeing Company and the California-based Space Exploration Technologies Corp (SpaceX) to restart work to develop space taxis to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) using their CST-100 and Crew Dragon spacecraft respectively.
Last month, NASA had asked Boeing and SpaceX to suspend work in response to a protest filed with the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) by Sierra Nevada Corporation, who lost the bid to build commercial space taxis.
"The agency recognises that failure to provide the transportation service as soon as possible poses risks to the ISS crew, jeopardises continued operation of the ISS, would delay meeting critical crew size requirements and may result in the US failing to perform the commitments it made in its international agreements," NASA said in a statement.
"NASA has determined that it best serves the US to continue with the performance of the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contracts that will enable safe and reliable travel to and from the ISS on American spacecraft and end the nation's reliance on Russia for such transportation," the statement read.
While Boeing Co got a contract worth $4.2 billion, SpaceX grabbed $2.6 billion fixed-price contract, to end the US's reliance on Russian hardware by 2017.

The Anthony Gonsalves generation: What Bachchan means to a 70s kidComments
The year was 1979. My dad had had a peace posting after a grueling field posting in Arunachal Pradesh. We were at the College of Military Engineering in Pune, Maharashtra. Cantonment life can be extremely charming. Old colonial campuses with open spaces, tree-lined avenues, spacious bungalows, huge public spaces like parks and playgrounds, multiple sports facilities, golf courses, army mess life with its various parties and balls, very unlike the cloistered small-town existence like my non-descript hometown Sambalpur in western Odisha had to offer.
Advertisement
Yet much of this was hardly of any significance to a 6-year old. Coming from largely conservative yet educated middle class Indian background, studies was all that mattered. Sport was the only other indulgence allowed. Barring that my parents did allow one more indulgence, strictly rationed though -- movies. We were allowed two films viewing a month in the hall. This was much before the TV era would begin.
It is in one of those moments of indulgences that I bumped into Anthony Gonsalves. Err... who? Well, sitting in an open-air theatre called Harkeerat Theatre in our cantonment on a rain-soaked evening, huddling close to my mother in a raincoat with an umbrella for cover, it was a magical moment, watching a man emerge out of a huge Easter egg singing 'My name is Anthony Gonsalves'. Ever since, movies have meant Anthony Gonsalves.
'Anthony Gonsalves' is someone any Indian born in post independence India would easily know. It was a character Bachchan played in 1977 cult hit Amar Akbar Anthony. Along with Lata Mangeshkar, there’s one name that comes to mind when you think entertainment – Amitabh Bachchan .
It must take something God-given to be loved by such a spectrum of people. I vaguely recall college-going cousins keeping day-long fasts and praying for Amitabh Bachchan when death came knocking at his doorsteps after the unfortunate accident during the shooting of Coolie. I recall my uncle’s driver Liaqaat telling me as a 10-year old how his favourite Amitabh was Iqbal from Coolie and how his much-loved song was the one Iqbal sings as pilgrims leave for Hajj in the film. I recall how daddy, bhai and myself would all break into UP bhaiyya style jig, with various degrees of grotesqueness, as Bombay Doordashan's Hindi music programme Chhaya Geet would run 'Mere Anganey Mein Tumhara Kya Kaam Hai' from Laawaris.
It is in these little moments that an abiding image of the man, his craft, his staying power and finally his legend emerges. For most parts, Amitabh Bachchan is famous for belittling his greatness, much to the disgust, actually revulsion, of an avid fan like yours truly. Big B remains one of the most powerful images of modern India.
If pre-independent India lived with the romance of a Gandhi, Nehru and many other stalwarts of the freedom movement, post 1947 India owes much to its popular culture (cricket and Bollywood) for being the emblems of Indianness, however flawed.
In the years to come, I was to discover more and more of Bachchan magic. His voice, his suave, his style, his impeccable manners, his sophistication, his seamless blend of east and the west would all slowly but surely dawn on me. But the most iconic remains his acting.
I got to know Amitabh first through his comedies. Dialogues that would regale me time and again –
Aisa toh aadmi life mein doich baar bhaagta hai,
Olympic ka race ho, ya police ka case ho’
-- Amar Akbar Anthony
Lo kallo baat. Arre babuji, aisi English aave that I can leave angrez behind. You see sir, I can walk English. I can talk English. I can laugh English. Because English is a very phunny language. Bhairon becomes Baron and Baron becomes Bhairon because their minds are very narrow.
-- Namak Halal
Tumhara naam kya hai, Basanti
-- Sholay
Such was his superb comic timing that few could match its acting prowess, be it the mirror scene in Amar Akbar Anthony or drunken act in ‘Daaru peene se liver kharab ho jaata hai’ from Satte Pe Satta. In movies after movies, Bachchan would regale with one comic expression or the other. Chupke Chupke, Don, Naseeb, Yaarana, Mr Natwarlal and countless others.
Much later, I was to discover the ‘angry young man’. More than his anger perhaps, his defiance against a failing system was soon to make an imprint as was his signature intensity. In Deewar, when his character says: main aaj bhi pheke hue paise nahin uthaata’, it didn’t just speak indignation, there was the underdog’s cry for dignity.
When in Zanjeer, he knocks off the chair as the local goon leader called Sher Khan (played by legendary actor Pran) is about to sit, and says: ‘yeh police station hai, tumharey baap ka ghar nahin’, I marveled at the guts of a police officer taking on a corrupt system.
In Deewar’s famous dockyard fight scene, even as Bachchan takes on close to seven men, one wondered how could a man possibly pull off such a ‘heist’? But seeing the conviction in his eyes, seeing him throw himself heart and soul into the scene, one was compelled to believe the impossible – may be, just may be, this guy had it in him to do all this.
As the cynical doctor in Anand, when his character bursts on his dead patient’s chest, shouting: baat karo mujhse, Anand, I wondered wherefrom did such sensitivity come?
His underdog act in film after film would invariably tug at the leftist leanings in me. As Vijay, Bachchan excelled at mirroring the angst of the have-nots. As Deewar’s renegade son, as Trishul’s illegitimate son of a rich man, as the ‘adopted’ son of police officer who would turn up against his dacoit father and renegade brother in Parvarish, as the sacrificing friend who would pay with his life in Sholay, as the rebel who would fight the corrupt landlord in Khoon Pasina, as a coal miner who would stand up against the self-serving coal mine owners in Kala Pathar, Amitabh would leave a deep imprint as a rebel.
Of course, I wasn’t done yet. There was the romantic side to him too. Mind you, Bachchan was nothing like a conventional hero should like. He was way too lanky and tall, his face wasn’t the sorts that would make a million hearts miss a beat, but strangely he brought in certain masculinity and a certain sexual quotient to the classic Hindi film hero.
On the face of it, there was just no softness in his demeanour so unlike his immediate predecessor, Rajesh Khanna from whom he was snatch the tag of ‘superstar’. There was no beguiling smile, no twinkling eyes, no tilt of the head, no emotional tugging of the heart strings for women to fall for. Yet in romances like Kabhie Kabhie, Silsila, Bemisal, Satte Pe Satta he wooed his woman with gutso and energy hitherto unknown. He made his woman revel in their femininity. Sexual love was fully explored. Even in films like Don, Namak Halal, Mr Natwarlal, Suhag etc that weren’t romances, the love sequences expressed mostly through songs, had tremendous audience approval.
My quintessential Bachchan remains the ’70s star. Come the '80s and '90s, and it left me completed disinterested. Agneepath is said to be one of Bachchan’s best, but for me as a fan, the fount of his genius seemed to have dried with the coming of '80s and more so, '90s. May be, he had aged and no longer made sense like before. I had moved on to Shah Rukh Khan.
Cut to 2000. Kaun Banega Crorepati would change the rules of the game. Suddenly, on my TV set was a new Amitabh. Gone was the guy with hagged skin and slouch-ish body who was wooing women like Jaya Prada. In came a sophisticated and suave individual, straight up there at once at ease with his Indian roots as he was a consummate global citizen. His wit, charisma and humour would charm him to his audience. I recall trying lazily to dial into KBC number in a futile effort to earn some fortune and get to meet my star. Alas!
But KBC enthused a new life into Amitabh’s career. Suddenly, Bachchan was everywhere – from TV commercials to newspaper adverts to hoardings to what have you. It was as if he had moved from monotonous grih hasta ashram to a rocking vana prastha ashram. Man, who knew old age could be so damn cool! With this new found ‘coolness’ came a plethora of roles – anti-hero gangster in Sarkar (loosely based on Bal Thackeray), a 10-year old suffering from degenerative progeria in Paa, romantic hero in Cheeni Kum, an ageing father (quite a romantic one too!) whose children neglect him and his wife in Baghban and friendly ghost in Bhootnath. Wow!
But is this not all that endeared Bachchan to me? Not quite. In his background lay a significant measure of his appeal for me. The fact that his father is one of the stalwarts of Hindi romantic literature (Chhayawad) had a lot to do with it. The fact that his family nurtured deep relationship with Panditji and later on with Mrs Indira Gandhi was immensely attractive. Panditji had a knack of spotting talent. He did it with Atal Vihari Bajpayee and would repeat it with Harivans Rai Bachchan when he appointed him as his Hindi translator.
Many years ago, listening to Amitabh recite his famous father’s poems in a collection called Bachchan recites Bachchan, would leave a deep impact on me. It’s progressive and modern worldview has stayed with me since. The world may be crazy about Madhushala, but my personal favourites remain ‘Kavi Dwar Pe Rakt Ke Chhap’ and ‘Buddh Aur Dancing Hall’. The manner in which Amitabh would recite them made it amply clear that he understood the import of his father’s words and that’s what made it so special.
It is combination of all these things that have added to the staying power of a man like Amitabh Bachchan. I have seen my father turn from someone who detested Bachchan for his larger than life portrayals (by the ’70s my dad, though an avid Raj Kapoor-Dilip Kumar admirer, had been completed taken in by new wave cinema of Shyam Benegal and Adoor Gopalakrishnan) to copiously crying like a child watching Bachchan play an Alzheimer-hit old man awaiting death in Black.
To quote Shakespeare in King Lear, Bachchan may be ‘four score and 10’ but to corrupt another famous Robert Frost line, I’d say Bachchan has ‘miles to go before he sleeps’.
Happy 72nd, my friend!

High drama in Goa  Congress bigwigs slug it outHigh drama in Goa, Congress bigwigs slug it out

Ridden by chronic in-fighting and corruption, the Congress in Goa is threatening to dish out more drama than the popular, slapstick Konkani 'tiatr' (theatre), after its outgoing president accused his successor of being a puppet, propped up by tainted party veterans in league with the BJP.

While internal rifts between the party leadership had sparked fears of an implosion, a sudden feud between outgoing president John Fernandes and the new appointee Luizinho Faleiro is taking the shape of a mega battle, if utterances by them this week are any indication.
Appointed at the instance of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi 10 months ago, Fernandes claimed that he was dethroned because he was getting under the skin of the corrupt leaders in the Goa Congress.
"Allies of (Chief Minister Manohar) Parrikar in the Congress were employed to hasten my removal. There is enough circumstantial evidence that Parrikar colluded with corrupt Congressmen to take control," Fernandes told IANS.
Fernandes also said the nine-member Congress legislative party (CLP) led by opposition leader Pratapsing Rane was already in the chief minister's pocket.
"The CLP is a floating company of the BJP. Now with Faleiro's appointment, the Pradesh Committee will also be on its way to becoming another company. I, as ex-president, will not let it happen," Fernandes thundered.
Fernandes, at his exit press conference, also made a serious charge against Faleiro, who until his Goa appointment was the Congress general secretary in charge of the seven northeastern states.
Quoting media reports in the past, Fernandes said the Goa government had dropped a forgery case against Faleiro's wife Rachel vis-a-vis deletion of names of tenants residing on the picturesque island of Zuzmobor, off Goa, purchased by the Faleiros some time back, alleging there was a quid pro quo between the new Congress appointee and the BJP.
Faleiro has rejected the allegations outright but has refused for now to join the slanging match with Fernandes.
"This is one thing I have learnt from (Congress president Sonia) Gandhi. Politics of mudslinging, of vendetta, of vengeance is one thing I will not like to do," Faleiro said earlier this week.
Asked if he would meet Fernandes in the light of the allegations made by him, Faleiro said with a boisterous laugh: "He is a Congressman. I will invite him. I would like to find out what he has said."
In a press statement issued by party spokesperson Sunil Kawthankar late Thursday, the Congress rejected the accusations by Fernandes and condemned his comments.
Faleiro, however, said it was time for Congress leaders in Goa to introspect why the party had fallen from favour and that his appointment was an "eloquent testimony of our failure to produce young dynamic leaders in the state of Goa".
"I don't want to cast aspersions on my predecessors, but my job is very, very clear.
"I have got an agenda; I have a road map. It is to bring unity in the party. Bring discipline to the party. Strengthen and consolidate the organization and number four to have a very intense membership drive," Faleiro said.

award and prize
The two struggled against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.
Kailash Satyarthi, 60-year-old child rights activist from Madhya Pradesh, and Malala Yousafzai, who has risked her life to wage a campaign for girls’ education in Pakistan, are the joint winners of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize.
“It is an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday. They were chosen for the prize for “their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.”
The Committee said Mr. Satyarthi, based in New Delhi, showed “great personal courage” and “maintaining Gandhi’s tradition, has headed various forms of protests and demonstrations, all peaceful, focusing on the grave exploitation of children for financial gain.”
The peace prize winner has saved thousands of children from bonded labour in factories through the Bachpan Bachao Andolan which he founded in 1980, and other organisations. On Malala Yousafzai, the Committee said, “Despite her youth, [she] has already fought for several years for the rights of girls to education, and has shown by example that children and young people, too, can contribute to improving their own situations.” Malala became a global symbol of the fight against extremism after she was shot by Taliban militants two years ago in Swat.

Reliance seeks sale of Eagle Ford stake for up to $4.5 billion: SourcesReliance seeks sale of Eagle Ford stake for up to $4.5 billion: Sources
Reuters | New York Oct 11, 2014 01:54 AM IST
India's Reliance Industries Ltd is seeking a buyer for its stake in the Eagle Ford Basin oil and natural gas joint venture with Pioneer Natural Resources, a sale that could raise up to $4.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
Pioneer, which has about 230,000 acres in the Eagle Ford Basin according to its website, sold a 45% interest in the property to Reliance for $1.2 billion in 2010. The Eagle Ford Basin asset is a three-way joint venture between Mumbai, India-based Reliance; Irving, Texas-based Pioneer, and a division of Mexico's Alpha SAB de CV.
Reliance has appointed Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to help sell its 45% stake, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.
Representatives for Citi and Bank of America declined to comment, while Reliance could not be immediately reached for comment.
The property for sale produces 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 60% of the production in liquid form rather than gas, one of the people said.
There are 472 wells on the Eagle Ford property, according to a Reliance presentation from July. Pioneer owns 46% of the joint venture, with Alpha SAB's Newpeck LLC owning 9%.
As part of its planned exit from the Eagle Ford joint venture, Reliance is also selling its investment in EFS Midstream LLC, an oil and gas gathering treatment and transportation network, the people said. The mid-stream joint venture was initially funded by Pioneer and Reliance in June 2010.
EFS Midstream operates 11 central gathering plants in south Texas, according to the company's website.
The sale process for the oil production assets and the oil and gas gathering assets is at an early stage, the people said.
Pioneer is the operator of the wells in the joint venture, which could complicate the sale process, one of the people said. The company is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with operations in several US regions.

BMW approaches Madras HC against Competition CommissionBMW approaches Madras HC against Competition Commission
T E Narasimhan | Chennai Oct 11, 2014 11:34 AM IST
The Madras High Court on Friday asked the fair trade watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) not to take any action against luxury car maker BMW, as it (the Court) decided to hear the carmaker's plea along with other car manufacturers’ petitions against the CCI Order.
 
In August 2014, CCI slapped a combined penalty of Rs 2,554 crore on 14 car makers including BMW (Rs 20.41 crore) for failing to sell spare parts in the open market. The watchdog said it wanted to make the components market more broad based, user friendly and less expensive for consumers. 
 
Some of the major OEMs, including Maruti, Hyundai, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and others have approached various courts.
 
Maruti Suzuki India, Mercedes-Benz and BMW approached the Delhi High Court against the order. The court in turn stayed a Rs 471.14 crore fine imposed on Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker, by the antitrust regulator.
 
The court stayed CCI’s order against BMW and Mercedes-Benz for three weeks and asked them to move the Madras High Court, which was already hearing the matter for other OEMs, according to earlier reports.
 
While the Delhi High Court's three weeks protection will end on October 12, BMW filed a writ petition at the Madras High Court today. After accepting the petition, the Madras High Court has asked the CCI not to take any steps to execute the order and to not issue any letter or make any demand, failing which the court will interfere.  The case was represeted by L Maithili Associates.
 
The court said it will take up the BMW case along with Hyundai's petition. Nissan withdrew its petition last month with liberty to approach the Appellate Tribunal.
 
Like other OEMs, BMW also argued that CCI had suo motu expanded the scope of its investigations to include the entire car industry even though it had originally received a complaint against three automobile firms - Honda, Volkswagen and FIAT. It also questioned whether the anti-trust regulator had the authority to expand its investigations on its own even if the complainant had not named a company in the original complaint.
 
CCI's investigation arm, the Director General (DG) showed the OEMs had violated competition norms with respect to their agreements with local Original Equipment Suppliers and the terms of their pacts with authorised dealers.
 
The complaint against Honda, Volkswagen and FIAT was filed in January 2011. In April 2011, CCI extended its probe to other manufacturers it found were following a similar practice.
 
Hyundai obtained a stay order from the Madras High Court against CCI's proceedings in February 2013. Subsequently, Nissan had also moved the Madras High Court, which in September 2013 stayed the DG investigation against all 14 car makers.
 
The Madras High Court’s single-judge bench in June 2014 disposed the car makers' plea. Nissan thereafter filed an appeal before a division bench of the Madras High Court which had referred the matter back to the single judge while staying the fine imposed. Later, the company withdrew its petition. It has the option of approaching the Appellate Tribunal.
 
The penalties have been imposed on Mahindra’s, Tata Motors, Toyota Kirloskar, Honda, Volkswagen India, Fiat, Ford India, General Motors India, Nissan Motor India, Hindustan Motors, Mercedes-Benz India, Maruti Suzuki, Skoda Auto India and BMW.

Amitabh Bachchan s most underrated performancesOn 72nd birthday, Amitabh Bachchan's most underrated performances
By IANS | 11 Oct, 2014, 04.50AM IST

In his over four decade-long film career, Amitabh Bachchan, who turned 72, has also delivered some performances which have been underrated.
ET SPECIAL:
MUMBAI: He's been the angry young man and the Shahenshah of the Hindi silver screen. But in his over four decade-long film career, Amitabh Bachchan , who turned 72 Saturday, has also delivered some performances which have been underrated.
Here's a dekko at the top ten such works of the thespian:
1. "Saudagar": Sudhendu Roy's memorable film of 1973, about a mercenary gur seller who marries village widow Nutan only to exploit her gur-making talent, is a classical study of patriarchal avarice. The Big B, with his dhoti hitched to his kneecaps, looked every inch the authentic palm-climbing toddy merchant. This is among his best to date.
2. "Parwana": The jealous and possessive victim of unrequited love who kills the girl Yogeeta Bali's father ( Om Prakash ) when he refuses to let him marry her, "Parwana" saw the Big B as a desperate lover, filled with sweaty angst. Riveting.
3. "Bandhe Haath": This psycho-thriller directed by O.P. Ralhan came just before the Big B shot to fame with "Zanjeer". He played the double role of a thief and a poet . This film brought the Big B face-to-face with the luscious Mumtaz.
4. "Sanjog": A 1971 ladies's picture, the film focussed on the very talented Mala Sinha , who is married to and separated from the character essayed by Big B. Many years later, she returns in his life as his boss. It is a South Indian melodrama, directed by S.S. Balan, where the Big B displayed his acumen for surrendering his ego to a character.
5. "Bemisaal": Of all the films that the Big B and Hrishikesh Mukherjee collaborated on, this one under-performed the most. But Big B playing the faithful adopted son in a middle-class family with a dark and dangerous past, displayed tremendous chemistry in his scenes with Raakhee who played his best friend's wife.
6. "Faraar": Big B played a fugitive on the run who takes shelter in his former sweetheart's home where she's now happily married to her policeman husband. The bond that the fugitive forms with his former beloved's little son, was astonishing in its filial authenticity. "Faraar", a flop, is forgotten today.
7. "Alaap": The unsuccessful Hrishikesh Mukherjee-Big B collaboration oozed despondency and despair. The Big B was utterly credible as the hotshot lawyer Om Prakash' son who prefers to spend time with a classical singer rather than practising his father's craft.
8. "Main Azaad Hoon": Tinu Anand, one of the Big B's closest friends, fashioned this desi remake of Frank Capra's "Meet John Doe". The Big B personified the rise of Everyman to a national hero. It was a rousing performance rendered to perfection.
9. "Manzil": This film, which brought the Big B together with director Basu Chatterjee, featured the actor as an over-reacher filled with destructive middle-class dreams of affluence. The shades of grey always enhanced the Big B's performance.
10. "Nishabd": As a 60-plus man desperately in love with his daughter's friend, the Big B conveyed all the anguish of a hopeless passion, plus more. His monologue of guilt and repentance at the end as he looks straight into the camera is among his most accomplished performances in the post "Mohabbatein" phase of his career when he entered another innings. Ram Gopal Varma , take a bow.

Ebola screening to be stepped up at NYC air...Ebola
(Customs officials say about…)
NEW YORK: A stepped-up screening program to check the temperatures of travelers arriving from West Africa is starting at New York's Kennedy International Airport , part of an effort to stop the spread of Ebola.
The effort to screen travelers from the three West African countries most affected by Ebola starts today at Kennedy and will be expanded over the next week to Newark Liberty, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta.
Customs officials say about 150 people travel daily from or through Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea to the United States, and nearly 95 per cent of them land first at one of the five airports.
There are no direct flights to the US from the three countries, but Homeland Security officials said last week they can track passengers back to where their trips began, even if they make several stops. Airlines from Morocco, France and Belgium are still flying in and out of West Africa.
President Barack Obama said Wednesday that the new screening measures support protections already in place. Border Patrol agents already look for people who are obviously ill, as do flight crews, and passengers departing from West Africa are being screened.
Public health workers at Kennedy Airport will use no-touch thermometers to take the temperatures of the travelers from the three Ebola-ravaged countries; those who have a fever will be interviewed to determine whether they may have had contact with someone infected with Ebola.
There are quarantine areas at each of the five airports that can be used if necessary.
Health officials expect false alarms from travelers who have fever from other illnesses. Ebola isn't contagious until symptoms begin, and it spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of patients.
The extra screening at US airports probably wouldn't have identified Thomas Eric Duncan when he arrived from Liberia last month because he had no symptoms while traveling. Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US, died Wednesday in Dallas.

Could have raped after polls: RR Patil s remarks on rape accused candidate'MNS candidate could've committed rape after polls'
Yogesh Joshi , Hindustan Times  Pune, October 11, 2014
First Published: 16:05 IST(11/10/2014) | Last Updated: 00:58 IST(12/10/2014)
Comments
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and former home minister RR Patil while commenting on rival MNS candidate's criminal background said he should have committed rape at least after elections.
Patil's comments, caught on camera, sparked a major controversy with rivals lapping it up to turn the heat against Patil and NCP.
Patil has been facing a bitter electoral battle from Kawathe-Mahankal assembly constituency with BJP nominee Ajit Ghorpade posing a major challenge.
The controversial remarks made the by former home minister came on Thursday while he was addressing a public meeting in Kawathe-Ekand, in Sangli district.
In the meeting, Patil narrated morning's incident about his meeting with the supporters of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) candidate Sudhakar Khade.
According to Patil, these supporters had come to extend their support as Khade was behind the bars facing rape and molestation charges.
Addressing the crowd, Patil said, "Supporters of MNS candidate had come to meet me to extend their support since their own candidate is behind bars. I told them, if he wanted to contest elections to become a legislator, he should have committed rape at least after the elections."
Realizing that his remarks may cause immense damage especially when assembly elections are just four days away, Patil expressed regrets. "My comments were of satirical nature. I regret if anyone feels hurt. I have no intentions to insult women."
Patil added saying his comments were directed at MNS candidate who has criminal background. Khade, a history sheeter is contesting elections on MNS ticket though he was previously with Shiv Sena. Khade was first accused of rape in 2007. In 2011, he was charged in another rape and molestation case.
Criticizing Patil, Sanjay Patil, a BJP MP from Sangli said, "People like Patil have always taken names of Shahu-Phule-Ambedkar. Today they have been exposed before the society."
Found cornered over party nominee's criminal background, MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar said, "Person at stature of RR Patil should have thought twice while commenting against MNS candidate who has been falsely implicated in criminal cases."
Previously too Patil was surrounded by controversy when his remarks in the aftermath of 26/11 Mumbai drew severe criticism. Patil was accused of downplaying the severity of attacks saying, "In big cities like this, small things do happen." His comments attracted flack eventually forcing him to resign as home minister.

NEW DELHI: Come 2016, India may have around 800 model villages across the country, thanks to a new development programme launched by the government on Saturday.
Under the 'Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana', each member of Parliament will take the responsibility of developing physical and institutional infrastructure in one village and convert it into a model village by 2016 and do the same in two more villages by 2019. The Lok Sabha has 543 MPs and the Rajya Sabha 250, 12 of whom are nominated.
"The model of our development has been supply-driven. Schemes are made in Delhi and Lucknow and are pushed further. We want to change it from supply driven to demand driven," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, unveiling the guidelines of the scheme on the birth anniversary of social reformer Jayaprakash Narayan.

Nadella s remark highlights a paradox on wom...Satya Nadella's remark highlights a paradox on women's wages
New York Times Oct 11, 2014, 02.53PM IST

Insurability
(After uproar about his comments, Nadella quickly…)
When Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, told a conference of women in tech on Thursday that they should not ask for a raise, but trust "faith" and "karma" to reward them appropriately, he not only caused an immediate stir at his own company and other tech companies, but also touched a nerve among women in other industries.
Alexis Fritzsche, who works in sales in San Francisco, said Nadella's comments would inspire her and her friends to ask for raises, rather than discouraging them.
"The conversation around salary, the conversation around the art of women asking and how to ask are conversations that are happening organically already between my friends and myself," she said. "For us, it only fuels the fire that they should be asking for raises."
For one female engineer in Chicago, Nadella's remarks were a reminder to ask not just for a raise but also for more challenging opportunities at work.
"The comments just reminded me that you have to keep up with it," said the woman, who did not want to be identified talking about compensation. "I keep becoming more aware of how it's not just about me. If I don't ask, I'm hurting others too."
Meanwhile, Sandra Guillen, a translator and interpreter in New York, said she would never tell her employees not to ask for a raise, either. "I will not let his outrageous comments deter me from asking for a raise if I know and I can prove that I have done a great job and exceed all expectations," she said. After the uproar about his comments, Nadella quickly backtracked, writing Microsoft employees, "If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask."
But the furor highlighted one of the country's biggest workplace paradoxes: Even as women are becoming more educated than men and achieving higher career levels than ever before, they are still treated differently at work, including receiving median pay of about 20 per cent less than their male counterparts.
One reason is that women negotiate less than men, including for higher pay. When they do, they are penalized, largely because of preconceived notions about gender roles that have not caught up with women's role in the workplace. It is expected that men promote themselves and speak up, but not women.
"It basically violates the expectations about how we think women are supposed to be," said Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a leading researcher on women and pay negotiations. "The literature talks about women being communal, kind, interested in others, helpful, not aggressive. When people violate expectations, there's backlash against them."
 
Within the tech industry, Nadella's comments particularly hit home. The industry generally has been under fire for its low numbers of women and in some cases poor treatment of them. Tech companies have lately been issuing reports on the diversity of their workforces; generally, about one-third of all employees and fewer than 20 per cent of technical employees are female. "His comments are illustrative of a double standard for women in tech," said Monica Harrington, a former senior manager at Microsoft who said the problem was far bigger than just one executive. "It's scary to see him say out loud what so many men think. Women have to advocate for themselves, but bosses can't penalize them for doing so."
Nadella's advice on asking for a raise was not the only message on this topic given at the conference, the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. Before Nadella made his remarks, Blake Irving, chief executive of GoDaddy, gave the opposite advice, telling women they should "speak up, be confident." Nadella's remarks also reignited a longstanding debate about whose responsibility it is to close the pay gap and otherwise ensure that women are treated equally at work.
In the 1960s, feminists encouraged collective action with the mantra, "The personal is political." Today, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, urges women to speak up for themselves, while her critics say she emphasizes personal responsibility too much and that workplaces and public policy are what needs to change.
"We get the message that we just need to go and negotiate ourselves, but the research clearly finds that it's a tricky proposition for women, to say the least," said Laura Kray, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business who studies negotiation and gender stereotypes. "But then organizations aren't doing what they need to do to rectify this problem. Everyone's kind of throwing up their hands and saying, 'How are we going to make progress on this?'"

In e-commerce world  let the consumer be kingIn e-commerce world, let the consumer be king
Shishir Asthana | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 03:35 PM IST
Just when shopping was getting interesting, the government is getting ready to play spoilsport. A day after Flipkart experienced outrage over failed transactions on its Big Billion Day sale, reports said that the poster boy of Indian e-commerce is likely to face government scrutiny on complaints of predatory pricing.
 
Retail traders are known to be a vote bank for the present government; it is only likely that th
e government will listen to their complaints. "We have received many inputs. Lot of concerns have been expressed. We will look into it," Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has been reported as saying. “Whether there is a need for a separate policy or some kind of clarification is needed, we will make it clear soon.” 
 
But it is not traders alone who are complaining, especially after the ‘Big Billion Day’ sale. For a start it was more of a fiasco than a sale. Complaining customers, crashing sites, vanishing carts, poaching competitors, you name it, it was all there. But the underlying fact is that Flipkart still managed to sell $100 million of goods in 10 hours. And this is just Flipkart alone. Snapdeal and Amazon also had record sales on the same day, capitalising on Flipkart’s misery by announcing matching or better deals.
 
As Victor Hugo said all the forces in the world are not as powerful as an idea whose time has come. Big Billion Day has announced the presence of e-commerce with a bang. It has rocked the boat of established players who now feel threatened and have run to the government complaining of fair play.
 
Some of the complaints do seem genuine. Take the case of consumer goods suppliers. Times of India has quoted LG Electronics India officials as saying that the company has decided not to deal with e-retailers at all. The report also quotes other company officials as saying that they will not offer service support for such sales as the deal with e-retailers was through unauthorised channel partners. Sony India officials are also quoted complaining about the huge discounts offered on website prices against those in stores. 
 
As for the traders and large brick-and-mortar retailers, they have very little grounds for complain. E-retailers are doing to these organised retailers what they did to the small kirana shopowners. Retailers are complaining of predatory pricing by Flipkart and accusing it of selling below cost. But the definition of cost is different for a trader as compared to that of a manufacturer.
 
But the reason their accusation might fall flat is because Flipkart is only providing a platform for sale. Pricing are decided either by the manufacturer or the agency that decides to sell on Flipkart. Business Standard has reported a Flipkart spokesperson as saying that “We are an e-marketplace, where sellers decide the price, and only they can change the prices in the system. They sell directly to buyers without stepping out of their workplace." There is precedence in a similar case of predatory pricing against Snapdeal where the government could not prove no wrongdoing as the e-retail company was only providing a platform.
 
In his pre-election speech Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing small traders had told them that they would have to accept presence of large retail chains and e-commerce companies. He had said that small traders must learn to build brands and go online, creating virtual malls to take on large and multinational retailers. But that was before Big Billion Day happened. Now even the big retailers are complaining.
 
If customer is really the king, then he should be served at the best pricing possible. It is the duty of the government to ensure that the customer is treated as a king rather than bat for middlemen and intermediaries in their name.
 

Latest IIP data not worrisome: Nirmala Sitha...August
(She said that had it not been…)
KOLKATA: The latest Index of Industrial Production data -- which logged in 5-month low growth rate for August -- was not worrisome as some other sectors were showing signs of expansion, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said today.
"The new government in the last few months has (taken) every possible measure to revive the confidence like ease of doing business and better regulations," Sitharaman told reporters here today.
She said that had it not been the case, global rating agencies like Standard & Poor's would not have given a stable outlook on India .
"There are definite signs of improvement. The automobile and some core sectors are doing well," the minister said, adding that the IIP data would have no impact on the second quarter of GDP growth.
Industrial production growth as measured by IIP slowed down to 5-month low of 0.4 per cent in August mainly due to contraction in manufacturing output and lower offtake of consumer goods.

Annabelle review: Streaming horrorAP/Warner Bros. Pictures A still from the movie Annabelle.
TOPICS
English cinema
Paranormal horror films have a certain formulaic quality to them, to the point where some cult classic scenes have become almost cinematic clichés. You know: doors slamming shut, machines that come alive at night, shadowy apparitions that creep up on you… They’re the low-hanging fruits of the scary movie genre, the fail-safe way of packing in jolts aplenty on the cheap, but they’re overused precisely because they work unfailingly in making your skin crawl.
It needs a gifted director to go beyond peddling such cheap thrills, as Roman Polanski did with Rosemary’s Baby or James Wan did with The Conjuring. Let’s just say straightaway that John R. Leonetti isn’t that director. Renowned rather more for his cinematography — he cranked the camera in, among other projects, The Conjuring (for which he won the Fright Meter Award) — Leonetti runs wildly amok in the orchard of these low-hanging fruits. If there’s a visual cliché within miles, you can be sure he’ll hunt it down, zoom in up-close (with a thousand violins screeching in the background!) — and milk it for all it’s worth.
And, yet, such is his mastery of the camerawork craft and the eerie lighting that virtually every frame in Annabelle has a creepy horror quality to it, and you can’t think beyond the immediacy of your palpitating heart and your racing pulse. Which is probably a good thing because the storyline skates on pretty thin ice.
Annabelle is positioned as a prequel to The Conjuring — to establish how the doll at the centre of the satanic drama acquired its demoniac qualities. Mia and John (their names are — nudge, wink — an unsubtle directorial hat-tip to Rosemary’s Baby’s lead characters Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) are a young Californian couple preparing for their baby’s coming. But the tranquility of their suburban life is disturbed by a neighbourhood crime that spills over into their home. That scene, in particular, is gripping, and sets the tone for the next 90 minutes.
Once it’s infused with evil, and particularly after the advent of the baby, the doll plays on Mia’s mind, as the devil force looks to harvest a soul. Along the way, Leonetti conjures up many pulsating sequences: I’ll admit unashamedly that the scene in the basement very nearly gave me a heart attack. He’s particularly good at setting the mood and heightening viewers’ expectations of impending horror, stretching that moment till your nerves are jangling (and then some more) — and delivering a thumping denouement.
Annabelle is an unabashed celebration of the cliché, and the performances by the lead actors may be as wooden as the doll at the centre of it all, but it’s guaranteed to scare you witless to the point where you won’t know or won’t care.
Genre: Paranormal horror
Cast: Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, Tony Amendola, Alfre Woodard
Storyline: A doll possessed by satanic spirits spooks a young family — and us
Bottomline: For all the horror-movie clichés, every frame scares you witless

InOpen Tech ties up with Tata ClassEdge for education servicesInOpen, Tata ClassEdge tie up for education programme
M Saraswathy | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 09:21 PM IST
InOpen Technologies, a start-up incubated at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay, is partnering Tata ClassEdge, a provider of technology-enabled educational solutions for schools. As part of the tie-up, Computer Masti, InOpen’s flagship computer science programme, will be offered across all 1,600 Tata ClassEdge schools.
InOpen focuses on developing quality academic content through research. The company was incorporated in October 2009 and incubated at IIT-Bombay’s Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Through its products, it caters to about 600,000 students across 350 schools. InOpen also works with the information technology literacy solutions of various government and corporate organisations.
Rupesh Kumar Shah, co-founder and chief executive of InOpen, said the company had received partnership proposals from major educational companies. He added the company had chosen Tata ClassEdge, as it had a good brand name and wide presence across schools. “Initially, we want to target a third of the schools and try to reach about 2,000 in the next three-four years, through this tie-up,” he said.
He added that InOpen will retain the majority portion of the revenue, while Tata ClassEdge will retain a portion of it. The branding of Computer Masti will also remain intact.Computer Masti consists of a graded text book, with the support of teacher training and assessments and is available for students in Class I to Class VIII. All programmes and content are presented in a narrative format through two child characters - Tejas and Jyoti. Colourful pictures, worksheets and interactive lessons are an inherent part of the textbook for each level.The lessons are based on free and open source software. The Computer Masti toolkit can be installed on commonly used operating systems.
Nirav Khmabati, chief executive of Tata ClassEdge, said both InOpen and Tata ClassEdge shared the same educational philosophy —teaching-learning should be active, participatory and skills-oriented.

Tasmanian author Richard Flanagan on the democratisation of the Booker and how he has become one of the reservoirs of rejected thoughts
“I don’t worry about tomorrow. Today is good enough for me,” says Richard Flanagan in as delicious an understatement as ever made. Today is not just good enough for Richard; it actually comes with the promise of great times – his book “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” has been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for Fiction 2014. And he stands, possibly a few hours away from the ultimate glory – the announcement of the final winner shall be made this Tuesday.
Not that he is losing much sleep over it. One of his earlier books, “Gould’s Book of Fish” was such a favourite of the bookies for the prize that they had stopped taking bets over it. The book, unfortunately, never got the coveted prize. Hence, possibly, Richard is underplaying his making the shortlist this time.
There could yet be another reason. “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” is set around the Burma Railway where many years ago his father had spent considerable time as an Australian prisoner of war. Young Richard would doubtlessly have heard many tales of deprivation and humiliation, some of which would have at a subconscious level made it to the novel. Unfortunately, his father passed away the day he wrapped the book.

Does it not make it more poignant for him? It possibly does, but Richard remains unflappable as ever. “It would if I won it.” It is in marked contrast to his reaction at making the shortlist earlier this year when he admitted to being “stunned” to hear the news of his book being in the running for the prize which has now been opened to authors of any nationality.
That we will know shortly, but how does Richard feel when his readers compliment him for penning a novel with intricate tapestries around a central character, Dorrigo Evans, a surgeon, who is both a good man and a bad one?
“A character without contradictions is a caricature. In the end, the central character — Dorrigo Evans — is me. And so too the Japanese commandant, Nakamura, and so too the murderous Korean guard, the Goanna. All are me, because within each of us lives the universe, and the universe is never one thing. Its harmony lives in its oppositions,” says Richard, keen to take a dispassionate look at the work.
The universe may never be one thing, but it is changing, now more ready than before to accommodate Australian writers.
In fact like with India in the none too distant past, there is a tremendous engagement with authors from Down Under. What could possibly have brought about this new attention?
Richard, who has often regarded the job of a writer as “largely a journey into humility”, underlines the role of literature in bringing about a change from the fringes.
“Who knows? But then literature has frequently been the edges speaking their truth to the power of the centre. Literature is celebrated in the great centres, but its home is so very often the street and back alley, the jail yard and the sweat shop, the provinces and backwaters, the slums and the gutters. And in those worlds, alien to many European and American readers, perhaps they discover their own rejected thoughts.”
Richard’s expression of people’s “rejected thoughts” has apparently found many takers across the world with the Press even hailing “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” as “a novel of extraordinary powers” and “a classic in the making”.
Come Tuesday, and the affable Tasmanian shall know if “The Narrow Road…” succeeds where “Gould’s Book of Fish” failed.
Yes today, as Richard says, is good enough.
Tomorrow, more appropriately, next week, could just be much better.

food and dining (general)
Delhi is a nice city to be in. As the Capital of India, it has an advantage over other metros. And I am not referring to boring details such as the fact it’s the seat of the Central government and so on. I mean that as the Capital, Delhi has all kind of food that you may not get in other cities.
We have our State bhawans, for instance. So you can happily get to eat some light pork curry in Nagaland House, or a nice mustard fish in Assam Bhawan. You can have a plate of spicy Chettinad chicken in Tamil Nadu House and the delicious dessert, chhena poda, in Orissa Bhawan.
But that’s not all. We now even have international cuisine in Delhi, thanks to embassies and their cultural centres. You get good Italian food at the Italian Centre, a few French dishes at a bistro at the French Centre and Korean food at the Korean Centre. And now, you can even get Ethiopian food – where else but at the Ethiopian Cultural Centre?
But first I have to tell you that to enter the Ethiopian Centre, you need to be a member. Becoming a member is not tough. Just log on to www.ethiopiancultural
centredelhi.com for more details. You have to pay Rs.2500 for membership and then you can dine there – and entertain three guests, if you wish to.
A friend who is a member invited us for a meal. He had eaten there and loved the food and wanted us to try out dishes that were delicious and otherwise difficult to get in the city.
The Cultural Centre is in Chanakyapuri (7/50 G Niti Marg, tel nos: 011-26473654, 9310806161 and 9811415235). Turn left at the roundabout after leaving the PM’s residence and Ashoka Hotel on your right. Before the next roundabout, you’ll see the Centre on your right.
It’s a beautiful place, with enough parking space outside and inside. To enter the café — called Blue Nile — you go through an open courtyard around a lovely tree with beautiful mobiles hanging from the branches. You cross this and enter the restaurant, which is airy and well-lit, and run by a group of efficient people. The glass top tables have a nice design – a collection of spices adorn the centre.
I looked at the menu and saw that it had an Indian section, and an Ethiopian section. I quickly closed the first, and focussed on the second. Our friend suggested that we try out a chicken dish that is considered the national dish of Ethiopia. So we asked for a plate of doro wat chicken cooked with chillies and in an onion sauce. And we ordered a plate of begg tibs (sliced fried mutton with garlic, onion and fresh chillies), fosolika bekarrot (prepared with green beans and carrot) and shiro wat, a mashed chickpea dish. And we ate all this with injera – soft fermented bread made with teff, a fine grain that you get in Ethiopia, though I am told that they prepare it with a mix of rice powder, barley and jawar at the Centre’s kitchen. And there was a bowl of berbere — red chillies and garlic — to spice up our food if we wanted it hot.
The food was Excellent – and I hope you noticed the capital E. The chicken came in a deliciously rich gravy, mildly sweet because of the onions, but wonderfully flavoured. The mutton had been lightly sautéed and went really well with the peppers and onions it came with. The veggie dish was nice, and the chickpea preparation was out of this world – thick and nicely aromatic. The prices are reasonable – the non-veg dishes cost Rs. 400 or so, and the vegetables around Rs. 200.
What enhanced the taste of every dish was the bread – the injera – which was simply superb. I mopped up the chicken gravy with it and raised a toast to the Ethiopians – beautiful people of an ancient civilization. I am glad they have opened the doors to their kitchen.

BJP  INLD only trying to grab power  won t keep promises: SoniaComments
Accusing Narendra Modi government of trying to weaken laws on land acquisition and rural employment brought in by UPA, Sonia Gandhi on Saturday asked people to be wary of BJP and INLD, claiming their sole aim was to "grab power for vested interests".
"Today, when polls are before us, our rival parties, in a bid to capture power, have come out of their houses and even out of the jails," she said addressing a rally in Tosham in this Harayna district ahead of October 15 Assembly election.
The Congress President said the electorate should not fall into the "trap" of the BJP which "promises a lot but delivers little". She also took a dig at INLD leader and former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, who was serving a 10-year imprisonment in a graft case but was campaigning while on bail on health grounds, for his remarks that if his party comes to power he will take oath from Tihar jail.
"Jail say sarkar chaleney walon ko bhe kursi chahiyee (Those promising to rule from jail only want power). Other parties too want their share of power. They want power not because they want to serve you and wish to undertake Haryana's development, they are in the race because they want to grab power for their vested interests," Gandhi said.
The Congress President attacked the Narendra Modi government's decision to decontrol prices of crucial drugs. Gandhi said the decision was taken ahead of the Prime Minister's visit to the United States.
"Prime Minister recently visited United States and only time will tell what was gained and what was lost....
"But one thing which he (Modi) did, what I think is very wrong, this will benefit American drug companies to big extent. As a result, cost of life saving drugs will go up and common man will have to suffer," she said referring to the lifting of control on drug prices.
She accused BJP of "promising moon" during run up to the Lok Sabha elections. "But now they want power for personal gain. Do not fall into the trap of their lies...during UPA's rule, we approved one rank one pension for ex servicemen...we do what we say," she said.
Gandhi said earlier land from farmers was taken away by industries without adequate compensation. But after the implementation of the Land Acquisition law, farmers are getting their due. She also said the rural employment guarantee law was another milestone of the UPA government.
"We implemented MNREGA. It has changed the lives of crores of families. It has especially benefited women from Dalit families and the weaker section. "But BJP government is preparing to weaken the law. This will be grave injustice to those who depend on it for their livelihood and are searching for jobs," she said. "They allege that Haryana has fallen behind in the past ten years, but you have yourself witnessed the progress made by the State during this period.
Chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda with the help of his colleagues and Congress workers has worked hard for the state's development and to make all sections happy," she said.

Glitzy, glamorous ISL promises new beginning for Indian soccer

Proclaimed a game-changer and perhaps the most star-studded event ever in the history of Indian football featuring retired giants of the game, the ISL will kick off in Kolkata on Sunday aiming to give a fresh lease of life to the global sport in a country which has been called a “sleeping giant” by FIFA.
Ranked 158th in the world, Indian football is not exactly in the pink of health but with a bit of help from former World Cup winners, some big Bollywood stars and a dash of cricket to it, the Indian Super League would be looking to draw the fans and raise the profile of the ‘beautiful game’ in a nation obsessed with cricket.
The tournament features five World Cup winners and Brazilian legend Zico, as coach, and that has been the one big factor in generating the buzz around the glitzy league.
All the marquee players are past their prime and are discards of European leagues -- David James of Kerala Blasters is the oldest at 44 -- but the event has generated worldwide attention.
Add to this the host of Bollywood celebrities, Indian cricketers -- including the iconic Sachin Tendulkar -- and business magnates who have co-owned various teams, and it appears to have all the ingredients needed for a blockbuster recipe.
There are, however, detractors who have questioned how the Indian footballers will benefit from the 10-week league which has a six-five foreigners-domestic ratio and whether the new teams will able to gain fan bases like the traditional powerhouses East Bengal, Mohun Bagan or the Goan and North-East clubs.
A grand Bollywood-style opening ceremony is planned ahead of the inaugural match-up between city franchise Atletico de Kolkata and Mumbai City FC. The league will then spread to seven other centers of Guwahati, Kochi, Fatorda, Pune, Chennai Mumbai and Delhi before the final on December 20.
On paper, the Ranbir Kapoor co-owned Mumbai City FC appear to be the heavyweights with the mercurial Frenchman Nicolas Anelka and Swede Fredrik Ljungberg along with acclaimed domestic players like India no 1 goalkeeper Subrata Pal, experienced side-back Syed Rahim Nabi and the spirited medio Lalrindika Ralte.
Mumbai City FC have some English flavour in the coaching staff with former Manchester City and Sunderland manager Peter Reid and his deputy Stee Darby, relatively known figure in domestic football.
But not always the right high profile players make a good team and this is where the stout Reid will chip in to make this a perfect unit.
Both Anelka, who was handed a five-match ban by the Football Association after the 35-year-old made the controversial ‘quenelle’ gesture in December while playing for West Bromwich Albion in the English Premier League, is set to miss the opening tie. Ljungberg will also be warming the benches as he is recovering from a calf-muscle injury.
The duo’s likely absence will give Atletico de Kolkata a definite advantage but only time would say how the side, with a distinctive Spanish flavour, would do.
In ex-Liverpool star Luis Garcia and La Liga journeymen Borja Fernez and Jofre Mateu and manager Antonio L Habas, who took charge of Bolivia and Valencia among others before coaching in South Africa, the team looks Spanish.
They would be playing alongside Indian players such as Sanju Pradhan, Arnab Mondal, Cavin Lobo Baljit Sahni and Cimax Lawrence.
ATK will have a rotation policy with four captains in the ranks -- Sanju being the only Indian in that quartet -- and it remains to be seen how they fare among the seven other franchises who have World Cup winning stars.
ATK is fresh from their month-long training in Spain which was organised by their La Liga partners Atletico Madrid and will look to gain fans in a city that’s known for their huge support to local clubs East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting.
Apart from Mumbai, FC Goa too is highly decorated with Arsenal and France luminary Robert Emmanuel Pires and Brazilian legend Zico, the most decorated marquee manager who has taken up the role after leaving Qatari side Al-Gharafa.
The 40-year-old Pires is best known for winning three FA Cups and two Premier League titles including the club’s unbeaten season of 2003-04.
The 40-year-old earned 79 caps between 1996 and 2004 for his country, including winning both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000.
Goa and North-East United FC of Guwahati are the only teams in the ISL to have avoided the domestic players draft and the two teams with huge fanbase would be the ones to watch out for.
While Goa had joined hands with former I-League champions Dempo SC, NEUFC took the support of Shillong Lajong FC to build their respective teams.
With the likes of promising Alwyn George, a two-time FPAI Young Player of the Year winner along with Cliford Miranda, Ranti Martins the proven performers in India, Goa FC look highly promising.
North-East United FC have 36-year-old Spanish World Cup winner in Joan Capdevilla as their marquee player. The left-back was part of their World Cup triumph in 2010 and they also have highly accomplished Greek goalkeeper Alexsandros Tzorvas, Zambian Africa Cup of Nations winner Isaac Chansa and will be managed by New Zealander Ricki Herbert.
Indian regulars Seminlen Doungel, Aiborlang Khongjee, Milan Singh, Boithang Haokip and local lad Durga Boro would look to give support to the well accomplished foreign roster.
With ardent football lover and Bollywood heartthrob John Abraham as the team owner, the Guwahati franchise will look to woo the crowd and take the sport to another level in the region.
Delhi Dynamos too are one of the most talked about franchise after their signing of Italian World Cup winner Alessandro Del Piero.
The 39-year-old former Italian captain was part of their triumphant campaign in 2006 and it was his third and last Cup appearance.
He is second in the Italian all-time top scorers (345 goals, and behind only Silvio Piola, 390 goals). Having played 19 years, and 11 years as captain, he holds the club records for goals (290) and appearances (705).
Like ATK Delhi have a link to a big European club -- Feyenoord, and they will have 33-year old Danish forward Mads Junker who is in top form along with compatriot Morten Skoubu and world’s tallest goalkeeper at six feet 10 inches Kristof Van Hout.
Among the Indian mix, Shylo Malsawmtluanga of Mizoram looks promising having played many I-League matches for East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Salgaocar.
FC Pune City have French World Cup winner David Trezeguet as their marquee signing. The 36-year-old, who was part of their 1998 triumph, is perhaps most famous for scoring the golden goal in the Euro 2000 final against Italy, which gave France a 2-1 win in extra time and missing his penalty in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final.
He is likely to be as prolific as he has ever been in a career that most recently took him to Argentina, where he grew up, for spells at River Plate and Newell’s Old Boys.
They will also have veteran Italian Bruno Cirillo and former Greece captain Kostas Katsouranis who will be the playmaker. Among Indians Dudu Omagbemi will look to gel well with the team.
Italian defender Marco Materazzi, who hit the headlines after being head-butted by Zinedine Zidane during the 2006 World Cup final, will be the fifth Cup winner in the ISL.
The 41-year-old Italian defender will don the role of marquee manager and will also be a player of Chennaiyin FC.
Chennai franchise have marquee player Elano Blumer and also have French star Mikael Silvestre, who has experience in Manchester United and Arsenal, and Bojan Djordjic. Among the Indians, the team features Abhijit Mondal, Shilton Paul, Balwant Singh among others.
At 44, David James, the marquee player of Kerala Blasters is the oldest in the league and will play a player-manager role like Materazzi.
The 6-feet, 4-inch tall goalkeeper is third on the list of all-time Premier League appearances, having played in 536 games at the top-level. James also holds the Premier League record for most clean sheets, 173. In 2010, at the age of 39, he became the oldest goalkeeper to appear in the FA Cup Final.
The team co-owned by Tendulkar appears to be weakest among all but will be the only team to have some distinctive Indian flavour.
Marquee signing Michael Chopra would have fitness concerns and seasoned Indian players like Mehtab Hossain, Nirmal Chhetri, Renedy Singh would be their high points in absence of any big foreigners name.
The team will also look up to Englishman Trevor James Morgan who is back after his successful East Bengal stint.
Among the top Indian names who would miss out from the ISL are captain Sunil Chhetri after I-League champions Bengaluru FC did not allow any of their players to participate in the event.
Salgaocar custodian Karanjit Singh, last year I-League’s second highest Indian goal-scorer Balwant Singh, Pune FC’s Japanese born Arata Izumi and BFC’s Robin Singh will also be missing in action.
Going by the team composition -- six compared to three plus one Asian quota in I-League -- it appears that the foreigners are all set to rule the roost in the ISL.

No special celebration on birthday: Amitabh ...No special celebration on birthday, says Amitabh Bachchan

MUMBAI: Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan , who brought in his 72nd birthday with family, does not have any special plans as he feels it is just another day for him.
Bachchan said though he does not give much importance to his birthday, he took blessings of his late father Harivansh Rai Bachchan .
"It is a very normal day, nothing special. I went to Prateeksha to take my father's blessings. I still feel they are still there. I do that every day before going for work. It is Karva Chauth today so all the women of the house are fasting, so at night we will have a simple dinner," Bachchan told reporter at his Janak office, while cutting a cake with them.
The icon said he could not fast for his actress-politician wife Jaya unlike previous years because of his health issues.
"I have to take medicine so doctor has advised me not to keep fast, hence I could not do it this time," said the actor , who was dressed in an orange Abu Sandip kurta.
Bachchan also took the opportunity to thank millions of his fans for their love and support.
"I did not have any goal or aim when I came to the industry. It is the love of all which had made me what I am today," he said.
Bachchan credited his parents' genes for his energetic nature.
"I think my energy is genetic," he said.

BASIC focuses on need to adapt to climate ch...Adaptation Fund
(BASIC comprising 4 economies-…)
NEW DELHI: With the increasing frequency of extreme climate events, efforts to adapt to climate change was high on the agenda of the BASIC meet in Sun City, South Africa. The quartet comprising the four emerging developing economies of Brazil, South Africa, India and China, emphasized that the need to focus on adapting to climate change was as important as reducing emissions.
"Adaptation needs are driven by the extent of adverse effects of climate change, experienced both now and in the future," the statement issued at the end of the two-day meeting of the BASIC in South Africa stated.
To this end, the four countries called on the industrialised countries to give "clearer" indications of their commitment to meeting the climate finance goal of $100 billion a year by 2020 and the initial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund. And that at the December negotiations in Lima under the aegies of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, the BASIC would push for to ensure adequate resource allocation to the Adaptation Fund and the adaptation window of the Green Climate Fund.
Ahead of the negotiations to be held in Bonn in late October, the BASIC made it clear that the developing countries would not allow for a lop-sided agreement at Paris, which focused more on efforts to reduce emission. The quartet stressed that the new global compact to be finalized at Paris in December 2015 must be balanced and include all the elements—the efforts to be made by each country or intended nationally determined contributions (INDC) must include mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building. In this context, the representatives of the four countries reiterated the need to focus on adaptation. "Adaptation is an issue which requires a global response and is as important as mitigation... National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) could be the basis for Parties' adaptation INDCs. Investment in adaptation by developing countries would represent an adaptation contribution," according to the BASIC statement.
In the drive to ensure that the 2015 global compact is balanced, the BASIC made it clear that the existing institutions and mechanisms created under the Convention should be used and further strengthened beyond 2020. "The elements of the 2015 agreement should strengthen and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of climate action. This will be done through provisions to strengthen institutional linkages between the adaptation committee and the Technology Executive Committee with the Standing Committee on Finance with the GCF and other operating entities of the Convention's Financial Mechanism."
Making the link between provision of climate finance by industrialised countries and the robustness of the global effort to counter climate change, the BASIC said that there had to be clarity on the manner in which developing countries will be supported in the implementation of their contributions under the 2015 agreement, given the serious socio-economic challenges they face and their urgent efforts to eradicate poverty. The 2015 agreement must establish a clear link between the actions by developing countries to contribute to effectively addressing the climate change challenge and the scale of finance, technology and capacity-building support required by them for implementation.
  The leaders and representatives of the four countries made it clear that the Lima round of negotiations to be held in December is an important milestone for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of the 2015 agreement. To this end, they stressed that the new global compact must not redefine or renegotiate the Convention, and must recognise the differentiation between developed and developing countries as reflected in the principle of common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities.
Industrialised countries have been pushing for a reworking of the 1992 firewall between developed and developing countries, arguing that the economic realities of the 1990s no longer hold true in 2014. The BASIC has been firm on this issue. This is the most contentious political issue that will need to be addressed at the Lima round, if countries are to finalise the new global compact in Paris next year.
Four countries reiterated their commitment to limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius and stressed that the 2015 agreement must provide an inclusive, equitable and effective framework within which countries can put forward their contributions. They also said that agreement should allow countries to progressively enhance their contributions, without providing for regression on existing commitments. India and China are not in favour of a review of the contributions that countries make towards the common goal of limiting temperature rise.

Many monitored by security services in Londo...Johnson's comments came as Scotland Yard continued to question five men arrested in the capital on Tuesday on suspicion of planning a terrorist act.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: Britain's security services are monitoring "thousands" of people in London, the city's mayor Boris Johnson said in an interview Saturday, amid heightened fears of attack by homegrown jihadists.
Johnson's comments came as Scotland Yard continued to question five men arrested in the capital on Tuesday on suspicion of planning a terrorist act.
"In London we're very, very vigilant and very, very concerned," Johnson told The Daily Telegraph.
"Every day - as you saw recently, we had to raise the threat level - every day the security services are involved in thousands of operations.
"There are probably in the low thousands of people that we are monitoring in London."
Britain's terrorism threat level was raised to "severe" in August, the second-highest, which means that an attack is thought to be "highly likely".
Intelligence services say the threat comes primarily from the Islamic State (IS) group and al-Qaeda.
On Friday, police across Britain were also warned by the top officer in charge of counter-terrorism, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley.
"The threat level to police officers and staff has been heightened, but we are used to confronting risk and danger, this is what we do on a daily basis, and we are well trained," he said.
The government believes that around 500 people have travelled from Britain and are fighting in Iraq and Syria.
Johnson said that of these, "we think a third, maybe more - maybe half - come from the London area".
"If and when they come back, we have a real job to deal with them," he told the Telegraph.
Ministers have promised a string of measures to crack down on young British Muslims travelling to Syria and Iraq, including stopping them at airports and preventing them from travelling and tightening measures which could restrict their movements.
"We must do everything we can to defeat this ideology and prevent the radicalisation of young British Muslims," Home Secretary Theresa May told the Conservative Party conference last month.
Two Britons, David Haines and Alan Henning, have been murdered by IS jihadists since September.
Britain has sent eight jets to join air strikes on IS group targets in Iraq but is not taking place in strikes on targets in Syria.

Modi stresses federalism in $100-bn opportunity callComments
Foreign investments worth $100 billion are knocking at the doors of India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, calling for stronger Centre-state relations to capitalise on the opportunity.

Modi, who was speaking at the Global Investors’ Summit in Indore, said foreign investors should not treat India merely as a market, but should focus on turning it into a manufacturing hub to increase the purchasing power of Indians.
"Investments worth $100 billion from abroad have applied for visa. Now it is the turn of the states to capitalise on the opportunity. The roads are wide open. The states which are ready can walk away with major share," Modi told a gathering of India’s top industrialists.
"When we talk about Make in India, then we want to create confidence in the world that there is a huge investment possibility in India. Please do not consider India only as a market... dump goods, sell them and make profits."
Modi called for greater cooperation between states and the Centre, saying the country's strength lies in its states and it cannot just rest on the Centre.
"India cannot grow without the support of other pillars. There cannot be a conflict between the states and the Centre. In fact, they have to complement each other if the country has to attain heights," he said.
"I want to work as Team India. All CMs and the PM should work together to take country ahead."
Madhya Pradesh is the country’s fastest growing state with some of its best infrastructure but private investment has not kept pace.
Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been following on the heels of states like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu to promote a pro-business climate in a bid to coax investment in Madhya Pradesh.
Modi said states can contribute in a big way in nation building by picking up the Centre's programmes and contributing to those in their own way.
He cited the example of Madhya Pradesh which has announced concessions for assimilation and production of defence products.
"Madhya Pradesh has taken a great step in making India self-sufficient in defence sector (in coming days)," he said.
Justifying his decision to allow 100% FDI in the railways, the PM said the sector alone could inject oxygen into India’s economy. He claimed that FDI in the railways has the mandate of all its employees.

Prime Minister Modi launched scheme to develop villages today

The scheme encourages MPs from both Houses to identify and develop one village from their constituencies
Taking forward his announcement during his address to the nation on August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday unveiled a blueprint for the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) on Jayaprakash Narayan’s birth anniversary.
The scheme encourages Members of Parliament from both Houses to identify and develop one village from their constituency as a model village by 2016, and two more by 2019, covering over 2,500 villages of the 6 lakh villages country-wide.
“This is not a rupiya-paisa yojana but a demand-driven, people’s participatory scheme. There are 800 parliamentarians and in three years, 2,500-odd villages could get covered. If States were to initiate their own similar schemes with MLAs, 6,000 to 7,000 villages could get covered. One good village can affect an entire area, and a viral effect could begin,” Mr. Modi said while unveiling SAGY for which no new funds have been allocated.
MPLAD funds to benefit model villages
The 65-page outline for the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday here, in the presence of Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari, requires MPs to identify one village with a population of 3,000-5,000 in the plains and 1,000-3,000 in the hills within a month for convergence of existing schemes for socio-economic development of the area.
MPs can choose any village except their own or their spouse’s. There is no other criterion.
MPs are expected to facilitate a village development plan, motivate villagers to take up activities and use the Rs.5-crore MPLAD fund to fill gaps for funds besides mobilising “additional resources especially from Corporate Social Responsibility” in sewage and water supply schemes.
The activities and outcomes will cover broad development indicators such as health, nutrition and education through organising immunization drives, improving mid-day meal schemes, improving Aadhaar enrolment, setting up “smart schools” with IT-enabled classrooms and e-libraries, improving panchayat infrastructure under schemes such as MNREGA and Backward Regions Grants Fund.
A series of measures speak of better implementation of existing and new schemes and laws including RTI Act, National Food Security Act, National Rural Livelihood Mission, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, while at the same time emphasising “activities to improve hygienic behaviour” by encouraging bathing among villagers, use of toilets and exercising for thirty minutes every day. It envisions social development in villages through identifying a village day, a village song, and focusing on alternative methods of dispute resolution.
There will be real-time web-based monitoring and a first review after five months by an independent agency. District Collectors will carry out a baseline surveys and then chair monthly review meetings to monitor progress. At the State-level, Chief Secretaries will lead an empowered committee on the same and the Minister for Rural Development and Secretary, Rural Development, will chair two national-level committees to track the scheme.
“This is not a small risk that I have taken by suggesting this. Instead of maximising the use of MPLAD funds over the largest possible area, this will instead require focusing the funds in a village. MPs will be able to identify the shortcomings in implementation of schemes,” said Mr. Modi.
Speaking at the event, Mr. Gadkari said: “SAGY aims at socio-economic transformation, not just making government funds and facilities available to villages. This will be a movement from swaraj to suraaj.” The aim would be to inculcate a sense of pride, volunteerism, and self-reliance in villages, he added.

RIL looking to sell US shale gas interest for $4.5 bnReliance Industries looking to sell US shale gas interest for $4.5 billion

(Reliance Industries is…)
NEW YORK: Reliance Industries is looking to sell its 45 per cent stake in the Eagle Ford basin shale oil and gas venture in the US for an estimated USD 4.5 billion.
RIL, which bought 45 per cent interest in Pioneer Natural Resources Co's Eagle Ford shale formation of south Texas for USD 1.3 billion, is working with Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to find a buyer, industry sources said.
When contacted, a company spokesperson said, "Reliance constantly strives to identify means by which to create additional value for its shareholders" but declined to comment on the specific sale.
"It is Reliance's policy not to comment on market speculation. If there are any required disclosures, Reliance will make them at the appropriate time," the spokesperson said.
Pioneer holds 46 per cent in the Eagle Ford venture while the remaining 9 per cent is with Alpha SAB's Newpeck LLC. Newpek too is exploring opportunities to sell its share and is being advised by Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
RIL is also selling its investment in EFS Midstream LLC , an oil and gas gathering treatment and transportation network, sources said.
EFS Midstream operates 11 central gathering plants in south Texas.
RIL, in a July presentation to investors, had stated that it has invested a total of USD 3.91 billion in Pioneer joint venture since inception. 472 wells have been drilled to date with average production rate of 676 million standard cubic feet per day.
The Eagle Ford assets spread over 230,000 acres have become more attractive after the US Commerce Department in June gave Pioneer permission to export a type of ultralight oil known as condensate produced from the region.
The approval will "help ease pressure on differentials, which has remained key challenge," RIL had stated in the presentation.
Besides Eagle Ford, RIL has two more shale ventures in US - 40 per cent stake in Chevron's Marcellus shale acreage and a 60 per cent interest in Carrizo Oil and Gas Inc's Marcellus shale acreage in Central and Northeast Pennsylvania.
According to RIL's July presentation, the company has till date invested USD 0.87 billion in the Carrizo joint venture and another USD 2.59 billion in the Chevron venture. Its total investment in US was USD 7.36 billion.

(Pak troops resorted to firing…)
JAMMU: After a brief lull, Pakistan today again violated the ceasefire by firing on forward posts along the LoC in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir , drawing retaliation from India.
Pakistani troops resorted to firing on forward Indian posts along LoC in Banwat sector of Poonch district from 1300 hours, a senior Army officer told PTI.
Indian troops guarding the border, took positions and retaliated resulting in exchanges which were going on when last reports came from the area, he said
There was no loss of life on our side, the officer said. The last instance of firing by Pakistan along the 192-km IB was when its Rangers targeted four BSF Border Out Posts (BoP) in Hiranagar sector of Kathua district for 20 minutes on Thursday night.
The IB has witnessed heavy firing from October 1-9 that has left eight persons dead and 90 people injured, including 13 securitymen.
Besides over 32,000 people have fled from their border homes leaving 113 hamlets deserted along the IB.
India and Pakistan troops traded heavy fire along the IB on the intervening night of October 7 and 8 after Pakistan Rangers shelled almost the entire IB by targeting 60 Border Out Posts (BoPs) and over 130 border hamlets in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts of Jammu and Kashmir, in which 15 people including 3 BSF jawans were injured.
There has been over three dozen ceasefire violations along the IB since October one.

Ebola joke  vomiting passenger spark scares in USEbola joke, vomiting passenger spark scares in US
AFP
New York, October 11, 2014
First Published: 18:01 IST(11/10/2014)
print
Jitters in the US over Ebola were underlined Friday after an air passenger's joke sparked a full-on alert, while another plane was quarantined at Las Vegas airport because someone vomited onboard.
In the joke incident, a Hazmat (hazardous materials) team in blue suits boarded a US Airways Flight from Philadelphia to the Dominican Republic on Wednesday.
A passenger was reported to have said: "Hey, I've got Ebola, you're screwed."
After the flight reached its destination, a member of the cabin crew requested all passengers sit down before the Hazmat squad arrived.
"It's going to look worse than it is," the attendant spoke over the intercom as she sought to calm nerves.
"I've done this for 36 years. I think the man that has said this is an idiot," she added.
Footage of the incident went viral on the Internet, and was viewed nearly 3.3 million times by late afternoon Friday since it was uploaded to YouTube.
The male passenger could be overheard on the video telling the Hazmat team, "I was just kidding" and "I ain't from Africa," as he was escorted off the aircraft.
A US Airways spokeswoman told AFP that the incident delayed disembarkation of the aircraft. Airline officials were unable to estimate how much money the episode may have cost.
Meanwhile in Las Vegas on Friday, a Delta plane from New York was quarantined at the arrivals gate after a passenger who had reportedly traveled to Africa vomited onboard.
At least one passenger live tweeted the incident, which was initially reported to involve two passengers being taken off because of suspected contact with people infected with the deadly Ebola virus.
Doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and the Southern Nevada Health District joined firefighters to test the passenger while all of the other passengers remained on board.
"After a thorough assessment, it has been determined that the affected passenger does not meet the criteria for Ebola," said a statement from McCarran International Airport.
The first death from Ebola on US soil in Texas on Wednesday fanned concern in the United States where major cities are ramping up efforts to prevent an American outbreak of the disease.
Five US international airports are to start new screening measures of passengers arriving from West Africa, beginning with JFK in New York on Saturday.

Forex kitty slips for 5th week in a row  plunges $2.75 billion: RBIForex kitty slips for 5th week in a row, plunges $2.75 billion: RBI
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Oct 10, 2014 11:48 PM IST
Continuing its downward trend for the fifth consecutive week, the foreign exchange reserves plunged $2.754 billion to $311.427 billion in the week to October 3, led by a major fall in non-US currency assets, according to data released by the RBI on Friday.
In the week to September 26, reserves went down $1.415 billion to $314.181 billion. In the week to July 25, 2014, the reserves had touched $320.56 billion, just short of the life-time high of $320.79 billion on September 2, 2011.
In the reporting week, foreign currency assets, a major constituent of overall reserves, decreased $1.803 billion to $285.588 billion, RBI said.
Foreign currency assets, expressed in dollar terms, include the effect of appreciation and depreciation of non-US currencies such as the euro, pound and yen held in reserves.
After remaining unchanged for a couple of weeks, the country's gold reserves dropped by $919.7 million to $20.013 billion.
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) were down $22.8 million to $4.284 billion, while the country's reserve position with the IMF dipped by $8.2 million to $1.540 billion during the week, the RBI data showed.

PM Modi exhorts MPs to adopt a village eachPM Modi exhorts MPs to adopt a village each
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Ne Delhi, October 11, 2014
First Published: 12:22 IST(11/10/2014) | Last Updated: 01:17 IST(12/10/2014)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched a rural development scheme under which each member of parliament will adopt three villages by 2019 to improve the standard of living and quality of life of millions of people in the countryside.
The government hopes the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojna (SAGY) will have a cascade effect on surrounding villages and lift physical and institutional infrastructure across rural India, where basic facilities are often patchy.
“We are nearly 800 MPs. If before 2019 we develop three villages each, we reach nearly 2,500 villages. If in the light of this scheme, the states also create a similar scheme for MLAs, then 6,000-7,000 more villages can be added,” Modi told MPs.
Under the programme, each MP will take responsibility for three villages and turn them into a “model village” by 2019 through the convergence of different government schemes and their effective implementation.
Watch: Modi to adopt a village in Varanasi, urges MPs to follow suit
Modi asked parliamentarians to act as a catalyst for development in villages, saying the programme will help them identify bottlenecks and enable them to iron out these bottlenecks.
“Whether you get votes from the village or not whether the village community supports you or not, you will have to work for the village and its community and act as a facilitator, as a catalyst for its change,” he said.
The scheme was launched on the birth anniversary of socialist icon Jai Prakash Narayan, just days after the government kicked off its Clean India campaign on Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary.
Quoting Jayaprakash Narayan, Modi said while politics and democracy cannot be separated, the new scheme will open the door for constructive politics in the country.
Modi said it was not a money-driven scheme but aimed at the overall development of rural India.
“The talk about bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom will continue in the academic world,” he said. “We want to work. We want to see whether we can bring change through public participation.
 I am not claiming that I will change the situation all of a sudden … This scheme is not the ultimate. Changes and improvement will come with the passage of time.”

History, battleground for politics

Subramanian Swamy’s call for burning books written by Nehruvian historians is part of a larger conspiracy to underplay the contributions made by Nehru
The recent statement made by Subramanian Swamy calling for the burning of books written by Nehruvian historians is part of a larger conspiracy by the Sangh Parivar to underplay the contribution of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in India’s history. It has been a while since the Sangh began attempts to rewrite India’s history and now they feel they have a good opportunity to accomplish this since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won a clear majority in the Lok Sabha election. The provocative statements made by Mr. Swamy — who has been owned, disowned and re-owned by the Sangh — are only a step towards reclaiming historical narratives to suit the right-wing group’s political agenda. Mr. Swamy’s statements, which are usually worth ignoring, cannot perhaps be overlooked for this reason.
Pandit Nehru’s contribution to the freedom struggle under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and his vision for the country’s development is something which India can never forget. He was Gandhi’s chosen one in order to lead the nation after independence. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently made a statement asking people to go on a cleanliness drive from November 14, the birth anniversary of Pandit Nehru to Indira Gandhi’s birth anniversary, November 19. This is probably the first time Mr. Modi has acknowledged the existence of the two great former Prime Ministers.
The problem with the RSS-BJP combine and their followers is that they don’t have any names worth mentioning among their leaders who might have contributed to the freedom struggle. That is probably the reason why they have been trying to appropriate the legacy of Gandhi, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Sardar Patel among others. During the 1980s, the BJP under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee initiated the process of appropriating the doctrine of Gandhian socialism. The idea was to try and establish some relationship between their party and the freedom movement. This attempt, however, did not offer them any political advantage. As a result they reverted to hardcore religious fundamentalism and pursued the provocatively divisive issue of building a Ram temple in Ayodhya after the demolition of the Babri Masjid as their core political agenda. Later they tried to appropriate Patel as their leader and the Sangh Parivar propagated stories about the differences between Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel.
In the run-up to the general election Mr. Modi constantly made references to building the iron statue of Sardar Patel. He even appealed to contribute iron in the same way that they sought contributions of bricks for constructing the Ram Mandir. But now that he is the Prime Minister of the country, we have not heard much about the massive “Loh” statue of “Loh Purush” Sardar Patel.
Modi, the statesman
After coming to power, Mr. Modi is trying hard to distance himself from the hardcore religious and fundamentalist ideology in which he had been trained and associated with since the beginning. In his attempt to project himself as a statesman, he has been making statements in favour of Indian Muslims and also appealed from the Red Fort for communal harmony in the country.
But can a leopard conceal its spots?
The game plan of the RSS-BJP combine to achieve a “Congress Mukt Bharat” is to capture the central space in national politics presently occupied by the Congress. At the same time marginal players like Mr. Swamy who are part of the RSS-BJP fraternity are being allowed to rake up their divisive agenda. Those who have been accused of indulging in communal riots are being honoured by the current dispensation. Provocative statements are allowed to be made by the cadre of right-wing groups.
Every small incident of tensions between local communities is being blown out of proportion and given a communal colour. The strategy of the RSS-BJP combine is to demolish the contributions made by the Nehru-Gandhi family during the freedom movement and building a new India post-independence. Their agenda is clearly to further polarise politics.
But several important questions need to be raised at this point. Would the saner elements in Indian society allow this to happen? Would we remain silent spectators while the RSS-BJP combine distorts Indian history? The thing to watch for is how Mr. Modi will tackle people like Mr. Swamy, Yogi Adityanath and other fringe elements within the RSS-BJP fraternity in order to emerge as a true national leader. Or would he surreptitiously allow these players to further polarise politics?

A right mix of Indian and foreign talent
N. Sudarshan

TOPICS
soccer
For every team in the Indian Super League (ISL), the challenge will be to make the whole seem greater than the sum of its parts. Chennaiyin FC has to do this in double quick time. It has looked perennially a step or two behind the rest, for it was conceived only at the last minute following the withdrawal of the Bangalore franchise.
From the signing of the marquee player to the identification of the training ground, it has had to play catch-up. Now that things have more or less fallen into place it’s time for the focus to shift to the pitch.
Any city-based league, like the Indian Premier League, with a mix of Indian and foreign nationals, attracts the first set of eyeballs mainly on virtue of its overseas talent. In this respect the team will be identified by Bernard Mendy, formerly Paris Saint-Germain, Cristian Hidalgo Gonzalez, a product of the famed Barcelona academy La Masia, Bojan Djordjic, former Manchester United youth player, Mikael Silvestre, formerly Manchester United and marquee signing Elano Blumer.
But as any IPL side found out in subsequent years, it’s the strength of its Indian contingent that tilts the balance. Here, East Bengal skipper and mid-fielder Harmanjot Singh Khabra, Mohun Bagan captain and goal keeper Shilton Paul, former Churchill Brothers forward and 2014 FPAI Indian player of the year Balwant Singh, and the highly rated 23-year-old striker Jeje Lalpekhlua have to come good.
However, the trump card for Chennaiyin FC might well be Elano, the 33-year-old Brazilian who is the youngest among all marquee players. So far he hasn’t garnered as much interest as the likes of Alessandro Del Piero, Robert Pires et al have done. But come match day he might well outdo everybody.
As with other sides, formation-wise, not much is known as all training sessions have been under closed doors. On paper, a classic 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1 with one striker in a withdrawn role looks possible. But a 3-5-2 shape was used in the last of its practise games. Age and coaching philosophies might also mean that players’ might be shifted out of their comfort zones.
However, with former Inter Milan defender Marco Materazzi at the helm, an Italian imprint with emphasis on defensive organisation and tactical acumen is a given. But as Elano told The Hindu they will also have to attack and score goals. Getting this concoction right will be the key.
The team:
Goalkeepers: Abhijit Mondal, Shilton Paul, Gennaro Bracigliano
Defenders: Gouramangi Singh, Dhanachandra Singh, Khelemba Meetei, Abhishek Das, Bernard Mendy, Jairo Suarez, Marco Materazzi, Mikael Silvestre
Midfielders: Harmanjot Singh Khabra, Denson Devadas, Dane Pereira, NP Pradeep, Jaison Vales, Anthony Barbosa, Sukhwinder Singh, Cristian Hidalgo, Bojan Djordjic, Bruno Pelissari, Pierre Tillman, Elano Blumer.
Forwards: Jeje Lalpekhlua, Jayesh Rane, Balwant Singh, Eduardo Silva Lerma, John Stiven Mendoza.
Head Coach: Marco Materazzi
Owners: Vita Dani, Abhishek Bachchan and M.S. Dhoni
Marquee Player: Elano Blumer
Watch out for:
Balwant Singh will in all probability lead the attack. With 17 goals for Churchill Brothers in all competitions, 2014 has been his breakout year. Currently with Mohun Bagan, the ace forward would like to be as prolific in the ISL.
Cristian Hidalgo Gonzalez, a product of Barcelona’s youth set-up, is expected to be a first-team regular. Adept as a winger and as a withdrawn striker, the 31-year-old Spaniard also has the experience of having played for Deportivo La Coruna.

Nobel prize will be a turning point for child rights: Satyarthiaccomplishment
Winning the Nobel Peace Prize for 2014 came as a surprise to Kailash Satyarthi even though he had been nominated for the honour in 2006 as well. That year the award went to Mohammad Yunus and Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.
As the architect of the Global March Against Child Labour and Global Campaign for Education, Mr. Satyarthi, who has worked in 144 countries, says that “every child in each country is dear to him.” He believes the award will be a “turning point” in the struggle for the rights of children. There are 16.5 crore child labourers in the world of which 6.5 crore are in India.
Speaking of the prize, he said: “It must be read between the lines not only by the governments but by the peoples of both countries. Not having peace is a curse for children. They should be born in peace, live in peace and should enjoy their childhood and freedom of education in peace. We cannot ignore the fundamental principle of peace,” he said.
For him personally the sight of a cobbler’s son working outside his school in Vidhisha in Madhya Pradesh tugged at his heart. “I was unable to digest why some children were born to work and some were born to go to school.’’
After abandoning his job as an electrical engineer and working with some NGOs, in 1980 he founded the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the Children Movement) which is focused on ending bonded labour, child labour and trafficking. The organisation is credited with rescuing over 80,000 children from bondage, trafficking and exploitative labour since it came into existence.
Mr. Satyarthi was part of the movement to make education a constitutional provision which paved the way for the right of children for free and compulsory education in 2009. He is a member of the high-level group formed by UNESCO on Education for All on which select presidents, Prime Ministers and UN agency heads are represented.
Among the first to congratulate Mr. Satyarthi on Friday on winning the Nobel Prize was former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown who is also a member of a high-level panel on education.
He is also credited with bringing about Rugmark (now known as Good Weave) in 1994 which is a certification and social labeling for child labour-free carpets in South Asia. Since then he has been involved in promoting corporate social responsibility initiatives in the garment manufacturing, mica mining, cocoa farming and sporting goods sector.

RBI s final guidelines on small and payments banks in a month : S S MundraRBI rules on payment banks in a month, says S S Mundra
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 09:11 PM IST
Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor S S Mundra on Saturday said the final guidelines on small and payments banks were expected in a month.
"We have received comments (on discussion paper)," he said, while addressing students from the NMIMS in Mumbai.
RBI had come out with draft guidelines on the differentiated banks in July this year and had asked for comments on the same by August 28.
Concerns have been raised on the financial viability of these banks as the profitability of the business will depend on volumes as spreads are likely to be wafer-thin.
However, Mundra dismissed the concerns on the profitability for such bank.
He said that the banks can earn from a variety of avenues like charging for transactions and through investments in government bonds, which is allowed.
The banking regulator has allowed telecom companies, retailers, pre-paid issuers (PPI), non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), real estate cooperatives and public sector entities to apply for payment banks.

(Over a lakh of people…)
HYDERABAD: It was exactly a year ago that Cyclone Phailin, comparable to the magnitude of Cyclone Hudhud , hit the north coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh leaving two dead and heavy loss of crops.
Over a lakh of people were evacuated from Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh prior to Cyclone Phailin.
Though it was initially expected that Cyclone Phailin would hit the coast at Srikakulam, it changed its course and hit Odisha triggering heavy rains and floods which marooned some parts of coastal districts of that state.
More than 2.5 lakh people were reportedly marooned in Odisha as a result of heavy rains and floods due to Cyclone Phailin which claimed the lives of 30 people in various rain-related incidents.
According to a senior official of the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services ( INCOIS ), data of the past 100 years shows formation of depressions in Bay of Bengal during October-November which moving towards the north and northwest direction, hitting coastal parts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.
"The cyclone normally occurs after the northeast monsoon is over in India. If the depression occurs during November it is most likely to hit the Bangladesh coast. If it happens during the October-November period it is most likely to hit the coasts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha," the official told PTI.
Over a lakh of people from low-lying areas of coastal districts in Andhra Pradesh have been evacuated after the state intensified preparations to face Cyclone Hudhud, which is expected to reach the northern coastline around Visakhapatnam by forenoon tomorrow.

Amin Pathak has been elected as the new RCA president.
RCA comprises 33 district associations. Twenty-three out of these today called a meeting at a hotel in Jaipur and decided to remove the four officials from their positions in RCA. Amin Pathak said, "After Lalit Modi was elected the president, cricketing activities in the state had come to a standstill. Therefore, we decided to meet and bring a no-confidence motion against him."

The meeting removed deputy president Mehmood M Abdi, secretary Somendra Tiwari and treasurer Pawan Goyal, apart from the president Modi.

Soon, the BCCI suspended RCA from its membership pending disciplinary proceedings against Modi on charges of misconduct.

Israeli swimmers battle plastic bags to take open water recordIsraeli swimmers battle plastic bags to take open water record
AFP
Herzliya, Israel, October 11, 2014
First Published: 20:53 IST(11/10/2014)

Six Israelis on Saturday claimed the world open water relay record after swimming 380 kilometres (236 miles) home from Cyprus in a challenge also meant to highlight ocean pollution.
One of the obstacles they faced while swimming from the Mediterranean island to the Israeli coast was the proliferation of floating plastic bags.

The men, aged 42 to 66, had left at noon Sunday from the Cypriot resort town of Paphos, accompanied by a support vessel also equipped to document their feat for a crack at the Guinness Book of World Records.
Their eyes were set on a 366-kilometre record held by Americans, swimmer Oded Rahav told journalists in Herzliya.
Swimming day and night in one-hour relays, with one team-mate watching at any given time and the others resting, they arrived in Rishon LeTsion late Friday.

The men had made a previous attempt on the record last year, but a storm forced them to abandon it midway.
This time, aside from jellyfish, curious dolphins and water temperatures a bit chilly for only swimming trunks, the main obstacle was a plague of plastic bags.
"To swim through plastic bags is humiliating and intolerable," one of them said. "The sea should be a sanctuary for all and conserved for all."

Capital goods sector to see modest revenue growth  better margins in Q2Capital goods sector to see modest revenue growth, better margins in Q2
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 09:26 PM IST
Capital goods companies are expected to report modest revenue growth but will see margin improvement in the September-end quarter, according to sector analysts.
While in the early part of the year the BSE capital goods index outperformed the Sensex, the sectoral stocks have corrected in the last three months in view of outlook of gradual economic recovery. In the first quarter, capital goods companies reported drop in sales but profit margins improved due to cost savings. Analysts believe that second quarter too will see muted revenue growth but margins will rise over the corresponding period last year.
Companies, including ABB, Crompton Greaves and Larsen & Toubro could see a rise in their margins. ABB is likely to benefit from fall in metal prices, while Larsen & Toubro results will report better margins, as Q2 FY 2014 result was impacted by Forex loss and higher other expenditure.  
While business sentiment has improved and grounded infra projects are back on track, the revenue growth of capital goods companies is likely to remain suppressed owing to weak order book and softer execution.
“With fewer orders and rising competition, the focus of capital goods companies has turned to cost optimisation and higher indigenisation measures to protect trough-level margins. Consequently, we expect our capital goods coverage universe to register a 80 basis points YoY increase in operating margin at six per cent,” Nirmal Bang Equity said in its results preview note.
Brokerages expect Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd to report 12-16 percent decline in revenue due to shrinking order book and customer centric delays. Siemens sales growth is expected to contract due to execution delays.
Elara Capital expects aggregate level sales growth of 3 percent in six companies in the sector (ABB, Crompton Greaves, Cummins, Siemens, Thermax and Voltas) compared to second quarter of FY 2014.

World Bank keen on funding AP Buddhist circu...Andhra Pradesh
(Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu…)
HYDERABAD: Making tourism one of its key focus areas in its services sector mission, Andhra Pradesh government said here today that the World Bank is keen on funding the state's 'Buddhist circuit'.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said that proposals to develop tourist circuits would be invited and the process would be made transparent.
At a meeting with tourism officials at the Secretariat, he directed them to come up with suggestions to attract more international tourists by establishing more attractions and promote religious, eco-tourism and beach tourism.
He asked officials to promote heritage sites in the state, adding that focus should be on promoting local arts and handicrafts like Kondapalli Bommalu, Etikoppaka and Narsapuram laces.
Given the popularity of food from Andhra Pradesh, he said that it must be promoted in a big way through food festivals.
He said that Kuchipudi dance could be promoted on global and local platforms by incorporating it in every programme.
He said that the government is looking at establishing a tourism university on the lines of those in Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland, with world-class facilities, offering a gamut of courses.
The Chief Minister also directed officials to explore opportunities in partnering with various international tourism agencies to promote cross-border cultural exchange and tourism.
In another development, he directed the AP health department to link Aaadhar with smart cards for pregnant women in the state.
Smart cards would have details like pregnant women's hospital admission, their nutrition and medicinal course for treatment, to ensure that government scheme's benefits reach pregnant women and their infants.
He said that women could be given suggestions and precautions during pregnancy through advertisements by getting celebrities to communicate the message.

InOpen  Tata ClassEdge tie up for education programmeInOpen, Tata ClassEdge tie up for education programme
M Saraswathy | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 09:21 PM IST
InOpen Technologies, a start-up incubated at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay, is partnering Tata ClassEdge, a provider of technology-enabled educational solutions for schools. As part of the tie-up, Computer Masti, InOpen’s flagship computer science programme, will be offered across all 1,600 Tata ClassEdge schools.
InOpen focuses on developing quality academic content through research. The company was incorporated in October 2009 and incubated at IIT-Bombay’s Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Through its products, it caters to about 600,000 students across 350 schools. InOpen also works with the information technology literacy solutions of various government and corporate organisations.
Rupesh Kumar Shah, co-founder and chief executive of InOpen, said the company had received partnership proposals from major educational companies. He added the company had chosen Tata ClassEdge, as it had a good brand name and wide presence across schools. “Initially, we want to target a third of the schools and try to reach about 2,000 in the next three-four years, through this tie-up,” he said.
He added that InOpen will retain the majority portion of the revenue, while Tata ClassEdge will retain a portion of it. The branding of Computer Masti will also remain intact.Computer Masti consists of a graded text book, with the support of teacher training and assessments and is available for students in Class I to Class VIII. All programmes and content are presented in a narrative format through two child characters - Tejas and Jyoti. Colourful pictures, worksheets and interactive lessons are an inherent part of the textbook for each level.The lessons are based on free and open source software. The Computer Masti toolkit can be installed on commonly used operating systems.
Nirav Khmabati, chief executive of Tata ClassEdge, said both InOpen and Tata ClassEdge shared the same educational philosophy —teaching-learning should be active, participatory and skills-oriented.

Kohli and Raina helped India recover.India 263 for 7 (Kohli 62, Raina 62, Dhoni 51*, Taylor 3-54) beat West Indies 215 (Smith 97, Pollard 40, Shami 4-36, Jadeja 3-44) by 48 runs
Scorecard and ball-by-ball details
Chasing 264, West Indies were coasting. Dwayne Smith had gone past his highest ODI score, and his second-wicket partnership with Kieron Pollard was assuming threatening proportions. With nine wickets in hand, a long list of batsmen waiting in the dressing room, and 128 required at exactly a run a ball, this was West Indies' match to lose. They went and lost it.
It started with the wicket of Pollard, who chased a wide ball and dragged Amit Mishra onto his stumps. From that point, West Indies imploded. On a two-paced Feroz Shah Kotla pitch, India's bowlers put the brakes on the scoring, and panic took hold of the batsmen. West Indies lost their last nine wickets for 79 runs, and their last eight for 45.
In ODI cricket, six an over is usually a doddle when you have wickets in hand and not too many runs left to get. On this pitch, however, scoring quickly wasn't easy unless you had your eye in. India had discovered this to their detriment earlier in the day, both at the start and the end of their innings.
Having opted to bat first, they had struggled to break the shackles against accurate new-ball bowling from Ravi Rampaul and, in particular, Jerome Taylor , who attacked a good-length area close to off stump and allowed the pitch to do the rest. The second-wicket pair of Ajinkya Rahane and Ambati Rayudu had looked quite ill at ease while adding 46 in 67 balls, and even Virat Kohli had taken his time to find his feet.
Suresh Raina looked fluent right from the time he walked in, however, and his front-foot stride - the surest sign that his mind isn't entirely consumed by thoughts of the short ball - was light and sure whenever the bowlers gave him half an opportunity to drive through the off side.
Raina and Kohli slowly got on top of the bowling, and began the batting Powerplay on the cusp of India's first century stand for the fourth wicket since August 2012, and the score read 163 for 3.
It looked like a launchpad to a 280-plus score, but the dismissals of Raina and Kohli, in the 37th and 41st overs, sucked the momentum out of India's innings. Without MS Dhoni's unbeaten 40-ball 51, it's unlikely India would have gotten near their total of 263, with pretty much everyone else at the other end struggling to come to terms with the surface and West Indies' adroit use of the slower ball at the death.
The wicket of Pollard caused a similar, and even more dramatic, turnaround in the tempo of West Indies' innings. Till then, Mishra had endured a frustrating evening. He had bowled a number of good balls, had had a close lbw shout against Pollard turned down, and had been picked off for three massive sixes, two of them by Pollard, and not necessarily off the middle of his bat. Having just struck his third six, he went after one tossed up wide outside off and inside-edged it onto leg stump.
Following that breakthrough, Mishra bowled 16 successive dot balls, landing everything on a good length on off stump, getting some balls to grip on the pitch and others to skid off the surface, and completely confounded Marlon Samuels , who had scored a century against this same attack three days ago.
Smith carried on fluently at the other end, picking off Kohli's wrong-footed legcutters for four fours in two overs, and launched Mohammed Shami over the long-on boundary in the first over of the batting Powerplay. In sight of his first century in ODIs and List A cricket, however, Smith received the perfect riposte from Shami, a full, fast ball that swung in a touch and cannoned off the pads and into the stumps.
The required rate crept up to over seven, and Samuels slapped a perfectly slappable long-hop from Umesh Yadav straight to cover. The spinners then discovered the turn available on the pitch, Mishra spinning one sharply to find Denesh Ramdin 's outside edge, Ravindra Jadeja doing the same to beat Andre Russell 's edge and have him brilliantly stumped by Dhoni. By this point, West Indies had been knocked out - the four wickets that remained fell in the space of 26 balls, and India won with 21 balls left to play.

GIF launched  to help India bridge infra deficitUpdated: October 10, 2014 08:16 IST
GIF launched, to help India bridge infra deficit
Puja Mehra
economy, business and finance
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, while launching the Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) here on Thursday, said the potential economic impact of the Ebola epidemic could be as high as $32.6 billion, if not quickly contained.
The GIF is aimed at mobilising the private sector to help tackle the massive infrastructure deficit now facing developing countries and emerging markets such as India. The World Bank estimates that these countries need $1 trillion a year in extra investments through 2020 and with public purses stretched, it is significant that the heads of some of the world’s leading institutional investors such as insurance and pension funds will be signing up as partners in the GIF.
Deep-pocketed institutional investors have $80 trillion in assets but less than a percentage of pension funds are allocated directly to infrastructure projects and the bulk of that is in advanced countries, Dr. Jim said.
He said the GIF would address the challenge of finding “bankable projects” as investible resources were available with the private sector. This was in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the World Bank’s technical support for the country’s infrastructure augmentation plans that he had raised in his meeting with Dr. Jim recently, the President said.
He was addressing a press conference here on Thursday at the onset of the World Bank Group’s annual meetings.
Dr. Jim cautioned against the “spill-over” effects to the rest of the global economy that could arise from the “aversion behaviour” the epidemic could trigger as had happened in the case of the SARS impact. “The price tag of the global economic impact goes up every day of delayed response … already airline stocks are feeling the impact of the cases of Ebola-related deaths of Spanish health workers,” Dr. Jim said.
The two-year regional financial impact of the epidemic could reach $32.6 billion by 2015-end, Dr. Kim said adding that it would be catastrophic for people throughout the West Africa region.
“I’ve just come from a high-level meeting on the Ebola crisis response … We heard from the presidents of the three most affected countries — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — and the challenges that each faces … over the past month, the international community has stepped up the global response but there is no doubt we are still way behind the curve, and that we have to quickly speed up, and scale up, the global response to this crisis,” Dr. Jim said.

Amazon plans to open its first full-fledged store across from the Empire State Building, at 7 West 34th Street, “The Wall Street Journal” reported.
Amazon.com, the online juggernaut whose rapid expansion helped derail many a brick-and-mortar retail chain, may soon open its first physical store, at a prime site in Midtown Manhattan, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Amazon plans to open its first full-fledged store across from the Empire State Building, at 7 West 34th Street, the Journal reported. The area, which is also near Macy's flagship store, is one of the city's most heavily trafficked zones.
The site will double as a mini-warehouse to support same-day delivery, returns and order pickups within New York, the Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. The store, which is expected to open in time for the holiday shopping season, may also display Amazon's proprietary products, such as its Kindle line of e-readers and tablets, Fire smartphones and video-streaming boxes. If the store takes off, Amazon may expand to other cities, the Journal reported.
Amazon declined to comment on the Journal’s report.
A store would mark a significant move for an online retailer that has capitalised on its Internet business model and the cost-savings of doing away with a vast physical network.
In recent years however, Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has led a number of initiatives that have mandated a physical presence in cities: lockers that temporarily hold customer purchases, for example, and a rapid expansion of grocery and same-day delivery that has often meant maintaining some sort of local distribution centre.
The company has also on occasion set up pop-up stores in malls, though those have been rare.

Air India to increase fuel hedgingAir India to increase fuel hedging
Aneesh Phadnis | Mumbai Oct 13, 2014 12:40 AM IST
Air India (AI) will step up fuel-hedging against volatility in crude oil prices. Globally, these have fallen below $90 a barrel and it is expected the scenario will be bearish for the next few months.
“We plan to hedge about 100,000 barrels a month of our next year’s requirement,” said an AI spokesperson, adding, “Our hedging quantity is small.”
The airline began fuel-hedging in 2002, but discontinued it within a few years. Last year, the airline’s board approved hedging about 500,000 barrels of jet fuel every quarter, about 20 per cent of its total consumption. But in 2013-14, it hedged only 70,000 barrels.
The AI management has been cautious on hedging. Globally, airlines hedge 50-60 per cent of their fuel requirements. According to a Reuters report, Australian airline Qantas hedged 94 per cent of its requirement in the first half of this year. The report added many airlines were locking in contracts for as far ahead as 2015 and 2016. It said Thai Airways hedges 63 per cent of its fuel needs, against 53 per cent earlier. Daily, AI lifts about 5,100 kilolitres of aviation turbine fuel and about 70 per cent of this is purchased in India. A rise in crude oil prices, as well as the rupee’s depreciation, had led to an increase in fuel bills. An increase in capacity and addition of new long-haul flights to Australia, Moscow and Rome-Milan contributed to the rise.
“We have initiated various steps and have been able to save fuel, following implementation of IATA (International Air Transport Association)’s fuel efficiency gap analysis. The measures included carrying lighter cutlery, less water and fewer magazines on board and implementing fuel-efficient procedures during the landing and taxi stages,” the spokesperson said.

LAL plans to manufacture shuttleless looms

The company is looking at collaboration with an overseas machinery manufacturer for manufacturing shuttleless loom.
TOPICS
City-based Lakshmi Automatic Loom Works (LAL) plans to manufacture shuttleless looms at its Pollachi plant, and is looking at collaboration with an overseas machinery manufacturer for the same.
Lower demand
Company Chief Executive Officer A. Doraiswamy told The Hindu here on Friday that LAL was into manufacture of high speed shuttle looms. However, with the thrust on shuttleless looms, the demand for shuttle looms dropped, and there was lack of sustained orders from the user industry. Based on its 2001 balance sheet, the company was referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and implemented a restructuring scheme, sanctioned by the BIFR, between 2001 and 2010.
Suspending operations
The company manufactured shuttle looms till 2011-12. There was no production of looms at its plants since then due to paucity of orders. However, LAL continued to make spares and accessories. It informed the BSE on Thursday that it was suspending operations at the weaving machinery division at Hosur with immediate effect.
Mr. Doraiswamy said the company had been talking to overseas companies for manufacture of shuttleless looms, and details of the collaboration were expected to be finalised by the end of this financial year.

MRPL faces massive protest from villagers for causing  pollutionMRPL faces massive protest from villagers for causing 'pollution'
Mahesh Kulkarni | Bangalore Oct 11, 2014 09:35 PM IST
Fresh trouble is brewing for Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL), an Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) comp-any, with the affected residents living in the vicinity of its petrochemicals complex protesting against the refiner for causing alleged air, noise and water pollution.
Hundreds of residents of Jokatte village, which is loca-ted adjacent to MRPL’s sulp-hur and coke plants, are planning to stage a massive pro-test rally in Mangalore in the coming days. They staged a demonstration in front of the office of deputy commissioner, Dakshina Kannada district, on Friday and submi-tted a memorandum to the government.
They are demanding imm-ediate suspension of sulphur and coke plants. The residents have experienced extreme air and noise pollution ever since the company partially commissioned its third phase expansion that includes sulphur and coke plants.
“The MRPL recently commissioned their third phase plants and they are producing at only 25 per cent of their capacities. The villagers can-not even sleep properly. The water in the nearby lake and wells has been contaminated. Even fish has disappeared from the lake. We want the government to take immediate action and ask the company to close down the sulphur and coke plants,” Muneer Katipalla, state president of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) told Business Standard.
The residents of the surrounding villages are suffering from many diseases and their health is deteriorating due to the coke and sulphur manufacturing units. The villagers’ life is in serious danger, he said.
MRPL acquired 274 acres at Mangalore Special Economic Zone (MSEZ) to expand its refinery in the third phase, which is adjacent to Jokatte village. It has invested Rs 15,000 crore for the expansion. It is yet to commission the polypropylene plant, which is likely to be done by December this year.
While acquiring the land for MSEZ, the Jokatte was left out, which is spread over close to 200 acres.
There are around 800 families residing in the village. MRPL’s third phase facilities are located just around 100 metres away from the residential colonies of Jokatte. “Many villagers are demanding that their lands should also be acquired by MRPL. But, we are demanding the gov-ernment to close down the sulphur and coke plants because the pollution is spread to many other villages between Surathkal and Bajpe,” Katipalla said.
Meanwhile, H Kumar, managing director, MRPL met Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Bangalore and discussed various issues.
“MRPL has taken all possible pollution control measures as stipulated by MoEF and KSPCB. At MRPL 24x7 air and sound monitoring is being done and drinking wells water is being checked every quarter. All reports indicate that there is no cause for concern for the people of Jokatte or around the Refinery,” a company spokesperson said.
Following complaints from the people of Jokatte Village Karnataka Minister for Environment & Forest Ram-nath Rai has appointed an expert “Technical Advisory Committee (TAC)” for site inspection and recomm-endation of mitigating measures if required.
This Committee has visited MRPL recently and their report is awaited.  
MRPL is committed to implementing further mitigating recommendations if any, in addition to what has already been implemented, the spokesperson added.
 

Cyclone Hudhud to touch 195 kmph speed tomorrow morning  thousands evacuatedComments
Cyclone Hudhud is surging toward Visakhapatnam at 180 kmph and is expected to hit the coast at noon,  said officials on Sunday as thousands in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa braced for the tropical storm.
Heavy winds lashed Visakhapatnam coast as Hudhud lay 110 km southwest of the port city. “Pre-cyclonic conditions are quite active six hours before the landfall. Heavy winds are lashing Visakhapatnam and surrounding areas. Wind speed can go up to 200 kmph when it hits the land,” said director of the Cyclone Warning Centre Ramachandra Rao.
Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on Saturday started evacuating thousands of people as Hudhud barrelled towards the east coast states, furiously picking up pace. By Sunday morning, hours before it makes landfall in Visakhapatnam, it would have attained its top speed of 195kmph, the weather office warned.

Around 1.1 lakh people in Andhra and more than 26,000 in Odisha were evacuated on Saturday as it started raining heavily and the seas turned choppy. All fishing operations were suspended in six districts of Andhra and four of Odisha.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high level emergency meeting to review preparedness. The National Crisis Management Committee also met after discussions with the chief secretaries of the two states.

Over two lakh people living in and around the vulnerable coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have been evacuated.
In Andhra, 370 relief camps have been opened in five districts - Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and West Godavari - where 396 villages are likely to be affected.
In Odisha, officials have evacuated 360 members of the endangered Bonda tribe from their habitat in the Bonda Hills in Malkangiri district. The state government began evacuating people from vulnerable areas to minimise casualties even as two flights and 39 trains on the route were cancelled.
Odisha administration officials visited seaside villages urging people to move but many stayed put. The police did not force them on to buses heading towards some 300-odd storm shelters, unlike during Cyclone Phailin last year, which left close to 30 dead and displaced 400,000.
 
Cyclone Hudhud: Evacuation begins in Andhra, Odisha
Keeping in mind the safety of the passengers, several flights to and from Visakhapatnam to Bhubaneswar, Banglore, Hyderabad and Kolkata were cancelled on Saturday due to strong winds.
Railways have cancelled the movement of about 40 trains between Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam and diverted many trains to other routes for safety.
Tirupati-Bhubaneswar Express, Bangalore-Bhubaneswar Premium Special, Jagadalpur-Howrah Samaleswari Express, Bhubaneswar Junagarh Express, Visakhapatnam-Secunderabad Express, Visakhapatnam-Guntur Express and Tirupati-Visakhapatnam Express are some of the trains which have been cancelled as a precautionary measure, said a senior Railway Ministry official.

East Coast Railway has made elaborate arrangements to meet the situtation that could arise out of the cyclonic storm and heavy rains.
Hudhud is forecasted to maintain its intensity for up to six hours after landfall before gradually weakening into a cyclonic storm while moving across southern interior Odisha and Chhattisgarh, the Met said. It will bring heavy rain to west and east Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts of Andhra and Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri, Kalahandi and Phulbani in Odisha in the next 48 hours. In addition, south Chhattisgarh and north Telangana will also receive rain.

The Centre has stationed 39 National Disaster Response Force teams comprising more than 1,680 rescuers along with 199 inflatable rubber boats in the two states and deployed 20 army rescue and engineering teams. The air force, navy and Coast Guard are also on standby.

SC to decide on CBI petition on JayalalithaaSC to decide on CBI petition on Jayalalithaa

More trouble seems to be in store for former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, sentenced to four years in jail by a Bengaluru court.
The Supreme Court is set to conduct final hearings in a special leave petition filed by the CBI challenging a Madras high court judgment quashing its chargesheet against her in a corruption case.
The CBI had filed a case in 1996 against her under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) act for alleged criminal misconduct and obtaining of valuable thing/s. It had alleged that Jayalalithaa, on her birthday in 1992, had accepted R1.26 crore in ‘gifts’ via demand drafts when she was the state’s chief minister. “The demand drafts were accepted without consideration from people with whom she had current or potential official transactions,” said a CBI source.
The CBI had in 2006 chargesheeted Jayalalithaa in a Chennai court under the PC act for the alleged offence.
But the high court in 2011, acting on petition by Jayalalithaa, had quashed the CBI’s chargesheet on grounds of “unexplained delay” in registering the case then filing of the chargesheet.
The CBI filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court in 2012 challenging the high court’s order.

Former Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala surrenders at Tihar jailComments
Former Haryana chief minister and INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala on Saturday surrendered at Tihar jail a day after the Delhi High Court asked him to do so for misusing bail conditions by campaigning for assembly polls in Haryana.
Chautala, who was on bail, surrendered around 8:40 pm and was sent to jail number two where he was earlier lodged.
The Delhi High Court had on Friday ordered him to surrender by Saturday, making it clear that it would not entertain any plea on extension of time for surrender.
A top Tihar official said 7 pm is the “lock out time” and as Chautala arrived almost one-and-a-half hours after the deadline, the authorities will report the matter to the court. The INLD leader went to jail on a white SUV accompanied by a number of supporters.
Chautala was granted bail on medical grounds on May 21, 2013. Since then he has been out by extending the bail on the same ground.
Addressing the media earlier, Chautala alleged that the haste in sending him to prison was the BJP’s ploy and a result of the party’s insecurity about the coming assembly elections in Haryana.
 “The BJP was scared that people will vote in our favour if I campaign in the state. This is why they wanted me back in jail before the elections. However, this has irritated the people even more,” said Chautala.
A special CBI court had on January 22, 2013 convicted and sentenced Chautala, his son Ajay and eight others to 10-year jail term each for illegally recruiting 3,206 junior teachers in 2000. His appeal against the verdict is pending in the high court.

HealthifyMe, a Bangalore-based startup that provides wellness services on the cloud, began as an idea in the mind of its co-founder Tushar Vashisht while working as a volunteer for the unique identity (UID) project under its chairman Nandan Nilekani.
Vashisht, a graduate from the University of Pennsylvania and a former investment banker, refined the idea by trying to understand the food habits of Indians living on Rs 100 a day, and then built the application HealthifyMe with Sachin Shenoy, a former engineer at Google's research laboratory in India. The application combines a nutrition database with services from experts offered on the cloud. It could disrupt the way wellness services are offered in India.
In just over a year, HealthifyMe  has been downloaded over 30,000 times, a significant percentage of them by paid users. Its users include Google India Managing Director Rajan Anandan and Gopal Srinivasan, chairman and managing director of TVS Capital Funds.
Available on Android, HealthifyMe allows users to achieve fitness goals using smartphones. It has a database of Indian food with nutrition and calorie information and is supported in real-time by a team of doctors, nutritionists and fitness trainers to advise on food intake and exercises needed to burn excess calories.
"When we started two-and-a-half years ago, it was a very bold for any app to just focus on Indian customers. Fundamentally, it was not possible to create a business in the digital space targeting Indian consumers. But we thought that two years down the line when our product was ready, Indian consumers would also be ready to pay for such a service," said Vashisht. "The good news is that, we are beginning to see that bet paying off."
In 2011, Vashisht quit his job in Deutsche Bank, Singapore, to work with India's ambitious UID project. He started working in the business development and project strategy team reporting to Nilekani and Bala Parthasarathy, co-founder of Snapfish, an online photo storage and sharing platform that was acquired by H-P for around $300 million. Parthasarathy had, along with scores of other techies and entrepreneurs, joined the UIDAI. "I joined the UIDAI thinking that I will work for the common man. After working for a year-and-a-half without pay, I figured I had enough policy research but what really mattered was to know how it felt to be a common person."
It was then Vashisht and a friend, Mathew Cherian, an MIT  graduate, started the mission to first live on Rs 100 a day, and then Rs 32 a day, the poverty line as defined by the government. "We realised that you cannot track your basic food. When I was living on Rs 100 a day, I could not track my bisi bele baath (a Kannada dish) and dosa. So we started building our first tool in a deep excel sheet after noting down the raw values of Indian foods," recalls Vashisht.
One of the many things the duo realised was why Indians need more protein instead of carbohydrates. Their experiment got enough media attention in India and abroad and Vashisht and Cherian were frequently invited to give talks to academic institutions, organisations and MPs. Interestingly, on every occasion they found people wanted a copy of the excel sheet they had created on the nutrition database.
Vashisht and his team then built a mobile app and put the data in the cloud so that everybody could access it. However, he realised that an app was not going to help him monetise the platform. Human services on the cloud gave it an integrated experience. A feature called Live Track provides an idea about how many calories are burnt when users start working out. The application has a voice command system that can read out the calorie content of food when asked. Additionally, users can click a picture of the dish and receive details about its calorie content.
