Welcome  Mr Mycroft HolmesPrint
By: Entertainment Feature Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 12:06 am
This December, the queues leading up to the Mumbai Film and Comic Con (MFCC) will get longer with fan boys and girls clutching on to their Sherlock and Doctor Who merchandise. Mark Gatiss, co-creator and writer for these popular series on BBC, will be a special guest at MFCC, to be held at the Bombay Exhibition Centre in Goregaon East from December 19-21.
Jatin Varma, founder of Comic Con India, says, “We were in touch with BBC for a year and wanted to invite someone from the Sherlock team, because of the massive following it enjoys in India. A few months ago, they confirmed that Mark is available during these dates, and also very excited to visit the country and meet his Indian fans.”
Gatiss was a part of the comedy sketch troupe The League of Gentlemen, and went on to write for the modern television revival of Doctor Who. Later with Steven Moffat, he created and produced BBC’s Sherlock, a modern-day adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes. He also played Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s astute and influential brother. Next year, he will join Game of Thrones as the character Tycho Nestoris.
In a statement released by MFCC, Gatiss says, “Stage Two of World Domination complete!’I’m thrilled to be coming to India, a country I’ve always wanted to visit, and I can’t wait to meet all the Doctor Who and Sherlock fans in Mumbai.”
Varma says the British actor-writer-producer will attend all three days of the Comic Con “He will be part of two sessions; one on his work, and the other dedicated to Sherlock.” MFCC is also planning a special screening of Doctor Who with Gatiss.

U.S. Companies Now Stashing $2 Trillion Overseas
Shorter term for undertrial who forgedorderPrint
Written by Kaunain Sherrif | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:18 am
In November 2013, Metropolitan Magistrate Anuj Aggarwal received a request from Rohini Jail authorities to review its March 2012 order — permitting undertrial prisoner Virender to use sport shoes, leather belt, a wrist watch with chain, carry bag and a diary. While reading the request, the magistrate realised that the order was forged and directed police to register an FIR.
After investigation was carried out, a trial court, relying heavily upon forensic report, held Virender guilty under IPC Section 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and sentenced him to seven years rigorous imprisonment. The convict then moved the sessions court to challenge this order.
However, a sessions court on Monday, while upholding the conviction of Virender, reduced his sentence from seven years to three by diluting the charge of forgery to that under IPC Section 474 (possessing forged document.
Meanwhile, the author of the forged document has still not been traced.
Virender, who is in his 20s, is facing trial in other cases including murder, attempted murder and robbery. According to the prosecution, on November 22, 2012, Virender, who was lodged in Rohini jail, was found wearing sports shoes, chain, wrist watch and a belt. Asked for an explanation by the assistant superintendent of the jail, he presented a court order which permitted him to use the articles.
Suspecting the document to be forged, the assistant superintendent forwarded it to the court for review after which it was found that the magistrate, whose signatures and stamps were used on it, had never passed such an order.
Reducing Virender’s jail term, the sessions court on Monday said the forensic opinion did not nail down the accused as the author of the forged order of the court.
“There is nothing on record to substantiate the theory of criminal conspiracy. The forensic opinion also does not nail down the accused as author of the forged order of the court, and therefore, the trial court should not have held him guilty under Section 468 of the IPC,” Additional Sessions Judge Manoj Jain said.

Telework abuse hearing: A serious problem

The Commerce Department inspector general Tuesday described a culture at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that “has deemphasized time and attendance rules in favor of production goals.”
Inspector General Todd J. Zinser, speaking at a joint House hearing on fraudulent practices uncovered last year by an internal review team of patent officials, told lawmakers that “based on the evidence we have seen so far, I do not think abuse has reached a systemic level.”
But he called various practices that allow patent examiners to collect bonuses, overtime and salaries for work they did not do “nonetheless a serious problem.”
“It would be extremely easy for large numbers of the PTO workforce to cheat on their time if they want to do so.”
“Senior leaders need to ensure they do not minimize the problem,” Zinser said.
He urged the agency to adopt all of the recommendations in a 32-page report that documented multiple practices that allow patent examiners to game the system. The report followed allegations by four whistleblowers of fraudulent practices, but it was watered down by top patent officials , who submitted a review half the length to Zinser’s office, which had requested an investigation.
Zinser said the patent office should “recognize and reward” the six executives who wrote the report “for their courage.”

Encrypting Web site traffic could become easier next yearBy Andrea Peterson November 18 Follow @kansasalps
No, this is not what encryption looks like. (Kacper Pempel/Reuters)
Your online activities are only protected from prying eyes if the sites and services you're using are encrypted -- a process noted in many browsers with a little lock icon in the URL bar. But not every Web site is encrypted.
A new project could make it easier than ever for Web site administrators to provide a basic layer of security to its visitors. Mozilla, Cisco, Akamai, Electronic Frontier Foundation, IdenTrust and researchers at the University of Michigan have formed a nonprofit organization, the Internet Security Research Group [ISRG], that will offer free, automated "security certificates" for Web sites starting next year.
A security certificate verifies the authenticity of a site offering an encrypted connection. The Web address of such sites start with “https” rather than “http” and the Internet traffic that travels through such connections can be read only by the sender and its intended recipient.
But the certificates can be cumbersome to obtain and set up. "Today, if you try to add encryption and security to a Web site, it takes many hours for even skilled administrator to figure out how to get, install and configure the correct certificate," according to EFF's Peter Eckersley. The Let's Encrypt certificate will take 20-30 seconds to install and will be free when it launches next year, he said.
ISRG aims to shift the majority of the Web's traffic to encrypted sites. Currently, only a small percentage of Web sites are encrypted by default, although years of advocacy by groups like EFF have convinced many big name sites to make the shift, says Eckersley. Developers at the New York Times recently  challenge d  news organizations to encrypt their sites by default by the end of 2015.
EFF and University of Michigan researchers were working on an automated security certificate system when they learned of a similar project at Mozilla. They decided earlier this year to combine the projects and create the Let's Encrypt technology.
ISRG will spend the next few months making sure the security of the system is as close to "bulletproof" as possible, said Eckersley. "Certificate authorities have the entire fate of the Internet in their hands and they can't afford to make mistakes because it leaves Web sites vulnerable," he says.
In the past, fraudulent security certificates have been the been at the center of some major cybercrimes. In 2011, an Iranian hacker gained access to a company that issues security certificates and created fraudulent certificates that allowed him to impersonate Gmail, and intercept traffic of some 300,000 Iranians .
EFF has been working on efforts to expand the encryption of Web traffic for years. It developed a browser extension called HTTPS Everywhere that forces Web sites to make an encrypted connection when it's available. But that encrypted connection is only available if the Web site already has a security certificate -- the problem that Let's Encrypt is attempting to solve.
"The system of certificates that underpins the Web is a vast and often dysfunctional bureaucracy," Eckersley said.
Fixing that problem would make the Web secure for all users.  "If you're looking at an unencrypted HTTP Web site, your communications are vulnerable to account hijacking, identify theft, many forms of surveillance, interference and modification of the pages you're looking at. All of these problems are widespread and happen every day. With HTTPS the barriers for those who want to spy on your browsing or mess with your traffic are much higher."
Andrea Peterson covers technology policy for The Washington Post, with an emphasis on cybersecurity, consumer privacy, transparency, surveillance and open government.

Shubert Organization buys off-Broadway complex...and
versions
NEW YORK (AP) — The Shubert Organization, Broadway's largest landlord, has extended its off-Broadway reach by buying the lease for the five-theater complex New World Stages.
The move announced Tuesday gives the Shubert Organization more flexibility as it shepherds shows to off-Broadway or readies them for Broadway homes. It gives Shubert about 1,900 new seats to fill, with cheaper labor costs than Broadway. No terms were disclosed.
The organization owns and operates 17 of Broadway's 40 theaters, the off-Broadway Little Shubert and the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia. It also owns the ticket-seller Telecharge.
New World Stages, which is located at Manhattan's West 50th Street and has four tenants including "iLuminate" and "The Bubble Show," was bought from Stage Entertainment, a leading European producer that recently gambled and lost putting on "Rocky" on Broadway.
New World Stages has lately emerged as a place where some fading Broadway shows have found new life, including "Million Dollar Quartet," ''Avenue Q" and "Peter and the Starcatcher." The five theaters range in size from 199 to 499 seats, and the Shubert Organization said all current shows will continue.

Fracking to be permitted in GW National Forest...and
versions
NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — Environmentalists and energy boosters alike welcomed a federal compromise announced Tuesday that will allow fracking in the largest national forest in the eastern United States, but make most of its woods off-limits to drilling.
The decision was highly anticipated because about half of the George Washington National Forest sits atop the Marcellus shale formation, a vast underground deposit of natural gas that runs from upstate New York to West Virginia and yields more than $10 billion in gas a year.
The federal management plan reverses an outright ban on hydraulic fracturing that the U.S. Forest Service had proposed in 2011 for the 1.1 million-acre forest, which includes the headwaters of the James and Potomac rivers. Those rivers feed the Chesapeake Bay, which is the focus of a multibillion-dollar, multistate restoration directed by the Environmental Protection Agency.
A total ban would have been a first for America's national forests, which unlike national parks are commonly leased out for mining, timber and drilling. But some environmentalists were pleased that at least some balance was struck between energy development and conservation.
"We think the decision shows the Forest Service listened to the local community," said Sarah Francisco, leader of the Southern Environmental Law Center's national forests and parks program. "The vast majority of the forest is protected in this decision."
With both sides lobbying hard, Virginia's Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe told his climate change panel in September that federal officials had assured him fracking was off the table. "I won't allow it as long as I'm governor," he said.
But the final word rested with Ken Arney, a regional Forest Service manager. And by Tuesday afternoon, well after the decision was announced, the governor wasn't commenting.
"We think we've ended up in a much better place, which is we are allowing oil and gas drilling," said Robert Bonnie, the undersecretary for national resources and environment at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service.
"From a policy perspective, the Forest Service allows fracking on forest lands throughout the country. We didn't want to make a policy decision or change policy related to fracking," Bonnie told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
The new plan eliminates the potential for oil and gas leases on 985,000 acres where they could have been granted, and permits drilling only on 167,000 acres with existing private mineral rights and 10,000 acres already leased to oil and gas companies. The private mineral rights are scattered throughout the forest, which hadn't updated its management plan since 1993.
This lobbying fight was mostly over principle, since no energy company has wanted to actually drill on the land they're leasing, Bonnie acknowledged. "The economic value of these reserves is very low. We've had very little interest on oil and gas on the forest," Bonnie said.
Also, more environmental analysis and public comment would be encouraged before any drilling is approved, the Forest Service said.
Fracking enables the extraction of oil and gas from otherwise marginal shale deposits by injecting water mixed with chemicals and sand or gravel deep underground at extremely high pressure.
Environmental groups fear the drilling and its waste could pollute mountain streams that directly provide drinking water to about 260,000 people in the Shenandoah Valley. Another 2.7 million people in Northern Virginia and Washington get part of their drinking water from the forest.
"The risks of fracking are well documented, from water, air and climate pollution to the industrialization of special places," Glen Besa, director of the Sierra Club's Virginia chapter, said in a statement.
"Unfortunately, these risks remain for the existing leases in the forest.  While the leases may be low value, they are certainly high risk."
Opponents also argued that the trucks, wells and other infrastructure that would come with gas drilling are incompatible with the forest's primary attractions of hiking, fishing, hunting, camping, tourism and its abundant wildlife. The forest includes a section of the Appalachian Trail and attracts more than 1 million visitors annually.
The American Petroleum Institute maintains that hydraulic fracturing can be done safely and without risk to groundwater, but the science has not been conclusive.
"Natural gas is an enormously versatile fuel that helps power our nation's economy. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is helping to unlock the tremendous economic and job creation benefits that Virginians, and all Americans, need and want," Virginia Petroleum Council Executive Director Michael Ward said in a statement.

Japan recession could slow some US companies... 
MATTHEW CRAFT | November 18, 2014 05:12 PM EST | Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) — Japan has slipped back into a recession for the second time in two years. That could mean more trouble for a range of U.S companies and industries that count on the country for sales.
Best known as an exporter of cars, gadgets and comic books, Japan is also a key consumer of U.S. goods and services from name-brand companies. Japanese customers take a shine to diamonds from Tiffany, strap on handbags from Coach, and ride choppers from Harley-Davidson.
"If the Japanese economy continues to shrink, it has a big impact on other countries," says Sheila Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "It's not like some isolated economy. Having a strong and vibrant Japan is important for everybody."
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced steps aimed at keeping the downturn from getting worse. Abe postponed another hike in the national sales tax and called for national elections next month. An increase in that sales tax earlier this year has been widely blamed for the most recent slump.
Here's a brief look at the economic ties between the U.S. and Japan, the world's third-largest economy, as well as the American businesses that could be hardest hit by the recession.
SIZE: Japan ranked as the fourth-largest trading partner for the U.S. last year, with $204 billion in goods passing between the two countries, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office. Even though Japan sells more to the rest of the world than it buys, it's still a top destination for U.S. exports, after Canada, Mexico and China.
FROM JET PARTS TO PORK: What does Japan buy from the U.S.? A wide variety of things, starting with chemicals and transportation equipment. Last year, sales of medical instruments to Japan totaled $8 billion and aircraft totaled $7 billion, according to the USTR. Japan spent $3.3 billion on American pork and beef.
EXPOSED: The companies with the most to lose from an ailing Japan include insurers and luxury retailers. Coach and Tiffany & Co. rely on Japanese customers for more than 10 percent of their sales. Adobe Systems, the software company, generates a similar share of its sales from Japan.
THAT DUCK: At the extreme end sits Aflac. It's essentially a Japanese company based in Columbus, Georgia. In its most recent quarter, 74 percent of its revenue came from selling insurance and generating investment income in Japan.
DRAG ON BAGS: Coach, the maker of luxury handbags, reported that its Japanese sales sank 7 percent in its latest quarter. Victor Luis, the company's CEO, told investors on a conference call that the decline reflected the "continuing impact" of the country's higher consumption tax. Factor in the weaker yen, and Coach's overall sales in Japan as measured in U.S. dollars fell 12 percent.
HOGS: Harley Davidson, which gets a tenth of its revenue from Japan, said Japanese sales of its rumbling motorcycles slumped 7 percent in the three months ending in September.
UNPLEASANT SURPRISE: Japan's government said Monday that the country's economy shrank 1.6 percent between July and September, the second straight quarterly decline — a common definition of a recession. The slowdown surprised most economists, who had expected Japan to expand at a 2 percent rate after shrinking 7 percent in the previous quarter.

6 Steps for Making Tough Business Decisionsreddit
Is there anything more important to the success of a company than decision making? And is there any other process that occurs so often in a company that is accomplished so haphazardly?
The decisions that are made, from the boardroom and the corner office on down, dictate the direction that the company goes. Yet, decision making may be the only area of a company that doesn't have a clear structure or process for maximizing quality. Think about it. Sales, marketing, finance, and research and development all have formal procedures in place to ensure that their outputs are both effective and efficient. There is, however, rarely such processes in place to ensure uniformity in the quality of a company's decision making. And this absence can lead to some horrendous and potentially catastrophic decisions.
In my consulting work in the corporate world, I have found that business people have considerable confidence in their decision-making capabilities. I have also found that their confidence is often unjustified and sometimes based more in fantasy than reality. Researc h has also found that decision making is rife with cognitive biases that make objective and rational decisions incredibly difficult. Yet, little attention and time is devoted to creating a structure and process that will help develop that which facilitates good decision making and mitigates those factors that lead to poor decision making.
Precision Decision Model
Like any system, decision making is most effective when it is structured and organized. A decision-making system provides companies with a consistent process that can be adhered to and, after decisions have been made, evaluated and adjusted for the quality of their outputs.
Through my work in the business world, I have developed what I call the Precision Decision model of decision making (see image below).
The Precision Decision model provides companies with a framework for quality decisions while allowing for flexibility in its implementation. My Precision Decision model is comprised of six stages that progressively guide you through the decision making process. Within the six stages are a series of specific questions and a key recommendation to avoid common pitfalls at the different points in the decision-making process.
Stage 1: Frame the Issue
This stage involves understanding with absolute clarity what the issue is and what type of decision is going to be made. Essential questions to ask include:
What is the issue we are presented with?
What is some essential background to the issue?
What has been done so far including what has been considered and not pursued?
What is a simple and clear statement that best describes the current decision (i.e., "The  decision to be made is...")?
The best decisions most often come from a collaboration between people with the ideal combination of knowledge, skill sets, perspectives, and experience. A common pitfall in this initial stage of decision making is not getting the right people involved. You can avoid this trap by identifying the areas of expertise that need to be included and carefully selecting a group of people who can provide a broad and deep perspective on the presenting issue.
Stage 2: Analyze the Issue
Once the issue has been clearly articulated and a decision statement has been created, it's now time to do an extensive analysis of the issue and really delve into its many facets. Key areas to examine include:
Explore the issue from different perspectives (e.g., using the diverse expertise of your decision-making team).
Ask what, why, when, who, where, and how questions so the issue is fully revealed.
Refine the decision statement based on this analysis.
At this stage, one of the most common pitfalls is to assume that you have your arms fully wrapped around the issue and are ready to make the decision. The best way to mitigate this pitfall is to ensure that you are collecting all of the relevant information that will contribute to a quality decision. This can be accomplished by asking the decision team members to leverage their knowledge and experience to bring forward any information that they deem germane, however esoteric it may seem.
Stage 3: Deepen Your Understanding
When your team feels that it has done a thorough analysis of the issue at hand and has a firm grasp of the decision that needs to be made, it's ready to do a "deep dive" and plumb the depths of the decision. Important issues to consider include:
What hat has changed since the issue arose: what, where, when, how.
Brainstorm potential causes of the issue.
Identify the critical contributors to the decision.
A frequent pitfall in this stage is to give up too early when you think that you have a real understanding of the issue. My recommendation is to allow the issue and the potential decision germinate in the relevant stakeholders.
Stage 4: Make the Decision
At some point, of course, a decision must be made. Here, where the rubber meets the road, is when you must take your broad and deep understanding of the issue and begin to identify possible decisions. Essential areas to consider include:
Create a list of possible decisions that could be made.
Explore possible outcomes of the decision options (worst and best cases).
Make the decision.
Ask yourself: Is the decision consistent with your values?
Jumping to conclusions is the most likely pitfall in this stage. As you filter through possible decisions, each can look very attractive and may cause you to choose one prematurely. It is best to commit to a thorough consideration of each decision option before you return to the one that you think is best.
Stage 5: Take Action
This stage is the scariest because you must "put your money where your mouth is." It is also the point at which implementation of the idea becomes as important as the decision itself. As you likely know from experience, the best decisions can fail if they are not put into action effectively. As such, the following four steps will help ensure that the implementation maximizes the likelihood that the decision was, in fact, a good one.
Design a plan to implement decision.
Assign role and responsibilities.
Establish a timetable.
Create accountabilities.
A common pitfall in this stage is to be unrealistic in your expectations of the outcome of the decision. As with most things in business and life, decisions take time to take root and blossom. I suggest that you be patient and allow the decision to slowly reveal its worth.
Stage 6: Debrief
This stage is often one that is overlooked by companies because they are just too busy pursuing the future to take the time to reflect back on the past. This "forensic analysis" provides an evaluation of both the process and outcome of the decision making. Key questions to ask include:
Were cognitive biases monitored?
Was the best decision made?
What you did well and areas for improvement?
Not surprisingly, the greatest pitfall is to not evaluate the decision. The fundamental lessons from the debrief are to identify what worked in the decision-making process (and repeat it) and identify what didn't work (and jettison it). The result is that, with time and consistent adherence to the Precision Decision model, your company fine tunes and customizes the decision-making process until you have developed a system that works effectively with your unique culture and dynamics.
Cognitive Biases
As I noted in a previous article, cognitive biases are bad for business . Yet, they are also ever present in the business world. An essential part of the Precision Decision model involves constantly checking in at each stage of the process to ensure that cognitive biases have a negligible effect on the decisions that are made.
Conclusion
The ultimate outcome is a series of from-to shifts in decision making that reduces the number of poor decisions and dramatically increases the number of sound decisions.
From little understanding of effective decision making to an in-depth understanding of effective decision making.
From "siloed" thinking in decision making to cross-functional and collaborative decision making.
From cognitive biases interfering with effective decision making to understanding how to mitigate the negative influence of cognitive biases on decision making.
From unclear structure and process for collaborative decision making to a highly defined and disciplined approach to decision making.
And this conclusion can only mean good things for the future of your company.

Hillary Clinton campaigns for compromise at Chicago event1
Practiced anecdotes included how she lugged a wagon full of sports equipment 3 miles to and from her home three days a week as part of her responsibilities with the Park Ridge park district at age 13, her first non-baby-sitting job, a nice story but hardly Abe Lincoln trudging through snow to return a book. She told how she spent a week in Alaska "sliming fish" after college, literally ripping out the guts of freshly caught and some not-so-fresh salmon.
Like being a Cubs fan, she said, "sliming fish prepared me for life."
What she didn't say, though it's true, both experiences may require holding one's nose at times to continue forward.
"Compromise is at the core of a democracy," Clinton said. "Unless you think that you have a divine mandate and therefore you are in the party of divinity, no human being has all the answers and we do better when we listen to each other, kind of understand the perspective of each and reach an honorable compromise.
"It is deeply distressing to me that we have people running for Congress — both the House and the Senate — who proudly go around their districts and their states proclaiming that you should send them to Washington because they will never compromise. I don't care whether you're a liberal Democrat or a really conservative Republican, do not vote for people who do not believe in compromise, because they do not believe in the legislative process of a democracy."
It's to the point where, unbelievably, Clinton now waxes somewhat nostalgic for the right-wing opposition that she lambasted for its tactics when it was going after her husband and thwarting his initiatives 20 years ago, noting "there were enough people who had the muscle memory of real legislating that you could make deals" and work got done.
"Back in the '90s, as challenging as it was, there were still leaders on the other side of the aisle who understood the responsibility of governing," Clinton said. "Newt Gingrich would spend all day, every day attacking Bill and sometimes me all over the TV and at 9 o'clock at night come over to the White House. He'd go up to the second floor and he and Bill would try to hammer out the details for deals."
Clinton blamed the current standoff in Washington for undercutting the United States' ability to project strength in the international leadership role no other nation seems willing to assume. She blamed it for a failure of Congress to come up with incentives to coax U.S. companies to repatriate the billions of dollars parked overseas for tax reasons, rather than invested at home.
Recalling a medical device industry trade show at which she recently spoke, she said attendees bemoaned delays in getting federal Food and Drug Administration approval for new products. She pointed to cuts mandated because Congress couldn't agree to a compromise budget.
"The FDA doesn't have the personnel to be able to expedite American innovation in medical technology," Clinton said. "That costs us money. That costs us jobs. It costs us investment. It costs us exports.
"There are just a lot of issues that if we could work together again and we could listen to each other and we could actually learn from each other and not go into any conversation believing that we or the other side was (completely) right or wrong, I think we could begin to spark more job creation."
But even as she scolds those who would rather break the system then bend on personal principle, Clinton concedes there are some concessions she herself could not make.

Do you still set your courses by Michelin stars0
Michelin was a leader in this field. But a U.S. pioneer in authoritative restaurant guides started out by compiling his own notes on restaurants while on the road as a salesman for a Chicago printing firm. His name is familiar still, though not for the invaluable reviews first published in 1936 as "Adventures in Good Eating for the Discriminating Motorist":
It's Duncan Hines.
Fifty-five years after Hines' death, his cake-mix brand outlives the reputation as a discerning diner that scored him that lucrative business tie-in, but straight-forward reviews are his most impactful legacy.
One from 1939, for example, touted a 24-hour restaurant in Corbin, Ky., as "a very good place to stop en route to Cumberland Falls and the Great Smokies" and noted its steaks, country ham, biscuits and, not least of all, its fried chicken.
The proprietor was Harland Sanders — as in Col. Sanders, who would begin actively franchising his "finger lickin' good" Kentucky Fried Chicken in the 1950s.
Hines was nothing if not a dedicated foodie. According to a 1938 Chicago Tribune profile found by his biographer, Louis Hatchett, Hines frequently drove to Nashville for what he believed to be America's best apple pie, its crust made with a mixture of chicken fat with shortening.
Hines reportedly bought his household coffee from a place in the city on Chicago Avenue but headed out to an unincorporated area near Wilmette for his preferred milk and cream.
Merchants and restaurateurs today cater to that sort of devotion. They are rewarded not only with business but patrons posting pictures and bite-by-bite reviews. But not everyone buys in.
"I start with the question of who's paying," Cowen said. "If I'm spending my own money — I'm not rich, but I'm not poor — I can go to these (Michelin-ranked) places if I want, but I don't actually enjoy it more than really good ethnic food."
Besides, people who run with a crowd that can afford to routinely eat at top-tier restaurants like Alinea or Sixteen may not get the after-dinner treat or sustenance sought from chasing Michelin stars.
"People want to do something unique that they can talk about and other people haven't done, but to go to a three-star (restaurant) may not make that bar anymore," Cowen said.
Michelin's reviews are part of the discussion but hardly the last word.

Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler wonders why its so cold if global warming exists. Heres the answer.By Philip Bump November 18 Follow @pbump
It is that time of year when the weather gets cold — even unexpectedly cold — and online humorists and armchair scientists rise up as one to ask a question: " What happened to 'global warming' ???" It's a good gag, see, because it's cold and global warming implies that it will be warm. If you don't get it, please e-mail me and I will explain further.
With the current cold snap that's blanketing the country, even a member of Congress couldn't resist.
Global warming strikes America! Brrrr!
— Rep. Vicky Hartzler (@RepHartzler) November 18, 2014
There are two options for what Hartzler, a Republican who represents Missouri's 4th District, hopes to accomplish here. The first is that she's making a joke about a serious environmental issue that has scientists around the world concerned about how mankind will fare under warmer conditions. We assume a member of Congress wouldn't make such a joke.
So let's assume Hartzler is actually wondering what happened to climate change (which is what conservative message-man Frank Luntz recommended Republicans call the effect ). And for that we have an answer.
Hartzler's district sits just southeast of Kansas City, Mo. Over the past four decades, Kansas City has gotten about half a degree warmer on average every decade.
Kansas City is a city, though, and cities experience something called the "heat island effect." All that pavement and concrete tends to exacerbate heating trends, and Kansas City is one of the worst in the country in that regard. It is about 4.6 degrees hotter during the summer than nearby rural areas, such as those that Hartzler represents.
Her district is in Missouri's third climate division , as near as we can tell. That area has gotten about 0.1 degrees warmer each decade for the past century.
The trick with climate change, of course, is that it's hard to pinpoint specific local effects. That's what makes things like "hey, it's cold, where's the climate change?" somewhat effective rhetorically. But the government has outlined a good preview of how climate change is and will affect the Midwest broadly , the sort of analysis that is currently possible.
Here, for example, is the government's projection of the increased number of 95-degree-plus days by 2050 as the climate warms. Hartzler's district is in the dark red part of Missouri.
But heat is just one effect, according to the climate report mentioned above.
Direct effects will include increased heat stress, flooding, drought, and late spring freezes. Climate change also alters pests and disease prevalence, competition from non-native or opportunistic native species, ecosystem disturbances, land-use change, landscape fragmentation, atmospheric and watershed pollutants, and economic shocks such as crop failures, reduced yields, or toxic blooms of algae due to extreme weather events.
That's what the Midwest can expect.
But maybe Hartzler wasn't referring only to the temperature in Missouri or Washington today. Maybe she was wondering about global temperatures, over a long period, and thinks there's no evidence of warming.
There is. This chart is from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , showing warming by decade.
That graph doesn't show Nov. 18, 2014, a day on which temperatures are, in many places, colder than normal. Instead, it shows global warming. (Before you get ready to type "warming hiatus!!!," here .)
The study of climate change is dependent on a lot of extrapolations, and the exact effects are hard to predict. One thing that is clear is that there will still be cold days even as temperatures warm. Another thing that is clear is that those cold days will inspire a lot of good jokes on Twitter about climate change. Hopefully Hartzler, at least, will feel as though her implied question has been answered.

State prisons projected to grow 3 percent by 2018By Niraj Chokshi November 18 Follow @NirajC
It looks like the era of shrinking state prison populations was short-lived.
Since the late 1970s, the state prison population essentially knew only one direction: up. But, in 2009, something changed. After all those years of growth, the prison population begin to shrink. And the trend held steady — well, until last year, when growth made a comeback . Now, it seems, it may be here to stay.

The state prison population is poised to grow 3 percent by 2018, according to a Pew Charitable Trusts review of 34 state and outside group projections. Were the forecast accurate, it would suggest the old trend — decades of growth — may be back. Overall, that group is projected to swell by about 26,000 reaching nearly 945,000 in size four years from now, according to the data Pew collected last month and published Tuesday.
The data shows a wide variety by state. Three states foresee double-digit growth: Iowa expects 16 percent, Wyoming projects 14 percent and Alaska expects its prison population to grow by 11 percent. Hawaii and Idaho expect no growth, while five more—North Carolina, Oregon, Massachusetts, Louisiana and Pennsylvania—expect their state prison populations to shrink.
The forecasts are not destiny, of course. States can alter the course through policy. In California, for example, voters earlier this month approved Proposition 47, which downgraded a number of crimes — including several for drug possession — from felonies to misdemeanors and reduced other penalties as well.
Here’s a look at the state data collected by Pew:

Can Republicans shut down the government without actually shutting down the governmentComments
By Paul Waldman November 18
Congressional Republicans face a dilemma. Most believe it would be politically disastrous to shut down the government right after winning control of Congress, proving correct every Democratic argument about how radical and reckless they are. But they want to stop Barack Obama from taking the executive action he has proposed on immigration, and they only have so many points of leverage through which they can do so.
As we’re learning today, Republicans are feverishly strategizing to find some clever way to tie Barack Obama’s hands yet avoid the wave of bad PR a shutdown would bring. Byron York reports on some of the early thinking :
The only thing Republicans will do in the lame duck session — that is, before they take control of the Senate, and keep control of the House, in January — is to make sure a short-term government funding bill is passed by the time the current one expires on Dec. 11.
Then in January, with the GOP in control — and, presumably, Obama’s edict in hand — Republicans will work on crafting a new spending measure that funds the entire government, with the exception of the particular federal offices that will do the specific work of enforcing Obama’s order.
Politico reports more on the idea of splitting government funding into separate bills:
The options include offering a separate piece of immigration legislation on the floor aimed at tightening border security and demanding the president enforce existing laws, promises to renew the effort next year when Republicans have larger numbers in both chambers, and passing two separate funding bills — a short-term bill with tight restrictions on immigration enforcement agencies, and another that would fund the rest of the government until the fall.
If they offered such a bill now, it would die in the Senate, which is still controlled by the Democrats until January. Once we get to next year, President Obama would presumably veto any bill restricting his ability to act on immigration, and if that bill funded the Department of Homeland Security (which includes the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement), we’d then have ourselves a mini-shutdown.
If Obama made a mistake in this chess game, it may have been promising to take executive action before the end of the year, i.e. before Republicans actually take control. Because as long as they’re not completely sure what he’ll do, they can’t write a spending bill to stop it. As it is, the divided Congress can pass a short-term spending bill in the lame duck session, and then Republicans can wait until Obama moves before crafting some new legislative maneuver in the new Congress to confront it. And if anybody can come up with a clever procedural maneuver, it’s Mitch McConnell.
But what we may really end up here is a game of chicken. Obama wants Congress to pass a longer-term spending bill; Republicans want Obama to show his hand on immigration first, so they can figure out how to confront him. And they want to do so in a way that employs their power of the purse without it being labeled a “government shutdown,” complete with news stories about Americans being turned away at national parks. Whoever moves first stands a higher chance of losing.
On the one hand you’d think this situation would encourage the White House to wait on executive action. Holding off might force Republicans to pass a longer-term spending bill in January, leaving Obama free to act. At that point, if Republicans pass a bill to undo it (which is what Rep. Hal Rogers, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, proposed today), Obama could just veto it. On the other hand, perhaps the White House would rather force this confrontation sooner rather than later — baiting Republicans into a frenzy of overreach.
The perfect scenario for Republicans is engineering a partial shutdown that leads Obama to relent on executive action, but doesn’t actually look to the country like a shutdown. If they could pull it off, it would please a base thirsty for a confrontation with Obama and worried about the consequences of the policy changes he is proposing, while not damaging the GOP’s standing with the broader public.
If all this procedural plotting is making your head spin, welcome to the final years of the Obama presidency. You may have noticed that one thing we aren’t talking about is what the country should actually do about our immigration policy. The substantive questions disappear behind a fog of Machiavellian strategizing, a legislative judo match where the only question is whether Democrats or Republicans get thrown to the mat first.
Which is probably where Republicans want this debate to remain. If the discussion turns to what to do about the undocumented population in this country, Republicans will be divided among themselves. But if they shape everything around reacting to Obama’s alleged overreach, they’ll be united.

Jay Gruden to the Redskins: The less you say  the betterBy Dan Steinberg November 18 Follow @dcsportsbog
(By John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
Over the past couple of days, a video clip taken mildly out of context from RGIII’s postgame news conference led to mildly misleading blog headlines , possibly (or possibly not) leading to a DeSean Jackson Instagram flap , leading to a Jay Gruden press conference rejoinder , leading to an RGIII Facebook and Twitter response , leading to  a re-post of a re-post by Jackson .
I fuel my life force with the essence of social media, and even for me, this was all a bit much. So here’s Jay Gruden talking even more about the issue, with his message being that people should probably say less to the media. A message he delivered by talking to the media.
“As a head coach, you have to be concerned about what’s happening off the field that can affect on-the-field play,” Brian Mitchell said during Gruden’s weekly appearance with Comcast SportsNet . “The players stated last week that they were all together, and you see the little pot-shots that are happening with social media. Do you as a coach feel you need to bring those players in and talk to them and set some type of standard for your players moving forward? Because if they say it, we have to talk about it.”
“Yeah, you’re right,” Gruden said. “That’s the beautiful thing with social media. It’s fun. But I addressed it today in front of the team. You know, it’s got to be addressed in front of everybody, so everybody knows what’s happening, and what can happen if you say something that can be construed the wrong way. The more you say things, the more you talk, the more opportunity you give the ‘wonderful’ media a chance to twist your words around, and that’s what’s happening right now. So the less you say, the better. Guys are obligated to speak to the media, but they don’t have to elaborate on other people at other positions. Just talk about themselves.”
“Let’s be honest coach, we don’t always twist the words,” Chick Hernandez noted. “Sometimes the words speak for themselves.”
“Yeah, you’re right,” Gruden agreed.
“You saw DeSean Jackson and his Instagram today,” Hernandez continued. “It’s hard to argue what his point was there. So how do you address that with a player?”
“Same thing,” Gruden said. “Like I said, I read it to everybody on the team today. We just have to make sure that we’re all on the same page and we’re not throwing rocks at each other. It’s hard enough to beat your opponent on a Sunday, when you’re also trying to defeat the media and your own team in your own locker room. So we’ve got to make sure we squash everything right now, get everything out in the open, let everybody understand we’re all on the same team, we’re all trying to accomplish the same goals as a team, and that’s beating the San Francisco 49ers. But we’ve got to squash it all now.”
“You are a very honest coach, which I love about you,” Mitchell said. “Do you ever get concerned about players taking something that you may say the wrong way, or do you feel the truth is the truth?”
“The truth is the truth,” Gruden said. “And sometimes I do talk a little bit too much, and it does get me in trouble. You know, somebody asked me about [Jason] Hatcher a couple weeks ago, and I said, ‘Oh, he needs to play better, as does the whole team.’ And the headline was ‘Gruden says Hatcher needs to play better.’ Which, it happens. But as long as everybody understands that I have their best interests at heart, and I want what’s best for them, and I’m trying to get them to play better, that’s the bottom line. I have a job to do, and that’s to get our team to play better and improve on a weekly and a daily basis.”
Now somehow take a screenshot of this blog post so it can be Instagrammed and re-posted and tweeted and pinned and MySpaced and Vined and Snapchatted and read on a street corner with a megaphone and discussed during weekly regional sports network interviews.

Two more same-sex marriage cases reach the Supreme CourtBy Dale Carpenter November 18
The fallout from the Sixth Circuit’s decision in DeBoer v. Snyder, which denied constitutional claims for same-sex marriage, continued at the Supreme Court yesterday. Petitions for certiorari were filed on Friday in the Sixth Circuit cases from Ohio and Tennessee . On Monday two more cases were filed, one from Michigan and one from Kentucky. At SCOTUSblog, Lyle Deniston has a nice summary of the issues in each.
The Michigan petition squarely asks “[w]hether a state violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by denying same-sex couples the right to marry.” Of the four pending petitions from the Sixth Circuit, it is the only case in which the district court conducted a trial on various questions about parenting and other matters. It also includes Mary Bonauto as counsel. As part of the New England-based Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, Bonauto brought the Goodridge litigation in Massachusetts that resulted in the first same-sex marriages in the United States beginning in 2004.
We learn in the Michigan petition that the state will not oppose certiorari, even though it won in DeBoer:
There is no dispute that the question raised here is of paramount importance. Respondents have advised counsel that they will file a response in this Court indicating that they do not oppose a grant of certiorari. Although prior circuit court rulings found that laws banning marriage by same-sex couples violate the Fourteenth Amendment, the Sixth Circuit disagreed. Gay and lesbian citizens in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee are denied the fundamental freedom and equal right to marry, and their families are deprived of the status, dignity, security, and stability that marriage brings. This Court should grant the petition and hold that prohibiting same-sex couples from joining in marriage violates our nation’s most cherished and essential guarantees.
The Michigan petition addresses all of the main points in the Sixth Circuit’s DeBoer decision, including its misplaced reliance on original meaning , its partial rational-basis analysis , its error in treating animus doctrine as if it is a search for subjective motivations rather than an objective inquiry, its treatment of fundamental rights, and its failure to apply heightened scrutiny. For any number of reasons, if the Court wants to pick just one of the four petitions now before it, the Michigan petition is probably the best candidate.
The Kentucky petition, which raises both the right-to-marry issue and out-of-state recognition, is available here .

John Hodgman: The government should be laying down broadband like Eisenhower laid down interstates( suburbanadventure)
Long before John Oliver called for an end to " cable company f**kery ," another comedian also named John was beating the net neutrality drum. As far back as 2006, author and actor John Hodgman was using postal envelopes to explain how Internet service providers might let content from Google and Amazon through to consumers very easily while discriminating against content from other companies.
Now Hodgman is back at it. In an essay on Tumblr posted Monday night, Hodgman takes aim at large telecom companies who can "control what is increasingly a mandatory purchase" for many Americans: access to high-speed broadband that connects them to information, entertainment and economic opportunity.
Hodgman has some personal stake in the issue as a performer. Arguing that the Internet helps promote artists and small businesses that drive the U.S. economy, Hodgman added that many of the country's dominant telecom providers would not be in their successful position today had they not benefited from public resources such as land and wireless airwaves.
The issue has clearly been on Hodgman's mind for some time. At the end of a lengthy response to a separate BuzzFeed article, Hodgman told his readers he'd be holding an impromptu Q&A session on Tumblr for an hour to discuss Obamacare, net neutrality as well as any other issue his followers thought important. Amid queries on his favorite vegetable (brussels sprouts) and whether to see the movie "Interstellar," (…yes?) Hodgman saved his longest response for last.
"I believe in capitalism but not monopolies," Hodgman wrote. "I believe in entrepreneurship and I am not against government efforts to foster it. I believe more communities should invest in their own broadband to break regional telecom monopolies. Personally I believe that the federal government should be laying down broadband like Eisenhower laid down interstates. And I believe preferential fast-laning for big companies will decrease competition and quality and ultimately hamper what is poised to be the most important area of economic, cultural, and technological innovation of our time."
This isn't far off from what President Obama recommended when he asked the Federal Communications Commission to develop strong rules to prevent broadband providers from giving some apps special treatment over others. But Hodgman stopped short of endorsing Obama's specific policy proposal — that the FCC classify Internet providers under Title II of the Communications Act. Such a move would give the agency expansive powers to oversee broadband companies, though opponents of the idea, including the telecom industry, say it would not be effective in stopping Internet fast lanes.
With his essay Monday, Hodgman dropped the irreverent, ironic character he'd maintained over the course of the Q&A; if there had been a camera, he would've deadpanned into it.
"We have seen what happens when two or one large companies control what is increasingly a MANDATORY purchase in a given region," Hodgman wrote, "whether that’s health insurance or broadband (internet is a de factor [sic] required school supply in most communities now): high prices compared to the rest of the world and compromised service.
"I don’t need to see what will happen if independent e-commerce and media-streaming and journalism is throttled to the point of non-existence by a few big corps that can pay for the fast lane."

Bob Marley-branded marijuana will soon be available thanks to legalizationBy Abby Phillip November 18 Follow @abbydphillip
A portrait of reggae legend Bob Marley hangs next to a menu at the medical marijuana farmers market in Los Angeles. (David McNew/Reuters)
It’s fair to say that Bob Marley probably could not have imagined that 33 years after his death, his name would be lent to what is about to be the newest entrant to the burgeoning legal marijuana market.
The reggae icon was perhaps the most prominent and outspoken advocate of the drug throughout his life and at the height of his fame. He viewed it as a spiritual and creative force that was probably more likely to be legalized by “Christ’s government” than governments here on Earth.
But times have changed – in a big way. Look no further than Tuesday’s announcement by Marley’s family that it plans to piggyback on successful efforts to legalize marijuana in the United States and elsewhere by introducing a new brand of marijuana products bearing the late singer’s name.
“Marley Natural” is being launched by Privateer Holdings, a cannabis industry investment firm, and products will reach the market in late 2015.
“My dad would be so happy to see people understanding the healing power of the herb,” Marley’s daughter Cedella Marley said in a news release. “He viewed the herb as something spiritual that could awaken our well-being, deepen our reflection, connect us to nature and liberate our creativity.”
“Marley Natural is an authentic way to honor his legacy by adding his voice to the conversation about cannabis and helping end the social harms caused by prohibition,” she added. It will offer organically grown heirloom Jamaican marijuana strains, in keeping with Marley’s preference for high-quality marijuana grown without the use of fertilizer. And it will be available in jurisdictions that allow recreational or medicinal marijuana sales. The brand also plans to offer cannabis- and hemp-infused products such as lotions and sun-repair creams.
Marley reportedly smoked as much as a pound of marijuana per week. But at the time of his intense fame in the United States and around the world, he was viewed as a nonconformist symbol.
Marley has become even more of a global icon and brand in the years since his death, but that it’s now happening in a world in which marijuana is decriminalized in some places is something even he didn’t foresee.
“Legalize herb? Boy, I jus’ don’ know. It’s kinda legalized already,” he noted in a 1976 interview with High Times .
He was referring to the widespread use and cultivation of marijuana in Jamaica, where the drug has actually been illegal for over 100 years.
And change is coming there, too.
In late September, the Jamaican government announced that it is considering support for a proposal to decriminalize possession of small amounts of what Marley and Rastafarians called the “holy herb” if it is being used for medicinal, and eventually, religious purposes.
That is a direct result of the loosening of legalization laws in some U.S. states– though marijuana remains an illegal schedule I substance under Federal law. 
Over the years, critics of harsh marijuana laws have argued that the penalties have done little to  stamp out organized crime associated with the trafficking of black market drugs, including marijuana, through the island.
And of course, there is potentially huge financial upside, as the investment firm Privateer Holdings has sought to demonstrate with its recent business ventures in the marijuana space.
“The time has come to provide an opportunity for Jamaicans to benefit from the marijuana industry,” said Kingston’s mayor Angela Brown Burke recently, according to the Associated Press. 
According to a release, the brand will have an unspecified philanthropic component to “ensure that families and communities who have been harmed by prohibition have the opportunity to benefit from the new, legal cannabis economy,” the company’s announcement said.
“My husband believed ‘the herb’ was a natural and positive part of life and he felt it was important to the world,” Marley’s wife Rita said in a statement. “He looked forward to this day.”

The story behind that viral video of a woman rapping Salt-N-Pepa in the carBy Caitlin Dewey November 17 Follow @caitlindewey
Over the weekend, 30-year-old Ontarian Chelsea Ranger did something millions of people do every day: She sang along to a song on the car radio. Salt-N-Pepa’s “None of Your Business,” in this case.
But since her husband secretly filmed the 40-second clip and uploaded it to YouTube  with the title “The cutest gangsta I know, my wife,” Ranger’s solo sing-along has been viewed a startling 3.3 million times. For perspective, that’s roughly 26 percent more people than inhabit the entire city of Toronto — where Ranger and her husband, Paulo Salomao, live.
Of course, it’s not unusual for the Internet to make celebrities of ordinary folks. (We are living in the #AlexfromTarget age .) But even by Internet standards, the virality of Ranger’s clip seems, well — undeserved. It’s just 40 seconds of a woman rapping in a car. Not even rapping a difficult song. Not even rapping particularly well! If you are a human with a smartphone, access to a motor vehicle and even semi-theatrical/performative friends, you probably have such a video yourself.
And yet, in another example of the Internet fame machine’s never-ending randomness, this particular video has been chosen for viral fame. Why?
“I think the inside view of a couple enjoying each other’s company is the main thing,” said Salomao, who’s still a little shell-shocked by the video’s success. “Maybe with so much vulgarism and people trying to gain attention online, when something true and innocent comes along, it gets the credit it deserves?”
Salomao definitely wasn’t seeking attention when he filmed his wife singing; the couple sings and goofs around a lot, he says, and they often film themselves or take photos for fun. (Incidentally, Salomao works in digital media — he’s the creative director and co-founder of the studio  East End Project .) Recently, they posted two photos of their cat on reddit which racked up 60 comments. Salomao was amused enough to post this new video, too, just to see what would happen.
Within the span of a few hours, it had been viewed thousands of times on YouTube — and made the No. 2 spot on reddit’s highly trafficked front page.
“The whole ‘going viral’ felt a little scary — by scary I mean, not knowing what to do really or what’s happening or where it will lead,” Salomao said. “If you are like us, and don’t know anyone famous or don’t have any friends who have gotten so much attention like this, it can be quite surprising.”
Ranger, for her part, is largely unperturbed by her newfound Internet fame. (“She’s a very down to earth and gentle soul,” her husband says.) They have, however, been reading comments on the video, which are overwhelmingly appreciative. The comments have inspired them to think about making more short videos that “share positive simple moments in life.”
It’s a nice idea, but an inherently weird one — after all, it would require the couple to film private, ordinary moments for the purpose of sharing with millions. It’s no longer just Salomao and Ranger singing in the car; it’s Salomao, Ranger and an unseen Internet audience. In some ways, it’s a version of what the Economist once called “the people’s panopticon”  — the tech-enabled possibility, or anxiety, that everything can be recorded and shared all the time. (“Our technology is stealing the romance of old conversations,” fretted Quentin Hardy in the New York Times, “that quaint notion that some things are best forgotten.”)
But personally, Salomao doesn’t see it. We’re already accustomed to recording everything, he says, even when we’re just around family and friends. And if sharing those recordings makes some commenter happy, he’s willing to go for it.
“I do agree with you that phones are everywhere and we can be exposing a lot online lately,” Salomao said. “But like in all things, if you find a good thing to say and can add a tad good into this world, wouldn’t you take a chance?”

Does it really cost $2.6 billion to develop a new drug(Image from StockMonkeys.com )
The never-ending debate about what drugs should cost is in part driven by the fact that no one seems to know what it actually costs to develop one. And now we have a new analysis from an influential think tank for what it believes to be the cost of getting a drug approved: $2.6 billion.
That's the latest projection from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, a research group partially funded by drugmakers. The new figure is more than three times higher than the group's 2001 estimate of $802 million .
The group estimates the average drug discovery and development process costs $1.4 billion. Its estimate includes another $1.2 billion in foregone returns investors would have otherwise seen while the drug was under development. The group estimates that drugmakers on average face another $312 million in research and development costs after a drug gets approved, which could bring the total average cost of development to $2.9 billion.
The prices of many popular prescription drugs have risen sharply over the last decade, leaving consumers wondering why the cost of medicine is so high — and whether pharmaceutical companies need to charge so much to cover the cost of developing drugs, or if they're merely padding their profits. With patents on blockbuster drugs expiring over the past few years, the pharmaceutical industry is under pressure to somehow make up for those losses.
The Tufts center researchers say the cost of developing a drug, when adjusted for inflation, has increased 145 percent overthe past decade. Their findings — which are drawing scrutiny from consumer advocates and academics — attribute the rising costs to higher failure rates for drugs and higher R&D costs. Drugmakers have also been tackling more complex diseases over the past decade, and they must fund research proving the cost effectiveness of new drugs, according to the report.
An overwhelming number of drugs that enter clinical trials don't actually get approved by the FDA, so drugmakers try to recover those costs when they have a successful product. Joseph DiMasi, the lead author of the CSDD study, said the group's estimate takes that into account.
“Drug development remains a costly undertaking despite ongoing efforts across the full spectrum of pharmaceutical and biotech companies to rein in growing R&D costs,” DiMasi said in a statement.
The study itself won't be released until 2015, the researchers said. So far, the Tufts center has only released a slide presentation, a press release and a backgrounder on the study methodology.
Consumer advocates say that estimates from the Tufts research center are often inflated to justify higher drug prices — and the lack of detail released so far on this latest study makes it hard to assess the claims. James Love, director of the non-profit Knowledge Ecology International, said critical information is missing from the analysis, like how many patients were in the drug trials, or how much money was claimed to have been spent on each patient.
"First impression: the study, which is part of a public relations campaign by the drug companies to justify high prices, is long on propaganda, and short of details," wrote Love in a blog post .
Doctors Without Borders was harsher in its assessment. "[I]f you believe [the Tufts analysis], you probably also believe the earth is flat," said policy director Rohit Malpani in a statement .
Other estimates vary on how much it costs to develop a drug. In 2006, Federal Trade Commission researchers tried to replicate aTufts study that pegged the cost of developing a drug at $802 million. The FTC researchers'  findings , published in the policy journal Health Affairs, estimated that the average cost at the time was a little higher, at $868 million — but they found there was considerable variation based on drugmaker and the type of drug. For example, their analysis found that the average cost of drug development was $521 million for one large manufacturer, while it was $2.1 billion for another.
Merrill Goozner, in his book "The $800 Million Pill: The Truth Behind the Cost of New Drugs," writes that the actual development cost was about one-fifth of the last Tufts estimate, contending that most of the drug development relies on taxpayer-funded research. Meanwhile, a Forbes analysis last year of 100 pharmaceutical companies pegged the cost of developing a drug at $5 billion .
And so the debate over how much it costs to develop a drug — and what it should cost — goes on.

German foreign minister tries to save Ukraine peaceplanGerman minister called for drawing a division line between the government troops and pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine.
By: Associated Press | Moscow | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:40 am
Germany’s foreign minister, on a shuttle mission between the Ukrainian and Russian capitals, called Tuesday for quickly drawing a division line between the government troops and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine to save a floundering peace deal.
Even though the cease-fire agreement signed in the Belarusian capital Minsk in September has been repeatedly violated it offers the best chance possible to end months of fighting that has killed more than 4,000 people, Frank-Walter Steinmeier said after talks in Moscow.
“It would be a huge loss to reject that document,” Steinmeier said.
He made a similar point in Kiev earlier in the day, saying that “Minsk remains a reference point, and that’s why I call for us to keep working on the implementation of the Minsk protocol.”
Steinmeier argued that it’s necessary to “give a new impulse” to the Minsk agreement. He said that the parties are close to reaching an agreement on the line of division, adding that once it’s done the warring sides could proceed with the next step under the Minsk deal and start pulling heavy artillery back from the frontline.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke in support of quickly drawing the line of division.
The Minsk protocol failed to produce a clear line of division and fighting has continued to rage around the main rebel-held city of Donetsk and other strategic areas as both warring sides have sought to extend their gains.
Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of violating the deal by continuing to back the rebels with troops and weapons and supporting regional elections held by the insurgents. Moscow denies those allegations.
“We call on Russia to pull back its forces from eastern Ukraine and to respect the Minsk agreements,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday.
Speaking in London, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said “Russia has to be consistently reminded of its obligations under the Minsk protocol,” adding that the EU “will continue to apply pressure to Russia until it complies with those obligations.”

In MP  132 women sterilised in 5hoursPrint
Written by Milind Ghatwai | Lucknow | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:37 am
Days after the sterilisation horror in neighbouring Chhattisgarh was reported, as many as 132 women Saturday underwent laparascopic tubectomy in just five hours at a government camp in a Community Health Centre in Ghuvara, which falls under Madhya Pradesh’s Chhatarpur district.
Fortunately, no complications have been reported from Ghuvara so far. Local media reports, however, suggested that the high number of surgeries, most of which were conducted well into the night and some after midnight, were carried out despite lack of proper arrangements at the health centre. Beneficiaries were reportedly carried by ward boys due to lack of stretchers. They were made to lie on the floor as the health centre did not have enough beds or blankets. Reportedly, over 50 women were sent away from the camp after the authorities realised they could not cope with the rush.
The allegations spurred the government on Monday to issue a new protocol restricting the number of surgeries in one camp to below 35.
Chhatarpur CMHO Dr V K Gupta, who visited some of the beneficiaries on Tuesday, denied the allegations and claimed that none of women had developed any complication or suffered infection. He admitted that the surgeries began late but added that it was not uncommon for such camps to go on well into the night.

Three petitions seeking a stay on the dastarbandi ceremony (anointment) for the son of Jama Masjid’s “Shahi Imam” Ahmed Bukhari as the “deputy” or naib Imam have been filed before the Delhi High Court.
The Imam of India’s largest mosque had recently roused controversy by announcing that his 19-year-old son would be appointed the deputy imam and had later said that the dastarbandi was a “private religious ceremony”.
Alleging that the post of an imam cannot be hereditary under Islam or under Indian law, the pleas state that Imam Bukhari is an “appointee” of the Waqf Board and cannot be allowed to appoint his own successor.
Further, the pleas claim that the post of the Naib Imam is also under the authority of the Waqf Board and cannot be claimed by any person.
A PIL has been filed by Old Delhi resident and businessman Suhail Ahmed Khan, who has previously filed petitions alleging “illegal” construction inside the Jama Masjid premises and has sought action against the Imam. Another PIL has been filed by advocate V K Anand, who has claimed that under the Waqf Board rules, the “Naib Imam post is a public post”.
A third is an intervention application filed by the NGO United Front for Protection and Welfare of Auqaf, filed through advocate Saif Mehmood, who has stated that the appointment and the function organised by Imam Bukhari was “an open challenge to the statutory authority of the Waqf Board, as the Waqf Board was the statutory authority” with the power to appoint remove or transfer an imam.
The plea filed by Suhail Khan has also sought a CBI investigation into allegation of financial mismanagement against Bukhari, claiming that he and his family had “profited” from the Jama Masjid, and had “illegally occupied” space inside the Masjid premises as residence.
The pleas also claim that the title of “Shahi Imam” could not be used by Bukhari, as the title was “void” after the collapse of the Mughal Monarchy in India.
The controversy over the appointment of the “Naib Imam” had erupted after Imam Bukhari announced that his 19 year old son would be placed as the “Naib Imam” and the dastarbandi ceremony would take place on November 22. The PILs are scheduled to be heard by the court on Wednesday.

Telework abuse hearing: Its stealing from the American peopleBy Lisa Rein November 18 Follow @Reinlwapo
A former U.S. Attorney now on the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday chastised the government’s top patent official for failing to fire or severely discipline most patent examiners who have been found to have committed time and attendance fraud.
“It’s theft,” Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.), a former federal prosecutor, told patent commissioner Margaret Focarino at the hearing before two House committees.
“It’s stealing from the American people,” Marino said of misconduct that was the subject of an internal review last year. “But these people are still working. Why?”
Focarino said some patent examiners who were paid for time they didn’t work and received overtime and bonuses after gaming the system were suspended, some fired, others reassigned and still others reprimanded.
“Any active misconduct related to time and attendance is unacceptable,” Focarino said several times under questioning by Marino. “We take action and administer the appropriate discipline.”
Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, asked the agency’s inspector general to assess whether the patent office has a “culture [of abuse]” or a series of “aberrations.”
Inspector General Todd Zinser replied, “There is a cultural issue. Supervisors do not want to investigate time and attendance abuse to the point they’re going to pursue records” that could prove “misconduct.”

Asian stock markets were lackluster Wednesday as investors digested a fall in Chinese home prices and Japan's scramble to overcome its economic malaise.
KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 was little changed at 17,347.76. It gained 2.2 percent the day before on news the government had delayed a second sales tax hike in response to the world's third-largest economy slipping into recession. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.3 percent to 23,469.31 and China's Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.2 percent to 2,451.23. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.5 percent to 5,374.80. Markets rose in Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia. Benchmarks in South Korea and Thailand fell.
JAPAN ECONOMY: After shelving a tax increase planned for next year, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called a snap election for December to renew the mandate for his all-or-nothing "Abenomics" effort to end Japan's two decades of economic stagnation. The economy's slide into recession after April's sales tax hike has underscored its fragility even as the government and Bank of Japan carry out unprecedented stimulus efforts.
THE QUOTE: "There is growing condemnation of Abenomics and whether its stated goals are achievable and whether the policy settings are correct," said Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne, Australia. "I remain convinced that whatever the outcome of the election, the BOJ will continue and even increase its stimulus program as will any Japanese government  and, in turn, that will push equities higher."
CHINA PROPERTY: Further softening in China's property prices has pushed down stocks linked to iron ore, copper and steel. In October, house prices contracted in 69 of 70 cities tracked by the government and the drop overall was 2.6 percent, figures released Monday showed. As property is a significant driver of growth in China, the weakness suggests its economic growth will continue to slow from the 7.3 percent recorded last quarter.
WALL STREET: Investors remained in a record-setting mood Tuesday, edging the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 to their latest all-time highs. The S&P 500 added 10.48 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,051.80. Its previous closing high was set Monday. The Dow rose 40.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,687.82. The Nasdaq composite gained 31.44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,702.44.
ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude was down 28 cents to $74.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell $1.03 to close at $74.61 on Tuesday. Brent crude was up 10 cents at $78.57 in London.
CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 117.26 yen from 117.12 yen late Tuesday. The euro fell to $1.2516 from $1.2523.

Stability of Fadnavis govt not our responsibility:NCPPrint
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:51 am
A day after the BJP took the initiative to reopen talks with the Shiv Sena to try and bring on board its erstwhile ally, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who had offered unconditional support to the ruling party after last month’s polls, put the government on notice by predicting the possibility of mid-term polls in Maharashtra.
At a two-day NCP conclave which began on Tuesday at Alibaug, Pawar told party workers to gear up for mid-term elections in the state. Adopting an aggressive posture against the BJP, he said that ensuring the stability of the Maharashtra government is not NCP’s responsibility.
The NCP had until now defended its stand on offering unconditional support to the BJP government saying that it wanted to provide stability in the larger interest of the state.
The change in stance is viewed in political circles as another political ploy by Pawar to reassert the significance of his party in state politics. A former cabinet minister from the NCP, who is part of the core group, told The Indian Express that  Pawar’s master stroke at the conclave was to defuse the growing unrest within the organisation following his offer to the BJP. Also, it comes at a time when Pawar reckons that there is a strong prospect of the Sena giving its nod to join the BJP led government in Maharashtra, he said.
Given the latest developments involving the BJP and the Sena, Pawar wants to seize the opposition space for the NCP instead of the Congress, which was more belligerent after the vote of confidence. Pawar also realises that a Sena-BJP alliance would spell fresh trouble as the BJP-led government may take the alleged corruption cases against some NCP ministers in the previous government to the logical end.
Taking the combined strength of the BJP (121) and the Sena (63) would make for a comfortable tally of 184 in the 288-member Assembly. The NCP, which has 41 members, reckons it would be redundant if the Sena joins the BJP. The Congress (42) has taken on the mantle of the Opposition party in the state.
The BJP does not appear to be fazed by the NCP’s veiled threat. BJP leaders said that the party did not take support from the NCP during the  trust vote in the Assembly on November 12. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “The people of Maharashtra have voted for my government for five years. The government is stable. We are confident of completing our full tenure and fulfilling the aspirations of the people across Maharashtra.”
Fadnavis also reiterated, “BJP will always welcome Shiv Sena in government.”
Sena president Uddhav Thackeray also chided Pawar saying that he says one thing and does another. “He never walks the talk,” Uddhav said.

Mamata invites Pranab for industrymeetPrint

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee met President Pranab Mukherjee Tuesday evening to invite him for an industry meet in the state in January. She earlier invited Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for the event when she visited him on Monday evening.
“I have invited Arunji because he is the Finance Minister of the country. I am meeting the President to invite him for BengalLeads. Investors from across the world will come to the event,” Banerjee said. She also met home minister Rajnath Singh in what Trinamool sources described as a “courtesy visit”.
She, however, gave the international conference on Jawaharlal Nehru organised by the Congress a miss. Tuesday was the second and the last day of the conference. During an informal interaction with journalists, Banerjee made light of the Swachh Bharat Mission and the Adarsh Gram scheme under which MPs are adopting villages as a “rehash of old schemes”.

Keystone XL is getting its day in Congress. But it needs to win at the state level  too.By Jaime Fuller November 18 Follow @j_fuller

The Senate is set to vote on the Keystone XL pipeline for the first time on Tuesday, but the debate over what the construction and oil production could mean for the states where it will run through has gone on for years and years -- as has the federal regulatory process assessing whether the pipeline should cross all the way to Canada.
Here's a quick round-up about what's been happening along the pipeline's proposed path -- from supporters and opponents.
Texas and Oklahoma
In Texas, the question of whether the pipeline will be built is moot. It's already there. The Gulf Coast pipeline -- which makes up 40 percent of Keystone XL's proposed path -- is already transporting oil from Texas to the southern edge of Nebraska. The big battle now is only over the northern half of the pipeline, which would go from Nebraska to Alberta, Canada.
The protests over the portion of the pipeline in Texas look a lot like the ones that have continued in Nebraska and in Washington, D.C.: Landowners worried about the pipeline going across their property , and climate activists worried about the environmental impact of transporting the tar sands. Farmers fought eminent domain rulings , activists protested in trees and were sometimes pepper sprayed .
The pipeline was built regardless, and began production earlier this year .
Politicians frequently mentioned the jobs created by the pipeline and Texas's energy boom on the campaign trail. Greg Abbott, who won the gubernatorial election in a landslide, said in a campaign ad , "Unleash our oil and gas industry. Together we'll keep Texas No. 1 in jobs."
Oil companies have been eager to tout success too. A study commissioned by the Consumer Energy Alliance -- a group of energy companies and producers -- said that TransCanada was spending millions  every month on local businesses in Texas and Oklahoma while working on the pipeline.
Some of the homeowners who allowed the pipeline to go through their yards have had less than glowing things to say about it, per this report from the Texas Observer. 
The current debate will have a negligible impact on the states where the pipeline is already working -- i.e.  no more construction jobs , but plenty of activists checking to see if the pipeline problems they predicted are happening.The Oklahoman reported on Monday , "Nature already has reclaimed much the land around Cushing where the pipelines went into the ground, although areas cleared of trees still reveal its location. 'Once you get a pipeline in, you pretty well forget about it,' the Davenport resident said."
Nebraska
Even if the Keystone XL bill manages to get through the Senate and the White House, there's no guarantee that TransCanada would be able to finish the pipeline anytime soon, -- thanks, that is, to a court case in Nebraska that has gone on for months. Landowners have challenged the proposed path of the pipeline , which would send the oil through private property thanks to eminent domain and the laws that let the state's executives approve it. The landowners were represented by Dave Domina , a Democrat who recently lost a U.S. Senate election against Republican Senator-elect Ben Sasse.
A Nebraska district court judge ruled in favor of the landowners , saying that the governor was not allowed to approve pipeline routes before a review from the Nebraska Public Service Commission, which also regulates taxis and obscure farming-related things. The Nebraska Supreme Court is set to announce its decision on the matter soon. If the Supreme Court decides that the Nebraska Public Service Commission does need to review the pipeline's route, that means months and months more review before anything can move forward with the pipeline. 
Bold Nebraska is one of the most visible groups protesting the pipeline's expansion.
The State Department is still in the middle of its review of the pipeline too. And even if the Nebraska case rules in favor of the governor's plan to expedite the pipeline construction schedule, everyone is waiting on this years-long review too.
South Dakota and Montana
A activists from a Native American tribe in South Dakota have been in D.C. this week protesting against supporters of the Keystone XL pipeline bill in the Senate. They stood outside Sen. Mary Landrieu's (D-La.) house next to an inflatable pipeline and have called on Congress to call the proposed construction "an act of war," per the Guardian.  This tribe -- and many others along the proposed pipeline route -- joined landowners and other anti-Keystone XL activists in D.C. this spring for a protest planned by the Cowboy Indian Alliance .
Meanwhile, TransCanada has complained  that the long wait for regulatory reviews and political battles has significantly increased the cost of building the pipeline in South Dakota. So much time has passed since the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission first approved the pipeline's route in 2010 that they need to re-approve the plan. 
In Montana, opposition to the pipeline has been far quieter. Al Jazeera reported in early November ,
“If you’re opposed to the Keystone in Montana, you’re painted as a radical,” says Kyla Maki, the clean energy program director of the Montana Environmental Information Center. “The final decision on the pipeline isn’t going to be made in Montana.
The debate over the pipeline is basically a more muted version of the one playing elsewhere. Plenty of small towns in Montana are looking forward to the possibility of construction jobs, as did many towns in Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska. However, there are plenty of landowners  who have been hesitant to allow pipelines to go through their property. Montana Sen. Jon Tester (D) has signaled support for the bill.

Telework abuse hearing: Focarino points to changesBy Lisa Rein November 18 Follow @Reinlwapo
Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) on Tuesday asked the government’s top patent official why the practice of allowing patent examiners to wait until the end of the quarter to submit most of their work “does not cast a red flag.”
“I’m concerned that this compromises the quality of work,” Collins told patent commissioner Margaret Focarino at a joint House hearing on reports of time and attendance fraud and other fraudulent practices found last year by an internal review team.
“Anybody in this room that’s ever had a college class knows that this can be a problem,” Collins said. “It’s  a pattern at the end of every quarter. It’s not a once-all thing. I’m very frustrated by this.”
But Focarino defended the practice known as end-loading. “It’s not necessarily a problem,” she said.
Collins asked her to explain how she could be so sure when 70 percent of supervisors who were interviewed by the review team said they were concerned that compressing work into a few days jeopardizes the quality of patent examinations.
“We are concerned that our supervisors believe that,” Focarino said.
She said the patent office is expanded a successful pilot program that requires supervisors to speak with examiners when they fail to space out their reviews over a quarter.
 

Relief for infra projects as CM okays new appraisalteamSEAC-2 committee appraises infrastructure projects in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region for environment clearances.
Written by Anjali Lukose | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:58 am
With Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis okaying the reconstruction of the State Expert Appraisal Committee-2 (SEAC-2), it could spell relief for projects stuck for want of a new panel for the past four months. The SEAC-2 committee appraises infrastructure projects in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) for environment clearances.
Around 400 projects were stuck until September as the tenure of SEAC-2 committee members ended in July, after which no committee was constituted at the state level. The state environment department on Tuesday finally approved a set of committee members, following the chief minister’s nod. It will now send its recommendations to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF).
“We have recommended six names for SEAC-2 committee and have sent it for approval to MoEF,” said Medha Gadgil, additional chief secretary, environment.
According to the state environment department, until September, around 170 new proposals were awaiting appraisal, while 225 were to be reviewed again by SEAC-2 after compliance and violation-related issues were resolved. These projects not only pertain to real estate development but also to information technology parks, commercial hubs, college expansion and hospital revamp plans, which have been pending before SEAC-2 that last met on June 27.
The SEAC-2 committee, after appraisal, recommends the projects, either for approval or rejection, to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA).
The state environment department officials, however, assured that the number of pending projects had “reduced drastically” from the September figures. “The number of pending proposals has reduced drastically now as several project proponents sought appraisal from a union committee for their pending projects in MMR,” said an official from the environment department, who added that the department did not have the current number of pending proposals.
Between July and October 18, around 21 projects from MMR were appraised by MoEF’s appraisal panel, according to the minutes of the meetings. Further, 15 MMR proposals will be appraised by the union committee on November 26, including two projects by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for “finalisation of terms of reference” for a multi-nodal corridor from Navghar to Chirner (near JNPT) and another proposal to construct an integrated water supply scheme for bulk water supply to the western sub-region of MMR, among other residential projects.

Ready to be a strong Opposition: ShivSenaPrint
Written by Zeeshan Shaikh | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:56 am
Hours after NCP chief Sharad Pawar expressed doubts on Tuesday about the survival of the new BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray only sought to stoke the fears of instability, saying his party would stay in Opposition for now.
“There is tremendous instability in Maharashtra as of now. Until this situation clears up, the Shiv Sena will sit in the Opposition,” Thackeray told reporters on the sidelines of a function at a city hospital. In an obvious reference to BJP and NCP, Thackeray said the dalliances between former political ideological foes had greatly upset the people in the state.
“The people are very upset with these dalliances. God forbid if elections are called again, this frustration will be expressed through the ballot,” Thackeray said. The Sena president, however, left the question of a possible rapprochement with former ally BJP open. “The Sena has not taken a decision so far,” Thackeray said.

As Ferguson waits  some lessons from the Rodney King riotsBy Radley Balko November 18 Follow @radleybalko

I  wrote a post last August about how the manner and approach that police agencies employ in response to protest can have a big impact on how whether or not protesters turn violent. In short, if the police go in anticipating violence, that anticipation can become self-fulfilling. I quoted law enforcement officials in the piece who have studied or had extensive experience in handling protests. They say police commanders should condition cops to see themselves as the facilitators of a protest, not the force that’s there to contain it. They should avoid arbitrary deadlines and restrictions, and while they should be prepared in case things get out of hand, they should keep the riot squads, military equipment, and cops in Robocop gear out of view.
In  my book on police militarization , I looked at the Rodney King riots, in particular how law enforcement officials’ approach to verdict in San Diego differed from the approach in Los Angeles. I think there are some lessons here, although it’s probably too late to apply them in Ferguson now. The passages below are from an earlier draft of my book, so they’ll include more context and detail than appeared in the final copy.
First, some context: Going back to the late 1980s, San Diego police officers had been involved in a number of racially-charged incidents that inflamed tensions with the city’s black community.
On April 11, the DA found “legitimate cause to question the conduct and testimony” of police officers in the case of Sagon Penn. In 1985, Penn, then a 23-year-old who had ambitions to become a police officer, was pulled over by San Diego police officers Donovan Jacobs and Thomas Riggs. Witnesses would later confirmed that Penn and Jacobs began to argue about Penn’s driver’s license. At some point, Jacobs physically confronted the 23-year-old Penn, threw him to the ground, and began beating him while spewing racial epithets. (Jacobs had been disciplined in the past for racist outbursts, though that information was initially kept from Penn’s lawyers.) Penn, a martial arts student, eventually overcame Jacobs, wrested his gun away from him, and shot the officer. He then shot Riggs, a citizien in the back of the squad car on a ride-along, and then fled in the officers’ own car. Riggs died, Jacobs and the woman in the squad car survived, but suffered permanent injuries. Two juries later acquitted acquitted Penn of murder and of attempted murder, finding that he acted in self-defense.
The DA issued another report, this time calling the death of 25-year-old Chip Doonan “a needless tragedy.” Before his death, Doonan had complained to friends that several San Diego police officers had been harassing him, including spying on him while off duty, and twice arresting him on drug charges that were later dropped due to lack of evidence. One officer in particular, Richard Draper, had made both arrests, and had also pulled Doonan over three times—all within a few months.
In January 1988, police had their fatal confrontation with Doonan, this time as he was moving his belongings into the garage of a friend, who had invited Doonan to live with him. Two officers chased Doonan around to the back of the garage, then shot him dead. The officers said they killed him because Doonan refused to obey an order to drop the weapon he was carrying, which turned out to be a BB gun. But one resident of the house who said he was eight feet away at the time Doonan was shot said he never heard police say anything, much less identify themselves. Four months later, Draper was dismissed from the department after pistol-whipping a college student while off duty. Draper claimed the student had cut him off on the interstate, so he tailgated the student’s truck. When the student tried to relent and let Draper pass, he says Draper continued the aggressive driving. The student eventually became frightened, and tried to get away. Draper chased him for miles at speeds over 100 mph, then finally cut him off at a red light, at which point he drew his gun, ordered the student out of his truck, beat him with his pistol, ripped off the student’s shirt, then threw him to the ground and arrested him.
Draper was hired by the San Diego Police Department in 1978 after being rejected by three other police departments. Over the course of his 10-year career he had been involved in three shootings (including one fatality), and was named in 20 citizen complaints of excessive force.
At around the same time, the department had been involved in a series of botched drug raids, mostly on black people. That included a 1987 raid that ended with police shooting and killing Tommy DuBose the father of the man they were looking for. Others in the home in the time say DuBose thought he was being robbed; he was in fact an outspoken critic of drug use, because of what he’d seen happen to his son. Longtime police officer and future chief of the Seattle Police Department Norm Stamper says the incident changed the way he looked at the drug war and police militarization. As I write in the book:
Drugs weren’t directly a factor in the Doonan or Penn confrontations. Both were incidents in which a confrontation between a citizen and police had unnecessarily escalated, with a tragic result. The same could be said about many of the incidents involving officers Garcia and Draper. And in all fairness, police officers in San Diego had good reason to be tense. During one stretch of the 1980s, the city lost 10 officers in eight years to on-the-job homicides, the highest mortality rate in the country. The aggression went both ways. And that wasn’t just in San Diego. Stamper illustrates the tension in his book Breaking Rank with two incredible quotes to open his chapter on police and race relations. The first is from a black woman, who was speaking at a San Diego community forum on police abuse:
Momma and Daddy were lucky they had girls. I had boys. My boys are eleven and nine now, and I’m scared to death for them. It’s not that I’m afraid they’re gonna get jumped into a gang, or wind up doing or dealing drugs. No sir. My big fear is that they’re gonna run into one of you people one night and they won’t be coming home. It’s like an open season on young black men in our community, like they’re walking around with targets on their backs. I have a recurring nightmare, Chief: I get this call in the middle of the night, “Come on down to the morgue, Mrs. Johnson. We got one of your boys, here. Police shot him when he tried to run.”
And from the white cop serving on a task force to improve officer safety, also in San Diego. He said this two weeks after the quote above:
It’s open season on us in The Heights, Chief. I fyou’re working the blacks you’re wearing a target, plain and simple. For me it comes down to this: kill or be killed. I got a wife and two boys. My sons need their father. I’m gonna do whatever it takes to make it home at the end of the shift.
The striking thing about the two quotes is how similar they are to the relationship between opposing soldiers in a war. The warring governments that send soldiers off to fight may well have nothing in common at all, just as, say, the leaders of civil rights organizations’ interests might diverge sharply from the interests of a mayor or police chief. But on the ground, where the casualties are, the opponents share a common humanity—they want to survive, they want to stop living and working in fear, they think often about their families.
In just the handful of examples above from San Diego, it isn’t at all difficult to see how the animosity could pick up momentum. The minority community looks at Tommy Dubose and sees cops busting into a family’s home, then gunning down an unarmed man in his own living room. They see an outspokenly anti-drug father killed in front of his family because the police, at least as they see it, had no problem punishing the father for the crimes of his son. They see that though everyone acknowledges Tommie DeBose was innocent, his innocence doesn’t matter. There are no criminal charges, no disciplinary action, not a single day of suspension. They see that two years later, the cops are wearing the same vests that the DA’s report concluded had contributed to Dubose’s death in the first place. They see vague promises to make sure nothing similar happens again, followed by more botched raids. They read about repeat police offenders like Garcia and Draper. And when these things happen, they hear police spokesmen like Gore and Berglund and Burgreen explain that yes the cops may have hit the wrong house; or yes an innocent man is dead; or yes it turns out that this particular cop had prior problems with excessive force . . . . but technically that address was correct; or you can’t blame the cop for fearing for his life even though the man was unarmed; or the cops did everything correctly except they accidentally raided the wrong address; or sure this cop history of shootings or citizen complaints well above the standard deviation, but we have to judge these incidents one at a time, on their own merits, not cumulatively.
After a while, whether intentional or not, an unmistakable message emerges: Our policies are more important than you people. When police officials appear to spend more creative energy making excuses than figuring out ways to prevent tragedies they claim were unintentional from happening again, the message to communities disproportionately effected by the policies that create this incidents is that the people in those communities are expendable.
It isn’t difficult to imagine, then, what might be going through the mind of a young black man like Sagon Penn when he’s pulled over, when the cop begins to get aggressive, lets loose with a few racial slurs, then begins to get physical. He’s thinking about every story he’s read or heard about a young black men who ended up dead after an interaction with the police.
But you can see a cop’s point of view, too. He hears about Sagon Penn and he thinks about every other young black kid who has given him lip during a traffic stop or a Terry stop. Sure, maybe he wouldn’t have gotten physical with the kid, or used the racial slurs, but he can certainly see how his colleague could get fed up with that sort of thing after a bad day, or at the end of his shift. And for that, this kid kills a cop, maims another, shoots a citizen, steals a squad car, and runs over one of the cops he just shot as he speeds away. After hearing that story, it isn’t difficult to imagine why a cop in San Diego would be more on guard, more wary, more distrustful, and quicker to reach for his gun the next time he was face to face with a young black kid in a bad neighborhood.
The really depressing thing about that passage is the events described in it occurred in 1987. There are far too many places in America where it’s just as applicable now, nearly three decades later.
The good news is that things got better in San Diego, at least for a while. And that’s because the police and the city made a concerted effort to shift to more  community-oriented policing. The policies were largely due to the effort of Norm Stamper, who by then had reason to the upper ranks of the city’s police force.
Penn’s case, along with that of Dooney and Dubose moved the city to take extraordinary efforts to move to more community-oriented policing, particularly with minority outreach. By the early 1990s, San Diego police officials and city leaders were in regular contact with civil rights and minority leaders. The city set up a hotline to report police abuse, and persuaded a local TV station to host a telethon in which viewers could call in to have on-air conversations with city leaders.
In a 1992 article, the Los Angeles Times later credited those efforts for saving San Diego from the rioting that took place in Los Angeles after the King verdict came down.
“The Sagon Penn case was the low point in the relationship between the police and the community,” said City Manager Jack McGrory. “It was San Diego’s Rodney King case. It was symbolic of the troubles within the Police Department in terms of the attitudes of our officers. We knew we had to change, to break down the walls between government and the community.”
Changes since the Penn trial include a civilian police review board, a more restrained policy on the use of deadly force, greater use of officers walking beats in poor and minority neighborhoods, and community-oriented policing, where officers are ordered to leave their squad cars, mix with residents and respond to their complaints.
Milton Silverman, Penn’s defense attorney, said the outcome of the Penn trial aided San Diego in two ways: First by showing that blacks can get justice in San Diego, and second by the police reforms it wrought. Both, he says, saved San Diego during the Los Angeles riots.
“I think it kept the city from burning down,” Silverman said.
Frank Jordan, president of the San Diego chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, agrees. “We’ve already had our Rodney King,” he said. “Without Sagon Penn, or if he hadn’t been able to get justice, then things could have been very explosive in San Diego (after the King trial verdict).”
Ellis, once a critic of the Police Department, also sees a significant shift. “Some things have been going on for at least the last four years to establish a new dialogue between law enforcement, City Hall and the community,” he said.
After the verdict, those goodwill gestures and the relationships they built paid off.
City and police officials in San Diego were quick to denounce the acquittal of the LAPD officers who beat Rodney King, but more importantly, they had direct lines to the city’s minority communities when the verdict was announced. They could build a strategy around empathy, not antagonism. Consequently, city officials knew that angry people would want to vent. So rather than suppress demonstrations, they allowed them—nearly encouraged them.
They then sent police officers out into city’s minority neighborhoods. City officials later acknowledged that this was to prevent the protests from getting out of hand and turning violent. But because of the city’s embrace of true community, dispatching cops to their beat en masse looked more like a show of support than a show of force. The cops knew the neighborhoods they were sent out to keep calm, and not just the street grids and landmarks, but the pastors, the school principals, and the community leaders. One local activist told the Times, “One of the reasons we survived is that people from the mayor to the City Council to the arts organizations got out into the streets immediately and sided with the people, not against them.”
. . . Interestingly, since the late 1980s, San Diego has also boasted one of the lowest crime rates in the country. It consistently ranks among the five safest big cities in America. Crime in the city has been falling for the last two decades, just as it has in the rest of the country,. But San Diego’s crime rate peaked in 1989, just as the new policies were taking hold in the city. The national crime rate peaked in 1991.
Stamper would go on to make national headlines as the man in charge during the 1999 WTO riots and subsequent police crackdown. Today, Stamper says his decision to use that sort of force on the WTO protesters — which stands in contrast to nearly everything else he did in law enforcement — was the biggest mistake of his career.
As for San Diego, the city’s police department has recently been embroiled in some scandal and questionable use of force incidents . But it’s still consistently one of the safest big cities in the country.

On face-offs and behind the net  Caps allowing free goalsBy Alex Prewitt November 18 Follow @alex_prewitt

GLENDALE, Ariz. – The unpredictability of his inaugural season helming the Washington Capitals had vexed Barry Trotz through 17 games and now, one day before the 18th, it left him searching for the proper phrase to describe the recent spat of mistakes. “That’s been a little bit of a sense of concern…frustration…I don’t have the right word,” he said. “It seems to be an effect on the game that doesn’t need to be an effect on the game.”
More specifically, Trotz was pondering the prior weekend, when the Capitals lost to New Jersey, 1-0, on a goaltending gaffe and then lost to St. Louis, 4-2, on a night that pivoted by a similar error and another goal coming from a lost face-off. He  lauded the macrocosmic advances of his players since overtaking the job, in tangible categories such as puck possession, and intangible ones such as culture. But, with a 7-7-3 record carried into mid-November, the team also felt like five of those seven regulation losses should have, at least, resulted in single standings points.
“There’s been so much progress in so many other areas, but we’re not getting the results we need, and that’s been a little bit of the frustration because of draw plays, because of goaltender miscues, stuff like that,” Trotz said.
So first, on the puck-handling blunders by netminders Braden Holtby and Justin Peters. At Verizon Center against the Devils , Holtby took too long making his read behind the net. He saw teammate Marcus Johansson up the ice and tried to play the puck along the boards. Instead, New Jersey forward Jaromir Jagr circled by and tapped Holtby’s stick. The pass skirted to Mike Cammalleri, who had cut in front of Johansson, and wound up inside an empty net.
The next night, with the Capitals fighting an uphill battle against the scorching Blues , down 2-1 entering the third period, Peters committed a similar mistake. He mishandled the puck behind the Capitals net, waiting a split second too long and, instead of finding a teammate, found St. Louis captain David Backes.
“Those have to be eliminated,” Trotz said. “The goalies, last game, at crucial times in the game, a 0-0 game and a 2-1 game, made a massive mistake, which ultimately, in the one game cost us the game and in the other one put us into a 2-1, having some momentum from the second period, then taking that momentum away from us against a very good St. Louis team . Those have to stop.”
Later, still answering the same question about takeaways from the weekend, Trotz voluntarily returned to Holtby and Peters.
“That’s got to stop,” he said again. “We’ve got to stop that if we’re going to do anything going forward here. It really deflates your bench when that happens. I don’t think I’ve had as blatant a goaltender mishandles, we’ve had two of those, I can maybe remember one a year, not back to back games, ever.”
If Monday morning at Gila River Arena seemed like Groundhog Day, previous replies from Trotz repeated, he only added to the feeling when discussing St. Louis’ second goal, which came off a lost draw by forward Eric Fehr in the defensive zone. The puck moved fast from the dot, back to Carl Gunnarsson then across the ice to Kevin Shattenkirk. Peters saved Shattenkirk’s initial point shot. But Schwartz boxed out defenseman Karl Alzner and slammed down the rebound.
“How many draw goals have we given up this year off the face-offs?” Trotz asked, roughly the same sentiment expressed in Saturday’s aftermath. “I sort of get that. We’re young in the middle and that’s not a strength for our group is the draws, but we’ve got to get those tied up, or a block or a save. Those goals are too reoccurring for us right now. That’s not good enough. At the same time, we can be better. I thought the New Jersey game, we deserved to get a point that game, and we didn’t. And that’s happened a few times this year.”
Three times in the past four games and fifth overall this season, in fact, as fellow beat writer Adam Vingan noted . Each goal resulted from a clean loss on the draw, traffic created near the net and the collective failure to block the shot or save it. Add these to the defensive zone turnovers that doomed the Capitals during their previous   five-game winless stretch , and the concern — or frustration — becomes apparent.
“I think in our game, a lot of times you have to set the puck up for the defenseman, and if you set it up, you can distribute it to someone,” Trotz said. “We have protocols for those situations, and everyone was in perfect position, then you have to execute the play. The plays didn’t get executed. That’s the bottom line. Both those cost us goals. This league is too tough and there’s too much parity to give up free goals.”

Lefty reliever Matt Grace is on the Nationals radarBy James Wagner November 18 Follow @jameswagnerwp

Matt Grace was a standout reliever at the UCLA on a pitching staff that included starters such as Gerrit Cole and Trevor Bauer, and fell just short of winning the national title. After the Nationals selected him in the eighth round of the 2010 draft, he was converted to a starting pitcher. His ERA was no lower than 4.84 in any of those first three seasons as a starter. It just wasn’t working.
“Starting was a struggle for me,” said Grace last week in Glendale before an Arizona Fall League game. “I thought I could do it but I wasn’t a very good starter. But it taught me a lot of stuff.”
The Nationals and Grace ditched starting completely in 2013, and he thrived again. Over the past two seasons, he jumped from Class A Potomac to Class AA Harrisburg and finished the 2014 campaign with Class AAA Syracuse. His combined ERA last season was 1.17 and he has risen up the depth chart, inching closer to the major leagues.
The Nationals can tweak their major league bullpen many ways this offseason. And if they choose to part ways with Ross Detwiler, who saw his stock fall throughout an up-and-down season, the Nationals have cheap in-house options such as Xavier Cedeno and, perhaps, even Grace behind him. The 25-year-old left-handed reliever has a good sinking fastball and developing breaking balls. He is an intriguing prospect.
“Hopefully I get an opportunity somewhere down the road,” Grace said. “It’s out of my hands. I control what I can control. All I can do is go pitch and execute pitches and get outs and those guys take care of that. If they need me, I’m ready to go. I feel like I’m ready to go. I feel like I could help out the team up there. That’s their decision, not mine.”
Grace has many things working in his favor. He is tough on left-handers; he held them to a .176 average at Harrisburg this season and then .113 average at Syracuse. He is effective against right-handers but not as well. He is durable; 29 of 50 appearances this season were multi-inning stints, many of them two-inning outings, so he has been used often against hitters from both sides of the plate. His walk rate increased this season (2.9 BB/9) but he rarely gives up home runs (only one in 77 innings) and has a nice strikeout rate (7.5 K/9 in 2013 and 7.2 K/9 in 2014) for a sinkerballer.
“Relieving, you just go after guys,” he said. “You don’t have to have this routine or think about setting people up or going three times through the order. You just go after people with your best stuff on any given day. And I like the opportunity to pitch every day, too. It wasn’t in my makeup. I’m happy being a reliever. It suits me personally.”
If Grace reaches the majors, it will be because of his fastball, evaluators say. He used it almost exclusively during the season, even against left-handed batters. The low 90s fastball has such heavy sink and life. “You can’t teach that,” one scout said.
But in order to reach that point, Grace has to keep working on his secondary pitches. Grace’s command of his slider and change-up have improved, and he was sent to the AFL to further develop both pitches. The Nationals wanted Grace to use his slider more as a “go-to” pitch that he can bounce in the dirt with two strikes for a punchout or use even when behind in the count.
“It’s gone well,” Grace said. “I’ve noticed a big difference in it. I’m throwing it more and it sets up my fastball better.”
The change-up to right-handed batters has also felt more comfortable, Grace admitted, but he knows he must use it more in games than before. One scout graded both pitches as average. Grace finished his time in the AFL well, using both pitches more and posting a 3.18 ERA in 11 1/3 innings. He may likely be in big league camp in the spring and looking to impress team officials. (The Nationals have several choices on their hands ahead of Thursday’s deadline to protect players before December’s Rule 5 draft, and Grace could be one of them.)
Grace has been used in a variety of roles as a reliever and, in the AFL, he pitched often in the seventh inning, with some work in the eighth inning. But just like his hopes of reaching the major leagues, he is willing to pitch whenever is needed.
“I just want a shot,” he said. “They can throw me whenever. It’s just about getting an opportunity and whenever they need me I’ll help out. I know the tag ‘left-handed specialist,’ no one really wants that, but it’s a job. It’s an opportunity. If that’s what they need, then that’s what they need.”

Some relationship advice for Charles Manson and his bride-to-be: Agree to disagreeIn this file photo, Charles Manson is escorted to his arraignment on conspiracy-murder charges in connection with the Sharon Tate murder case, 1969, Los Angeles. (AP Photo)
Weddings are usually stressful. Marriage, too.
Especially if your special day will begin in a prison. And if you are going to marry the mastermind of a mass murder, who seems kinda iffy about the whole thing. Plus he’s been married twice already.
We’re talking about one of our generation’s creepiest and most diabolical criminal minds Charles Manson, who is in the news again since the Associated Press reported on Monday that the 80-year-old bushy eyebrow-ed killer and his far younger bride-to-be, 26-year-old Afton Elaine Burton, a.k.a Star, applied for a marriage license on Nov. 7.
Although a wedding date hasn’t been set, Star said she and Manson will be married next month in Corcoran State Prison, a male-only facility. There’s a lake nearby, that could have made for a nice setting. But it’s bone-dry because of the California heat.
Afton Elaine Burton, the 26-year-old fiancee of Charles Manson who goes by the name "Star," claims Manson did not commit the mass murders he is imprisoned for. (AP)
The two will likely be wed in the cozy prison visiting room. No more than 10 guests will be permitted from the outside. An employee of the prison is their wedding planner, i.e. “a marriage coordinator,” who processes paperwork for an inmate’s request to be wed.
Manson was denied parole for the 12th time in 2012 for masterminding the ­ grisly 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate, who was pregnant at the time, along with six others.
Manson will be 92 if he lives to see his next scheduled parole hearing. But crime experts say he will never be released.
But Star doesn’t think that’s true. She’s spent the past nine years trying to help exonerate him.
“I do think this kind of relationship is way more common, but most inmates aren’t infamous,” said Janine Vaccarello, chief operating officer at the Crime Museum in downtown Washington. “I don’t know what the attraction is. If it’s individual people really believing they are innocent or being obsessed with the story. Sometimes we are not dealing with a full deck of cards.”
Burton wasn’t even born when Manson committed his crimes. And Tate’s sister, Debra, has already told the AP that the impending marriage is “ludicrous.”
“What would any young woman in her right mind want with an 80-year-old man,” she told the news agency.
“Our thoughts go out to the families of the victims,” Vaccarello said. “I’m sure they feel this is an undeserved privilege.”
Meanwhile we researched five pieces of advice for the somewhat preposterous long-distance couple, and here are the time-tested, pearls of wisdom we found:
1. Make the most of your time together.
The prison’s visiting-room rules allow a kiss at the beginning and end of each visit. Enjoy.
2. Don’t depend on the other person for your own happiness. Live your own life, too.
This may be hard since, “Manson’s soon to be wife claims she wants to marry him so she can have access to info that can help exonerate him,”  Vaccarello said. Star also runs his Facebook page . And Rolling Stone says she visits him for up to five hours a day on Saturday and Sundays, “assuming  he’s not in solitary or otherwise being hassled by the Man,” the article says.
3. Every couple is different.
Sure, John Wayne Gacy, also known as the killer clown and Ted Bundy, American serial killer , kidnapper, rapist, and necrophile, were both in committed relationships and the Night Stalker - Richard Ramirez was married just before being put to death. (By a woman who wrote him over 75 love letters.)But the woman Manson calls, “a star in the Milky Way!” will have to have know that their relationship is their own.
4. Only you know what you have.
So what if psychologists accuse you of having hybristophilia, o r a “Bonnie and Clyde syndrome,” which means you dig the rush of criminal acts and those who do them.
Katherine Ramsland , a professor of forensic psychology at DeSales University and director of the school’s masters of arts in criminal justice program, says she found out a few things by speaking with prison groupies, and researching them. She found that generally they fall in love with an idea.
“But this kind of love is never tested – she never has to do Manson’s laundry or pick up after him – so they can maintain that romantic glow,” she said. Or sometimes they gravitate to them,”because they were abused and that feels familiar,” or they want to be close to fame or “they see the little boy that the killer once was and seek to nurture him.”
The upsides: “She knows where he is at all times and he is not likely to cheat. And he’s not spending her money,” she said. “Who doesn’t want that?”
5. Agree to disagree
Enough said.

After 13 years  2 wars and trillions in military spending  terrorist attacks are rising sharplyBy Christopher Ingraham November 18 Follow @_cingraham
Last year saw the highest number of terrorist incidents since 2000, according to the latest Global Terrorism Index released by the Institute for Economics and Peace. Worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents increased from less than 1,500 in 2000 to nearly 10,000 in 2013. Sixty percent of attacks last year occurred in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria.
The report suggests that U.S. foreign policy has played a big role in making the problem worse: "The rise in terrorist activity coincided with the US invasion of Iraq," it concludes. "This created large power vacuums in the country allowing different factions to surface and become violent." Indeed, among the five countries accounting for the bulk of attacks, the U.S. has prosecuted lengthy ground wars in two (Iraq and Afghanistan), a drone campaign in one (Pakistan), and airstrikes in a fourth (Syria).
The report defines terrorism as  “the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.”
The U.S. will invest somewhere between $4 and 6 trillion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with untold additional resources spent on anti-terrorism efforts elsewhere, according to the Harvard Kennedy School of Government . While we haven't suffered any major terrorist attacks on U.S. soil since 9/11, the Global Terrorism Index numbers cast considerable doubt on whether that money's been well-spent. And they give some credence to the notion that our ham-handed foreign policy is actually a destabilizing factor in world affairs.
In other news, the Obama administration recently approved doubling the number of troops we currently have on the ground in Iraq.

Three southern states locked in waterdisputeWritten by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai | Posted: November 19, 2014 2:05 am
Tuesday saw major developments in dam disputes involving Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala.
Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary Mohan Verghese Chungath wrote to his Kerala counterpart, seeking action against Kerala MLA E S Bijimol, who allegedly led a group that attacked PWD engineers at the Mullaperiyar dam site. A few hours later, Chief Minister O Panneerselvam issued a statement on the state’s decision to move Supreme Court to stall Karnataka’s construction of two proposed dams across Cauvery river.
In May this year, the Supreme Court ruled that water up to 142 feet could be stored in the Mullaperiyar dam. A section of Kerala politicians, however, claim it is not safe for the 116-year-old dam to hold that much water. On Monday evening, a group led by CPI MLA Bijimol entered the dam site without permission. During the ensuing argument, journalists accompanying Bijmol reportedly manhandled officials.
Panneerselvam on Tuesday said the Mullaperiyar dispute was a ‘settled’ one. Meanwhile, officials and ministers visited the dam site to ensure safety of local residents. The Idukki district administration also issued statements that they were prepared to meet a critcal situation.
Notably, Kerala opposition leader V S Achuthanandan had last week urged the state government to seek SC intervention in the dispute after the water level crossed 136 feet, which Kerala claims  to be the ‘danger mark’. On Saturday, Kerala moved the apex court on the issue, while CM Oommen Chandy wrote to Paneerselvam for reducing the water level. In his reply, the Tamil Nadu CM said both states must follow the SC verdict.
Meanwhile, Tamil farmers from delta districts are protesting against Karnataka water resources minister M B Patil’s remark that the state plans to build two reservoirs across the Cauvery. CM Panneerselvam on Tuesday announced that his government is moving SC to seek a stay on these projects.
Coordinator of Cauvery Rights Retrieval committee explained that the dam projects would affect thousands of farmers in the region. “They are planning to build two dams near Megadatu, across the Cauvery river, to store 48 TMC of water. This will have a huge impact on our lives and eventually turn the delta districts into a desert,” he said.
Also, farmers from the southern districts of Tamil Nadu are opposing another dam project by Kerala, across Pambar river. The protesters say the project, if implemented, would have a huge impact on farm lands in Tirupur and Karur districts.

Operation will continue till Rampal is arrested  says Haryana topcopPrint

The operation to arrest Sant Rampal after flushing out his supporters from the Satlok Ashram in Haryana’s Hisar district began around 12:10pm on Tuesday following the directive of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. However, police failed to enter the Ashram premises despite a four-hour long operation during which the Ashram’s 20-feet-long boundary wall was breached. The operation was finally suspended midway owing to risk of explosion in an underground LPG dump in the area.
The stand-off left at least 105 police personnel and 85 followers of Sant Rampal injured. While two of the injured policemen received gunshot injuries, a woman follower of the Sant sustained burns. The injured were admitted to Hisar’s civil hospital and a few of them were discharged after first-aid. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar called an emergency meeting of officers and took stock of the situation.
Meanwhile, electricity, water and ration supply to the ashram remains cut-off. “Despite the fact that there were children inside, we had to take this step. All the roads leading to the ashram have been sealed. We shall not pull back till we capture Rampal”, said P K Mahapatra, Additional Chief Secretary (Home).
Haryana police chief S N Vashisht said the operation would continue till Rampal is arrested. “This morning, we received a phone call informing that a large number of followers were forcibly held hostage by Rampal’s ‘commandos’. The call’s authenticity was verified and it was found to be genuine. A case was also registered in this regard. During the operation, we provided safe passage to a large number of devotees and 10 buses filled with (the Sant’s) followers were dispatched from the Ashram to safe locations”.
While Vashisht claimed no casualty took place, Ashram spokesperson Raj Kapur said: “Eight bodies, including those of four women, are lying inside the ashram. Because of the barbaric action initiated by the police, innocent people have lost lives”. Vashisht refuted Kapur’s allegations. “We have ensured that no innocent is harmed. So far, no such casualty has come to our notice,” the DGP said.
At 1:20pm, the advancing policemen had to retreat in haste following a ‘warning’ from the Ashram. A voice blaring from loudspeakers said the Sant’s supporters were ready to shoot. “Hat jao. Aur paas aoge to goliyaan chalengi. Sat Guru Maharaj Rampal ki jai,” it said. Impeded by their own inability to shoot back, police retreated into the fields next to the ashram. However, they advanced again, amid loud explosions from teargas shells, gunshots, and crude bombs.
Senior police officers in charge of the operation told the Indian Express that it was proving difficult to advance because the Sant’s supporters had a “height advantage”. “It seems they have been preparing for this battle for a long time and have an endless supply of stones and bricks. All of this is coming down at us from the first and second floors of the ashram. Our tear gas cannot reach there, and because we are not firing back, our forces are finding it difficult to advance,” a continued…

As night descends on Barwala in Haryana’s Hisar district, an uneasy truce has been called. The supporters of “godman” Sant Rampal — many of them armed with guns and petrol bombs — are hunkered down in his ashram. Just across the narrow road, 4,000 security personnel are waiting. After waging a pitched battle for four hours, the two groups seem to have suspended operations till daybreak. The security personnel are waiting to arrest Rampal and produce him in court, while his followers are determined to stop them.

A little over 15 minutes into the truce, one of Rampal’s followers breaks ranks and walks. hesitatingly, towards the security barricade. As he steps over spent tear gas shells, broken bottles and stones, the security forces erupt in cheer. They applaud his every step. Police standing close to the ashram call out to others to follow suit. Minutes later, another man sneaks out of the ashram. This continues, till at least 60 have left the ashram.
“I came from Jaipur on November 7. Every day, they would ask us to stay at the ashram for one more day. In the last two days, they prevented us from leaving, and threatened that the police would kill us,” said Mani Ram, one of those who left.
All through Tuesday afternoon, security forces laid siege to the 12-acre ashram, forcibly removing supporters and tearing down walls and barricades with bulldozers. Rampal’s supporters retaliated with gunshots and crude fire bombs. A four-hour operation and several injuries later, Rampal was nowhere to be found. His supporters claimed he was never inside the ashram.

But Haryana DGP S N Vashisht said Rampal was still in the ashram. The ashram’s spokesperson, Raj Kapur, claimed otherwise. “Baba Rampal has already been shifted out of the ashram and is undergoing treatment in a private hospital outside the state,” he said.
At the Hisar railway station, at least 50 women, who were taken away from the ashram by the police earlier, are waiting. “We wanted to leave earlier but couldn’t. When the police came today, we were sitting outside the ashram. They picked us up. But I can’t leave because my husband and two children are inside. The women and children are being made to sit outside the ashram in shifts so that the police don’t attack.
The ashram people have purposely separated families to make it harder for us to leave. I will stay here until they come out safely,” said Laxmi, a resident of Gonda. The police have cordoned off the railway station.
Many women claimed the ashram officials had tried to prevent them from leaving. “I came for his satsang on November 7, but wanted to leave when the situation worsened. I wanted continued…

Small plane crashes into Chicago home  pilotkilledA small twin-engine cargo plane crashed into a Chicago home Tuesday, killing the pilot.
By: Associated Press | Chicago | Posted: November 19, 2014 2:22 am
A small twin-engine cargo plane crashed into a Chicago home Tuesday, killing the pilot but sparing a couple who were sleeping right next to where the plane hit.
The Aero Commander 500-B slammed nose-down into the front of the home at about 2:40 am, punching through the ground floor into the basement and leaving about a third of the aircraft, including the tail, sticking straight out of the red-brick home.
Both told first responders they were fine and refused any medical attention.
After stabilising the house, crews recovered the body from the wreckage. No one else was on board. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office did not immediately release the pilot’s name.
The pilot reported engine trouble shortly after taking off from Midway International Airport and asked to return to the airport. But the plane crashed about a quarter mile short of the runway, said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory.
Fire crews found aviation fuel leaking from the wreck but there was no fire or explosion, and the airframe was mostly intact, investigators said.
The NTSB expects to have a preliminary accident report within a week, followed by a final report in about a year.
The airport is closely bounded by densely populated neighborhoods. Those living near the crash site said the impact shook houses.
Luz Cazares, 62, who lives next door, ran to check on the neighbors she’s known for more than 20 years, fearing that the couple in their 80s did not survive.
She called out for them, jumped a fence and found them just inside the backdoor. The woman was asking, “What happened? What happened?” Cazares said.
She helped her to safety, while a police officer aided the woman’s husband.

Faster clearance  tougher penalty is new thrust in environmentlawThe Indian Environment Service is supposed to be a “high quality”, “environment-sensitive” specialised cadre that would man the new institutions that are proposed to be put in place.
Written by Amitabh Sinha | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 2:17 am
Proposing  a complete overhaul of the existing environmental governance framework, a government-appointed expert committee has recommended measures that would make it easier to set up industrial or infrastructure projects, but would also ensure that those who flout pollution norms or violate green laws are penalised heavily.
Among the measures suggested by the four-member committee headed by former Cabinet Secretary T S R Subramanian are: creation of new institutions — National Environment Management Agency (NEMA) and State Environment Management Agencies (SEMA), a new “All India Environment Service”, a “national laboratory” that will host a databank of all environmental parameters, and introduction of digital and “non-tamperable” methods of monitoring compliance.
It has also proposed a new law to give a legal framework to all these and strict punishment for defaulters. While a first offence would be punished with a heavy fine, a repeat offence would straightaway invite closure of the unit or project.
“The new environment protection regime needs to be backed by the right people, right laws, right technology and right knowledge,”
Subramanian told The Indian Express after his committee handed over its report to Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday.
The committee, also comprising former Environment Secretary Viswanath Anand, retired Delhi High Court Judge Justice A K Srivastav, and former Additional Solicitor General K N Bhat, was asked to review six environment-related laws with the aim of bringing them “in line with current requirements”.
Subramanian said as far as the approval and compliance mechanism (for environmental appraisal of projects) was concerned, the committee had placed its trust in the principle of “utmost good faith”. “The industry or the agency putting up the project can be allowed to certify its own assessments of the environmental impact and propose measures to mitigate these in an affidavit. The appraising agency, equipped with data and  technology, can accept these after proper verification. But once the clearance is awarded and the industry is found to be violating its own affidavit or any other rule or law, heavy penalties should be imposed immediately,” he said.
“Compliance and transparency is at the heart of the framework we are proposing,” he said.
The committee has also proposed the creation of a new “appellate court” which an industrial party can approach in case it is aggrieved by the appraisal and clearance process or imposition of penalties. It is proposed that this court should announce its verdict within three months.
The committee has called for a massive addition of capacities, both in terms of manpower and technology, to make the new system effective.

Catholic Diocese offers plan to settle abuseclaimPrint
By: Associated Press | Helena | Posted: November 19, 2014 2:12 am
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena has filed a bankruptcy reorganisation plan that proposes a $16.4 million settlement for hundreds of people who said clergy members sexually abused them for decades while the church covered it up.
The plan, filed late Monday, calls for the 362 victims identified in two lawsuits filed in 2011 to receive a minimum payment of $2,500 each. An abuse-claims reviewer will determine the actual payment based on the severity and long-term effects of the abuse. The plaintiffs’ attorneys, unsecured creditors and any future abuse claims also will be paid out of the trust.
“As attorneys for the victims, we are relieved that this long battle is finally coming to an end,” Seattle attorney Timothy Kosnoff wrote in an email to The Associated Press on November 14. He expected the plaintiffs to be paid early next year.
The plan calls for insurance companies to contribute $14.4 million to the trust, while the diocese is asking the court’s approval for a $3.5 million loan so it can contribute $2 million to the trust and cover administrative expenses and operating expenses.
The settlement was reached through mediation, but it still must be approved by the creditors, including the plaintiffs in the lawsuits who said they were abused from the 1940s to the 1970s.
Bishop George Leo Thomas expressed “his profound sorrow” and apologised to the victims in a news conference in January announcing the settlement.
“I know the pain is real, the pain is in the present tense, and in the name of the church, I want to say I’m sorry and we’re sorry as a church,” Thomas said at the time.
The plan also calls for a wrongful-discharge lawsuit filed by former Butte Central teacher Shaela Evenson to be allowed, with any judgment being subject to the limits of an insurance policy. Evenson sued after being fired from the Catholic school for being unmarried and pregnant. In March, she gave birth to a son, the first child for her and her partner, Marilyn Tobin.
The diocese issued a statement Tuesday saying it could not immediately comment on the plan, which does accept any liability for a 2012 lawsuit filed against the Ursuline Sisters of the Western Province.
The proposed $3.5 million loan from Placid Enterprises LLC would be secured by diocese-owned buildings including the bishop’s $367,000 residence, other property and Legendary Lodge, a church camp on Salmon Lake valued at $3.6 million.  The loan has a 5 percent interest rate and requires monthly payments of nearly $14,600 for five years.
The diocese said it was minimising expenses and, with increased donations, was confident it could successfully reorganise its finances, the filing said.
Helena’s diocese was the 11th in America to seek bankruptcy protection in the face of sex-abuse claims.

Accused were under orders to fire a 2nd time outside producer Moranis residence to create impact:CopsPrint
By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:07 am
The Mumbai Police Crime Branch’s investigations into the alleged plot to kill a city-based film producer-director have revealed that the accused had also been instructed to open fire outside the Juhu residence of producer Karim Morani for a second time.
From November 15 to 17, the crime branch arrested 13 people allegedly paid by a wanted fugitive. While 10 of them were allegedly part of the planning and execution of the murder of the producer-director, his brother or his son outside his office in Khar, three of the 10 accused, as well as three others, were allegedly found to be behind the firing outside Morani’s Juhu bungalow in August.
“The arrested accused revealed during interrogation that their paymaster had told them to fire shots outside Morani’s house after killing the producer-director to ‘reinforce the impact’. The order given to them was to kill the producer-director as the firing outside Morani’s residence did not have any effect, and then to repeat the firing to drive the message home,” said a crime branch officer.
On Tuesday, the crime branch recovered another country-made pistol and five live rounds from accused Sufian Dilshaad and Faiz Naeem, who had allegedly buried the arsenal in a garden in Nalasopara.
“The accused had obtained six pistols and several rounds of ammunition from a firearms dealer based in Madhya Pradesh for Rs 80,000.
This weapons’ racket seems to be highly organised. The dealer had even sent a replacement for one of the guns, which had turned out to be faulty. We are on the trail of this arms dealer,” the officer said.
Inquiries have also revealed that the entire plan began with arrested accused Ishrat Sheikh (41) approaching Mohammed Anees Merchant (35), who was held in July.
Sheikh reportedly told his interrogators that due to severe poverty, besides the responsibility to raise four daughters, he approached Merchant, seeking employment. Sheikh has allegedly been involved with underworld activities since 1995. He had been arrested by the Lucknow Special Task Force along with Merchant in 2007 for allegedly transporting weapons, which were to be used to attack actor and singer Himesh Reshammiya at the behest of gangster Ejaz Lakdawala, the police said.
“Sheikh and Merchant put together a team of young unemployed men as all of the fugitive’s old associates are at present lodged in jail.
Sheikh was present when shots were fired outside Morani’s residence and had come to the producer-director’s Khar office to personally carry out the hit job after the others failed to complete it even after two months,” the officer said.

Ahead of 26/11 attacks anniversary  RPF beefs up security at railwaystationsPrint
By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:05 am
Ahead of the sixth anniversary of terror attacks in Mumbai on November 26, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) of the Western Railway (WR) has deployed anti-terrorism teams at suburban railway stations. Though no specific inputs of terror activities were cited, senior officials said the measure was a part of regular security deployment at stations.
“We have deployed RPF personnel in groups to specifically check for any terror-related activity ahead of 26/11,” said an RPF officer, who did not wish to be named.
When asked if the teams were formed following specific threats at suburban railway stations, the officer said it was a routine exercise. On Central Railway (CR), the RPF maintained that the anti-terrorists teams were already in place and continued to conduct regular checks at stations.
“Our dog squad was recently strengthened and the security apparatus, the Integrated Security System (ISS), has also been set up at major railway stations. We have a continuous surveillance at railway stations under the ISS,” said Alok Bohra, senior divisional security commissioner, RPF, CR (Mumbai division).
A group of 10 terrorists carried out a series of shootings and bombings across several locations in south Mumbai on the night of November 26, 2008, killing 166 people and injuring 309. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) was one of the sites that was targeted.
Following the attacks, there was felt an urgent need to beef up security at railway stations and an ISS was proposed to improve the security of passengers and thwart terror attacks.
The ISS, which is under implementation on the Central Railway, comprises a dog squad, under vehicle search system (UVSS), closed circuit television cameras (CCTVs), door metal frame detectors (DFMDs) and hand held metal detectors. Though CCTVs and DFMDs have been procured and installed by the WR as well, the ISS, as a complete security programme, is yet to be implemented by the Zonal Railways.

Obama orders review of hostage policy  following Bergdahl swap  Islamic State beheadingsBy Katie Zezima November 18 Follow @katiezez

The White House said Tuesday that it has ordered a review of how it responds when an American is taken hostage overseas.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that President Obama ordered the review over the summer. "Given sort of the extraordinary nature of some of the hostage takings that we'd seen this year, the president felt it was warranted to direct the relevant departments and agencies who have traditionally been involved in assisting families as they try to recover the safe return of their family members," Earnest said. 
Three American hostages, James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Abdul-Rahman Kassig, have been beheaded by the Islamic State militants in Syria this year. A video announcing the execution of Kassig, who was formerly known as Peter, was released Sunday; Obama called his death "an act of pure evil."
Foley's mother said in a CNN interview that she doesn't believe the U.S. did enough to save her son. "I think our efforts to get Jim freed were an annoyance," Diane Foley said.
In May, Obama celebrated the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was traded  for five Taliban commanders. But the president was harshly criticized for the deal, by Republican lawmakers and some members of the military. As the Washington Post r eported in June, "GOP lawmakers say the administration failed to give them advance warning of the deal as required by law, and question whether the exchange was worth it given the danger the Taliban combatants could pose to U.S. troops once they are returned to Afghanistan next year."
In a letter to Obama sent Tuesday, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) recommended that the administration appoint one person to lead efforts to bring back Americans in captivity overseas. "It is my firm belief that we are not exhausting the full range of options," Hunter wrote.
Earnest said that changing the policy on not paying ransoms to secure the release of hostage will not be considered.
"Our views on this are clear, and the president continues to believe, as previous presidents have concluded, that it’s not the best interests of American citizens to pay ransom to any organization, let alone a terrorist organization, that’s holding an American hostage," Earnest said.
Hunter's office has said that a review of whether or not the U.S. should engage monetarily should be conducted. Hunter wrote in a letter to the Department of Defense earlier this month that a payment was made to an intermediary in Afghanistan who, along with the money, disappeared. The Department of Defense has continually said that it did not pay any money to secure Bergdahl's release.
 

The GOPs Jonathan Gruber offensive and its narrow path to successBy Philip Bump November 18 Follow @pbump
Economist Jonathan Gruber speaks at a conference of the Workers Compensation Research Institute in Boston on March 12, 2014. (Dominick Reuter/Reuters)
The week-long tumult over the comments of Obamacare consultant/architect/outsider/author/guru/casual observer Jonathan Gruber has brought one partisan distinction into very sharp focus. Democrats are all in on the success of the Affordable Care Act itself. Republicans have placed nearly all of their money on the idea that the ACA is doomed by original sin.
You've seen the Gruber comments, by now — or some iteration of them, anyway. An economist at MIT who parlayed savvy with government number-crunching into lucrative consulting gigs, Gruber appears to have dealt that latter career a death blow by repeatedly suggesting (or directly saying) that Americans were too stupid to understand the law's intricacies and that the bill was drafted to exploit this convenient fact. This has become a key ingredient in a buffet of conservative anger , with more clips emerging and Democrats insisting that Gruber's role wasn't as important as has been suggested.
There are three tiers to this story by now.
Tier 1 is the question of how involved Gruber was in the genesis of the Affordable Care Act. That has largely been answered , thanks to The Post's Karen Tumulty, but still provides fodder for pieces like this from the conservative Free Beacon .
Tier 2 is the extent to which Gruber's comments reflect dishonest dealing on the part of the administration. When Gruber says that "lack of transparency is a huge political advantage" and that "the stupidity of the American voter" was "critical to get anything to pass," it's taken as a reflection of how the administration looked at the development of the ACA — largely because the comments reflect existing conservative frustrations about the law's genesis.
(That link, from Reihan Salam at Slate, is one of the best conservative articulations of Obamacare concerns that I've seen. Probably the best liberal perspective on the debate is Jonathan Cohn's at the New Republic .)
Tier 3 is the question of how well the law itself is working. With open enrollment just underway over the weekend, Gruber's comments have become intertwined with analysis of how the law looks, a year on.
And this is where the dichotomy is laid bare. Democrats have always assumed that Obamacare would prove to be a boon over the long term, that the contentious fight over passage of the bill and massive disruptions like the faulty Web site would, over time, get lost in the background of a policy that made health care affordable and accessible to millions of people. As I've noted before, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) figured Obamacare would help Dems this year  — even while HealthCare.gov was still fluky.
That millions have gotten coverage already makes the Republican effort more difficult. The right had focused on a two-prong fight. The first prong was the hope that the Democrats would be wrong, and that Obamacare wouldn't work well. This pre-dated the roll-out of the program (remember Sen. Ted Cruz's day-long speech?), and was bolstered with the Web site glitches and with the influx of complaints about cancelled coverage, the most tangible negative effect for many Americans (though not as many as some conservatives might have you believe).
Those cancellations, of course, were more effective to the conservative Tier 2 argument: That Obama and his surrogates had lied when they said that "if you like your plan, you can keep it." This fit nicely with Gruber and also with complaints about a lack of transparency at the law's passage and with arguments that the law is doomed thanks to poorly written subsidy language — all reinforcing the idea that Obamacare should be uprooted, restarted, undone.
Republicans had largely been quiet about Obamacare over the course of the campaign, perhaps partly out of concern  that it would rile up the Democratic base. But it was probably also, in part, because Obamacare was humming along without any glitches. Approval of the policy on the whole slipped downward recently, thanks largely to independents. But users generally rate the coverage and experience well , at levels comparable to non-exchange programs.
The emergence of Gruber has allowed conservatives to once again argue against Obamacare almost solely for Tier 2 reasons: That it exposes the flawed way in which Obamacare was crafted. (There are, perhaps obviously, plenty of counter-arguments to that idea.) The importance of the first-tier, the attempt to bind Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as tightly to Gruber as possible, was almost solely to reinforce that second-tier idea that they, the indisputable owners of the policy, were entirely complicit with Gruber's line of thinking.
(Not to mention that those Tier 1 revelations just look bad. Gruber's stupid "stupid" comments are political poison; what can be worse than appearing to say that voters are idiots? Democrats would have run from Gruber even if he'd been the architect of National Pet-A-Puppy Day, much less a contentious bit of policy.)
So this is how the chips are being played. Republicans are insisting that Gruber demonstrates that Obamacare was irreparably politically flawed from the outset. Democrats are hoping that Obamacare will continue to prove itself to be politically and practically viable. And it's extremely unlikely that anything will dislodge these positions until one of three things happens: (1)  the Supreme Court weighs in , (2) something goes spectacularly wrong with Obamacare, or (3) we hit Jan. 20, 2017.
The first case is probably good news for Republicans. The second case definitely would be. The third case depends very much on who is being sworn in as president. And, given the politics at play, it's probably the only case in which Tier 2 — and Gruber — makes much of a difference.

ISIS Power unplugs from nameISIS Power unplugs from name

Elk Grove electronics company ISIS Power forced to change its name
What do you do when your business is named ISIS?
ISIS name proves bad for business for Elk Grove company
ISIS Power, an Elk Grove Village manufacturer of automotive electrical wiring systems, isn't a terrorist organization. That's what president and founder Jay Harris has been telling customers and the curious alike for months.
But sharing a name with a militant Islamic group has proved bad for business recently, and the 5-year-old company rebranded itself last week as Infinitybox.
Late last year, a Belgian chocolate maker changed its name from Italo Suisse, because the company no longer had any real association with either country. Now it's changing the name again - because the new name it picked was ISIS. ( Reuters )
"When things started to go south in the Middle East, for a while we really held our ground," Harris said. "But unfortunately, it just got to a point where the connotation with our brand and some pretty awful people just became so negative."
ISIS Power began as a division of Chicago-based Littelfuse, where Harris worked for 17 years, becoming global director of business development for the automotive division. Harris assembled investors and bought the brand, launching his own company in 2009.
8
The company has eight employees and does several million dollars in annual revenue, designing and manufacturing electronic control systems for race cars, police and fire command vehicles, buses, military trucks and other vehicles. Basically, anything that can be switched on or off — from sirens to lights to fuel pumps — runs through an ISIS box, according to Harris.
Its original name was an acronym for the product: Intelligent Silicon Integrated System.
"It was a fairly benign brand then, and it started to gain some good traction, some good recognition," said Harris, 41, an Oak Park resident.
But when the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS, gained notoriety this year through military advances and gruesome beheading videos, the Elk Grove company began to suffer by association.
"Where it impacted us wasn't in our existing customers — they knew who we were, they knew what we did — but it was really impacting our ability for new people to find us," Harris said. "Because when you searched for ISIS Power, you didn't get to our website, you got to things that were certainly unrelated to us."
Web analytics in recent months revealed that many visitors to the ISIS Power site were looking for the other ISIS, with keywords such as beheading videos topping the list of search terms, according to Harris.
The tipping point for Harris came in September, when a longtime customer asked out of monthly emails from the company, for reasons other than inbox clutter.
0
"His response to me was take me off your list, you are a radical Muslim terrorist," Harris said. "I want nothing to do with your business, I don't want the CIA monitoring my emails."
ISIS Power is not the only brand to relinquish its name in the wake of the negative association with the militant organization. Last month, Belgian chocolate-maker ISIS changed its name to Libeert after some customers refused to stock the old brand.
"The problem is that ISIS has really taken control of that brand," said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. "So any company that is using anything similar to that has a problem. People are very quickly going to connect the terrorist organization to that name."
Harris said he has spent about $400,000 over the years building up the ISIS Power brand through sponsored cable TV shows, prints ads and other vehicles. He spent another $30,000 over the past few months scrubbing every trace of the name from his business and website to rebrand as Infinitybox, a name he unveiled last week at SEMA, an automotive specialty trade show held annually in Las Vegas.
The rebranding process was a "a significant distraction and expense," but early reaction to the new name has been positive, according to Harris.
"It's been very, very favorable," Harris said. "Our customer base has rallied behind us. They are saying it's unfortunate what happened to your business, but they think the name change is a good move."
While ISIS Power stood its ground and defended its name for as long as it could, it was a war it could not win, according to Calkins.
"It was reasonable to wait, but it's become fairly clear that ISIS is not going away anytime soon," Calkins said. "I don't think you can send the ISIS terrorist group a letter asking them to cease and desist the use of the name."

A vital brain structure was forgotten for 100 years because scientists couldnt agreeBy Rachel Feltman November 18 Follow @rachelfeltman

A group of researchers has tracked the complicated history of a long-forgotten neural pathway, revealing that the brain structure — which is vital to our ability to read — was lost to neurologists for a century because of bickering and confusion.
When University of Washington researcher Jason Yeatman was earning his PhD at Stanford a few years back, he spotted a bundle of nerve fibers in the brain that he'd never heard about before. Yeatman, who was studying the brain structures that contribute to language processing and reading, saw that the unfamiliar connective structure was an important one.

Because he and his colleagues couldn't find any mention of this structure in medical literature, they thought it might be a new discovery. But when they reached out to others in the field, they heard back from one scientist who vaguely remembered this bundle of nerves — from an old medical textbook.
A really old medical textbook. To track down the piece of brain's initial discovery, Yeatman and his colleagues had to dig into texts from the turn of the 20th century.
It was revealed as the vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF), discovered by a German neurologist named Carl Wenicke and included in his 1881 brain atlas. Yeatman could have stopped there, having found the right man to credit in his research papers. But he was intrigued by the structure's 10o-year-long disappearance from academic literature. "That started us on this fascinating detective mission figuring out how this brain anatomy got forgotten," he said.
It took a year of digging through Stanford's archives, but he solved the mystery. When Wernicke discovered the VOF, he may have ticked off his mentor, the neuroanatomist Theodor Meynert.
Meynert had theorized that all neural pathways moved from front to back across the brain — horizontally. But the VOF travels vertically, so its existence messed with Meynert's beliefs, which were generally accepted among scientists of the time.
Meynert didn't include the VOF in this 1892 diagram. (Yeatman et al, PNAS)
For whatever reason, Meynert never discussed the VOF the way he did other structures discovered by Wernicke. It's possible that the structure just didn't interest him, however, as opposed to him snubbing his student intentionally.
Without a signal boost from Meynert, the structure remained obscure. Others observed it, but they didn't call it by the same name, or described it differently because of their dissection techniques.
"Imagine being a student at the time, and trying to decipher this," Yeatman said. "Some people are saying the structure doesn't exist or are arguing about it, and some are giving it different names." He thinks that the confusion kept anyone from recognizing the VOF in modern textbooks.
Though obscure, the VOF may turn out to be very important.
"It connects the regions of the brain that are important for perceiving forms — like recognizing a friend's face or reading a word — with the regions that help you move your eyes and focus on a particular place in space," Yeatman said. So it could help the brain connect those two different kinds of perception, allowing readers to scan entire pages of text rapidly and recognize individual words.

After 2-year-old is shaken to death  a dispute over her organsA brain-dead 2-year-old girl from Brooklyn will remain on life support until her parents resolve their bitter dispute over what to do with her organs.
(New York Daily News)
On Wednesday, Thaiya Spruill-Smith was shaken so violently by her stepfather, 25-year-old David Adams, during a crying fit that the toddler slipped into a coma the following morning, Gothamist reported .
Doctors declared her brain dead on Friday, the same day that Adams was charged with assault after he admitted to investigators “that he had shaken the girl and thrown her onto a bed,” according to the New York Times .
Lupé Todd, a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn district attorney, told the paper that Adams will most probably face murder charges “if the medical examiner’s office rules the death a homicide.”
The New York Daily News reported that Adams also faces two counts of assault, one count of reckless assault and charges related to endangering the welfare of a child for incidents that occurred between Oct. 10 and 20. “Prosecutors declined to provide the details behind the earlier assault charges,” the paper reported, “but the complaint described similar shakings of the child.”
On Monday, a judge ordered Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center to keep Spruill-Smith on life support “for at least another day,” according to Fox News .
The child’s mother, 24-year-old Teoka Spruill, wants to donate her daughter’s organs to another child; but her father, 26-year-old Terrell Smith, wants his daughter to be buried with her body intact, Fox reported.
“She was born with that, she’s going to be buried with that, her body, her eyes — it’s what makes her her,” Smith told the Times. “My daughter was born with that, and she’s going to lie down with the same thing.”
Spruill argued that the organs could save another child’s life, which would allow her daughter to live on.
“I would love for Thai’s organs to be donated, but her father doesn’t want that,” Spruill told the Daily News . “I’d love to bless somebody else’s child with life. Thaiya was my life.”
Adding to the acrimony, according to the Daily News, is the Smith family’s assertion that the child’s mother is responsible for the young girl’s death and has been absent from the hospital.
“Her not being here shows how true it is,” Smith’s sister, La’Sean Brooks, told the paper. “Why are you not here then? Because you’re guilty.”

These 5 countries accounted for nearly all the worlds terrorism deaths last yearBy Adam Taylor November 18 Follow @mradamtaylor
(Institute for Economics and Peace)
All around the world, terrorism is a huge threat. And what's especially worrying is that for all the advances made in recent years, the threat of terror seems to be worsening. A new report from the Institute for Economics and Peace  (IEP) finds that there was a 61 percent increase in deaths from terrorism globally in 2013. The group also notes that the data it collected shows a five-fold increase in the number of deaths caused by terrorism since 2000.
However, although the Global Terrorism Index notes that there were 17,958 deaths from terrorism in 60 countries last year, the numbers show that more than 80 percent of those deaths occurred in just five countries and accounted for the global figures going up.
The five countries are:
Iraq — where 2,492 incidents in 2013 left 6,362 dead.
Afghanistan — where 1,148 incidents left 3,111 dead.
Pakistan — where 1,933 incidents left 2,345 dead.
Nigeria — where 303 incidents left 1,826 dead.
Syria — where 217 incidents left 1,078 dead.
In each of these countries, there has been a dramatic increase in violence in recent years: In Iraq, for instance, the IEP finds a 162 percent increase in violence from 2012 to 2013. And before we continue, let's consider that these are figures for 2013 and do not include the dramatic increases in violence in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan this year. Next year's report is not likely to offer better news, either.
The next country on the list is India, where 624 incidents left 404 people dead, the IEP finds. The wealthy countries that make up the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suffered a slim minority of terrorism fatalities. Turkey had 34 attacks and 57 deaths in 2013, the highest of any OECD country, while the United States had nine attacks and six deaths. The United Kingdom had a high number of attacks (131), but most of these were small-scale attacks in Northern Ireland and left only three dead. Israel had 28 attacks in 2013 that left two people dead (the Palestinian territories are not included in the index).
The IEP's findings are likely to be somewhat controversial. For one thing, there's no universally accepted definition of terrorism, and it has become a highly politicized term in recent years. The IEP uses the definition agreed upon by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland:
"the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."
The report explains that it is not including deaths in Syria caused by conventional warfare, for example. However, in a complicated civil war such as Syria's, the line between conventional and nonconventional warfare often gets blurred. As the report itself notes, "Terrorism has been deployed as a tactic by some of the rebel forces to bring about a political, economic, religious, or social goal rather than purely military objectives."
Perhaps even more controversially, the IEP finds that only four terrorist organizations — the Islamic State, Boko Haram, the Taliban and al-Qaeda — had asserted responsibility for more than 66 percent of the deaths. The United States has been involved in the military battle against all of these groups.
And although it may seem morally right to fight them, other evidence suggests that it may not help that much in the long run. The report finds that 80 percent of all the terrorist organizations that have ceased to operate since the 1960s did so probably because of policing or politicization efforts. Just 10 percent of the groups could be said to have achieved their aims — and just 7 percent were eliminated by military engagement.

Army chooses 31 women for potential Ranger School experimentBy Dan Lamothe November 18 Follow @danlamothe

Army officials have selected 31 women as advisers and observers at its elite, all-male Ranger School, the latest indication that some women might be allowed to take the course next year.
The decision is deeply controversial among some rank-and-file troops, and follows a 2013 decision by the Pentagon to fully integrate women into the military. Service officials have until 2016 to do so or seek exemptions for certain jobs. It’s remains uncertain what service officials will do in the conventional infantry and elite units like the 75th Ranger Regiment, both of which can be grueling physically.
The women selected for the potential Ranger School experiment includes 11 officers and 20 enlisted noncommissioned officers, officials with the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade at Fort Benning, Ga., said in a Facebook post. They took part in a week of training there to get a better sense of the mental and physical demands placed on Ranger students. More than three dozen women had applied for the positions.
Post by US Army Fort Benning .
“I was very satisfied with both the quality and quantity of the volunteers we received,” said Maj. Gen. Scott Miller, commanding general of the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning. “Their performance and professionalism over the course of the week was extraordinary. This group did very well for what was a very physically challenging week for any Soldier.”
Col. David Fivecoat, commander of the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade, said the women were interviewed by Army officials and attempted numerous events incorporated in Ranger training before their selection, he said.
The Ranger Course is 62 days long, and includes three phases. The first is at Fort Benning. The second takes place in the mountains of Camp Frank D. Merrill in Dahlonega, Ga., and the third occurs in swamps at Camp James E. Rudder at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla. If women take the course and pass next year, they will be allowed to wear the Army’s prestigious Ranger tab on their uniform, but will not joint the 75th Ranger Regiment.
To pass Ranger School, students must receive a passing grade while leading a patrol, a positive peer review and have no more than three negative “spot reports,” Army officials said. The students also must complete a variety of physically demanding tasks, including a physical assessment test, a 12-mile road march, a land navigation course, and a combat water survival assessment.
The military continues to consider how to integrate women in the other services, as well. In the Marine Corps, for example, the 13-week Infantry Officer Course was opened in 2012, and enlisted infantry training was opened in 2013. Some women have passed the enlisted program, but are not allowed to serve in the infantry. No women have passed the officer course, which is considered more difficult.

How much a mother weighs before shes pregnant will impact her childs life expectancyBy Elahe Izadi November 18 Follow @ElaheIzadi
The health of mothers-to-be can have a long-term and very specific impact on the children they bear.
Researchers have found that adults whose mothers were overweight or obese before they became pregnant had a 90 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease or death from such heart-related problems. The findings were presented Tuesday before the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions meeting.
Researchers looked to the Framingham Heart Study cohort of 879 people who were tracked between 1971 and 2012. Information about their mothers' pre-pregnancy weight was also available. During that four-decade time frame, 138 people died, 28 of whom suffered cardiovascular deaths. And a total of 193 cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart failure, took place.
Within the group that researchers analyzed, 10 percent of the mothers were overweight before getting pregnant, meaning they had a body mass index of 25 or higher. (The measurements were taken, on average, two years prior to them becoming pregnant.) The children of those overweight or obese mothers had a much higher risk of cardiovascular disease or death, than the children of mothers who were of normal weight, the researchers said.
Previous research has shown a connection between maternal obesity and childhood obesity and early adult cardiovascular risk factors, such as elevated cholesterol, said Michael Mendelson, the study's lead author and a research fellow with Boston University and Boston Children's Hospital. So he and his team wanted to find out if those risk factors translated into problems later in life, and even death.
Mendelson said the findings add to the body of evidence that reducing excess weight in young people carries numerous positive outcomes.
"What we're showing here, there may be a potential benefit in the next generation, decades later," he said. "To think that you can see that connection over so long, it's unbelievable."
And while genetics is likely playing a role here, "the genetic sequences aren't explaining as much as we initially thought," Mendelson said. Rather, a shared lifestyle and environment "that make mothers obese may get passed on to children."

Hasbro helps kids with disabilities learn to play...and
versions
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Toymakers at Hasbro don't want Mr. Potato Head to end up at the bottom of toy boxes, simply because children with developmental disabilities don't know how to play with him.
Hasbro Inc. has partnered with The Autism Project, a group of parents and professionals that help people with autism to create instructional videos and tools to help children with developmental disabilities learn how to play with their toys.
The Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based toy company will launch the "ToyBox Tools" initiative on Wednesday in Columbus, Ohio at a national conference on autism and disabilities, OCALICON 2014.
Parents and caregivers can access the tools for eight of Hasbro's classic toys for free online at the ToyBox Tools website. The series of Mr. Potato Head videos introduce children to the toy, explain how to assemble him in creative ways and show how to play with him with other children.
Karen Davis, the senior vice president of global philanthropy and social impact at Hasbro, said that knowing how to play with these toys may not be intuitive for children with developmental disabilities, including autism. Three engineers at the company thought of the idea, she said, so every child can "experience the joy of play."
About 15 percent of children in the United States have a developmental disability, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"To be able to help this group of kids means an awful lot to us," Davis said Tuesday. "We're really looking forward to seeing where this goes."
Joanne Quinn, executive director of The Autism Project, said ToyBox Tools will have a "huge impact" because parents will feel more empowered to play with their children, and children will learn how to play at their own pace and learn important life skills.
Parents and teachers sometimes write out instructional materials for toys or show videos of other kids playing, but no one has collected everything in one place for everyone to use, she added.
"Hasbro has given us such a platform to help so many families, it's fantastic," Quinn said.
Davis said Hasbro hopes to get suggestions from the experts at the conference to improve the online resources. Hasbro may develop similar videos and printed instructions for more toys in the future, she added.

3 Ways Customer Listening Powers Marketing Effectivenessreddit
Today customers can make sure that their voice is heard like never before. And, if marketers don't have measures in place to listen, they are turning a deaf ear to potentially significant problems and missing out on essential insights for improving their customer experience.
Following are 3 ways to leverage customer listening and examples of how companies are putting these strategies into action.
1. Realize that Customer Listening (and Responding) is a 360-Degree Commitment.
Engagement with customers includes business partners who are also the face of your brand. So, how every aspect of your brand listens to the voice of your customer and responds is key.
For example, NASCAR made the decision to revamp its marketing and listening in five key areas . But that's not where it ended. NASCAR also encouraged its business partners and drivers to do the same.
"We developed an industry action plan," stated Steve Phelps NASCAR CMO, "... A plan for digital and social, a plan for driver star power-and within each plan, [we came up with] a number of different action items ... [In an] effort to be thought leaders who provide the best available experience to our fans. We strongly encourage those across the entire landscape of the sport to embrace digital and social media -- from drivers and teams to tracks and corporate partners."
With new technologies NASCAR is boasting 6,000 tweets a minute, 565,000 posts per day and one million posts per event.
2. Customers are More Than Numbers, They are People, Talk to Them ... (And listen.)
Data gives you a good view of what customers are doing. However, it is not going to tell you why or give you the emotional factors like a conversation . Personal interactions can be more valuable than all the big data you will ever collect.
Starting in October, Flow and Columbus Business Solutions , a telecommunications company serving the Caribbean, asked customers to tell them how they felt. Michele English, Columbus' executive vice president and chief customer officer noted, "Our plan is to significantly enhance our customer 'listening' systems and ensure that feedback is integrated into our daily decisions and connected to our customers' experiences across the organization... we have to design and implement [operational processes] to ensure that every customer touch point in the organization can support our customers' needs efficiently and effectively... We now look forward to more customer feedback. "
The Company designed an easy to use online customer survey and sent communications to customers to encourage them to complete the survey and tell the company what matters.
3. Make Conversation (and Listening) Easy with Social Communities
Online communities enable the exchange of ideas in discussion forums, polls and social media. They provide brand information, mitigate problems and provide opportunities for a collaborative two-way conversation.
Southwest Airlines launched a Listening Center to monitor its online communities using a keyword-based listening tool that pulls in mentions from social platforms. The Listening Center monitors insights in real time to quickly identify issues and immediate engagement opportunities. Customers can connect their Twitter handles to their Rapid Rewards frequent flier numbers to get personalized services. Southwest Airlines also leverages the Listening Centers to send apology letters for delays, find new opportunities for engagement and implement company-wide customer care.
Alice Wilson, social business advisor for Southwest's marketing organization notes that sharing the information collected is the key to listening success. "The customer feedback means something different to each [department] and can inform each group in a different way...From a social care standpoint, [employees] want to help assist and resolve. But somebody from the marketing team may be looking at that [data and ask], how do we alter communications to help these future situations?...The point is not to keep it as a silo."
Keys to Effectively Listening to the Voice of Your Customer:
Listening should be at the heart of your marketing strategy. Listening lets you understand the "why" of what your customers are doing and experiencing so that operational issues, communication, and experience can be overhauled for a more positive overall brand impression.
Learnings from Listening Need to be Shared with Every Part of your Business. Having data without acting on the implications does nothing for your business. Set standards for how the insights from your listening programs are regularly integrated and shared with all departments so that changes and actions are put in motion to respond to customer needs and comments.
Meaningful Dialogue Based on Listening. Develop authentic, honest and direct conversations based on listening, which lead to meaningful connections and two-way dialogue.
Use Listening to Develop Strategies. Once you launch programs to listen, develop means for incorporating these learnings into new strategies that address the issues identified in customer conversations. Put in motion ongoing review of the data collected through listening programs so that you have a clear roadmap that delineates what customers are expecting, their pain points and their current/future demands.
Listening Objectives Must be Established. If you don't know how you are going to listen, you will not be able to hear what your customers are trying to tell you. Whether you have the means to set up a full scale listening center, a social monitoring program, a survey, or a call center monitoring program, know what you are implementing and how you will regularly harvest and utilize the insights.
In summary, customers have a lot to say and they want you to listen. The good news is that customers generally have valid concerns and smart advice to offer. Marketers and customers will both benefit if the marketer creates multichannel ways of listening to customers and processes for acting quickly on their input.

Euro gains on sentiment data  yen weakens0
Sterling and the New Zealand and Australian dollars had been the main losers among major currencies early in Europe, both the Aussie and the kiwi hurt by trade numbers from China showing a sharp drop in imports and another 2 percent slide in oil prices.
Sterling and the Aussie recovered most of those losses, but the kiwi traded almost 0.9 percent lower by 0630 ET while Norway's crown - exceptionally sensitive to oil prices - dropped around half a percent against both the euro and dollar.
"With the kiwi, its more the move higher in U.S. yields than anything," said Hardman. "It's really a big story of dollar strength."
The Swiss franc, another very low yielding currency, fell to an 18-month low of 0.9818 francs per dollar.
TARGETTED
Among big events for markets this week are the European Central Bank's second offer of targeted loans (TLTRO) to banks and speeches by a handful of U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of next week's final policy meeting of the year.
"The jobs numbers supported the dollar and we expect this trend to continue ahead of the Fed meeting as interest rate expectations continue to adjust," said Josh O'Byrne, a strategist with Citi in London.
Overall, the dollar was up another 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies. Dealers said the yen was supported by around $2 billion worth of options expiries at 121.50 yen per dollar, putting a cap on the dollar's strength.
Most major banks continue to predict further gains for the dollar against its major peers in 2015, although the surge past 120 yen has left some wondering how much juice there still is in the yen trade, at least for now.
There is also Japan's national election next Sunday, currently seen as likely to give a boost to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and reflationary policies which weaken the yen.
The euro fell to a low of $1.2247 after Nowotny's comments.
"We expect the euro to continue to weaken in the week ahead," analysts from French bank BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. "Another low TLTRO uptake could put some upside pressure on euro front-end rates. However, low demand would also increase the chances of an increase in asset purchases (by the ECB) early next year."

Entrepreneurs: Engines of Our Economic Growthreddit
The bedrock of America's economy is the ability of entrepreneurs and innovators to start new ventures and build them through hard work and perseverance. That's why we, and many of our colleagues in the pro-growth New Democrat Coalition, introduced a resolution celebrating America's entrepreneurs with "National Entrepreneurs' Day" on the third Tuesday of each November.
We did it to honor the contributions of people like Shana Gonzales of Atlanta, a hardworking entrepreneur profiled in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal earlier this year. Ms. Gonzales rose from a part-time cashier's job at a Taco Bell in the 1990s to ownership of four restaurants that generate $3.5 million in annual revenue.
If you listen to Ms. Gonzales speak, you'll hear echoes of a more optimistic, can-do era in American history. Speaking about her constant efforts to grow her business, she says, "Every time I think about getting out of the business, something exciting happens -- a promotion or a new direction that keeps me engaged."
A promotion. A new direction. Millions of Americans have been longing to hear those words for years. They may have been bruised by the impact of the Great Recession, but they're still fighting for a shot to strike out on their own and build their own success in America.
There's no question that the flame of entrepreneurship still burns brightly for millions of Americans: According to the Kauffman Foundation, 70 percent of our young people still dream of owning their own business one day. And new business owners are still putting their own resources on the line to kickstart their ventures: Eighty-two percent of entrepreneurs in 2012 used their own savings for startup cash. That level of commitment and determination makes it clear that entrepreneurs and small-business owners will continue to power our economic growth.
But on National Entrepreneurs' Day, we also have a responsibility to ensure that our policies help give every would-be business owner a fair shot in this economy. That means supporting two key bipartisan priorities: comprehensive tax reform and common-sense regulatory reform.
Our tax code, last updated at a time when America was a preeminent, unchallenged power atop the global economy, needs to be made simpler, fairer and more competitive. The office of the Taxpayer Advocate estimates that individuals and businesses spent an average of 6.1 billion hours a year on tax preparation or compliance, the same as hiring 3 million full-time employees. And compliance costs hit small businesses the hardest: It's more important than ever to give our businesses a tax code that provides stability and predictability. If we don't, our businesses will continue to flee offshore in search of tax havens, and our entrepreneurs will be forced to look elsewhere as they launch the next great products.
Likewise, our regulatory code must be streamlined for the 21st-century economy.  While we have a responsibility to protect consumers and ensure that American workplaces are safe, we can do that without harming economic growth. The Federal Code of Regulations numbers nearly 170,000 pages, and more pages are added to the code almost every single day. An analysis by the Progressive Policy Institute shows that the number of pages in the code more than doubled since 1975. We have a choice: We can either grow the mounds of paper that our entrepreneurs have to sift through to launch new ventures, or we can make the code simpler and easier to navigate, allowing our economy to grow and create new jobs.
With smarter, more responsible tax policies and a leaner, more effective regulatory regime, we can ensure that our entrepreneurs have the tools they need to open the doors and hire and renew Americans' faith in the strength of our economic engine.
That would be the best National Entrepreneurs' Day gift of all.
Reps. Scott Peters of California and Patrick Murphy of Florida, both members of the pro-growth House New Democrat Coalition, introduced a resolution to create a "National Entrepreneurs' Day" in 2013. Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin, Chairman of the New Democrat Coalition, is a co-sponsor.

SAS Culture  Technology Saves Lives - Including My Daughter sreddit
Imagine going in for a routine ultrasound at five months. The thrill of learning whether your first child will be a boy or girl turning to panic as you learn that your baby girl, at eight weeks in utero, has suffered a stroke. Joy turning to shock as doctors ask you about ending your pregnancy.
I don't have to imagine. It happened to me. While my SAS work family provided emotional support, SAS software would play another role I never anticipated.
Despite everything, one thing that was amazing to me was that I could grieve knowing I had this amazing support network around me -- a virtual net of colleague friends. I knew if I fell, it would be fine; I would be caught and lifted back up.
My husband and I opted to continue the pregnancy. We researched the condition, monitored the baby's development and devised a plan for when she was born. In the hospital, moments after Reagan's birth, I was presented with test results that helped give us some much-needed direction.
And amidst these results -- smack in the middle of the lab report? SAS Analytics . Software from my very own employer had provided valuable insight that helped my family make significant decisions about Reagan's life before and after she was born. Those choices also meant physical therapy began the day she was born.
And, it wasn't just answers about Reagan's life that these tests provided. It was hope for the future of our family. SAS analytics conducted on Reagan's blood work told us that Reagan's condition was not genetic; rather, a very rare, one-off occurrence. With that information, we were no longer afraid of having more children -- the large family we always wanted.
After Reagan was born, getting her to therapy every day while working was incredibly hard for me. Yet, no one at SAS made me feel like I had to choose between working or getting my child therapy. My managers just made it work. And, during those times, I worked harder for SAS than I ever did before, because I felt so grateful.
As a remote employee based in Texas, I don't have immediate access to the free healthcare center or the fitness classes that employees at SAS World Headquarters enjoy. And I had to find my own pharmacy to fill some important prescriptions instead of using the onsite pharmacy in Cary. But I still experience the best of SAS' widely recognized culture. The healthcare benefits, of course. But more importantly, the work/life balance. The managerial support. The camaraderie.  The family. The flexibility to focus on my family without jeopardizing my career.
How do you repay this? There's no good way. But, in an auditorium at SAS world headquarters in Cary, NC, I personally thanked the many SAS employees who worked with, and supported, my family in some capacity to help us maintain the balance that we needed to thrive; and, I thanked the developers behind the life-saving technology that changed Reagan's life -- and ours.
It is amazing to think that I work for a company that helped diagnose Reagan, that provided us opportunities, flexibility and resources to get her the therapies she needed to let her take her first steps. It was truly amazing for us. There's no way to thank the people who write the software that has given her the life she wouldn't have otherwise had, and enable her to do things they said she'd never do.
As a constant on Best Workplaces lists worldwide, SAS is well-known for its workplace culture. Critics often claim that companies like SAS create these utopian workplace environments just to keep employees at their desks longer. It's a ploy to keep them close and encourage them to work more.
My story exemplifies how that's just not the case at SAS. The culture at SAS truly is about keeping employees happy in all aspects of their lives. Sure, the employees love the benefits, but they also love what they do. SAS employees know the work that they do makes a difference in people's lives. Customers can feel that passion in the experiences they have with SAS.
And, occasionally, that difference in someone's life is the life of a colleague who publicly says, "Thank you" to the friends who helped change her child's life.

Canada s Young G20 Leaders Call for Real Jobs Solutionsreddit
The recent remarks by Bank of Canada's Governor Stephen Poloz, that young people struggling to find work should consider "working for free," were highly controversial. Particularly so for nearly 50 percent of the world's population under the age of 30, many of whom are struggling to find honest, paid work, just to survive.
Ultimately, Poloz's statements are not part of the solution, and that is a problem.
On November 15 and 16, the G20 world leaders convened in Brisbane, Australia to discuss global economic issues. One major agenda item this year was the youth unemployment challenge. It is high time for real action.
Currently, the rate of youth unemployment is 14.5 percent in Canada. That is, more than 411,000 young people under 25 were unemployed this past spring. In contrast, among Canadians aged 25 to 54, the unemployment rate stood at 5.8 percent.
The pronounced difference between the two percentages is quite alarming. Moreover, young people are also more affected by economic recessions because firms initially respond to financial distress by stopping recruitment rather than dismissing experienced staff.
Youth are almost more likely to take on contract work and take part in unpaid work experiences. It is essential to not only improve employment but to also promote decent employment since unpaid work leads to inequality.
Young people also face a higher risk of unemployment when compared to older workers, even under optimal economic conditions. This is the case since there is often a delay between the end of their academic career and their first job. The numbers of youth unemployment are on the rise globally, and Canadian youth are no exception.
This past July, the Young Diplomats of Canada sent a delegation of Canadian youth to attend the G20's youth engagement group conference, the 2014 Y20 Summit , in Sydney, Australia. At the Y20, these bright, young Canadian leaders engaged with other G20 youth representatives to discuss and prioritize additional strategies to reduce youth unemployment.
Online negotiations preceding the Y20 allowed delegates to align on priority focal points including:
supporting youth entrepreneurship,
protecting youth jobs, and;
promoting decent employment.
At the conference, these priorities were further discussed and fleshed out. The delegate's official declaration and the Y20 Final Communiqué can be read here . Y20 delegates gave serious consideration in determining the Y20 perspective and the global voice of the youth, which, as mentioned, stands at nearly half of the world's population.
This weekend, G20 leaders should levy the same attention to half the planet.
The Young Diplomats of Canada and the Canadian Y20 Delegation, in collaboration with our global partners, call on the G20 leaders to adopt the Y20 Final Communiqué as a commitment of the G20, in whole or in part, and to pursue the following key policy objectives to help solve the problem of youth unemployment.
At the national level and in order to prevent the realization of a "lost generation" and stimulate the national and global economy, the Canadian Y20 Delegation calls upon the Government of Canada to:
Embed entrepreneurial learning into all levels of provincial and territorial education to encourage youth entrepreneurship across Canada, especially for young women and girls.
Increase accessibility of federal and provincial government grants and services for young entrepreneurs by making basic information easily accessible to applicants.
Incentivize entrepreneurship through mentorship and coaching and stronger child-care services to promote greater gender equality in the Canadian workforce.
Encourage a Canada-wide free-trade agreement between provinces to ease interprovincial trade barriers and standardize regulations.
At the global level, the Canadian Y20 Delegation urges G20 leaders to:
Improve economic incentives for employers hiring youth in full-time positions or in structured and paid internships through collaboration between governments, banks and the private sector.
Promote political and social engagement by developing and strengthening mechanisms through which youth can participate in and influence decision-making processes. This includes institutionalising youth engagement forums at the local, regional and national levels, including youth representation in public policy deliberations.
The solution to the problem of youth unemployment is part of the greater economic action plan that Canada and other nations are undertaking. To Canada's credit, at the federal and provincial level there have been some youth-specific programs targeted at reducing unemployment in the demographic, such as the Ontario Youth Employment Fund or Canada's Youth Employment Strategy . However, more must be done.
As Canadian young leaders, we urge the Canadian representatives -- our Prime Minister and finance minister -- to make genuine coordinated commitments with other G20 nations to attempt to solve this problem.
The stakes are high and the time for global leadership on youth unemployment is now.

Chicago gets new  more moderatearchbishopBlase Cupich became the archbishop of Chicago, chosen by Pope Francis to replace his more conservative predecessor.
By: Associated Press | Chicago | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:42 am
Blase Cupich became the archbishop of Chicago on Tuesday, chosen by Pope Francis to replace his retiring, more conservative predecessor as the leader of the third-largest US diocese.
The selection of the relatively low-profile Cupich to replace Cardinal Francis George, who is retiring as he battles cancer, is Francis’ first major mark on American Catholic leadership.
George, who had been the spiritual leader of more than 2 million Catholics since 1997, handed Cupich a bishop’s staff and relinquished the chair that symbolises the leadership position.
Observers say the selection of the more moderate Cupich is a signal that Francis wants a pastor to lead the archdiocese, someone who will follow his lead and emphasise mercy and ministering to the poor and create a church that is more welcoming.
The installation of the 65-year-old Cupich – who had been bishop of the Diocese of the northwestern city of Spokane – marks the first time in the history of the Chicago archdiocese that a new archbishop will assume leadership while his predecessor is still alive.
In a ceremony Monday night steeped in tradition and symbolism, Cupich arrived at the Holy Name Cathedral – crowded with hundreds of priests, religious leaders from several faiths and civic leaders – and knocked on the door three times.
Those knocks, symbolic of his request to be admitted into the cathedral, set in motion a process that included a presentation of a garment called an archdiocesan stole that represents an invitation by the priests in the archdiocese to be the pastor.
In his homily Monday night during what is called a Rite of Reception, Cupich said he intends to ratchet down the rhetoric that has driven young people away from religion. And he vowed to take an active role in the community, pushing for immigration reform, taking part in the battle against gangs and gun violence, among other issues.
He voiced support for Pope Francis’ call for leaders in the church to be pastors, and emphasised mercy and reaching out to people instead of just simply lecturing them, to openly communicate with those with whom the church might disagree.
“Jesus invites us, not only to take the risk of leaving our comfort zone, but also to deal with the tension involved in change, not dismissively but in a creative way,” he said. “Pope Francis is giving voice to this invitation in our day… to leave behind the comfort of going the familiar way.”
As he comes to an archdiocese that has shrunk in recent years and been forced to close schools amid declining enrolment, Cupich also spoke of the “formidable task of passing on the faith to the next generation” and his desire to bring young people back to the faith.

BMC prepares to take charge of new roads  flyovers formaintenancePrint
By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:41 am
The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is preparing to take over showpiece roads and flyovers, which the city’s development authority had constructed and commissioned over the past two years, for maintenance.
This would include the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road, with its double-deck flyover, the Milan and Dahisar rail over-bridges, the Sahar elevated road that leads up to the new airport terminal, the Eastern Freeway and flyovers on the Ambedkar Road.
The norm is that agencies in charge of infrastructure creation such as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) are to construct roads and then hand them over to the BMC for maintenance. There have, however, been delays in handing over certain roads and bridges to BMC in the past. This has led to blame-games, with agencies pointing fingers at each other when citizens complain of bad roads during the monsoon.
SVR Srinivas, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have started discussions with MMRDA about taking charge of all flyovers and roads that have been recently constructed, and are in care of the authority, for maintenance such as the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road, Milan Rail over-bridge, the freeway and so on. Some flyovers on the Ambedkar Road are already in BMC’s care, while the rest would also be transferred now. The entire process is likely to take about two months.”
Along with the showpiece projects, BMC is also in the process of taking over the skywalks that MMRDA had constructed, Srinivas said.
“Although the skywalks were constructed a long time ago, they are still with BMC’s care and there is no proper mechanism in place to maintain these,” he added.
With there being very few users, most skywalks around the city have been severely criticised for poor planning and, later, for their lack of maintenance as well, with garbage strewn across the structure at several places.
An MMRDA official, who did not wish to be named, said, “The major work involved in handing over the projects will begin now. We will submit all maps, drawings and other paperwork involved for BMC to understand the project since the organisation will now have to maintain these roads. However, it will take some time for the Eastern Freeway to be handed over to BMC because some work is yet to be completed by us. The development authority is yet to complete the ramps to the Eastern Freeway near Mahul.”

Bombay HC wants surprise checks of toilets in BMCschoolsPrint
By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:39 am
The state government will soon depute two officials to visit at least five Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) schools in each administrative ward in the city, without any prior intimation to the schools, to see whether toilets there are properly maintained and if there are drinking water facilities in these schools. The Bombay High Court gave the directive to the state government on Tuesday.
“We direct the education department of the state government and the urban department to nominate two officials to visit 1292 schools of various wards. These officials nominated by the state government shall conduct surprise inspections of five schools in each ward to ascertain if toilets are maintained properly and drinking water is available,” said Justices A S Oka and A S Gadkari.
The court has stated that a compliance report should be filed by the state government on directions issued by the apex court to various states relating to Right to Education Act. “The affidavits of officials deputed by the state government should also be filed by December 18. The next date of hearing has been kept on December 19,” the court said.
The court was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Bhagvanji Raiyani referring to the issue of toilet facilities in girls’ and boys’ schools under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation . “In the last affidavit filed by BMC, the officer concerned has noted that the facilities of toilets and water is there but have not stated if the BMC officer went to these schools,” the court observed. The lawyer appearing for BMC, however, maintained that BMC officials had,in fact visited these schools. Noting this the court observed that the matter of toilets being made available is not disputed but the matter of whether they are being kept clean will need to be verified.
As per an earlier order, the affidavit in reply filed by MCGM dated 1 July 2013 stated “These respondents have looked into the issue in respect of toilets and water facilities in the schools of MCGM including the private aided, private unaided, Railway and social welfare in the jurisdiction of MCGM. I say that toilets and water facilities are available for boys and girls as per guidelines applicable and as per the type of the school (co-education, boys and girls). These toilets and water rooms are regularly cleaned by the concerned staff.”

JBIMS summer placements offer higher stipend  but fewer firms turn up oncampusPrint
By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:36 am
A rise in the average domestic stipend from Rs 97,000 last year to Rs 1,17,000 this year and offers of diverse and coveted profiles amid a difficult economy in the recently concluded summer placements at the Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies (JBIMS) has set the tone for final placements next year. The highest stipend of Rs 3.35 lakh offered to the 2014-16 batch has also gone up from Rs 2 lakh last year. In all, 117 students were part of the summer placements.
The number of participating companies, however, went down from 71 in 2013 (as against a registration of 75 firms) to 65 (71 had registered) this year.
“The summer placement season at JBIMS concluded on a high note by achieving 100 per cent placements in accordance to the standards set in the previous years. Established recruiters were happy with the talent acquired and faced tough competition from a large number of new recruiters. Students also enjoyed the versatility and flexibility of a comprehensive set of profiles. Two of the most coveted global consulting firms, McKinsey & Co and The Boston Consulting Group, were also a part of the process. The consulting profile also included firms like JLL and DTZ. The junior associate profile was offered in this sector, which is one of the most sought after profiles across B-schools,” said a placement committee member.
With 33 per cent of the students placed in the banking and financial sector, it saw a gamut of profiles being offered, including investment banking, equity research, transaction banking, retail banking, and strategic business development. The companies in this sector were Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Citibank, Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC, ICICI Bank, ING Vysya, Tata Capital, Indiabulls, Met Life, UV Capital, BMR Advisors and HDFC Property Venture.
Students got to pick from diverse roles in sales and marketing in the FMCG sector from majors like Hindustan Unilever Limited, Procter & Gamble, Marico and Colgate-Palmolive. Profiles ranging from market research and data analysis, in addition to the existing sales and marketing profiles, were made in the pharmaceutical industry by Abbott, Merck Pharmaceuticals, BMS, Janssen Pharmaceuticals and DSM. Corporate Finance roles were offered as well by Procter & Gamble and Hindustan Unilever Limited.
A mix of profiles across several domains like real estate, chemical and manufacturing were offered by leading business conglomerates such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Schlumberger, Tata Steel, Raymond, AkzoNobel, Godrej & Boyce, Maersk Shipping, Larsen & Toubro,
Mattel Toys and Coldwell Banker. The roles included strategy, ERP, business process consulting and general management, among others.

Shiv Sena corporator demands helpline forventilatorsPrint
Written by Tabassum Barnagarwala | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:34 am
In an attempt to ease woes of patients who have to go from one hospital to another in search of a ventilator, a Shiv Sena corporator sent a letter to public health committee chairman, Geeta Gawli, Monday with the request to launch a toll-free helpline number for ventilators in civic-run hospitals.
While this issue was listed in the point of order for Tuesday’s health committee meeting, with the meeting adjourned, the suggestion will now be taken up in the next meeting.
“I have been approached by several patients who are denied admission by the public hospitals, citing long waiting lists as the reason.
While they are promised a call if a bed becomes available, that call never really comes,” Dr Anuradha Pednekar, who suggested the helpline.
With the rise in dengue admissions in hospitals across the city, the demand for ventilators has gone up. Patients with dengue fever often require ventilator support once their organs are attacked by the virus. The already scarce ventilator beds in tertiary-care KEM, Nair and Sion hospitals are running full to their capacity, said Pednekar. She added, “If patients are managed between various hospitals depending on the ventilator availability, several lives can be saved, which are otherwise lost due to delay in intensive treatment.”
According to her, with a helpline number, several patients can call and know which hospital has a ventilator free or they can register themselves in the waiting list for ventilators.

Bombay HC gives last chance to state to take a call on CCTVs inside policelock-upsPrint
Written by Aamir Khan | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:29 am
The Bombay High Court Tuesday offered a “last chance” to the state government and asked the state to take a decision on the installation of CCTVs inside police stations, a move that is aimed at curbing police torture and custodial deaths.
Following state government’s response seeking time in the light of the formation of a new government, amicus curiae and one of the petitioner’s lawyer, Dr Yug Chaudhry told the HC that there have been more custodial deaths in the mean time.
Chaudhry, who appeared for Leonard Valdaris, whose 24-year-old son Agnelo was allegedly tortured and killed in police custody, said the government in the process of installing CCTVs in the reception area. Agnelo and three others, including a minor, were also allegedly sexually abused in the lock-up.
The court had transferred the probe in the case to the CBI.
“Who is answerable when more deaths take place in the meantime,” said Chaudhry.
Justices V M Kanade and Anuja Prabhudessai were hearing a bunch of petitions raising issue of custodial deaths in police stations.
In one of the matters, Chaudhry said the state had admitted “on affidavit” it was a custodial death and even went on to suspend five policemen, but had not provided compensation. The affidavit did not even have the medical papers till the post-mortem stage, he argued.
“Atleast you take a decision and tell us that you have taken a decision,” the HC said, while four weeks’ time to the state government. The judges also directed the state to produce all medical papers of the victim in of the cases.
The court had earlier observed that if a person dies in police custody and injuries are found on his body, an FIR must be registered immediately and action should be taken against the perpetrators of the offence. The court had further said that a magisterial inquiry must be initiated to ensure no evidence is tampered with.
The court also directed the state government to appoint a special public prosecutor, assisted by a woman prosecutor, to try such cases.

Use of women guards on hold at Guantanamos Camp7A judge is putting off resolution of dispute over use of female guards in highest security unit of Guantanamo Bay.
By: Associated Press | Miami | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:28 am
A military judge is putting off a resolution of a dispute over the use of female guards in the highest security unit of the Guantanamo Bay prison.
Navy Captain J K  Waits agreed on Tuesday to delay a hearing until January at the request of lawyers for an alleged al-Qaida commander. Lawyers for Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi asked to put it off because of delays collecting evidence.
Al-Iraqi is held with other top prisoners in the secret unit on the US base in Cuba known as Camp 7. Some of the prisoners have refused to meet with their lawyers unless the military only uses male guards to move them. Prisoners say physical contact with female guards violates with their Muslim faith.
The judge left a temporary ban in place over government objections.

No reason to call Modi  claims Nanavati  turns in his 2002 riotsreportPrint
(Retd) Justice Nanavati.
Written by Parimal A Dabhi | Gandhinagar | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:27 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 9:57 pm
Justice (retd) GT Nanavati has indicated that he did not find any justification to summon the then chief minister Narendra Modi to examine his role in the Gujarat riots of 2002, even though the CM and his Cabinet were included in his probe commission’s terms of reference.
2002 Gujarat riots: Nanavati Commission submits final report to Anandiben Patel
Asked why he did not summon Modi, Nanavati told The Indian Express, “The question is, is there a justification to call anybody?”
Nanavati, who heads the two-member commission, submitted its final inquiry report into the post-Godhra riots to Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel at her official residence on Tuesday. The report was submitted 12 years and 25 extensions after the commission was appointed by the Modi-led state government on March 6, 2002.
Apart from Nanavati, the former Supreme Court judge, the commission includes retired Gujarat High Court judge Akshay Mehta.
Speaking after submitting the report, Nanavati also responded to the late president K R Narayanan’s allegation of a conspiracy between the Centre and the state to perpetrate the riots. “When some allegations are there and you are called upon to produce the documents and you don’t produce it, what does it mean? It means the allegation does not appear to be true,” Nanavati said.
In an interview to Malayalam magazine “Manava Samskriti” in 2005, Narayanan had accused the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of inaction and said that he had written several letters to the prime minister to take action during the riots but in vain.
The Nanavati commission had called for copies of the letters from Rashtrapati Bhavan which, however, denied the request citing security reasons. Narayanan repeated the allegations in a letter to the commission on April 8, 2005.
Three years later, on September 18, 2008, the commission submitted its first report, which gave Modi a clean chit.
Nanavati refused to comment on the contents of the final report but admitted that there was some delay in submitting it. The reasons, he said, have been dealt with in the report, which runs into more than 2,000 pages and has been divided into 10 volumes “for the sake of convenience”.
In the 12 years of its inquiry, the commission received more than 50,000 affidavits. And, even before the first report was submitted, the second member of the original commission Justice (retd) K G Shah died in 2008 and was replaced by Justice (retd) Mehta.
Responding to a question on why the commission did not obtain a lawyer’s services, Nanavati said, “The government did not appoint one although the commission wanted it for some reasons. These were issues which were to be decided at the time of the appointment of the commission. Unfortunately, I was not at the commission when it was appointed.”
The Gujarat government had initially set up a one-man commission of Justice (retd) Shah to probe the riots but later added Nanavati following criticism.
The commission’s first report had also faced flak after continued…

Ganja-preneurs  find funds on TV show
Buy a Car in a Half Hour It Can HappenBuy a car in a half hour? It can happen
Phil LeBeau CNBC
What if buying a car was as simple as going on Amazon.com and buying a large  screen TV?
AutoNation believes that day will soon be here.
CARLOS BARRIA / Reuters
What if buying a car was as simple as going on Amazon.com and buying a large screen TV? One dealer believes that day will soon be here.
The country's largest auto dealer is launching a new service called  SmartChoice Express, promising customers they can pick out the car or truck they  want, fill out the paper work at home and then make a short visit to their  AutoNation dealer where the vehicle will be waiting.
"When the customer arrives, they walk in and there is the car they reserved,"  said Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation. "They have a printout of what they agreed  to for the price and it just makes a very easy, seamless experience for our  customers."
Jackson hopes he can take one of the biggest negatives for car buyers,  visiting and dealing with an auto sales people, and turn it into a competitive  advantage for AutoNation. 
"They don't want to have to drag themselves from store to store," said  Jackson when asked if he realized how frustrated car shoppers are with auto  dealerships.
For most Americans, buying a car is their second biggest purchase after  buying a home. Given that many people now opt to rent instead of buy a house,  maybe purchasing a vehicle is the biggest financial decision many people will  make.
Are they ready to do most of the buying and paperwork online before they even  get to a dealer?
Jesse Toprak, chief analyst with Cars.com thinks so.
Video: Parents magazine’s Dana Points and Philip Reed of Edmunds.com join TODAY to offer advice on buying the right car for your needs.
"I think what AutoNation is offering will appeal to a lot of people," said  Toprak who saw a demonstration of SmartChoice Express at an AutoNation  dealership in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. 
"Car buyers are tired of spending two or three hours in a dealership, this  might be a better option for people used to buying so many things online," he  said.
Buying online
Here's how AutoNation's SmartChoice Express works.
Customers go to the AutoNation website and look at all the cars in the  company's inventory. With 277 stores spread across America selling more than a  half million vehicles last year, AutoNation believes it has the inventory to  meet the desires of 95 percent of those looking for a new or used  vehicle.
Once you find the model you want with the features you want, you can begin  negotiating or haggling for the price you are willing to pay.
AutoNation will have staff standing by ready to negotiate, though the company  believes the pricing it offers will be competitive and close to the final  transaction price.
Once customers have settled on a price, they can handle much of the paper  work, including setting up financing by working through the SmartChoice Express  web site.
Depending on the location of the vehicle you bought, AutoNation will tell you  when it will be at your nearest AutoNation dealership.
If you have all of your paper work signed in advance, AutoNation believes it  can have you in and out with your new vehicle in under a half hour. Those  working trade-ins or who have specific issues they want to discuss with the  dealer will take a little longer.
Jackson believes going online is the way more and more cars and trucks will  be bought and sold in the future.
"When you come to the store, the only thing that is left is the enjoyable  part of the experience," he said. "If you want to make a change we can quickly  do that for you, but you are empowered. We know everything that you have done  online and you are going to have a very convenient easy and enjoyable  experience."
Will car buying really be enjoyable?
While Jackson and AutoNation are trying to take the stress out of buying a  new car or truck, the process is far from pleasant for millions.
Why?
Some of it is because spending thousands of dollars is not a normal a normal  every day experience. Some of it also surrounds the fact that the paper work and  discussions that go with buying a vehicle and setting up financing is often  drawn out for hours.
Finally, many auto dealerships have hurt themselves by hiring sales people  who lack the people and customer relations skills buyers want.
Toprak believes AutoNation could help change that experience for  millions.
"If they can make buying a car online and picking it up in person seamless  and smooth, then this could give them a competitive advantage," he said.
AutoNation will start rolling out the SmartChoice Express service at  dealerships in southern Florida on December 11th and then expand to other stores  next year.

Masses and audiencesThe intolerance towards young film-viewers also comes out of the male gaze that dominates Kerala. (Source: IFFK Facebook page)
Written by H Shaji | Posted: November 18, 2014 12:15 am | Updated: November 18, 2014 8:24 am
The International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), into its 19th edition this year, is in the limelight for all the wrong reasons. With just a month to go for the festival, the organisers have been accused of promoting elitism and excluding local viewers. Ironically, the man at the centre of the controversy is renowned director Adoor Gopalakrishnan, who in 2002 freed the IFFK from the clutches of the festival bureaucracy when he headed the Kerala Chalachithra Academy, the festival host.
Last week, ahead of opening the registration for delegates to the fest, an advisory panel headed by Gopalakrishnan suggested that only mature and serious filmgoers with some “experience” in movie watching be allowed entry to the fest. Prospective delegates were asked to fill in a form where they were grilled about the subject of their studies, the number of times they have attended IFFK, and also to state whether they were members of any trade body or film society. One also had to name three favourite movies and directors and answer why she wished to become a delegate of the IFFK. Most importantly, first-timers were officially discouraged, provoking well-known writer N.S.
Madhavan to tweet: Catch 22 of our times! (To see IFFK you can’t be a first-timer. To not be a first-timer you got to first see IFFK). As traditional and social media erupted over a perceived attempt to exclude the “masses”, the Kerala government stepped in to restore order. On Saturday, three days after Gopalakrishnan triggered the controversy by announcing his panel’s recommendations, the state minister for film promised that all those who applied for delegate passes would be obliged. Tempers have been calmed, but the issues flagged off by the panel are alive. The big question is: Who should be allowed to participate in a film festival? Should the masses be allowed entry on a first-come basis, or should it be limited to a trained audience? These questions are important for the IFFK. Its last edition attracted 9,800 delegates, in contrast to the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa, which is open to only 3,500 delegates.
Until 2002, entry to the IFFK was restricted by invites. The plight of film-lovers was similar to those who would scrounge for passes when the IFFI used to be held at the Siri Fort Complex in New Delhi. As in Delhi, bureaucrats controlled the distribution of passes in Kerala, while cinephiles waited outside theatres wondering how to gain entry and films would often be screened in empty auditoriums. The only solace was enterprising students, who made fake passes and distributed them.
In 2002, Gopalakrishnan introduced a system whereby anyone could pay a fee and watch movies. The move invited severe criticism from some quarters, with the cinema elite lamenting that even head-load workers were now being allowed to enter the IFFK. But with inventive continued…

End of strategic autonomyMany Indian decision-makers argue that defence cooperation with other countries endangers India’s sovereignty. (Source: PTI)
Written by David Brewster | Posted: November 18, 2014 12:16 am | Updated: November 18, 2014 8:25 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attendance at the Asean and G-20 summits caps a busy few months of travel that have included bilateral summits with Japan, the US and now Australia. Modi is the face of a newly confident India that is not afraid of doing deals — sometimes tough deals — with new partners across the economic, political and military spectrum.
Since the end of the Cold War, we have seen big changes in the way India looks at the world. For one thing, India realised that its quest for economic autarchy had been a mistake. In the decades after Independence, India discouraged foreign trade and investment in an attempt to become self-reliant. But policies that sounded desirable only led to economic stagnation and caused India to be less powerful, not more. In contrast, many countries in East Asia connected themselves deeply into the global system, which helped them develop their economies and strengthen their national power.
It is now broadly accepted that the path to a strong India lies through globalisation and economic interconnectedness. Modi was elected on a platform of strengthening India’s economy through more trade and more foreign investment. But even though economic autarchy has been thrown into the dustbin of history, many Indian decision-makers still cling fast to old ideas of strategic autonomy as an excuse to keep other countries at arm’s length. They argue that defence cooperation with other countries somehow endangers India’s sovereignty and that India should try to act alone on the international stage. To them, sovereignty is a sacred object that must be kept in a box.
This view of the world contrasts with the way most countries now promote strategic interconnectedness to enhance their power and influence, and indeed their sovereignty. Of course, the United States came to this understanding some 75 years ago and it is now skilled at using interconnectedness to enhance its influence.
But many other nations, large and small, now use strategic interconnectedness to leverage their power and punch above their weight. This reflects a world in which few countries — even the US — can achieve much by themselves in the international arena. The new norm is of ad hoc coalitions of states that come together to address a particular problem or achieve a specific objective. And in these coalitions, the countries that will wield the greatest influence are those that have the fewest inhibitions in working with others.
In the future, a nation’s power will be increasingly measured by its ability to mould, join and sometimes lead international coalitions to respond to unpredictable events and crises. But it requires considerable organisational and political flexibility and, most of all, close strategic relationships with a range of partners that have worked together in the past and know that they will work together in future. This capability will be of critical importance to India as it aspires continued…

Walker may serve his whole termBy Jennifer Rubin November 18 Follow @JRubinBlogger
Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker gives a thumbs up as he speaks at his campaign party on Nov. 4. (Morry Gash/Associated Press)
It is starting to look like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) isn’t going to jump into the presidential race. In addition to opining that you have to be “crazy” to run for president, he is  quoted as saying , politicians “should run for president not because they want to be or yearn to be, but because they feel called to. Right now, I still feel called to be the governor of the state of Wisconsin, and I’m going to do the best job I can over the next four years.”
He may disappoint some conservatives, who see him as a solid choice appealing both to the mainstream and the hard right and as an able campaigner with a reform agenda. But, somewhat reluctantly, I acknowledge, he may be right. For starters, after his third run in four years he would need to gear up almost immediately for a presidential run. That may not be appealing to him, nor good for the electorate. Constant campaign mode leaves less time for good governance and for policy reflection.
Moreover, in eight years he will still be only 55 — a dozen years younger than Hillary Clinton will be in 2016. He has time, and that time can be productively spent in several ways, most clearly in traveling and brushing up on foreign policy. It is not something much on the radar screen in Wisconsin state government, but it is critical if he wants to seek higher office. As governor he can travel with a support team, get briefings and become as comfortable with those issues as he is state issues. The extra time will also allow him to develop a broader agenda in Wisconsin beyond his two top issues, taxes and collective bargaining reform.
And, lastly, he has time to mature as a public speaker. He is not bad now either on the stump or in interviews, but he can do more to project emotion. Voters want that connection to politicians, especially ones they elect to high office. There is no better, low risk-way to practice than campaigning for someone else.
And while he survived a fundraising onslaught from Big Labor, the amount of money he would have to raise in a presidential race and the donor network he would have to develop would make his gubernatorial expenditures seem like pocket change.
To be sure, Walker did not slam the door to a run entirely, and he could well be on the short list for vice president when the race gets to that stage. But one does have to admire someone who is not so driven by ambition that he would stiff the voters right after a victory and dash out the door in search of the presidency when he has so much more to do and to learn.
A premature runs for the president can have a disastrous impact on one’s career and stature, so if Walker wants to be really ready and as prepared as he can be, he would, I have to agree, be smart to wait. Frankly, it’s a sign of humility and good character, both in short supply inside the Beltway, to know when to avoid the spotlight … at least for a little while.

1. Yahoo News' Chris Moody went surfing with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D). Apparently more exciting trips with elected official are on the way, too.
I went out to visit Gabbard during summer recess as part of a new Yahoo News series called Extreme Recess to document how some of Congress’ more colorful characters spend their time at home. The House and Senate chambers are filled with more than just boring suits. Hidden behind the veneer of Beltway stuffiness is a body thriving with surfers, white-water kayakers, rock climbers, stunt pilots and more.
2. Ken Vogel and Byron Tau at Politico write about how opposition research seems to have sucked all of the policy out of the 2014 midterms.
In an election in which candidates have mostly dodged the big issues facing the country, the dark art known as “oppo” seems to be filling the void. And the trend lines suggest oppo’s golden age may just be beginning.
3. Our own Colby Itkowitz rounds up the best outtakes from CIA performance reviews.
4. The White House isn't calling the plan to combat ISIS a war. The quibbles over semantics are  making things confusing.
“Calling in airstrikes is just as much combat as firing a rifle at someone,” said John A. Nagl, a retired lieutenant colonel who served in a tank battalion in Iraq and helped write the Army’s counterinsurgency field manual. “What that guy really is doing is painting a house with a laser designator that results in that house being vaporized.”
5. NPR looks at the long-term electoral calculus of voting "no" on the White House's Syria plan.
Half a dozen of the 22 "no" votes in the Senate this week were cast by those in both parties who have been mentioned as prospective candidates for president in 2016.
You could say it came down to a ranking of each senator's ambitions in terms of time frame: the politics of the moment competing with those of the near future and the down-the-road.
6. Today in great headlines: " Michele Bachmann Asks Al Franken to Help Defeat Al Franken ."
7. Hillary Clinton has been everywhere lately, but she hasn't given anyone much to write about. Does it matter ?
The story was a reminder that Clinton does inspire passion in some people, or did at one time. The Clinton-boosting super PAC  Ready for Hillary  has signed up more than 2.5 million supporters. Thousands flocked to the Iowa steak fry, if only to catch a glimpse of someone very famous. As Dave Weigel  noted , Clinton's boringness is mostly a problem for the press, not the public.

“There is going to be a lot of weeping and gnashing of teeth around my house,” said Mike Davis, a lawyer and Nationals fan who lives just over the District of Columbia line in Maryland. His son, Chris, loves the Orioles. “I am very disappointed in him,” he said, noting sheepishly that Chris is, um, 6.

RBI Guv Raghuram Rajan wants focus on sustainable economic growth'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
India will focus on sustainable economic growth and developed economies should do the same, central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday.
The Reserve Bank of India is under corporate and government pressure to bring down interest rates and boost economic growth.
“We have to make sure that across the world we focus on sensible, sustainable sources of growth,” Rajan told reporters in Mauritius on Tuesday.
“Developing countries understand that very well … It is something that Mauritius is trying to do, it is also something that India is trying to do. It is something that even the developed world has to realise it has to do.”
India’s economy has grown at less than 5 percent  for the last two years. It picked up some momentum to grow 5.7 percent in the June quarter, but this is still way below the near double-digit growth last seen in 2008.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley suggested on Monday the bank could consider a rate cut, noting slower inflation.
However, Rajan has been focussed on achieving 6 percent inflation by January 2016 and most analysts do not expect a cut when he makes his next policy annoucement on Dec. 2. Rajan has often emphasised that sustained economic growth requires inflation to fall and stay low.
India’s consumer price inflation slowed to 5.52 percent in October on lower food and fuel prices, but is expected to inch up after December as comparisons become less striking.
“Lots of work to do to get India back on a strong growth path. The government has been putting together a series of reforms which I think cumulatively amount to big reforms. The central bank is putting together reforms. My sense is we will do what it takes,” Rajan said.

After Vodafone setback  Income-Tax department loses Rs 18 000 cr transfer pricing case against Shell India'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
On the heels of it losing a similar case against telecom major Vodafone, the Income-Tax department lost its Rs 18,000-crore transfer pricing cases against oil major Shell India at the Bombay High Court, which today quashed the department’s tax order.
The tax sleuths had added Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 3,000 crore respectively to the taxable income of Shell India Markets Pvt Ltd, the Indian subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, for the FY 2007-08 and FY 2008-09 in two transfer pricing cases.
The judgement comes in the wake of two similar transfer pricing cases, which were ruled in favour of the Indian subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc, in which the I-T department had sought adjustments of over Rs 4,500 crore last month.
The order in favour of Shell India was passed today by a bench of justices M S Sanklecha and S C Gupte on a petition filed by Shell India Markets.
Transfer pricing tax orders of Income Tax against Shell and Vodafone pertain to alleged undervaluation of shares issued by their domestic subsidiaries to the parent companies abroad.
Transfer pricing refers to the practice of arm’s length pricing for transactions between group companies based in different countries to ensure that a fair price one that would have been charged to an unrelated party is levied.
Shell India had issued 870 million shares to Shell Gas BV in March 2009 at Rs 10 per share. However, the Income Tax department contended that the shares were grossly undervalued and it valued them at Rs 180 per share. The department then added the difference to the taxable income of Shell India.
In a separate development this year, the Income Tax department had issued a show-cause notice adding another Rs 3,100 crore to Shell India’s income for FY 2009 in another transfer pricing case.
Being aggrieved, the company moved the Bombay High Court challenging the tax notice.
Funding a subsidiary by issuing shares is a common practice among multi-national companies which view this as a capital transaction and out of the transfer pricing bracket.
However, the tax department argues that such a deal is a transfer pricing arrangement by which the shares issued are undervalued and hence the company is liable to pay tax on the income generated out of it.
The high court did not agree with the department and quashed its order and show-cause notice against Shell India.
Welcoming the high court judgement, Shell India termed it as a “positive outcome”.
“We welcome the High Court decision. Shell has always maintained that equity infusion by a foreign parent company into an Indian subsidiary cannot be taxed as income. This is a positive outcome which should provide a further boost to the government initiatives to improve the investment climate,” a Shell India spokesman said in an e-mail statement.
Commenting on the Shell case verdict, Mukesh Butani, managing partner at law firm BMR Legal, which represented the British oil major in the case said, “The HC decision is a significant development and it follows the earlier judgement in the Vodafone case wherein it was ruled that in so far as transfer pricing principles are concerned the issuance of shares by an Indian company to its foreign parent is not eligible to transfer pricing provisions as there is no income arising therefrom.
“The High Court has held that the legal principle laid down by the Bombay HC applies in the Shell case and rejected the IT department’s argument that the facts of Shell case were distinguishable from the Vodafone case,” he said, adding the decision is a welcome relief not just for Shell India but for all MNCs who are facing the adjustment on share issuance.
It is significant to note that the court did not hesitate on exercising its extraordinary powers to issue a writ where alternate appeal remedy was available– in this situation as the court felt that the tax department clearly exceeded its jurisdiction to bring to tax a capital transaction,” Butani said.
Gokul Chaudhri of BMR said the high court decisively held that no transfer pricing or tax implications can arise on issue of shares by a subsidiary to its overseas shareholders. Upholding the writ petition of Shell India the court brought to a close the controversy that arose in January 2013 and has since worried investors.
“This decision follows earlier decision of the court in similar circumstances for Vodafone India. Investors should welcome this bold intervention and clear thinking of the court. Hopefully one of the tax thorns that troubled investors has been removed. Acceptance of this decision by the government would be helpful to bring closure,” Chaudhri said.

Nokia unveils N1 tablet an Apple iPadlookalikeHuffington Post launches in India, sets sights on China
So, the Nokia brand isn’t dead yet. Just a week after Microsoft de-hyphenated the Nokia name from its smart devices, the original Nokia in Finland has showcased the N1 tablet under its own brand. The 7.9-inch Nokia N1 looks a lot like the new Apple iPad Air, even though it runs Android Lolipop but with Nokia Z launcher. The gesture-based Nokia Z launcher has been available as a free download on Google Play store for a few months now.
Considering that it is Nokia’s return in more ways than one, the choice of a tablet, that too one that looks too much like the iPad seems a bit of a surprise now. In fact, the only thing that is visbly different from the Apple device is the Android OS inside. Nokia sees to have stuck to its old naming pattern by calling the tablet the N1. The device, to be manufactured by Foxconn, will be launched in China first at a price of $249 and will launch in Europe starting with Russia.
The one-piece design with surface anodised aluminum will remind buyers of the iPad. The tablet will be powered by a 2.3GHz Intel 64-bit Atom Z3580 Processor and will have 2GB LPDDR3 (800 MHz). The 7.9-inch screen will have a 4:3 aspect ratio and 2048×1536 resolution IPS panel and protected by Gorilla glass 3. The tablet will have an internal storage of 32GB and Micro-USB port for charging. There will be an 8 MP rear-facing camera with autofocus, 5 MP front-facing camera with fixed focus and 1080p video recording. The 318g weight and 6.9mm thickness should make the tablet very sleek.

Hidden Camera Shows How Well Hotel Maids CleanEmail
When you check into a hotel room, you assume the maid has cleaned everything, including changing the sheets and disinfecting the bathroom. But a hidden camera investigation revealed that may not always be the case.
The Rossen Reports team booked rooms for two nights at some of the most popular hotel chains and rigged them with cameras (all three of the hotels were in northeastern New Jersey). In each case they put soda in the glasses, threw towels on the bathroom floors and made the rooms looked used before calling to have housekeeping make them up, as well as prominently displaying the card requesting that all linens be changed.
Video: To see just how much (and how little) some hotel maids really clean, the Rossen Reports team booked rooms at several popular hotel rooms and rigged them with hidden cameras. NBC national investigative correspondent Jeff Rossen reports.
At a DoubleTree hotel (part of Hilton Worldwide), the cameras recorded a maid stripping the bed while putting the pillows off to one side. She replaced the sheets with fresh ones, but after a quick fluff, the same pillows went right back on the bed. 
The maid also scrubbed everything down in the bathroom. Then she used a towel to dry the toilet and the shower, and used the same towel to quickly scrub the counter — the same place a guest would put their toothbrush.
Similarly, at a Holiday Inn, the maid changed the sheets but not the pillowcases, also putting the used pillows back on the bed. Upon viewing the hidden camera footage, Jacob Tomsky, a former hotel housekeeping supervisor and author of "Heads in Beds: A Reckless Memoir of Hotels, Hustles, and So-Called Hospitality," said: "Housekeepers should change the pillowcases, obviously. That's where you put your face. That's what you sleep on."
Tomsky added: "What really bothered me was that she put the pillowcase on a dirty chair prior to putting it back on the bed. That just gets it even more dirty."
At a Crowne Plaza hotel, the maid collected all the used drinking glasses, put them into the sink, and turned on the water. Then she gathered all the dirty towels from the bathroom floor, held onto one, and used it to help dry the cups.
The Crowne Plaza maid then used the same towel to wipe down the countertop, the toilet and the bathtub. She never used soap on anything, but she did return to spray the room with air freshener. 
In a statement to NBC News, InterContinental Hotels Group, the company that owns Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn, said "health, safety and comfort" are "top priorities." It said it "performs regular inspections" and is working to "review ... standards." 
TODAY
Hidden cameras captured hotel maids at work.
The DoubleTree hotel also provided a statement to NBC News, in which it said "cleanliness ... is a focal point of our operations" and that management has "procedures and guidelines in place" to make sure things are "sanitized properly." The hotel said it plans to conduct a review and "address any infractions."
Acknowledging that hotel maids may be cleaning 15, 20 or 30 rooms every day, Tomsky said, "Management should stay vigilant and check and make sure that they have everything they need to do the job.
"Any human being is going to miss something here or there," he added. "That's why these [kinds of] spot checks are good."
None of the top blankets or comforters at the hotels Rossen Reports tested was changed. Experts advise travelers to be specific: Call housekeeping when you get in and tell them, "Please change all the bedding, including the pillowcases" or "We used the glasses, can you bring fresh cups?" Better still, they suggest, use the plastic cups that are wrapped instead.
Full statement to NBC News regarding Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn:
"IHG, owner of the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza brands, holds the health, safety and comfort of our guests and employees as our top priorities and sets stringent quality standards for all hotels bearing our brand names. The two hotels in question are franchised properties, which are independently owned and operated under a license agreement with an IHG affiliate. The license agreements require hotels to comply with all governmental laws and regulations, including those regarding the health and safety of guests and employees, and IHG performs regular inspections of all properties. IHG takes this report seriously. We are working directly with both properties to review cleanliness brand standards and are planning site visits within the next week to determine what future action is needed by the hotels."
Statement from DoubleTree Hilton:
"We expect all of our hotels to abide by our brand standards and we have a robust quality assurance program to enforce our standards and expectations around hotel quality and service. Customer feedback also informs our quality assurance process.  We will follow up with hotel ownership and management if it is confirmed that it failed to follow quality standards. "
Statement from DoubleTree Hilton franchisee in Fort Lee, New Jersey:
"The well-being, safety and security of our guests are of paramount importance at the DoubleTree by Hilton Fort Lee. Cleanliness of our hotel is always a focal point of our operations in order to continue providing guests with an optimal hotel experience. We do not take these issues lightly.
We have procedures and guidelines in place regarding the cleaning of guest rooms. If the linen card is placed on the bed, all bed sheets and pillowcases should be changed. When that guest checks out, the duvet is also laundered. Our procedures also make sure the bathrooms are sanitized properly in accordance with health laws and our own high standards. Once we have viewed the video, we will be able to understand exactly what has happened and will address any infractions with the employee in question."

Now you can send money over Snapchat  tooBy Hayley Tsukayama November 18 Follow @htsuka
Snapchat announced Monday that it  (Photo by: Jens Büttner/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images)
Snapchat lets you send friends videos, pictures and, now, your share of the brunch bill. On Monday, the company unveiled "Snapcash" --- a feature in its app that lets you send money from your debit card straight to your Snapchat contacts.
Snapchat announced the new option  on its blog and in a glitzy, almost Busby Berkeley-style musical message to users:
 
Users will be able to tie their Snapchat accounts to their debit cards, and essentially text cash between them. When someone types in, for example, "$15" in the Snapchat app, a green button will show up giving them the option to send that amount to their friend.   According to TechCrunch, if the recipient doesn't take the money within 24 hours, it's refunded back to your account. The feature is currently in the Android app and is coming soon to iOS.
Snapcash is a pretty direct competitive move on the mobile payments application Venmo, which also makes it easy to send payments to friends by phone. The service is popular among young adults, particularly college students -- or, basically the exact same audience that Snapchat targets. It could be hard for Snapchat to crack into the market, but it does have the advantage of being able to tap into an existing user base.
But wait, you may say, hasn't Snapchat had some privacy and  security issues in the past? Would I want to trust them with my cash? To address some of those concerns, it may comfort you to know that Snapchat itself is not handling any of the actual financial information here -- it's passing all of that on to mobile payments company Square.
The move tips Square's hand a bit more as the company looks to expand its foothold in the increasingly competitive space of mobile payments. It's certainly not alone in looking to make mobile payments something that the average person actually feels safe doing. The Apple Pay program, for example, gets its gravitas from partnering with big banks and big brands -- not the least of which is its own.
But Square, particularly with the Snapchat deal, is in some ways hitting that goal from the other direction -- by gathering a coalition of smaller businesses and services that probably no one had ever thought to wrap payments into to spread its brand. Square also announced Tuesday that it will begin letting its vendors sell physical gift cards to their stores -- meaning that you could theoretically get a gift card to that cute little stall at the farmers market. As with the Snapchat agreement, Square is handling all of the financial transactions for these small vendors, and promises no transaction, subscription or redemption fees.
If the features work safely and easily, then this could be the beginning of several beautiful friendships for Square.

Uber can no longer distinguish between being disruptive and being a jerk( 5chw4r7z )
Silicon Valley is not representative of the broader United States, for many reasons. But it does reflect a core American value: That great ideas and hard work will be rewarded with success. In the case of Uber, "hard work" means doing warfare with incumbent taxi drivers. At first, it was easy for the public to like Uber; everyone loves an underdog story.
But with time,  coverage of the company has become more critical -- and in some cases, openly hostile. Now a top Uber executive  has suggested that the company use the substantial data it collects about its users and teams of outside opposition researchers to "dig up dirt" on journalists who've written negatively about it. Although the executive, Emil Michael, later said he regrets his remarks and didn't mean them (a sentiment echoed by chief executive Travis Kalanick ), the unforced error is part of a broader pattern. Here's what it reveals: Uber is seemingly unable to grasp the difference between fighting the establishment and making enemies of everybody.
Women who use Uber have complained that the company has not done enough to address  creepy drivers who give them unwanted sexual attention. The company's drivers complain that it  takes a disproportionate share of money  from each ride, meaning some drivers barely break even ; some have even revolted over the pay. The company  used dozens of customers' locations , in real-time, without their permission, for a party trick, according to some reports. And, of course, Uber was accused of  attempting to poach Lyft drivers in a crafty move aimed at undermining a rival. In the latest incident, Michael singled out an individual journalist for potential retribution, hinting that he wanted to "prove a particular and very specific claim" about the personal life of Pandodaily writer Sarah Lacy. (A company spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.)
Writing for Gawker, Max Read snarkily points out that Uber's behavior resembles that of many companies that have made it in America. If Uber didn't get its hands dirty, what kind of business would it be then?
But even such a dim view of the C-suite glosses over something unique about Uber: It's practically bred to make other people angry and uncomfortable. Or, as Bloomberg View 's Katie Benner put it, "the posture of antagonism is embedded in the company’s culture." Conflict isn't a tactic for Uber. It's a worldview.
That worldview doesn't come from nowhere. It's borne out of the company's need to beat back unfriendly regulations in cities as well as efforts by taxi companies to destabilize it before Uber can become a threat. Uber is very good at playing this game: It employs teams of lobbyists to advocate on its behalf, and this year it hired former Obama adviser  David Plouffe to help plan its next moves.
Uber's success has come in spite of playing by the taxi industry's rules, not because of it. But the company shouldn't confuse its popularity among consumers with an endorsement of its ethics.
The trouble with justifying a worldview on the rhetoric of disruption is that it legitimates behavior that, by definition, cuts against ideas held by the majority. The majority may not always be right, but a good disrupter knows which norms are worth violating. Privacy norms don't need disrupting. Journalism may need disrupting in a lot of ways, sure, but blackmail — or jokes about blackmail — probably won't help much.
Uber is an indiscriminate disrupter. But it can't stay that way forever.

Pritzker: Just dumping data sets out there is not usefulBy Nancy Scola November 18 Follow @nancyscola

Launched in 2009, Data.gov was one of the Obama administration's flagship efforts to produce a more open government. But though the site is full of raw data, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker suggests it's not nearly as useful as it could be.
Data.gov was supposed to hold heaps of data created by the federal government as it goes about its day-to-day business, boosting government transparency. And it's worked in some cases. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data stored on the site has given birth to scores of weather apps and countless meteorologists' careers, for example.
But in a visit to the D.C. start-up hub 1776 on Monday, Pritzker said that one of the surprises of becoming secretary of commerce last year was finding that the department didn't have all that much to show for the great heaps of data it had shoveled onto the site.
The Data.gov team housed at the U.S. General Services Administration "called us up and said you haven't been contributing appropriately," Pritzker said. "And so we dumped our 39,000 data sets on Data.gov" -- from lists of people banned from exporting products from the United States  to statistics on shark death rates in the Florida commercial fishing industry .
But that is not enough, she said. "The point is just dumping data sets out there is not useful," said Pritzker. "What we need to do is to figure out a strategy."
Pritzker said the department is pulling together a "SWAT team" with help from U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith to determine "the most exciting" things they can do with the data stored on the site during what remains of the Obama administration's tenure.
"I think what's realistic for Commerce to do in the next two years," said Pritzker, is to attempt three or four "major pilots where we take some of our data sets and figure out: how do we make them public, how do we partner" with the private sector.
The goal of that scaled-back strategy would be to create "templates that then could be replicated throughout the government," said Pritzker, adding that such a move would "take our data capabilities to another level."

Telework fraud hearing: Dem notes IG is himself under scrutinyBy Lisa Rein November 18 Follow @Reinlwapo
A House Democrat on Tuesday questioned whether the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s inspector general could objectively judge whether misconduct among patent examiners is widespread or an an aberration.
Inspector General Todd J. Zinser, a key witness in a joint House hearing on time and attendance abuses discovered last year by an internal review at the patent office, is himself the subject of a congressional investigation. Lawmakers on a House committee alleged early this year that Zinser protected his top deputies when they were accused of intimidating staffers who sought to report potentially damaging information about him.
“Rather than investigate those issues raised to you by whistleblowers, you actually sent those allegations back to the agency to investigate,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren said, accusing Zinser of a “blemished history in your treatment of whistleblowers.”
The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology called on Zinser to immediately remove two top deputies who, investigators said, coerced whistleblowers into signing gag orders when they had complaints about Zinser.
It was four whistleblowers who triggered the internal review by patent officials by calling the inspector general hotline in 2012 with allegations that examiners were getting paid for work they didn’t do.
Zinser said his office “has no problem receiving and investigating whistleblower complaints.”
Asked why he passed the allegations onto patent officials instead of having his office investigate, he said the patent office “has not taken ownership of the problems reported to our department.”
“The management needed to hear them and address them properly. That’s why we sent them to the agency to investigate.”
The joint hearing of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the House Judiciary Committee ended about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday.

IIMA hikes fee by 11.5%  other IIMs likely tofollowPrint
By: Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:35 am
The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA) has increased fees for three of its core academic programmes by around 11.5% percent for the batch commencing April 2015. The hike comes after two years.
Following the academic review, the IIMA flagship programme, Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP) added three new core courses — ‘Government System & Processes’, ‘Understanding Global Organisational Context’ and ‘Having an Entrepreneurial Mindset’ along with a slew of flexi-courses and specialisations on the cards. This indicates a paradigm shift in the IIM-A which used to focus on preparing its candidates for corporate jobs. The last decade saw a good number of IIM-A graduates chucking plum jobs to launch their own enterprises and some joining the government. Social sector and the government seems to be high on IIMA’s radar with the advent of illustrious alumni like India’s Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian and RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan.
Other IIMs are likely to follow suit and announce a fee hike as well, affecting lakhs of CAT aspirants and professionals . IIMA Director Ashish Nanda on Monday cited “cost pressures” and the need “to remain financially autonomous” as reasons for the hike.
The hike is from Rs 16.6 lakh to Rs 18.5 lakh. The fees for the Post-Graduate Programme in Management for Executives has been hiked from Rs 21.5 lakh to Rs 24 lakh.
“We have been holding the fee constant for two years which has led to our being pretty competitive in comparison to other institutes. The last fee hike for PGP was done in 2011-13, while for the PGPX it was 3 years back. For the PGP and PGP-ABM programs, the tuition fee increase is 10%, whereas administrative costs (for hostel, facilities, academic support ) have been increased at a higher pace owing to inflation.The cumulative fee increase for all three programs of the order of about 11.5%, equates to about 3.7% annual increase over three years. However, we also have one of the most generous financial aid policies and are making revisions to it, so that no capable student is unable to fund his studies,” he said.
In the last two years, IIMA has disbursed financial aid worth Rs 7.55 crore to 295 students in 2012-13 and Rs 6.94 crore to 242 students in 2013-14. However, Nanda added that IIMA was looking for government support for its Fellow Programme in Management.
New students can look forward to a spate of changes at IIMA ,including seats for foreign nationals under ‘supernumerary system’ and ‘deferred admissions’.

7 Ways to Stop Student Loans From Ruining Your Life7 ways to stop student loans from ruining your life
Julie Halpert Special to CNBC.com
Nov. 18, 2014 at 9:53 AM ET
Email
It's not surprising that 7 million students in the U.S. defaulted on their college loans during the third quarter of 2014, according to the  Department of Education. The average amount of loan default per borrower:  $14,014.
An October report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau saw a 38  percent jump in complaints over 2013 from students who took out private loans to  finance college. The common theme among the 5,300 who filed complaints was that  lenders were inflexible about providing alternative payment options for those  facing financial hardship, so many were driven into default.  
Jonathan Gibby / for NBC News
Many students are in precarious situations when it comes to repaying college debt. It is a dire situation, since student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.
Many students are in precarious situations when it comes to repaying college  debt. It is a dire situation, since student loans cannot be discharged in  bankruptcy.
Following are some tips from college financial experts on steps to take  before, during and after college to help ensure that your debt load remains  manageable so it doesn't ruin your life.
1. Find a college that fits your budget.
Prioritize the schools that are most affordable to you so you can limit  your borrowing, said Rick Ross, co-founder of College Financing Group, which  assists families with the college financial-aid process. If you're eyeing a  college that costs $50,000 and provides the same quality of education as one  that costs $25,000, don't head to the pricier institution, he said.
It's best to determine in advance how much you will spend in total on  college and how much you're willing to borrow, said Justin Draeger, president of  the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. He said that  every school is required to include a net price calculator on their website that  provides a rough estimate of how much financial aid you would receive, given  your income. And consider the field you're entering and how much you're likely  to earn once you graduate. An engineering student is more likely to be able to  afford higher loan payments than a social worker, for example.
Video: President Obama is expanding a 2010 law that based payments on a borrower’s income, but left out people with older loans. The move could make repayment easier for an additional 5 million people.
Read More Reducing college costs  could mean the end of textbooks
A typical guideline is not to borrow more than what you anticipate earning in  your first or second year after graduation. Peter Mazareas, co-founder of Invite  Education, said those considering lower-paying professions may be better off at  a public institution, which is less expensive. Another option, he said, is to  look to schools that offer merit aid, which doesn't need to be repaid.
Abbey Stauffer, general manager of education for NerdWallet, a personal  finance website, added that students should borrow wisely, taking out only  what's needed to cover tuition, fees, room and board and avoiding the temptation  to max out the loan in order to have "fun money."
2. Start making interest payments while in college.
Though loan payments are not due until six months after graduation, the  interest on unsubsidized Stafford loans begins to accrue immediately. Ross said  that can multiply quickly, adding another $3,000 to a $25,000 loan. He suggests  making payments quarterly throughout college and considering paying back some of  the loan early as well, since reducing the principal ultimately results in a  lower balance that reduces the overall interest payments over time. There's no  penalty for early payment for both federal and private loans.
3. Take advantage of the various federal loan repayment  options.
Repayment is much more accommodating with the federal loans, "since there are  repayment provisions based on income that are very helpful for borrowers who are  underemployed or unemployed, whereas private lenders are reluctant to offer such  repayment plans," said Heather Jarvis, an attorney specializing in student-loan  training and education and the founder of askheatherjarvis.com. "You almost have  to go out of your way to default on a federal loan," she said.

There are still many students who aren't aware of relatively recent repayment  plans that could help them, said Ross. These include:
Income-based repayment is an option that became available in 2009. It looks  at a borrower's adjusted gross income based on tax returns and makes a  calculation based on that income and the borrower's family size to arrive at a  discretionary income figure, then sets the monthly payments at 15 percent of the  discretionary income amount. If the loan cannot be repaid in 25 years, the  remaining balance is forgiven. A pay-as-you-earn option, which has been  available since 2012, is similar, but instead of 15 percent of the discretionary  income, it's set at 10 percent and the loan is forgiven after 20 years if not  paid. The payments are lower, and there is earlier forgiveness.
Under a graduated repayment plan, the borrower starts off with a lower  payment that increases over time. Ross said that graduated repayments are better  for public employees, where they have some sort of union contract, so they can  accurately predict their future salary. But Jarvis said that for many, it's  safer to choose an income-driven plan that ties payments to actual, rather than  projected, income.
Those experiencing severe financial difficulties, like the lack of a job,  can request forbearance to postpone the required monthly payments and avoid  default. It delays the repayment period, but interest continues to accrue, so  it's costlier in the long run. Borrowers also can opt for partial forbearance,  where they make interest-only payments while the monthly payments are  deferred.
4. Choose loans that offer the best repayment plans.
The takeaway on the Consumer Financial Protection Report is that you're  better off getting federal, not private, loans. Federal loans "are cheaper and  have significantly more protection," said Rohit Chopra, Student Loan Ombudsman  for the CFPB. Even though federal Stafford loans are available to those of all  income levels, 55 percent of those who took on private loans in 2008 had not  exhausted their limit under the federal loans, according to the CFPB report.
Read More Can your college major  guarantee a job?
Stauffer said the reason could be the perception that you need to meet a  certain income limit in order to be eligible for federal loans, but that's not  true. While subsidized Stafford loans do require an income limit, unsubsidized  Stafford loans do not. Parent Plus loans, which are available to parents wanting  to borrow for their child's education, also do not have an income limit, so  anyone can apply for a federal loan.
Stauffer urges those needing to finance a portion of their education to  complete the federal student aid application, called the FAFSA. "Submitting this  is the single most important thing you can do to start the process of borrowing  for school wisely," she said. It's also often used as the basis for awarding  merit aid by schools.
5. Realize some loans offer forgiveness.
The Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program allows students who have taught five  consecutive years in a low-income K through 12 district to get up to $17,500 in  Stafford loans canceled. Public service loan forgiveness pardons what you owe  after working 10 years full-time in a public service job.
6. Consolidate your private loans.
Under private loans, interest rates are based on a borrower's credit rating,  so this might be an option for parents who have a good credit score and can get  a low interest rate, said Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president and publisher  of Edvisors.com.
If you have many private student loans with double-digit interest rates, it  might be worthwhile to consider a private loan consolidation to reduce those  interest rates, Ross said.
Video: A panel of personal finance experts, Jean Chatzky, Farnoosh Torabi and Lynnette Khalfani Cox, discuss why it’s important to boost your emergency find, give the best way to consolidate loans and reveal whether a 529 account is a good college investment.
7. Don't let the debt get you down.
If you're encountering financial difficulties, it's important to speak with  your lender about alternatives before you default, Kantrowitz said, since you lose options if you default first. He said that if you present lenders with  compelling reasons for why you can't repay the debt—like if you have a  disability or skyrocketing medical expenses—even private lenders can be  accommodating. They may offer interest-rate reductions and extended repayment  terms, for instance.
Draeger added that with federal loans, given the number of protections and  deferments, "there are dozens of ways that students can just keep their loans in  good standing without ever having to go into  delinquency."

JUST HOURS (AND DOLLARS) TO GO: California teen aims to crowd-fund her class trip to D.C. through comics(courtesy of Jemima Jagger-Wells)
 
THIS MUCH IS CLEAR: Jemima Jagger-Wells, a Northern California eighth-grader with an artistic eye, is smarter than I was at her age.
Like Jemima, I was once a Bay Area-sprung middle-schooler trying to figure out how to fund my cross-coastal class trip to the nation’s capital. And like Jemima, I was an aspiring maker of words and pictures, having already cartooned professionally for a newspaper.
That’s where the similarities end, though, because I raised the needed dough by kneading dough — selling handmade pizzas when not washing cars.
Jemima, on the other hand, is savvily taking advantage of being 13 in 2014: She is aiming to raise the needed $2,500 for her class’s New York/Washington trip by crowdfunding the money through the sales of her comics.
So far, with just a half-day to go, Jemima is about $600 short of her crowdfunding goal.
Moved partly by my own memories of what a profoundly great experience this trip can be, Comic Riffs caught up with Jemima to talk about her inspiration for this. And if you find yourself inspired by her idea, the link is here :
MICHAEL CAVNA: How long have you liked to make comics, Jemima?
JEMIMA JAGGER-WELLS: My dad is an artist and my mom is a writer, so my talents are kind of mixed. Ever since I was little, I’ve always loved to draw but I’ve never done an actual comic until now. It’s pretty new and, like I always have with art, I get a lot of advice fom my dad.
MC: Are there artists who particularly inspire you? And do hope to be a professional artist when you grow up – and if so, any idea what kind?
JJ-W: These are really the first comics I’ve ever done. I’m still working on accurately drawing people and developing my style, but I doodle on everything I touch. When I was younger, I used to read “Little Nemo” by Winsor McCay, “Calvin and Hobbes” by Bill Watterson, and “Tintin” by Hergé. More recently, I got into the “Amulet” series by Kazu Kibuishi, and read “Page by Paige” by Laura Lee Gulledge. But out if all of these artists, I’m probably most inspired by my dad. I don’t think I’ll be a professional artist, although I would like to be a professional writer. At this point, I honestly have no idea what I’ll grow up to be but I do know that, professionally or not, I’ll be drawing my whole life.
MC: When I was about your age, even though I was already making comics, I relied on car washes and pizza sales to fund my class trip from California to Washington, D.C. Are your traveling classmates going the traditional route with their funding, or do they have their own creative ways to pay for this?
JJ-W: At my school, almost everyone is selling See’s chocolate bars to raise money. There are a few kids whose parents are paying for the full $2,800, and some kids who aren’t even attempting to raise enough money. One girl is also doing an Indiegogo, although as far as I know, I’m the only one selling comics. My school is pretty big, so I can’t be the only one raising money creatively, but most people are just using the chocolates.
MC: Was has the response to your campaign been like so far? Are you hearing from people across the country, if not globally, and are they encouraging you — or requesting different kinds of comics?
JJ-W: For the first part of my campaign, I was mostly getting donations from my friends and family. Then, a little while ago, my dad sent a link to BoingBoing. … After that, strangers across the country started donating. I got a few comments saying how people were inspired by my idea to sell comics and how when they were my age, they had to do car washes and other boring things to raise money.
MC: What would you say to readers of this column in order to convince them to donate to your campaign? If you were making a direct appeal, what’s your pitch?
JJ-W: I live in a part of California that is fairly new [by history standards] and doesn’t have a lot of history to speak of. D.C., on the other hand, is, and always has been, the center of our nation. It is richer in history then almost anywhere in America. This trip is such an amazing opportunity to learn about America with some of my best friends, and I know I won’t get another one like it. Anything anyone can do, whether it’s donating, buying a comic, or spreading the word would be greatly appreciated.
MC: Anything else readers should know about this campaign?
JJ-W: I am giving everyone who contributes the option to say who they would vote for for our first female president. People can comment their vote on my Indiegogo and after the campaign is over, I will make a comic about the winning candidate. It only takes a dollar to vote, but you can still vote if you donate more and get a bigger perk.
I would also like people to know that even after my Indiegogo is over, I will continue raising money through etsy and anything else I can think of. My main focus will switch to my website: getmetodc.tumblr.com.

Nature Wants Her Carbon Backreddit
By looking down, things are looking up.
Here's a little known fact about climate change: According to NOAA, if we could magically cut all current CO2 emissions worldwide to zero today (a feat even Merlin couldn't achieve) it would do nothing to stop climate change from continuing to get worse for centuries. Unless we actually draw some of the carbon already emitted back down to earth we are simply telling a 400-pound patient to gain weight a little more slowly.
Amazingly, however, doing so may be significantly easier than reducing emissions. According to a steadily increasing number of studies, it turns out we can blow by the goal of slowing climate change and actually reverse it. While we've all been looking to the atmosphere and the amounts of CO2 we emit into it for the answer, the solution itself may be right under our feet. In the dirt.
According to the latest research from Ohio State University's Rattan Lal, Texas A&M's Richard Teague, IFOAM's Andre Leu (as reported in the UN paper "Wake Up Before It's Too Late" ( UN ) and the Rodale Institute anywhere from one-third to one-half of manmade CO2 in the atmosphere comes from industrial agriculture. That's more than all the emissions from the burning of fossil fuels worldwide. How is it possible that with the entire planet focusing on reducing CO2 emissions we're not even paying lip service to the single largest contributor? ( Rodale )
But that's only half of the story. To makes matters worse, industrial agriculture compounds the problem by preventing soil from reabsorbing that carbon, thus trapping it in the atmosphere.
To understand how, it's important to remember a few simple facts: There is no waste in nature (she reuses everything); We don't create carbon (we just move it from place to place); and, nature is literally dying to take back the excess carbon we put into the atmosphere and reuse it to grow us more stuff.
So why isn't nature doing this? Turns out that our mistreatment of soil is preventing nature from doing what she does naturally and cycling carbon back from the atmosphere. We are literally disrupting the process of photosynthesis -- where plants break CO2 molecules apart, release the oxygen and take the carbon underground -- by killing the life that should exist in soil that needs that carbon. We do this by spraying it with chemicals, tilling and killing the latticework of fungi, and growing one plant in a field when nature needs variety the same way we need proteins and fats and fruits and vegetables to remain healthy.
Those same studies report that transforming even a small part of industrial agriculture land to healthier, regenerative methods can lead to sequestering more than 100% of current CO2 emissions in just three years. And everything the soil sequesters that's above what we're currently emitting will come from -- you guessed it -- the excess in the atmosphere. That means we are literally beginning to reverse climate change in just a few years. Re-open the pathways, draw down the carbon. ( Drawdown )
But haven't we been told we'll all starve to death without industrial agriculture? Absolutely, and by some of the same people who tell us the science is still out on climate change. The science shows quite the opposite. In fact, regenerative farming yields are equal to industrial yields in normal weather, and superior to them in stress times of drought and flooding. So we're not simply reversing climate change, we are creating more food, and more food security. ( IFOAM Report )
Currently we have over 400 PPM of carbon in the atmosphere. We have been told we need to stay below 350 to maintain a livable planet. New data, however, report that every 1% of organic matter added to our farming and grazing soil reduces the PPM by 50. Studies have also shown that we could literally return the atmosphere to pre-Industrial Age conditions in as little as twenty years ( Drawdown ) -- the Chinese government studies say it may be forty, but I'd take that deal happily.
The Industrial Revolution lead to explosions in human development, and Industrial Agriculture has enabled us to feed a population that went from one billion to over seven virtually overnight.
But now we know that an unintended consequence of how we fed those people is climate change. Just like it is with how we've produced energy. Fortunately, we also now know that we don't need to continue to use these destructive techniques to feed and power the same amount of people.
Need more proof? Nature's done this before. During the Cambrian period, and in other volcanic times, the earth saw levels of 600 to as much as 7,000 PPM. And every time, without humans messing up the process, the carbon was reabsorbed into the soil and created an explosion of plant growth. So think abundance, not starvation.
One final point -- this is not a license to continue polluting and letting nature deal with it. It's a gift of time. Time to transform into a carbon-neutral society while also dealing with climate change.
Nature wants to do this. In fact, nature needs to do this. If we let her the planet, and we humans, can all breathe easier.

Latest tweaks give Kuznetsov a little more skill to play withBy Alex Prewitt November 18 Follow @alex_prewitt
(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)
GLENDALE, Ariz. – With the Washington Capitals moving toward full health among their forwards corps — Brooks Laich (shoulder) and Liam O’Brien (lower body) are the lone holdouts — Coach Barry Trotz flanked center Evgeny Kuznetsov with new linemates, a move he hoped would give the 22-year-old “a little more skill to play with.”
As Trotz seeks to build a lineup that can roll four deep , deploying Kuznetsov with Eric Fehr and Chris Brown for Tuesday night’s matchup against Arizona seemed like a reasonable starting point.
“You’ve got a shooter, and a guy that can — basically they both can shoot, but they both can make plays. Fehrsie can also take some draws for him too when he needs,” Trotz said. “I think that might be something he’ll have to do.”
In 16 games this season , officially his rookie year by NHL standards, Kuznetsov has won just 41.9 percent of draws, including 37.0 percent on the road and 32.0 percent in the offensive zone, according to Faceoffs.net . Having aggressive skaters like Brown and Fehr could also help Kuznetsov, a skilled puckhandler, produce some more offense beyond his two points at even strength, both assists.
“We need him,” Trotz said of Kuznetsov. “He’s a good young player. Power-play wise he’s pretty good on that half-wall, as good as anybody his age. It’s important to try to keep him going forward.”
True to form, when asked about his new linemates, Kuznetsov pivoted the conversation to the team at-large, which has scored only one goal over the past two games, both losses.
“We’ll see in the game,” Kuznetsov said. “We’ll talk before the game, how we need to play today. It’s going to be good. Tough game today, and we need a win. Phoenix is good team. A lot of skilled players. And we’re good too. We lose a couple games, but no worry, no problem. If team win, everybody happy. Good feeling coming into next game and you feel better and better. We need a win.”
The forward lines during Washington’s morning skate at Gila River Arena looked as follows, with Michael Latta the apparent scratch:
Alex Ovechkin—Nicklas Backstrom—Tom Wilson
Marcus Johansson—Andre Burakovsky—Troy Brouwer
Jason Chimera—Jay Beagle—Joel Ward
Chris Brown—Evgeny Kuznetsov—Eric Fehr
INJURY NOTES: O’Brien did not participate in the morning skate and will not face the Coyotes. Laich did, though Trotz predicted “a very outside chance” of the forward returning from his left shoulder injury on Thursday in Colorado.
“We’re hoping maybe next week we see Brooks Laich back in the lineup and we can sort of get some order back in our lines,” Trotz said. “Having Wilson back, people like that, will be helpful.”
Defenseman Dmitry Orlov (wrist) and forward Aaron Volpatti (neck) both skated with the team as well.

People in Peru are drinking an endangered species: Frog juice. For the (supposed) health benefits.By Peter Holley November 18 Follow @peterjholley

The Titicaca water frog is very large and entirely aquatic and makes its home in the high-altitude rivers that flow into Andean lake for which it is named.
In addition to being named a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the frog, according to the Associated Press , is also believed by some Peruvians and Bolivians to be a cure for human maladies as wide ranging and seemingly unrelated as asthma, osteoporosis, fatigue and a low libido.
So say some Peruvians who make a habit of turning the amphibians into "juice."
"I always come to drink frog juice here because it's good for the children," Cecilia Cahuana told the AP at a frog-juice bar in Lima. "For anemia, bronchitis and also good for older persons."
If you've never, ever wanted to see the words "frog" and "juice" blended together in a single, stomach-churning phrase, we can assure you that you're not alone. And if drinking an endangered species wasn't enough, here's another reason you might want to pass the next time someone (most likely a Peruvian someone) offers you a glass of frothy green goo.
"There is no scientific evidence confirming any medicinal benefits from frog juice," according to the AP.
Tomy Villanueva, dean of the Medical College of Lima, told the AP that "the frog juice has not met the standards of the FDA to be mentioned as medicine."
Still, if you'd really like to try some for yourself, here's a how-to via the AP.
To make the mix at her food stand in Peru's capital, vendor Maria Elena Cruz grabs a frog from a small aquarium, and whacks its head on the countertop until it's dead.
Then she peels off its skin and drops the frog into a blender with carrots, the Peruvian maca root and honey.
The juice comes out light green in color. Cruz serves it in glasses to her customers.

Varsity strikes down students demand to end parkingfeeStudents can pay Rs 50, Rs 300 and Rs 500, as monthly, half-yearly or yearly charges respectively. No charges will be levied on bi-cycles.
By: Express News Service | Pune | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:42 am
Despite a demand from students to abolish parking charges in colleges, the Savitribai Phule Pune University has decided to continue with the practice, though it has modified the parking charges to make it uniform across colleges.
Students can pay Rs 50, Rs 300 and Rs 500, as monthly, half-yearly or yearly charges respectively. No charges will be levied on bi-cycles.
The Management Council meeting of the university, in a meeting on Tuesday, accepted the report of a panel led by Ashok Chaskar, dean, on the parking issue.
Students from Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC), Abasaheb Garware College, Sir Parshuram among other colleges had in August protested against parking fee. They contended that educational institutes could not ask them to shell out money for parking vehicles as they receive grants for parking stands.
Following the protest, the university set up a panel under Chaskar and asked colleges and other stakeholders to submit feedback on parking charges, security of vehicle parked, condition of parking place and monthly and biannual passes issued to students.
Speaking with Newsline on Tuesday, Chaskar defended the move of continuing with parking charges.
“It is true that colleges are entitled to grants for raising the parking stand, but all colleges do not get get such aid. Several educational institutes do not have their own space for parking facility. Colleges spend money on appointing contractors, hiring parking space and carrying out maintenance. This has to be compensated for by a minimal fee for parking,” he said.
Chaskar said parking charges so far did not have uniformity and now it has been rationalised. The university received around 80 suggestions on the parking issue, he added.
Mohammad Saif, a student from Fergusson College said university Vice-Chancellor Wasudeo Gade had himself termed parking charges on campuses as “illegal’. “During our meeting with the V-C, he was considerate to our demand for abolishing parking charges. Despite this, the university decided to go ahead with parking charges. We hope the decision will at least benefit students of colleges where parking charges are very high,” he said.
A student, Sidharth Sharma said the university had ignored students’ interest. BMCC principal Chandrakant Rawal said parking is a need of students and colleges should resolve parking difficulties.
At present, charges at colleges range from Rs 2 to Rs 10 a day. Private contractors disown responsibility of vehicles parked. Facilities are lacking at parking stands. These were issues students raised during their agitation. University authorities say these concerns would be addressed. The new parking charges fixed by the university would be applicable to all 600 affiliated colleges.

Why Airfares Are Rising Despite Lower Fuel Costs
Keystone XL: Mary Landrieus final indignityBy Aaron Blake November 18 Follow @aaronblakewp

Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) has participated in a keg stand . She has run this desperate ad . She lost an energy committee chairmanship that she often touted, when the GOP took the Senate on Nov. 4. She has clashed -- in front of reporters -- with a leader of her party . That same party basically abandoned her in her runoff campaign for a fourth term.
But on Tuesday, she suffered the biggest indignity of her 2014 campaign, and possibly of her political career.
Landrieu, reduced to a relatively pointless gambit to demonstrate her clout in Washington, failed to secure the 60 votes required to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. She came up one vote shy .
This was basically Landrieu's final play. With no party funding for her campaign, she has been drubbed on the airwaves -- as in, exponentially so. And even before that, few gave her much hope in her runoff with Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.).
So in a last-ditch effort to move the needle, she launched the Keystone campaign. Nevermind that the very same bill will probably pass with ease once Republicans take control of the Senate in January. She wanted to prove she could make it happen two months earlier -- because why not.
And Senate Democrats -- who, again, have abandoned her financially -- have now abandoned her in spirit too. The vote wasn't just meaningless because Republicans will pass the bill come next year; it was also meaningless because the White House has basically said it would veto the bill, as the State Department is still reviewing the project.
And despite all of it -- despite the whole dog-and-pony show of the past week -- Democrats couldn't even give Landrieu enough votes to breathe a little life (hypothetically, at least) into her long-shot campaign.
Bloomberg declared last week that Democrats had left " a body on the campaign trail ."
On Tuesday, with Landrieu's assistance, they metaphorically ran over the body with a truck.
And Landrieu, a three-term senator and member of a royal political family from Louisiana, just proved precisely how little clout -- or hope -- she has.
In a tight vote, the Senate rejected the Keystone XL pipeline Tuesday evening, dealing a serious blow to the re-election efforts of Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.). (AP)

Jet pilot takes selfie obsession to cockpitEYE BROWSE
Jet pilot takes selfie obsession to cockpit
The pilot turned the cockpit of the Boeing jet he was flying into a favourite location for selfies, some of which feature him craning out of an open window and posing.
Mail Today –  Tue 18 Nov, 2014
Print
NEW DELHI: In what appears to be an acute case of selfie love, a Jet Airways pilot allowed his friends and colleagues to access the highly sensitive cockpit area and pose for pictures - displaying utter disregard for civil aviation safety guidelines.
The pilot turned the cockpit of the Boeing jet he was flying into a favourite location for selfies, some of which feature him craning out of an open window and posing.
The matter came to light after Sahil Arora, the pilot in question, uploaded the pictures on his Facebook page. Among the many pictures he posted were images of official documents with details of precious items like gold bars that were being ferried in the plane.
In one of the photographs, Arora can be seen posing with crew members for a selfie. In another he is seen with a woman friend as an elderly gentleman occupies the pilot’s seat. Yet another photo shows the same woman fiddling with the cockpit panel.
Most of the photos appear to have been taken on the ground. According to sources, other pilots of the same airline also indulged in such “irresponsible practice”, risking the lives of passengers who flew in the aircraft.
According to the Director General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) guidelines, only a select few are allowed inside the cockpit. Arora’s Facebook page has pictures of a fellow pilot posing with rapper Honey Singh and actor Shah Rukh Khan.
A senior official of the Civil Aviation Department said that apart from the one who pilots the plane, a DGCA inspecting official, an engineer of the airline or trainee pilot are authorised to enter the flight deck.
To face action
When Mail Today sought a response from the DGCA, an official said Arora is liable to face action if he is found guilty.
“It is a very serious issue. He clearly compromised security guidelines. This is totally irresponsible behaviour by this trained pilot, who permitted unauthorised persons to have a bizarre photo shoot inside the cockpit,” said the official of the rank of Deputy Director, who did not want to be named.
“We will serve a show cause notice to Jet Airways and if it is found that there has been a violation of security rules, DGCA may cancel the pilot’s licence,” the official told Mail Today.
After going through Arora’s profile on Facebook, Mail Today found that other pilots of the same airlines have also flouted rules and taken selfies inside the cockpit. In the images, it is clearly visible that pilots and air hostesses of Jet Airways are taking flight operations rather casually.
“In the pictures, crew members earning lakhs of rupees per month as salary are treating the plane like a local bus. They seem unaware that operating a flight is serious business as the lives of so many are in their hands,” a DGCA official said.
Mail Today contacted Jet Airways, but officials denied knowledge of any such incidents.
After the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States, all countries implemented strict rules to restrict entry into the cockpit area.
“It is highly risky to allow anyone inside the cockpit as it is not a place for visitors,” an official said.
Airlines around the world have come to take these rules very seriously after the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH 370.
Fariq Abdul Hamid, the first officer of the missing plane, allowed two female passengers into the cockpit during the flight.
Recently, the DGCA suspended the flying licence of four pilots who allowed their family members inside the cockpit mid-air. The pilot of a third flight, who allowed passengers inside the cockpit of a plane on the verge of take-off, was taken off flying duties.

After notching up losses of Rs 3,000 cr, Spicejet CEO says turnaround in a year after re-capitalisation

Summary
Improving profitability over three quarters makes Spicejet attractive investment…
We will sell empty seats in advance by offering discounts during the lean season: Spicejet (Reuters)

High Court directive to DLF to demolish some portions of complex
Low-cost carrier Spicejet, which has been steadily improving operating performance over the past three quarters, said on Tuesday that it expects to come back to black in a year after it receives fresh capital. The airline, which has accumulated losses of almost Rs 3,000 crore and has a negative net worth of Rs 1,460 crore, is said to be close to clinching an investment deal from an overseas investor, likely from South-east Asia.
The turnaround is slightly delayed because the Kalanithi Maran’s Sun Group promoted airline has returned a few of its older Boeing 737 aircraft over the past few months due to high maintenance costs. This has resulted in a drop in the scale of operations, because of which the cost savings have had a smaller impact.
Sanjiv Kapoor, Spicejet’s COO said that a drop in jet fuel prices will help the airline save Rs 320 crore this fiscal (over FY14). But, if the states reduce the taxes on ATF as is being proposed and jet fuel prices drop a further 3-4% in December, the savings could be over Rs 600 crore.
“We need to re-capitalise given the historic losses, there is no question on that. It will help is get sufficient growth capital and take care of the liabilities. Given our improving operational parameters, I believe many parties are interested in investing in us. There should be no comparison to Kingfisher, because in the last 6 months they had passenger load around 40% and both market share and the product plummeted,” he said.
SpiceJet’s auditor SR Batliboi & Associates has also consistently raised doubts about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, highlighting the need to attract an investor. SpiceJet has delayed payments to various parties, including vendors and statuary authorities.
As compared to July this year, Spicejet has reduced daily flights by about 40 to 300, largely because its fleet of B737 has come down to 28 (26 are operational) from 35. The airline also has a fleet of 15 Bombardier Q400s turboprops for shorter routes, which it hopes to increase to 25 when it receives fresh funds in order to improve economies of scale for maintenance contracts.
“There are a fair number of flights we are removing from our fleet temporarily as part of the fleet restructuring but should be back to normal by December. We should by back to 35 B737s by  December, and 45-50 B737s by second half of 2015,” Kapoor said.
Kapoor further said that on most operational parameters the airline has been doing very well. In Q2FY15 (ending September 30, 2014), Spicejet saw revenue jump 15% YOY, over double of the 7% capacity increase, even as expenses fell 2%. Load factors were up 19%, while CASK (cost per available seat KM) fell 7%. In the quarter, the airline had reduced net losses by 45% to Rs 310 crore – this included a Rs 75 crore one-off restructuring cost.
The Spicejet scrip at the BSE closed 4.12% up at Rs 14.39 on Tuesday.

BJP government s stability not NCP s responsibility: PawarBy: Press Trust of India | Alibaug | Posted: November 18, 2014 3:54 pm
The Fadnavis government Tuesday found itself in an unenviable situation with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, whose party had declared outside support doing a U-turn, saying the stability of the 18-day-old dispensation was not its responsibility and asking his party workers to be ready for a snap poll.
“Having a stable government in Maharashtra isn’t NCP’s responsibility. We have to be ready to face snap polls in Maharashtra,” Pawar said addressing a two-day meeting of the party which got underway Tuesday at Alibaug in Raigad district. “The present situation in Maharashtra is not of long term political stability. If the political instability continues, then in four to six months the state may have to face polls and that will not be good for Maharashtra,” the Maratha strongman said.
After declaring unconditional outside support to the minority BJP government the day Assembly poll threw up a hung verdict, NCP has been showing signs of a rethink in the party over continuing support to the Devendra Fadnavis government. Pawar’s remarks come within a week of Fadnavis securing a controversial trust vote in the Assembly where the confidence motion was passed by a voice vote in complete chaos.
NCP MLAs were reported to have remained seated quietly in their seats when the motion was put to a voice vote and declared passed. Shiv Sena and Congress had disapproved of the procedure and petitioned the Governor to direct the government to seek a trust vote afresh.
Sharad Pawar had earlier said he doubted that the first BJP government in Maharashtra will last its full term, while his nephew and former Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, too, frowned upon the way the minority government had secured the trust vote.

Akash missile successfully test fired for second dayBy: Press Trust of India | Balasore | Posted: November 18, 2014 5:02 pm
For the second consecutive day, India on Tuesday successfully test-fired its indigenously developed surface-to-air ‘Akash’ missile from a test range in Odisha as part of user trial by the air force. The trial of the missile was ‘fully successful’, said ITR director M V K V Prasad adding it hit a para-barrel target. The test-fire was a practice and evaluation trial for a new squadron and a repeat performance as the medium range missile had been test-fired successfully on Monday from the same test range.
“Some more similar trials of the missile will be conducted in this week,” he said. Defence sources said the missile was test-fired from launch complex-3 of the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur at about 3.22 PM.
‘Akash’ missile is a medium range surface-to-air anti-aircraft defence system with a strike range of 25 km and can carry a warhead of 60 kg. It has the capability to target aircraft up to 30 km away and is packed with a battery that can track and attack several targets simultaneously. With its capability to neutralise aerial targets like fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles, defence experts compare ‘Akash’ to the similar weapons of many
other advanced countries, the sources said.
‘Akash’ has been developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as part of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. While the air force version has already been inducted, the army version is in the final stage of induction, the defence sources said.

Lalu Yadav is an expired medicine  says PaswanBy: Press Trust of India | Lucknow | Posted: November 18, 2014 6:24 pm
Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan on Wednesday described Lalu Prasad Yadav as an “expired medicine” while reacting to the RJD supremo’s reported statement in which he had said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has become an NRI (Non-Resident Indian).
“Lalu is expiry date medicine,” the Union minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said in reply to a question about Lalu’s comment.
Referring to Prime Minister Modi’s foreign visits, Yadav reportedly said in Ranchi on Wednesday that Modi has now become a Non-Resident Indian.
“He is not the Prime Minister of the country anymore, he has become an NRI and the media is portraying that Modi’s popularity is booming abroad when there is trouble at our borders,” Lalu told reporters.
When posed with a similar question, Paswan’s son and MP Chirag Paswan replied,”Laluji is sick, he should take rest.”

Two cops killed in Meghalaya ambush by suspected GNLA rebelsPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 18, 2014 8:56 pm | Updated: November 18, 2014 9:01 pm
Two policemen were killed on the spot and three others seriously injurd when rebels suspected to belong to the Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA) laid an ambush and blew up one of the two police vehicles in Meghalaya’s South Garo Hills district. The incident occurred at about 2 PM on Wednesday.
A team of police personnel were proceeding from Baghmara, the district headquarters, to Siju police outpost on NH62, when the rebels waiting in ambush triggered off a powerful IED near a village called Rewak, three kms short of Siju.
Meghalaya Police IG (Operations) GHP Raju told The Indian Express over the telephone from Shillong that the rebels took advantage of a patch of bad road about three kms short of Siju, which is about 28 kms from Baghmara, the district headquarters.
While Havildar Aldrin Lyngdoh of the 3rd Meghalaya Police Battalion and armed branch constable Aitom A Sangma were killed on the spot, three other police personnel – Medison Sangma, Betherson M Sangma and Brething K Sangma have sustained serious injuries.
“Our sources said that the incident was the handiwork of a group of GNLA rebels headed by one Hadeo C Momin, who heads the Chokpot area command of the outfit. Momin is a known bomb expert and has been involved in several other IED explosions in South Garo Hills that targeted security forces in the Garo Hills region,” IGP Raju said.
It was only on November 6 that the GNLA commander-in-chief had issued a statement offering reward of Rs 15 lakh to his cadres for targeting security forces. A day earlier, the Meghalaya Police had announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for information leading to the arrest of 10 “most wanted” militant leaders, eight of whom were from the GNLA.
Meanwhile, a massive hunt has been launched jointly by commandos of the Meghalaya Police’s Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) and the Combat Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) to track down the rebels.

Father asks Burdwan blast accused to surrenderPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 18, 2014 8:50 pm
Even as the NIA is on the hunt for Sahanur Alom, one of the 12 “most wanted” in the Burdwan blast case, his 70-year-old father Majibar Rahman has asked his son to surrender. Sahanur Alom, a quack doctor, carries a reward of Rs 5 lakh on his head.
Sahanur’s father Rahman made this appeal to his fugitive son through the media in Barpeta on Tuesday. “I want to appeal to my son, wherever he is hiding now, to come out and surrender to the NIA,” Rahman said.
Sahanur Alom (33) has remained untraced soon after the Burdwan blast occurred on October 2.
Hailing from Chatala village under Sarthebari police station in Barpeta, Sahanur Alom had become part of the Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) after he began visiting different madrasas in West Bengal. While the NIA has sealed several bank accounts in his name, the Assam Police, two weeks ago, arrested his wife Sajina Begum from the Inter-State Bus Terminus in Guwahati.
Meanwhile, the chief judicial magistrate of Kamrup on Tuesday extended the judicial remand of six persons arrested for their alleged link with the jihadi group involved in the Burdwan blast. They are – Shaikhul Islam alias Abdullah (20), Rafikul Islam (39), Md. Shiraj Ali Khan (53), Jahuruddin (60), Golam Usmani (23) and Sarbesh Ali (35) – all hailing from three different villages in Barpeta district. Among them, Shaikhul Islam alias Abdulla of Kahikuchi village in Barpeta is said to be an important member of the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Party of the Mujahideen) sleeper cell in Assam.

Two Palestinians stormed a Jerusalem synagogue on Tuesday, attacking worshippers praying inside with knives, axes and guns, and killing four people before they were killed in a shootout with police, officials said.
The attack, the deadliest in Jerusalem in years, is bound to ratchet up fears of sustained violence in the city, already on edge amid soaring tensions over a contested holy site.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Israel will “respond harshly” to the attack, which he denounced as a “cruel murder of Jews who came to pray and were killed by despicable murderers.”
Israeli police described the assault as a terrorist attack and said the two Palestinian assailants were cousins from east Jerusalem. Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs the Gaza Strip, praised the attack but stopped short of claiming responsibility.
Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said six people were also wounded in the attack, including two police officers. Four of the wounded were reported in serious condition. He said police were searching the area for other suspects.
Associated Press footage from the scene showed the synagogue, in Jerusalem’s ultra-Orthodox Har Nof neighborhood, surrounded by police and rescue workers following the attack.
Wounded worshippers were being assisted by paramedics and a bloodied butcher’s knife lay near the scene of the attack.
“I tried to escape. The man with the knife approached me. There was a chair and table between us … my prayer shawl got caught. I left it there and escaped,” Yossi, who was praying at the synagogue at the time of the attack, told Israeli Channel 2 TV. He declined to give his last name.
A photo in Israeli media from inside the synagogue showed what appeared to be a body on the floor draped in a prayer shawl, with blood smattered nearby.
Police spokeswoman Lubi Samri said the attackers were Palestinians from east Jerusalem, which has been the scene of relentless clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters in recent months.
Jerusalem has seen a spate of attacks by Palestinians against Israelis. At least six people have been killed in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Tel Aviv in recent weeks, prior to Tuesday’s casualties.
Jerusalem residents have already been fearful of what appeared to be lone wolf attacks using cars or knives against pedestrians. But Tuesday’s early morning attack on a synagogue harkens back to the gruesome attacks during the Palestinian uprising of the last decade.
Israel’s police chief said Tuesday’s attack was likely not organized by militant groups, similar to other recent incidents, making it more difficult from security forces to prevent the violence.
“These are individuals that decide to do horrible acts. It’s very continued…

Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe puts off tax hike  calls snap pollJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe speaks during a press conference at his official residence in Tokyo, Tuesday. (Source: AP)
By: AP | Tokyo | Posted: November 18, 2014 5:11 pm
Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called a snap election for December and put off a sales tax hike planned for next year, vowing Tuesday to step down if his strategy to revive the ailing economy falls flat.
Despite Abe’s aggressive revival policies to end two decades of stagnation, the Japanese economy slipped into a recession last quarter after a tax increase in April crushed consumer and business spending. That prompted Abe and other officials to reconsider a second hike planned for October next year.
“I’ve been pondering this problem,” Abe told a news conference. “Even if we raise the tax as planned, tax revenue will not increase if the economy does not recover.”
Abe said he will dissolve parliament on Friday, setting an election for mid-December to seek public approval for his decision, which he said was needed to ensure the success of his “Abenomics” policies of extreme monetary easing, heavy government spending and economic reforms.
“I need to hear the voice of the people,” Abe said. “I will step down if we fail to keep our majority because that would mean our Abenomics is rejected.”
Delaying the tax hike will slow Japan’s work on repairing its tattered public finances. But Abe said the risk to the world’s third-largest economy was a bigger threat.
Fresh elections may seem a puzzling decision given the bad news on the economy. But the Liberal Democrats have a solid majority and hope to further consolidate their power at a time when opposition parties are weak and in disarray.
Abe described his strategies as the “only path” for Japan to escape its economic malaise.
“Some people say Abenomics has failed or it’s not performing well,” he said. “But what else can we do. I have yet to hear of a better idea.”
Japan has bubbled with speculation of an early election since early this month.
Last week, the Liberal Democrats were coaching freshman lawmakers on campaign strategies and opposition parties rushed to discuss possible new alliances. Pre-election debates by party leaders are in the works, and new campaign posters have gone up in Tokyo neighborhoods.
Abe got a rare second term as prime minister, having stepped down just a year into his rocky first term in office in 2006-2007. His support ratings started out high as share prices surged in early 2013. But they have fallen recently. Parliament got bogged down in squabbles over campaign finance scandals that led to resignations of two of his cabinet ministers within weeks of an early September reshuffle.
By dissolving parliament for an election Abe can clear the slate and once again reshuffle his cabinet, said Michael Cucek, a Tokyo-based analyst and fellow at Temple University Japan. He described the sales tax hike and Abe’s policy of lavish fiscal and monetary easing as continued…

Indonesian police criticised over  discriminatory  virginity testsWomen applying to join the force in the world's most populous Muslim-majority country have to undergo the virginity test. (Source: AP photo)
By: Agence-France Presse | Jakarta | Posted: November 18, 2014 9:23 pm | Updated: November 18, 2014 9:36 pm
Human Rights Watch on Wednesday urged Indonesia’s national police to halt “discriminatory” virginity tests for women applying to join the force in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country.
The rights group said women applicants are required to be both unmarried and virgins, and the virginity test is still widely used despite the insistence of some senior police officials that the practice has been discontinued.
In a series of interviews with HRW, young women — including some who underwent the test as recently as this year — described the procedure as painful and traumatic.
The women told how they were forced to strip naked before female medics gave them a “two-finger test” — a practice described by HRW as archaic and discredited.
“I don’t want to remember those bad experiences. It was humiliating,” said one 19-year-woman who took the test in thecity of Pekanbaru, on western Sumatra island, and whose identity was not disclosed.
“Why should we take off our clothes in front of strangers? It is not necessary. I think it should be stopped.”
Nisha Varia, associate women’s rights director at HRW, described the tests as “a discriminatory practice that harms and humiliates women.
“Police authorities in Jakarta need to immediately and  unequivocally abolish the test, and then make certain that all police recruiting stations nationwide stop administering it.”
The tests contravene the police’s own guidelines on recruitment and violate international human rights to equality, non-discrimination and privacy, HRW said.
Police did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
While senior police have insisted in recent years that virginity tests for female applicants have been stopped, HRW said a posting on the force’s own website this month noted that female applicants must undergo the procedure.
Women currently make up about three per cent of the 400,000-strong force, HRW said, but added the police had launched a drive to increase the number of female officers.
Society is deeply conservative in parts of Indonesia and some still value female virginity highly.
The issue hit the headlines last year, when the education chief of a city sparked outrage by suggesting that teenage schoolgirls should undergo virginity tests to enter senior high school.

Syria government bombing kills at least 13The death toll was likely to rise because more people were buried under the rubble.
By: Associated Press | Beirut | Posted: November 18, 2014 5:41 pm | Updated: November 18, 2014 6:01 pm
Activists say that a Syrian military airstrike killed at least 13 people and wounded another 20.
The activist collective, the Aleppo Media Center, and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say military aircraft used “barrel bombs” _ crude bombs made from canisters laden with explosives _ to strike the Qabr al-Inglizi area in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo on Tuesday.
The Observatory said at least 13 were killed, including two children and a woman, and that the death toll was likely to rise because more people were buried under the rubble.
The Syrian military’s use of so-called “barrel bombs” has been widely criticized because they cannot be precisely targeted. They are believed to have killed thousands of civilians.

Some barricades cleared from HK protest sitePrint
Workers start clearing away barricades at an occupied area outside government headquarters in Hong Kong Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2014. The removal comes after a Hong Kong court granted a restraining order against the protesters last week requiring them to clear the area in front of a tower in the central part of Hong Kong as well a separate order against a second protest site Mong Kok brought by taxi and minibus operators. (Source: AP)
By: Associated Press | Hong Kong | Posted: November 18, 2014 2:10 pm
Backed by a court order, workers removed some barricades on Tuesday from a Hong Kong democracy protest site where activists have camped out for nearly two months in a standoff with authorities.
The workers cut plastic ties holding metal barricades together in an area outside the Citic Tower office building and then loaded them into a waiting truck.
Student-led demonstrators, who have been protesting for greater democracy in the former British colony, did not resist. Some had already moved their tents to other parts of the protest zone ahead of the clearance operation, which was observed by dozens of court bailiffs, police officers and reporters.
The protesters oppose the Chinese government’s requirement for a panel of Beijing-friendly elites to screen candidates in the inaugural 2017 election for Hong Kong’s top official. Chinese authorities have declared the gatherings illegal and neither the Hong Kong government nor the student leaders have shown any willingness to compromise.
Leaders of a student group that have played a key role in organizing the street protests say they want to meet with senior Chinese leaders. But when three of them tried to fly to Beijing on Saturday, they were denied boarding because their permits to enter mainland China were invalid. It is unclear what the students plan to do next.
Many protesters suspect that the authorities will resort to more court orders to gradually clear out the protest zones after previous attempts using other methods failed.
“Before they tried to use police to do it, after that they found triads. Now they’re going to use bailiffs and injunctions,” said protester Angelo Heung, a 34-year-old freelance art designer. “They’re going to use legal principles and court orders but we still won’t be afraid.”
On several occasions, police took protesters by surprise as they attempted to dismantle barricades in dawn operations that backfired, drawing more people out into the streets.
Groups of masked men who some suspect were members of triads, or organized crime gangs, have also clashed with protesters as they attempted to remove barricades.
The barricade removal comes after the tower’s owner, Chinese state-owned conglomerate Citic Ltd., continued…

Michigan Tells Gay Couples Their Marriages Basically  Never ExistedMichigan Tells Gay Couples Their Marriages Basically 'Never Existed'
Posted:
reddit
Three hundred couples who tied the knot when Michigan's gay marriage ban was briefly lifted in March have been given a message from the state that, legally, it's as if their marriages never existed at all.
In a 2-1 decision earlier this month , the federal 6th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Michigan’s gay marriage ban along with similar laws in three other states. The case, known as DeBoer vs. Snyder, could now be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court; April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, the Michigan couple who originally sued for the right to marry, appealed to the high court for a reversal of the ruling Monday.
In the meantime, the rights of several hundred same-sex couples are in limbo, and a brief filed in a second, separate court case spearheaded by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan seems to put their marriages in further legal jeopardy. Michigan's Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) filed the brief Friday , arguing that the 6th Circuit decision means the same-sex marriages that were performed in the state “are void and cannot be recognized for any purposes.”
Michigan's ban on gay marriage was first struck down in March by a federal judge ruling on DeBoer vs. Snyder, and the next day, clerks in a handful of counties agreed to perform marriages for same-sex couples. The 6th Circuit quickly issued a stay on the ruling, but not before 300 couples across the state had been married .
As a result, eight of those couples are suing the state and Gov. Rick Snyder (R) in U.S. District Court with the assistance of the ACLU, arguing for their marriages to be recognized . Snyder said this month that while the same-sex marriages that took place in March are legal, they are not eligible for state benefits .
But the brief Schuette filed in the ACLU case Friday seems to contradict part of Snyder's statement, saying the appeals court ruling voids the marriages altogether. He wrote:
The unqualified reversal by the Sixth Circuit in DeBoer nullifies the district court’s decision completely, and it is as if the legal premise upon which Plaintiffs’ marriages are based never existed. Consequently, from a legal standpoint, because the marriages rested solely on the district court’s erroneous decision, which has now been reversed, it is as if the marriages never existed, and Plaintiffs’ requests for benefits attendant to a legal marriage must be denied.
Jay Kaplan, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, strongly disagreed with Schuette’s stance.
“Even the governor has maintained that these were legal marriages,” he told The Huffington Post.
Kaplan further said the 6th Circuit decision on DeBoer vs. Snyder should not have any bearing on the second case, because they’re about two separate things: the right for same-sex couples to get married vs. the right for same-sex couples who are married to receive benefits and have their marriages recognized.
“[In] our case, these people are married, they’re legally married in the state of Michigan. That was the law, they have legal marriage certificates,” Kaplan said. “The federal government recognizes their marriages and is [granting] them full benefits, and the state should do the same.”
Schuette additionally argued that the court should not hear the ACLU case until a final ruling has been made in DeBoer vs. Snyder. If the U.S. Supreme Court decides to hear the case, it could clear the way for a nationwide decision on whether states may ban same-sex marriage.

Periodic intervention by voluntary agencies to rescue bonded workers not withstanding, bonded labour is prevalent in many districts of Tamil Nadu in rice mills, brick kilns and other places.
Details of prevalence of bonded labour, obtained by Evidence, a Madurai-based non-governmental organisation, using the Right to Information Act, for the period from January 2010 to June 2014 reveal that 44 per cent of rescued workers were from Orissa and other northern States.
Most of the released workers belonged to Scheduled Castes and many employers had engaged children in their units. But no arrest had been made during the period even after registration of cases.
According to the RTI data, 864 bonded workers were rescued from nine districts during the period. They included 52 children (below 14 years) and 420 women.
Tiruvallur district accounted for the highest number of 509 bonded labourers, and 379 among them were from North India. Interestingly, there are no bonded workers in The Nilgiris, Theni, Tiruchi, Tiruvarur, Tuticorin, Karur and Dindigul districts as per the data. According to the applicant, data could not be obtained for Cuddalore, Madurai, Nagapattinam, Sivaganga, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram, Ramanathapuram and Krishnagiri districts.
Though the laws are clear that a rescued bonded labour shall get Rs.20,000 and 2.5 cents of land, a survey conducted by Evidence indicates that only six persons among the 864 had received Rs.20,000. As many as 165 rescued labourers got Rs.19,000; three of them were given Rs.2000 each; 690 labourers received just Rs.1,000 and three could get 2.5 cents of land each.
The replies under the RTI Act also showed that 551 persons were engaged in rice mills, 106 in brick kilns, 78 in sugarcane cutting and other menial jobs. According to A. Kadir, executive director, Evidence, 131 cases had been booked against the employers but not a single person had been arrested.

Australia will be at the centre of our thought, says the Prime Minster
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said Australia would not be at the periphery of India’s vision but at the centre of its thought, as he called for closer bilateral security cooperation and a comprehensive global strategy to tackle the menace of terrorism.
Mr. Modi, while addressing the Australian Parliament, the first Indian Prime Minister to do so, said, “It has taken a Prime Minister of India 28 years to come to Australia. It should never have been so. And this will change. Australia will not be at the periphery of our vision, but at the centre of our thought.”
Mr. Modi addressed the Parliament after holding talks with Prime Minister Tony Abbott following which the two countries signed five pacts on social security, transfer of sentenced prisoners, combating narcotics trade, tourism, and arts and culture.
During the talks, the two sides sought an early comprehensive economic partnership agreement.

No German please  were IndianPrint
Written by Ruhi Tewari | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:18 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 8:09 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured Chancellor Angela Merkel that his government would consider how the issue of the scrapping of German as third language in Kendriya Vidyalayas could be resolved within the framework of the Indian system. Ruhi Tewari summarises the controversy.
Why has the HRD Ministry dropped German?
The HRD Ministry says that teaching German as third language, as well as the 2011 MoU between the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (which administers KVs) and Goethe-Institut Max Mueller Bhavan, violate the National Policy on Education, the National Curriculum Framework and the Three-Language Formula.
What is the Three-Language Formula?
That schools must teach Hindi, English and one modern Indian language. The third language should preferably be one of the southern languages in Hindi-speaking states, and the regional language in non-Hindi speaking states. The formula was laid down in 1968, reiterated in the 1986 Education Policy and, again, in 2005.
To which level of school does the formula apply?
The secondary level, which is Classes 6-8.
How did KVs start offering German as a language option?
In 2009, KVS decided to offer German as an additional subject in the curriculum of KVs. Because the course was very popular, it was introduced as a third language option.
Who signed the 2011 MoU?
The KVS commissioner and regional director of Goethe-Institut, in the presence of  E Ahamed, then MoS, HRD, and Cornelia Pieper, then Minister of State, German Federal Foreign Office.
Is the MoU still valid?
It lapsed in September.
So has German been altogether scrapped in KVs?
No. The ministry has said German will continue to be offered as an additional language/hobby class.
How many students are impacted?
Around 70,000 of Classes 6-8 who opted to learn German. Over 500 KVs offer German.
What happens to the teachers?
Goethe-Institut Max Mueller Bhavan has provided over 700 teachers. KVS has said services of teachers recruited on contract would continue.

Modi in 3D  among the massesTechnology can project audience onto this screen. (Source: Express photo)
Written by Adil Akhzer , Arun Sharma | Srinagar/jammu | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:05 am
On Tuesday, the BJP launched three “3D virtual live raths” that will enable people to take a selfie with a projected image of Narendra Modi. It is an experiment tried out in the Lok Sabha polls but which has reached Jammu and Kashmir for the first time. And it is one of a series of technology-driven measures taken up in the BJP campaign in the state.
Flagged off  by former union minister Prof Chaman Lal Gupta in Jammu, these vehicles carry a screen that shows a recording of Narendra Modi delivering a speech. With 3D technology, watchers standing on a wooden platform too are projected onto the screen, creating an impression that they are part of audience with Modi on the platform, and enabling them to take a selfie.
The three vehicles have arrived from Gujarat; two will travel through Jammu region and the third will go to Kashmir. “At every big rally of Kashmir, Modiji will address people using 3D technology,” said Altaf Thakur, the BJP’s media-in-charge for Kashmir. “It will be the first time that any party in the state uses such a van. It will give the impression that PM Modi is among the people.”
The party has launched a cyber cell targeting Kashmiri youth who use social networking sites. A team from Delhi arrived last week to train the Srinagar team. “We are targeting more than 20 lakh people,” said a party source.
An SMS service being launched will provide information about rallies and programmes. Hoardings are being mounted at 177 places identified between Qazigund and Uri.  And a media room is coming up in Srinagar. “The job of the team here will be to respond quickly to any statement issued by any party against the BJP,” Thakur said.

BP fights on to oust oil spill claims chief... 
KEVIN McGILL | November 18, 2014 08:09 PM EST | Associated Press
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — BP is heading to a federal appeals court in its effort to oust the administrator of damage settlement claims arising from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
The company filed notice Tuesday that it plans to file with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
BP has long complained about Patrick Juneau's administration of claims. It sought his removal by a federal judge in motions claiming that he had a conflict of interest because he once represented Louisiana in talks setting up the claims process and had pushed for favorable terms for those with claims.
The company also said he had made misleading statements about that work before being named claims administrator. And they said Juneau improperly expedited claims for some people represented by the plaintiffs' steering committee.
U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier flatly rejected BP's arguments in an order last week. He said Juneau had disclosed his previous work to BP before being selected as administrator. He also said that BP used an out-of-context statement in its accusations against Juneau and that there was no evidence that any claims were improperly expedited.
"BP has appealed that order as it continues its efforts to bring the integrity and transparency to the Gulf claims program that was promised at its inception and that is sorely needed today," BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said in an emailed statement.
In a related development Tuesday, Barbier approved plans for a second round of claims to be paid from a $2.3 billion seafood compensation program. He adopted recommendations from a group of third-party lawyers, referred to throughout his order and the court record as "the Neutrals," recommending disbursement of up to $500 million in seafood claims.
Barbier's latest order comes despite worries from BP about errors and fraud in the seafood compensation program. The judge said there are sufficient safeguards in place to root out fraud and prevent and correct errors.
"In short, BP demands actions beyond what is already being done in the way of fraud investigations, audits, etc.," Barbier wrote. "The Court is well aware of the current procedures and finds that, combined with the recommendations, they are sufficient."
The April 2010 blowout of BP's Macondo well off the southeast Louisiana coast triggered an explosion aboard the rig Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 workers and resulted in millions of gallons of oil spilling into the Gulf for months.
A settlement of oil spill economic-loss claims reached in 2012 once was hailed by all involved but BP has since complained about the interpretation of the settlement and Juneau's running of the claims process.

San Diego advances plan to recycle wastewater...and
versions
SAN DIEGO (AP) — The San Diego City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to advance a $2.5-billion plan to reuse wastewater for drinking, the latest example of how California cities are looking for new supplies amid a severe drought.
The plan calls to initially recycle 15 million gallons by 2023 and 83 million gallons a day by 2035, about one-third of the city's water supply. It enjoys broad support from Mayor Kevin Faulconer, business groups and environmental advocates.
The Orange County Water District, which serves 2.4 million people in California, plans to boost production of recycled water next year from 70 million gallons to 100 million gallons a day. It has reused wastewater for drinking since 2008 through treatment that includes sending water through ground basins.
The Santa Clara Valley Water District, which serves 1.8 million people in the San Francisco Bay area, decided in September to pursue construction of facilities that it says could lead to turning wastewater into drinking water for Sunnyvale and western Santa Clara County.
Still, it remains rare to turn sewage to drinking water. The WateReuse Association, a group of agencies behind the efforts, counts only 10 projects nationwide, including El Paso, Texas, and Fairfax County, Virginia. Two Texas cities, Wichita Falls and Big Spring, started projects within the past two years.
The cost of such undertakings approaches the cost of seawater desalination — another expensive idea that has gained interest during the drought. Recycling,, called toilet-to-tap by critics, has also suffered an image problem that industry insiders call "the yuk factor."
San Diego, a city of 1.4 million people that imports 85 percent of its water from the Colorado River and Northern California, has slowly warmed to the idea. A 2012 survey by the San Diego County Water Authority showed that nearly three of four residents favored turning wastewater into drinking water, up from one of four in a 2005 survey.
"The drought puts a finer point on why this is so necessary," Faulconer said. "Droughts are unfortunately a way of life in California, so we have to be prepared. This helps us to control our own destiny."
The hand of the city was forced partly because its main treatment plant fails to meet federal standards for dumping wastewater in the ocean. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has granted a waiver every five years since 1995, with the latest one set to expire in July.
On Tuesday, the City Council ratified an agreement between the mayor and four environmental groups — San Diego Coastkeeper, Surfrider Foundation, Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation and San Diego Audubon Society — to ask the EPA for another reprieve and to commit to the recycled wastewater plan. Unlike Orange County, San Diego plans to send water through a reservoir because it lacks groundwater basins.
Mehul Patel, Orange County's groundwater replenishment system program manager, said about a dozen agencies from around the world have visited since last year to learn about recycled water. California agencies are increasingly interested because of the drought and prospects for state funding under a $7.5-billion ballot measure that voters approved this month, he said.

Stadium-district casino wins new Philly license...and
versions
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Philadelphia-area gambling market is set to get more competitive now that regulators voted Tuesday to award a license to Live! Hotel & Casino, a joint venture of two Eastern seaboard casino operators to be built in the city's stadium district.
Live! won a four-way competition for the last casino license in eastern Pennsylvania, and the fifth in the Philadelphia region. It will be owned and operated by the Cordish Cos. of Baltimore and Greenwood Gaming & Entertainment Inc., of Bensalem, Pennsylvania.
In a 172-page analysis released a few hours after the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board's unanimous vote, members said they liked the "synergy" between a casino and 8 million sports and music enthusiasts who visit 400 events per year there. It presents an opportunity to market the complex as a year-round attraction, and best satisfies the state's goal of generating more tax revenue from two casinos in Philadelphia, the gaming board wrote.
A casino could take a couple years to build, even if the result is not challenged in court.
Bob Green, Greenwood's chairman, acknowledged fears from competitors that another casino would not draw new gamblers, but rather steal from the ones already there.
"There will be some cannibalization, but I think the market will expand generally," Green told reporters after the half-hour gaming board hearing at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia. "We believe that there is a significant untapped source of revenue" in south Philadelphia's stadium district.
If all goes well with permits from the city, crews could break ground within eight months and open the facility in 15 to 18 months, Green said.
The $400 million Live! Hotel & Casino is expected to house 2,000 slot machines and 125 table games in 200,000 square feet of space, along with an adjoining hotel with 240 rooms and 2,500 parking spaces. It will be built on a lot that currently houses a Holiday Inn just a few hundred feet north of Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies, and a few hundred feet south of Interstate 76. The Holiday Inn will be renovated and incorporated into the casino project. Just to the south of Citizens Bank Park is the XFinity Live! entertainment complex, developed by The Cordish Cos., as well as Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Philadelphia Eagles, and the Wells Fargo Center arena, where the Philadelphia Flyers play.
It was not the most expensive or glamorous project pitched to the gaming board. That was the $700 million French-themed Provence concept proposed by developer Bart Blatstein at the iconic former Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News tower just north of downtown. But gaming board members saw Live! as the most financially stable and reliable revenue machine.
Live! will have to pay $75 million for the slot machine and table game licenses. Its owners expect $344 million in pre-tax revenue in the fifth year of operation.
The decision brought the two-year application process to a close and comes amid casino closings in Atlantic City, increasing competition on the Eastern seaboard and worries that a new casino will siphon gamblers from competitors that can scarcely afford to lose them.
Pennsylvania, which rocketed to the second-largest commercial casino market in 2012, is also feeling the effects of competition from other East Coast states. The state has opened 12 casinos since 2006 — including two, Sugarhouse and Harrah's Philadelphia, each within 12 miles of the stadium casino site — and there is a license for one more available.
But some analysts say the Philadelphia-area market is either saturated already or coming close, and wagering at slot machines, the bread and butter of Pennsylvania's casinos, has declined for two straight years. This fiscal year may make it three in a row. Meanwhile, in nearby Atlantic City, four of the city's 12 casinos have shuttered this year and a fifth, Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, says it will close next month.
The Cordish Cos. owns and operates the Maryland Live! Casino in Hanover, Maryland, while Greenwood operates Parx Casino and Racing, just north of Philadelphia in Bensalem.

Lawmakers discuss Illinois  school funding... 
KERRY LESTER | November 18, 2014 07:35 PM EST | Associated Press
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Parents and teachers frustrated with Illinois' school funding formula rallied for action Tuesday at the state Capitol, as House lawmakers opened talks on a bill that aims to even out disparities between districts by pumping more state dollars into poorer ones and giving less to the wealthiest.
Republicans largely oppose the bill, while Democrats who control both chambers of the Legislature mostly support it. The legislation passed the state Senate six months ago, and top House Democrats say they hope to call the bill for a vote before GOP Gov.-elect Bruce Rauner is sworn in Jan. 12.
Hundreds traveled to Springfield to join in chants and cheers before packing a committee room Tuesday. The hearing lasted several hours, only pausing when the Capitol was cleared for a fire alarm.
"There is no reason where a child lives should determine the education they receive," state Rep. Will Davis, an education appropriations chair, said. "This bill has moved the debate so much further than it's ever been before."
The proposal is considered the most serious school funding overhaul for the state since 1997. But Republicans say they need more time to fully vet it.
"I don't trust anyone at this time of year," Republican state Rep. Ron Sandack said.
The proposal, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Andy Manar, would require schools to demonstrate need before receiving almost any state money. Wealthier districts that rely largely on property tax revenues to fund their schools would receive less state aid, while property-poor districts would receive more.
Backers argue that poorer districts have less money to spend per pupil and can't increase their own districts' funding by raising property tax rates without risking those communities' economic well-being.
"We can't go to the taxpayer anymore," Pana Superintendent David Lett told the House panel. "We are taxing at an extremely high rate. We just don't have the assessed valuation, that's the problem."
Opponents say the bill unfairly penalizes people who live in areas where they pay higher property taxes in part for better schools.
"McHenry and Lake (County) have some of the highest tax rates in the state," GOP state Rep. Barb Wheeler said. "In our middle-class communities, we're going to have to cut programs."
State Board of Education officials said Tuesday that they're supportive of the concept of the proposal but would like to see a number of tweaks — including the determination of a local district's wealth.
Other elements Davis has said may be changed include a component of the bill that would eliminate a state reimbursement to districts to help offset the costs of special education staff and fixing the formula to prevent state funding cuts to "anomaly districts" that have many poor students but relatively high property tax rates.
"We'll be working with you on a consensus," Democratic State Rep. Linda Chapa LaVia, a House sponsor of the legislation, told attendees.

Mass murderer Charles Manson gets marriage licenseVan Gaal blasts 'disgusting, disrespectful' transfer talk
LONDON (Reuters) - Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has described reports that he is set to spend up to 200 million pounds ($312 million) in the transfer market as "disgusting" and "disrespectful". United spent around 150 million pounds in the close season on players, including British record signing Angel Di Maria from Real Madrid, in an effort to rebound from a poor campaign when they failed to qualify for this season's Champions League. According to British media reports, the …
Rooney and Van Persie may heap more misery on Southampton
By Sam Holden LONDON (Reuters) - Southampton will be hoping Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal does not pair Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie together in attack for Monday night's Premier League fixture at St Mary's. Van Gaal said on Friday that Rooney would return from the knee injury that ruled him out of Wednesday's 2-1 home win over Stoke City. The United captain and Dutchman Van Persie have enjoyed a lot of success against Southampton in the past and may team up again, although Van …
Forget points, just play, Koeman says ahead of United visit
By Ossian Shine SOUTHAMPTON, England (Reuters) - Beyond personal scores to be settled or Premier League points to be won, Ronald Koeman simply wants his Southampton players to produce the sizzling football he knows they have within them when Manchester United come visiting on Monday night. But the Dutch bulwark also knows a win is just what his team needs to draw a line under a blip which is threatening to mushroom into something capable of derailing what has been a breathtaking start to the …
Van Gaal rekindles spirit as United dare to dream again
By Ed Osmond LONDON (Reuters) - Four wins a row have lifted Manchester United into the Premier League's top four and Louis van Gaal's managerial reign is beginning to bear fruit after a difficult start. Although home victories over Crystal Palace, Hull City and Stoke City would not normally set pulses racing at Old Trafford, the gutsy win at Arsenal showed signs of the fierce team spirit that underpinned Alex Ferguson's glittering reign at the club. ... …

CORCORAN, Calif. (AP) — Mass murderer Charles Manson plans to marry a 26-year-old woman who left her Midwestern home and spent the past nine years trying to help exonerate him.
Afton Elaine Burton, the raven-haired bride-to-be, said she loves the man convicted in the notorious murders of seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate.
No date has been set, but a wedding coordinator has been assigned by the prison to handle the nuptials, and the couple has until early February to get married before they would have to reapply.
The Kings County marriage license, viewed Monday by The Associated Press, was issued Nov. 7 for the 80-year-old Manson and Burton, who lives in Corcoran — the site of the prison — and maintains several websites advocating his innocence.
Burton, who goes by the name "Star," told the AP that she and Manson will be married next month.
"Y'all can know that it's true," she said. "It's going to happen."
"I love him," she added. "I'm with him. There's all kinds of things."
However, as a life prisoner with no parole date, Manson is not entitled to family visits, a euphemism for conjugal visits.
So why would Burton marry him under those conditions?
She said she is interested in working on his case, and marrying him would allow her to get information not available to nonrelatives.
"There's certain things next of kin can do," she said without elaborating.
Tate's sister, Debra, who acts as a spokeswoman for the families of Manson's victims, said the impending marriage is "ludicrous."
"I think it's insane," she said. "What would any young woman in her right mind want with an 80-year-old man?"
As for Manson's motives, she said, "The devil is alive and well."
Burton gave an interview a year ago to Rolling Stone magazine in which she said she and Manson were planning to marry. But Manson, who became notorious in 1969 as the leader of a roving "family" of young killers, was less certain about tying the knot.
"That's a bunch of garbage," Manson said in the December 2013 interview. "That's trash. We're playing that for public consumption."
Asked Monday about those comments, Burton said, "None of that's true," adding that they're waiting for the prison to complete their paperwork.
California Department of Corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton confirmed to the AP that the license had been transmitted to the prison.
Thornton said each California prison designates an employee to be a marriage coordinator who processes paperwork for an inmate's request to be wed. In most cases, she said, the Department of Corrections approves of such weddings as "a tool of family reunification and social development." But Manson is a unique case.
Burton said the wedding might have happened earlier if Manson did not have "some situations" at the prison.
Thornton explained that in February, Manson had three violations for possession of a weapon, threatening staff and refusal to provide a urine sample. Further details on the violations were not immediately available.
Burton said the prison holds marriages on the first Saturday of each month and she expects to be married in an inmate visiting room at the prison.
Thornton confirmed that Manson can have a wedding at the prison and invite an officiant from outside the prison to perform the ceremony.
Manson and his prospective spouse also would be allowed to invite 10 guests who are not inmates.
He and two followers, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, remain imprisoned. Another follower, Susan Atkins, died of cancer behind bars. Other members of the Manson "family" still behind bars are Charles "Tex" Watson, Bruce Davis and Robert Beausoleil.
Manson, Watson and the women were convicted in the gruesome killings of Tate, the wife of director Roman Polanski, and four others at her estate on Aug. 9, 1969, and grocers Leno and Rosemary LaBianca who were killed the following night.
Manson is not eligible for parole until 2027. He has been a habitual criminal and spent most of his life in prison.

This short list is not final; the Modi government is scouting for more names before it takes a decision.
Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan, a Union Cabinet Minister and a well-known banker in infrastructure finance have figured so far in discussions on possible candidates for BRICS’ New Development Bank president. This short list is not final; the Modi government is scouting for more names before it takes a decision on the nomination, a Finance Ministry source told The Hindu.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his opening statement at the BRICS leaders’ meet in Brisbane on Saturday, proposed that 2016 be set as the target for the inauguration of the BRICS Bank. “We hope to ratify the agreement by the end of the year… We would soon nominate our candidate for the post of the presidency,” Mr. Modi said. The BRICS nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — had agreed at their sixth Summit in Fortaleza that India will nominate the first president of the bank and that its headquarters will be located in China.
The Modi government has not formally reached out to Mr. Rajan as yet, the source said. He also indicated that ultimately it might become difficult for India to spare Mr. Rajan for the role.
Volatility in the rupee has reduced and external account stabilised over the first 14 months of Mr. Rajan’s tenure at the Reserve Bank.

IT recruiting slows down but new sectors are hiringIT recruiting slows down but new sectors are hiring

Job hunt: A boy sells employment forms for jobs on a street.
E-commerce, aviation and hospitality are set to be the new job creators
BL Research Bureau:  
The job scene is changing. Even as IT and other traditional people-intensive sectors such as gems and jewellery have been cutting down on hiring, emerging areas such as e-commerce and aviation are taking on people.
Data from the Labour Bureau in the Ministry of Labour & Employment show that hiring across eight people-intensive sectors has been falling for the last three years. Leading these sectors is the IT sector, which accounts for a fourth of organised private sector jobs.
In 2013-14, job additions by these eight sectors, at 276,000, was 70 per cent lower than the 978,000 jobs they added in 2010-11. These numbers include full-time as well as contractual employees. The IT sector led in the pruning of new jobs, adding only 77,000 workers in 2013-14 compared with 120,000 hires the previous year and 670,000 three years ago.
This reduction in hiring is a result of companies trying to rein in employee costs, which were outpacing revenue growth.
A recent Crisil report has predicted that the declining trend in hiring will continue. With IT vendors expected to move up the value chain and also optimise on costs, the focus will now be on hiring those with domain-specific skills as also on just-in-time hiring against mass recruitment of freshers.
Trimming the workforce
Sectors such as metals and gems and jewellery have also been shrinking their workforce. The metals sector, which added 88,000 people in 2010-11, pruned about 46,000 jobs over the course of 2013-14.
The gems and jewellery sector cut about 3,000 jobs during the last fiscal year, against increases in previous years.
With the Government clamping down on gold imports last year, jewellers have been forced to scale down operations. The jewellery sector employs many artisans on contract to make customised jewellery. With gold availability affected, jewellers chose not to use the services of such contract workers, explains Ketan Shroff, Director, Penta Gold, a bullion jewellery, e-commerce and OTC firm.
According to Pankaj Parekh, Vice-Chairman, Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, apart from the erratic gold availability, the increase in the number of organised workshops with higher levels of mechanisation also had an impact.
Looking up
But the textile and leather sectors went on a hiring spree in 2013-14. The textiles sector, which is the second largest employer after agriculture, added 190,000 jobs, contributing to about 70 per cent of all new hiring. The leather sector added 39,000 jobs in 2013-14, a three-fold increase from the year-ago period.
Textile manufacturers posted a 26 per cent increase in exports last year. “There has been renewed buoyancy in the textile industry over the past few months. Problems encountered by India’s competitors such as Cambodia (due to labour unrest) and Bangladesh (safety concerns after a major factory fire) also led to some orders being diverted to India,” says Arun Singh, Senior Economist with Dun & Bradstreet India.
However, manpower consulting firms point out that even as traditional sectors are not adding too many jobs, new employment opportunities are springing up elsewhere.
Sectors such as hospitality, e-commerce and civil aviation offer good potential for employment growth, says Rituparna Chakraborty, Co-Founder and Senior Vice-President of TeamLease Services.
Improved sentiment
An Employment Outlook Report by TeamLease Services points to a positive employment sentiment in the next six months, based on booming new-age sectors such as e-commerce, and a recovery in export markets.
But if these opportunities are to translate into actual hiring, it is essential that engineers, graduates and others entering the workforce acquire the skills necessary to match the demands of the new-age sectors.

Rupee ends at 1-mth low of 61.74 against dollarForex Update: Rupee drops for 4th day against dollar, ends at 1-month low of 61.74

The rupee on Tuesday weakened for the fourth straight session and ended at a one-month low of 61.74 against the US dollar.
In line with lacklustre trade in local equities, the rupee closed one paisa down against the greenback on alternate bouts of buying and selling, despite a sharp fall in dollar overseas. In four straight days, the rupee has depreciated by 23 paise or 0.37 per cent.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the local unit resumed lower at 61.79 a dollar from previous close of 61.73. It declined further to a low of 61.8750 on initial dollar demand from importers.
Later, it met with strong resistance and recovered to a high of 61.69 before settling at 61.74, showing a fall of one paisa or 0.02 per cent. This was its weakest close since 61.83 on October 16, 2014.
"The rupee remained range bound as initially private oil firms had bought dollars that weakened the rupee to its lowest level in a little over a month," said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India.
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex on Tuesday eased by 14.59 points, or 0.05 per cent after touching its all-time intra-day peak. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $ 122.68 million yesterday, as per Sebi data.
The dollar index, a gauge of six major global rivals, was down by 0.47 per cent.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group, said: "Rupee continues to trade in a thin range. The trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.20 to 62.00."

Sensex  Nifty close in red after record highMarket Update: Sensex, Nifty close in red after record high

Emergence of profit-booking on Tuesday snapped a two-session upmove as benchmark Sensex, after logging lifetime high of 28,282.85, dipped by nearly 15 points to end at 28,163.29 as investors were seen taking a breather after the record-breaking run.
Fall in key counters including HDFC, TCS, Infosys, Sun Pharma , ONGC, Tata Motors, Hindalco and HUL mainly weighed on the market sentiment.
However, HDFC Bank, L&T, Sesa Sterlite, Bharti Airtel , Tata Steel and BHEL cushioned the fall.
The 30-share BSE Sensex resumed better and touched new intra-trade peak of 28,282.85 but fell back to end at 28,163.29, a fall of 14.59 points or 0.05 per cent.
In last two sessions, Sensex had risen by 237.24 points or 0.85 per cent and closed at back-to-back new peaks.
Profit booking at current levels and mixed expectations about probable curbs on gold import kept the stocks markets volatile throughout the day, said Hiren Dhakan, Associate Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio.
The broad-based 50-issue CNX Nifty of the NSE also eased by 4.85 points, or 0.06 per cent, to end at 8,425.90. Intra-day, it registered all time intra-day high of 8,454.50.
While sustained inflows continue to drive investor sentiment as FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth Rs 656.37 crore on Monday, traders said there is sense of fatigue setting in.
Lack of cues from the domestic and global front kept the participants on the sidelines and triggered profit taking in selective pivots, said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities.
Asian markets closed mixed on Tuesday. Key benchmark indices in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan closed lower while from Japan, Singapore and South Korea finished higher.
However, European stocks were trading better in late morning deals. The CAC was up by 0.41 per cent, the DAX by 0.74 per cent and the FTSE by 0.34 per cent.

Facebook is working on a new enterprise friendly version of its service, similar to LinkedIn, that would allow users to keep their personal profile separate from their professional account.
The service called “Facebook at Work” will allow employees to have work-friendly chats, connect with business partners, document collaboration and increase storage facilities.
The new website will look like Facebook with news feeds, but offer work and personal pages, according to ‘ zdnet.com ’ which quoted a report in the Financial Times.
The enterprise-friendly website will see the social networking site compete directly with Google, Microsoft and LinkedIn, the report said.
A work friendly version could convince enterprises to unblock the social networking website, it said.
However, it is not known when the professional version will launch.

Who is Sant Rampal From careless engineer to a man of spiritEYE BROWSE
Who is Sant Rampal? From ‘careless’ engineer to a man of spirit
Rampal was arrested on charges of murder and attempt to murder and his ashram at Karontha attached by the government.
By Manjeet Sehgal | Mail Today –  Mon 17 Nov, 2014

CHANDIGARH: This is the story of how a government engineer became a spiritual guru with thousands in thrall of him.
Speaking of modest beginnings, Sant Rampal’s is about as humble as it comes. The ‘godman’ was born Rampal Dass to a family of farmers in Sonepat district’s Thanana village on September 8, 1951.
After school, he got a diploma in engineering and joined Haryana government’s irrigation and public health department as a junior engineer.
At the age of 48, in May 2000, he was reportedly removed from the department for carelessness. By then, however, his life had already begun to change direction.
A seer, Swami Ramdevanand, had taken him under his wing 18 years before.
In 1999, Rampal established the Satlok Ashram in Rohtak district’s Karontha village.
Before long, the ashram gained popularity and Rampal Dass began to court the title of ‘Sant’. He subsequently set up several ashrams across the state, including the one at Barwala, presenting himself as an incarnation of the 15th century mystic poet Kabir. His band of followers hit new heights.
But the smooth run ended soon after. By 2000, he had run afoul of several Arya Samajis after he allegedly made derogatory remarks against the group’s founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati. In 2006, the differences between the two groups culminated in a clash that resulted in the death of one person. This is where Rampal’s tryst with the judiciary begins.
Following the clash, Rampal was arrested on charges of murder and attempt to murder and his ashram at Karontha attached by the government.
He was released on bail two years later, on April 30, 2008, after which he shifted base to Hisar district’s Barwala town.
In November 2010, the Punjab and Haryana High Court directed the Rohtak administration to hand the ashram back to Rampal.
It was after the matter moved to the Supreme Court that the ashram was handed over to Rampal again on April 7, 2013.
A month later, on May 12, clashes again erupted between a group of Arya Samajis and Rampal’s followers.
Two people were killed and around 100 injured as the police opened fire and lathicharged the warring groups to control the melee.
In July this year, Rampal and his followers went on the rampage in a Hisar court where he was to appear for a murder conspiracy trial dating back to 2006.
Since his release in 2010, Rampal, who faces contempt of court, murder and attempt to murder cases in various courts, has skipped hearings 42 times, which is why he now faces contempt charges.
An arrest warrant was issued when he failed to heed court summons last week, and this is where the current standoff began.
Sant Rampal, now revered by thousands, was born Rampal Dass to a family of farmers in Sonepat district’s Thanana village on September 8, 1951.

Bhuvneshwar KumarBhuvneshwar scored 263 runs and took 22 wickets in seven Tests during the qualification period between October 2013 and September 2014. He was one of the bright spots for India during an otherwise disappointing Test series in England, scoring 247 runs with the bat and taking 19 wickets at 26.63. His unbeaten 63 helped the side draw the first Test at Trent Bridge and during the Lord's Test, that India won, Bhuvneshwar contributed with a six-for in the first innings and a crucial half-century in India's second innings. In 22 ODIs during the same period, he took 17 wickets.
Vengsarkar, one of India's batting greats, is best known for being the first batsman to score three centuries against England at Lord's. He became the second player, after Sunil Gavaskar, to play 100 Tests for India and was also a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning team. Over a career spanning 16 years, Vengsarkar scored 6868 runs in 116 Tests and 3508 runs in 129 ODIs. He also led the side in 10 Tests between 1987 and 1989. Vengsarkar will receive Rs 25 lakh as part of the award, while Bhuvneshwar will be awarded Rs 5 lakh.
Jammu & Kashmir allrounder Parvez Rasool was named the best allrounder in the 2013-14 Ranji Trophy - he scored 663 runs and took 27 wickets in nine games - while Vinay Kumar , who captained Karnataka to a domestic treble last season won the best allrounder in domestic limited-overs competitions. Kedar Jadhav - 1223 runs - and Rishi Dhawan - 49 wickets - were awarded for finishing as the leading run-scorer and wicket-taker respectively in Ranji Trophy 2013-14.
Eighteen-year-old India Women's batsman Smriti Mandhana, who scored an important half-century during the side's Test win against England Women in August, was named best woman cricketer.

A vote shy on Keystone: Landrieus final indignityBy Aaron Blake November 18 Follow @aaronblakewp
Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., acknowledges supporters at her election night headquarters in New Orleans, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2014. Landrieu is in a runoff with Republican Senate candidate, Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La. (AP Photo/Bill Haber)
Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) has participated in a keg stand . She has run this desperate ad . She lost an energy committee chairmanship that she often touted, when the GOP took the Senate on Nov. 4. She has clashed -- in front of reporters -- with a leader of her party . That same party basically abandoned her in her runoff campaign for a fourth term.
But on Tuesday, she suffered the biggest indignity of her 2014 campaign, and possibly of her political career.
Landrieu, reduced to a relatively pointless gambit to demonstrate her clout in Washington, failed to secure the 60 votes required to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. She came up one vote shy .
This was basically Landrieu's final play. With no party funding for her campaign, she has been drubbed on the airwaves -- as in, exponentially so. And even before that, few gave her much hope in her runoff with Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.).
So in a last-ditch effort to move the needle, she launched the Keystone campaign. Nevermind that the very same bill will probably pass with ease once Republicans take control of the Senate in January. She wanted to prove she could make it happen two months earlier -- because why not.
And Senate Democrats -- who, again, have abandoned her financially -- have now abandoned her in spirit too. The vote wasn't just meaningless because Republicans will pass the bill come next year; it was also meaningless because the White House has basically said it would veto the bill, as the State Department is still reviewing the project.
And despite all of it -- despite the whole dog-and-pony show of the past week -- Democrats couldn't even give Landrieu enough votes to breathe a little life (hypothetically, at least) into her long-shot campaign.
Bloomberg declared last week that Democrats had left " a body on the campaign trail ."
On Tuesday, with Landrieu's assistance, they metaphorically ran over the body with a truck.
And Landrieu, a three-term senator and member of a royal political family from Louisiana, just proved precisely how little clout -- or hope -- she has.
In a tight vote, the Senate rejected the Keystone XL pipeline Tuesday evening, dealing a serious blow to the re-election efforts of Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.). (AP)

Spotted: Family leaves for Arpita s weddingCelebrity
Arpita and Aayush return to Mumbai
The wedding was an extremely lavish one, the wedding reception of Arpita Khan and Aayush Sharma is yet to be seen. However, the couple Arpita- Aayush were recently spotted at the Mumbai airport.

6-Year-Old Says He s World s Youngest Certified Microsoft ProfessionalA 6-year-old boy in the U.K. is claiming the title of the youngest Microsoft Certified Professional in the world .
Ayan Qureshi, who lives with his family in Coventry, U.K., passed the tech giant's test when he was just 5 years old , the BBC reported. His father, Asim Qureshi, told The Huffington Post via email that he introduced his son to computers he was 3.
"He started playing with computer bits and pieces and was made familiar with many features of the Windows operating system," Asim Qureshi said. "It became a hobby for him."
After realizing that his son had a serious knack for computers, Asim Qureshi started helping him study for the Microsoft Certified Professional exam, he said. The test "validates IT professional and developer technical expertise through rigorous, industry-proven, and industry-recognized exams," according to Microsoft's website .
"In the beginning it wasn't easy at all," Asim Qureshi said. "It took many months to prepare for the exam. For this purpose, Ayan studied Microsoft books and set up a home computer lab to do the preparation for the certification."
But the months of preparation paid off: Ayan is now a certified IT professional. He told BBC News that the exam was “difficult but enjoyable.”
He also has some impressive future plans. BBC News reported that he wants to launch E-Valley in the U.K. one day, which will be very similar to Silicon Valley.

Govt targets free trade pact with AustraliaMatt Siegel and Jane Wardell     Canberra/Sydney   Last Updated: November 18, 2014  | 13:22 IST

India and Australia will push for a free trade pact between their countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Tuesday, during a rare state visit to Canberra by an Indian leader.
Australia on Monday finalised a landmark free trade deal with China more than ten years in the making, significantly expanding ties between the world's second largest economy and one of Washington's closest allies in Asia.
Trade between Australia and India stands at around $15 billion a year, or just a tenth of that between Australia and China.
"We want to go further and that's why the next priority for Australia is a comprehensive economic partnership agreement with India," Abbott said.
"If I may say so, this is a moment in time. This is the time to get this done."
Modi, who will address the Australian parliament later on Tuesday, emphasised the need to secure greater access for Indian investors.
"We have agreed to speed up negotiations on the comprehensive economic partnership agreement," Modi said. "I also asked for easier access for Indian business to the Australian market and quicker investment approvals."
"We also agreed on seeking early closure on the civil nuclear agreement, which will give Australia a chance to participate in one of the most secure and safe nuclear energy programme in the world."
Australia sealed a civil nuclear deal to sell uranium to the country in September and also offered to increase supplies of conventional fuel to help it overcome chronic shortages.
Talks towards the Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement began about two years ago after Australia lifted a long-standing ban on selling uranium to energy-starved India.
Modi last night addressed thousands of expatriate Indians at a packed 21,000 seat arena in Sydney that just last week hosted the rolling stones, underscoring the rock star status he enjoys among some Indians at home and abroad.
Modi, who arrived on Friday for the G20 economic summit in Australia, where about 300,000 Indians live, urged Indians to boost investment at home.
Australia is emerging as a key source of thermal coal for country's growing number of electricity users.
Country's trade and infrastructure conglomerate Adani Enterprises has signed a pact for a loan of up to $1 billion from the State Bank of India (SBI) for a $6 billion Australian coal mine, rail and port project.

Safety agency to push for national air bag recall...Regulators Demand Takata Airbag Recall Be Nationwide

DETROIT (AP) — The federal government is demanding that the auto industry recall millions of additional cars equipped with faulty air bags that can injure — and even kill — a driver.
The action Tuesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers driver's side air bags equipped with inflators made by Takata Corp. of Japan. The inflators can erupt and send metal fragments into the passenger compartment.
Previously, cars with the inflators had been recalled only in regions with high humidity such as Gulf Coast states, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Takata has said that prolonged exposure to moisture can cause the air bag propellant to burn faster than designed, causing the problem.
Up until now, about 8 million cars in the U.S. with Takata inflators have been recalled for problems with either the driver or passenger side air bag, or both. Another 4 million have been recalled outside the U.S. At least five deaths worldwide have been linked to the problem.
Safety regulators say Tuesday's action is based on incidents involving a death in California and an injury in North Carolina where the air bags were implicated. Both states are outside of the area covered by the earlier recalls.
"One can be an anomaly. Two becomes a trend, and we feel we need to act," said NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman.
Takata said in a statement that it agrees the current recall should be expanded if the investigation it's conducting with NHTSA determines there is a safety risk. But it said the current results indicate that a regional recall is appropriate. Takata said it has evaluated 1,000 driver and passenger inflators from outside the humid areas and none have ruptured.
"Takata is concerned that a national recall under these circumstances could potentially divert replacement air bags from where they're needed, putting lives at risk," the company said.
Lawmakers have pressured the government to expand the recall to all 50 states as reports of deaths and injuries emerged. While they'll partly get their wish, the expanded recall won't cover passenger air bags, at least not yet.
Also, car owners may run into a problem: a limited number of replacement parts. Takata is struggling to make enough replacement air bag inflators to handle the smaller regional recalls and likely will have trouble supplying demand for a nationwide recall. The company has promised to add two production lines by the start of next year to make more inflators, Friedman said on a conference call following the government's recall statement.
Friedman said that if Takata and the automakers don't agree to the recall quickly, the safety agency will use its legal powers to make sure the inflators are recalled. He also said Takata resisted moving to a nationwide recall Monday evening.
Takata didn't respond to that charge in its statement, but the company said it "remains committed to addressing all safety issues promptly."
On Thursday, lawmakers will hold a hearing to question Friedman, as well as representatives from Takata and the automakers, about their response to the air bag problem. And next week, millions of drivers across the U.S. will hop in their cars to travel for the busy Thanksgiving weekend.
The government's demand for the national recall covers vehicles made by Ford, Honda, Chrysler, Mazda and BMW, generally from the 2008 model year and earlier. The owner of a 2007 Ford Mustang recently complained to the government about suffering a leg injury when an air bag malfunctioned in North Carolina.
Friedman said NHTSA is asking automakers for a complete list of vehicles with Takata inflators that are similar to the 2007 Mustang, and that information will be shared with the public when available. He did not know an exact number of vehicles involved.
Ford, Chrysler, Mazda and Honda said Tuesday that they're working with NHTSA, but they wouldn't say if they will expand their recalls. BMW said its recalls of Takata air bags already are national.
On Monday, The Associated Press reported that Honda was quietly fixing air bags across the nation if customers were concerned about their safety. So far, Honda has formally issued recalls in 13 states and territories.
For now, NHTSA isn't demanding a national recall of Takata's passenger side air bags, which have different inflators. The agency says it has been pushing the auto industry to do tests to make sure regional recalls cover all defective air bags. Friedman said that, so far, there have been no reports of passenger air bags rupturing outside the high-humidity areas.
However, the agency will require the automakers to set the same boundaries for regional recalls of passenger air bags.
Currently, some are recalling cars in Florida, Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, while others have larger zones. The agency wants all the recalls to cover those four areas, plus counties near the Gulf Coast in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, as well as Guam, Saipan and American Samoa.

India is experiencing urbanisation at a rapid pace: PMIndia is experiencing urbanisation at a rapid pace: PM
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | November 18, 2014 16:10 IST
Studies suggest that by 2031 11% of the world's urban population might be in Indian cities, says PM.
 
 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the speech at the reception hosted by the Prime Minister of Australia.
Prime Minister Tony Abbott, 
All the eminent people gathered here and 
Our great cricketers, 
This has been/ an extraordinary visit to Australia. 
You hosted a great G20 Summit. It showcased Australia's global role. 
In the past four days, I have experienced everything that Australia is known for natural beauty, sunshine, great cities, friendly and cheerful people, organisational skills and strengths that have made you an economic force in the world. 
Prime Minister, you have been truly generous with your hospitality and warmth. 
I am deeply honoured that you have come to Melbourne to host such a wonderful reception. 
This memory will stay with me forever; 
But, I can tell you that all Indians are deeply touched by this Reception. 
Many Indians wake up early on a cold December morning to watch on TV a Boxing Day Test at this magnificent stadium! I know that India has not done particularly well in this ground! But, we won the 1985 Champions Trophy here. And, Gavaskar and Kapil Dev are here! 
As is Laxman, who especially loved to bat against Australia. To speak to you at this historic ground comes close to scoring a century here especially against McGrath and Brett Lee. I met him yesterday. The best I managed was to head the Gujarat Cricket Association. 
This would be a deserving venue for the Cricket World Cup finals 2015. I hope that our two teams will play that match. 
No business is serious enough to keep an Australian and an Indian / from discussing this great game.
We can learn from Australia's famous sporting skills in other areas, too.
And we have decided to collaborate on a Sports University in India.
What we also see is the importance of relationships between people.
It is said that Melbourne is the best city in the world to live in.
Sydney might not agree!
India can learn from Australian experience and benefit from your expertise. 
India is experiencing urbanisation at a rapid pace. Studies suggest that by 2031 11% of the world's urban population might be in Indian cities. 
We already have over 50 cities which have a population of more than 1 million. 
Urbanisation can be an enormous opportunity. 
In India, we have yet to build much of our urban infrastructure for the future. 
Our plans include 100 smart cities; revival of heritage cities; building modern solid waste management and waste water treatment systems in 500 cities; and, cleaning up our rivers. 
This is part of our larger vision of a sustainable future for our country, and transforming the quality of life of our people. In cities and villages alike. 
I want to build a future, when every Indian, can say, yes, my life has improved and my environment has become better. 
I am confident that we will achieve it with the support of the people of India, and through the talent and energy of 800 million youth, below the age of 35 A generation that is eager for change and committed to work for it. 
A successful India will be a vast opportunity and a force of good for the world. 
We look forward to closer partnership / with friends like Australia. 
Prime Minister Abbott and I have spent a good part of this week together in two countries and four cities.
I have also met the political leadership, business leaders and the vibrant Indian community. 
We have achieved a lot in the last few days. 
One thing we all agree on. The bonds between the countries are made strong by joined hands of our people. 
So, our exchanges in sports, tourism, education and culture are great source of strength for our relationship.
As I see the warmth and friendship for India today and over the last five days. I feel great confidence in the future of our relationship. 
My memorable visit to Australia // ends tonight, but a new journey of our relationship has begun. 
Thank you / and hope you are all coming to India soon!

Sun Pharma recalls 68 194 bottles of anti-depression drug in USHigh Court directive to DLF to demolish some portions of complex
Drug major Sun Pharma is voluntarily recalling 68,194 bottles of its Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release tablets, used to treat major depressive disorder, in the US market.
As per the information available on the USFDA website, Sun Pharma Global Inc, a unit of the company, is recalling the drug for failing “dissolution specification”.
The 37.5 mg tablets in 30-count bottles and 90-count bottles, were manufactured by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries at Halol for Sun Pharma Global Inc, Dubai, it added.
The recall was initiated on September 26 this year.
It has been classified as a ‘Class-II recall’ which FDA defined as “a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote”.
A spokesperson of Sun Pharma declined to comment.
Shares of Sun Pharma closed at Rs 882.45 apiece on the BSE, down 0.46 per cent from previous close.

N Srinivasan not involved in cricket match fixing activity  Mudgal Committee to SCHigh Court directive to DLF to demolish some portions of complex
In findings that could leave IPL teams Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals vulnerable, the Justice Mudgal Committee has indicted their officials Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra of betting and confirmed their role in their teams but cleared N Srinivasan of match fixing and scuttling the probe.
The three-member Committee, in its report to the Supreme Court, however, indicted the BCCI President-in-exile for not taking action against a cricketer, who it did not name, for violating Players Code of Conduct despite being aware of it.
It confirmed Meiyappan was a team official (team principal) of CSK while RR’s owner Kundra’s “infractions violated BCCI/IPL Anti Corruption Code”.
A provision in the IPL code of conduct says that any team official found guilty of “bringing the game into disrepute” by betting or match-fixing, their team could be scrapped.
The Committee, headed by retired High Court Chief Justice Mukul Mudgal with Additional Solicitor General L Nageshwar Rao and senior advocate Nilay Dutta as members, held that Srinivasan’s son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan was involved in betting but not in match fixing.
It also questioned why Rajasthan police stopped probe abruptly on Kundra for his betting activities after the case was transferred from Delhi police.
Further, the Committee found that IPL CEO Sunder Raman knew of a contact of a bookie and had contacted him eight times in one season.
“This individual (Sunder Raman) admitted knowing the contact of the bookies but, however, claimed to be unaware of his connection with betting activities.
“This individual also accepted that he had received information about individual 1 (Meiyappan) and individual 11 (Kundra) taking part in betting activities but was informed by the ICC-ACSU chief that this was not actionable information. Thgis individual also accepted that this information was not conveyed to any other individual,” the Committee said.
While giving its findings on Srinivasan, the panel said “This individual is not involved with match fixing activity. This individual was not found to be involved in scuttling the investigations into match fixing.”
“This individual (Srinivasan) along with four other BCCI officials was aware of the violation of the Players Code of Conduct by individual 3, but no action was taken against individual 3 by any of the aforesaid officials who were aware of this infraction,” the report, which was supplied to the parties today, said.
The findings on Meiyappan said, “No material is available on record to show that this individual is involved in match fixing.”
“Thus the Committee is of the view that due to the scientific evidence of voice matching and the testimony of security personnel recorded by the investigating team, the finding about the betting activities of individual 1 (Meiyappan) and the finding that he was a team official stand confirmed,” it said.
The report said investigations have confirmed that Meiyappan was a team official of a franchiseee and he was in close touch with individual 2 with whom he had frequently meetings in his hotel room.
The report, supplied to different parties in the case, only revealed the name of Meiyappan, Kundra, Raman and Srinivasan. Names of other persons including cricketers were not disclosed as the per the apex court order.
N Srinivasan worships in Kerala temple
On a day of relief for him in the match fixing issue, BCCI President in exile N Srinivasan today worshipped at the famous Rajarajaeswara Temple at Taliparamba in Kannur district in Kerala.
Srinivasan who arrived at the temple in the morning offered the ‘ponninkudam’, a major offering to the presiding diety Lord Siva.
According to temple officials, Srinivasan who was accompanied by some senior officials of India Cements, spent about 30 minutes in the ancient temple.
Famous personalities who have visited the temple in the past include former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and BJP leader and former Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa.

DoT plans 2-stage bid  prices to hit the roof'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
Bids in the February 2015 spectrum auction are likely to skyrocket as the department of telecommunications (DoT) plans to auction just 800/900/1800 MHz spectrum bands, and not the vital 2100 MHz band spectrum that telcos were hoping for. Auctions for spectrum in the 2100 MHz band will take place only in May, and with no certainty about how much 2100 MHz spectrum would be available in the May auction, telcos will have no option but to bid very aggressively to retain their 900 MHz spectrum in February.
It is unclear if the bidding parameters will change after telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s meeting with defence minister Manohar Parrikar on Monday, but it is significant that Prasad’s ministry has been in talks for swapping spectrum with the defence ministry in the 2100 MHz band, vital for data services, and a substitute for telcos whose 900 MHz spectrum licences expire next year — auctions for these will be held in February 2015.
While the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has recommended postponing the spectrum auction if there isn’t enough spectrum in all bands — it has also recommended a defence-DoT spectrum swap to free up 15 MHz in the 2100 MHz spectrum band — this was rejected by the Telecom Commission on November 7.
Trai will reply to the Telecom Commission next fortnight, but Trai chairman Rahul Khullar has given media interviews reiterating his stance that not auctioning all spectrum together will prove disastrous for the industry, subscribers as well as the government. This stand of Trai’s has also been endorsed by the country’s top four mobile operators in a joint letter to Prasad and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Five days after the Telecom Commission rejected Trai’s recommendation, in a presentation to Prasad on November 12, DoT talked of a two-stage bid and merely mentioned that talks with the defence ministry to release 15 MHz of 2100 MHz frequency spectrum through a swap was under way along with the release of 5 MHz in 17 circles.
That it was hopeful of only the latter materialising was evident when it said “it has also been proposed to add Rs 5,000 crore as receipt for Auction of 5 MHz block in 2100 MHz band, subject to vacation of the same by Defence”.
The crux of the problem is that while in February 2014 roughly 90% of the spectrum auctioned was brand new, things will be the exact opposite in the February 2015 auction when just 10-15% of the spectrum will be new. A good example of what this will do in Maharashtra, to take one example, is that Vodafone could well see its business shut down in the state. Right now, Vodafone has 6.2 MHz of spectrum in the 900 MHz frequency band where its licence is running out later this year. If it is not able to win this back in the auction, its only fallback is 1800 MHz spectrum. But it has only 1.25 MHz of this spectrum and only another 2 MHz is available for auction. So Vodafone will bid whatever it takes for it to retain the 900 MHz spectrum, but it requires just one other telco to take the price higher and higher. Such examples can be multiplied manifold across various other telcos as well as licence circles.
According to DoT officials, the reason for holding a two-stage auction rather than go by Trai’s recommendation to hold it at one go, even if it means delaying the entire process, is because the government wants to balance its budget while taking into account the interests of the operators. While spectrum is available in 800, 1800 and 900 MHz, DoT is in talks with the defence ministry for vacation of 3G spectrum in the 2100 MHz band.
There are two components of its negotiations with the defence. The first relates to getting vacated 5 MHz spectrum in each of the 17 circles and the second is a swap proposal — take from defence 15 MHz in the 2100 MHz band and in lieu of it give it an equal amount in the 1900 MHz band. The resolution of this would take time — according to DoT’s timeline, this should be done by the end of December 2014. In such a scenario, holding auctions at one go in February would not be possible and deferring the entire process to the next fiscal would mean foregoing the receipts estimated in this year’s Budget.

Israel vowed harsh retaliation Tuesday for a Palestinian attack that killed five people and left blood-smeared prayer books and shawls on the floor of a synagogue in Jerusalem – an assault that sharply escalated already-high tensions after weeks of religious violence.
The attack during morning prayers in the west Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof was carried out by two Palestinian cousins wielding meat cleavers, knives and a handgun. They were shot to death by police after the deadliest assault in the holy city since 2008.
Four of the dead were rabbis and one was a police officer who died of his wounds hours after the attack. Three of the rabbis were born in the United States and the fourth was born in England, although all held dual Israeli citizenship. Five others were wounded.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack, the first time he has done so in the wave of deadly violence against Israelis. But he also called for an end to Israeli “provocations” surrounding Jerusalem’s shrines that are sacred to both Muslims and Jews.
President Barack Obama called the attack “horrific” and without justification, urging cooperation from both sides to ease tensions and adding that too many Israelis and Palestinians have died in recent months,
Tuesday’s attack, however, appeared to mark a turning point, with the gruesome scene in a house of worship shocking a nation long accustomed to violence.
The government released a photo of a meat cleaver it said came from the crime scene. Government video showed blood-soaked prayer books and prayer shawls in the synagogue. A pair of glasses lay under a table, and thick streaks of blood smeared the floor.
“I saw people lying on the floor, blood everywhere,” said Yosef Posternak, who was at the synagogue in the quiet neighborhood that has a large community of English-speaking immigrants.
“People were trying to fight with (the attackers) but they didn’t have much of a chance,” Posternak told Israel Radio.
In one of Israel’s first acts of retaliation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the demolitions of the homes of the attackers. But halting further violence could prove to be a tough challenge as police confront a new threat: Lightly armed assailants from annexed east Jerusalem who hold residency rights that allow them to move freely throughout the country.
Netanyahu condemned the deaths of the “innocent and pure Jews.” In a nationally televised address, he accused Abbas of inciting the recent violence and said the Palestinian leader’s condemnation of the attack was insufficient.
Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs the Gaza Strip, praised the attack. In Gaza, dozens celebrated in the streets, with some offering trays full of candy.
The U.S.-born victims were identified as Moshe Twersky, 59, Aryeh Kupinsky, 43, and Kalman Levine, 55. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the British man was Avraham Goldberg, 68, who immigrated to Israel continued…

Senate blocks NSA phone records measure... 
KEN DILANIAN | November 18, 2014 08:35 PM EST | Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Tuesday blocked a bill to end bulk collection of American phone records by the National Security Agency, dealing a blow to President Barack Obama's primary proposal to rein in domestic surveillance.
The 58-42 vote was two short of the 60 needed to proceed with debate. Voting was largely along party lines, with most Democrats supporting the bill and most Republicans voting against it. The Republican-controlled House had previously passed its own NSA bill.
The legislation would have ended the NSA's collection of domestic calling records, instead requiring the agency to obtain a court order each time it wanted to analyze the records in terrorism cases, and query records held by the telephone companies. In many cases the companies store the records for 18 months.
The revelation that the spying agency had been collecting and storing domestic phone records since shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was among the most significant by Edward Snowden, a former agency network administrator who turned over secret NSA documents to journalists. The agency collects only so-called metadata — numbers called, not names — and not the content of conversations. But the specter of the intelligence agency holding domestic calling records was deeply disquieting to many Americans.
The bill had drawn support from technology companies and civil liberties activists. Its failure means there has been little in the way of policy changes as a result of Snowden's disclosures.
Pressured to act, Obama in January proposed curbing the NSA's authority and the House in May passed a bill to do so.  While the measure was pending, the NSA continued to collect American landline calling records, though the program does not cover most mobile phone records.
The law authorizing the bulk collection, a provision of the post-9/11 USA Patriot Act, will expire at the end of 2015. That means Congress would have to pass legislation re-authorizing the program for it to continue.
For that reason, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, abandoned her previous opposition to the bill. "If we do not pass the bill, we will lose this program," Feinstein said on the Senate floor.
"This bill increases trust and confidence and credibility of our intelligence system," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.
But Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, called the bill "totally flawed" and said the NSA needs the ability to sift through domestic calling records and hold them records. "We have under surveillance any number of Americans who are committed to jihad," Chambliss said.
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the bill "gutted" a program that could successfully unravel domestic terror plots. If there is another terror attack on U.S. soil, he said, "I promise you the first question we will be asked is why didn't we know about it and why didn't we prevent it."
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had earlier said he would oppose the measure, called the USA Freedom Act, because it would "hinder the ability of intelligence community analysts to query a database to determine links between potential terrorists."
McConnell pointed out that the bill includes no requirement that the telephone companies continue to hold the data.
One of the few Republicans to support the measure was Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who said, "This legislation protects the constitutional right to privacy."
The NSA collects domestic landline calling "metadata" showing numbers called and times of calls, but not names or the content of conversations.
Current and former intelligence officials disagree about whether the phone record searching is a crucial counterterrorism tool. The U.S. has only been able to point to a single case that came to light exclusively through a search of domestic phone records— an Anaheim, California, cab driver who was sentenced earlier this year to six years in prison for sending money to Somalia's al-Qaida affiliate.
As it stands, officials have said, the program is not gathering most cell phone billing records, which account for an increasing share of domestic phone calls. Under both the House and the Senate bills, the NSA would have been able to query those records, provided the agency can work through the technical hurdles.
Laura W. Murphy, director of the ACLU's Washington Legislative Office, expressed disappointment in the Senate's action.
"Allowing NSA surveillance to continue unchecked does real harm to Americans," she said in a statement. "Constant surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment, chills free speech, imperils freedom of the press, and is an affront to the Constitution. Tonight the Senate voted to maintain a status quo that undermines American technology and consumer privacy and hampers innovation. Though this vote is a setback, it will not stop the push for reform."

Employees of Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Limited (FACT) re-launched their protest action after a gap of more than four months demanding the revival of the company. They organised a day-long dharna and protest march to the corporate office of the public sector company on Tuesday.
It was on June 27 that the employees, under the aegis of Save FACT Action Committee, withdrew their 249-day-old protest action, including a relay hunger strike, after Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers Ananth Kumar promised to speed up approval of a revival package for the company.
Former chairman and managing director of FACT George Sleeba inaugurated the dharna by the protesting employees at Udyogamandal. P.M. Sharafudeen, president of FACT Officers’ Association, presided at the inauguration of the dharna. Former MPs K.P. Dhanapalan and K. Chandran Pillai; BJP district general secretary N.P. Shankarankutty and AITUC district president K. Vijayan Pillai also spoke.
Employees of the company plan to hold protest action in the State capital in the second week of December besides continuing protests in the coming days in Kochi.
The FACT delegation is also slated to take part in the hearing scheduled by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) in New Delhi on November 20.

How to look like in your 20s when in your 30sHow to look like in your 20s when in your 30s — a dermatologist’s guide
By Dr Kiran Lohia | TheHealthSite.com –  Fri 14 Nov, 2014 9:44 PM IST

Turning 30 is a big milestone in both, a man and woman’s life. However, as the years pass by, people especially women get anxious to look good and prevent the signs of ageing. Here are some useful tips to help keep you looking as young as you did in your 20s!
Change your skincare routine
The most important thing to maintain young skin is following a routine that ensures that the moisture is intact in your skin. The more hydrated your epidermis, the more youthful your skin will be.
First of all, look for gentle cleansers that are without foam. Foaming washes typically have sulfates that dry out the skin, making it less nourished and more wrinkled. Look for cream cleansers such as ‘Avederm Soothing Facial Cleanser’ or ‘Cetaphil Cleanser’ that gently get rid of dirt while moisturising your skin. Know how to moisturise your skin naturally , here.
Second, get rid of your toner. Toners dry out your skin, making it less supple. Instead use a hydrating serum that contains actives like Hyaluronic Acid or Vitamin C for nourishment with vitamins to prevent oxidative damage. Here are some chemical ingredients in your beauty products that can ruin your skin. 
Finally, make sure you moisturise your skin. Use gentle moisturisers that ensure proper hydration and make sure you do so at least twice daily!
Protect your skin from the sun
The sun is the number one cause of ageing. Both UVA and UVB rays contribute to a plethora of skin issues including sun spots, freckles, rosacea, skin laxity, pigmentation, sagging and wrinkles. Wear sunscreen with broadband protection with at least SPF30 and PA++, and make sure you apply a large amount or it won’t work! Also, apply it 30 minutes before you leave the house and do reapply every 4 hours. Here is how you can help your skin heal faster from sunburn with these DIY tips. 
Exercise
Regular exercise is a great way to prevent ageing. In fact, regular exercise has been proven to reduce skin ageing by up to 20%. Make sure you exercise at least 30 minutes a day for 6 days a week to get the most of its anti-ageing benefits.
Natural beauty care
At home, for a natural youthful boost, you can try a hydrating mask. Combine avocado and rosewater and apply on the face. Leave it on for 30 minutes until it dries, and then wash it off. This wonderful therapy delivers essential fatty acids, Vitamin E, Vitamin A, antioxidants and other nutrients for a time-reversing skin boost. You could also use mango or papaya instead of avocado. Make sure you do this once a week for the optimal results. Read here about more face packs with rosewater. 
At the dermatologist’s
As a dermatologist, I know that there are a multitude of treatments that can help boost collagen, ensuring your skin stays young. Lasers such as ‘Clearlift’ can boost skin strengthening proteins while treating marks, closing pores and gently tightening skin without side-effects. In case you are averse to lasers, gentle glycol peels can be used for a glow along with providing a slight increase in collagen production. I usually prescribe topical creams that help reduce the physical signs of ageing. These creams also leave a gentle glow on your face. Say goodbye to 4 common skincare problems with these tips.

Let`s be honest with ourselves & get out of self denial. We are not counted among the big boys. But should it effect any of the economic powers & it will, we will surely feel the ripple effect. Ideally, it`s best to brace ourselves against any or all eventualities.

When this stock was correcting from around  444 level and went down to 360 levels --- at that time also I was knowing that this will recover and go past 444.Because technical charts were clearly showing all the probable levels .I posted the charts with analysis in fb group.And because of that I have not sold any of my AFL stock in panic...I posted about that here also.

PEBS Pennar aims to touch Rs 550 cr in FY15Story
Engineered to Succeed
It is just four years old but PEBS Pennar has grown rapidly and is now planning to expand further riding on its strength in niche areas.

CATEGORY: Excellence in Corporate Governance
At a time when growth is talked about in past tense, there are some exceptions too. While growth in infrastructure and construction sectors over the past few years has slowed down, the Hyderabad-based maker of pre-engineered steel buildings, Pennar Engineered Building Systems (PEBS Pennar), seems to have made rapid strides. The company designs, manufactures, supplies and installs pre-engineered steel buildings and building components for industries, warehouses and commercial centres among others.
PEBS Pennar, part of the Rs 1,225-crore Pennar Group, was incorporated in 2008 and became operational in January 2010. It posted revenue of Rs 34 crore in the first three months of operations. In the full year, it earned Rs 165 crore. In 2013/14, it closed at Rs 417 crore and aims to touch Rs 550 crore in the current fiscal year. "We have seen a 40 per cent compounded annual growth rate and we are also a zero-debt company," says Aditya Rao, Vice Chairman. Son of Nrupendra Rao, a first-generation entrepreneur who forayed into cold-rolled steel making in the late 1980s and is now also the Vice Chairman of industry body CII's Telangana Chapter, Aditya attributes this feat to the company's focus on putting in place good engineering and execution teams.
Both the father and the son give full credit to Managing Director P.V. Rao for the company's growth. Rao is a civil engineer with 22 years of experience and joined the Pennar Group in 2008 from Tata BlueScope where he was chief operating officer. Manish Sabharwal, Chairman of staffing company TeamLease , and a board member of PEBS Pennar, says the company has evolved to become a truly board-managed firm where there is a professional chief executive who sets targets and is held accountable to that. "It is validated by the private equity investment that they have managed to attract," he says. Private equity firm Zephyr Peacock last year invested Rs 50 crore to take a 26 per cent stake in PEBS, valuing the company at about Rs 200 crore. Zephyr now has two representatives on the board of PEBS.
Rao says the market size of pre-engineered buildings (PEBs) in India is Rs 4,500 crore. "We have 10 per cent market share and five years on we want to touch 25 per cent. Today, we have a plant in Hyderabad. We want to set up another one in north India, preferably in Gujarat or Rajasthan, to address the northern and western markets," he says. The company aims to touch Rs 1,000 crore in revenues in the next three years.
Aditya says the growth strategy is three-fold. "What we are already doing, we will do in different geographies. For instance, move beyond south to enter north India and even abroad, say Africa. We will also try to do new things using our core assets of engineering and designing capabilities, robust manufacturing and project management capabilities. We just don't do PEBs. We see ourselves at once as a PEB company, a structural steel company, a cold form buildings company, a solar module mounting structures company and an engineering services company," he says.
The company has already entered into making structural steel towers for Reliance Jio Infocomm . "We are one of the major suppliers and have done business worth Rs 300 crore in the last 18 months," says Rao.
The company is also focussing on corporate governance. "It is important in terms of how we look at our processes. For instance, we do constant appraisal of our internal audit procedures and how technology can be used to improve it," says Aditya.
C. Parthasarathy, Chairman of financial service provider Karvy Group and who is on the PEBS Pennar board, says the company is very conscious about corporate governance and is constantly taking every feedback seriously.
To put in place an advisory board by the end of 2014/15 is yet another objective. "There are some industry leaders and thought leaders whom we hope to rope in. We also want to go beyond what the company law stipulates. For instance, have more than one woman director and build on a structure where the independent directors are more in number than the executive directors, to a degree where there is a transparent board," says Aditya.
Talking about the company's progress, Sabharwal, who knows Pennar and its founder since 1990 when he worked as an executive assistant to Nrupendra Rao, quotes Mario Cuomo, ex-governor of New York, "We campaign in poetry and govern in prose." "I think PEBS Pennar has got the right balance in poetry and prose," he says.

Senco plans to open jewellery stores chainStory
Making a cautious bet

CATEGORY: Outstanding Capital Management (Large Companies)
On the 10th floor of Diamond Prestige, a commercial building in South Kolkata's busy AJC Bose Road, business is thriving. The floor houses the headquarters of Senco Gold, the gold jewellery retailer focused on eastern India that is drawing up ambitious plans to go national. "We are the largest gold jewellery retail chain in eastern India and are now aiming to have a pan-India presence by the end of 2016," says Sankar Sen, Chairman and Managing Director.
Senco's journey started in 1938 when Sen's grandfather, MC Sen, opened a jewellery shop in Kolkata's Bow Bazar, a shopping hub for gold jewellery in the city. The company, however, was incorporated in 1994. Today, it makes 500,000 jewellery pieces and consumes about 1,500 kg of raw gold every year. It reported a profit of Rs 36.49 crore on revenue of Rs 1,311 crore in 2013/14.
In its attempt to become a pan-India player, the family-controlled jewellery retailer has stepped out of its traditional stronghold and is now present in the Delhi, Odisha, Jharkhand, Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar markets with a network of 60 showrooms. Of these, 32 are franchisee outlets. It is looking to add another 40 stores in the next three years. The franchisee model also helps Senco's finances. The company has about Rs 120 crore cash from franchisees and leverages the money to buy gold that is part of its inventory but is owned by the franchisees. Senco has increased its sales without becoming asset heavy through this model. Now, 40 per cent of its top line comes from franchisee.
To fuel the company's expansion, Sen brought on board leading venture capital fund SAIF Partners, which invested Rs 80 crore in the company in October. Vishal Sood, Managing Director at SAIF Partners, says that Senco has created a high-quality brand, has posted robust growth over the years and has a wide network in eastern India. The Rs 80 crore, however, will not be sufficient to fund Senco's expansion plans and the company is looking to raise capital through an initial public offering. The IPO is likely by the end of 2016-17, says Sen.
Sen says jewellery retailers need to maintain a large inventory at any point of time. But that requires huge capital investment. "The investment is definitely higher in the jewellery retail business, unlike wholesale and export where it is order-based," he says. So, how does he manage money in the capital-intensive business?
Senco's annual working capital requirement was Rs 300 crore last year and is estimated at Rs 500 crore this year due to addition of about 15 stores. It meets this requirement by taking on loans from a consortium of six banks, led by Allahabad Bank. It also takes on short-term loans from banks in the form of gold at six per cent. Senco's auditor and financial advisor KPMG helps it in capital management and suggests relying more on gold loans, which also have a hedging mechanism. All sales happen in cash and proceeds immediately reflect in the company's books. "We buy raw gold, silver and platinum in cash. Since prices are volatile, neither the buyer nor the seller is willing to take a position," says Sen, adding that he does not speculate on gold prices. "You have to be careful not to burn fingers in speculation," he says.

Govt urges higher pay for millions of Gulf workersStory
Govt urges higher pay for millions of Gulf workers

Government is pressing rich countries in the Gulf to raise the wages of millions of Indian citizens working there, in a drive that could secure it billions of dollars in fresh income but risks pricing some of its citizens out of the market.
Over 5 million Indian nationals are believed to be employed in the oil exporting states of the Gulf , the single largest group in a migrant worker population of more than 20 million.
Migrants do many of the dirty and dangerous jobs in the region, from construction to the oil industry, transport and services. They account for nearly half of the roughly 50 million population of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council  (GCC).
So India's campaign for much higher pay could have an impact on economies around the region, especially if it leads to a general increase in wages for workers from other big labour-supplying countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Over the past seven months, Indian diplomats in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have sharply increased the minimum salaries that they recommend for Indian workers at private and public firms in those states.
"We want the Indian workforce to be paid higher salaries. Inflation, the value of the Indian currency and a rise in the cost of living in the Gulf were the factors that led to the decision," YS Kataria, a spokesman for the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA) in New Delhi, told Reuters.
The success of country's strategy is not yet clear, however. Officials in at least some GCC nations have expressed displeasure, and the strategy could backfire if those countries end up hiring more workers from elsewhere in the world.
"Of course it will encourage companies to look at Bangladesh and Pakistan as more viable options to get migrant workers," said Mohammed Jindran, managing director of UAE-based recruitment agency Overseas Labour Supply.
PRESSURE
The Government cannot dictate the pay of its citizens in the Gulf - decisions to hire workers are made by labour recruiters in individual countries, which have not set minimum wages for migrants and usually prohibit union activity by them.
However, the recruiters must rely on the co-operation of local authorities to operate in the country. An internal memorandum prepared by the MOIA, sent last month and seen by Reuters, says that if workers are offered wages below specified minimums, ministry officials "would deny emigration clearance".
In Saudi Arabia, the Indian embassy lifted the recommended minimum salary posted on its website to 1,200 riyals ($320) a month earlier this year from 670 riyals. In the UAE, the minimum wage for Indian blue-collar workers rose to 1,500 dirhams ($409) in recent weeks from 1,200 dirhams last year, Jindran said.
Even when Gulf recruiters agree to certain wage levels, the numbers do not necessarily stick. Some workers are promised one salary when they sign up in their home country, then forced to renegotiate lower wages when they arrive in the Gulf.
Country's role as a top labour supplier means its drive cannot be totally ignored by recruiters, and it could have a big impact in some countries and industries. But there may be a backlash.
Another MOIA official said India's pay demands had met initial resistance in all six GCC countries , while two of the countries had threatened to reduce their Indian workforces and hire more, lower-paid workers from Bangladesh and Nepal instead.
Ahmed Al-Fahaid, Saudi deputy labour minister for international affairs, told Sky News Arabia last month:
"If this is a decision that is applied throughout India as a whole, meaning no one gets out of India for work unless with that limit, then this is a sovereign decision for the country and we will not interfere," Fahaid said.
"But if it is a special decision to raise wages for whoever comes to work in the kingdom, then we oppose it and do not accept it, as it would be an act of discrimination and we don't accept that in international agreements." He did not elaborate.
IMPACT
If India's efforts to secure higher pay succeed, they could boost its economy, because migrants send much of their pay home. India received $69 billion as remittances in 2012; a 2010 central bank study found Gulf nations accounted for 31 per cent.
Higher wages could also impact many companies. Fawwaz al-Khodari, chief executive of Saudi builder Abdullah Abdul Mohsin al-Khodari 1330.SE, said profits in the sector might be squeezed by demands from governments of some labour-exporting countries.
"In cases where salaries have been 800 to 900 riyals, we are now hearing talk of 1,500 riyals as a minimum salary, which is a huge increase. Clearly this would become a major issue in the contracting industry."

BMW develops street lights with electric car-charging socketstechnology (general)
BMW has developed street lights equipped with sockets to charge electric cars, it said on Friday, and will run a pilot project in Munich next year that uses existing local authority lighting networks.
BMW said it has made two prototype "Light and Charge" street lights which combine efficient Light Emitting Diodes (LED) with the company's ChargeNow recharging stations for electric cars.
"Seamless charging infrastructure is essential if we want to see more electric vehicles on the road in our cities in the future," Peter Schwarzenbauer, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, said.
The Munich pilot will install the first charging lights, which can be grafted straight onto the existing local authority street lighting infrastructure, BMW said.
These additional charging stations can be used by as many drivers as possible, regardless of vehicle model and electricity provider, BMW said.
Two street lights are already installed in front of the BMW headquarters. Drivers will be able to pay to charge their cars via a mobile phone app.
BMW has developed some of the most advanced electric cars, including the i3 city vehicle and i8 hybrid. But electric cars as a product category have struggled to gain widespread popularity due to their limited operating range, the scarcity of charging stations and the time it takes to recharge them.
BMW and other car makers are increasingly expanding their know-how of electric cars and related technology that could broaden their appeal.
In addition to developing street lighting, BMW has already invested into software and applications that help drivers of electric cars find a parking space and charging stations, including investments into Justpark.com and the SLAM charging network.
BMW executives recently met with rival Tesla Motors to discuss the availability of electric vehicle charging stations.
In September, Daimler said it had bought mytaxi and RideScout, two smartphone applications that will help the maker of Mercedes-Benz limousines provide services to people who do not own cars.

Rate cut by RBI will give good fillip to economy: JaitleyUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
TOPICS
economy (general)
More measures to tackle infrastructure sector challenges are in the pipeline, says the Finance Minister.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that since inflation has moderated, “if RBI [Reserve Bank of India], which is a highly professional organisation, in its wisdom decides to bring down the cost of capital [it] will give a good fillip to the Indian economy.”
The Finance Minister was delivering the key note address at the Citi’s Investor Summit: ‘India – Poised for Higher Growth’. Also present were Finance Ministry officers and RBI Deputy Governor S.S. Mundra.
Mr. Jaitley said though the disinvestment targets for the current financial year were quite ambitious, he hoped to achieve them or at least come close to achieving them. He also said road shows for the planned disinvestments were under way in many parts of the world.
Later, Mr. Mundra told reporters that the recent cooling of retail inflation was a combined outcome of factors, including a favourable statistical effect of a high base last year, a downturn in global commodity prices and easing of vegetable prices. Official data released earlier this month showed retail inflation too had slowed in October to 5.5 per cent, against 6.5 per cent the previous month
The Finance Minister has on several occasions called for lower interest rates.
Domestic and international investors attended the summit.
Mr. Jaitley said the government had taken a series of measures for tackling infrastructure sector challenges and that many more measures were in the offing. He said he was in discussion with the Opposition members to make the necessary procedural changes in the Land Acquisition Act to avoid delays in the implementation of infrastructure projects. He also said that the government through its Budget had laid down a direction in which the economy is likely to proceed to restore investors’ confidence and assured them that there would not be any movement in the contrary direction.
Giving details of various economic reforms in the pipeline, he said he was expecting the Insurance Amendment Bill to be passed in the Winter Session of Parliament for which he was in touch with the Parliament Select Committee.
On the Goods and Service Tax (GST), the Finance Minister said he was in touch with various State governments for ironing out outstanding differences. He said States want to retain taxation authority for liquor and petroleum products. They also want entry tax and octroi to be kept out of the purview of the GST. The Finance Minster said that all these issues will be sorted out soon.
He will also apprise the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers about the draft Constitution Amendment Bill on GST before introducing it in Parliament.

The Senate is about to vote on Keystone XL. Does the pipeline still matterBy Steven Mufson November 18 Follow @StevenMufson

On Sept. 19, 2008,  newspaper headlines screamed  about the massive federal bailout plan to stem the widening financial crisis. Investors were fleeing to the safety of Treasury bonds, while Hurricane  Ike was bearing down  on the Gulf of Mexico, causing oil companies to shut down 90 percent of offshore wells and 10 onshore refineries.
In the middle of this chaos, here’s an item that did not make headlines: TransCanada filed an application with the State Department to build a nearly 1,700-mile, $7.6 billion Keystone XL pipeline.
More than six years later — an eternity in the life of the economy — TransCanada is still waiting to find out the fate of the Keystone XL. On Tuesday, the Senate is expected to vote on a bill approving construction of the pipeline. It's still not clear which way the Senate will go since the vote is too close to call. Even if the Senate does approve the measure, President Obama is expected to veto it since the administration's review of the pipeline isn't finished yet.
While it’s been waiting for a verdict on Keystone XL, the energy industry has undergone a huge transformation. Thanks to shale oil drilling,  U.S. domestic oil production  has jumped by almost 4 million barrels a day. The  number of rail cars carrying petroleum  went from an insignificant number to more than 16,000 a month. And the number of  miles of pipelines  carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products increased by 5,090 (through 2012) to 151,912 miles.
Given all that change, does the Keystone XL still matter?
From a business point of view, TransCanada says it does. TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard says Keystone XL’s original customers signed 18 to 20 years of binding contracts to transport oil sands crude from Alberta to Texas. The customers still see the pipeline with a capacity of 830,000 barrels a day as safer and cheaper than rail alternatives, and the modernized, upgraded refineries on the gulf coast as the place best capable of processing the thick low-quality oil from the oil sands.
“No one has walked away and we even have a waiting list,” Howard said in an e-mail. “These are the people who will pay for the cost of the pipeline through tolls and fees – and they have a lot ultimately invested and committed and they have a strong sense of the need and the demand in the market.”
Although U.S. crude oil production has soared with the shale oil drilling boom, the United States is still  a big net oil importer  — averaging more than 9 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Canada is the largest source of U.S. oil imports, and could supply more.
The first thing to know about the Keystone pipeline? It already exists. Here's a breakdown of the pipeline's various parts. (Gillian Brockell, Jhaan Elker and Kate M. Tobey/The Washington Post)
Valero, the nation’s biggest refiner, said in  an investor presentation  at a UBS oil and gas conference in late May that western Canadian crude oil from oil sands were selling at more than $15 a barrel discounts from similar quality crude from Mexico because transportation bottlenecks are forcing Canadian oil sands producers to pay high fees to railroads, which now carry more than a million barrels a day of crude, gasoline and diesel fuel.
President Obama suggested in comments last week that Canadian crude oil would be exported after getting to the gulf coast. TransCanada and refiners say that’s not the case. The Canadian oil sands crude would go into the mix of raw material. The vast majority of the refined products would stay in the United States, but a substantial minority would be exported.
Yet the Keystone XL permit has become much more than a simple business proposition and more than a long piece of steel equal to just 1 percent to the nation’s existing web of oil pipelines. It has also become a powerful symbol.
That’s been the work of climate activists — led in large part by Middlebury College professor Bill McKibben and reinforced by some of Obama’s biggest backers — who say that from a climate point of view the pipeline still matters. They have taken aim at Canada’s oil sands, or tar sands, as particularly bad for the climate. That’s because extracting oil from the sands not only means clearing swaths of boreal forest, it also requires large amounts of energy; the sands must be heated either after strip mining or through underground steam injection, adding about 17 percent to emissions.
The argument against the Keystone XL pipeline is that by providing relatively inexpensive transportation, the pipeline will facilitate more oil sands development. And oil companies — to the dismay of climate activists — have been planning large increases in output from Alberta’s oil sands.
Earlier this year, Statoil and Total shelved oil sands projects. But just last week, the Canadian company Cenovus said it received a permit from Alberta to expand its output by about 50 percent. And the  Alberta Energy Regulator  forecasts an increase in overall oil sands output from about 2 million barrels a day currently to about 4.4 million barrels a day by 2023.
Whether stopping the pipeline would actually stop the production projects remains a central issue. Supporters of the project say that if the pipeline is rejected, Canada will build pipelines to the east or west and send its crude elsewhere. But there is tremendous domestic Canadian opposition to those pipelines too, and they would not lead directly to modernized refineries like those on the gulf coast. They would need to be transported again by tanker.
If oil sands output were curtailed, the loss of oil supply could lead to higher global prices, but it’s hard to calculate how much higher. At the moment, there is adequate supplies and oil prices have dropped about 25 percent in recent weeks.
Members of the House of Representatives voted in favor of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline on Friday. The Senate could vote next week. (AP)
The State Department’s final environmental impact statement said that stopping the Keystone XL pipeline would not alter greenhouse gas emissions because oil sands producers would find other ways to ship the oil, such as railroads. It was a backhanded sort of statement of approval; since the pipeline would not needed (and make no difference from an environmental point of view), it could go ahead.
But the State Department report also noted that if oil prices dipped below $75 a barrel — the current level — some companies might reconsider expansion projects.
Ironically, one place where the pipeline makes little difference is in Louisiana. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) are behind the respective Senate and House bills that attempt to compel the administration to issue a permit to TransCanada. The bill sponsored by Cassidy passed the House on Friday.
Yet Louisiana has no direct connection and few indirect ones. The pipeline does not run through any part of the state. Louisiana did not provide any of the  steel pipe , one of the biggest chunks of spending for the project.
Indeed, in 2012 TransCanada — with Obama’s support — split the project in half, creating a southern leg that did not cross international borders and therefore only needed Army Corps of Engineer approval. It obtained the permits and completed the 485-mile segment — redubbed the Gulf Coast Pipeline. It has been carrying oil from Cushing, Okla., a major supply depot and reference point for the benchmark West Texas Intermediate grade of crude oil, to Nederland, Texas on the edge of Port Arthur.
What still hangs in the balance is the northern segment, which would run 1,170 miles from Hardisty, east of Edmonton, through Montana and South Dakota and end up at Steele City, Neb., where it would connect to an existing section completed as part of an earlier pipeline project, the first Keystone line. TransCanada’s spokesman Howard said that the cost for that remaining segment has ballooned from $5.4 billion to about $8 billion, though part of that has been spent already to stockpile pipe and other equipment. Other parts of that total will be spent buying goods in other countries.
So why do so many lawmakers care? Two reasons. One, the pipeline has become popular; the vast majority of Americans support construction of the project. Two, it has become a symbol of devotion to energy security, jobs and the oil and gas industry. That’s nothing new for Landrieu, who has lambasted Obama for the moratorium on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the BP oil spill; demanded a greater share of royalties from federal waters to states on the gulf coast; and pressed for faster approval of liquefied natural gas export terminals, among other things.
Lawmakers also say they care because of the jobs the Keystone XL project would create. Citing the State Department final environmental impact statement, the lawmakers say the project would create 42,000 jobs.
But it takes the economy less than a week to create that many permanent jobs. What’s more, these pipeline jobs wouldn’t be permanent.  The State Department report  uses the notion of “job years.” So the project, which is expected to take two years to build, requires 3,900 job years for the construction workforce, or 1,950 jobs that last over a two-year period. Another 26,000 jobs (or 13,000 over twoyears) would go to suppliers of goods and services.
Once the project is completed, operations would require 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors, the State Department report says.
The union movement is divided over the project. Construction unions back it. But others — such as transport workers or nurses — oppose it.
Bob Keefe, executive director of Environmental Entrepreneurs, which promotes renewable energy projects, said “any way you measure, jobs from Keystone is minuscule and a false debate.”
And, he might have added, it’s also been a long debate. After six years, it’s still not over.

Investing: Rake in more cash0
Preferreds have features of both stocks and bonds. Like stocks, preferreds give you an equity stake in a company. Their dividends qualify for the long-term capital-gains tax rate, which means they face a maximum tax rate of 23.8 percent. Like bonds, preferreds distribute a fixed amount of income and get repaid at par value when redeemed, normally at $25 per share. But preferreds rank behind bonds in the pecking order of who gets paid first if a company goes bust.
The catch is that preferreds either have no fixed maturity date or come due far in the future. So preferreds tend to perform like bonds, their share prices moving up and down with changes in long-term interest rates. Companies have the option to "call," or pay off, a preferred after a set period -- usually five years from the date of issue. Because issuers are less likely to call preferreds when rates rise, a preferred's duration (a measure of interest-rate sensitivity) grows and losses mount. "To invest in preferreds today, you have to be comfortable with a little volatility," says Jay Wong, comanager of Payden Equity Income Fund.
Thanks to a drop in long-term rates, preferreds are on a roll. So far in 2014, Standard & Poor's U.S. Preferred Stock index has returned 11.6 percent. And although yields have fallen as prices have risen, preferreds still outshine most income securities. The S&P Preferred Stock index yields 6.5 percent, nearly triple the yield of 10-year Treasury bonds.
As tempting as those yields look, don't put more than 10 percent of your fixed-income assets into preferreds. In addition to the risk of rising rates, you face sector risk because most preferreds are issued by financial institutions. Also, companies can cut or suspend preferred dividends without notice.
Start your search by focusing on solid companies with preferreds trading for $25 per share or less. One good choice is Goldman Sachs Series I (symbolGS-PI). It pays a dividend of $1.49 per share per year and, at just over $24, it yields 6.2 percent. The issue can be called in November 2017. BB&T Corp. Series D (BBT-PD) pays $1.46 and yields 6.0 percent, also at a price just over $24. The issue is callable in May 2017.
For a diversified approach, go with an exchange-traded fund. The best bet is iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). The fund, which charges 0.47 percent per year in fees, returned 11.2 percent in the first nine months of 2014 and yields 5.8 percent.

This Is What Everybody Really Does In The Office Bathroomreddit
What happens in the work bathroom stays in the work bathroom. That is, until a Swedish hygiene company decides to ask nearly 14,000 workers in 13 countries what the heck it is they do in there.
Turns out workers across the globe do a whole range of things in the office bathroom, according to the survey by Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget, which commonly goes by SCA . They laugh, they cry, they even exercise.
One of the survey's biggest takeaways is that Americans have it pretty good. U.S. workers ranked most likely to be satisfied with the bathroom situation at work. To be precise, 87 percent of workers said they were satisfied with their work bathrooms, which is more than any other nation surveyed. Thirteen percent of Americans went as far as to say they prefer their work bathrooms to their home bathrooms.
But it's not all roses. A quarter of U.S. workers said they don't like using the bathroom at work at all. So what do workers do in the bathroom? Here's a handy breakdown:
81 percent just use the toilet.
We assume the other 19 percent are either holding it or live extremely close to work.
46 percent wash or freshen up.
This is especially true if your job is acting in cleanser commercials.
24 percent talk on the phone.
There's one in every office.
22 percent change clothes.
Usually happens directly after the walk of shame (or about 18 hours before it).
19 percent text message.
15 percent put on makeup.
100 percent of them as effortlessly as Anne Hathaway, of course.
15 percent take a break to be alone for a little while.
Otherwise known as "What am I doing with my life?" time.
11 percent take a break to release frustration.
Sounds like a euphemism if we've ever heard one.
10 percent have private conversations face to face.
Or shoulder to shoulder in some cases.
8 percent take a shower.
Sometimes you just don't have a choice.
7 percent take a break to cry.
What's a bathroom even worth if you can't cry in it sometimes?
7 percent smoke.
Why not just take a smoke break outside?
6 percent just keep working and sending emails.
It's where some people get their best ideas.
5 percent eat some food.
We get the appeal, but there's got to be a cleaner place to eat by yourself.
3 percent take a nap.
Napping is never a bad idea, until half of your face looks like the bathroom wall.
3 percent exercise.
Um, what?

RCEP talks: India should open up to gain from regional partnershipLower concessions mooted for China, Australia, New Zealand as they are not FTA partners
New Delhi, November 18:  
India wants to offer lower market access concessions to countries such as China, Australia and New Zealand, with which it has no bilateral free trade agreements (FTA), as part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) being negotiated.
The next round of the negotiations for RCEP — a free trade pact between India, the Asean bloc, Japan, South Korea, China, Australia and New Zealand — will be in New Delhi on December 1-5.
New Delhi is also trying to ensure that agreements on goods and services do not get hived off into separate packages but are concluded together as a comprehensive pact.
“We do not want to offer the same concessions that we give to the ten Asean countries, Japan and South Korea that are our FTA partners, to other members, especially China. We will discuss this at the New Delhi meeting,” a Commerce Ministry official told BusinessLine.
Asean includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
The problem that India faces is that as per negotiating rules, it has to give a basic minimum level of common offers to all RCEP members. “Since Indian industry is extremely cautious of China, we are finding it difficult to come up with substantial offers. It is something we have to deal with,” the official said.
The proposed RCEP will create the largest regional trading bloc in the world, involving 45 per cent of the world population with a combined gross domestic product of $21.4 trillion.
“Regional integration is extremely important and India must work towards it. RCEP is a great opportunity for us. It is India’s time to take advantage of this. If we don’t do so, we will lose being part of the regional chain,” said Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher at a seminar organised by CII and Japanese trade body JETRO on Tuesday.
Indian industry should not shy away from opening up as it could lead to development of local industry’s supply chain, said Toshiyuki Sakamoto, Deputy Director-General, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
“Thailand and Indonesia’s experiences show that opening up led them to become important parts of the supply chain of the automobile industry,” he said.
RCEP is crucial for Indian industry at a time when developed economies are negotiating mega free trade deals such as the Trade and Investment Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Partnership, Kher said.
India has implemented a number of FTAs with countries and groupings such as Japan, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Asean, but is yet to be part of a significant regional trade bloc.

Chennai, November 18:  
The Board of Control for Cricket in India decided to hold its annual general meeting on December 17 while expressing support to its erstwhile president and the present chairman of the International Cricket Council N Srinivasan.
The working committee meeting was held on Tuesday after submission of the Mudgal Committee report on the IPL betting and fixing scandal to the Supreme Court on Monday.
The Court-appointed panel cleared Srinivasan of any involvement in fixing or betting charges but found fault for ignoring a violation of the code of conduct by an unnamed player.
‘No taint’
Srinivasan, chairman of International Cricket Council, was present at the meeting as chief of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.
A statement issued by the BCCI said that “there is no taint on the conduct of Srinivasan and the allegations levelled against him by unscrupulous elements were baseless and were aimed at destabilising the working of the BCCI.”
The members also discussed the final report of the Mudgal Committee. The working committee also heard the IPL Chief Operating Officer Sundar Raman’s explanation regarding references to him in the report. The members decided that the board would support Raman to represent himself before the Supreme Court, the statement said.
The Mudgal Committee report said that Raman knew a contact of a bookie and had been in touch with him during a season. It also said that Raman had received information about Gurunath Meiyappan of Chennai Super Kings and Raj Kundra of Rajasthan Royals taking part in betting activities.
“We will wait for the Supreme Court decision. Whatever they say, we will accept. Like everybody is given an opportunity to explain himself, we have decided that Raman should be allowed to present himself in the Supreme Court,” BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel told newspersons in a brief interaction with reporters after the meeting.

Cisco unveils cloud-based app for corporatesCisco unveils cloud-based app for corporates
Rajalakshmi Nirmal
Tweet
Los Angeles, November 18:  
Cisco, the networking giant, has launched Project Squared, a business collaboration app that combines chat, audio, video, multi-party meetings, and content sharing in a single experience.
Project Squared, unveiled at the Collaboration Summit 2014, is built upon the Cisco Collaboration Cloud, a new generation platform and is the company’s answer to the challenges an organisation faces of staying connected across devices, time zones and project teams.
The app makes virtual conferencing possible. Teams can download the app (which is free for now), start a room and invite others inside or outside the organisation to join by simply entering their e-mail address. Once in the room teams can securely share messages, and start voice and video calls, with no download requirement.
The company doesn’t intend to market it as a consumer app — it doesn't, want to be the next mobile messaging app similar to WhatsApp or become a Facebook for corporates. It plans to pitch its app to corporates in order to help them improve employees’ productivity and collaborate with customers, business partners and workers. Now, if a company’s data is on the cloud, the question that rises is — how reliable is the platform.
Operating on Cisco’s cloud platform, the app provides end-to-end content encryption, offering reliable data transfer by keeping away hackers. The data get encrypted at the client’s side and thus promises privacy of documents.
Rowan Trollope, SVP, Collaboration Technology Group, Cisco, said, “we created Project Squared and the Cisco collaboration cloud platform to deliver on our dream to transform the collaboration experience, making it easy to stay constantly connected to the people, projects and ideas that matter most.”

Melbourne, Nov 18:  
Cricket diplomacy was in abundance at a rare reception given to Narendra Modi at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground with the Prime Minister saying a “new journey” in India-Australia relationship has begun.
Addressing the select gathering at the reception hosted by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and attended by cricket greats like Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Allan Border and Dean Jones among others, Modi heaped effusive praise on Australia’s sporting culture and thanked his Australian counterpart his “truly generous hospitality“.
Thank you @TonyAbbottMHR for the wonderful dinner at @MCG . Enjoyed being at this iconic ground. pic.twitter.com/JnrfOOiqtj
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 18, 2014
Modi described his speech at the 161-year-old MCG ground “close to scoring a century here especially against McGrath and Brett Lee” and said, “This memory will stay with me forever.”
“Many Indians wake up early on a cold December morning to watch on TV a Boxing Day Test at this magnificent stadium! I know that India has not done particularly well in this ground! But, we won the 1985 Champions Trophy here. And, Gavaskar and Kapil Dev are here!
“As is Laxman, who especially loved to bat against Australia. To speak to you at this historic ground comes close to scoring a century here especially against McGrath and Brett Lee. I met him yesterday. The best I managed was to head the Gujarat Cricket Association,” he said.
Talking about the MCG, Modi said it would be a deserving venue for the Cricket World Cup finals 2015 and hope that India and Australia will play that match.
“No business is serious enough to keep an Australian and an Indian from discussing this great game,” Modi said.
Before the dinner by Abbott, Modi presented “Skippers” memento carrying replica of Mahatma Gandhi’s charkha with three cricket balls signed by him and World Cup winning Indian captains Kapil Dev and M S Dhoni.
He said, “My memorable visit to Australia ends tonight, but a new journey of our relationship has begun.”
The Prime Minister also noted that people asked him that isn’t it too soon for him to visit Australia after Abbott’s recent trip to India “I said I can’t say no to my friend Tony“.
Modi also told Abbott for travelling all the way to Melbourne to attend the reception.

G20 summit fails to make substantive progress on black money'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
The G-20 summit in Australia failed to make substantial progress on financial transparency and illicit flows, an eminent international think-tank famous for its pioneering work on black money has claimed.
“The G20 passed up a golden opportunity to begin tackling this global scourge by curbing the abuse of anonymous companies and instituting public country-by-country reporting for multinational corporations,” said Raymond president Baker Global Financial Integrity (GFI).
Considered to be a longtime authority on financial crime, Baker had recently co-authored an open letter to G20 leaders on the topic prior to the summit.
“Illicit financial flows – fuelled by anonymous companies and tax haven secrecy – undercut economic growth and tax revenues, drain roughly USD 1 trillion per year from developing and emerging countries and facilitate crime and corruption on a grand scale,” Baker said.
G20 summit noticeably lacked in responses to illicit financial flows, one of the largest drags on development worldwide, a statement said.
The GFI has long advocated for basic financial transparency measures to hinder common methods of moving illicit money – specifically, public registries of company ownership information, public country-by-country reporting, and global automatic exchange of financial information.
All of these issues have enjoyed a worldwide surge of public momentum in recent years, but the G20’s statements this weekend fell short of capitalising on this movement, the statement said.
According to the GFI, the G-20 commitment to automatic exchange of tax information is welcome but incomplete.
“While this is a welcome culmination of the G20’s long track record of leadership on automatic exchange, the G20 failed to address the extension of tax information exchange to the other 100+ countries in the world,” it said.
“For a couple of years, the G20 has declared that automatic exchange of financial information is ‘the new global standard’ and now we are proudly seeing that claim come to fruition,” said GFI Policy Counsel Joshua Simmons.
“However, it’s critical that the new framework for making information exchange a reality is able to accommodate the world’s poorest countries, who suffer the effects of tax evasion and money laundering at least as much as and often substantially more than – rich countries,” he added.

Amex  PayPal funded Ezetap targets small towns  villages with mobile PoS solutionsAs State Bank too cuts deposit rates, era of cheaper loans get closer
Mobile payment solutions start up Ezetap aims to connect small towns and villages in India with businesses through its mobile Point of Sale (mPoS) services, which it says will also help in financial inclusion.
Founded in 2011, the Bangalore-based start-up counts PayPal founder Peter Thiel and credit card giant American Express among its investors.
Global banking giant Citibank has approved Ezetap’s service as the first mobile Point of Sale (mPoS) service globally, while the company is payments technology major Visa’s global preferred mPoS partner outside of the US/Europe.
Ezetap’s mobile payment platform, which turns any mobile device into a point of sale (PoS) payment terminal, provides a cost-effective alternative like micro-ATMs to reach 6,00,000 villages in India and connect them with banks, insurance companies and even online shopping sites, a top company official said.
“Access to cash is seen as a key requirement of banking and most financial inclusion initiatives have had limited success. People are rightfully paranoid with the idea that when they urgently need access to cash, they have to travel 20 km to the neighbouring town and eventually find an ATM,” Ezetap Co-founder and CEO Abhijit Bose said.
Despite, banks scaling their ATM networks, the size and scope of the problem means the rate of growth is always behind the demand, he added.
Explaining about the PoS device, Ezetap Co-founder and Chairman Sanjay Swamy said: “The solution is offered at an enticing price point of Rs 499 (as a non-refundable deposit) with a monthly fee of Rs 150 and commission of Rs 5 per cash back transaction.”
Any legitimate business can open a zero balance current account with SBI and any Android or Windows phone or Tablet with a WiFi or data connection. For any PoS transactions, the amount plus commission are settled the next day into the bank account of the merchant, he added.
“Also when people know they can go to the neighbourhood store and withdraw cash, more people will be comfortable keeping cash in the bank and over time realise they could just as easily shop and pay directly from their bank account,” Swamy said.
The firm is also a perfect example for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious ‘Make in India’ programme, he said.
“Ezetap is the only mPoS company who do their own design, hardware manufacturing, software development, integration with banks as well as customers’ back end Online transaction processing (OLTP) systems, to offer a complete solution to business problems,” Bose said.
Analysts feel that as India grapples with the issue of financial inclusion, with operating cost and user charges forming an important dimension, such technologies can provide an efficient, secure and cost-effective alternative.
Besides, the growing demand for fast and secure payments from sectors ranging from banking & insurance to eCommerce, particularly in the rural and unbanked areas, has also aided the growth of mobile payment solutions firms, analysts said.
“Our endeavour is to develop cost-effective and affordable solutions that can not only help to spread financial inclusion, but also provide avenues to other businesses like eCommerce to spread to the small towns and villages across India,” Bose said.
One such example is the deal signed with the State Bank of India, where Ezetap will provide the public sector bank 500,000 PoS devices over 5 years, he added.
Elaborating on the business, he added Ezetap is live in multiple countries across Africa and South East Asia. Its customers include leading eCommerce firms, bill payment and collections, insurance, FMCG, restaurants and hospitality, retail, taxi services among others.
“We have over 5,000 merchants which includes a mix of large enterprises and SMEs across more than 600 cities, many of which use our new cash@PoS service,” Bose said.
Meanwhile, Swamy said that eCommerce firms like Big Basket, Urban Ladder and some of the largest online retailers in India also use Ezetap devices for Card on Delivery collection.
In insurance, Bajaj Allianz is a customer, while Janalakshmi and Micropension use Ezetap’s solutions to provide financial services, he added.
“We also expanding out footprint outside India. In the next 6 months, Ezetap’s service will go live in two countries in South East Asia, one in Africa and one in the Middle East,” Bose said.
The firm is already providing services to agri-products major BIDCO in Kenya.

JSW Energy  JPVL stocks pack a punch on powerdealBSE Sensex eases further on selling in IT sector
JSW Energy reported its highest single-day gain on the BSE on Monday after the company announced purchase of two Himachal-based hydro-power plants from Jaiprakash Power Ventures for an enterprise value of R9,700 crore, nearly seven weeks after signing an MoU in this regard.
After rallying as high as 13.4% to Rs 86 intra day, the JSW Energy scrip closed at R85.05, up R9.20, or 12.1%. Jaiprakash Power Ventures (JPVL) also rallied close to 6% before ending the session at R14.76, up 2.71%. Jaiprakash Associates, the holding company of JPVL, fell 2.6% to R33.65.
While an MoU on the deal, which also included the sale of 500 MW of Bina, was signed in late September, valuation details were not available then.
Under the latest arrangement, the board of JPVL approved a transfer of its 300-MW Baspa-II and 1,091-MW Karcham Wangtoo hydro-electric projects into a separate company called Himachal Baspa Power Company. Subsequent to this, JSW Energy will acquire 100% stake of the resulting company by paying the equity consideration in cash.\
While the method through which JSW Energy plans to fund the deal was not announced as of Monday, the Street seems to have acknowledged that the acquisition will turn the company into the largest hydroelectric power producer in the country with an operating portfolio of
1,300 MW.
According to JSW Energy, the acquisition was a strategic fit to the company since it was also setting up its own 2,450-MW hydro project in the state. “This is an attractive deal for our shareholders, as it is expected to be earnings accretive on closure,” JSW Energy’s chairman Sajjan Jindal said in a press release.
However, initial reactions from analysts voiced concern on the value provided by these projects, especially if the company considers equity dilution for funding the deal.
As per Ambit Capital, the acquisition is not value-accretive as it believes that a wholly debt-funded purchase will only add 0.5% to the expected fair value of the stock (R65) while an equity dilution would bring it down 1.8% to R63.8.
The brokerage argues that although the acquisition would improve the power-purchase agreement (PPA) share in the overall portfolio, value accretion beyond the purchase price is unlikely due to peak return-on-equity ratios (RoEs) and uncertain carbon credit hand-outs. It expects the Baspa-II and Karcham plants to report RoEs of 31% and 16% in fiscal 2015-16.
Meanwhile, trading interest in JPVL stocks is likely to show an upward bias given that the deal is likely to bring a much-needed improvement in the balance sheet of the company as its management in the past has clearly said that the proceeds will be used to pay off debt.
As per Bloomberg, while the standalone net debt of JPVL stood at R17,496 crore as of September 2014, the consolidated debt of the company was R26,272 crore as of March 2014.

Yen on defensive ahead of BOJ  euro holds gains0
Sterling and the New Zealand and Australian dollars had been the main losers among major currencies early in Europe, both the Aussie and the kiwi hurt by trade numbers from China showing a sharp drop in imports and another 2 percent slide in oil prices.
Sterling and the Aussie recovered most of those losses, but the kiwi traded almost 0.9 percent lower by 0630 ET while Norway's crown - exceptionally sensitive to oil prices - dropped around half a percent against both the euro and dollar.
"With the kiwi, its more the move higher in U.S. yields than anything," said Hardman. "It's really a big story of dollar strength."
The Swiss franc, another very low yielding currency, fell to an 18-month low of 0.9818 francs per dollar.
TARGETTED
Among big events for markets this week are the European Central Bank's second offer of targeted loans (TLTRO) to banks and speeches by a handful of U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of next week's final policy meeting of the year.
"The jobs numbers supported the dollar and we expect this trend to continue ahead of the Fed meeting as interest rate expectations continue to adjust," said Josh O'Byrne, a strategist with Citi in London.
Overall, the dollar was up another 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies. Dealers said the yen was supported by around $2 billion worth of options expiries at 121.50 yen per dollar, putting a cap on the dollar's strength.
Most major banks continue to predict further gains for the dollar against its major peers in 2015, although the surge past 120 yen has left some wondering how much juice there still is in the yen trade, at least for now.
There is also Japan's national election next Sunday, currently seen as likely to give a boost to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and reflationary policies which weaken the yen.
The euro fell to a low of $1.2247 after Nowotny's comments.
"We expect the euro to continue to weaken in the week ahead," analysts from French bank BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. "Another low TLTRO uptake could put some upside pressure on euro front-end rates. However, low demand would also increase the chances of an increase in asset purchases (by the ECB) early next year."

Virginia college student Hannah Grahams death ruledhomicideA University of Virginia student whose disappearance sparked a month-long search died from "homicidal violence".
By: Associated Press | Charlottesville | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:55 am
A University of Virginia student whose disappearance sparked a month-long search died from “homicidal violence” but the exact cause is unknown, authorities said Tuesday.
The Albemarle County Police Department outlined the findings from the Virginia medical examiner’s office in the death of 18-year-old Hannah Graham but said a final autopsy report has not been issued.
The man Graham was last seen with, 32-year-old Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr, has been charged with abduction with intent to defile Graham.
In an emailed statement, county police and prosecutors said they would not be answering any further questions or providing additional information so they can “protect the integrity of the case.”
Graham’s remains were found Oct. 18 near Charlottesville, roughly 6 miles (10 kilometers) from where the body of 20-year-old Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington was found after she vanished in 2009.
Graham met friends at a restaurant for dinner on September 12 before stopping by two off-campus parties. She left the second party alone and eventually texted a friend saying she was lost, authorities said.
In surveillance video, she can be seen walking unsteadily and even running at times, past a pub and a service station and then onto a seven-block strip of bars, restaurants and shops.
Police have said forensic evidence connects Matthew to Harrington’s killing, which in turn is linked by DNA to a 2005 sexual assault in northern Virginia. Matthew has pleaded not guilty in the 2005 case.
Following the positive identification of the remains last month, Albemarle County Commonwealth’s Attorney Denise Lunsford said in a statement that the focus of the investigation now is to determine “what charges will be brought and the appropriate time to make those charges.” In Tuesday’s joint statement, county police and prosecutors said they “remain committed to the investigation.”

Parking norms all set to change  Patil gives in-principleapprovalUT Adviser K K Sharma said that the aim of changing norms was to rationalise the parking space as Chandigarh had the most liberal availability of parking space.
By: Express News Service | Chandigarh | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:53 am
 
Parking norms in Chandigarh are all set to change. Punjab Governor and UT Administrator Shivraj V Patil on Tuesday gave in-principle approval for rationalising the existing requirements for providing parking spaces in residential, commercial as well as residential buildings.
As per norms, certain percentage of the plot where construction is to take place is to be reserved for parking. This varies as per the kind of building that is constructed. The Department of Urban Planning had prepared a proposal for reducing the area under parking spaces and bring it on a par with the National Building Code norms. In Chandigarh, the parking space required to be made available was more than the prescribed norms.
It has now been decided that in the commercial area, the parking space required to be provided would be 3 equivalent car space (ECS) per 100 square metre. Earlier, it was 4 ECS per 100 square metre. In case of group housing societies, at present 1.8 ECS is to be provided per dwelling unit. This would now be 1.5 ECS per dwelling unit for 1200 sq feet area and 3 ECS per unit for 3,000 sq feet area. An additional 10 per cent space would have to be provided for guest parking.
Norms would be changed for educational institutes as well. Building plans of several schools were pending with the administration as the existing parking norms could not be fulfilled. At present, 20 per cent of the plot area and 33 ECS per acre was to be reserved for parking. This would now be only 20 per cent of the plot area. For hotels, 2 ECS per 100 sq feet parking would have to be provided. Earlier, the requirement was 4 ECS per sq feet.
UT Adviser K K Sharma said that the aim of changing norms was to rationalise the parking space as Chandigarh had the most liberal availability of parking space. The parking norms for all kinds of buildings would undergo a change. The administrator had given his in-principle approval for the same, he added.
According to an official of the administration, internationally, providing too much parking space is avoided. This discourages people from using cars. “Chandigarh has the highest per capita cars and the numbers are increasing everyday. While there would be some who would feel that with a change in norms, parking spaces would reduce. However, we would now be following NBC guidelines,” he said.

PMCs hunt for garbage space gets hit by protest afterprotestPrint
Written by Nisha Nambiar | Pune | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:46 am
A landfill site for garbage disposal seems to be eluding Pune Municipal Corporation. After the district administration handed over a list of stone quarries to the Corporation to make a choice, the civic administration zeroed in on a 25-hectare land in Moshi in the jurisdiction of Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. Even as the plan to shift disposal operations there is awaiting clearance from the state government, protests from locals — something PMC has been grappling with earlier — have taken off.
PCMC had a garbage dump at Moshi but is planning to shift it to Punawale. PMC sent a proposal to the government to locate its dump in Moshi prompting them to strongly protest.
Shiv Sena MP Shivaji Adhalrao-Patil, who held a discussion regarding the site, said villagers do not want garbage there.
“We got PCMC to move out of the area and will not allow PMC to have the dumping site here,” said Patil.
PMC authorities are waiting for state government clearance for the site they selected from 85 sites — mostly unused quarries — proposed by the district administration.
“We found Moshi suitable. It is a government site. With population increasing and issues arising at Uruli Devachi and Phursungi, this will be an added option,” said a PMC officer.
PMC officials said the Hanjer garbage processing and recycling plant was not working to capacity, causing problems. About 1,600 tonne garbage is generated every day and if all these plants and sites work to full capacity, the issue can be sorted out, they said.
PMC has been looking for new sites to dump garbage ever since residents of Uruli Devachi and Phursungi — villages used for years to dump waste — objected. PMC’s plan at Moshi angered Moshi residents, who have been demanding PCMC to stop dumping waste there.
About 650 tonne solid waste is generated within PCMC jurisdiction daily.This waste is processed at a unit in Moshi. But, given the population explosion, the need for a new garbage depot was felt and Punawale off Katraj-Dehu Road bypass is being assessed to reduce the garbage burden on Moshi, officials said.
In the past, PMC had given the government Rs 2.62 crore for two sites required, but opposition from people stalled it. “There will be opposition everywhere but the government will have to take a call soon,” officials said.
Among government sites proposed by the collectorate, two are at Wadgaon Shinde, two at Wagholi and one at Hadapsar. The sites of private owners were at Dhanori (5 sites), Wadgaon Shinde (12), Wagholi (39), Loni Khand (25) and Wadgaon Dhairi (8). The sites will have to be filled after acquisition, which would take time, said civic officials. “Of these, most quarries are abandoned. Quarries near the airport cannot be used for dumping and can only be used after permission from Indian Air Force and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board,” said officials.
A deadline of December 31 has been set, following protests by Phursungi villagers and intervention of the CM, to shift the present dumping site. PMC has two new processing plants. “With more villages continued…

The market is likely to be driven more by global cues than local factors for now. Investors could get a bit unnerved as FIIs and DIIs turned net sellers on Tuesday. Global cues will play a major factor in the coming days for want of other reasons.
Investors will closely watch the developments in Japan too. News flow from Germany is also awaited.
The outlook is a positive start. Indices could cool soon. The total market valuation of the BSE-listed companies could cross the Rs. 100 lakh crore-mark if the sentiment remains upbeat today. The BSE has decided to shift stocks of 55 companies to the restricted trading segment from next week.
The Dow 0.23% while S&P 500 added 0.51%. The Nasdaq added 0.67%. Asian markets are lackluster. Nikkei was marginally higher while Hang Seng has shed half a percent. Kospi and Shanghai are also trading lower.
The Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of Australia reaffirmed that the Strategic Partnership between India and Australia is based on converging political, economic and strategic interests; a shared desire to promote regional and global peace, security and prosperity; and a commitment to democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law.
Moody's Investors Service says its outlook on Asia's non-financial corporates (excluding Japan) remains stable, reflecting a modest improvement in external demand, led by the US, still-accommodative global monetary conditions, and an orderly economic rebalancing in China.
Shares of jewellery companies are trading lower on reports that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may increase the restrictions on gold imports.Shares of Titan Company was down 1% at Rs373, while Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri is down 2% at Rs157.Tara jewels shares were lower by 2% at Rs93, has dipped 1%. 
RBI deputy governor S.S. Mundra reportedly said policymakers are concerned that higher gold imports will worsen the trade deficit.
Shares of Punj Lloyd Group has hit 5% upper circuit at Rs40 after the company bagged Rs 666 Crores Asian Highway contract from the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways
Shares of Rasoya Proteins Ltd hit 20% lower circuit at Rs4.Last week, the company has posted its Q2 results.
Shares of Adani Enterprises was flat at Rs496 after the company received support from Indian and Australian government to help to build a $ 7 billion coal mine, rail and port.

Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd has sued US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for revoking approvals granted to the firm to launch copies of two drugs including AstraZeneca Plc's heartburn pill Nexium, according to reports.Last month, FDA told Ranbaxy that it believed its decisions to grant the company tentative approvals for copies of Nexium and Roche AG's antiviral Valcyte were "in error".

Surprising career-killing habitsBeat illness without going broke
Jack Welch, executive chairman at Jack Welch Management Institute
“Careers rarely follow a smooth, linear trajectory,” wrote Welch in his post 10 Behaviours That Could Kill Your Career . “If you’re experiencing a stalled or faltering career — and most of us do at some point or another — take a good look in the mirror.”
There are career-killing behaviours that many people do not recognise, but “can mean the difference between an upward ride and a downward spiral at work,” he wrote. Among them:
Overcommitting and under-delivering
Resistance to change — failing to embrace new ideas
Winning over your boss but not your peer group
Complacency — you’ve stopped growing
Being a problem identifier versus a problem solver
“If you recognise your own behaviours, make it your mission to change them — before you have to,” advised Welch. If you do, he wrote, your career is “likely to… move from a stall to a soar.”
Linda Descano, managing director and global head of content & social at Citi
New research from Citi and LinkedIn revealed that “men are less likely than women to share news of professional accomplishments at work,” wrote Descano in her post 5 Ways to Promote Yourself at Work — Without “Bragging” .
“Men [were] also more likely to view self-promotion as being in poor taste, which is perhaps why many of the women respondents expressed concern that their efforts to self-promote… will backfire on them,” she wrote. So how, exactly, can someone with big aspirations promote themselves without damaging their reputation?
Descano asked a group of executive coaches for their perspectives. Among their advice:
“Communicate, communicate, communicate,” wrote Diane Baranello of Coaching for Distinction. “Do it clearly, articulating the difference you make and why it is important to the business. Do it consistently. Do it confidently. In other words, don't apologise for speaking up, speaking out or speaking truth.”
“The most effective way to establish the credibility and visibility [that women]  desire without the backlash is to focus on their value proposition (the unique way they do their work that adds value to the business),” wrote Bonnie Marcus of Women’s Success Coaching. “Once they understand this, they can offer to help others achieve their business goals based on what value they know they can add. Instead of talking about past accomplishments — which might be interpreted as bragging — if they position themselves as having the potential to solve on-going challenges in the business, it establishes them as a leader who is willing to work for the benefit of the organisation and not for self-gain.”
"Include an 'I' and 'we' mention,” suggested Nancy Joyce of Joyce Advisors. “Many women are uncomfortable using 'I' when self-promoting. Research shows that if you only use 'we,' you may not get personal credit. On the other hand, if you use 'I' you may get a reputation as someone who’s not a team player.” How does one accomplish this balance? Joyce offers this example. For instance, you could say, “The brand positioning strategy exercise I took the team through has really paid off. We have developed some innovative ideas and the team has fully embraced the effort.'"

FY15 current account deficit estimated at $36.7 bn or 1.8 pct of GDP in India: Citigroup'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
India’s current account deficit (CAD) for the current financial year is expected to be $36.7 billion, or 1.8 per cent of GDP, despite a fall in exports and rise in imports, says a Citigroup report.
“We maintain our view of FY15 CAD at $36.7 billion (1.8 per cent of GDP), with risks balanced,” Citigroup said in a research note today.
As per the global financial services major, the risks appears to be balanced. Sharp drop in oil prices helped in containing imports at $39.5 billion and this in turn helped in offsetting weak exports.
Exports at $26.1 billion contracted for the first time in five months — across petroleum products, engineering goods, gems and jewellery.
“While petro-products account for around 23 per cent of total exports where crude prices have an impact, the slowdown in non-oil exports reflect global weakness and remains a concern,” the report said. This is the largest component in computing CAD is trade deficit.
India’s trade deficit widened to $13.35 billion in October as exports contracted 5.04 per cent and gold imports surged.
Exports entered the negative zone after a gap of six months during October.
The report said that stable CAD and slowing inflation are likely to be Indian rupee supportive.
While there could be occasional bouts of emerging market volatility, the adequate reserves ($316 billion) and long forward position (more than $8.4 billion by end September) built by RBI is likely to help contain the volatility, the report said.
“We expect Indian rupee to remain anchored around its fair value of 60-62,” Citigroup said.
The rupee is currently hovering around Rs 61/US dollar level.
According to Citigroup estimates, the FY15 average for crude is $100/bbl and if oil prices stay at current levels the net oil import bill would be lower by $4.5/bbl.
Exports on the other hand could be slightly weaker (FY15 growth assumed at 7.5 per cent), given weak demand conditions in Europe and China which account for 28 per cent of exports.
FM Arun Jaitley’s thoughts, actions augur well for economy, equities: Citi
Government’s reform measures on GST, labour and land acquisition laws should augur well for the economy and equity markets, global brokerage firm Citigroup said today.
It said there is a lot happening that should see the light soon with respect to Goods and Services Tax (GST), land acquisition law modifications and changes to labor laws.
“The FM’s thoughts and actions should augur very well for India’s economy and its equity market,” Citigroup said in a report on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s meeting with investors yesterday.
“We were impressed … believe the market should be too,” Citigroup said, adding the government has cleared environmental backlog, FDI in defence and railway infrastructure and diesel deregulation.
Also the resolution to coal sector problems and opening up of commercial mining and planned increased in FDI cap in insurance sector have buoyed market sentiments.
“Action does speak louder than words. The market and mood have moved up … on expectations yes, but on a lot of action too,” it said.
The Minister sees high cost of capital, domestic bank financing, legal framework for contract enforcement and the weak global environment as challenges, it added.

Ask Matt: Can dividends keep risingAP
Q: Can dividends keep rising?
A: Investors have gotten spoiled by massive dividend increases over the years. And if indications are a guide, the growth is expected to keep coming.
Dividend hikes are expected to be up by a double-digit percentage this year, says Howard Silverblatt at S&P Dow Jones Indices. If this estimate is correct, 2014 would mark the third year in a row dividends have risen by 10% or more annually. A third year of increases would be a welcome change from 2010 when dividends were collectively cut by 21%, Silverblatt says. Companies have been aggressively boosting their dividends as investors pressure firms to return their mounting piles of cash. Corporate profits continue to rise this year despite anemic revenue growth. Companies continue to drive strong profit margins and find ways to reduce costs. Companies, too, are ramping up their level of stock repurchases, but dividends are still a popular way to return capital to investors. Much could change to slow down dividends. Talk of changing taxation of dividends could put a chill on dividend hikes in 2015. But barring that kind of macro shift, 364 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 have signaled that they plan to pay higher indicated dividend rates in 2015 than they did in 2013.

Kolkata worst in terms of sanitation facilities: surveyIn New York, Arvind Kejriwal says AAP set for face-off with BJP in Delhi elections
‘City of Joy’ Kolkata, a major tourist magnet, has been ranked worst in terms of sanitation facilities for tourists, according to a survey.
About 74 per cent of the total respondents placed Kolkata on the top of the list of tourist locations which require upgrading of sanitary restroom facilities followed by Mumbai with 72 per cent.
The two mega cities are followed by Chennai (71 per cent), Bangalore (53 per cent), Pune (per cent), Delhi (47 per cent) and Hyderabad (31 per cent).
The survey conducted by private travel portal HolidayIQ.com, was inspired by Prime Minster Narendra Modi’s ‘Clean India’ campaign, and emphasises on the need to establish “well-maintained” toilets across the country.
It was conducted in seven cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Pune and Hyderabad — on a sample size of 10,000 respondents.
Also, 88.31 per cent of the total respondents felt that railway stations across the country required major improvement in toilet facilities.
Nearly 88 per cent felt that public places in cities also lacked adequate toilet facilities, followed by 79.17 per cent who consider that the facilities need to be upgraded in tourist, religious or heritage sites.
With India observing the ‘World Toilet Day’ tomorrow, the company states that even at some of the world’s most frequented sightseeing sites in India, travellers often complain about standing in long queues outside stinking toilets and rank it among the worst tourist experiences in the world.
“Most people in India actually choose their travel destinations based on the restroom experience they can expect. This is especially true for women, and even truer for mothers who shop or travel with small children.
“Having accessibility to cleaner toilets on a holiday is one of the key requirements of a modern traveller and it tends to influence their travel plans. Poorly maintained restrooms at some of India’s most famous tourist sites is an issue travellers face. As always, being India’s largest travel community, this survey aims to reflect the voice of Indian travellers,” its CEO said.
Of the total 10,000 respondents who participated in the survey, 79 per cent were women.

IIM-A hikes fee by hefty 11% across programmes'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
Management education at the country’s top notch B-schools, the IIMs, is set to burn a bigger hole in the pocket with the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) taking the lead this time announcing a hefty 11% fee hike after a hiatus of two years. The IIM-A on Tuesday announced a hike in fees across all its programmes, raising the fee of its flagship programmes — PGP and PGP-FABM (Food and Agri Business Management) — from R16.6 lakh to R18.5 lakh. The fee of the PGPX course has also been increased to R24 lakh from R21.5 lakh for the batch starting April 2015.
Attributing the hike in the fees to inflation as well as rising administrative costs, Professor Ashish Nanda, director, IIMA, said, “There has been a steady rise in the expenses and when students who pass out of this institute go on to become leaders of corporates, it is only fair that they invest in their education. This should not be passed on to the taxpayers. However, even as the institute raises its fees, we emphasise our commitment to providing generous financial aid and working intensively with financial institutions to make educational loans easily available, so as to ensure that capable students continue to be able to join IIM-A, irrespective of their financial means,” said Nanda while addressing the media on Tuesday.
“For the PGP and PGP-FABM programmes, the tuition fee increase is 10%, whereas administrative costs (for hostel, facilities, academic support, etc) have increased at a higher pace owing to inflation. The cumulative fee increase for all three programmes of about 11.5% equates to about 3.7% annual increase over the three years. Even as IIM-A has been under increasing cost pressure, it has been committed to providing education to all capable students. IIM-A disbursed financial aid of R7.55 crore to 295 students in 2012-13 and R6.94 crore to 242 students in 2013-14, which, to our understanding, represents a significantly broader and deeper commitment than do the financial aid programmes of comparable institutions. IIM-A has also worked intensively with FIs and currently several banks are offering students loans covering 100% of their educational cost,” added Nanda.
In another major initiative to expand its global footprint, the institute is also introducing supernumerary seats for foreign nationals. IIM-A will offer seats over its present capacity to foreign students for the PGP course. “Our objective is to get quality foreign students to bring in diversity, and also to position the institute as a global learning destination for management students,” said Professor Ajay Pandey, dean programmes, IIM-A.

US: House Democrats re-elect Pelosi as minority leaderDemocrats re-elected Rep Nancy Pelosi to another two-year term as House minority leader on Tuesday.
By: Associated Press | Washington | Posted: November 18, 2014 11:23 pm
Democrats re-elected Rep Nancy Pelosi to another two-year term as House minority leader on Tuesday, two weeks after elections in which the party lost at least a dozen seats in the chamber.
In a closed-door meeting of House Democrats, Pelosi was re-elected by voice vote in a race in which she faced no challenger.
A Democrat who was in the meeting relayed the outcome to The Associated Press on grounds of anonymity because the party had not yet officially announced it.
The California Democrat has been party leader in the chamber since 2003, including four years in which she was the first female House speaker.
Pelosi is deeply popular with liberals. Countless Republican campaign ads have sought to make her their symbol of a profligate government that doesn’t know how to say no to spending proposals or interest groups.
No 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland was re-elected and the party’s other leaders were expected to be given new terms. None faced known opponents.
Pelosi, 74, was victorious despite some grumbling that the leadership needs fresh blood and that the party did an inadequate job of selling its policies to voters. Many Democrats also blamed their recent losses on an unfriendly political climate beyond their control, including President Barack Obama’s unpopularity.
“We got hammered in the election,” Rep. Peter Welch, a Democrat, said yesterday. “Was it Pelosi? Most of us say the answer is no.”
Pelosi and Hoyer, 75, have led House Democrats for the past dozen years, eight of them in the minority. Democrats controlled the chamber from 2007 through 2010 but lost a disastrous 63 seats in that year’s elections and have been in the minority ever since.
In this month’s elections, Democrats lost at least a dozen House seats, with three races undecided. Republicans will hold at least 246 House seats in the 435-member chamber, the most since the 1940s.
Democrats consider Pelosi a tough leader and tremendous financial asset.
Her aides say she’s raised over USD 101 million over the past two years for House Democrats, appearing at 750 campaign events in 115 cities.
That’s about the same amount raised by House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, making Pelosi’s total impressive because she was collecting cash for a party that no one expected to capture a House majority.
Some Democratic senators expressed displeasure with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid after they lost at least eight Senate seats, costing them control of that 100-member chamber next year. Reid was nonetheless re-elected.

French President Hollande condemns terrifying Jerusalem attackFive Israelis were killed in the rare assault on a place of worship when two Palestinians armed with a gun
By: Agence-France Presse | Canberra | Posted: November 19, 2014 9:11 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 10:41 am
French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday condemned the “terrifying” attack on a synagogue in West Jerusalem, urging Israel and the Palestinians to resume talks seeking peace.
Five Israelis were killed in the rare assault on a place of worship when two Palestinians armed with a gun and meat cleavers ran amok among worshippers yesterday, sending shockwaves through the country.
“Yesterday there was an attack on a synagogue in Jerusalem which was particularly terrifying…and this is unfortunately the trend in terms of what’s happening,” Hollande said in Australia during a state visit.
“So we must be very clear that we condemn these sort of actions. This is something that occurred in a place of worship. We must act to ensure that violence in Jerusalem ceases, and that conditions for resuming talks may finally be such that this dialogue can occur,” he added.
Four of the victims were Israelis with dual nationality – three US citizens and a Briton, police said. Israel’s leading ultra-Orthodox website said they were all rabbis. A policeman also died of his wounds.

India extends 75 million dollar credit line to FijiPrint
Modi in Fiji.
By: Press Trust of India | Suva | Posted: November 19, 2014 8:59 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 10:14 pm
Seeking stronger engagement with the Pacific Islands, India on Wednesday announced a 75 million of credit for Fiji for a co-generation power plant and upgrading the sugar industry and also a five million USD fund to develop its villages even as the two countries agreed to expand their defence and security cooperation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made these announcements after talks with his Fijian counterpart Frank Bainimarama shortly after his arrival, also announced a visa on arrival for Fijians and assistance projects that included a parliament library and doubling the scholarships and training slots in India for people from this country.
The lines of credit were part of three agreements signed between the two countries in the presence of the two leaders.
Modi arrived here at the crack of dawn on the third and final leg of his 10-day three-nation tour, for a day-long visit, the first by an Indian premier to the country in 33 years after Indira Gandhi in 1981.

The tiny remote pacific Island nation rolled out the red carpet for Modi, who was received by Frank Bainimarama, a former military ruler, at the Suva International airport.
Bainimarama was sworn in as Prime Minister on September 22 after the first parliamentary elections in the pacific nation since he seized power in a coup in 2006.
Modi was accorded a ceremonial guard of honour at the airport after which he attended the traditional ceremony of Welcome at Albert park, close to the Prime Minister’s office and Parliament.
He shook hands with people from the Indian diaspora assembled at the ground as he walked past the enclosures.

“It is a new day and a new beginning in our relations with Fiji,” Modi said in remarks to the media at a joint appearance with Bainimarama at the prime Minister’s office.
“Fiji could serve as a hub for stronger Indian engagement with Pacific islands. I see this visit as an opportunity to renew an old relationship and lay the foundation for a strong partnership in the future,” he added.
Modi also addressed Fijian parliament, the first by a foreign leader, after parliamentary elections, during which he said that India was prepared to work with Fiji to build a “Digital Fiji”.
The Line of Credit included USD 70 million for a co-generation power plant at Rarav sugar mill and USD five million to strengthen and modernise Fiji’s village, small and medium scale industries.
“I regard Fiji as an important partner for India. We have deep and enduring ties of history and culture. Fiji is an influential voice in the Pacific Region and the developing world, and our partner in multilateral institutions,” Modi said at his joint press interaction.

Reciprocating Modi’s sentiments, Bainimarama said the Indian Prime minister’s visit has laid the groundwork for “productive relationship” between the two countries.
“We are proud to have India as a partner in Fiji’s future,” he said, adding that 15 more bilateral agreements are in the works.
Modi touched a chord at all his events starting his speeches with a Fijian greeting “Nissan Vola” and ending them with “Vinaka” (Thank You).
“We will also expand our defence and security cooperation, including assistance in defence training and capacity building. We agreed to identify opportunities to expand our trade and investments and work out a concrete roadmap,” Modi said.
He said that India looks forward to closer engagement in areas like information technology and Space applications.
“I want to offer to convey a special word of gratitude from the people of India for hosting Indian scientists for tracking India’s Mars Mission earlier this year. Together we made history,” the prime minister said.
“We are also prepared to increase cooperation in renewable energy, especially solar and wind energy, and in building capacity to adapt to climate change,” he added.
He also suggested Fijian leaders to invite Bollywood to shoot their films in Fiji to attract more Indian tourists.
“Fiji is a leader in the region and a strong voice in the developing world. Together, we can also work for a future in the region, in which there is an equal place for all nations – big and small, developed and developing – and a climate of peace and tranquility,” he added.

US: Right-to-die advocates mom blasts Vatican remarksIn this file photo, Brittany Maynard, left, hugs her mother Debbie Ziegler.
By: Associated Press | Portland | Posted: November 19, 2014 6:06 am
The mother of a right-to-die advocate responded angrily to criticism from the Vatican of Brittany Maynard’s decision to end her life early under an Oregon law written to let terminally ill patients die on their own terms.
Days after Maynard’s November 1 death at age 29, the Vatican’s top bioethics official called her choice “reprehensible” and said physician-assisted suicide should be condemned.
Maynard’s mother, Debbie Ziegler, issued a sharp written response Tuesday. She said the comments from Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, came as the family was grieving and were “more than a slap in the face.”
Her response was made through Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group that Maynard worked with in her last days.
Maynard suffered from terminal brain cancer and in the spring was given six months to live. She moved to Oregon from Northern California with her husband and parents because Oregon allows terminally ill patients to die using lethal medications prescribed by a doctor.
Maynard used her story to speak out for the right of the terminally ill to end their lives on their own terms. A media campaign by her and Compassion & Choices sparked a national debate.
Five US states allow patients to seek aid in dying: Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico.
Some religious groups and social conservatives, including the American Life League, also have criticized Maynard’s decision.
Pope Francis denounced the right-to-die movement Saturday, saying euthanasia is a sin against God and creation. Thinking of euthanasia as an act of dignity provides a “false sense of compassion,” Francis said. He didn’t refer specifically to Maynard’s case.
In the letter, Ziegler called her terminally ill daughter’s decision to die a human rights issue. Maynard’s family has since moved back to California.
“My twenty-nine-year-old daughter’s choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation,” Ziegler wrote.
Ziegler encouraged people to consider all the options when faced with an incurable, debilitating, painful disease.
“The ‘culture of cure’ has led to a fairy tale belief that doctors can always fix our problems,” she wrote.
On Thursday, the day Maynard would have turned 30, Compassion & Choices plans to release a video she made before her death. The group also will call for expanded laws that allow the terminally ill to end their lives.
Oregon was the first state to make it legal for a doctor to prescribe a life-ending drug to a terminally ill patient of sound mind who makes the request. The patient must swallow the drug without help; it is illegal for a doctor to administer it.
More than 750 people in Oregon had used the law to die as of December 31, 2013. The median age continued…

Israel shaken by five deaths  vows harsh response to synagogue attackIsrael vowed harsh retaliation Tuesday for a Palestinian attack that killed five people.
By: Associated Press | Jerusalem | Posted: November 19, 2014 5:13 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 4:02 pm
Israel vowed harsh retaliation Tuesday for a Palestinian attack that killed five people and left blood-smeared prayer books and shawls on the floor of a synagogue in Jerusalem – an assault that sharply escalated already-high tensions after weeks of religious violence.
The attack during morning prayers in the west Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof was carried out by two Palestinian cousins wielding meat cleavers, knives and a handgun. They were shot to death by police after the deadliest assault in the holy city since 2008.
Four of the dead were rabbis and one was a police officer who died of his wounds hours after the attack. Three of the rabbis were born in the United States and the fourth was born in England, although all held dual Israeli citizenship. Five others were wounded.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack, the first time he has done so in the wave of deadly violence against Israelis. But he also called for an end to Israeli “provocations” surrounding Jerusalem’s shrines that are sacred to both Muslims and Jews.
President Barack Obama called the attack “horrific” and without justification, urging cooperation from both sides to ease tensions and adding that too many Israelis and Palestinians have died in recent months,
Tuesday’s attack, however, appeared to mark a turning point, with the gruesome scene in a house of worship shocking a nation long accustomed to violence.
The government released a photo of a meat cleaver it said came from the crime scene. Government video showed blood-soaked prayer books and prayer shawls in the synagogue. A pair of glasses lay under a table, and thick streaks of blood smeared the floor.
“I saw people lying on the floor, blood everywhere,” said Yosef Posternak, who was at the synagogue in the quiet neighborhood that has a large community of English-speaking immigrants.
“People were trying to fight with (the attackers) but they didn’t have much of a chance,” Posternak told Israel Radio.
In one of Israel’s first acts of retaliation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the demolitions of the homes of the attackers. But halting further violence could prove to be a tough challenge as police confront a new threat: Lightly armed assailants from annexed east Jerusalem who hold residency rights that allow them to move freely throughout the country.
Netanyahu condemned the deaths of the “innocent and pure Jews.” In a nationally televised address, he accused Abbas of inciting the recent violence and said the Palestinian leader’s condemnation of the attack was insufficient.
Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs the Gaza Strip, praised the attack. In Gaza, dozens celebrated in the streets, with some offering trays full of candy.
The U.S.-born victims were identified as Moshe Twersky, 59, Aryeh Kupinsky, 43, and Kalman Levine, 55. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the British man was Avraham Goldberg, 68, who immigrated to Israel continued…

Vitamin D helps relieve pain among diabetic patients: StudyPrint
Written by Tanbir Dhaliwal | Chandigarh | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:56 am
The burning sensation and severe pain, which diabetic patients usually suffer from, can be relieved to some extent by taking vitamin D, according to a study presented during a national conference of endocrinologists at PGI last week.
With time, diabetic patients develop nerve damage throughout the body, which causes pain, tingling, or numbness in the hands, arms, feet and legs, and can also affect organs like the digestive tract and the heart. These disorders are called diabetic peripheral neuropathies.
The study, conducted by endocrinologists from Chennai-based Sri Ramachandra University, found that vitamin D supplementation decreases the severity of symptoms in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
Conducted by Bubblu Tamilselvan, Nagendra Kumar, Krishna Seshadri, Manu Kurian and Lakshmi G, the 24-week-long study covered 45 patients with type 2 diabetes who suffered from typical motor and sensory neuropathy symptoms and had low vitamin D levels.
Patients with vitamin D levels less than 30ng/ml (nanogram per millilitre) were supplemented with 60,000IU (international units) of vitamin D per week for a period of six weeks, followed by 2,000IU vitamin D per day for 18 weeks. Patients with vitamin D levels within the range of 30 to 50ng/ml were supplemented with 2,000IU vitamin D per day for 24 weeks.
The patients showed a decrease in the severity of neuropathy symptoms. With changes in vitamin D level in their blood, their diabetic neuropathy score, and the neuropathy disability score improved, the study noted.
In diabetic neuropathy score, the symptoms of the patients are graded from 1 to 4. Neuropathy disability score is decided after examining the patient on the basis of DNS and varies from 1 to 10. The higher the score, the more severe the problem.

Foundation stone laid twice in 13 yrs  subway in Aggar Nagar opens finallyThe Aggar Nagar subway on Tuesday.
Written by Divya Goyal | Ludhiana | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:56 am
It’s foundation stone laid twice in 13 years — in 2001 and 2010 by the SAD-BJP government — the subway in Aggar Nagar, Ferozepur road, connecting Block A and B, was finally thrown open to public on Tuesday.
While the district administration in its official statement claimed that the foundation stone was laid only once in 2010 by Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, it was on June 10, 2001, that Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal laid the first foundation stone of ‘Maharaja Aggarsain Pedestrial Subway’ and also released Rs 21 lakh as first instalment in 2001. But the project failed to take off. The stone was laid again in 2010 by Sukhbir.
Meanwhile, Punjab Irrigation Minister Sharanjit Singh Dhillon came out against the BJP’s former MP Navjot Singh Sidhu and said that “some political leaders are issuing false statements to merely highlight their personal grudges”.
“But the SAD-BJP workers are well aware of such mischievous tactics and will not fall prey to them,” Dhillon said after inaugurating the subway in Aggar Nagar.
Sidhu lashed out at the Shiromani Akali Dal during the recent Rath Yatra in Ludhiana on Sunday and said that “Akali Dal is doing only 10% sewa and eating 90% mewa”. It was a satire on the SAD’s slogan ‘Raj Nahi Sewa’.
Acting on Sidhu’s comment, the SAD lodged a formal complaint with the BJP. Education Minister Daljeet Singh Cheema, who was in the city on Monday, said that the “SAD has lodged a formal complaint against Sidhu with BJP”.
Dhillon added that “some of their political opponents claimed in the social media that the state government is shying away from sanctioning tax-free status for Punjabi film Char Sahibzaade”.
“Our government has already sanctioned tax-free status for this film and people should remain vigilant from such people who try to misguide,” he said.
Rajinder Bhandari, vice-chairman, Punjab State Planning Board and a senior BJP leader, was also present during the inauguration. “SAD and BJP do not have any differences,” he claimed.
Constructed at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore, the subway is 177 feet long and 45 feet wide and has 13 shops. The residents of Aggar Nagar heaved a sigh of relief as the garbage dump near the subway was cleared for the minister’s arrival. “We hope that the dump is not visible after inauguration too as it was cleared in two days due to minister’s arrival. We always complained but no one from MC listened and it was a complete nuisance created by stray cattle and dogs here,” said Pankaj Jindal, a resident of the area.
“This cleanliness should continue and also we want a security guard to be hired at subway as girls who take tuition in other block or go to Tagore Public School in A-block will face problems,” said Sangeeta Garg, another resident.
Meanwhile, it was another photo-op for the SAD and BJP leaders who were seen trying to hog the continued…

Verka starts delivery of milk products in rural areasAjmer Singh Bhagpur flags off the home delivery van for rural areas, in Ludhiana on Tuesday.
Written by Raakhi Jagga | Ludhiana | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:56 am
To enhance the sale of milk products and also to tap the unexplored rural belt, Verka Milk Plant on Tuesday started supply of its milk products to the co-operative societies located in rural areas. Till now, the supply was focused only on urban areas.
On Tuesday, two fully loaded vans were flagged off by plant chairman Ajmer Singh Bhagpur which will supply to about 100 co-operative societies falling on Ferozepur road and Chandigarh roadside villages in the coming three days. “Villagers are also eager to have ready-to-eat milk products like urbanites, and supply was started as per demand,” said Bhagpur.
While flagging off the vans, Bhagpur said, “With this, Verka Milk plant of Ludhiana becomes the first co-operative plant in north India to start home delivery in rural areas. Till now, our milk packets were available in the offices of co-operative societies and a few of them used to take our products. But now they will be seen in all the villages which are connected with us.”
The products include kaju pinni, panjiri, cheese, desi ghee, curd, kheer, flavoured lassi, butter milk, butter and tetra packs.
Amarjeet Singh, GM of the plant, said, “Though it was a notion earlier that villagers don’t like desi ghee, kaju pinni or panjiri which is available in the market, to our surprise, we started this service on a demand basis.”
Rajinder Deora, marketing manager of the plant, said, “Already in Ludhiana city area, we are supplying 70 tonnes of desi ghee while 40 tonnes of butter on a daily basis. With the rural belt, we are expecting that our demand will jump by 15% at least.”
Bhagpur stated that they used to tell members of the co-operative societies regularly to take milk products as well, but the response was lukewarm. “Once we have started home delivery, they are more than eager to take our products. This will boost the sale of the plant and will also provide our products to people at their doorstep,” he added.

Rupee closes flat against US dollarFOREX UPDATE: Rupee closes flat against US dollar

In lackluster trade, the Indian rupee on Monday closed almost flat at 61.73 against the Greenback on alternate bouts of demand and supply amid rise in dollar value overseas.
While the marginal drop in rupee was its third straight session of decline, the local currency seemed to hold steady compared to Asian peers, who saw volatility after data showed Japan slipping into recession, said forex experts.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced strong at 61.63 a dollar from previous close of 61.72, but later declined to a low of 61.7875 before settling at 61.73, showing a fall of a mere one paise or 0.02 per cent.
The dollar was trading strong in overseas market as the dollar index was up by 0.13 per cent against its major six global rivals.
The benchmark S&P Sensex improved further by over 131 points, or 0.47 per cent to end at new peak while FIIs bought shares worth $109.58 million last Friday.
Good capital inflows in Indian equities cushioned the rupee fall, a forex dealer said.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said,"Rupee is expected to appreciate in coming days tracking gains in local equities. The trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.20 to 62.00." .

Having established itself as a preferred investment destination, Gujarat is now projecting it as a global platform for exchange of ideas and to attract investment for all Indian States.
The transformation will be seen from the forthcoming Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2015 scheduled in Gandhinagar from January 11 and 13. Aptly the theme is Empowering India.
Calling Gujarat as the Davos of the East, State Minister for Finance, Energy & Petro chemicals Saurabhbhai Patel said the State started on a small note with respect to Vibrant Gujarat, but today the event had emerged as one of the world’s successful global investment summits.
“We are not limiting this summit as a business destination for the State. Any Indian State can attract investment from here. We are not here to attract investment from Maharashtra to Gujarat. We are here to invite the businessmen of Maharashtra to come to Vibrant Gujarat and find partners, meet delegates from different parts of the country and the world and have joint ventures even in Maharashtra. We are making it a big platform for business,” Mr. Patel told The Hindu.
Gujarat Chief Secretary D. J. Pandian said: “We want to make Vibrant Gujarat a global knowledge forum where everybody can come, share knowledge and know how to do business and how to invest. Our emphasis is on inclusive growth. We are not at the stage of attracting investment to Gujarat any more. Gujarat is on auto mode to attract investment.”
Addressing the Vibrant Gujarat 2015 Road Show here, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel said the summit would have business leaders deliberating on innovation, climate change, MSME development and much more.
“Inclusive growth and last mile delivery is Gujarat’s mantra for development,” she said.
Gujarat is now gearing up to promote investment in the defence sector.

Gold, silver fall on easing demand

market and exchange
Gold prices on Monday declined by Rs 90 to Rs 26,760 per ten grams in the National Capital after the demand from jewellers and retailers eased at prevailing levels amid a weak trend overseas.
Silver also fell by Rs 200 to Rs 36,500 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said fall in demand at prevailing higher levels from jewellers and retailers and a weak trend in global markets mainly kept pressure on precious metal prices.
Gold prices fell by 0.19 per cent to USD 1186.30 an ounce in early trading in the global market. Silver too eased by 1.62 per cent to USD 16.06 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity declined by Rs 90 each to Rs 26,760 and Rs 26,560 per ten grams respectively.
Sovereign, however, held steady at Rs 23,800 per piece of eight gram.
In line with a general weak trend, silver ready traded lower by Rs 200 to Rs 36,500 per kg but weekly-based delivery edged up by Rs 125 to Rs 36,155 per kg on speculative buying.
On the other hand, silver coins ruled steady at Rs 60,000 for buying and Rs 61,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

The rupee strengthened by five paise to 61.67 against the US dollar in early trade on Monday at the Interbank Foreign Exchange on selling of the US currency by exporters and banks amid sustained capital inflows.
The rupee depreciated by 17 paise to end at nearly one-month low of 61.72 against the greenback on Friday on sustained dollar demand even as domestic equities surged to new highs.
Traders said besides selling of the American currency by exporters and banks, continued foreign fund inflows helped the local currency to strengthen, but the dollar’s gains against rivals overseas and a lower opening in the domestic equity market capped the rupee’s rise.
Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex fell 44.51 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 28,002.15 in early trade on Monday.

Apple may become first $1 trillion companyApple may become first $1 trillion company

Is Apple (AAPL) about to be the first $1 trillion company? More investors are starting to say so.
Apple is currently worth close to $670 billion. That’s more valuable than any other company in the S&P 500. Microsoft is Number 2 at $409 billion.
But can the maker of iPhones hit the one trillion mark? That’s been the elusive goal of companies for years. During the dot-com boom — promising Internet stocks looked bound for a 13-digit valuation. We all know how that turned out.
Some think this time is different. Famous investor Carl Icahn says Apple could hit a trillion dollar valuation. And Monday, Steve Einhorn of Omega Advisors also said Apple could hit the trillion-dollar mark.
Analysts certainly aren’t ready to go this far yet. The average 18-month analyst target is $117 a share. That puts Apple at a market value of $686 billion. The stock needs to go to $167 a share to hit $1 trillion. That’s 46% higher than the where the stock is now. But remember – the stock has jumped 40% — just this year.
Will Apple be another overhyped stock that fell apart on the way to $1 trillion? Or is this time different? Investors have a trillion reasons to want to know.

Five myths about Obama s closest aideFive myths about Obama's closest aide

Barack Obama Job Market Job Reports and Statistics Valerie Jarrett National Security
White House Counselor John Podesta has called criticism of Valerie Jarrett “sexist attacks.”
Valerie Jarrett is the most talked-about White House aide in Washington — and that's not always a good thing.
Jarrett has come under attack after the midterm elections, with critics charging that she wields too much influence over her boss. Part of her mystique stems from the fact that, as other top aides have come and gone, Jarrett has survived. Her longevity and proximity to President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama have made her something of a Beltway legend and have conjured up a series of misconceptions about her. The myths:
Nobody knows what she does.
Two things are guaranteed to inspire envy or hatred in Washington: access to the president and the power to turn that access into action. The person who has both is guaranteed to face a torrent of criticism, deserved or not. In the Obama administration, no one is more envied or hated because of... ( Jonathan Capehart )
Jarrett has amassed a number of nicknames, most of them not so great: the spy, the chief sycophant, the night stalker, the Obama whisperer, the consigliere and the human decoder ring. It's as if what she does is intangible and unknowable, either too subtle or too big to grasp. During the 2008 postelection transition, she insisted on having a defined portfolio in the White House, rather than being a nebulous senior adviser. Her official, oh-so-Washington title is "senior adviser to the president of the United States and assistant to the president for public engagement and intergovernmental affairs." That's a mouthful, but her role is actually pretty simple and in line with what William Baroody Jr. did for President Gerald Ford and Minyon Moore did for President Bill Clinton: She is a conduit to people outside the White House who want to be or should be on the administration's radar.
8
This past week, when the White House released a 53-page report on the state of women and girls of color, Jarrett, in her capacity as head of the White House Council on Women and Girls, hosted a conference on the subject. When protesters in Ferguson, Mo., flooded the streets after the shooting of Michael Brown in August, she was in touch with officials there as part of constituent and government outreach. When business leaders, progressive activists, or state and local officials show up at the White House, they probably got there through Jarrett's office.
Her work is both out front and behind the scenes — assuring, sometimes chastising and cajoling, and ultimately carrying the administration's message.
She blocks Obama from making friends and hearing from different people.
Mitt Romney summed up this notion when he told The New York Times Magazine that a Republican leader had told him that Obama seems to answer to just two people: Jarrett and his wife. This is an obvious exaggeration, but it gets at the prevailing idea of Jarrett as enforcer of the Obama bubble. In addition, she reportedly said that there wouldn't be any additions to the Obamas' friendship circle once they moved to Washington. That does sound awfully cliquish.
But Jarrett has functioned as a social and political Sherpa for the Obamas, in Chicago and in Washington, and in the business world as well. She is the president's link to Vernon Jordan, a Washington fixture, and she introduced him to Wal-Mart Stores chief executive Doug McMillon and Xerox Chief Executive Ursula Burns. And when former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker was in the outer circle of Obama's economic team as head of an advisory board, it was Jarrett who made sure he got in to see the president.
None of this means that the Boehners, the McConnells and the Obamas go out for triple date night. But Jarrett has helped widen the Obamas' circle socially and among constituency groups as well. The main creator of the president's bubble is Obama himself. He seems to prefer the company and counsel of a small group of friends, family and advisers.
Her influence in the White House is unprecedented.
@DSKuberalles She's Iranian by birth. Maybe that's why fellow foreigner Barry Soetoro made her the senior adviser

She can't be contained, critics from inside and outside the White House charge; so vast is her reach, she not only vacations with the first family but also sits in on foreign policy meetings with global leaders, perhaps taking up a seat that could go to someone more versed in the issues. And the conspiracy-crazed conservative blogosphere has her colluding with the Iranians and even waving off attempts to go after Osama bin Laden.
The truth is that Obama's team of senior advisers, on everything from national security to campaign strategy, is varied, and the people in those roles have the president's ear. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates described in his memoir how, in the early Obama years, the president received input on national security matters from various sources: "The White House staff including chiefs of staff Rahm Emanuel and then Bill Daley as well as such core political advisers as Valerie Jarrett, David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs would have a role in national security decision making that I had not previously experienced (but which, I'm sure, had precedents)." Jarrett is part of a core group of people in decision-making and advisory positions. That's what it means to be a senior adviser.
Complaints about presidential advisers have a long tradition. "In almost every presidency you can name a powerful White House figure who had informal power of one kind or another that was the subject of dispute," said Kenneth Mack, a Harvard historian. "Sherman Adams had an immense amount of power in Eisenhower's White House; same with Harry Hopkins and Franklin Roosevelt."
She is a political neophyte.
Obama brought a team of Chicago insiders, including Jarrett, to the White House, and they were fairly new to the ways of Washington. Even Michelle Obama had spent little time in the capital when her husband was a senator.
Jarrett, who previously worked in city government and business, is usually not regarded as one of the political gurus who aided Obama's rise and charted his course to the White House. But her political instincts should not be underestimated. Well before the Davids (Plouffe and Axelrod) came on the scene, there was Jarrett, who essentially discovered Obama when his future wife insisted that they all meet before she accepted a job offer from Jarrett.
From there, Jarrett mentored both Obamas, believing early on that a black man named Barack Hussein Obama could become president.  Jarrett was one of the first to recognize Obama's political gifts and appeal. And she knew how to capitalize on them: During the 2008 campaign, she didn't have a formal role or portfolio but, over the objections of other senior advisers, she urged Obama to make his famous race speech in Philadelphia, in the midst of the controversy surrounding his former pastor. It was a smart and bold move, politically risky but ultimately very effective. More recently, her team helped push successfully for state and local increases in the minimum wage, staking out territory in a debate that isn't going away.
She has only two friends in the White House: Barack and Michelle.
No doubt, Jarrett is close to the president and first lady and is widely considered one of Obama's best friends. And it's no secret that former press secretary Gibbs and former chiefs of staff Emanuel and Daley all clashed with Jarrett. But often anger and frustration at the president whether within or outside the White House has been redirected at Jarrett.

Armed Men Launch Deadly Attack On Jerusalem SynagogueArmed Men Launch Attack On Jerusalem Synagogue, Killing At Least 4

JERUSALEM, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Two Palestinians armed with a  meat cleaver and a gun killed four people in a Jerusalem  synagogue on Tuesday before being shot dead by police, the  deadliest such incident in six years in the holy city amid a  surge in religious conflict.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to respond  with a "heavy hand," and again accused Western-backed  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of inciting violence in  Jerusalem.
Abbas condemned the attack, which comes after a month of  unrest fueled in part by a dispute over Jerusalem's holiest  shrine.
A worshipper at the morning service in the Kehillat Bnei  Torah synagogue in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of West  Jerusalem said about 25 people were praying when shooting broke  out.
"I looked up and saw someone shooting people at point-blank  range. Then someone came in with what looked like a butcher's  knife and he went wild," the witness, Yosef Posternak, told  Israel Radio.
Photos distributed by Israeli authorities showed a man in a  Jewish prayer shawl lying dead, a bloodied butcher's cleaver on  the floor, several overturned prayer tables and prayer books  covered in blood.
"We are viewing this as a terrorist attack," said police  spokesman Micky Rosenfeld, who confirmed the four dead and that  the two assailants, both from predominantly Arab East Jerusalem,  had been shot dead by police.
Israel's ambulance service said at least eight people were  seriously wounded.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),  said it carried out the attack.
"We declare full responsibility of the PFLP for the  execution of this heroic operation conducted by our heroes this  morning in Jerusalem," said Hani Thawbta, a PFLP leader in Gaza.
Police identified one of the dead as Rabbi Moshe Twersky,  who taught at a Jerusalem seminary. Twersky was from a Hassidic  rabbinical dynasty and a grandson of Joseph Soloveitchik, a  renowned Boston rabbi who died in 1993.
In a statement, Abbas said: "The presidency condemns the  attack on Jewish worshippers in one of their places of prayer in  West Jerusalem and condemns the killing of civilians no matter  who is doing it."
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described the attack as  an act of "pure terror," and his spokeswoman said he phoned  Netanyahu to offer condolences.
"MARTYRS"
Palestinian radio described the attackers as "martyrs" and  the Islamist group Hamas praised the attack. Loudspeakers at  mosques in Gaza called out congratulations and youngsters handed  out candy in the streets.
Palestinian media named the attackers as Ghassan and Udai  Abu Jamal, cousins from the Jerusalem district of Jabal Mukaber,  where clashes broke out as Israeli security forces moved in to  make arrests.
"Hamas calls for the continuation of revenge operations and  stresses that the Israeli occupation bears responsibility for  tension in Jerusalem," Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said.
The synagogue attack came a day after a Palestinian bus  driver was found hanged in his vehicle in Jerusalem. Israel said  an autopsy showed he committed suicide, but his family said he  was attacked. Hundreds of mourners at the driver's funeral on  Sunday chanted for revenge.
Netanyahu said the synagogue attack was "a direct result of  incitement" led by Hamas and Abbas, "incitement that the  international community has been irresponsibly ignoring."
"We will respond with a heavy hand to the brutal murder of  Jews who came to pray and were killed by lowly murderers," said  Netanyahu, who summoned his security cabinet for a special  session.
Violence in Jerusalem, areas of Israel and the  Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories has surged in the past  month, fueled in part by a dispute over Jerusalem's holiest  shrine.
Five Israelis and a foreign visitor have been deliberately  run over and killed or stabbed to death by Palestinians. About a  dozen Palestinians have also been killed, including those  accused of carrying out those attacks.
Residents trace the violence in Jerusalem to July, when a  Palestinian teenager was burned to death by Jewish assailants,  an alleged revenge attack for the abduction and killing of three  Jewish teens by Palestinian militants in the occupied West Bank.
The summer war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza  and a row over access to a Jerusalem compound that is sacred to  Muslims and Jews alike have also been triggers for violence.
The synagogue attack was the worst in the city since 2008,  when a Palestinian gunman shot dead eight people in a religious  school.
The founder of Israel's Zaka emergency service, which  attended the scene, described it as like the slaughter of Jews  in Europe during the Holocaust.
"The images I saw inside the synagogue reminded me of images  from the Holocaust -- Jews wrapped in talitot (prayer shawls)  and tefilin (phylacteries) dying in pools of their own blood on  the floor of the synagogue," Yehuda Meshi Zahav told Israel  Radio.

Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has hit out at Gurunath Meiyyapan, son-in-law of ICC President N Srinivasan, over his involvement in betting and also questioned the Tamil Nadu strongman’s silence in the whole IPL spot-fixing and scam issue.
“The full force of the law must come down on Meiyyapan,” Gavaskar said while speaking to the ‘India Today Group’ in Melbourne.
Gavaskar said Srinivasan needs to explain why he did not act against players if he knew they were involved in fixing.
“There are reports which say the Mudgal committee report has found that Srinivasan knew about betting but did not do anything about it. Srinivasan should answer for why he did not act if he knew that a player was guilty,” Gavaskar said.
Gavaskar was in Australia at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend a special reception at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was hosted by Australian PM Tony Abbot.
Several Indian and Australian cricketing legends such as Kapil Dev, VVS Laxman, Steve Waugh, Glenn McGrath, Allan Border, Jason Gillespie also attended the reception today.
Gavaskar said that there should be zero tolerance against match-fixing and betting and if any player is found guilty of having participated in wrong acts then he should be jailed and his entire cricketing history deleted from the record books.
Gavaskar said, “New Zealand has come up with a new law on betting which says that guilty players will be jailed. India should have the same law.”
The former captain also suggested that the government should think about legalising betting in India.
“A lot of betting happens through black money. But if you open official betting shop, Government will be able to increase its revenues. It’s like prohibition, if someone wants to bet illegally, they will. Government should think about legalising betting,” said Gavaskar.
The cricket legend sought to draw a distinction between team owners who were found guilty of betting and players, saying that players should not be punished till the time it can be established that the owner of the team influenced the player.
Speaking about the forthcoming India’s tour of Australia, Gavaskar said that he felt that the Indian team would face a very tough time.
“Indian players will need to be patient. They will need to keep extravagant shots in their pockets when they play in Australia. This is not T20 or One-day Internationals. Australian pitches are the best to bat on but the players have to be patient.”
Meanwhile, Gavaskar also shared some lighter moments with Prime Minister Modi while the World Cup and Border-Gavaskar trophies were being displayed for the two PMs of the two countries.
“When the photo opportunity was on, I saw Modi was holding the World Cup trophy. Abbot held the Border-Gavaskar trophy. I told the PM that you are holding the right trophy. This is the one we want next year. India already holds the Border-Gavaskar trophy, we don’t need it just now.”

Financial Technologies signs pact to sell Mauritius-based bourse for Rs 250 crBSE Sensex eases further on selling in IT sector
Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL) on Monday said it has signed a pact to sell its Mauritius-based exchange for USD 40.5 million (about Rs 250 crore) to Continental Africa Holdings Ltd.
FTIL decided to exit the exchange business and focus on its core technology business after the Rs 5,600 crore scam surfaced at its Indian subsidiary NSEL last year.
In a filing to the BSE, Jignesh Shah-led FTIL said the Board of its Mauritius-based subsidiary FT Group Investments Pvt Ltd has “approved the sale of 100 per cent of its stake in Bourse Africa Ltd, Mauritius to Continental Africa Holdings Ltd, Mauritius, for USD 40.5 million”.
The Mauritius arm today signed a definitive agreement with Continental Africa Holdings. The deal is subject to certain customary closing conditions. The entire transaction is expected to be completed within the next 210 days, it said.
Bourse Africa is an international multi-asset class exchange that offers trading on commodity derivatives, African and global currency derivatives.
In past few months, FTIL has exited from MCX and IEX. It has sold its entire 26 per cent stakes in the commodity bourse MCX for about Rs 900 crore and also sold nearly 26 per cent stake in IEX for Rs 576.84 crore.
Earlier this year, it had sold its stake in National Bulk Handling Corp for Rs 242 crore.
FTIL has been exiting the exchange business after commodity markets regulator FMC in December last year declared it to be unfit to run any exchanges in view of the NSEL payment crisis.

Foundation stone laid twice in 13 yrs  subway in Aggar Nagar opensfinallyThe Aggar Nagar subway on Tuesday.
Written by Divya Goyal | Ludhiana | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:56 am
It’s foundation stone laid twice in 13 years — in 2001 and 2010 by the SAD-BJP government — the subway in Aggar Nagar, Ferozepur road, connecting Block A and B, was finally thrown open to public on Tuesday.
While the district administration in its official statement claimed that the foundation stone was laid only once in 2010 by Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, it was on June 10, 2001, that Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal laid the first foundation stone of ‘Maharaja Aggarsain Pedestrial Subway’ and also released Rs 21 lakh as first instalment in 2001. But the project failed to take off. The stone was laid again in 2010 by Sukhbir.
Meanwhile, Punjab Irrigation Minister Sharanjit Singh Dhillon came out against the BJP’s former MP Navjot Singh Sidhu and said that “some political leaders are issuing false statements to merely highlight their personal grudges”.
“But the SAD-BJP workers are well aware of such mischievous tactics and will not fall prey to them,” Dhillon said after inaugurating the subway in Aggar Nagar.
Sidhu lashed out at the Shiromani Akali Dal during the recent Rath Yatra in Ludhiana on Sunday and said that “Akali Dal is doing only 10% sewa and eating 90% mewa”. It was a satire on the SAD’s slogan ‘Raj Nahi Sewa’.
Acting on Sidhu’s comment, the SAD lodged a formal complaint with the BJP. Education Minister Daljeet Singh Cheema, who was in the city on Monday, said that the “SAD has lodged a formal complaint against Sidhu with BJP”.
Dhillon added that “some of their political opponents claimed in the social media that the state government is shying away from sanctioning tax-free status for Punjabi film Char Sahibzaade”.
“Our government has already sanctioned tax-free status for this film and people should remain vigilant from such people who try to misguide,” he said.
Rajinder Bhandari, vice-chairman, Punjab State Planning Board and a senior BJP leader, was also present during the inauguration. “SAD and BJP do not have any differences,” he claimed.
Constructed at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore, the subway is 177 feet long and 45 feet wide and has 13 shops. The residents of Aggar Nagar heaved a sigh of relief as the garbage dump near the subway was cleared for the minister’s arrival. “We hope that the dump is not visible after inauguration too as it was cleared in two days due to minister’s arrival. We always complained but no one from MC listened and it was a complete nuisance created by stray cattle and dogs here,” said Pankaj Jindal, a resident of the area.
“This cleanliness should continue and also we want a security guard to be hired at subway as girls who take tuition in other block or go to Tagore Public School in A-block will face problems,” said Sangeeta Garg, another resident.
Meanwhile, it was another photo-op for the SAD and BJP leaders who were seen trying to hog the continued…

Verka starts delivery of milk products in ruralareasAjmer Singh Bhagpur flags off the home delivery van for rural areas, in Ludhiana on Tuesday.
Written by Raakhi Jagga | Ludhiana | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:56 am
To enhance the sale of milk products and also to tap the unexplored rural belt, Verka Milk Plant on Tuesday started supply of its milk products to the co-operative societies located in rural areas. Till now, the supply was focused only on urban areas.
On Tuesday, two fully loaded vans were flagged off by plant chairman Ajmer Singh Bhagpur which will supply to about 100 co-operative societies falling on Ferozepur road and Chandigarh roadside villages in the coming three days. “Villagers are also eager to have ready-to-eat milk products like urbanites, and supply was started as per demand,” said Bhagpur.
While flagging off the vans, Bhagpur said, “With this, Verka Milk plant of Ludhiana becomes the first co-operative plant in north India to start home delivery in rural areas. Till now, our milk packets were available in the offices of co-operative societies and a few of them used to take our products. But now they will be seen in all the villages which are connected with us.”
The products include kaju pinni, panjiri, cheese, desi ghee, curd, kheer, flavoured lassi, butter milk, butter and tetra packs.
Amarjeet Singh, GM of the plant, said, “Though it was a notion earlier that villagers don’t like desi ghee, kaju pinni or panjiri which is available in the market, to our surprise, we started this service on a demand basis.”
Rajinder Deora, marketing manager of the plant, said, “Already in Ludhiana city area, we are supplying 70 tonnes of desi ghee while 40 tonnes of butter on a daily basis. With the rural belt, we are expecting that our demand will jump by 15% at least.”
Bhagpur stated that they used to tell members of the co-operative societies regularly to take milk products as well, but the response was lukewarm. “Once we have started home delivery, they are more than eager to take our products. This will boost the sale of the plant and will also provide our products to people at their doorstep,” he added.

After Vodafone  Bombay HC strikes down tax demand on Shell tooHigh Court directive to DLF to demolish some portions of complex
The taxman’s controversial view that income could arise from share transfer between Indian arms of global companies and their foreign associates was struck down by the Bombay High Court for the second time in a little over a month on Tuesday, dispelling fears of a virtual tax on much-needed foreign direct investment (FDI). Iterating the principles laid down in its October 10 ruling in Vodafone India’s case that cross-border share transfers cannot lead to income and in the absence of an express provision to tax, the court relieved Shell India of a huge potential tax burden.
The court set aside the income tax department’s notices that sought to increase the income of the global energy giant’s Indian arm for two years — 2007-08 and 2008–2009 — by close to R18,000 crore. To seek the income addition, the taxman had applied the transfer pricing principle to Shell India’s issue of shares to its Dutch parent alleging an undervaluation.
Tuesday’s ruling by a division bench comprising of justices MS Sanklecha and SC Gupte reinforced the judicial view that cross-border share transactions can’t lead to income. The ruling almost made it certain that about two dozen other companies including some Essar Group firms, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets and Bharti Airtel which are fighting transfer pricing adjustments sought by the I-T department on similar grounds, too would get relief.
Official sources told FE that a decision on whether the government would appeal against the HC ruling on Vodafone (and now on Shell) in the Supreme Court would be taken soon. Although the Narendra Modi government has been vocal about a non-adversarial and investor-friendly tax regime, a likely Comptroller and Auditor General objection to a decision to refrain from appealing may also weigh on the government’s mind.
Welcoming the ruling, a Shell spokesperson said: “Shell has always maintained that equity infusion by a foreign parent company into an Indian subsidiary cannot be taxed as income. This is a positive outcome which should provide a further boost to the Indian government’s initiatives to improve the country’s investment climate.”
In their attempt to build a case of income suppression by the company, tax officials had claimed that Shell India’s issue of 8.7 crore shares at a face value of Rs 10 a share to Shell Gas should have actually been priced at Rs 183 a share. The department’s classification of the shortfall in share valuation as taxable income by invoking a 2012 amendment to Section 92(1) of the I-Tax Act had grabbed global headlines. In early October, the high court had struck down similar attempts by the tax department to add about Rs 5,000 crore to Vodafone India’s income for 2008-09 and 2009-10, saying the law does not expressly classify as income any discount/premium involved in international capital transactions between associated enterprises.
In what shows the government’s possible leniency on the issue, tax officers, whose mandate is to collect taxes, have now begun to talk about the need for capital inflows in the light of finance minister Arun Jaitley’s instruction to higher-ups in the department on November 7 that appeals in tax matters are to be decided “only on merit and not merely on the tax effect involved”.
Although tax authorities claimed the Shell dispute was different from Vodafone’s , the court did not find the argument valid, said sources present in the court.
“The decision of Bombay High Court confirms the concept that arm’s length principle for determination of price of a transaction should be applied only when there is income, expense or interest involved,” said SP Singh, senior director, Deloitte Haskins & Sells.
“It is a positive development which vindicates that India’s judiciary is independent and that it will not hesitate to exercise its powers to decide on writ petitions especially when tax authorities exceed their brief,” said Mukesh Butani, managing partner, BMR Legal.
Industry executives said raising a tax demand on what is essentially capital infusion was like taxing foreign direct investment. Re-characterising a capital receipt or its shortfall as income is a rare practice among tax authorities although there are a few countries that specifically provide for it in their statutes.
In the case of Vodafone India Services, the tax department considered the gap between the issue price and what it deemed as its fair value as income, holding it as the cost of fiscal benefit extended to the parent. The department also attempted to present this gap as a loan extended to the foreign parent on which the Indian unit stands to gain taxable interest income.

RBI Guv Raghuram Rajan wants focus on sustainable growth'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
India will focus on sustainable economic growth and developed economies should do the same, central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday.
The Reserve Bank of India is under corporate and government pressure to bring down interest rates and boost economic growth.
“We have to make sure that across the world we focus on sensible, sustainable sources of growth,” Rajan told reporters in Mauritius on Tuesday.
“Developing countries understand that very well … It is something that Mauritius is trying to do, it is also something that India is trying to do. It is something that even the developed world has to realise it has to do.”
India’s economy has grown at less than 5 percent  for the last two years. It picked up some momentum to grow 5.7 percent in the June quarter, but this is still way below the near double-digit growth last seen in 2008.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley suggested on Monday the bank could consider a rate cut, noting slower inflation.
However, Rajan has been focussed on achieving 6 percent inflation by January 2016 and most analysts do not expect a cut when he makes his next policy annoucement on Dec. 2. Rajan has often emphasised that sustained economic growth requires inflation to fall and stay low.
India’s consumer price inflation slowed to 5.52 percent in October on lower food and fuel prices, but is expected to inch up after December as comparisons become less striking.
“Lots of work to do to get India back on a strong growth path. The government has been putting together a series of reforms which I think cumulatively amount to big reforms. The central bank is putting together reforms. My sense is we will do what it takes,” Rajan said.

Hydrogen cars lack fuelling stationsIndia’s Hero to harness Tiger Woods
Development is slow with just 11 new stations added across the globe in 2013, bringing the total number of outlets to 186 as of March 2014 – the majority of them dedicated field testing facilities.
Makers of electric vehicles face the same “chicken-and-egg” dilemma, which is a huge source of frustration to supporters of green vehicle technology. If more people bought cars that used alternative fuel, then more filling stations would open to serve them and economies of scale would help drive down the costs of the vehicles.
Denmark became the first country to lay claim to establishing a national network with plans to add four new hydrogen filling stations this year to its existing two outlets. Six filling stations are enough to provide national coverage, based on a range of 500km between refills.
The furthest a driver would need to go before reaching a filling station in Denmark with the six stations open is 370km, according to the organisation behind the rollout, Copenhagen Hydrogen Network, a joint venture between Air Liquide , the gas supplier, and H2 Logic, a manufacturer of hydrogen filling stations.
Germany, Japan and the US state of California are also leading the way in looking to expand their filling station networks. In Germany, a partnership of six companies – Air Liquide, Daimler , Linde , ÖMV , Shell and Total – set out plans last year to expand the network of hydrogen filling stations from 15 to 400 by 2023. Thomas Weber, head of research at Mercedes-Benz cars, said that if that target were hit by 2023, it would mean hydrogen filling stations would outnumber conventional petrol stations along the German autobahn (motorway) network.
In Japan, the target is to build 100 hydrogen filling stations alongside the main roads connecting four of its biggest cities – Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka – by the end of next year.
California’s state’s energy commission announced it was investing nearly $50m to help accelerate a rollout of hydrogen filling stations, adding 28 outlets to the existing 9 and further 17 in the pipeline. The target is to build a 100-station network, which the authorities deem to be the minimum size necessary “to support the full commercialisation” of hydrogen cell technology in the state.
Toyota said on Tuesday that it would partner with Air Liquide to set up an initial network of 12 filling stations across the northeast of the US.

Soccer legend Pele s son arrested in money laundering caseThe son of soccer legend Pele has been arrested in Brazil after losing an appeal in a money laundering case.
By: Associated Press | Sao Paulo | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:16 am
The 44-year-old son of soccer legend Pele has been arrested in Brazil after losing an appeal in a money laundering case involving a drug gang.
Edson Cholbi do Nascimento, known as Edinho, was convicted earlier this year and sentenced to 33 years in prison for laundering money for the gang.
The former goalkeeper had been allowed to remain free during the process, but a judge on Tuesday said his appeal was rejected.
Edinho can appeal again to a higher court, but judge Suzana Pereira said in her ruling that this time he must remain in jail.
Edinho’s lawyers told Brazilian media that they will request Edinho’s immediate release.
Pele’s press office said the former player will not immediately comment on his son’s arrest.

With existing 17 underperforming  Plan Panel tells PM  no need for more world-class airports'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
The airports at Bhopal, Raipur and Indore would have to wait longer to get the ‘world class’ tag as the 17 existing international airports are nowhere near realising projected traffic volumes, the Planning Commission has told the Prime Minister.
In a presentation to Narendra Modi on Wednesday on the achievements vis-a-vis targets for the infrastructure sectors so far, the panel said that adding three more to that list is needless.
“Out of 17 international airports, five have only a small volume of traffic. Airports with adequate traffic potential only will be made into international ones. These three are not being declared as international airports,” according to the presentation made to the Prime Minister.
The aviation ministry had told the Lok Sabha on July 14 that, Bhopal, Raipur and Indore would be developed as world-class airports. So Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad airports only would be developed as major international hubs in future.
Of the airports to be developed through operation, maintenance and development (OMD) model, he commission said Ahmedabad and Jaipur are to be developed through the public private partnership (PPP) mode while Kolkata and Chennai to be developed through management contracts.
“The Request For Qualification (RFQ) will be issued by December 31, 2014,” the planning body told Modi.
Contracts have been awarded for only five of the 50 Tier-II and Tier-III cities targeted by the civil aviation ministry. They are Hubli, Belgaum, Kishangarh, Jharsuguda and Tezu. “The aviation ministry is re-considering the need for other airports in these cities,” the panel told the Prime Minister.
In its presentation the Commission argued that the prices of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is as high as 40 per cent due to high rates of sales tax and value added tax (VAT), which is as high as 29 per cent in some states. “It is therefore proposed that sales tax and VAT on ATF be reduced to 4 per cent when Goods and Services Tax is implemented,” the commission said.
Endorsing the commission’s contention, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapati Raju on Monday said the government has been asking the states to lower taxes as fuel costs are close to 40-45 per cent of an airline’s total operational cost, given that petroleum prices are on the decline globally.

PM Narendra Modi says Fiji is an important partner; announces 75 million dollar creditlinePrint

By: Press Trust of India | Suva | Posted: November 19, 2014 8:59 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 10:14 pm
Seeking stronger engagement with the Pacific Islands, India on Wednesday announced a 75 million of credit for Fiji for a co-generation power plant and upgrading the sugar industry and also a five million USD fund to develop its villages even as the two countries agreed to expand their defence and security cooperation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made these announcements after talks with his Fijian counterpart Frank Bainimarama shortly after his arrival, also announced a visa on arrival for Fijians and assistance projects that included a parliament library and doubling the scholarships and training slots in India for people from this country.
The lines of credit were part of three agreements signed between the two countries in the presence of the two leaders.
Modi arrived here at the crack of dawn on the third and final leg of his 10-day three-nation tour, for a day-long visit, the first by an Indian premier to the country in 33 years after Indira Gandhi in 1981.

The tiny remote pacific Island nation rolled out the red carpet for Modi, who was received by Frank Bainimarama, a former military ruler, at the Suva International airport.
Bainimarama was sworn in as Prime Minister on September 22 after the first parliamentary elections in the pacific nation since he seized power in a coup in 2006.
Modi was accorded a ceremonial guard of honour at the airport after which he attended the traditional ceremony of Welcome at Albert park, close to the Prime Minister’s office and Parliament.
He shook hands with people from the Indian diaspora assembled at the ground as he walked past the enclosures.

“It is a new day and a new beginning in our relations with Fiji,” Modi said in remarks to the media at a joint appearance with Bainimarama at the prime Minister’s office.
“Fiji could serve as a hub for stronger Indian engagement with Pacific islands. I see this visit as an opportunity to renew an old relationship and lay the foundation for a strong partnership in the future,” he added.
Modi also addressed Fijian parliament, the first by a foreign leader, after parliamentary elections, during which he said that India was prepared to work with Fiji to build a “Digital Fiji”.
The Line of Credit included USD 70 million for a co-generation power plant at Rarav sugar mill and USD five million to strengthen and modernise Fiji’s village, small and medium scale industries.
“I regard Fiji as an important partner for India. We have deep and enduring ties of history and culture. Fiji is an influential voice in the Pacific Region and the developing world, and our partner in multilateral institutions,” Modi said at his joint press interaction.

Reciprocating Modi’s sentiments, Bainimarama said the Indian Prime minister’s visit has laid the groundwork for “productive relationship” between the two countries.
“We are proud to have India as a partner in Fiji’s future,” he said, adding that 15 more bilateral agreements are in the works.
Modi touched a chord at all his events starting his speeches with a Fijian greeting “Nissan Vola” and ending them with “Vinaka” (Thank You).
“We will also expand our defence and security cooperation, including assistance in defence training and capacity building. We agreed to identify opportunities to expand our trade and investments and work out a concrete roadmap,” Modi said.
He said that India looks forward to closer engagement in areas like information technology and Space applications.
“I want to offer to convey a special word of gratitude from the people of India for hosting Indian scientists for tracking India’s Mars Mission earlier this year. Together we made history,” the prime minister said.
“We are also prepared to increase cooperation in renewable energy, especially solar and wind energy, and in building capacity to adapt to climate change,” he added.
He also suggested Fijian leaders to invite Bollywood to shoot their films in Fiji to attract more Indian tourists.
“Fiji is a leader in the region and a strong voice in the developing world. Together, we can also work for a future in the region, in which there is an equal place for all nations – big and small, developed and developing – and a climate of peace and tranquility,” he added.

Advanced technologies used to scan pipelines
The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) on Tuesday resumed a hi-tech leak-detection exercise in the city with a team of experts from two private concerns scanning the vintage 600-mm cast iron pipeline ferrying water to the low-lying areas.
On the first day, the team scanned 500m of the pipeline at Bakery Junction using Sahara, a wired technology to detect air traps, leaks and unauthorised tapings. The sensor attached to a wire shoots videos of the pipe’s interiors. The apparatus comprises a small drag chute which uses the flow of water to take the sensor through the pipeline, recording visuals on the way. For scanning one metre, it costs Rs.1,000.
‘Good condition’
The preliminary examination of the visuals captured by Sahara reveals no leaks, but it has detected high concentration of solid particles inside the 500m stretch of the pipeline. The 80-year-old pipeline seemed to be in good condition, a top KWA official told The Hindu. In the coming days, leak detection tests would be conducted along a 12-km stretch covering the Peroorkada, Ambalamukku, Muttada, Mannanthala and Sasthamangalam areas.
Two firms
The KWA has awarded the project to Delhi-based Four ITS Private Ltd., which executes the work through Canada-based Company Pure Technologies and Manila-based Maynilad Water Services Inc, using advanced technologies — Smart Ball and Sahara. Smart Ball is a free-swimming acoustic leak detector capable of detecting very small leaks. The cost of one ball is around Rs.6.5 lakh.
It can be floated without disrupting flow of water and can be retrieved after the inspection.
Earlier uses
The Smart Ball was first used to scan the 1200-mm transmission line from Aruvikkara to Vellayambalam and the Sahara technology was earlier used to detect defects in the 33-inch line from Vellayambalam to Bakery Junction in March 2013.

BCCI moves to stop leaks to Aditya Verma
It is understood that the ruling dispensation suspects two former BCCI presidents who no longer hold a post in their respective state associations have been working as the informers for Verma.

The BCCI is looking at investigating whether any of its member units' representatives have been feeding data to the board's opponents over the course of their prolonged court battle regarding the IPL corruption scandal.
The possible move was discussed in detail on the sidelines of Tuesday's working committee meeting in Chennai. It is understood that the idea was floated by an office-bearer during a dinner on Monday and was discussed threadbare by the time the 25 representatives who attended the meeting dispersed from Chennai.
Aditya Verma, the secretary of the Cricket Association of Bihar, has been at the forefront of the corruption case …
The BCCI regime strongly suspects that some of its members have been passing on confidential documents and information to Aditya Verma, the secretary of Cricket Association of Bihar, whose petition against the BCCI kicked off a lengthy legal fight. It is understood that the ruling dispensation suspects two former BCCI presidents who no longer hold a post in their respective state associations have been working as the informers for Verma.
An internal probe, likely to be headed by secretary Sanjay Patel or treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry, is set to examine if it can find a trace of confidential information having been passed to outsiders. If found guilty, the BCCI will initiate disciplinary proceedings with the offenders.
Verma's petition in the Bombay High Court in June 2013 against BCCI's inaction against Gurunath Meiyappan has led to a fierce court battle. As a result, despite having taken charge as the ICC chairman, N Srinivasan has been sidelined as the BCCI chief.

India-US WTO deal: Behind tough talk  balancing at home'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
By getting the US to agree to a “permanent solution” addressing India’s concerns over farm subsidies and public procurement linked to food security, the government has effectively rebuffed critics who claimed that its rigid stance had left the country isolated at the World Trade Organization (WTO).
But behind this tough exterior posturing — which has seemingly paid off, with the US and India reaching an understanding that the latter’s food security programmes should not be challenged at the WTO “until a permanent solution… has been agreed and adopted” — is also some pragmatic internal rebalancing of policy.
To begin with, the new government has been more conservative in fixing the minimum support price (MSP) for crops. The MSPs for both paddy and wheat this year have been raised by a mere Rs 50 per quintal. The average annual increase during the previous UPA regime’s tenure from 2004-05 to 2013-14 was Rs 76 per quintal for paddy and Rs 77 for wheat.
More radical, however, are two other measures.
The first is a crackdown on the practice of states declaring bonuses over and above the Centre’s MSPs. In 2013-14, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan offered Rs 150 to wheat farmers on top of the MSP of Rs 1,400 per quintal. Similarly, for paddy, Chhattisgarh and Kerala gave bonuses of Rs 300 and 490 respectively in addition to the MSP of Rs 1,310 per quintal.
But in June, the Union food ministry issued a communication that in the event of states paying bonuses to farmers, procurement for the Central pool would be limited only to the extent of the concerned state’s grain requirement for its public distribution system and other welfare schemes.
Any surplus grain that was procured would have to be disposed of by the state government, which would also be required to “bear the financial burden in that regard”.
The directive has resulted in Chhattisgarh — where procurement has jumped six-fold since 2000-01 — capping official paddy purchases in the new 2014-15 marketing season at 10 quintals per acre, as against the earlier average of 15-20 quintals.
The second big reform step has been to limit the levy on rice mills to a maximum of 25 per cent of production. Till last year, states like Andhra Pradesh were fixing this mandatory quota — which mills have to deliver to the Food Corporation of India or state agencies — at as high as 75 per cent. “The three moves — lower MSP increases, restraints on state-level bonuses and limits on levy — will help us reduce procurement and stockholding beyond the required minimum buffer-cum-strategic reserve requirements,” said a food ministry official. As on October 1, total grain stocks in the Central pool were over 49 million tonnes against the necessary 21.2 MT for that date.
While the official refused to quantify, Tejinder Narang, a New Delhi-based independent grains analyst, estimated rice procurement for the Central pool in the current season to be at least 7-8 MT below the 32 MT of 2013-14.
“It appears that this government’s policy on food security is different from its predecessor’s. Earlier, food security was being defined in terms of physical grain delivery, whereas now it could mean targeted income support to both farmers and consumers, which is also WTO-compliant. There will be more reliance, then, on direct benefit transfers than the public grain stockholding route,” he said.
It is another thing, though, that this seemingly unstated policy is different from the language being spoken at the WTO.

Narendra Modi pushes for pact on mutual recognition of qualificationsPrint
Written by Anil Sasi | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:34 am
Two months after it signed a landmark free trade agreement (FTA) in services and investments with the ASEAN, India strongly prodded the 10-nation bloc to wrap up an accompanying pact on the mutual recognition of educational and professional qualifications — an essential prerequisite for India to leverage its competitive advantage in the services sector.
In his address at the 12th India-ASEAN Summit here on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed on this issue and said: “I suggest that we conduct a review of our free trade agreement on goods to improve it further and make it beneficial to all. I also urge that the FTA on Services and Investment be brought into force at the earliest … We should move quickly towards mutual Recognition of Degrees”.
The reluctance of ASEAN members to ratify the mutual recognition of degrees pact stems from continuing apprehension on the impact that this could have on their own services sectors.
The Philippines, which is yet to ratify the overarching services agreement, had earlier raised concerns that opening up of the region’s services sector may have an “adverse impact” on its own services industry, given India’s strength in the sector.
India had signed the FTA in services and investments with the ASEAN on September 9, 2014, two years after the discussions on the pact concluded.
The benefits for India from the agreement — which was expected to pave the way for India to leverage its competitive offerings in finance, education, health, IT, telecommunications, transport, movement of professionals and enabling Indian service providers to offer services to ASEAN customers with greater ease than what is possible currently — is unlikely to fructify in the absence of the mutual recognition agreements that essentially honours the educational and professional qualifications across India and the ASEAN.
This is a problem that India already faces in case of similar FTAs in services that it has in place with Japan and South Korea.
The services pact — unarguably India’s strong point — with ASEAN was the first that India had signed with another trading country/bloc after the NDA government assumed office in May.
The delay in signing mutual recognition agreements stems from the opposition by some ASEAN countries to free movement of professionals, given rising unemployment in their countries.
As a result, some of these countries are insisting that Indian professionals should obtain local qualifications; for instance, a doctor wanting to practice in Thailand must obtain a licence from Medical Council of Thailand.
Except for the Philippines, every other ASEAN member — Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia — has ratified the service deal.
India had implemented the FTA in goods with ASEAN members in 2010, while it had concluded the negotiations for FTA in services and investments in 2012.
With the signing of the pact in services and investments, the FTA is stated to become a comprehensive economic partnership between the two sides, but for the hassle of the mutual recognition agreements.
The UPA-II government had come under criticism for signing free trade agreements “in haste” and losing out on continued…

G20 Day Zero: Prime Minister Narendra Modi to meet Cameron  dine with AbePrint
Written by P Vaidyanathan Iyer | Brisbane | Posted: November 14, 2014 1:40 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make the most of a public holiday declared by Brisbane on Friday and meet at least two global leaders — David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, during the day at the summit venue and Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, over dinner, a day ahead of the Group of 20 (G20) summit on November 15-16. He will simultaneously kick off the India-Australia bilateral with a visit to the Queensland University of Technology in the forenoon.
Modi arrives in Brisbane straight from Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar where he was present for the ASEAN and East Asia Summit. The Prime Minister’s visit to Australia for the two-day G20 Summit will mark his debut presence at a big ticket multilateral fora and will be followed by bilateral talks with Premier Tony Abbott in Canberra.
His Australia visit has a strong business and commerce agenda, but the Prime Minister will showcase several other facets of relationship including education and skills, culture and tourism, and defence.
“An Indian Prime Minister is visiting Australia after 28 years. The agenda is balanced, and comprehensive,” an Australian government official said, not willing to be quoted.
“In Brisbane, he will meet business persons, including those from the resources sector, and in Melbourne leading Australian CEOs,” another local government official, liasioning with the Indian delegation said. Modi is keen to get a larger pie of institutional investment from Australia. “Australia is the third largest institutional invest or with resources of $3 trillion-plus,” the official added.
At the G20 meeting, Modi is expected to make a strong pitch for growth accompanied with creation of jobs, infrastructure funding for developing countries, resolution of taxation in the specific context of BEPS (base erosion and profit sharing), larger voice in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and India’s own commitment to contribute significantly to the additional 2 per cent growth that global leaders are seeking.
Modi’s statements in such a multilateral fora will also assume significance since the purview of G20, whose members account for almost 85 per cent of global output, has gradually expanded over the last six years. From just fighting the global economic crisis of 2008, it has over the last six years progressed to include world trade, climate change and energy.
Ahead of the summit, India and the US also achieved a breakthrough in the WTO talks, with New Delhi finally agreeing to be party to the Trade Facilitation Agreement.
An Indian Prime Minister will visit this continent after almost three decades, and Modi hopes to unravel various dimension of India’s relationship with the Down Under. Similar to his visit to the United States, Modi will reach out to the 4,50,000-strong Indian diaspora in Australia. At the policy level, he will demand for a sharp cut in the costs of remittances for NRIs who send money back to India.
The Indian diaspora has gone the extra mile to recreate New York’s Madison Square event in Australia too. He will address people of Indian origin in Sydney’s Melbourne Cricket Ground, continued…

Inflation falls to 5-year low of 1.77 pct in OctoberThe Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation was at 2.38 per cent in September and 7.24 per cent in October 2013. (Reuters)
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:31 pm
Continuing decline in food prices, including vegetables, pulled wholesale price inflation to a five year low of 1.77 per cent in October.
The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation was at 2.38 per cent in September and 7.24 per cent in October 2013.
As per data released by the government today, the food inflation fell to a nearly two-and-half year low of 2.7 per cent. Food inflation is on decline since May.
The sharp drop in WPI inflation, which fell for the fifth month in a row, came at the back of retail inflation declining to a record low of 5.52 per cent in October.
“The WPI data released today indicate considerable softening in prices, which comes as a great relief. Equally important is to note the decline in CPI inflation rate reported earlier this week. A drop in prices was noted across all major segments indicating significant easing in inflationary pressures”, said Dr A Didar Singh, Secretary General, FICCI.
“The inflationary expectations are fairly tamed and we see no immediate upside risks with regard to prices. Given that, it is important to reiterate that demand remains subdued. The consumer durables segment reported negative growth for the fourth consecutive month in September 2014. It is extremely imperative that all levers are used to pep up demand”, added Singh.
“The government is committed towards achieving fiscal consolidation and this along with alleviated inflation creates room for a more accommodative stance from the Central Bank in terms of rate reduction in the policy to be announced next month”, pointed Dr. Singh.
The rate of price rise in onion contracted 59.77 per cent as compared to a contraction of 58.12 per cent in September.
In case of vegetables, the contraction was 19.61 per cent, while in protein rich items of egg, meat and fish it was 2.58 per cent in October.
During the month, inflation in potato stood at 82.11 per cent, against 90.23 per cent in the previous month.
Inflation in manufactured products, like sugar, edible oils, beverages and cement, fell to 2.43 per cent in October as against 2.84 per cent in the previous month.
The August WPI inflation was revised higher to 3.85 per cent from 3.74 per cent earlier, the data said.
Inflation in the fuel and power segment which include LPG, petrol and diesel declined to 0.43 per cent as compared to price rise of 1.33 per cent in September.
The Reserve Bank which maintained status quo in interest rate since January, will come out with the monetary policy review on December 2. The RBI factors in retail inflation while formulating its monetary policy.
The decline in both retail and WPI inflation for October, coupled with improvement in industrial output for September, will put pressure on the RBI continued…

Indias GDP to grow at 6.3 per cent in 2015: Morgan StanleyBy: Press Trust of India | Singapore | Posted: November 14, 2014 2:37 pm
India would have the fastest economic expansion among Asian countries and its gross domestic product is expected to grow by 6.3 per cent in 2015, according to Morgan Stanley forecasts of global economies.
The Indian rupee’s exchange rate to USD would be at Rs 62.2 by end of next year compared to Rs 62 in the current quarter (Q4 this year), according to a presentation made at the Morgan Stanley’s Annual Asia Pacific Summit held here from November 12-14 said.
It is seen at Rs 62.5 in the first two quarters of next year and Rs 62.3 in the third quarter of next year.
Comparative to other Asian GDP growths, India would have the fastest economic expansion, it said.
India’s gross domestic product is expected to grow by 6.3 per cent in 2015, up from 5.3 this year, it said.
“We are constructive on the INR from the outlook perspective,” Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley’s Chief Asia Economist, told PTI.
Strong capital inflow and the current account deficit under-two per cent would add upward pressure on the Rupee. Reforms are providing confidence in the Indian economy growth.
The Indian government’s policy action to improve business environment and lower oil prices are among the factors supporting the GDP growth, Ahya said.
Structural reforms related to land, labour and tax supporting the economic growth would support economic growths in the coming years. The risk would be any disruption to execution and delivery of reforms as well as a slowdown in exports, he pointed out.
On imports, the lower oil prices have been helpful and supporting the economic growth. Oil imports were down at 4 per cent of the GDP now from 6 per cent in 2012.
“It is obviously helping the recovery process,” Ahya said.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley has forecasted a sub-par global growth at 3.5 per cent in 2015, up nominally from 3.1 per cent this year. In Asia, China’s GDP is forecasted to contract to 7.1 per cent in 2015 from 7.3 per cent in 2014.
Asian GDP, excluding Japan’s, would grow to 6.3 per cent in 2015, up by a small proportion from 6 per cent this year. Japan’s GDP growth would be stagnant at 0.8 per cent in 2014 and 2015.
Some 1,700 delegates including representatives of 300 global corporations are attending the summit.

Under attack DERC withdraws power tariff hike in Delhi within 24 hrs'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
Facing severe attack from political parties, Delhi’s power regulator DERC today withdrew the power tariff hike of up to seven per cent which was announced last night.
The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission said the hike was rolled back “realising” that a number of power generation companies including NTPC, which supply electricity to the city, provided only part information about price of fuel such as coal and gas.
The DERC last night had announced re-introduction of the power purchase adjustment cost (PPAC) surcharge to effect an increase of tariff by up to seven per cent from Saturday.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress and Aam Aadmi Party had slammed DERC for raising the tariff, demanding an immediate roll back, but DERC today claimed that the decision to withdraw the hike was not due to criticism from the parties.
DERC chairperson P D Sudhakar said additional information on cost of producing of power from coal and gas-based power generating stations has been sought and a fresh decision on tariff will be taken within two weeks after examining the details.
“It has now been brought to the notice of the Commission that various generators including NTPC supplying power to Delhi have provided only part of the information regarding pricing of fuel and billing of power generated at their stations.
“Additional information has been called for, which is expected shortly which will have a direct bearing on the PPAC claims (by the discoms),” Sudhakar said.
Asked why the additional information on pricing of fuel and cost of power production was not sought earlier, he said the DERC had increased the tariff provisionally and now it felt that the detail costing of the generating stations should have been analysed before hiking the rates.
“We will take a decision on PPAC within next two weeks,” said Sudhakar while claiming that decision was not revoked due to criticism from political parties.
Last night, the DERC had hiked the tariff by 7 per cent for consumers of BSES Yamuna Power and was fixed at 4.5 per cent for BSES Rajdhani.
The hike for consumers of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd was 2.5 per cent.
Asked about the issue, Lt Governor Najeeb Jung only said the hike has been withdrawn.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5 per cent for domestic consumers, the DERC in July had withdrawn Power Purchase Adjustment Cost (PPAC) of around 8 per cent till October.
The regulator had introduced PPAC in 2012 to help the private power distribution companies recover additional cost on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
Delhi gets power from a number of gas and coal-based power generation plants.
The private power distribution companies, particularly, BRPL and BYPL, have been demanding significant hike in tariff, citing rise in power purchase cost.
The withdrawal of PPAC in July had resulted in marginal decline of tariff for the consumers, whose monthly consumption does not exceed 400 units.
According to DERC figures, the private discoms operating in the city have a revenue gap of a whopping Rs 19,500 crore.
Official figures show that around 80-90 per cent of total revenue of discoms goes into purchasing power from central and state government owned entities through long-term power purchase agreement, at rates determined by the central and state regulators.
The city has seen a series of hike in power tariff in the past two years.
The tariff was hiked by 22 per cent in 2011 followed by five per cent hike in February 2012. The tariff was increased by up to two per cent in May 2012 year and again by 26 per cent for domestic consumers in July 2012.
It was hiked by up to three per cent in February last year and again by five per cent in August last.
The cost of buying power has increased primarily on account of an increase in the input prices of raw material like coal and gas, officials said.

Robot and agriculture lessons: Modi returns to campus in BrisbanePrint
Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Australia.
Written by P Vaidyanathan Iyer | Brisbane | Posted: November 14, 2014 11:40 am | Updated: November 15, 2014 1:01 am
Within hours of landing in Brisbane for the two-day Group of 20 Leaders Summit starting Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepped out to the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), to interact with scientists in agriculture and bio sciences.
“The Prime Minister was given a demonstration of specific scientific projects, some of which are jointly funded by Australia and India,” said Prof Arun Sharma, Deputy Vice Chancellor (Research and Commercialisation), QUT.
After a presentation on AgBot, a special robot that has agricultural applications, Modi wrote on it that research is the mother of development and intrinsically linked to the development journey of mankind. He also spoke to students and said he was fortunate to meet them on the 125th birth anniversary of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Modi interacted with QUT academicians to know more about India-Australia joint projects such as bio fortification of banana, integrated bio fuel project and robotics in agriculture. Congratulating the scientists at QUT, he said, “Agriculture will benefit from the use of science and technology.”
 
 
Prof Sharma said Queensland has a very special relationship with Modi. “Queensland was one of the first jurisdictions in the world to send an invitation to Mr Modi when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2012. There is a quite a lot of investment coming from Gujarat,” he pointed out.
The research on nutritional enrichment of bananas with iron is funded by the Australian government, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the department of biotechnology, India.
“He also saw our research in pulses, and how we covert waste material from agriculture or sugar waste into plastics, chemicals and bio fuel to create more value added industrial products. This is so relevant to India which is also looking at adding more rural jobs,” Deputy V-C Sharma said after the PM’s visit.
According to Prof Sharma, who is a computer science undergraduate from BITS Pilani, and a Ph.D from the State University of New York, “There is a new sense of energy, vibrancy in India. And I think, Australia is aware of it. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in India and signed the uranium deal and also extended the Australia-India strategic research fund collaboration project.”
The two countries have much to offer to each other, he said. “We are in some sense complementary. India has know how and manpower. Australia has natural resources and expertise in infrastructure. It is not just resources. We have similar climatic zones.
The way we do agriculture and even build infrastructure is similar. We have a lot more to collaborate,” he added.
In Brisbane, where Modi arrived a little later than schedule, he was received by Queensland Premier Campbell Newman. The Prime Minister and his delegation are staying at the Sofitel Hotel in the central business district. “Reached Brisbane. It is bright and sunny outside,” Modi tweeted upon his arrival.
This is the first visit by an continued…

Microsoft surpasses Exxon as 2nd most valuable companyUnder Satya Nadella, Microsoft has worked to overcome its reputation as a clumsy behemoth struggling to keep up with new tech trends and consumer habits. (Reuters)
By: Associated Press | San Francisco | Posted: November 15, 2014 12:13 pm
The bull run in Microsoft’s stock this past year has helped the tech giant surpass Exxon Mobil and seize the rank of the second most valuable company, behind Apple Inc.
Under new CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has worked to overcome its reputation as a clumsy behemoth struggling to keep up with new tech trends and consumer habits. Nadella has cut expenses – and jobs – while pledging to refocus the company on mobile technology and cloud computing. His efforts have fueled a stock surge that drove Microsoft’s total market value above $410 billion on Friday. That leapfrogged Exxon’s value of $404 billion, which has been dinged by the drop in oil prices.
”Microsoft has made a strategic change,” said Daniel Ives, a tech analyst at FBR Capital Markets. He said Nadella still faces challenges with a company that’s heavily reliant on the declining personal computer market. But compared with other longtime tech stalwarts, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle, ”Microsoft has done the best job of trying to skate where the puck is going,” Ives said.
Apple Inc  is currently the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalization of more than $668 billion. That’s more than the $616 billion that Microsoft was worth when it was No. 1 in December 1999. Microsoft shares fell sharply the next year.
But the Redmond, Washington company has earned greater cachet on Wall Street over the last 18 months. Its stock has risen nearly 70 percent since April 2013, when activist investment firm ValueAct Capital announced it had taken a $2 billion stake in the company and would scrutinize its strategy. Within a few months, longtime CEO Steve Ballmer announced plans to retire. The move was described as unrelated.
Since then, Nadella has announced new initiatives to expand in cloud computing, which promises to be more lucrative than the traditional model of selling software that is installed on clients’ computers. Microsoft has also promised a redesign of its flagship Windows operating system and released versions of other popular software for smartphones and tablets, including devices made by competitor Apple.
Microsoft shares have outperformed the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite Index, which gained about 45 percent in the same 18-month period. The stock hit $50.04 on Friday, its highest point since early 2000, before slipping to the $49.50 range in afternoon trading.

Currency  wage and tech edge drive auto part exports to China 
 
“This is due to a strengthening renminbi and a depreciating rupee, and the rising cost of manufacturing in China due to higher wage inflation than in India,” Sikka said, adding that Indian suppliers have controlled their costs and made quality improvements in their supplies over the last few years.
Abhimanyu Saraf, director at the R2,000-crore Vikas Group, which has nine auto component subsidiaries, told FE that India’s edge is in forgings and products that are dependent on local design inputs. “We export engine parts like catalytic converters and connecting rods to China, and the export value has already grown to R20 crore this year from R5 crore last year. Next year we are targeting R50 crore,” he said.
Added Sunil Arora, MD at Abilities India Pistons & Rings, “We started exporting to global players in China about six to seven years back when they noticed that though the prices were lower from local vendors, the quality was inconsistent. We are growing 10-15% now with R10 crore worth of exports to China out of a total of R35 crore.”
India’s auto components industry had been making strong inroads into the European and US markets for some years now, but several new factors have now helped the industry make a strong break into China. Between January 2012 and today, the renminbi has strengthened versus the dollar by almost 3%, while the cost of power in both countries is now largely the same — even though India still has problems of irregular supply.

Reliance Ent plans to acquire Western game studios in 2015Reliance Entertainment, which is biggest stakeholder in DreamWorks Animation Studios, is in talks to acquire up-and-coming mobile game studios in North America, Europe. (Reuters)
By: Reuters | Mumbai | Posted: November 15, 2014 4:44 pm
Reliance Entertainment plans to begin acquiring North American and European mobile game studios starting in early 2015, in hopes of becoming a significant global player in the fast-growing mobile games industry.
The company, which is the biggest stakeholder in DreamWorks Animation Studios, is in talks with bankers to identify and acquire up-and-coming mobile game studios in North America and Europe to boost sales, Chief Executive Manish Agarwal told Reuters in a phone interview.
“We will go full steam in the January and February time frame in terms of identifying studios,” Agarwal said. “Gaming is going to be the largest share of the pie of entertainment time spent, and Reliance would like to be a sizeable player in that space.”
Reliance Entertainment is a unit of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani, one of India’s largest conglomerates, with businesses ranging from financial services to infrastructure and power. Its Reliance Games unit is looking at smaller studios at $2 million to $5 million a pop, at least initially, according to Agarwal.
Agarwal said the potential for Reliance Games is “huge.”
“In three years, our business will make $50 million in net revenue, and in five years we’ll be a $100 million company,” he said. Net revenue is after cuts taken by app stores from Google, Apple and others.
Reliance Games, which to date has focused on making titles related to Hollywood properties in partnership with studios such as Warner Bros, Sony and Lions Gate, hopes to use acquisitions to expand into other genres, Agarwal said. Genres of interest include real-time action strategy akin to Supercell’s “Clash of Clans,” puzzlers like King’s  “Candy Crush Saga,” builder games like Supercell’s “Boom Beach,” and social casino games.
Reliance Games develops its own titles at its Pune-based studio in India as well as partnering with other game studios. With about 50 million downloads, its most successful game franchise has been “Real Steel,” with action titles based on the DreamWorks movie with the same name featuring Hugh Jackman.
In the face of competition from larger and more seasoned players such as King and Japan’s GungHo Online Entertainment , Reliance has yet to make waves in a competitive mobile gaming space that investors worry is a fickle, hit-driven business.
Agarwal, who did not identify targets, made it clear that Reliance does not want studios that could be one-hit wonders, such as OMGPOP, which was acquired by Zynga for $200 million but shut down over a year later.
Reliance Games wants nimble studios of five to 12 members and that are “one game away from creating that elusive hit and looking to scale,” Agarwal said. “If the game is already doing good, the shelf life of the game could be six to 12 continued…

Four easy steps for men to enhance their looksFour Steps to Good Looks
Here are the four easy ways by which men can have flawless and healthy skin
   Edition: Oct 26, 2014
Get deeper and down Start by applying a cleanser after a lengthy steam bath, which helps open your pores. Hold a hot towel to your face for a minute to get the steaming effect. Then apply a cleanser.
Scratch the surface Exfoliation removes the top layer of the skin and unblocks your pores, translating into fewer spots and ingrown hair. A high-street scrub will remove dead skin cells. Use it twice a week for smooth skin.
Just add water Men usually don't moisturise enough for facials to deliver the results you'd expect. Apply moisturiser by making long strokes from the inside of your face out. This relaxes your skin, so it's more receptive to hydration
Leave the bags at the door A massage of the eye area reduces any excess fluid, so eyes look less puffy. Cooling the skin also helps get rid of dark circles. The solution, you say? Cooling gels are hydrating, and their cold rollerball help reduce redness.
 

Stocks take a breather after BSE Sensex hits lifetime highThe BSE index finally settled at at 28,163.29, down 14.59 points, or 0.05 per cent -- snapping a two-day upmove. (Reuters)

Indian stocks edged lower today as investors took a breather after benchmark Sensex hit lifetime high of 28,282.85 and closed with a loss of 14.59 points on profit-booking in IT, realty and oil & gas shares.
Surpassing all previous records, the 30-share BSE barometer resumed higher and rallied to scale a new peak but emergence of profit-booking in recent out-performers at record levels wiped off early gains.
The BSE index finally settled at at 28,163.29, down 14.59 points, or 0.05 per cent — snapping a two-day upmove. Intra-day, it had touched a low of 28119.95.
The gauge’s previous intra-day life high of 28,205.71 and record close of 28,177.88 was logged yesterday. The Sensex had garnered 237.24 points in the previous two sessions.
Likewise, the NSE Nifty after hitting all-time high of 8,454.50, beating previous record of 8,438.10 (intra-day), fell back to close 4.85 points, or 0.06 per cent, down at 8,425.90. Yesterday, it had closed at its record high of 8,430.75.
“Profit booking at current levels and mixed expectations about probable curbs on gold import kept the stocks markets volatile throughout the day,” said Hiren Dhakan, Associate Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 656.37 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from stock exchanges.
IT, realty, consumer durables, oil & gas, FMCG and healthcare stocks attracted profit-booking, while capital goods, power, metal, auto, banking and PSU shares recorded further gains.
In the 30-share Sensex, 16 stocks declined while 14 rose.
Stocks of HDFC fell 1.90 per cent on concerns the mortgage lender will have to shed some of its holdings in HDFC Bank after FIPB classified the parent’s holdings in the banking arm as foreign investment.
Other Sensex laggards include Sun Pharma (1.94 per cent), Hindalco ( 1.61 per cent), ONGC (1.49 per cent), TCS (1.18 per cent), Cipla (0.81 per cent) and Infosys (0.76 per cent).
In broader markets, sugar company stocks like Shree Renuka Sugar, Balrampur Chini and Dhampur Sugar hogged the limelight on expectations of export subsidy announcement.

India had first entered the trillion-dollar club in June 2007, but moved out in September 2008 after a global meltdown. It again got back into the elite league in May 2009 and largely remained there except for some brief time, including once in 2012. In August 2013, it again moved out of the list.

arrest
Khaleed alias Mohammed Khalid arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with Bardhaman blast case was staying in a rented house at Royal Colony in Balapur under Pahadishareef police station limits along with his family members for the last one year.
It is learnt that, the family comprising his mother, two sisters, younger brother, wife and his daughter crossed over to India through Bangladesh in November last and came to Hyderabad after visiting the UNHRC office in Delhi.
Khalid, a native of Mongdu town in Myanmar got married two years ago, and has a daughter. He used to work as a teacher at a local madrasa in Myanmar before crossing over to India. His father, Kareemullah working in Saudi Arabia for the last 11 years has not visited the family after they shifted to Hyderabad.
According to locals, a police team picked him from his house in the early hours of Saturday. An NIA team visited the house again on Monday night along with Khalid and searched the premises and seized his laptop and other belongings. It is learnt that Khalid, who was working at a private school in Hafeezbabanagar for the last few months, also used a laptop at his hometown but did not carry it along at the time of entering the country.
While Khalid worked as a teacher, his siblings were studying in different schools in the area. The family said that Kareemullah sent them money to meet their expenses. The family also applied for a refugee card from the UNHCR through a voluntary organisation and Khalid got a voter identity card also.
‘Khalid innocent’
The family members of Khalid claimed that their son was innocent and was in no way connected with terrorist activities. “My son is a peace-loving person. He was never called by the police at any point of time in Myanmar or Hyderabad,” Khalid’s mother Hameeda Hanam said. She said her son was teaching Arabic and English at a school in Hafeezbabanagar. “My son is pious and is regular to the prayers. In Myanmar, we were facing threat and persecution and so we took refuge in India,” she said.
Neighbours described Khalid as a soft-spoken person and was not inclined to believe he had any terror links.

Economic slowdown delays Railways factory projectsEconomic slowdown delays Railways’ factory projects
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, November 18:  
The Railway Ministry has announced many plans of setting up factories through joint ventures or public-private partnerships (PPPs) over the past few years. However, none of these has fructified because of lower-than-expected growth, according to a Railway Board official.
“We are not in that growth path anymore. That has put brakes on PPP programme initiated earlier,” K Swaminathan, Advisor-Mechanical (Projects), Railway Board, said at a CII event here on Tuesday.
He, however, added that the Railways hoped to arrive at a common ground for the way forward and was trying to evolve a path acceptable to both the private and Government sectors.
Offtake plan
The earlier rolling stock procurement plans by the Railways suggested an assured offtake plan for 8-10 years. This led to differing opinions within the Railways on whether it should be entering such long-term commitments, given that there may not be requisite demand. The last Railways’ long-term ‘Vision 2020’ projections were in 2009, when the country was experiencing higher growth rates of about 8-9 per cent.
Swaminathan said that when the Railway Ministry tried to start factories with procurement assurances for three years, there were no takers. The Railways has now initiated plans to set up factories in many places, including Madhepura, Marhowra, Palakkad and Kachrapara.
Assured returns
Earlier, referring to the new private participation and foreign direct investment guidelines, MS Mathur, Executive Director-PPP, Railway Board, said that traffic guarantees or assured revenue returns were being provided in some of the models for its PPP projects.
He said as regards the foreign direct investment guidelines, the Railways envisaged permitting operations under some conditions, which reflects a sharp deviation from its earlier stance.

Report aims to ensure transparency and reduce delays
New Delhi, November 18:  
A committed headed by former Cabinet Secretary TSR Subramanian, set up to review environmental laws, has submitted its report to Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar.
The committee’s report takes ahead the Government’s move to amend five key green laws to ensure transparency in clearances along with protecting the environment. Receiving the report, Javadekar said it would help the Ministry avoid “undue delays and ensure transparency in clearances and implementation of projects.”
Subramanian said the committee had built on the existing mechanisms to optimise efforts “to balance developmental imperatives causing least possible damage to environment”.
Environmentalists cry foul
He said the committee had had wide-ranging consultations with stakeholders and formulated action points to streamline the Ministry’s efforts to strengthen institutions and processes. Incidentally, green activists had protested the absence of any environmental expert in the panel, fearing “complete dismantling” of laws and institutions related to environmental governance.
Himanshu Thakkar of South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, questioned the process of submissions to the committee “in less than 1,000 characters”. In a blog, Thakkar said the “whole process limits participation to English speaking and writing people who have access to the internet, leaving a vast majority out of the review process”.
The expert panel was assigned to review the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

Call for easing port tariff normsCall for easing port tariff norms
Our Bureau
NN Kumar, Chairman of JN Port Trust
New Delhi, November 18:  
Denmark sees vast scope for cooperation with the shipping sector here, but wants ports in India to ease tariff norms. Addressing an FICCI event on ports and shipping here, Freddy Svanne, Ambassador of Denmark to India, said there was a need for tariff regulations to be relaxed in the port sector. He said he had spent five years talking to the Planning Commission and various arms of the Government but had not found any action.
Airing similar views, NN Kumar, Chairman of JN Port, also called for relaxation of tariff regulation norms, pointing out that tariffs of non-major ports are not regulated but those of major ports are. Kumar also called for a clause that permits revisiting the contract between ports and port developers. The risk of environment clearance has to be borne by Government bodies, such as the Port Trust and not the private investors, he said.
Earlier, Svanne had said there was a scope for cooperation in the areas of ship design, port development and logistics.
Shipping is one of the biggest areas of trade between Denmark and India. Danish shipping serves India with all important market segments and several Danish shipping companies have opened offices in India, such as the Maersk Group India, which includes business units of Damco, Maersk training, Safmarine, Svitzar, and APM Terminals. The group employs 12,740 people in India and recruits 150-200 cadets annually.

Freight services deserve priority  overhaulFreight services deserve priority, overhaul
NK Kurup
Tweet
November 18, 2014:  
By roping in Sreedharan to recommend a transparent decision-making mechanism for Railways, Minister Suresh Prabhu has sent out a strong message that the days of those seeking comfort in the opaque system are over. There is no better choice than the Metroman with an impeccable record of executing railway projects, to do the job.
Though, it may not be easy for Prabhu to bring about rapid changes to a system fraught with inherent inefficiencies, putting in place a mechanism that makes people accountable for what they do or fail to do will certainly pave the way for sound and fast decision-making.
Overhaul needed
No doubt, the country’s transport behemoth badly needs an overhaul in its administrative and operating system, but equally important is to have a re-look at the relative priority being given to passenger and freight services.
While safety and comfort should receive top priority, freight services that subsidise the passenger fares need enhanced attention. It will not only improve the Railways’ revenues but also enable it to make more contributions to the logistics sector.
It is estimated that logistics inefficiencies reduce GDP growth by more than one per cent. The railways has the potential to reduce such avoidable losses. Unfortunately, Railways ministers seldom focus on freight services, as unlike passenger services, the former rarely adds mileage to their popularity. If Prabhu can change the tradition, he would be doing a great service to the logistics sector.
Incorrect mix
It is known that for long-distance freight movement, rail is more economical and environment-friendly than road. However, in India, railways accounts for only 30 per cent of the domestic freight movement while road has the lion’s share of 60 per cent.
For a healthy logistics system, this mix is not a comfortable one. What is worrisome is that the railways continues to lose cargo to roads.
Though efforts have been made to improve the goods services, they are still plagued by the tardiness. Currently the railways carry more of bulk cargoes. For instance, coal accounts for about 40 per cent of the total freight. Foodgrains, another major item, enjoy subsidised freight rates.
If there is a 5-10 per cent variation in demand for wagons either way, the railways will not be able to cope up. Either there will be shortage of wagons or too many wagons will idle. Another problem is limited line capacity – passenger trains are always given priority. To overcome this, dedicated freight corridors were started. But when they will become operational is anybody’s guess.
Container service: this is an area that needs active attention. Private operators who came in with a lot of enthusiasm now seem disappointed. Though the volume may not be large, the movement of general cargo in containers will be the future trend.
Unless issues such as high haulage charges, access to railway terminals and restrictions on movement of certain commodities in containers are sorted out, some of them will be forced to wind up operations.
Changes sought
It is time to have a fresh look at the freight services. To begin with, a detailed study is important in view of the emerging trends such as growth of e-commerce, third party logistics, increased containerisation in domestic goods, and the Government thrust on development of the infrastructure sector.
The Railways should also set a target to increase its share in the domestic freight to 40 per cent in the next 5-7 years. For this, it needs to enter multimodal transport service in a logical tie-up with road and coastal shipping operators.
One can reasonably expect Suresh Prabhu, who has had a commendable track record as Power Minister in the Vajpayee Government, to excel in his performance in the Railways.

DoT plans two-phase spectrum auctions between Feb and MayDoT plans two-phase spectrum auctions between Feb and May
Thomas K Thomas
Says this will address Govt’s fiscal needs and operator concerns; telecom firms unhappy
New Delhi, November 18:  
In an attempt to strike a balance between the need to put more airwaves up for sale and meet revenue targets for this fiscal year, the Department of Telecom wants to conduct spectrum auctions in two phases, between February and May next year.
The DoT is keen on holding one round of auctions on February 25, before the end of this fiscal year, and another on May 30, when additional frequency bands are expected to be vacated by the Defence forces.
While the auctions in February will adhere to the earlier schedule with spectrum in the 900 MHz, 800 MHz and the 1800 MHz bands, the one in May is for airwaves in the 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz bands. This proposal was presented by the DoT to the Minister of IT & Communications at a closed door meeting on November 12.
According to DoT officials, the plan takes into consideration the concerns raised by telecom operators. “The two-stage auction will allow those telecom firms that lose out in the February auction to have another opportunity to buy spectrum in May,” said a senior DoT official.
Under the earlier plan, the DoT had proposed to sell spectrum only in the 1800 MHz and 900 MHz bands, in February. However, telecom operators and the regulator had cautioned that auctioning spectrum without additional frequency bands would be disastrous. Consequently, the DoT is now looking at another round of auctions.
Operators unhappy
However, telecom operators say that even the new plan will not work. Rajan Mathews, Director General, Cellular Operators Association of India, said that selling spectrum in different phases will result in huge uncertainties.
“While auctioning additional spectrum is a good step, we want all of it to be sold simultaneously,” Mathews said. “Either the Government should act quickly and put all bands on sale in February if they are so keen on meeting Budget targets or they can extend the licence tenure of incumbent players and hold auctions in May.”
The operators feel that the DoT’s logic is flawed because the 2100 MHz band is not a substitute for existing GSM players. “Selling spectrum in the 2100 MHz and 2500 MHz bands is not a fallback option for an existing player but bringing these additional frequencies will ease the demand for 900 MHz by players who do not have 3G spectrum,” said a Mumbai-based operator.
The operators say that it is important to sell all spectrum in one go to reduce pressure on the 900 MHz band. But for that to happen, the Telecom Ministry will have to quickly get the Defence Ministry to vacate spectrum early.

Introduces supernumerary seats to induct foreign students for PGP courses 
Ahmedabad, Nov 18:  
In order to induct more management students from overaseas, the Indian Institute of Management - Ahmedabad (IIM-A) on Tuesday, announced the supernumerary seats for foreign nationals, who wish to take up IIM's PGP courses on the campus.
 
Announcing the decision, Ashish Nanda, Director, IIM-A said, "The seats offered to the foreign students will be over and above the current capacity of the foreign students. The step is aimed at bringing diversity in foreign students."
 
IIM-A has 431 seats for PGP and PGP-ABM courses, while supernumerary seats will be about 10 per cent of the existing seats.
 
Also, the institute has decided to change the curriculum of its flagship current post graduate programme (PGP), and PGP-Agribusiness Management (PGP-ABM) programmes. The institute has inducted a feature of food processing business in its ABM programme, which would now equip students to take up career in food processing sector as well.
 
"We are also opening up our ABM programme for students of non-agriculture background. This way the intake of students will become more diverse in terms of academic background," said Vijay Paul Sharma, chairman - PGP-ABM.
 
The institute has also introduced two new courses - 'agricultural systems' and 'rural social and institutional environment' for the first year students. This is seen as an orientation for students with non-agricultural background.
 
IIM-A, which has a total strength of students at about 430 put together all programmes, has decided to increase the fees by about 11.5 per cent. The fees for its PGP and PGP-ABM will increase from the present Rs 16.6 lakh to Rs 18.5 lakh for the course 2015-17. Similarly, fees for its executive programme, PGPX, IIM-A has increased the fees from Rs 21.5 lakh to Rs 24 lakh for the batches commencing from April 2015.
 
"We have had no fee hike for the past two years. In these two years, inflation increased at about 10 per cent and also, administrative costs have gone up. As the institute is financially autonomous in its operations, and to maintain our fiscal prudence, we need to increase fees," added Nanda.
 
Nanda further mentioned that the institution has been providing financial support to the students from economically weaker background. "We have disbursed financial aid of Rs 7.55 crore to 295 students in 2012-13 and Rs 6.94 crore to 242 students in 2013-14," he said.

Grand old  tired partyThe opposition looks spaced out
The Congress has precious little to show the electorate by way of agenda, action and leadership
November 18, 2014:  
The beautiful people and their eloquence in Vigyan Bhawan over the last two days was just a blip in the radar for an audience riveted to regular blockbusters from Varanasi, Myanmar and Sydney. The subtlety of Nehru-Gandhi chic is apparently no match for the razzle-dazzle of sartorial variation emanating from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stable.
To put it bluntly, the first sign of political activity from a semi-comatose Congress — in the form of the Jawaharlal Nehru Commemorative International Conference — turned out to be a bit of a damp squib.
Modi rules hearts, minds and TRP ratings, so even a usually obliging channel turned its attention entirely on Sydney’s Allphones Arena, albeit after beaming a flash of Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s exhortations on Nehru.
Off-centre Left
And if secular hearts rejoiced in sighting the Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi engaging CPI(MP) general secretary Prakash Karat in a rather lengthy dialogue, their hopes were soon to be dashed. Karat scotched reports of any tie-up with Nehru’s party in the near future.
The parliamentary Left, CPI(M) and CPI, only ceremonially marked their presence as did socialists of all hues, from HD Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal (Secular) to Sharad Yadav of the Janta Dal (United) and emissaries of Lalu Prasad Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Congress’s former fragments, DP Tripathi of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), responded to the personal invites sent by the Congress president.
But in the absence of a common programme, a charismatic leader and a vision for the future, secularism is clearly a weak glue to bind these disparate elements. To an outsider, the gathering at Vigyan Bhawan reflected the growing insecurity of each of the participants in the face of an ascendant BJP under Modi.
Accordingly, it is difficult to interpret Mamata Banerjee’s offer to join hands even with the CPI(M) to “fight communalism” as anything but a distress call in the face of the BJP’s advance in West Bengal.
The socialists have so far shown better political acumen with a quick resolution to regroup the erstwhile Janata family binding Lalu Yadav, Nitish Kumar and Mulayam Singh Yadav, to curtail the BJP in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The communists, with their enviable indifference to the loss of electoral clout, claim to be working to unite the mainstream and independent Left groups.
Odd man out
In this melee, the Congress is clearly the odd man out, without either Lalu Yadav’s native cunning or the CPI(M)’s, academically speaking, resolve to chart out a common programme with other Left groups. While the grandstanding on Nehru can be hailed as a sign of the Congress at least gathering its political wits about, it also raises questions on how exactly the Grand Old Party plans to make a connect with contemporary India.
If I remember correctly, Rahul Gandhi’s reading of the political situation a couple of years ago was that Modi does not really pose a political threat to the Congress. He believed that the Congress had more to fear from someone like Atal Behari Vajpayee who represented a more holistic vision and did not polarise the electorate. He also believed that the Congress was a natural home for Mamata Banerjee and even Mayawati. With such prophecies and political sagacity, it is no surprise that the Gandhis failed to see the ground shifting beneath their feet.
From what we saw at Vigyan Bhawan in the last two days, the Congress still does not seem to have grasped the reality of the political challenges it is facing, nor is it willing to concede that a family name alone is hardly likely to revive the party’s political fortunes. What, for instance, is the political programme for the future? In the face of a ruling party with a charismatic leader and a civilisational agenda, what alternative ideas and leadership does the Congress offer?
Wrong moves
It is no use snapping at the media as Anand Sharma did for the “total blackout” of their grand function. For making news, contemporary relevance is a pre-requisite. Homilies to an iconic leader whose policies and ideas were consistently reversed by the Congress while in power are hardly likely to enthuse an electorate that continues to be hostile to them.
The signs are that while provincial satraps will give what it takes to stop the Modi juggernaut in their respective areas, the Grand Old Party will follow its time honoured tradition of benefiting from the opponents’ mistakes or simply waiting for voter fatigue to set in.
While there is some merit in both these presumably inadvertent strategies, the Congress seems to be forgetting a critical element in today’s political chemistry. In Modi, they have an inexhaustible and creative opponent. He is capable of consistently remodelling and refashioning not just contemporary reality but also recreating the past.
The Congress will achieve precious little by invoking the past under such circumstances. The glory of ancestors is not usually a reflection of greatness in their progeny. In Rahul Gandhi’s case, it only serves to magnify his rather obvious vulnerabilities.

Modi is like a brother  says Australian PMModi is like a ‘brother’, says Australian PM
PTI
PTI Prime Minister Narendra Modi waves as his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott looks on at a reception hosted by the latter in Melbourne, Australia on Tuesday.
Melbourne, Nov 18:  
“Narendra and I.”
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said this at a joint press conference with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi after summit talks in Canberra while stressing how the two countries were expanding their cooperation in various areas.
The personal warmth Abbott shared with Modi was reflected yet again at a reception at the iconic 161-year-old Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) where he said Modi is like a “brother.”
“Narendra and I,” said Abbott on couple of occasions while referring to the determination of the two leaders to work together to help strengthening of relations.
Abbott had urged world leaders to speak from the heart rather than a script at the summit of the Group of 20 industrialised and major emerging economies at Brisbane.
“If we could use first names, that would be good as well because, whatever disagreements we might have, it helps if there can at least be personal warmth amongst us,” he said.
When Modi, the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years after Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, made his entry at the G20 Summit venue, he gave Abbott a hearty hug.
Before Modi began his address to lawmakers today, Abbott said he was determined to correct the situation where no Indian Prime Minister had addressed the Australian parliament.
He said leaders of several countries have addressed the Parliament but no Indian leader has done it.
“I am personally delighted that this has been corrected,” Abbott said.
The two leaders had several meetings — both formally and informally — during the East Asia Summit in Myanmar and at the G20 Summit at Brisbane.
“My memorable visit to Australia ends today. A new relationship has begun,” Modi said while speaking at the MCG.
At the end of his four-city Australia tour, Modi gifted a memento to Australia signed by World Cup winning Indian captains and himself.

Fight attempts to erase Nehrus legacy: RahulHeir apparent Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi delivering the key note address at the Jawaharlal Nehru Commemorative International Conference at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi on Tuesday. PRASHANT NAKWE
Congress claims Centre tried to sabotage programme
New Delhi, November 18:  
The two-day international conference organised by the Congress to commemorate the legacy of Jawaharlal Nahru has resolved to fight for strengthening democracy, inclusiveness and secularism. The party claimed the Modi Government had tried to put obstacles at every step during the programme.
A declaration adopted by the conference, read out by former Ghana President John Kufuor, cautioned the world against tendencies that are divisive or which create conflict in the society.
“As representatives of human kind, we take a solemn hope to nurture the values espoused by Nehru to pursue his vision, to imbibe his spirit and carry forward his legacy to the entire world to privilege peace and reject violence in all our activities,” the declaration said.
Addressing the conference, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said Nehru’s ideas are part of living India. “His ideas and his politics are present very much today, even though there are those who wish to rub him out, to erase him and his legacy from the country he so dearly treasured and helped build,” he said.
He added that Nehru’s idea of India is a country where a billion people choose their destiny and live in harmony together.
“India is a country where democratic principles are cherished deeply. Nehru developed and protected those democratic ideals and that is why this is a nation where one sixth of humanity lives in peace,” he said, adding that Nehru’s secular and tolerant legacy is at present more important than ever.
Space for opposition
Rahul further said Nehru understood deeply that everyone is entitled to their viewpoints. “Nehru gave space for his opposition, even when they were practically non-existent. At the time when the opposition was sparse in Parliament, he reached out to them, gave them a feeling that while electorally they may be weak, in his world they were valued partners in nation-building,” he said, apparently referring to the episode of the NDA Government’s decision to deny the status of principal Opposition party to the Congress in the Lok Sabha.
Later, talking to reporters on the conference, the secretary general of the programme Anand Sharma said the Centre did not cooperate with the Congress to hold the function at Vigyan Bhawan here.
“This government did not want the conference to take place. We were denied the venue Vigyan Bhavan on November 14, when it was not being used by anybody. We did not get cooperation. A little circular went out from here to all Indian embassies, telling them if world leaders called them, ask them to contact the Congress directly. The aim was to dissuade them from coming. There were many other difficulties,” Sharma said.
He alleged that the electronic media neglected the event completely.
“Electronic media, please redeem your respect because the world is watching and nothing remains quiet and uncommented upon. The chariot of democracy has two wheels — ruling and opposition. We hope everyone will reflect,” he said.

Wyndham Hotel Group, part of the NYSE-listed Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, is scouting for partners in India for its ‘Wyndham Garden’ brand.
The hotel chain is looking for a good location and partners in India, said Deepika Arora, Regional Vice-President of Wyndham Hotel Group.
The company’s Garden brand is mid-budget and the hotels are usually located in business districts, airports and suburbs.
Wyndham sees huge opportunities in India over the next two years.
“We have a portfolio of well-respected and global brands that span the hospitality spectrum, with a particularly strong presence in the economy and mid-scale segments,” Arora said.
“Recently, we added new Ramada, Days Inn and Howard Johnson hotels which will helps us continue to cater to increasing demand for global brands here in India.” The company has also announced a Planet Hollywood property in Goa.
“This will be the first Planet Hollywood outside the US and it speaks volumes about our commitment to the Indian market,” she said.
The group has 24 properties in India with about 2,587 rooms open under the Ramada, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, Howard Johnson and Days Inn brands and another 33 properties with about 3,753 rooms under development.
In October, the company announced the opening of 10 new properties with 1,088 rooms, taking the tally of total properties developed under Wyndham Hotel Group to 43 with a total inventory of 4,841 rooms.
The group is also preparing a blueprint to expand its footprint to Tier II and III cities and is investing in technology.
“We see this as an opportunity for us and we’re taking it very seriously. As an organisation we have built an e-commerce team and have spent $100 million on technology, including upgrading our websites and improving our direct channels,” said Arora.

Ventures get a bigger bang from the domestic buckVentures get a bigger bang from the domestic buck
THILLAI RAJAN A
Tweet
Local funders are more consistent
The buzz is in the air. Youth of all ages in India is keener than ever to pursue an entrepreneurial career. However, the entrepreneurial journey is strewn with hurdles, and success often requires an amalgamation of personal traits such as passion, hard work, determination, persistence, and more importantly, luck.
Presence of these factors, however, does not automatically grant success as business ventures need a lot more than just persona. An important reason for the failure of ventures is non-availability of risk capital in the early and growth phases of the business.
With limited collateral to support debt funding, private equity remains the common form of funding for most first generation entrepreneurs.
The growth in Venture Capital and Private Equity (VCPE) investments has significantly contributed to the development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the country. Annual VCPE investments have reached a level of $8–10 billion in recent years.
During 2000-13, VCPE capital funded over 4,000 businesses. Similar to the trend seen in stock markets and corporate investments, a substantial part of the VCPE capital that gets invested in India is from foreign sources. Our analysis showed that foreign capital accounted for close to 94 per cent of VCPE investment in the country. Fund managers also prefer to approach overseas investors when raising funds for a variety of reasons: their ability to make larger commitments and their understanding of the VCPE asset class.
Foreign capital flow
While there are several advantages with foreign capital, there are several limitations as well. For example, foreign capital flow would be highly sensitive to global developments, resulting in wide swings in capital flows. It could also be sensitive to macroeconomic factors such as currency depreciation. For example, PE fundraising from overseas investors, which was $7.8 billion in 2008, fell to $1.4 billion in 2013. Such dramatic fluctuations can act as a choke for capital seeking entrepreneurs.
On the other hand, domestic investors in general are more consistent. For example, when we classified capital providers into quartiles based on the draw-downs they participated, the proportion of domestic investors in the top quartile was 42.74 per cent whereas it was only 26.51 per cent in the bottom quartile. Therefore, in recent years, there has been a concerted effort to develop domestic capital pools for VCPE investment.
Domestic capital impact
On ground, the impact of domestic capital can be far higher. The 2014 India Venture Capital and Private Equity report released recently by the Department of Management Studies, IIT – Madras, highlights some of these. First, domestic capital seeks to invest more in early-stage deals compared with foreign capital.
A bottleneck in the Indian start-up funding environment is the availability of early-stage capital. VC funds invest in early-stage companies, whereas large PE funds make more of growth and late stage investments. Our analysis shows that, domestic sources have a higher share of their commitments to venture funds as compared to foreign sources (Fig 1).
Mobilising more domestic capital for ventures would thus address the bugbear of inadequate early-stage funding. Second, domestic capital can fund ventures in those sectors that can have a strong relevance to India.
A case in point is the investment in IT and ITeS sector. The contribution of IT and ITeS to export growth and employment generation is well known. Our results indicate that the proportion of IT & ITeS investments by VCPE funds that have domestic capital providers is substantially higher as compared to funds that have foreign investors (Fig 2). A similar trend can be seen in healthcare as well, another sector of national priority.
More importantly, domestic investors investing in VCPE funds would serve to make a statement. This was well summarised by Vikram Gandhi, the well-known investment banker, when he released the 2014 report. Said he, “Foreign investors frequently ask why should we invest in Indian entrepreneurs, when the domestic investors don't?” Rather than crowding out, increase in domestic capital, can, ipso facto, also lead to an increase in foreign capital thus making it a double bonanza for entrepreneurs.

IIM Calcutta places 450-strong batch in under three daysTweet
Mumbai, Nov 17:  
IIM Calcutta has announced that it has placed over 450 students of the batch of 2014-16, one of the largest across all IIMs, in a record time of just over 2.5 days.
The institute said in a release, that a detailed analysis has revealed that a phenomenal 378 offers (more than the batch size of many prominent IIMs) were made in Slot 0 — consisting of Day 0 and Day 1 — which is an all-time record across the IIMs. This was also a clear indication of the overall optimism prevailing in the economy and the superior quality of student inflow into the institute. IIM Calcutta played host to many new recruiters during the summer placements, prominent among them being Moelis & Co, Roland Berger and Alvarez & Marsal.
The consulting domain saw 38 offers being made by McKinsey & Company, BCG, Bain & Company and A.T. Kearney, the highest in the last three years. Roland Berger, Europe’s no.1 consulting firm, recruited from IIM Calcutta for the first time. The maximum number of offers in the consulting sector were made by Accenture with 17, closely followed by The Boston Consulting Group at 15.
Leading banks including Citibank, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, HSBC, and Standard Chartered, among others, recruited for their front-end investment banking, private equity and global markets and corporate banking roles. One of the highlights was a significant increase in the number of offers from the investment banking divisions of various banks. Moelis & Co, Funds India, and Decimus Financial, hired exclusively from IIMC. Offers from finance contributed to 25 per cent of the total offers.
The FMCG sector saw participation from industry majors such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Proctor & Gamble, Mondelez International, Asian Paints, PepsiCo, Coca Cola, L’Oreal, Reckitt Benckiser, Marico, Johnson & Johnson, and Kellogg’s, which recruited for their sales & marketing division. The general management sector had Tata Administrative Services, Mahindra and Mahindra, Aditya Birla Group, CK Birla Group and Airtel recruiting students. The West Asia-based retailing giant M.H. Alshaya Co recruited 13 students who would intern at their Kuwait and Dubai locations.
The e-commerce boom in the country translated into bumper offers being rolled out by Amazon, as it emerged the overall top recruiter with 22 offers being made across various leadership and operations roles. Media houses including Star, Times Group, HT Media and Zee Media recruited in large numbers. Analytics offers were made by the likes of EXL and Cognilytics.
Prof. Rajiv Kumar, the Placement Chairperson of IIM Calcutta said, “The continued faith of recruiters in our students’ quality has encouraged all of us at campus. But we at IIM Calcutta will continue to work hard and strive to achieve even better results in the future.”

Why rooftop solar market is not picking upWhy rooftop solar market is not picking up?
M Ramesh
A view of solar rooftop photo voltaic power panels.
Chennai, Nov. 17:  
A new report of the India-focused, German-headquartered solar consultancy, Bridge-to-India, released today puts the total rooftop solar installations in India at 285 MW, a number that is veritably small compared with the potential of the market. The consultancy’s Founder and Director, Tobias Engelmeier, puts the potential “easily” at 100,000 MW.
Engelmeier estimates that the country will have 1,500 MW of rooftop plants by 2018, but many experts doubt it.
Pashupathy Gopalan, who heads the Asia-Pacific operations of the US-based solar major, SunEdison, notes that the rooftop game in India is quite different than in the West. SunEdison, incidentally, is the third largest player in the Indian rooftop market, with a share of 3.5 per cent.
Rooftops in India are not all available for solar; most of them are already in use in a variety of ways. You only have to look at the roof of a commercial building, such as a shopping complex. Much of the space is already taken up for outdoor air-conditioner units, water tanks or even cafeterias. Similarly, residential rooftops are used for drying clothes or partying – moonlight dinners are not uncommon. Then there is the question of avoiding shading. The place for a solar rooftop plant should be such that no shadow would fall on the panels for the next 25 years.
Commercial and residential establishments therefore generally either not have the space, or prefer not to freeze the space available for solar plants, says Pashupathy.
SunEdison and Azure Power won a mandate in Gujarat to put up 2.5 MW each of solar power plants on rooftops in the city of Gandhinagar. The companies had to lease residential rooftops, put up solar plants and sell the power to the state utility. Pashupathy says SunEdison found that people were not willing to give up their space for long number of years, though they were willing to consider signing for fewer years, say, five years.
The story is different when it comes to industries. Factories have large, flat roofs which are free for use, and there is practically no issue of shadows falling on them. Factory-owning companies are also amenable to long-term contracts.
In places like Tamil Nadu, (the state, incidentally, tops the list of rooftop installations in the country, with 50 MW), industries are in pressing need for energy security too.
Chennai-based Super Auto Forge, a Rs 400-crore auto components manufacturer, put up a 600 kW rooftop system a year ago. “Without it we would not have been able to run our factory,” says S Seetharaman, Chairman and Managing Director of the company.
Experts have also said that a good way to encourage residential rooftop solar plants is to give income tax breaks. When a company puts up a solar plant it gets the tax-saving ‘accelerated depreciation’ benefit, while an individual does not get anything, even though the economic activity is the same.

India urges higher pay for millions of Gulf workersIndia urges higher pay for millions of Gulf workers
Reuters
Tweet
NEW DELHI/ DUBAI/ RIYADH, Nov 17:  
India is pressing rich countries in the Gulf to raise the wages of millions of Indians working there, in a drive that could secure it billions of dollars in fresh income but risks pricing some of its citizens out of the market.
Over 5 million Indian nationals are believed to be employed in the oil exporting states of the Gulf, the single largest group in a migrant worker population of more than 20 million.
Migrants do many of the dirty and dangerous jobs in the region, from construction to the oil industry, transport and services. They account for nearly half of the roughly 50 million population of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council.
So India's campaign for much higher pay could have an impact on economies around the region, especially if it leads to a general increase in wages for workers from other big labour-supplying countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Over the past seven months, Indian diplomats in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have sharply increased the minimum salaries that they recommend for Indian workers at private and public firms in those states.
"We want the Indian workforce to be paid higher salaries. Inflation, the value of the Indian currency and a rise in the cost of living in the Gulf were the factors that led to the decision," Y.S. Kataria, a spokesman for the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA) in New Delhi, told Reuters.
The success of India's strategy is not yet clear, however. Officials in at least some GCC nations have expressed displeasure, and the strategy could backfire if those countries end up hiring more workers from elsewhere in the world.
"Of course it will encourage companies to look at Bangladesh and Pakistan as more viable options to get migrant workers," said Mohammed Jindran, Managing Director of UAE-based recruitment agency Overseas Labour Supply.
PRESSURE
The Indian government cannot dictate the pay of its citizens in the Gulf — decisions to hire workers are made by labour recruiters in individual countries, which have not set minimum wages for migrants and usually prohibit union activity by them.
However, the recruiters must rely on the co-operation of local authorities to operate in India. An internal memorandum prepared by the MOIA, sent last month and seen by Reuters, says that if workers are offered wages below specified minimums, ministry officials "would deny emigration clearance".
In Saudi Arabia, the Indian embassy lifted the recommended minimum salary posted on its website to 1,200 riyals ($320) a month earlier this year from 670 riyals. In the UAE, the minimum wage for Indian blue-collar workers rose to 1,500 dirhams ($409) in recent weeks from 1,200 dirhams last year, Jindran said.
Even when Gulf recruiters agree to certain wage levels, the numbers do not necessarily stick. Some workers are promised one salary when they sign up in their home country, then forced to renegotiate lower wages when they arrive in the Gulf.
India's role as a top labour supplier means its drive cannot be totally ignored by recruiters, and it could have a big impact in some countries and industries. But there may be a backlash.
Another MOIA official said India's pay demands had met initial resistance in all six GCC countries, while two of the countries had threatened to reduce their Indian workforces and hire more, lower-paid workers from Bangladesh and Nepal instead.
Ahmed Al-Fahaid, Saudi deputy labour minister for international affairs, told Sky News Arabia last month:
"If this is a decision that is applied throughout India as a whole, meaning no one gets out of India for work unless with that limit, then this is a sovereign decision for the country and we will not interfere," Fahaid said.
"But if it is a special decision to raise wages for whoever comes to work in the kingdom, then we oppose it and do not accept it, as it would be an act of discrimination and we don't accept that in international agreements." He did not elaborate.
IMPACT
If India's efforts to secure higher pay succeed, they could boost its economy, because migrants send much of their pay home. India received $69 billion as remittances in 2012; a 2010 central bank study found Gulf nations accounted for 31 per cent.
Higher wages could also impact many companies. Fawwaz al-Khodari, Chief Executive of Saudi builder Abdullah Abdul Mohsin al-Khodari, said profits in the sector might be squeezed by demands from governments of some labour-exporting countries.
"In cases where salaries have been 800 to 900 riyals, we are now hearing talk of 1,500 riyals as a minimum salary, which is a huge increase...Clearly this would become a major issue in the contracting industry."

Violent clashes at  godman  Rampal s ashram leave over 200 injuredIn New York, Arvind Kejriwal says AAP set for face-off with BJP in Delhi elections
Violent clashes broke out at the Satlok Ashram of self-styled ‘godman’ Rampal here in Haryana leaving over 200 persons, including security and media personnel, injured, as efforts to arrest him were met with stiff resistance by his supporters who allegedly fired at the police and lobbed ‘petrol bombs’.
Three FIRs have been slapped against Rampal and his supporters, state DGP S N Vashisht told reporters in Chandigarh.
Police lobbed teargas shells and resorted to lathicharge to disperse Rampal’s supporters who allegedly fired back, leaving over 200 persons, including over 100 policemen, followers and several media personnel, injured.
Tension mounted as supporters of Rampal refused to heed to repeated announcements by the police over loud speakers to allow them to enter the premises to arrest him.
The DGP said firing had taken place from inside the Ashram from where people pelted stones, hurled petrol bombs and acid bottles at the security personnel.
Two policemen suffered bullet wounds. One woman sustained serious burn injuries and it remained unclear how she sustained these, the DGP said.
He said police operations would continue till Rampal, who is “definitely” holed up inside the ashram, is brought out, and produced before the
Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh, which has issued a fresh non-bailable warrant against him in a contempt case.
The FIRs have been slapped against Rampal as he has been held responsible for the violence and injuries to dozens and putting innocent lives at stake, he said.
Two other FIRs have also been registered, he said. One is in connection with the failed self immolation attempt by 50 followers by pouring diesel on them which was foiled by using water cannons.
The other is against Rampal and others for keeping followers hostage inside the Ashram.
The entire operation being carried out by police and paramilitary forces was described by Vashisht as “very tough” since they were dealing with presence of many women and children inside.
Police said that some injured had been admitted to various hospitals at Hissar, Barwala, Agroha and Uklana after being injured in the violence.
“We are committed to bringing out Rampal who is 100 per cent still inside the ashram and comply with the High Court directive,” the DGP said.
The High Court has directed the state government to produce him before it on Friday in a contempt case.
The area outside the ashram looked like a battleground with the heavy presence of police and paramilitary forces and Rampal’s supporters lining up the roof. The road was littered with stones and glass pieces.
Vashisht said as the security personnel launched the operation, they first had to face a hostile group of 50 followers who poured diesel on themselves and threatened to ignite it.
“We used water cannons. However, this group soon attacked the police with acid bottles, but we exercised restraint and managed to prevail upon them,” he said.
He said that Rampal was using a group of 2,000 to 3,000 women and children as “human shields” and they had pitched their camp outside the ashram complex for the past several days, but police managed to disperse them.
He said they were dealing with a hostile group of Rampal’s men who were armed with weapons like .315 bore guns, revolvers, pistols besides lathis.
The DGP said that a number of followers were stated to have carried licensed weapons inside the Ashram some of which had been taken by Rampal.
He said 10 live cartridges were seized from two followers who had been arrested.
Rampal’s supporters were also having crude bombs and huge quantity of stones with them.
He said retired personnel of the police and the Army were also among their ranks and some people who had been trained by them.
He said than an “LPG dump” had also been discovered during the course of the operation today when a wall was being demolished.
“Police tried to break the boundary wall, but we found a LPG dump underneath after which we exercised more caution to avoid any kind of mishappening,” he said.
“We have asked the forces to keep the complex surrounded. In the meanwhile, we halted the operation for some time to allow those followers who wanted to come out,” he said.
Asked if there had been delay on the part of the police to arrest Rampal, the DGP said they were in midst of a “very tough operation”.
“One has to understand that we are facing a very hostile group inside the ashram. We know that there are also women and children in numbers inside the ashram, and even babies, some just one-year-old. We have over-riding priority to save the innocent lives,” he said.
Meanwhile, a JCB machine was set on fire by the miscreants inside the Ashram as authorities attempted to break the third wall of the 50-feet high boundary wall surrounding the huge building.
A portion of the outer wall of the ashram was razed even as thick cloud of smoke billowed out from the roof of the Ashram which is spread over an area of 12 acres.
Towards the evening, the operation was halted as authorities gave some time to the followers to come out and cooperate so that they could carry out the job to execute the court orders to arrest Rampal.
Ashram spokesman Raj Kapoor claimed that Rampal was “unwell” and was being treated at an “undisclosed location”.
The stand-off of several days between the authorities and Rampal’s supporters took a violent turn as the Haryana government was racing against time to get hold of the ‘godman’ to meet the deadline of Friday set by Punjab and Haryana High Court for producing him in a contempt case.
Media crews faced the brunt of the violence that left some of them injured while cameras of many private electronic news channels were damaged.
An injured reporter said that some mediapersons covering the operation were suddenly chased by the cops and attacked, even though they were discharging their duties and were at a “safe distance” from the ashram.
Police said that many security personnel had also been injured in the violence including serious injuries suffered by ASI, Ravinder, as they were was firing and stone pelting from the ashram side, with some followers making last-ditch attempts to thwart the forces from storming the premises.
Asked about injuries to the mediapersons, he said, “Earlier I got two phone calls that they (media personnel) were stopped from entering the operational areas. There were 86 reporters and I permitted each one of them.
“It has been brought to my notice that some media persons have been injured in the ensuing melee or the stone pelting…One I have seen on the news that he has been beaten up by police. I assure you that the matter will be investigated,” he said.
Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was also closely monitoring the situation and was being given constant updates, his OSD, Jawahar Yadav said in Chandigarh.

Sharad Pawar puts BJP on mat  hints may bring down Maharashtra govtIn New York, Arvind Kejriwal says AAP set for face-off with BJP in Delhi elections
The Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government today found itself in an unenviable situation with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, whose party had declared outside support doing a U-turn, saying the stability of the 18-day-old dispensation was not its responsibility and asking his party workers to be ready for a snap poll.
“Having a stable government in Maharashtra isn’t NCP’s responsibility. We have to be ready to face snap polls in Maharashtra,” Pawar said addressing a two-day meeting of the party which got underway today at Alibaug in Raigad district.
“The present situation in Maharashtra is not of long term political stability. If the political instability continues, then in four to six months the state may have to face polls and that will not be good for Maharashtra,” the Maratha strongman said.
After declaring unconditional outside support to the minority BJP government the day Assembly poll threw up a hung verdict, NCP has been showing signs of a rethink in the party over continuing support to the Devendra Fadnavis government.
Pawar’s remarks come within a week of Fadnavis securing a controversial trust vote in the Assembly where the confidence motion was passed by a voice vote in complete chaos. NCP MLAs were reported to have remained seated quietly in their seats when the motion was put to a voice vote and declared passed.
Shiv Sena and Congress had disapproved of the procedure and petitioned the Governor to direct the government to seek a trust vote afresh.
Sharad Pawar had earlier said he doubted that the first BJP government in Maharashtra will last its full term, while his nephew and former Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, too, frowned upon the way the minority government had secured the trust vote.
NCP, despite announcing support to the government, has refrained from formalising it by submitting a letter to that effect to the Governor.
“Pawar’s statement isn’t unexpected. People in Maharashtra who have seen Pawar’s politics from close quarters won’t be in the least surprised by his statement today,” BJP’s state chief spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said.
“We did not seek support from NCP or appealed for help. Despite this, Pawar on his own declared unconditional support.
“This sequence of events is less than a month old. In less than a month Pawar has reneged on his own words and stance,” he said.
Fadnavis had on Sunday said his nascent ministry would be expanded ahead of the Winter Session beginning on December 8 and that the door was still open for talks with Shiv Sena for its participation in the government.
“The doors for talks with Sena are not closed. In politics such a thing never happens. Talks are possible,” Fadnavis had told reporters in Nagpur.
The talks between the two erstwhile saffron allies over forming a coalition government had collapsed over Sena’s reported demands for deputy chief ministership and some key portfolios.
Sena had staked claim to the post of Leader of Opposition a day ahead of the trust vote on November 12 and its Legislature Party leader Eknath Shinde has been accorded the status of LoP.
Amid the flip-flop by NCP, BJP had reached out to Shiv Sena yesterday, the second death anniversary of its founder Bal Thackeray, promising to fulfil the party’s demand for a befitting memorial to the late leader, an architect of the saffron alliance that weathered vicissitudes to last 25 years before coming apart ahead of the Assembly election.
While Fadnavis paid respect to Thackeray’s makeshift memorial at Shivaji Park, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is in Australia, tweeted: “On Pujya Balasaheb Thackeray’s Punya Tithi, I salute the great man who always lived for the people & stood for their well-being.”
“The life of Pujya Balasaheb Thackeray continues to inspire us. He lives in the hearts of millions,” Modi, whom Thackeray had solidly backed amid vociferous demands for his resignation as Chief Minister in the aftermath of post-Godhra riots in Gujarat, tweeted further.
However, no formal talks have reopened between the two ideologically compatible parties so far.
Sniggering at the discomfiture Pawar’s statement may have caused in BJP, Shiv Sena said the “keys” to the survival of the government was now in its hands.
“I am sure there won’t be fresh polls in Maharashtra. The Shiv Sena has the ‘keys’ to keep the government stable or unstable,” Sena MP and spokesman Sanjay Raut said.
Talking to reporters on the sidelines of an event, Uddhav said he had not decided on whether to form a coalition government with BJP.
“We have not taken any decision as of now about joining the government. We will decide according to the situation at that time. For now, I can only say we are ready to be a strong opposition party,” he said when asked if Sena will be a part of the government when the Cabinet is expanded .
“People (the BJP) who were with us for 25 years ditched us. Now we will only concentrate on standing firmly behind the common man,” he said.
In an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ yesterday, Shiv Sena had indicated it would continue to maintain distance from BJP.
“We do not need to sit and think over what went wrong (with BJP) during the Assembly elections and what happened thereafter. But whoever has brought Maharashtra to the state it is now has to repent for the misdeeds. They should not look to Sena with hope in the future,” it had said.
On Pawar’s remarks asking his partymen to be prepared for a snap poll, Uddhav said the NCP leader was not a man of his words.
“Sharad Pawar himself doesn’t know what he is speaking which is why he makes such immature comments. Whatever this man (Pawar) says he never does and what he actually has in mind he never says,” Thackeray said.
When asked whether MNS leader Raj Thackeray’s meeting with him at an event on the second death anniversary of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray signalled a move toward reunion between the estranged cousins, Uddhav said no political motive should be read into it.
“Raj had come yesterday because of his love for Balasaheb. It should not be politicised,” he said.

India is the slavery capital of the world'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
Nearly 14.3 million people, including children, are “trapped” in modern-day slavery in India, which tops a global index of people under bondage across the world with an estimated 35.8 million people enslaved, a new research said today.
The Global Slavery Index (GSI) 2014, published by the Walk Free Foundation in Perth in Australia, said India and Pakistan account for 45 per cent of the global total.
The report estimates that over 23.5 million people in Asia are living in modern-day slavery. This is equivalent to almost two-thirds of the global total number of people enslaved.
“Of these, over 14.2 million are in India and over 2.05 million are in Pakistan which demonstrate the highest prevalence of modern slavery in Asia (1.141 per cent and 1.13 per cent of their populations respectively). Together these two alone represent 45 per cent of the global total,” it said.
Global Slavery Index 2014: Read full report
(India report on page 39)
In South Asia, these countries are followed in prevalence by Nepal (0.823 per cent of the population, 228,700 people), Bangladesh (0.435 per cent, 680,900 people), Afghanistan (0.435 per cent, 132,800 people) and Sri Lanka (0.359 per cent, 73,600 people).
The report said that the people are trapped in slavery through human trafficking, forced labour, debt bondage, forced or servile marriage or commercial sexual exploitation.
“In terms of absolute numbers, India remains top of the list with an estimated 14.29 million enslaved people followed by China (3.24m), Pakistan (2.06m), Uzbekistan (1.2m, new to the top five), and Russia (1.05m).
“Together these account for 61 per cent of the world’s modern slavery or nearly 22 million people,” it said.
The research report also said that “an estimated 35.8 million men, women and children around the world are today trapped in modern slavery, just over 20 per cent more than previously estimated,” the report said.
The Index was created in consultation with an panel of experts from international organizations, think tanks and academic institutions and also said that slavery exists in each of the 167 countries included in it.
The research said countries with the biggest challenges were taking important steps to tackle the problem.
“India for example has strengthened its criminal justice framework through legislative amendments and has established 215 Anti-Human Trafficking Police Units. Much more needs to be done,” it said.
Chairman of the Foundation, Andrew Forrest said there is an assumption that slavery is an issue from a bygone era or that it only exists in countries ravaged by war and poverty.
“These findings show that modern slavery exists in every country. We are all responsible for the most appalling situations where modern slavery exists and the desperate misery it brings upon our fellow human beings.
“The first step in eradicating slavery is to measure it. And with that critical information, we must all come together – governments, businesses and civil society – to finally bring an end to the most severe form of exploitation,” he said.
The report said Mauritania has the highest proportion (prevalence) of its population in modern slavery at 4 per cent, while Iceland and
Luxembourg have the lowest number of people enslaved in both prevalence and in absolute numbers, estimated at less than 100 each, closely followed by Ireland with under 300.
It said countries identified as leading the fight to end modern slavery include Netherlands, Sweden, the US, Australia, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway, the UK, Georgia and Austria.
Those countries with the weakest responses to modern slavery in 2014 are North Korea, Iran, Syria, Eritrea, the Central African Republic, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Uzbekistan, Republic of the Congo and Iraq.
The Walk Free Foundation is a global organisation with a mission to end modern slavery in our generation by mobilising a global activist movement, generating the highest quality research, enlisting business and raising unprecedented levels of capital to drive change in those countries.

Rahul warns those  rubbing out  Nehru legacyIn New York, Arvind Kejriwal says AAP set for face-off with BJP in Delhi elections
In a veiled attack on Narendra Modi-led dispensation, Rahul Gandhi today slammed those who were trying to “rub out” Jawaharlal Nehru from history as an international conference on the country’s first Prime Minister affirmed that democracy, inclusion and empowerment espoused by him were of “enduring relevance”.
In her concluding remarks at the two-day conference called by the Congress, Party President Sonia Gandhi said as the Nehruvian concepts have come under challenge now, “we must not only adhere to what Nehru had built. We must fight and fight to strengthen democracy, inclusiveness and secularism.”
Holding that Nehru’s ideas were a “matter of shared interest” that concern all sections, she said the declaration reaffirms a collective commitment to nurture these views.
“We the delegates representing 20 countries, 29 political parties and organisations participating in the international conference on Nehru’s world view and his legacy…caution the world against tendencies that are divisive or which create conflict in the society,” the declaration read by former President of Ghana John Kufuor said.
“As representatives of human kind, we take a solemn hope to nurture the values espoused by Nehru to pursue his vision, to imbibe his spirit and carry forward his legacy to the entire world to privilege peace and reject violence in all our activities…” it further said.
The conference which sought to highlight the legacy and world view of Nehru was attended by a host of international leaders and representatives of various political parties from India and abroad.
Those participated in the conference include former President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai, John Kufuor of Ghana, General Obasanjo of Nigeria, former Prime Minister Madhav K Nepal of Nepal and Dorji Wangmo Wangchuk, Queen Mother of Bhutan besides Asma Jehangir from Pakistan, veteran South African freedom fighter Ahmed Kathrada and leadership delegations from 11 political parties across the globe.
The New Delhi conference had two subject sessions — ‘Inclusive Democracy and People’s Empowerment’ and ‘Nehru’s Worldview and a Democratic Global Order for the 21st century’.
A highlight of the event today was the presence of Samajwadi Party General Secretary Ramgopal Yadav.
Yesterday arch-rivals Mamata Banerjee from Trinamool Congress and Prakash Karat Sitaram Yechury from CPI-M D Raja from CPI attended the event together along with former Prime Minister and JD(S) chief HD Devegowda, JD(U) President Sharad Yadav and NCP general secretary DP Tripathi.
The Jawaharlal Nehru Commemorative International Conference was the first major event organised by the party afters its worst-ever drubbing in Lok Sabha polls.

Nexus 6 up for pre-order on Flipkart for Rs 43 999: MotorolaCisco partners with ILFS Technologies to develop projects for smart cities
Handset maker Motorola has said its latest smartphone – Nexus 6 – priced Rs 43,999 onwards, can be pre-ordered in India on Flipkart from today.
Developed by US-based Motorola, the Nexus 6 was launched globally by Google last month and will be made available in India through the online mega store from second week of December.
The 32 GB version of the device is priced at Rs 43,999, while the 64GB version will be available for Rs 48,999. The device will be available in Midnight Blue and Cloud White colours.
With Nexus 6, Motorola has worked with Google to bring users a bigger phone with more screen, speed and power, Motorola said in a statement.
“It’s the best Android experience ever with the latest specs and technology built in,” it added.
Nexus 6 will be available with four exclusive offers like 3-month free subscription of Flipkart First, exchange offer for getting upto Rs 10,000 discount, Rs 1,500 cash back and free pre-selected Flipkart eBooks worth Rs 2,100.
Featuring a 5.96-inch display, Nexus 6 will come with the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system. Weighing 184 grams, the device has a 13 MP rear and 2 MP front camera.
Motorola said that once Android 5.0 Lollipop is officially released, it intends to bring this latest upgrade to many of its other devices as well.
“This includes Moto X (1st and 2nd Gen), Moto G (2nd Gen) and Moto E. We’re still working out the details on timing and the upgrade depends on our partners’ support,” it said.
Besides, another player Asus today said its Nexus 7 tablets are among the first wave of Android devices to receive the Android 5.0 Lollipop OS update.

Google deal in bag  world s top drugmaker Novartis takes aim at technologyCisco partners with ILFS Technologies to develop projects for smart cities
Talent spotters from Novartis AG, charged with bringing new ideas into the organisation, are casting their net beyond biotech into the wider pool of wearable, or even edible, technology.
It’s not that the world’s biggest drugmaker by sales wants to make the next smart watch. Rather, its researchers are seeking fresh ways to monitor exactly how the company’s medicines are working and being taken by patients.
Chief Executive Joe Jimenez predicts this will be an integral part of running a big pharmaceutical company in the coming decade, as rising healthcare demand coupled with limited budgets force drugmakers to generate hard data to prove their drugs are delivering results.
The Swiss group has already taken tentative steps, signing a deal with Google Inc in July to develop contact lenses to help diabetics track blood glucose levels or restore the eye’s ability to focus.
It also has an agreement with privately held Proteus Digital Health to develop tablets containing embedded microchips that can tell if patients have taken their medication.
Its ambitions, however, stretch a lot further.
“We’ve done more than most but certainly not enough. You’re going to see a continued focus from this company that will be quite technology agnostic,” Jimenez said in an interview during an FT pharmaceutical conference in London.
“It may be niche today but in the future I think it is going to be front and centre as to how diseases are managed.”
TECH FIRMS TARGET HEALTH
The interest comes at a time when technology companies are increasingly pushing from the other direction in an effort to find new ways for patients to monitor their own health and track chronic conditions using smart devices.
Businesses such as Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Google are all trying to find health-related applications for their wearable products.
While drugmakers are certainly not short of demand for their medicines, as populations get older and sicker, finding the money to pay for costly new interventions is another matter.
Clashes between governments and drugmakers over pricing are becoming more common – most notably in cancer and hepatitis C treatment – and the industry acknowledges a need to move to a system of payment based on clinical outcomes, rather than a price per pill.
Jimenez is convinced remote monitoring technology will play a central role in this respect, both to help healthcare systems check if patients are improving and also to protect companies that need to ensure they are not penalised for a drug failing if a patient does not take his or her medicine.
The approach has potential to work well for a company like Novartis, which hopes to launch a new drug for the debilitating condition of heart failure next year.
“If there were a wearable device that could help the patient and their physician understand whether or not to come to the hospitals then that, together with our drug, could be a very potent combination,” Jimenez said.
“It doesn’t mean we will own the technologies, but it does mean the technologies will play an important role in the management of disease.”

Stocks take a breather after BSE Sensex hits lifetimehighBSE Sensex eases further on selling in IT sector
Indian stocks edged lower today as investors took a breather after benchmark Sensex hit lifetime high of 28,282.85 and closed with a loss of 14.59 points on profit-booking in IT, realty and oil & gas shares.
Surpassing all previous records, the 30-share BSE barometer resumed higher and rallied to scale a new peak but emergence of profit-booking in recent out-performers at record levels wiped off early gains. The BSE index finally settled at at 28,163.29, down 14.59 points, or 0.05 per cent — snapping a two-day upmove. Intra-day, it had touched a low of 28119.95.
The gauge’s previous intra-day life high of 28,205.71 and record close of 28,177.88 was logged yesterday. The Sensex had garnered 237.24 points in the previous two sessions.
Likewise, the NSE Nifty after hitting all-time high of 8,454.50, beating previous record of 8,438.10 (intra-day), fell back to close 4.85 points, or 0.06 per cent, down at 8,425.90. Yesterday, it had closed at its record high of 8,430.75.
“Profit booking at current levels and mixed expectations about probable curbs on gold import kept the stocks markets volatile throughout the day,” said Hiren Dhakan, Associate Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 656.37 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from stock exchanges.
IT, realty, consumer durables, oil & gas, FMCG and healthcare stocks attracted profit-booking, while capital goods, power, metal, auto, banking and PSU shares recorded further gains.
In the 30-share Sensex, 16 stocks declined while 14 rose.
Stocks of HDFC fell 1.90 per cent on concerns the mortgage lender will have to shed some of its holdings in HDFC Bank after FIPB classified the parent’s holdings in the banking arm as foreign investment.
Other Sensex laggards include Sun Pharma (1.94 per cent), Hindalco ( 1.61 per cent), ONGC (1.49 per cent), TCS (1.18 per cent), Cipla (0.81 per cent) and Infosys (0.76 per cent).
In broader markets, sugar company stocks like Shree Renuka Sugar, Balrampur Chini and Dhampur Sugar hogged the limelight on expectations of export subsidy announcement.

Omegas Einhorn sees stock market rallying into2015Mutual fund assets drop by Rs 5,344 crore to Rs 10.9 lakh crore in November
Hedge fund Omega Advisors expects to see the U.S. stock market’s bull run continue into next year, fueled by steady economic growth and a corporate takeover boom.
“My expectation is for the Standard & Poor’s 500 (stock market index) to gain 7 percent to 9 percent in 2015,” Steven Einhorn, Omega’s vice chairman said on Monday. He made his remarks at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York.
Next year’s gains likely will be fueled by a continued boom in corporate takeovers. And borrowing costs should remain at rock-bottom levels as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates slowly and deliberately, Einhorn explained.
Omega, founded by Leon Cooperman two decades ago and seen as one of the world’s most widely watched hedge funds, invests primarily in U.S. equities and owns stocks including Actavis Inc , the pharmaceutical company making a bid for rival Allergan &lt;AGN.N, and Apple Inc, the world’s most valuable public company.
October’s brief stock market tumble, which hurt many hedge funds when investors were crowded into the same names and got out in a hurry, should not overshadow next year’s prognosis.
“October portends nothing negative for 2015,” Einhorn said.
Indeed, he is looking for the pace of mergers and acquisitions, already high this year, to keep picking up next year as reasonable financing remains available. Sectors such as healthcare could see more activity, he predicted.
He expects economic growth in the United States to be somewhere between 2.5 and 3 percent, which he says is preferable to robust growth which might frighten the Fed into raising rates more quickly. For now, he expects rate increases to happen at a measured pace which should be a positive signal for investors, underscoring that the economy is growing steadily while not booming.
Looking to Europe, Einhorn said there are even more opportunities there for smart stock market investments next year, especially given the European Central Bank’s easy money policies.
Earnings growth, for example, is likely to be in the low to middle double digits in Europe, outpacing U.S. estimates.

Gold price recovers on wedding season demand; globalcuesGold prices recovered by Rs 40 to Rs 26,800 per ten gram at the bullion market in the national capital today on scattered buying by jewellers and retailers to meet ongoing wedding season demand and a firming global trend.
Silver, however, remained under selling pressure and fell further by Rs 685 to Rs 35,815 per kg.
Traders said some buying from jewellers and retailers, driven by ongoing wedding season and a firming global trend where gold rose to over two-week high as a weakening dollar spurred demand for a safe-haven, mainly influenced the sentiment.
Gold in Singapore, which normally determine price trend on the domestic front, gained 0.6 per cent to USD 1,193.45 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity recovered by Rs 40 each to Rs 26,800 and Rs 26,600 per ten gram respectively. It had lost Rs 90 in yesterday’s trade.
Sovereign, however, continued to be traded at the last level of Rs 23,800 per piece of eight gram in limited deals.
On the other hand, silver ready fell by Rs 685 to Rs 35,815 per kg, while weekly-based delivery strengthened by Rs 95 to Rs 36,250 per kg on speculators’ buying.
Meanwhile, silver coins were unaltered at Rs 60,000 for buying and Rs 61,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Gold holds below 2-week high on robust dollar  U.S.economyGold futures price falls on global cues
Gold held below a two-week peak on Tuesday, its safe-haven appeal dulled with the dollar near a four-year high and growing signs of strength in the U.S. economy.
The dollar held steady on Tuesday after European Central Bank officials raised the prospects of further stimulus and as investors waited to see if Japan’s leader would call a snap election after the country slipped into recession.
A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated gold more expensive for holders of other currencies and also weakens its appeal as a hedge.
“Movements in the dollar continue to be the major catalyst for moves in gold, with sharp rallies predominantly the result of short-covering,” MKS Capital trader James Gardiner said.
“There should be initial support on the downside around $1,181-82, and on the topside $1,200 will be the key resistance.”
Spot gold was steady at $1,187.95 an ounce by 0730 GMT, just down from a two-week high of $1,193.95 hit in the previous session.
U.S. economic data on Monday also hurt gold’s appeal as a hedge. While U.S. manufacturing output rose only modestly, other data showed a rebound in factory activity in New York State.
Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.33 percent to 723.01 tonnes on Monday, the first increase since Nov. 3.
In a reflection of investor sentiment, however, holdings in the fund – which marks its tenth anniversary on Tuesday – were still near a six-year low.
The ETF counts hedge fund Paulson & Co as its top investor.
Elsewhere, India’s central bank is in talks with the government to increase curbs on gold imports and an announcement could come as early as Tuesday, a finance ministry source said.
More curbs could hit demand from India, the second biggest gold consumer, and add pressure on gold prices.
In top consumer China, local prices held steady at a premium of $2-$3 an ounce, as buying picked up on steadier prices. Sustained robust buying could support prices.

BSE Sensex companies total market value close to Rs 100 lakhcroreBSE Sensex eases further on selling in IT sector
The total market valuation of the BSE-listed companies is nearing the Rs 100 lakh crore-mark following the continued dream run of the bourse.
At present, the total market capitalisation (m-cap) of BSE-listed companies stands at Rs 99,47,809 crore, just Rs 52,191 crore short of the Rs 100 lakh crore milestone.
India had first entered the trillion-dollar club in June 2007, but moved out in September 2008 after a global meltdown. It again got back into the elite league in May 2009 and largely remained there except for some brief time, including once in 2012. In August 2013, it again moved out of the list.
The Sensex has gained 7,007.2 points, or 33 per cent, so far this year.
The index touched its all-time high of 28,282.85 today.
The Sensex blue-chips whose market valuation is more than Rs 1 lakh crore include TCS, ONGC, RIL, ITC, Infosys, HDFC Bank, Coal India, SBI, ICICI Bank, Sun Pharma, HDFC, HUL, L&T, Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Wipro, NTPC, HCL Tech, Axis Bank and Maruti.
At present, outsourcing major TCS is the most valued Indian company with a market cap of Rs 5,09,758.96 crore.
Experts said that Indian markets are also helped with smart foreign fund inflows.
Since the beginning of the year, foreign investors have made a net investment of USD 15.3 billion (Rs 91,780) crore into the country’s equity market.

FII investments via P-Notes surges to USD 43 billion inOctBSE Sensex eases further on selling in IT sector
Investments into domestic shares through participatory notes (P-Notes) surged to the highest level in more than six-and-half years at Rs 2.65 lakh crore (about USD 43 billion) in October.
According to the data released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the total value of P-Note investments in Indian markets (equity, debt and derivatives) rose to Rs 2,65,675 crore at the end of October from Rs 2,22,394 crore in September.
This is the highest level since February 2008, when the cumulative value of such investments stood at Rs 3,22,743 crore.
P-Notes, mostly used by overseas HNIs (High Networth Individuals), hedge funds and other foreign institutions, allow them to invest in Indian markets through registered Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), while saving on time and costs associated with direct registration.
According to market analysts, investment into the equity market via P-Notes had been rising in the past few months, mainly on account of the government’s reforms agenda and a rally in the country’s equity markets.
It shot up in May, post the General Election results, primarily on the new government’s promise to revive economic growth and the momentum continued till October.
P-Note investments in Indian markets have climbed to Rs 1.86 lakh crore in October from Rs 1.68 lakh crore in the preceding month.
The quantum of FII investments through P-Notes grew to 12.2 per cent last month from 10.7 per cent in September.
Till a few years ago, P-Notes used to account for more than 50 per cent of the total FII investments, but their share has fallen after Sebi tightened the disclosure norms and other regulations for such investments.
P-Notes have been accounting for mostly 15-20 per cent of the total FII holdings in India since 2009, while it used to be much higher — in the range of 25-40 per cent — in 2008.
It was as high as over 50 per cent at the peak of Indian stock market bull run during a few months in 2007.

Govt to take imminent steps to curb surging gold imports as trade deficit fearsriseGold futures price falls on global cues
India is likely to announce measures to curb gold imports as early as Tuesday, a senior finance ministry source said, as a surge in inbound shipments threatens to worsen the country’s trade deficit.
“We are working on it. The measures to slow gold imports are almost ready and may be announced today or tomorrow,” said the source, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Gold imports into India, the world’s No. 2 gold consumer behind China, surged nearly fourfold in October to $4.18 billion from a year ago, data showed on Monday.
Although India’s trade deficit has so far been kept in check by lower oil imports, analysts warn that is unlikely to last if inbound gold shipments continue to surge.
Struggling with high current account and trade deficits, India last year raised the import duty on gold to a record 10 percent and imposed other import restrictions, some of which it relaxed in May.
Imports of the precious metal have risen steadily since August, boosted by jewellery demand for the wedding season, raising concerns among policymakers.
Last Thursday, officials from the Reserve Bank of India and the finance ministry met to review the country’s gold import policy, but no decision was taken.

Commodity slump threatens return to junk for top emergingnationsGold futures price falls on global cues
Slumping prices for oil and other commodities and the prospect of rising global interest rates threaten to return some of the biggest emerging market (EM) nations to “junk” credit ratings, laying bare many countries’ failure to reform in the good times.
Emerging economies have earned roughly 200 rating upgrades since 2007, nearly half of them to the top “investment grade” category but this year Standard and Poor’s has made around a third more EM downgrades than upgrades.
Those left three of the biggest names in the EM universe – Russia, Brazil and South Africa – just one cut away from “junk”, after a decade of rising ratings that helped drive the roughly $8 trillion investment that has poured into EM stocks and bonds.
“At the moment you have a number of triple-B credits on the brink (of junk),” Bank of America-Merrill Lynch head of fixed income and economics for EEMEA, David Hauner, said.
“The implications are bigger than of a normal downgrade. It will be interesting to see if crossover investors (who usually buy developed markets assets) will be willing to stay invested.”
BNP Paribas estimates that if oil stays around $80 a barrel for the next few years, producers in the Gulf, Russia, Latin American and Africa could see their ratings cut by between half a notch and two notches – far more if it sinks to $60.
Standard and Poor’s EMEA head of sovereign ratings, Moritz Kraemer, stresses that the impact of a such a sustained period of lower oil prices will vary from country to country.
While IMF data shows Saudi Arabia, Russia and Nigeria need prices above $90 to balance their budgets, the first two have large currency reserves and others, such as Kuwait or Kazakhstan, would stay in the black even at $65.
Kraemer noted that some emerging markets – for example, Turkey – would benefit from falling oil prices.
S&P is due to review Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Turkey before the end of the year.
BNP’s analysis suggests that $80 oil would see Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan lose investment grade status, Africa’s producers would fall deeper into junk territory, while the Middle East would see a wave of downgrades.
S&P’s data shows that both Russia and Brazil, which are on the lowest investment grade rung at BBB-, are already being treated as junk by markets.
But it is not all bad news. Roughly 70 percent of EM nations are resource-hungry oil importers, meaning the 30 percent price fall this year is a major boon.
Moody’s Analytics head, Mark Zandi, says that could lift growth in India – another BBB- credit – by a full percentage point and will be a big benefit for any country that subsidises energy costs.
Deutsche Bank also flag up South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Hungary, Czech Republic, South Africa, Poland, Thailand and Mexico as beneficiaries, although the benefit for BBB- South Africa is offset by the 15 percent fall in the price of big exports, gold and platinum, over the last year.
“One thing we can say for sure, a downgrade to junk (for the major EM nations) would have a material impact in terms of flows for the whole emerging asset class,” said Bank of America-Merrill Lynch’s Hauner.
“It’s becoming a key story that we should watch for in 2015.”

Financial Technologies signs pact to sell Mauritius-based bourse for Rs 250crBSE Sensex eases further on selling in IT sector
Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL) on Monday said it has signed a pact to sell its Mauritius-based exchange for USD 40.5 million (about Rs 250 crore) to Continental Africa Holdings Ltd.
FTIL decided to exit the exchange business and focus on its core technology business after the Rs 5,600 crore scam surfaced at its Indian subsidiary NSEL last year.
In a filing to the BSE, Jignesh Shah-led FTIL said the Board of its Mauritius-based subsidiary FT Group Investments Pvt Ltd has “approved the sale of 100 per cent of its stake in Bourse Africa Ltd, Mauritius to Continental Africa Holdings Ltd, Mauritius, for USD 40.5 million”.
The Mauritius arm today signed a definitive agreement with Continental Africa Holdings. The deal is subject to certain customary closing conditions. The entire transaction is expected to be completed within the next 210 days, it said.
Bourse Africa is an international multi-asset class exchange that offers trading on commodity derivatives, African and global currency derivatives.
In past few months, FTIL has exited from MCX and IEX. It has sold its entire 26 per cent stakes in the commodity bourse MCX for about Rs 900 crore and also sold nearly 26 per cent stake in IEX for Rs 576.84 crore.
Earlier this year, it had sold its stake in National Bulk Handling Corp for Rs 242 crore.
FTIL has been exiting the exchange business after commodity markets regulator FMC in December last year declared it to be unfit to run any exchanges in view of the NSEL payment crisis.

Editorial: Still dusk outthereMutual fund assets drop by Rs 5,344 crore to Rs 10.9 lakh crore in November
It has been another disappointing earnings season from corporate India, with headline numbers coming in way below estimates; net profits for the Sensex, in the three months to September, have grown just 6% yoy while aggregate sales for a sample of 2,439 firms (excluding banks and financials) grew just 3.5% yoy. That’s an indication of how companies are neither able to push through volumes nor command pricing power in what is undoubtedly a challenging economic environment. The silver lining has been the performance of the IT sector which continues to fare reasonably well. Otherwise, management commentary has been extremely cautious. Larsen & Toubro, for instance, has tempered its revenue guidance for the current year and Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairman, State Bank of India (SBI) was unambiguous in saying the recovery was going to be a very gradual one with at least a year to go for the pace to pick up. That seems a realistic assessment given how loan growth in Q2FY15 grew at a multi-quarter low.
The core sector clearly remains under pressure and while softer commodity prices should help ease cost pressure in the months ahead, in the September quarter, several firms ended paying more for raw materials for various reasons. At Hindalco, for instance, operating profits came in below estimates, thanks largely to an increase in energy costs. Again, Tata Steel’s standalone raw material costs increased 13% sequentially because it imported more iron ore—a couple of the firm’s mines have been suspended because the leases have not been renewed.
The bad news is that capital goods firms aren’t really seeing a rush of orders although there are signs of a pick-up. At BHEL, for instance, while there was some uptick in order inflows, it came off a very low base and the firm’s order backlog at the end of the quarter remained flat yoy. Indeed, subdued volumes reported by cement companies is evidence of the sluggishness in sectors such as construction. In the consumer space, even large firms like Hindustan Unilever are finding the going tough and the management’s observations suggest that the demand environment is still soft and that there are no visible green shoots to signal an imminent acceleration in volume growth. That consumers are reluctant to spend can be seen from the weak volumes reported by players like Bajaj Auto.
With demand for both capital goods, materials and consumer durables goods still weak, firms like Tata Motors continued to do badly with the domestic business, posting a loss on the back of a marginal fall in sales. While consumer demand should see a rebound once inflation eases further and interest rates drop, the high leverage in corporate India, regulatory uncertainty and hurdles in acquiring land could delay investments in fresh capacity to FY16 or beyond. In other words, those investing in the market bull run would do well to pencil in 4-6 quarters of subdued growth.

Buy AB Nuvo on strong Q2  high dividend:UBSBSE Sensex eases further on selling in IT sector
We recommend buying Aditya Birla Nuvo (ABNL) and maintain our positive view on the stock as it offers exposure to a number of quality businesses. We raise earnings estimates as well as target price on account of higher than expected dividends received in Q2FY15 and the strong performance during Q2FY15, especially from the fertiliser segment. We raise our FY15e earnings estimates by 6%, and broadly maintain our estimates for FY16/FY17. We raise target price to R2,150 from R2,100.
ABNL standalone revenue came in at R2,530 crore, ahead of UBS estimate of R2,400 crore primarily driven by better than expected fertilisers, VFY and garments segments. Reported ebitda stood at R350 crore versus our estimate of R290 crore, on account of better profitability in these segments, compensating for weaker than expected textiles performance. Net profit for the quarter came at R260 crore ahead of our forecast of R170 crore, driven by better than expected operating performance and higher other income on account of higher dividends received from BSLI and Idea. All segment except textiles reported better than expected performance in Q2FY15.
NBFC business recorded robust loan growth of 64% y-o-y led by corporate finance and mortgage segments. Asset quality was healthy with GNPLs/NNPLs declining from 1.25%/0.5% in Q1FY15 to 1.15%/0.37% in Q2FY15.

We have cut our consolidated earnings estimates by 4-10% over CY14/15 driven by cut in VE Commerical Vehicles (VECV) volumes. We have raised our target price to R9,000 from R8,300 as we roll-over to September 2016 from March 2016.
VECV business beats estimates. Eicher Motors reported consolidated net profit of R165 crore (up 54% y-o-y) which exceeded our estimates with higher-than-expected revenues in the VECV business. Strong volume growth in RE business continues to drive consolidated earnings growth. The RE business reported a stellar quarter with a 128% y-o-y growth in net profit while volumes grew by 70% y-o-y.
VECV business reported net sales of R1450 crore (up 17% y-o-y), 14% higher than our expectations. Volumes grew by 3% y-o-y led by light commercial vehicle volumes while heavy-duty truck volumes remained subdued. Gross margin improved by 110 bps y-o-y driven by higher share of 7.5-12 MT trucks in the mix which is Eicher’s key volume segment.

With 14.3 mn enslaved people  India is the slavery capital of the world: Global Slavery Index'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
Nearly 14.3 million people, including children, are “trapped” in modern-day slavery in India, which tops a global index of people under bondage across the world with an estimated 35.8 million people enslaved, a new research said today.
The Global Slavery Index (GSI) 2014, published by the Walk Free Foundation in Perth in Australia, said India and Pakistan account for 45 per cent of the global total.
The report estimates that over 23.5 million people in Asia are living in modern-day slavery. This is equivalent to almost two-thirds of the global total number of people enslaved.
“Of these, over 14.2 million are in India and over 2.05 million are in Pakistan which demonstrate the highest prevalence of modern slavery in Asia (1.141 per cent and 1.13 per cent of their populations respectively). Together these two alone represent 45 per cent of the global total,” it said.
Global Slavery Index 2014: Read full report
(India report on page 39)
In South Asia, these countries are followed in prevalence by Nepal (0.823 per cent of the population, 228,700 people), Bangladesh (0.435 per cent, 680,900 people), Afghanistan (0.435 per cent, 132,800 people) and Sri Lanka (0.359 per cent, 73,600 people).
The report said that the people are trapped in slavery through human trafficking, forced labour, debt bondage, forced or servile marriage or commercial sexual exploitation.
“In terms of absolute numbers, India remains top of the list with an estimated 14.29 million enslaved people followed by China (3.24m), Pakistan (2.06m), Uzbekistan (1.2m, new to the top five), and Russia (1.05m).
“Together these account for 61 per cent of the world’s modern slavery or nearly 22 million people,” it said.
The research report also said that “an estimated 35.8 million men, women and children around the world are today trapped in modern slavery, just over 20 per cent more than previously estimated,” the report said.
The Index was created in consultation with an panel of experts from international organizations, think tanks and academic institutions and also said that slavery exists in each of the 167 countries included in it.
The research said countries with the biggest challenges were taking important steps to tackle the problem.
“India for example has strengthened its criminal justice framework through legislative amendments and has established 215 Anti-Human Trafficking Police Units. Much more needs to be done,” it said.
Chairman of the Foundation, Andrew Forrest said there is an assumption that slavery is an issue from a bygone era or that it only exists in countries ravaged by war and poverty.
“These findings show that modern slavery exists in every country. We are all responsible for the most appalling situations where modern slavery exists and the desperate misery it brings upon our fellow human beings.
“The first step in eradicating slavery is to measure it. And with that critical information, we must all come together – governments, businesses and civil society – to finally bring an end to the most severe form of exploitation,” he said.
The report said Mauritania has the highest proportion (prevalence) of its population in modern slavery at 4 per cent, while Iceland and
Luxembourg have the lowest number of people enslaved in both prevalence and in absolute numbers, estimated at less than 100 each, closely followed by Ireland with under 300.
It said countries identified as leading the fight to end modern slavery include Netherlands, Sweden, the US, Australia, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway, the UK, Georgia and Austria.
Those countries with the weakest responses to modern slavery in 2014 are North Korea, Iran, Syria, Eritrea, the Central African Republic, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Uzbekistan, Republic of the Congo and Iraq.
The Walk Free Foundation is a global organisation with a mission to end modern slavery in our generation by mobilising a global activist movement, generating the highest quality research, enlisting business and raising unprecedented levels of capital to drive change in those countries.

Earth smashed by 556 fiery asteroids in last 20 yearsDilip Kumar recovering from illness in hospital; to be discharged soon
Over 556 small asteroids smashed into the Earth over the last 20-years, NASA researchers have found, suggesting that fiery space rocks are bombarding into the planet’s atmosphere at a stunning rate.
A map released by NASA’s Near Earth Object (NEO) Programme shows that small asteroids frequently enter and disintegrate in the Earth’s atmosphere with random distribution around the globe.
Released to the scientific community, the map visualises data gathered by US government sensors from 1994 to 2013.
The data indicate that Earth’s atmosphere was impacted by small asteroids, resulting in a bolide (or fireball), on 556 separate occasions in a 20-year period between 1994 and 2013.
Almost all asteroids of this size disintegrate in the atmosphere and are usually harmless. The notable exception was the Chelyabinsk event which was the largest asteroid to hit Earth in this period, NASA said.
The new data could help scientists better refine estimates of the distribution of the sizes of NEOs including larger ones that could pose a danger to Earth.
“Finding and characterising hazardous asteroids to protect our home planet is a high priority,” NASA researchers said.
“It is one of the reasons NASA has increased by a factor of 10 investments in asteroid detection, characterisation and mitigation activities over the last five years,” they said.
NASA has also aggressively developed strategies and plans with its partners in the US and abroad to detect, track and characterise NEOs.
These activities will help identify NEOs that might pose a risk of Earth impact, and further help inform developing options for planetary defence, researchers said.

Vitamin D helps relieve pain among diabetic patients:StudyPrint
Written by Tanbir Dhaliwal | Chandigarh | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:56 am
The burning sensation and severe pain, which diabetic patients usually suffer from, can be relieved to some extent by taking vitamin D, according to a study presented during a national conference of endocrinologists at PGI last week.
With time, diabetic patients develop nerve damage throughout the body, which causes pain, tingling, or numbness in the hands, arms, feet and legs, and can also affect organs like the digestive tract and the heart. These disorders are called diabetic peripheral neuropathies.
The study, conducted by endocrinologists from Chennai-based Sri Ramachandra University, found that vitamin D supplementation decreases the severity of symptoms in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
Conducted by Bubblu Tamilselvan, Nagendra Kumar, Krishna Seshadri, Manu Kurian and Lakshmi G, the 24-week-long study covered 45 patients with type 2 diabetes who suffered from typical motor and sensory neuropathy symptoms and had low vitamin D levels.
Patients with vitamin D levels less than 30ng/ml (nanogram per millilitre) were supplemented with 60,000IU (international units) of vitamin D per week for a period of six weeks, followed by 2,000IU vitamin D per day for 18 weeks. Patients with vitamin D levels within the range of 30 to 50ng/ml were supplemented with 2,000IU vitamin D per day for 24 weeks.
The patients showed a decrease in the severity of neuropathy symptoms. With changes in vitamin D level in their blood, their diabetic neuropathy score, and the neuropathy disability score improved, the study noted.
In diabetic neuropathy score, the symptoms of the patients are graded from 1 to 4. Neuropathy disability score is decided after examining the patient on the basis of DNS and varies from 1 to 10. The higher the score, the more severe the problem.

Pluses of doing business in India much more than minuses: JCBs Anthony BamfordSpiceJet barred from advance bookings beyond one month
A file photo of Anthony Paul Bamford, chairman of JCB Ltd.
Anthony Paul Bamford, The Lord Bamford, DL , the 69-year-old chairman of JCB Ltd , set up his company’s first overseas plant in India in 1979, which he sees as an inspired decision; few companies would have contemplated setting up a business in India back then.
Today, JCB is a generic name for earth-moving equipment in India, in the same way that Xerox is associated with photocopying and Unilever Plc ’s Surf is synonymous with detergents. Last week, Bamford announced investment of Rs.500 crore to set up a manufacturing facility in Jaipur, the firm’s fourth in India. Bamford believes Prime Minister Narendra Modi could do to India what Margaret Thatcher did to England. In an interview, he spoke about creating an environment where a family business can be run comfortably by professionals and reasons for not diversifying his company’s business. He spoke about ease of doing business in India and why he never complains about the country. Edited excerpts:
When did you first come to India? Which year was it?
I think it was 1966 when I was 21. I had a backpack and long hair. I travelled around your country then and I have been coming back ever since. That visit had nothing to with business. I was a young man and had just joined my father in his business. We never thought of having a business in India at all. We had a tiny business in the UK.
What prompted you to start doing business here?
We started in India with a partnership with the Nanda family of Escorts Ltd (Editor’s Note: Both partners parted ways in 2002 when JCB bought out the New Delhi-based company’s stake in the joint venture for an undisclosed sum).
We started because there was a particular man, who worked for us in England who had been in India just at the start of the war and kept telling me you should do business in India. I met the Nanda family, Hari Nanda , father of Rajan Nanda and we started it (a joint venture). It was a very slow beginning. Escorts made tractors and were principally in farming business and (later) they branched out in all sort of things.
But, you never complained about India, the system out here.
Every country has differences. What is to complain about? Your country is a wonderful country, and I certainly see more positives than I see negatives. If you look at how difficult was it to do business in the early 1970s in India when everything was licensed or rationed...now your country is very modern and you have a bureaucracy and that is starting to be energized. I get that feeling. You have got Mr. Modi who works so many hours a day. You have got a very, very active prime minister. A person makes a difference. My country, Great Britain, was transformed by a woman—Mrs. Thatcher. She transformed it. Of course, she had a lot of good people with her but it was her will that did it. So, a person can make a lot of difference and you have got a very positive man running your country.
Did you find out a way to get work done here or did you simply accept the way things happen here?
To be honest, we believe in your country. Come what may, we believe in India. As for red tape, every country in the world has red tape. I have never complained about India and I would not because the pluses are much more than the minuses. People smile in India. They are not miserable. That’s what I find very attractive.
As a businessman, why have you not diversified JCB?
We have not. You are right. We are in engineering, construction machinery, agriculture machinery and industrial machinery. We have over 300 basic products and they go on from $2,000 to a million dollars. So, it’s a big spread of products. We haven’t gone into other things. We are not a public company. I haven’t thought (about) the need to diversify. If you are a public company, your quarterly figures are highly important and you have to keep showing an increase, and if not, you get damned. One of the ways to do that is by buying counter (cyclical) businesses, which have got different cycles (than your own) and it is not what we want to do.
But, you did express your interest in buying Jaguar in 2006.
Yes, that was a very long time ago. It’s a good British company, which is owned by an Indian (company) now. It has done very well since; particularly Land Rover has done extremely well. Jaguar is doing well but I  think the Tatas have made a fortune by buying Jaguar and Land Rover and I applaud them for that. I think it is a tremendous business decision.
So, was it just out of loyalty to British brands that you wanted to buy Jaguar or did it reflect an attempt to diversify?
In our industry, there are either big people or small people. There are not a lot of medium-sized people. Our sales range between four-and-a-half to $5 billion. There are three or four companies bigger than us. Volvo is slightly bigger than us and there is Komatsu and Caterpillar , which is the biggest.
Caterpillar, in construction machinery, is about $15 billion, three times our size. As a whole, they do $50 billion a year. All I mean is there are not many people to buy. Our model has not been about buying.
What you saw here today (last week in Rajasthan) is a direct investment with our own money with no baggage. There are no bad habits that we have picked up. We prefer to do that rather than buying another business. We don’t have to, being a private company. If we would’ve been a public company, we will have to because, what (else) are you going to do in a downside. If there is a downside, we carry on investing. We believe in our future.
You also seem to have exported talent out of India?
What you might find interesting is the president of our American company is an Indian and he is from Jaipur. He was the head of service and sales here in India. The head of our excavators business is an Indian from Pune and he is based in England. So, we promote from within. Not always, but if we can. Your management in India is of the highest order. We have a wonderful team here. The only expats are particular experts on their subjects, and they are not in control of any operations.
How do you strike a balance in a business run by professionals but controlled by the family?
We have an executive (body) which meets every week and it has some overseas members like Vipin (Sondhi, managing director, JCB India), and we have monthly meetings as well and I am very rarely there. I am active in daily business somewhat but honestly, it is run by professional people, who are not there because of nepotism.
The only nepotism in the business is myself and my 35-year-old son, who runs two of our businesses.

US: Right-to-die advocates mom blasts VaticanremarksIn this file photo, Brittany Maynard, left, hugs her mother Debbie Ziegler.
By: Associated Press | Portland | Posted: November 19, 2014 6:06 am
The mother of a right-to-die advocate responded angrily to criticism from the Vatican of Brittany Maynard’s decision to end her life early under an Oregon law written to let terminally ill patients die on their own terms.
Days after Maynard’s November 1 death at age 29, the Vatican’s top bioethics official called her choice “reprehensible” and said physician-assisted suicide should be condemned.
Maynard’s mother, Debbie Ziegler, issued a sharp written response Tuesday. She said the comments from Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, came as the family was grieving and were “more than a slap in the face.”
Her response was made through Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group that Maynard worked with in her last days.
Maynard suffered from terminal brain cancer and in the spring was given six months to live. She moved to Oregon from Northern California with her husband and parents because Oregon allows terminally ill patients to die using lethal medications prescribed by a doctor.
Maynard used her story to speak out for the right of the terminally ill to end their lives on their own terms. A media campaign by her and Compassion & Choices sparked a national debate.
Five US states allow patients to seek aid in dying: Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico.
Some religious groups and social conservatives, including the American Life League, also have criticized Maynard’s decision.
Pope Francis denounced the right-to-die movement Saturday, saying euthanasia is a sin against God and creation. Thinking of euthanasia as an act of dignity provides a “false sense of compassion,” Francis said. He didn’t refer specifically to Maynard’s case.
In the letter, Ziegler called her terminally ill daughter’s decision to die a human rights issue. Maynard’s family has since moved back to California.
“My twenty-nine-year-old daughter’s choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation,” Ziegler wrote.
Ziegler encouraged people to consider all the options when faced with an incurable, debilitating, painful disease.
“The ‘culture of cure’ has led to a fairy tale belief that doctors can always fix our problems,” she wrote.
On Thursday, the day Maynard would have turned 30, Compassion & Choices plans to release a video she made before her death. The group also will call for expanded laws that allow the terminally ill to end their lives.
Oregon was the first state to make it legal for a doctor to prescribe a life-ending drug to a terminally ill patient of sound mind who makes the request. The patient must swallow the drug without help; it is illegal for a doctor to administer it.
More than 750 people in Oregon had used the law to die as of December 31, 2013. The median age continued…

Israel shaken by five deaths  vows harsh response to synagogueattackIsrael vowed harsh retaliation Tuesday for a Palestinian attack that killed five people.
By: Associated Press | Jerusalem | Posted: November 19, 2014 5:13 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 4:02 pm
Israel vowed harsh retaliation Tuesday for a Palestinian attack that killed five people and left blood-smeared prayer books and shawls on the floor of a synagogue in Jerusalem – an assault that sharply escalated already-high tensions after weeks of religious violence.
The attack during morning prayers in the west Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof was carried out by two Palestinian cousins wielding meat cleavers, knives and a handgun. They were shot to death by police after the deadliest assault in the holy city since 2008.
Four of the dead were rabbis and one was a police officer who died of his wounds hours after the attack. Three of the rabbis were born in the United States and the fourth was born in England, although all held dual Israeli citizenship. Five others were wounded.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack, the first time he has done so in the wave of deadly violence against Israelis. But he also called for an end to Israeli “provocations” surrounding Jerusalem’s shrines that are sacred to both Muslims and Jews.
President Barack Obama called the attack “horrific” and without justification, urging cooperation from both sides to ease tensions and adding that too many Israelis and Palestinians have died in recent months,
Tuesday’s attack, however, appeared to mark a turning point, with the gruesome scene in a house of worship shocking a nation long accustomed to violence.
The government released a photo of a meat cleaver it said came from the crime scene. Government video showed blood-soaked prayer books and prayer shawls in the synagogue. A pair of glasses lay under a table, and thick streaks of blood smeared the floor.
“I saw people lying on the floor, blood everywhere,” said Yosef Posternak, who was at the synagogue in the quiet neighborhood that has a large community of English-speaking immigrants.
“People were trying to fight with (the attackers) but they didn’t have much of a chance,” Posternak told Israel Radio.
In one of Israel’s first acts of retaliation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the demolitions of the homes of the attackers. But halting further violence could prove to be a tough challenge as police confront a new threat: Lightly armed assailants from annexed east Jerusalem who hold residency rights that allow them to move freely throughout the country.
Netanyahu condemned the deaths of the “innocent and pure Jews.” In a nationally televised address, he accused Abbas of inciting the recent violence and said the Palestinian leader’s condemnation of the attack was insufficient.
Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs the Gaza Strip, praised the attack. In Gaza, dozens celebrated in the streets, with some offering trays full of candy.
The U.S.-born victims were identified as Moshe Twersky, 59, Aryeh Kupinsky, 43, and Kalman Levine, 55. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the British man was Avraham Goldberg, 68, who immigrated to Israel continued…

FM asks People to increase their Domestic SavingsFM asks People to increase their Domestic Savings
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | November 18, 2014 17:59 IST
The Finance Minister said that in last few years due to slower rate of economic growth, the rate of domestic savings had come below 30 % while it had once touched the peak of 36.8%. He stressed the urgent need for raising the domestic rate of savings.
 
 
The Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley asks the people to increase their domestic savings and invest the same in small savings schemes like Kisan Vikas Patras (KVPs). He said that money invested therein is being used for undertaking various development activities in the country for the benefit of the people at large. The Finance Minister said that in last few years due to slower rate of economic growth, the rate of domestic savings had come below 30 % while it had once touched the peak of 36.8%. He stressed the urgent need for raising the domestic rate of savings. The Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley said that the people need to be careful from privately run ponzi schemes which are both unsafe and risky even though offering little higher rate of interest. 
He said that this many times also results in loss of their hard earned income. He said that they may rather go for the Government run small savings schemes which are safe, simple and easy to access.. The Finance Minister said that on the other hand, in order to attract the small savings of the people, the Government should bring-out from time to time attractive small savings schemes befitting the needs of different sections of society especially the poor people. He said that these schemes should not only be simple and safe but also give best possible returns to the people on their investment. He said this is one of the reasons that's why we have re-launched the Kisan Vikas Patras (KVPs) today. He said that this would also give a direction to bank and unbank savings of the people This scheme is open to everyone including the farmers. The Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley was speaking after re-launching the Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP) scheme at a function. 
He said that investment in KVP would become double in 100 months. He hoped that those who want to increase their savings and get good returns on the same, would make best use of the KVP. He said that this will not only help the investors but also the society at large He said that initially this scheme would be operated through post offices but later would be operated through banks as well. He distributed the Certificates to various persons including Ms Santosh who was the First woman to buy KVP and Shri Har Prakash, the first man to buy KVP among others on this occasion. 
Earlier speaking on the occasion Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister for Communication and IT said that saving money is part of our habit and culture. He said that we need a financial instrument which is safe to attract the savings of the people. He said that there is a special attachment to KVPs especially of the poor people and farmers. He said that it is not only an instrument of savings but the farmers have also an emotional attachment with it. He said that he doesn't understand why this scheme was discontinued .He said that he is happy that Postal Department and small savings are linked together for years. He said that there are more than 30 crore 8 lakh postal account holders in the country and more than 60 small saving schemes are being operated through the Postal Department. He said that there are more than 1.54 thousand postal centres in the country which can be best suited for implementing the programmes relating to financial inclusion especially in rural areas. He further added that there is a need for Postal Department to reincarnate itself in a new format to meet the changing needs of the people at large. 
Shri Rajiv Mehrishi, Finance Secretary, Ms. Kavita, Secretary, Department of Posts, Shri Rajat Bhargava, Joint Secretary (Budget), Department of Economic Affairs (DEA),Ministry of Finance and other senior officers of the Ministry of Finance and Department of Posts and National Small Savings Organizations were also present among others on this occasion. 

The next ad frontier: Brain scans  eye sensors from NielsenCisco partners with ILFS Technologies to develop projects for smart cities
This may sound like science fiction, but it isn’t. Market research firm Nielsen India has announced the launch of its first neuroscience lab in the country to gauge consumer attention and brand engagement by measuring brainwaves. The first lab will be set up in Mumbai followed by Delhi.
The lab will measure brainwaves and track eye movements to provide a real-time picture of consumers’ subconscious reactions to brand messages. It will use two techniques to capture the reactions — electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking sensors. The EEG method will use non-invasive caps that will measure brain activity while the eye-tracking sensors will study the movement of pupils.
While marketers will define the target group, Nielsen will conduct the research. The research involves individuals wearing special headgear held together by gels and wires and viewing videos or visuals in a closed room. The data captured in the headgear is then downloaded for analysis.
The research, according to Nielsen, will be useful across the marketing spectrum — from ads to aisles and from food to finance. Neuroscience can help in the areas of ad effectiveness, product design, in-store marketing, experiential marketing etc, said the market research company.
It already runs such labs in the UK, Germany, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Japan, the US and China.
Nielsen has already been providing neurological solutions in some measure to its clients in India and with the full-fledged lab plans to commence the exercise on a large scale. Joe Willke, president, Nielsen Neuro, said that neuroscience has penetrated fields such as economy, sociology and psychology. “Marketing communications is, in fact, the last bastion. If a television ad commercial is pre-tested and consumer reaction to it gauged before its final launch, it could help in optimising marketing spends by at least 5-10% and that’s a huge saving for companies alongside helping them tailor their communication for the intended purpose,” Willke said. “This kind of diagnosis is just not possible with traditional market research tools.”
“With these technologies, we can measure attention on a second-by-second basis,” Willke said, adding that big advertising and marketing spenders such as auto, financial services and telecom have already adopted neuroscience for market research.
Sanjay Tripathy, executive vice-president and head, marketing, product, digital & e-commerce, HDFC Life, said that as a marketer, he is excited about the possibilities offered by neuromarketing. Arguing that most purchase decisions are taken unconsciously and, hence, parameters such as behaviour, attention, cognition, emotion, perception, etc, are acquiring a new place in business-related matters and specifically in brand marketing, he said: “Consumer neuroscience, if executed with diligence, is the future of market research.”
Mediacom, a media agency owned by WPP, too, has a tool called Real World Street, which works on the same principle.
Even as the experiments in neuroscience marketing gain ground, marketers are treading the path cautiously. Santosh Desai, managing director and chief executive at Future Brands, said neuroscience is a bit ‘dodgy’. “There are ethical issues in this form of research since it bypasses the normal cognitive process and delves into the subconscious,” he said.

French President Hollande condemns terrifying JerusalemattackFive Israelis were killed in the rare assault on a place of worship when two Palestinians armed with a gun
By: Agence-France Presse | Canberra | Posted: November 19, 2014 9:11 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 10:41 am
French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday condemned the “terrifying” attack on a synagogue in West Jerusalem, urging Israel and the Palestinians to resume talks seeking peace.
Five Israelis were killed in the rare assault on a place of worship when two Palestinians armed with a gun and meat cleavers ran amok among worshippers yesterday, sending shockwaves through the country.
“Yesterday there was an attack on a synagogue in Jerusalem which was particularly terrifying…and this is unfortunately the trend in terms of what’s happening,” Hollande said in Australia during a state visit.
“So we must be very clear that we condemn these sort of actions. This is something that occurred in a place of worship. We must act to ensure that violence in Jerusalem ceases, and that conditions for resuming talks may finally be such that this dialogue can occur,” he added.
Four of the victims were Israelis with dual nationality – three US citizens and a Briton, police said. Israel’s leading ultra-Orthodox website said they were all rabbis. A policeman also died of his wounds.

India extends $75-mn line of credit to FijiIndia extends $75-mn line of credit to Fiji
PTI
Tweet
Suva, Nov 19:  
Seeking stronger engagement with the Pacific Islands, India today announced a $75-million line of credit for Fiji for a co-generation power plant and upgrading the sugar industry and also a $5-million fund to develop its villages even as the two countries agreed to expand their defence and security cooperation.
Visa on arrival, assistance projects
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made these announcements after talks with his Fijian counterpart Frank Bainimarama shortly after his arrival, also announced a visa on arrival for Fijians and assistance projects that included a parliament library and doubling the scholarships and training slots in India for people from this country.
The lines of credit were part of three agreements signed between the two countries in the presence of the two leaders.
Modi arrived here at the crack of dawn on the third and final leg of his 10-day three-nation tour, for a day-long visit, the first by an Indian premier to the country in 33 years after Indira Gandhi in 1981.
The tiny remote pacific Island nation rolled out the red carpet for Modi, who was received by Frank Bainimarama, a former military ruler, at the Suva International airport.
Bainimarama was sworn in as Prime Minister on September 22 after the first parliamentary elections in the Pacific nation since he seized power in a coup in 2006.
Modi was accorded a ceremonial guard of honour at the airport after which he attended the traditional ceremony of Welcome at Albert park, close to the Prime Minister’s office and Parliament.
He shook hands with people from the Indian diaspora assembled at the ground as he walked past the enclosures.
“It is a new day and a new beginning in our relations with Fiji,” Modi said in remarks to the media at a joint appearance with Bainimarama at the prime Minister’s office.
“Fiji could serve as a hub for stronger Indian engagement with Pacific islands. I see this visit as an opportunity to renew an old relationship and lay the foundation for a strong partnership in the future,” he added.
'Digital Fiji'
Modi also addressed the Fijian Parliament, the first by a foreign leader, after parliamentary elections, during which he said that India was prepared to work with Fiji to build a “Digital Fiji’’.
The line of credit included $70-million for a co-generation power plant at Rarav sugar mill and $5 million to strengthen and modernise Fiji’s village, small and medium-scale industries.
“I regard Fiji as an important partner for India. We have deep and enduring ties of history and culture. Fiji is an influential voice in the Pacific Region and the developing world, and our partner in multilateral institutions,” Modi said at his joint press interaction.

Not just Hindalco  SPP red-flagged other coal cases to CBI chief'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
Last week, the Supreme Court-appointed Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) in the coal scam cases, senior advocate Rajinder Singh Cheema, challenged the CBI’s line on the ongoing probe related to the allocation of Talabira II coal blocks in Orissa to Hindalco, owned by the Kumar Mangalam Birla group. He said that \there was “prima facie” material against “private parties” and “some government officials” to take cognisance of offences.
Hindalco isn’t the only case where Cheema questioned the agency.
Sources have confirmed to The Indian Express that since he took over as SPP in August, Cheema has written at least six strongly worded letters to CBI director Ranjit Sinha. Most of these pertain to what he calls “sketchy” closure reports filed by the agency in the coal block cases; others urged Sinha to be “more transparent” with the court. After his letters, at least three closure reports have been reviewed. These deal with cases related to JAS Infrastructure and Power Ltd; Hindalco and Navbharat Power Private Ltd.
Cheema is also learnt to have questioned the CBI’s decision to not arraign some persons without offering any cogent reason.
“In his letters, he (Cheema) has pointed to the fact that in many cases the closure reports filed by us are sketchy, only contain a gist of the FIR and end with a laconic conclusion that the allegations have not been substantiated.
He has told the Director that unless and until the entire relevant data is made available to the court, the agency could be faulted for not being transparent. In such an eventuality, the court may delve deep into case diaries and crime files, something that is permissible but is not ordinarily required,” a senior CBI functionary told The Indian Express.
In one such letters, Cheema has highlighted what he calls guidelines the CBI should follow in closure reports: give detailed information about allegation and evidence — oral as well as documentary — which could substantiate the allegation; evidence which renders the case unfit for prosecution; and, lastly, the reason for closure.
Cheema is learnt to have told the CBI chief that in case the court refuses to accept the CBI’s closure report, it would become practically impossible to effectively prosecute the accused in the absence of relevant material.
Incidentally, following the strong stand taken by Cheema in some cases where the probe agency sought closure, the CBI special judge refused to accept the agency’s closure reports.
In one such case — CBI versus Vikash Metal and Power Ltd — special judge Bharat Parashar came down heavily on the CBI. “I am rather constrained to observe that investigation in the present matter has been carried out in a clandestine manner and the final report of the CBI rather appears to be the document purporting to be a plea of defence of the accused persons rather then the report of an investigation agency.”
When asked about Cheema’s letters with the agency, CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad said: “This is correspondence between a client and its counsel and so is privileged. Therefore, it won’t be appropriate to comment.”

Study will test survivors blood to treatEbolaPhoto shows a mobile donation unit being loaded onto a plane at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in Raleigh, N.C. The unit was headed to Liberia for use in a study of blood plasma treatment for Ebola patients. (Source: AP)
Posted: November 19, 2014 9:52 am
A coalition of companies and aid groups announced plans Tuesday to test experimental drugs and collect blood plasma from Ebola survivors to treat new victims of the disease in West Africa.
Plasma from survivors contains antibodies, substances the immune system makes to fight the virus. Several Ebola patients have received survivor plasma and recovered, but doctors say there is no way to know whether it really helps without a study like the one they are about to start within a month.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is giving $5.7 million to scale up production of the treatments for the project in Guinea and other Ebola-affected countries in Africa.  More than a dozen companies, universities and others are contributing supplies, staff and cash, and are working with the countries and the World Health Organization on specific procedures and locations.
Besides helping Ebola patients now, plasma “could be a tool for a future epidemic as well” from different viruses, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.
“You might not have drugs and vaccines for some new thing” and it would be good to have capabilities in place to collect and give plasma to fill the gap until those other tools can be developed, he said.
There are no drugs or vaccines approved now for Ebola, which has killed more than 5,000 people this year in West Africa, most of them in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Doctors Without Borders last week also said it would host studies of experimental treatments and plasma at three of its West Africa treatment centers.
The drugs to be tested by both groups include brincidofovir, an antiviral medicine that has been tried in a few Ebola cases so far. Its maker, North Carolina-based Chimerix Inc., developed it to treat other types of viruses and lab tests suggest it might help fight Ebola.
“We said to them, ‘well, if money was no constraint, how much could you make?’ and they gave us a number,” Gates said. “So we said, ‘OK, we’ll take the risk that maybe nobody will ever buy this from you. So we’ll help you scale up the manufacturing.”’
Making plasma available is a complex task. Plasma is the clear part of blood, and the part that contains antibodies. In Africa, donors’ blood will be filtered through a machine to remove small amounts of plasma and return the rest of the blood to the donor _ a process that allows someone to donate as often as every two weeks.

Reciprocating Modi’s sentiments, Bainimarama said the Indian Prime minister’s visit has laid the groundwork for “productive relationship” between the two countries.
“We are proud to have India as a partner in Fiji’s future,” he said, adding that 15 more bilateral agreements are in the works.
Modi touched a chord at all his events starting his speeches with a Fijian greeting “Nissan Vola” and ending them with “Vinaka” (Thank You).
“We will also expand our defence and security cooperation, including assistance in defence training and capacity building. We agreed to identify opportunities to expand our trade and investments and work out a concrete roadmap,” Modi said.
He said that India looks forward to closer engagement in areas like information technology and Space applications.
“I want to offer to convey a special word of gratitude from the people of India for hosting Indian scientists for tracking India’s Mars Mission earlier this year. Together we made history,” the prime minister said.
“We are also prepared to increase cooperation in renewable energy, especially solar and wind energy, and in building capacity to adapt to climate change,” he added.
He also suggested Fijian leaders to invite Bollywood to shoot their films in Fiji to attract more Indian tourists.
“Fiji is a leader in the region and a strong voice in the developing world. Together, we can also work for a future in the region, in which there is an equal place for all nations – big and small, developed and developing – and a climate of peace and tranquility,” he added.

Protest against delay in free cycle distribution
A section of parents along with activists of the Students Federation of India (SFI) on Tuesday laid siege to the Kamarajar Government Boys Higher Secondary School in Muthialpet near here protesting the inordinate delay in distribution of free cycles to students under a government scheme.
SFI secretary A. Anand who led the protest alleged that the school authorities had returned the batches of free cycles sent by the Department of Social Welfare to the school.
As a result 121 students of class X in the school were yet to receive the free cycles. The benefit of the scheme was getting affected due to the lackadaisical approach of the authorities, he said.
D. Arunachalam, headmaster, said that the authorities received the supply of bicycles meant for distribution to around 121 students of class X who had studied in the school during 2012-13. However, a majority of them have joined class XI in various other schools in the city.
“We are working towards the distribution of free cycles to all the students. The free cycles were returned to the Department of Social Welfare due to lack of adequate facilities in the school to keep them,” he said.

Rupee slips to 61.84 on strong dollar demandRupee slumps to 61.96 on dollar demand from oil importers
Our Bureau/PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Nov 19:  
After touching 62 levels against the dollar on Wednesday, the rupee ended at about 8-month low of 61.96 due to capital outflows ahead of the release of US Federal Reserve meeting’s minutes and falling oil prices.
The domestic unit had closed at 61.74 per dollar on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, the unit opened 10 paise weaker at 61.84 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market.
After gaining slightly to 61.78, the rupee continued to slide to 62 levels led by capital outflows into the domestic equity markets and demand for the American currency from oil importers on account of falling global oil prices.
BSE-benchmark Sensex ended 130 points lower at 28,032.85, weaker by 0.46 per cent over its previous close.
However, ahead of uncertainty, the rupee recovered 4 paise to end at 61.96 per dollar.
The rupee is likely to trade with a downward bias after the US Federal Reserve’s minutes that would be released later on Wednesday.
Call Rates fall; Bonds yields up marginally
The inter-bank call money rate, the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from one another, ended weaker at 7.60 per cent from Tuesday’s close of 7.85 per cent. Intraday, the call money market moved between 7.10 to 8.25 per cent range.
Yield on the 10-year benchmark 8.40 per cent government security, maturing in 2024, hardened a tad to 8.16 per cent from 8.15 per cent. The price of the bond fell marginally to Rs 101.54 as against a close of Rs 101.61 on Tuesday.

Sensex off from new record-high of 28 294Sensex sheds 130 points; metal, power stocks trip
Our Bureau/Agencies
Tweet
Mumbai, Nov 19:  
The Sensex and the Nifty fell nearly 0.5 per cent at the closing session on Wednesday on heavy selling in metal, power and PSU sector stocks amid weak global cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex ended down by 130.44 points at 28,032.85 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty fell 43.6 points to close at 8,382.30.
Sectoral indices
Among BSE sectoral indices, metal index fell the most by 2.14 per cent, followed by power 1.8 per cent and PSU 1.51 per cent and India infrastructure index 1.44 per cent. On the other hand, IT index was down 0.21 per cent, followed by TECk 0.12 per cent and healthcare 0.07 per cent.
Gainers, losers
Dr Reddy's, HUL, HDFC, Bajaj Auto and Bharti Airtel were the top five Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Tata Steel, SSLT, GAIL, Tata Motors and BHEL.
The benchmark BSE Sensex climbed to a new record-high of 28,294.01 in the opening trade today as investors indulged in enlarging positions amid continued overseas capital inflows and positive economic data.
The 30-share index, which had shed 14.59 points in yesterday’s trade, bounced back by 130.72 points or 0.46 per cent to trade at a fresh record-high of 28,294.01 points, breaching the previous peak of 28,282.85 touched in yesterday’s trade.
Similarly, the National Stock Exchange index Nifty spurted by 29.75 points or 0.35 per cent to scale a new peak of 8,455.65, surpassing its earlier record-high of 8,454.50, touched yesterday.
Brokers said the trading sentiment remained upbeat in early trade on sustained buying by foreign funds and retail investors, supported by economic reforms undertaken by the government, easing inflation and falling global crude oil prices.
European stocks
European shares inched lower in early trade on Wednesday, with mining shares dragged by a sharp fall in iron ore prices and nuclear group Areva sinking after it dropped its financial targets.
Shares in France's Areva tumbled 19 per cent after it suspended its 2015 and 2016 financial targets, blaming delays to a Finnish nuclear project, the slow restart of Japan's reactors and a lacklustre nuclear market.
At 0807 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.3 per cent at 1,356.86 points.
Asian shares
Japanese shares gave up early gains on Wednesday as investors booked profits after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe delayed a tax hike and said he would call a snap election to seek a fresh mandate for his economic policies.
Asian shares slipped to a three-week low as resource shares were hit by fall in oil and other commodity prices and as Chinese shares lost momentum as investors continued to take profits after Monday's launch of the landmark Hong Kong-Shanghai trading link.

Windscreen of IndiGo aircraft to carry Aviation Minister cracks before take-offIn New York, Arvind Kejriwal says AAP set for face-off with BJP in Delhi elections
A Delhi-bound IndiGo aircraft, scheduled to fly Union Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju and other passengers, developed a windscreen crack minutes before its take-off from Nagpur airport this evening.
Raju, who visited Nagpur earlier in the day, was waiting to board the 8 PM (6E-202) flight when the crack was noticed.
Nagpur airport officials have confirmed the development, saying the minister had not boarded the plane, but was just waiting to board.
When the aircraft landed, its windshield was found cracked, an official of the state-run airport said, requesting anonymity.
The official added that the airline has made an alternative aircraft available. The number of passengers could not be known immediately.

Marley: Marlboro Man of marijuanaContinue reading
His heirs have also traded on his name to launch a number of businesses, including House of Marley, which sells headphones and audio accessories, and Marley Coffee. The family has been caught up over the years in legal battles with each other and with Marley’s record label over control of his assets, image, name and music. The singer died without a will.
The decision to step into the emerging legitimate marijuana market is in keeping with Marley’s long-time advocacy for legalisation and social justice, said Cedella Marley, the singer’s daughter.
“Opinions toward cannabis are changing. People are recognising the benefits of the herb,” she said. “Our father was leading this conversation for 50 years so it’s natural that he’s part of this conversation today.”
Marley Natural products will be sold in countries and jurisdictions where they are legal, including cannabis in some places. Mr Kennedy said he was interested in markets including the Netherlands, Uruguay, Canada, Spain and Israel.
Financial terms of the arrangement were not disclosed, but Marley Natural will be a wholly owned subsidiary within Privateer and the family is participating in Privateer, Mr Kennedy said.
The Marley Natural logo
Privateer has raised $22m through equity funding and a convertible bridge loan. It is in the midst of another funding round, expected to close before the end of this year, that will add another $50m. Its businesses include Tilray, a Canadian medical marijuana producer, and Leafly, an online cannabis ratings site.
The recent liberalisation of US marijuana laws has spurred a rush of companies and investors into the market. The parent company of High Times , the US marijuana magazine, has launched a private equity fund that is aiming to raise $300m to invest in cannabis ventures. Tom Bollich, the co-founder of online gaming group Zynga, has become chief executive of a marijuana growing equipment company.
“The midterm elections sent a clear message that the end of prohibition is a mainstream cause supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans across the political spectrum,” Mr Kennedy said, referring to recent votes in Oregon, Alaska and Washington DC, to allow access to recreational marijuana.
“We see this as a mainstream product, consumed by people around the US and around the world,” he said. “Everybody has a little bit of Bob in their playlist.”

Shell wins Rs 18 000 cr case against I-T deptShell wins Rs 18,000-crore case against I-T dept
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 19, 2014  | 11:21 IST
On the heels of it losing a similar case against telecom major Vodafone , the I-T department lost its Rs 18,000-crore transfer pricing cases against oil firm Shell India at the Bombay High Court, which on Tuesday quashed the department's tax order.
The tax sleuth had added Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 3,000 crore, respectively to the taxable income of Shell India Markets Pvt Ltd, the Indian subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, for the FY 2007-08 and FY 2008-09 in two transfer pricing cases.
The judgement comes in the wake of two similar transfer pricing cases, which were ruled in favour of the Indian subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc, in which the I-T department had sought adjustments of over Rs 4,500 crore last month.
The order in favour of Shell India was passed on Tuesday by a bench of justices M S Sanklecha and S C Gupte on a petition filed by Shell India Markets.
Transfer pricing tax orders of Income Tax against Shell and Vodafone pertain to alleged undervaluation of shares issued by their domestic subsidiaries to the parent companies abroad. Transfer pricing refers to the practice of arm's length pricing for transactions between group companies based in different countries to ensure that a fair price one that would have been charged to an unrelated party is levied.
Shell India had issued 870 million shares to Shell Gas BV in March 2009 at Rs 10 per share. However, the Income Tax department contended that the shares were grossly undervalued and it valued them at Rs 180 per share.
The department then added the difference to the taxable income of Shell India. In a separate development this year, the Income Tax department had issued a show-cause notice adding another Rs 3,100 crore to Shell India's income for FY 2009 in another transfer pricing case. Being aggrieved, the company moved the Bombay High Court challenging the tax notice.
Funding a subsidiary by issuing shares is a common practice among multi-national companies which view this as a capital transaction and out of the transfer pricing bracket. However, the tax department argues that such a deal is a transfer pricing arrangement by which the shares issued are undervalued and hence the company is liable to pay tax on the income generated out of it.
The high court did not agree with the department and quashed its order and show-cause notice against Shell India.

Arpita Khan s wedding:  Dulhan Ka Bhai  Salman Khan and his alleged ex girlfriend Katrina to performPrint
From the guest list to the menu for dinner, the wedding is all about royalty.
Written by Sonal Gera , Edited by Sarika Sharma | New Delhi | Posted: November 18, 2014 6:32 pm | Updated: November 18, 2014 6:43 pm
It’s a big day in the ‘Khandaan’ as their youngest daughter, Arpita Khan, is all set to get married to her long time beau Aayush Sharma. The wedding will take place tonight at the Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad.
Salman Khan and his family have left no stone unturned to make this day the most special in the baby sister’s life. From the guest list to the menu for dinner, the wedding is all about royalty. So, what all can one expect from the D Day? Let’s have a look.
- That’s how the bride to be, Arpita Khan, looks….errrmmm…but from behind. Arpita is wearing this majestic looking off white lehenga.
- The Khan family – Arbaaz, Sohail, Seema, Malaika with their kids, along with Amrita and other close friends have already reached Hyderabad and are all set for the grand bash.
- What’s a wedding without the ‘Dulhan ke bhai’ dancing? The wedding will be made more celebratory with the three Khan brothers – Salman, Arbaaz, Sohail – performing at the wedding, or so we hear.
- The guest list features names like Aamir Khan, Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar, Karan Johar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Subhash Ghai and many others. From down South, Kamal Haasan, Vijay, Chiranjeevi, Venkatesh, Suresh Babu are expected to attend the ceremony. At the time of filing this article, Katrina Kaif had already reached the Hyderabad airport. She is also expected to perform at the wedding.
Actress Priyanka Chopra has also been spotted at the airport with her mother. Whether she will perform at the wedding or not is a mystery.
- Singer Mika Singh is also all set to perform at the wedding. He put a picture of him with Salman Khan on Instagram and captioned, “I have already done so many performances this month..But tonight is going to be a special one with family! My best wishes to dear #Arpita #Aayush and many many congratulations to @BeingSalmanKhan bhai and the entire family.”
- The wedding is slated to take place at the famous and historical Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad. The whole palace had been booked for the family and close friends for about five days, with Rs 2 cr been shelled out on it alone.
- Salman Khan has reportedly invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the wedding reception. He went to invite Modi with his elder sister Alvira Khan. It remains to be seen whether the Prime Minister will attend the ceremonies.
- Interestingly, the groom’s side has invited Sonia Gandhi to the wedding along with Rahul Gandhi and Himachal Pradesh Governor with the entire state cabinet as Aayush happens to be the grandson of former telecommunications minister Sukh Ram and younger son of Himachal Pradesh cabinet minister Anil Sharma. But reportedly, the Congress President is not expected to join in the celebrations.
- Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘kiss’ gesture at Arpita’s sangeet has already amassed a lot of headlines. And we expect many more such awesome ‘Karan Arjun’ moments at other wedding ceremonies. Will we be able to? It’s also reported that the SRK Salman patch up didn’t let Aamir sleep. That’s because the two Khans informed the third Khan about their ‘kiss and make up’ late at night or shall we say very early in the morning.
- Talking about the delicacies, reports say it’s the Hyderabadi cuisine that will dominate the menu today. Hyderabadi Biryani and Haleem can be expected at the buffet.
- Guess who’s doing Arpita’s make up at the ceremonies? Former Miss World Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s (who also happens to be Salman’s ex girlfriend) make up artist Daniel Bauer.
- The latest we hear is Salman has planned to give a 3 BHK terrace flat to his darling sister as her wedding gift. The flat is said to be costing around Rs 16 Cr and is situated in one of the poshest areas of Mumbai – Carter Road. It’s also touted to be very close to Galaxy Apartments – just 5 mins drive – where Salman stays with his family.
What adds to this expenses-no-bar wedding is the hype generated around it. Arpita certainly has the blessings of everybody as she was instrumental in bringing the ‘Karan Arjun’ together and for good. The hashtag #HappyMarriedLifeArpita has been trending on Twitter since morning.
We wish the lucky sister and the couple a happy married life!

Rajinikanth towers over Goa ahead of IFFIBy: Press Trust of India | Panaji | Posted: November 18, 2014 7:24 pm
Giant cut outs of megastar ajinikanth in his superhero costume line the road alongside picturesque Mandovi river as Goa prepares to host annual International Film Festival of India on November 20.
Rajinikanth, 63, will arrive in his chartered plane to attend the IIFI’s inaugural function on Thursday, said Director of Film Festival Shankar Mohan, who along with the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) officials is busy giving final touches to the 45th edition of the event.
Rajinikanth, successful in both Hindi and southern film industry, will be presented the Special Centenary Award for his contribution to cinema during the festival.
Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan will be the special guest for the inauguration ceremony that would be held at Dr Shama Prasad Mukherjee Stadium near Panaji.
Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley will be the chief guest for the function where Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and Union MoS for I&B Rajyavardhan Rathore will also be present.
The inauguration will be compered by veteran actor Anupam Kher and noted actress Raveena Tondon.
“Over the years, IFFI has emerged as a major event on the calendar of international cinema. Undoubtedly, this festival has proven to be a significant platform for the Indian cinema enabling it to emerge as a distinct genre in world cinema,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a message to the festival organisers, as per the IFFI souvenir.
“By showcasing films in different languages and from diverse cultures, IFFI contributes to the important task of breaking down boundaries between nations and cultures,” the message by PM said.
Mohan said this time, the festival organisers have re-started the practice of public screening of movies which was discontinued some years back.
Veteran filmmaker late Richard Attenborough’s ‘Gandhi’ will mark the inauguration of the public screening of films at D B Bandodkar stadium, near Kala Academy.
“The public screening is open for everyone. Anyone can watch the movies. One popular movie would be screened every day so that we involve the common man into the festival,” the director said.
The delegates, who had to brave the humid climate here while queueing up for the tickets, will now have some respite as the organisers have put up air-conditioned tents near the theatres for their convenience.

Arpita Khan s wedding: Sneak peek at her wedding cakePrint
Here's an exclusive glimpse of the wedding cake, which will be cut post the ceremony.
Written by Sunitra Pacheco , Edited by Sarika Sharma | Mumbai | Posted: November 18, 2014 5:22 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 12:05 pm
Salman Khan’s sister Arpita Khan’s grand wedding to her longtime beau Aayush Sharma is the current talk of the town and any wedding is incomplete without a cake.
Here’s an exclusive glimpse of the wedding cake, which was cut post the ceremony. Made by celebrity chef Pooja Dhingra, the cake had a special team of people working on its very intricate minute detailing. The cake weighed almost 150 kgs.
From the picture, we see the cake is a beautiful mint and lilac. It was flown from Mumbai to Hyderabad for the wedding and was assembled at the venue itself.
But that’s not the only sweet treat. The family has ordered boxes and boxes of yum-looking colourful macarons were also given to the guests.
The Khan-daan was seen leaving for the grand affair on Monday (November 17), a day prior to the wedding and is barring no expense for the big day.

Seiko Astron 8X SSE003 review: The GPS watchPrint
This watch could prove to be a great asset for high fliers who end up waking in different time zones.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: November 17, 2014 6:10 pm | Updated: November 17, 2014 6:18 pm
For those of us who travel a lot, getting in sync with the local time can be a bit of a pain. But the Seiko Astron GPS Solar pretty much fixes this problem with the help of some serious technology. And strangely this is not a smartwatch in the sense that we have started understanding the new segment. The Astron at least looks like a very old fashioned time piece.
Price: Rs 1,95,000
Design
As I said the Astron looks like a old fashioned watch, though a very stylish one at that. It has a full metal body, but is still lightweight. That is because the case and band are made of titanium. With a super hard coating the case as well as the glass look like they will be able to weather some serious wear and tire. Along with the crown, there are four buttons on different sides of the case for different uses. The Lumbrite embedded hour and minute dials are very prominent. There are three more dials in the watch face to be used as a stopwatch. The third of these also helps indicate the charge status and whether the watch is getting GPS reception.
Performance
Every time you take the watch out of the box it takes a few second to calibrate itself to the local time. From the light falling on it, the watch can understand whether it is indoors or in a place where it can lock on to the satellites above to adjust time. If you are travelling to a different time zone, you just need to press the top button on the left for 6 seconds for the watch to lock on to the GPS and correct to the local time. I could not test this feature as I was in the same time zone throughout the review period, but I trust this watch to get that right.
However, I found it almost impossible to set the time on my own. Every time you pull the dial out and turn, the hands start moving on their own. Then I realised that this was the manual time zone selection where I could use the second hand to select the zone from the locations marked in the outer ring of the watch. I used this to easily select Delhi and that watch was back in sync soon.
Yes, without the manual you will be almost lost in time with this timepiece. But once you get the hang of it, the Astron is very easy to use. In fact, you don’t need to do any manual calibration while using this watch daily.
Plus, the watch does not need a battery and uses solar energy to charge up. On a full charge it can last up to six months, but it would be a good idea leaving it near a window (a secure one, however) once in a while.
Verdict
This watch could prove to be a great asset for high fliers who end up waking in different time zones. While your body clock with struggle to adjust to the time, the Seiko Astron will have no such issues and will adjust automatically to the time zone.

Fake ID trio  on radar in Sunanda case'Fake ID trio' on radar in Sunanda case
Mail Today –  Tue 18 Nov, 2014

South District police investigating the death of Sunanda Pushkar, the wife of former Union minister Shashi Tharoor, have learned that three people with fake passports were staying in the Leela Palace Hotel where she died from January 13 to January 18.
Investigators are now trying to uncover details of these three people.
A team of three police officers, including an ACP rank officer, is preparing to go to Dubai to get some more details about Sunanda. An officer in the investigating team told Mail Today that the south district police have started their probe.
After recovering the bed sheet and carpet on which fluid marks were found and broken glass from suite number 345 of the hotel, the police examined the visitors’ book.
“After scanning the visitors’ book, police came to know that three people were staying in the Leela Palace Hotel from January 13 to January 18 after submitting forged passport details,” the officer said.
He added that there are now no authentic details about these three because they had reportedly told the hotel staff that they were from a foreign country.
Sources said that a special team from the south district is also coordinating with the foreign regional registration office (FRRO), which comes under the Intelligence Bureau.
The Delhi Police are also considering sending the viscera samples linked to Sunanda to forensic laboratories abroad to determine the type of poison suspected to have caused her death.
The AIIMS medical board had, in its second report submitted to the police, confirmed poisoning as the reason behind her death - but did not mention the type of poison.
The board had listed some kinds of poison, many of which were radioactive isotopes that cannot be detected by labs in India.
Three mobile phones and a laptop belonging to Sunanda have already been sent to a forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, for investigation to check whether anything was deleted from the gadgets after her death.

BJP-ruled states slow in linking Jan Dhan with AadhaarPrint
Written by Sandeep Singh | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:09 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 9:49 am
Even as PM Narendra Modi has made the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) a flagship programme of his government, BJP-ruled states seem to be lagging behind in linking these accounts with Aadhaar — the first step towards enabling direct benefit transfers.
Among the large states which accounted for over 10 lakh Jan Dhan accounts as on November 12, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh top the list, with 65 per cent or more accounts already linked to the beneficiaries’ Aadhaar details. No BJP-ruled state, barring Maharashtra where the party just came to power, comes among the top five states.
Instead, the BJP-ruled states are among the worst. While only 9.8 per cent of Jan Dhan accounts were integrated with Aadhaar in Chhattisgarh, the figure stood at 22.1 per cent in Gujarat, 34.3 per cent in Madhya Pradesh and 39.6 per cent in Rajasthan. Only Goa has completed Aadhaar seeding of over 55 per cent.
In two states which recorded the maximum number of Jan Dhan accounts — Uttar Pradesh (1.25 crore) and West Bengal (54 lakh), the accounts linked to Aadhaar add up to just 10.7 per cent and 14.9 per cent, respectively. In Bihar, where 47 lakh accounts have been opened, the figure stands at 8.4 per cent.
                                                           TOP FIVE STATES
Experts feel that while the government has done a good job in getting the accounts opened, linking them with identifiers like Aadhaar is important. “Getting a bank account is just one step, you have to get your Aadhaar number seeded in your core banking system and then in a mapper that links the bank account to Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) and Aadhaar,” said an expert, requesting anonymity. He added that the
Finance Ministry was laying stress on getting everything digitised and integrated.
Since its launch in August-end, over 7.3 crore Jan Dhan accounts have been opened, of which 2.3 crore accounts (31.4 per cent) have already been linked with Aadhaar.
An official said besides Jan Dhan, other accounts too have been integrated with Aadhaar. The total number of Aadhaar- linked bank accounts stands at around 9 crore. Unique Identification Authority of India has, however, issued over 70 crore Aadhaar numbers till date.

Bid to kidnap top pharma company official atgun-pointBy: Press Trust of India | Hyderabad | Posted: November 19, 2014 10:35 am
An AK-47 rifle wielding man allegedly tried to abduct Aurobindo Pharma’s Director K Nityananda Reddy from his car near a park and opened fire when Reddy and his brother resisted in the posh Banjara Hills on Wednesday morning.
No one was injured in the incident that spread panic in the upscale area. Police said the attacker fled leaving behind his weapon.
“One person tried to kidnap him (Reddy). However, he resisted his attempt. Following this, the person fired in air and also at his car. Three rounds were fired in the process before he fled the scene,” Assistant Commissioner of Police, Banjara Hills, Uday Kumar Reddy said.
According to an eyewitness, the unidentified attacker sat in Reddy’s car and then threatened him with an AK-47 rifle. However, Reddy’s brother, who was sitting in the car’s rear seat, tried to resist the attacker’s attempt. In the scuffle, the attacker fired some rounds at the car’s windshield.
Later, the weapon was seized from the car, police said.
Reddy, who is Vice Chairman of Aurobindo Pharma, said after finishing his morning walk at KBR Park in Hyderabad, he sat in his car and was about to start it when the attack took place.
“Suddenly this man came and threatened me with the gun. I tried to catch hold of the weapon and also shouted for help and my brother tried to catch him. The person fired some rounds at my car before fleeing,” Reddy told reporters after the incident.
Police recovered a few empty shells from the site. Sniffer and tracking dogs were pressed into action to nab the attacker.

Two teens arrested for TCS techie murder inBangalorePrint
By: Express News Service | Bangalore | Posted: November 19, 2014 10:23 am
Two 17-year-olds have been arrested by the Bangalore police for the murder of their friend a 33-year-old software engineer from Kerala. The two youths who hailed from Uttar Pradesh allegedly murdered the techie over a financial dispute in East Bangalore on November 5. The victim Prajeeth Anand was a software engineer with TCS in Bangalore. He was found lying dead by the side of a road around three km from his house after he had stepped out of his home to meet his friends on November 5. Police had suspected the role of the youths one of whom was the techie’s neighbour since they found him to be missing from his home following the murder. A search had been launched for the youths and the police tracked them down to Gorakhpur in UP last week.
The police investigation has revealed that four persons including a neighbor of the techie killed him because he had been demanding the return of money he had spent on them. The main accused in the case the police said is a 17-year-old neighbor of the software engineer. The youth had become a good friend of the techie and had borrowed Rs 35,000 in cash from him. He had also gone with Prajeeth Anand on tours along with his friends where the costs of the trip were borne by the techie.  According to the police Prajeeth Anand began pestering the youths to repay him for the expenses incurred on their tours and the money one of them had borrowed. He also allegedly threatened to tell the parents of the youths about the matter. The youths allegedly plotted the murder as a result.
According to the police the youths called Prajeeth Anand out of his house around 8.30 PM on the night of November 5 and murdered him by slitting his throat with a knife. During investigations police found that the techie had received a phone call from one of the youths before he stepped out of his house. The investigations lead the police to the trail of four youths including two pre-university students. Police said that two of the youths linked to the murder were still at large.

Better amenities at stations, time-bound completion of projects part of demand
Improvements in passenger amenities in stations, time-bound action plan for completion of gauge conversion works, restoration of some trains and introduction of new trains were among the host of issues raised by the Members of Parliament at a meeting organised by the Southern Railway here on Tuesday.
The participating Members of Parliament placed their respective wish lists during the course of the meeting that was convened by the Southern Railway General Manager Rakesh Misra at the Zonal Railway Training Centre.
The principal heads of various railway departments and senior Tiruchi railway divisional officers were present at the nearly three-hour long meeting in which 25 Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs from Tiruchi and Madurai railway divisions participated.
Raising a host of issues, Tiruchi MP P.Kumar sought doubling of the Villupuram-Kanyakumari section as this would enable in operation of more trains. He also wanted allocation of more funds for the ongoing Villupuram-Dindigul doubling project being executed by the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited.
Introduction of a new train to Bangalore from Tiruchi or from Tiruchi to Mysore was yet another demand placed by Mr.Kumar.
Rajya Sabha Member Tiruchi N.Siva sought the restoration of the Tiruchi-Bangalore train via Vriddhachalam and Salem which had been stopped. He also wanted the operation of a passenger train from Tiruchi to Villupuram.
Mr.Siva strongly argued for an escalator facility at Tiruchi railway junction, for which he had sanctioned funds, in the interest of the travelling public. He said a time-bound action plan was required to complete the Tiruvarur-Karaikudi gauge conversion works. Mayiladuthurai MP R.K.Bharathimohan wanted creation of additional infrastructure facilities at Kumbakonam railway station to cope with the huge flow of pilgrims during the Mahamaham festival scheduled in early 2016.
The facilities which include construction of a rail yatri nivas in Kumbakonam should be completed well before the festival, he said.
Restoration of train services between Mayiladuthurai and Tharangampadi and introduction of a direct train between Thanjavur and Salem via Kumbakonam, Cuddalore, and Vriddhachalam also formed part of his demands.
Chidambaram MP M.Chandrakasi sought additional infrastructure facilities at Chidambaram railway station. He said the rakes of the Uzhavan Express were kept idle in the morning hours in Thanjavur. It could be put to use by operating it as a train from Thanjavur to Cuddalore and back for the benefit of the travellers.
Pollachi MP C.Mahendran wanted the operation of a new train from Pollachi to Bangalore and another train from Pollachi to Chennai. Separate passenger reservation system at Udumalpet and provision of godown and passenger facilities at Pollachi were some of his other demands.

Trade facilitation on trackUpdated: November 18, 2014 01:52 IST
Trade facilitation on track
food security
The deal with the U.S. now provides for an indefinite peace clause until a permanent solution is found to the farm subsidy issue.
The deal between India and the U.S. on the contentious issue of public stockholdings of foodgrains for security should put the global trade negotiations back on track. The bilateral compromise provides the much-needed window to save the multilateral Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), a significant step in the history of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The TFA, cleared at a WTO ministerial meeting in Bali last year, is intended to simplify customs rules, speed up the release of goods from ports, and pare transaction costs. The Narendra Modi-led BJP government refused to sign the TFA, insisting on a permanent solution to the food subsidy issue before signing it. The bone of contention is over a WTO rule that caps subsidies to farmers at 10 per cent of the total historical value of farm production. This stipulation — as is articulated at the WTO — is seen to undermine the responsibility of developing countries to feed the poor. Not surprisingly, India and some others have questioned the methodology of arriving at such a subsidy cap. A ‘peace clause’ in the WTO rules does indeed provide a limited-year protection to India and the like from legal challenges by member-nations should they exceed the farm subsidy cap. What if the farm subsidy concerns remained unaddressed once the peace clause expires and member-nations are allowed to legally challenge violations of the subsidy cap? Complaints based on rules limiting farm subsidy could seriously hamper the government’s ability to ensure food stocking and supply for the poor. These fears were behind the blocking of the TFA by the Modi government. Had the impasse continued, the beneficial provisions on trade facilitation would have been delayed too.
The deal with the U.S. now provides for an indefinite peace clause until a permanent solution is found to the farm subsidy issue. The deal is a reflection of the Modi government’s assertion of national interest while being flexible on modalities. Once India’s stand and its concern over the implications for food security were explained clearly to the U.S., it came up with a reasonable response. If at one stage India risked global isolation, New Delhi did not insist on an immediate solution to the food subsidy issue but agreed to an indefinite peace clause. In all, it is a pact that enables the multilateral trade negotiations to move forward. With this deal in place, the TFA could become a reality. Of course, the bilateral pact will have to be ratified by the WTO but with the U.S. showing the way, other members would find it acceptable. It underscores once again the dominance of the U.S. in a multilateral global forum even while it is a recognition of India’s place in the global economic environment.

Paris Prosecutor Identifies Extremist Frenchman In ISIS VideoFrenchman Maxime Hauchard Identified As Extremist In ISIS Video

PARIS (AP) — The cold-eyed militants lined up behind their victims in the latest Islamic State video appear to come from outside the Middle East, including one from France and possibly two from Britain, as the extremist group tries to show a global reach.
The grisly video — clearly aimed at a Western audience — lingers as much on the faces of the camouflaged extremists as the men who are beheaded. The victims include American aid worker Peter Kassig and more than a dozen Syrian soldiers.
The images of the Islamic State militants, who are shown one by one in close-up, allowed authorities to identify one of them Monday as a 22-year-old Frenchman who converted to radical Islam.
Maxime Hauchard has been on the radar of French authorities since 2011 when he took two trips to Mauritania to attend a Quranic school, said Paris prosecutor Francois Molins. The prosecutor said investigators were trying to determine if another Frenchman also is in the video.
President Barack Obama confirmed Kassig's slaying after a U.S. review of the video.
The overwhelming majority of Islamic State fighters are from the Mideast, but the extremist group is trying to cement its claim on an Islamic empire straddling Iraq and Syria. Europe appears to be a fertile ground to find supporters, with officials saying thousands of young Europeans have headed off to jihad. More than 1,000 people in France alone are under surveillance for suspected plans to join the militants, officials said.
In the video released Sunday, some of the knife-wielding extremists standing behind their kneeling victims had distinctly Asian features. Another whose face was hooded had the familiar London accent of the jihadi who also appeared in beheading videos with American hostages James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and with British hostages David Haines and Alan Henning. There also were indications that a Welsh medical student may be the man standing next to Hauchard.
"It's quite transparent that IS is trying to exaggerate its base of support," said Charlie Winter, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation in London. "They are trying to show that Muslims from all over the world are protecting their Syrian brethren and their Iraqi brethren."
European officials are trying just as furiously to counter that message.
"I call solemnly and seriously on all our citizens, and notably our young people who are the primary target of the terrorist propaganda, to open your eyes to the terrible reality of the actions of Daesh," said French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. "These are criminals that are building a system of barbarity."
Hauchard gave an interview to France's BFM television in July, telling the network he had helped capture Mosul, the Iraqi city whose fall eventually prompted the United States to resume military operations in Iraq.
"We're waiting for death," Hauchard said at the time. "My objective is to be a martyr."
A man from Wales, Ahmed Muthana, said he thinks he saw his son, 20-year-old Nasser Muthana, in the latest video, and Winter, the British researcher, confirmed the likeness.
"It resembles him. I was shown a picture of the video. I cannot confirm it is him, but I think it might be," Ahmed Muthana told Britain's Press Association.
Kassig had gone to Syria on a humanitarian mission. His parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, said Monday that while their hearts have been shattered by his death, they believe his life is proof that "one person can make a difference."
"In 26 years, he has witnessed and experienced firsthand more of the harsh realities of life than most of us can imagine," Paula Kassig said in Indianapolis, Indiana, reading a brief statement. "But rather than letting the darkness overwhelm him, he has chosen to believe in the good — in himself and in others.
As for the French militant in the video, Molins said he had used aid work as a pretext.
"The humanitarian action was a facade. In fact, he wanted to fight and join Islamic State agents," Molins said.
With Kassig's death, the Islamic State group has killed five Westerners it was holding.
Unlike previous videos of slain Western hostages, the latest one did not show the decapitation of Kassig, the moments leading up to his death or threaten to kill any other Western hostages.
It identified the militants' location as Dabiq, a town in northern Syria that the Islamic State group uses as the title of its English-language propaganda magazine and where they believe an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and their enemies will occur.
The high-definition video also showed the beheadings of about a dozen men identified as Syrian military officers and pilots, all dressed in blue jumpsuits.
All of the militants wore brand new camouflage uniforms, except for the black-clad man who spoke with a British accent and warned that U.S. soldiers will meet a similar fate.
"We say to you, Obama: You claim to have withdrawn from Iraq four years ago," the militant said. "Here you are: You have not withdrawn. Rather, you hid some of your forces behind your proxies."
A U.S.-led coalition is targeting the Islamic State group in airstrikes in northern Syria, supporting Western-backed Syrian rebels, Kurdish fighters and the Iraqi military. The U.S. said 31 airstrikes had been carried out from Nov. 14-17 against Islamic State group targets.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the Islamic State group could grow worldwide if left unchecked. Already, he said, the IS has seized more land and resources "than al-Qaida ever had on its best day of its existence."
IS "leaders assume that the world will be too intimidated to oppose them," Kerry said. "But let us be clear: We are not intimidated."
Kassig served in the U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit, and was deployed to Iraq in 2007. After being medically discharged, he returned to the Middle East in 2012 and formed a relief group, Special Emergency Response and Assistance, to help Syrian refugees.
The Islamic State group still holds other captives, including British photojournalist John Cantlie, who has appeared in several videos delivering statements, likely under duress, and a 26-year-old American woman captured last year in Syria while working for aid groups. U.S. officials have asked that the woman not be identified for er safety.
The group's militants have beheaded or shot dead hundreds of captives, mostly Syrian and Iraqi soldiers, celebrating the mass killings in graphic videos.
The Islamic State group has declared a self-styled Islamic caliphate in areas under its control, which it governs according to its violent interpretation of Shariah law.

Here s What Big Oil Has In The Pipes If Keystone FailsHere's What Big Oil Has In The Pipes If Keystone Fails
Posted:
reddit
WASHINGTON –- TransCanada Corp., the company seeking to build the Keystone XL pipeline, has teamed up with the world's largest public relations firm to promote a proposed alternative pipeline that's entirely in Canada.
Greenpeace Canada obtained documents that the U.S. public relations firm Edelman drafted for TransCanada that outline a campaign to promote Energy East , the company's proposed 2,858-mile pipeline that would transport crude oil from the Alberta tar sands to the east coast of Canada . The company filed an application to build the Energy East pipeline last month -- a project that has been described as an "oil route around Obama" amid political wrangling over Keystone XL in the United States.
Greenpeace says the documents show a company increasingly concerned about the fate of Keystone XL, which would connect the tar sands with Gulf Coast refineries. TransCanada's Energy East also faces increasing opposition , as does a proposed pipeline to the west, Enbridge's Northern Gateway. Enbridge got approval from the Canadian government to build Nothern Gateway, but work has been delayed , in large part because of opposition from First Nation communities along the pipeline route.
"TransCanada has been saying, 'If you don't let us build Keystone, we will build to the east,'" said Keith Stewart, the climate and energy campaign coordinator for Greenpeace Canada. "These documents show that they're clearly worried about the Energy East pipeline as well. It's going to face just as rough a ride as Keystone or Northern Gateway."
The Energy East documents outline plans to create a "grassroots" advocacy campaign on behalf of TransCanada, recruit outside voices backing the company, and investigate environmental groups seen as threats to the project.
Stewart said the documents show Edelman and TransCanada "systematically organizing what we'd call a dirty tricks campaign" typical in the U.S., but not in Canada. "We're nice, we don't do things like that," Stewart said.
A campaign organization document , dated Aug. 5, details what it calls a "Promote, Respond, Pressure approach" to "respond to allegations and protect the company." The plan includes typical public relations work, such as promoting the "positive message" on the project and responding to "unfavorable coverage, charges, or negative attacks."  It also includes a plan to "work with third parties" to pressure opponents (emphasis theirs):
Add layers of difficulty for our opponents, distracting them from their mission and causing them to redirect their resources. We cannot allow our opponents to have a free pass. They will use any piece of information they can find to attack TransCanada and this project—attacks are part of a larger, modern oppositional effort to silence those on the other side … This point should particularly be made in communication to supportive third parties, who can in turn put the pressure on, especially when TransCanada can't.
The campaign organization document proposes a "research profile" of Canadian environmental groups, like the Council of Canadians, Equiterre, Ecology Ottawa, and David Suzuki Foundation, as well as the international group Avaaz. Another document on digital advocacy describes campaigns targeting labor groups, farmers, landowners, and people interested in national security in order to recruit "grassroots" supporters.
Many of the documents appear to be part of a pitch to get TransCanada to hire Edelman for the project, while others are action plans. TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline awaits a final decision in the U.S. after years of delays and strong pushback from environmental opponents.
Edelman spokesman Michael Bush declined to respond to questions about the firm's work for TransCanada. "We do not talk about the work we do for clients," he said via email.
Shawn Howard, a spokesman for TransCanada, confirmed that the documents Greenpeace obtained were recommendations Edelman had prepared for TransCanada on Energy East. He said Edelman has not done work for TransCanada on Keystone XL.
"While the versions you have are not the latest, we have moved forward with implementing certain components of the strategy," said Howard. He pointed to the site EnergyEastPipeline.com and a pro-Energy East petition as part of that campaign (both of which are clearly labeled as TransCanada-sponsored).
"We have been working with Edelman for several months now and appreciate the support they have provided in helping us better engage in the public conversation, both in Quebec and the rest of Canada," said Howard. "Edelman was chosen because of their presence in Quebec and their ability to understand the culture. This is an important component for TransCanada’s communications outreach as we move forward with this project."
Howard said the company has not implemented all of the recommendations in the documents, but is "focused on the pieces that support a coordinated and organized communications program to ensure communities, landowners, First Nations and all Canadians have the facts to make an informed decision about Energy East."
This type of campaign work is not new for Edelman. A "Grassroots Advocacy Vision Document" dated May 15, 2014, describes Edelman's previous work on "mobilization" for energy interests. It includes the "Energy Citizens" campaign that Edelman ran on behalf of the American Petroleum Institute -- a campaign designed to look like it came from ordinary citizens, but was in fact run by  oil lobbyists .
"Companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and Haliburton (and many more) have all made key investments in building permanent advocacy assets and programs to support their lobbying, outreach, and policy efforts," Edelman wrote. "In launching a program like this, TransCanada will be in good company with a strong roadmap to follow."
In a document focusing on its plan for the province of Quebec , Edelman outlines identifying and recruiting "third-party voices" that can help "build an echo chamber of aligned voices." That document notes that Edelman's general manager for digital public affairs, Mike Krempasky, would serve as the senior counsel for the TransCanada work. Krempasky, co-founder of the conservative blog Red State, was also involved in a previous Edelman campaign that enlisted bloggers to promote WalMart without disclosing that the company was paying them.
Edelman faced pushback earlier this year after The Guardian and Motherboard published stories pointing out that the company had done work for interests that deny climate change. In a blog post responding to those stories , CEO Richard Edelman wrote, "We do not work with astroturf groups and we have never created a website for a client with the intent to deny climate change."
While the TransCanada documents predate Edelman's August blog post, they include descriptions of work that some may consider "astroturf" work. "If astroturf is using artificial grassroots to support a corporate agenda, this is clearly it," said Kert Davies, executive director of the Climate Investigations Center, which has been investigating the role of public relations firms in energy and climate campaigns.
Davies said the documents aren't that surprising,  but it's not often you see the "full battle plan" for an industry PR effort. "This is a small window into the type of campaigns that oil companies and the American Petroleum Institute have been running for many years to try to affect the political arena."
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Edelman's CEO is Robert Edelman. His name is Richard Edelman.

Nursery admissions likely from mid-Dec  DPI(S) callsmeetingPrint
Written by Ifrah Mufti | Chandigrah | Posted: November 19, 2014 10:43 am
Nursery admissions in city schools for the 2015-16 session are likely to begin in mid-December. DPI(S) Kamlesh Kumar has called a meeting of officials and principals in the first week of December to decide on a common admission schedule.
Last year, the process had begun in November. This year, it has got delayed because the DPI(S) is away until month-end.
The schedule will be applicable to 65 government schools which have nursery classes and 80 private schools.
Last year, when the system was introduced, all schools followed the common schedule. This year, however, Vivek High School in Sector 38 opened its registration desks for nursery classes on Tuesday, without waiting for the common schedule.
H S Mamik, school chairman, said, “The Education Department started this experiment last year, but if they wanted to continue with this pattern, they should have issued the guidelines by October.”
He added, “It has been 20 years that we begin our admissions on this date and we cannot delay it because the administration has to first hold a meeting and then decide and release a schedule.”
Other private schools, however, are waiting for the announcement of a common schedule. Once this is finalised, they will update their websites with details like the number of seats available in various categories, age criteria, fee structure and the point system they will follow.
The four missionary schools will, like last year, have a separate schedule. These are St John’s School in Sector 26, Carmel Convent School in Sector 9, St Anne’s Convent School in Sector 32 and Sacred Heart School in Sector 26.
Different schools have different criteria for admission, like first come, first served basis, a point system, and draw of lots. They also have quotas, like those for siblings of students already studying in the school, children of alumnus, staff and the children residing in the neighbourhood.

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty scale new highs on FIIbuyingAfter hitting new peak in the opening trade, Sensex succumbed to profit-booking and selling by foreign funds at record levels.
By: PTI | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 10:43 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 5:08 pm
The benchmark BSE Sensex today logged new lifetime high of 28,294.01 but retreated after a late fall gripped stocks to end 130 points down at 28,032.85, amid profit-taking in bluechips from metal, power and oil&gas space.
The BSE 30-share barometer, after hitting the new peak in the opening trade, succumbed to profit-booking and selling by foreign funds at record levels. At one point, it slipped below the 28,000-mark to touch the day’s low of 27,963.51.
The gauge settled 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, lower at 28,032.85. Yesterday, it had touched intra-day high of 28,282.85 but had ended with a loss of 14.59 points.
Major losers that pulled down Sensex and Nifty from record highs included Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite, GAIL, BHEL, Tata Motors, NTPC, Sun Pharma, ONGC, CIL, RIL and SBI.
Similarly, the NSE 50-scrip index Nifty after scaling a new peak of 8,455.65 at the outset, beating previous record of 8,454.50 touched yesterday, fell. It ended below the 8,400-mark to close with a loss of 43.60 points, or 0.52 per cent, at 8,382.30. Intra-day, it had touched a low of 8360.50.
Traders said besides profit-booking, a mixed trend in global markets ahead of the release of minutes of Federal Reserve policy meeting, led to the fall in Indian shares.
“Market remained in a very narrow range for most part of the trading session and corrected in the last 90 minutes of the trading session. Stocks that were top performing in the first half of the trading session, were the ones that corrected the most in the second half of the trading session,” said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.
The local currency also appeared to be having a bad day with rupee trading near 62-levels against the US dollar.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors sold shares worth Rs 101.98 crore yesterday, first net sales in almost 3 weeks.
Sectorally, the BSE Metal index suffered the most by losing 2.14 per cent, followed by Power index which fell 1.80 per cent, Oil & Gas index by 1.35 per cent, Consumer Durables by 1.22 per cent and Realty index by 0.99 per cent.
Selling activity also gained momentum in small and mid-cap sector stocks. The BSE Small-cap index lost 0.65 per cent and Mid-cap index fell 0.63 per cent.
Bucking the trend, Dr Reddy, HUL, HDFC, Bajaj Auto, Airtel, L&T, Infosys and ICICI Bank ended up.

Citys main garbage dump close by  people at Dadumajra live withstenchThe garbage dump at Dadumajra. (Express photo by Sahil Walia)
Written by Gagandeep Singh Dhillon | Chandigrah | Posted: November 19, 2014 10:39 am
For residents of Dadumajra, the idea that they live in ‘City Beautiful’ is a joke. For, close to them is the city’s main  garbage dump, which creates a pervasive stench and is also responsible for several health problems and poor sanitation conditions.
The garbage site is fast piling up, but the Chandigarh Administration has not woken up to the problem.
“Be it summer or winter, night or day, this place always swarms with mosquitoes and flies. And then there is the constant stench, which is particularly bad when the wind blows or during the rain,” says Satish Goyal, a resident.
Ravi, a taekwondo player, says that when he goes for jogging in the morning, he often feels “nauseated” not only due to the stench but also due to the gases coming  from the garbage processing plant.
Vidya, another resident, says, “We’ve been living here since 1980. My husband got asthma only due to this dumping site, so did many other people. We cannot even go out for a stroll in the morning or evening. There have been several protests against this menace, but to no avail.”
The dump is spread over about 45 acres, of which an area of 20 acres is currently being used for disposal of both treated and untreated waste.
Narinder Chaudhary, president of Dalit Raksha Dal, says the administration is not bothered because “government officers or the affluent do not live here, it is mostly Dalits’’.
“Years ago, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had ordered the construction of a boundary wall to prevent spillage of garbage outside. But now the garbage has piled up three-storey high,” adds Choudhary, who recently wrote to the Prime Minister and the UT Administrator regarding the situation.
Asserting that most households in Dadumajra have at least one member suffering from a respiratory or other disease, Choudhary says that the UT Health Department should carry out a survey to ascertain the ill-effects of the dumping site.
“People from other parts of the city are not willing to marry off their daughters in this village because of this problem,” he says.
But there seems to be no end in sight for their ordeal.
Joint Municipal Commissioner Rajiv Gupta says, “There will be mosquitoes and flies wherever there is a garbage disposal site. We’ve not received any specific complaints, but we’re aware that nobody wants a garbage site in their neighbourhood. We’re constantly spraying the site with micro-nutrients and also landscaping the area. The process is monitored. We also constructed a massive wall after the residents demanded it.”

The clashes and the court-ordered barricade clearance hours earlier underscore the protest movement’s turn to a riskier phase as student leaders run out of options.
Four pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong were arrested Wednesday after they clashed with the police.
The arrests came after authorities cleared some barricades a day earlier from a small section of a site occupied by pro-democracy activists for more than 50 days.
Police used pepper spray, batons and riot shields against the umbrella-wielding protesters wearing masks, goggles and hardhats, who they said repeatedly charged their cordon and injured three officers.
The protesters used metal barricades and concrete slabs to smash glass doors at the legislature before officers police rushed in to push them back.
Pro-democracy lawmaker Fernando Cheung tried to intervene but was pulled aside by some protesters so that others could continue ramming the glass.
Mr. Cheung told reporters that he saw one person enter the building.
The violence apparently involved protesters who organised their action through an Internet forum with a reputation for attracting people with radical views.
Mr. Cheung and other lawmakers from the so-called “pan-democrat” camp condemned the violence, saying it undermined the non-violent civil disobedience movement.
The clashes and the court-ordered barricade clearance hours earlier underscore the protest movement’s turn to a riskier phase as student leaders run out of options.
The student-led democracy protesters reject restrictions laid down by Beijing on inaugural 2017 elections for the southern Chinese financial hub’s top leader. But the students have been fighting to maintain momentum as the protest drags on, with the Hong Kong government appearing to adopt a strategy of standing by in hopes it fizzles out.
The students’ requests to talk to China’s communist leaders in Beijing have been rebuffed and three student leaders were prevented from flying to Beijing on the weekend to try to contact the officials directly.

Shell wins Rs 18 000-cr case against I-T deptShell wins Rs 18,000-crore case against I-T dept

On the heels of it losing a similar case against telecom major Vodafone , the I-T department lost its Rs 18,000-crore transfer pricing cases against oil firm Shell India at the Bombay High Court, which on Tuesday quashed the department's tax order.
The tax sleuth had added Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 3,000 crore, respectively to the taxable income of Shell India Markets Pvt Ltd, the Indian subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, for the FY 2007-08 and FY 2008-09 in two transfer pricing cases.
The judgement comes in the wake of two similar transfer pricing cases, which were ruled in favour of the Indian subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc, in which the I-T department had sought adjustments of over Rs 4,500 crore last month.
The order in favour of Shell India was passed on Tuesday by a bench of justices M S Sanklecha and S C Gupte on a petition filed by Shell India Markets.
Transfer pricing tax orders of Income Tax against Shell and Vodafone pertain to alleged undervaluation of shares issued by their domestic subsidiaries to the parent companies abroad. Transfer pricing refers to the practice of arm's length pricing for transactions between group companies based in different countries to ensure that a fair price one that would have been charged to an unrelated party is levied.
Shell India had issued 870 million shares to Shell Gas BV in March 2009 at Rs 10 per share. However, the Income Tax department contended that the shares were grossly undervalued and it valued them at Rs 180 per share.
The department then added the difference to the taxable income of Shell India. In a separate development this year, the Income Tax department had issued a show-cause notice adding another Rs 3,100 crore to Shell India's income for FY 2009 in another transfer pricing case. Being aggrieved, the company moved the Bombay High Court challenging the tax notice.
Funding a subsidiary by issuing shares is a common practice among multi-national companies which view this as a capital transaction and out of the transfer pricing bracket. However, the tax department argues that such a deal is a transfer pricing arrangement by which the shares issued are undervalued and hence the company is liable to pay tax on the income generated out of it.
The high court did not agree with the department and quashed its order and show-cause notice against Shell India.

Amkette Trubeats Tango headphone review: This one can taketwoThe Amkette Trubeats Tango is priced Rs 1,499
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Posted: November 19, 2014 11:09 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 11:10 am
 
I have always considered Amkette as a company that strives to create products that don’t look like they are made in India. Their products might not be made in India but they also don’t look like what many Indian brands have been producing of late. The latest from this accessories company is a headphone that tries to satisfy Gen Y which wants to share everything. Yes, the Trubeats Tango lets you share your music through the headset.
Design: The Tango is very compact with small square earcups that can be pulled down from the headband. The headband and the earcups have soft leather making it very comfortable to wear. However, like with most closed headphones, the earcups tend to become a hot place for the ears are a few songs. While the Left earcup has the in-line, the right one has a 3.5mm port for you to connect another earphone. The Tango comes with  long tangle-free cable with a gold plated connector at the end for better sound quality. But if you ask me, the best thing about the design is the fact that the headphone can fold into a size that fits in your palm. Good for people who are on the move.
Performance: Catering to the Indian audience, the Tango comes with Bass-rich Trusound, which thankfully is not overpowering. The 40mm drivers seems to do a good job with most types of music, not just Bollywood fare. It could hold itself even at high volumes. There is no spillover from the earcups, even when you have taken them off your ears. From the latest PK songs to the ethereal voice of YouTube sensation Amira Willighagen, the Tango seemed to have everything under control. So far so good.
But the tango part of the Tango is the real disappointment. There is a small, but significant, loss in audio quality when you plug in another headphone to the unit. You will not realise the drop if you haven’t heard the primary set first. But, yes, if you try the primary one first and the add-on next it will be like going down a couple of steps.
Verdict: At Rs 1,499, the Amkette Trubeats Tango offers a decent option for those who want something better than a pair of earphones. It is even better for those who like to share their music with someone close as they travel, or just hang around. But don’t but the Tango just for that feature, think of that as an add-on that you could use once in a while.

Every hour  more than 40 people drown: WHOreportPrint
By: Express News Service | Pune | Posted: November 19, 2014 11:08 am
The World Health Organisation’s first global report on ‘Drowning: preventing a leading killer’ reveals that drowning claims the lives of 372,000 people each year and is among the ten leading causes of death for children and young people in every region.
In India, the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) reports show that there have been 30,041 deaths due to drowning in 2013 accounting for 7.5% of accidental deaths in the country at a rate of 2.4 deaths per 1000 population. There has been a 9% increase in the number of drowning cases in 2013 over the 2012 figure of 27,558. Among states, Lakshwadeep, Goa and Andaman and Nicobar Islands have the highest percentage share of deaths due to drowning.
Drowning is among the ten leading causes of death for children and young people. Globally, over half the deaths are among those aged less than 25 years. The highest rate of drowning is among children below 5 years of age.
The report released on Tuesday calls for a substantial scaling-up of efforts and resources to prevent drowning and outlines several actions to be taken by both national policy-makers and local communities. “Efforts to reduce child mortality have brought remarkable gains in recent decades, but they have also revealed otherwise hidden childhood killers,” says WHO Director General Dr Margaret Chan in a release.
Strategies for local communities include: installing barriers to control access to water; providing safe places such as day care centres for children; teaching children basic swimming skills and training bystanders in safe rescue and resuscitation.
At national level, interventions include: adoption of improved boating, shipping and ferry regulations, better flood risk management and comprehensive water safety policies.
“Almost all water presents a drowning risk, particularly inside and around our homes” says WHO Director for the Department for Management of Non-communicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention Dr Etienne Krug.
She added, “Drowning occurs in bathtubs, buckets, ponds, rivers, ditches and pools, as people go about their daily lives. Losing hundreds of thousands of lives this way is unacceptable, given what we know about prevention.”
The report also draws attention to the need of making drowning prevention an integral part of current debates, such as climate change which leads to floods, mass migrations including that of asylum seekers traveling by boat and issues such as rural development, water and sanitation.
Findings from the report:
*Globally, over half of all drowning deaths are among those aged under 25 years.
*The highest rates of drowning are among children under five years of age.
* Males are two times more likely to drown than females.
* More than 90% of drowning occurs in low- and middle-income countries, with the highest rates in the African, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions

Top executive of Aurobindo Pharma escapes attack during morning walk at upscale KBR Park inHyderabadPrint
By: Express News Service | Hyderabad | Posted: November 19, 2014 11:00 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 4:55 pm
Aurobindo Pharma vice-president Nityanand Reddy had a narrow escape when an assailant opened fire with an AK-47 rifle today morning at KBR park, a favourite place for morning walkers. Reddy came out of the park around 7:30 am and got into an Audi. He was putting on his seat belt when a man approached and forcibly got into rear seat, showed the gun and asked him to drive.
Police said the AK-47 belonged to the anti-Naxal Greyhounds force and was reported stolen last year from a camp in Gandipet near Hyderabad. When the assailant pulled out the gun from a bag, Reddy’s associate Prasad Reddy who was sitting in the front passenger seat turned around and tried to grab the gun. In the scuffle the gun went off, bullets hit the windshield and one grazed Nityanand Reddy.
Police Commissioner Mahender Reddy said eight rounds went off. “We think during the scuffle between the assailant and one occupant in the car, the gun went off accidentally. No one was seriously injured. Realising that things were out of his control the assailant dropped the car and got out. Prasad Reddy also got out and tried to grab him but he hit his hands and fled across the road and disappeared. The gun was reported stolen from a Greyhounds Police camp last year,” Mahender Reddy said.
KBR park, opposite the TDP Bhavan is a favourite place for high profile morning walkers. film stars, politicians including former CM Kiran Kumar Reddy go there daily.

A still from Tulu movie Madime which will hit cinemas on November 20, 2014.
Produced by Balakrishna Films and directed by Tulu playwright and director Vijaya Kumar Kodialbail, it would be the 53rd Tulu movie to be made.
A Tulu cinema ‘Madime’ will hit the cinemas here on November 20.
Produced by Balakrishna Films and directed by Tulu playwright and director Vijaya Kumar Kodialbail, it would be the 53rd Tulu movie to be made.
Addressing presspersons here on Tuesday Mr. Kodialbail, who has also written the screenplay and dialogue, said Bollywood singer Sonu Nigam and multi-lingual singer K.S. Chitra have sung a song each in it.
The story of the movie was based on the Tulu play ‘Madime’ by Mr. Kodialbail, which has been staged around 500 times. Mr. Kodialbail, who had earlier made popular Tulu play ‘Oriyardori Asal’ into a film, said Likith Shetty and Ramya Barna who were lead actors in ‘Oriyardori Asal’ were playing the lead roles in this film too. Some of the other actors are Usha Bhandary, comedian Bhojaraja Vamanjoor, Prashanth Siddi, Bantwal Jayarama Acharya and Santhosh Shetty.
Stating that it would be a three-hour film, Mr. Kodialbail said two more Tulu movies of his would be released after some time. In addition, talks were on to make five more Tulu films. All the upcoming films would be made before 2015.
He said a series of Tulu movies produced recently had added viewers to Tulu movies. Other Tulu films in the offing included Dibbana and Super Marmaye.

Rajan calls for focus on sustainable growthRBI chief Raghuram Rajan calls for focus on sustainable growth
Jean Paul Arouff     Port Louis    Last Updated: November 18, 2014  | 21:27 IST
RBI governor Raghuram  Rajan.
India will focus on sustainable economic growth and developed economies should do the same, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday.
The RBI is under corporate and government pressure to bring down interest rates and boost economic growth.
"We have to make sure that across the world we focus on sensible, sustainable sources of growth," Rajan told reporters in Mauritius on Tuesday.
"Developing countries understand that very well ... It is something that Mauritius is trying to do, it is also something that India is trying to do. It is something that even the developed world has to realise it has to do."
India's economy has grown at less than 5 per cent for the last two years. It picked up some momentum to grow 5.7 percent in the June quarter, but this is still way below the near double-digit growth last seen in 2008.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley suggested on Monday the bank could consider a rate cut, noting slower inflation.
However, Rajan has been focussed on achieving 6 percent inflation by January 2016 and most analysts do not expect a cut when he makes his next policy annoucement on December 2. Rajan has often emphasised that sustained economic growth requires inflation to fall and stay low.
India's consumer price inflation slowed to 5.52 percent in October on lower food and fuel prices, but is expected to inch up after December as comparisons become less striking.
"Lots of work to do to get India back on a strong growth path. The government has been putting together a series of reforms which I think cumulatively amount to big reforms. The central bank is putting together reforms. My sense is we will do what it takes," Rajan said.

Congress: Tired old rulers uncomfortably numbLovely has promised a number of “new faces” and an “aggressive campaign”.
Written by Aniruddha Ghosal | New Delhi | Posted: November 18, 2014 10:09 am
The downhill journey for the Congress began in December last year. The party was reduced to only eight seats in the Delhi Assembly. A year later, as it prepares for another Assembly election, the party clearly faces a daunting task. It is no longer in power at the Centre and is losing ground in other states. Senior leaders say the challenge is no longer to win the elections and form a government in Delhi but to hold on to and, perhaps, improve its tally.
After the 2013 rout, Sheila Dikshit, Delhi’s Chief Minister for 15 years, blamed then state unit chief Jai Prakash Aggarwal. The two were not known to share a good equation and had differed on a number of critical issues, including distribution of tickets, before the elections.
Aggarwal resigned, replaced by Arvinder Singh Lovely, Gandhi Nagar MLA. “Lovely was asked to ensure the DPCC was lively, took up ground issues and became a people’s party again,” a close associate of Lovely said.
With elections round the bend, the party is now faced with new differences, particularly between Lovely and senior leaders. “Lovely has isolated the senior leadership. His protests involve only leaders he is close to,” a senior leader said.
Senior leaders have repeatedly demanded Dikshit’s return to Delhi politics. Minority MLAs Mateen Ahmed (Seelampur) and Asif Mohd Khan (Okhla) met Sonia Gandhi in July and Rahul Gandhi last week, seeking a revamp of the DPCC. There was speculation that Ahmed and Asif could break away from the party to support a BJP government in order to avoid fresh elections. Lovely denies any differences.
The Congress this time has decided to break from tradition and announce its candidates’ list soon. Lovely has promised a number of “new faces” and an “aggressive campaign”. Sources said the party high command wants a change in strategy, changing about a third of its existing candidates and bringing in new leaders. “One of the new candidates likely to contest in Delhi is Sharmistha Mukherjee, daughter of President Pranab Mukherjee. She might get a ticket from Greater Kailash,” a senior leader said.
Sources said while senior leader Ajay Maken would support the campaign, the party might bring back Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler. Sources said former MP Krishna Tirath and former MLA Kiran Walia are among those jockeying for tickets. While Dikshit has been silent on whether she would contest, AICC general secretary in charge of Delhi, Shakeel Ahmed said the decision would be hers, but “she’ll definitely be our star campaigner”.

Down  but not out  Baba Siddique is still at your serviceThe ‘thank-you’ pamphlet.
Written by Anjali Lukose | Mumbai | Posted: November 18, 2014 10:39 am
Losing the state Assembly polls has not stopped some of the candidates from splashing their “efforts” and “thanks” on hoardings across their constituency. Voters from Andheri East and Bandra West constituencies have been bombarded with “thanks” from losing candidates – BJP’s Sunil Yadav and Congress’s Baba Siddique, respectively.
On Monday, Bandra residents woke up to pamphlets with Siddique’s photo and a loud message. “THANK YOU BANDRAKRUZ, BABA SIDDIQUE AT YOUR SERVICE,” screamed the pamphlets distributed with morning newspapers.
The pamphlet went on to say, “I thank each and every voter of Bandra, Khar and Santacruz for their support. Each of the 47,868 votes polled in my favour are important and showed the immense faith and support in the constituency, which was represented by me as your MLA, for which I have great affection and respect”.
“Why should I not thank my voters? I have thanked them the last five times [referring to his three terms as MLA and two as a corporator]. Around two lakh ‘thank you’ pamphlets have been sent along with English, Urdu and Marathi papers,” Siddique said.
Going by the pamphlets, Siddique “accepted the mandate with great humility” while promising to “continue to strive and work towards the issues concerning the constituency”. Siddique’s wasn’t a novel idea.
Yadav, who contested the Assembly polls for the first time and finished second in Andheri East, also distributed similar pamphlets and put up flex hoardings thanking his voters across the constituency. The only difference was that Yadav’s hoarding and pamphlets gave a larger display to PM Narendra Modi and BJP’s symbol lotus than his own face while Siddique’s pamphlet had no mention of his Congress party.
“Nivadnook Haarlo, Himmat Nahi (lost the election, not my courage),” went Yadav’s hoarding, adding, “Just 11 days of campaigning and contesting on a lotus symbol for the first time won me 47,338 votes from Andheri East, so I thanked my voters for their blessings.”
“I’m the only losing BJP candidate who thought of doing this, but I had to thank people who voted for me despite just 11 days of campaigning. Now that we have a BJP government in the state and with more visibility in the BMC, I’m working at solving issues in the constituency such as lack of proper water supply, drainage and waste collection and grievances I heard during my campaign,” Yadav said.
Meanwhile, Ashish Shelar, who trounced the three-time MLA Siddique by a margin of over 26,000 votes, refused to comment, just saying he was only committed to working for all.
Shiv Sena’s Ramesh Latke, who defeated Yadav from Andheri East, said “it is a nice thing to thank voters”.

Police exam must be in Urdu and English too: Muslim leadersPrint
Written by Tabassum Barnagarwala | Mumbai | Posted: November 18, 2014 11:10 am
In an attempt to raise the representation of Muslims in the police service, a congregation of leaders from various Muslim associations and councils approached the Minority Development department Monday with a request to implement the facility of bilingual question papers for the non-Maratha section.
“The questions must be made available also in English and Urdu, apart from Marathi. The questions are framed in chaste Marathi, which is extremely difficult for the non-Marathi medium students to understand,” the letter submitted to the Minority Ministry said.
The request to the new BJP-led government comes after Minority Affairs minister Eknath Khadse last week announced the introduction of an option to study Urdu in Marathi schools in addition to the facility of learning Marathi in Urdu-medium schools that are run by the state government.
“Several Muslims find it difficult to get inducted in the state police service for posts like constables and inspectors because they clear all stages but fail when it comes to writing and conversing in Marathi. If they are given question papers in English or Urdu, chances of cracking it are much higher,” said M A Khalid, a social activist.
In the meeting conducted with the joint secretary of the Minority Affairs department, Ainul Attar, members of associations like the All India Milli Council and All India OBC Movement were present. Attar admitted that according to the Official Languages Commission, an additional language can be incorporated in a state which has 8-10 per cent of its population speaking that particular language.
While a raise in Muslim representation in police service was the point of the agenda, the leaders also requested the Minority Affairs department to revive the 15-point programme, first initiated in 2006 by the central government, to its full force in the state. As per the programme, ‘100 Muslim youths from every district were to be trained for the written exam of police service’, said the letter.
While in their letter, the Muslim associations slammed the former Congress-NCP government for making lofty promises but failing to improve representation of the minority community in the state, they also challenged the new government to create awareness about five per cent Muslim reservation in educational institutes following the Bombay High Court’s directive to allow 5 per cent reservation of Muslims in educational institutes, citing the ‘abysmally low’ educational achievements of Muslims.

BJP: Many heads  just one face: ModisIt is the first time that the BJP will contest a Delhi Assembly election without a chief ministerial candidate.
Written by Pragya Kaushika | New Delhi | Posted: November 18, 2014 10:00 am
Riding on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity, the BJP seems confident of a victory in Delhi. The new formula — where no state leader is named as the future chief minister and the PM and top national leaders do widespread campaigning, keeping allied at arms length — was successfully applied in Haryana and Maharashtra last month and will be put to test again here. The cadre feels that the PM’s charisma will win the state polls as it did for the Lok Sabha in May when the BJP won all seven seats.
“We know the Modi wave will win us this election. The exercise of mobilising the cadre via jansabhas is to ensure that there be no risk to our victory,” a senior leader said.
It is the first time that the BJP will contest a Delhi Assembly election without a chief ministerial candidate. Unlike last December, when Harsh Vardhan was that face, the party does not want Delhi to slip through its hands because of a “weak” face in the fray. With Modi as the front man, the chances of party’s leaders fighting against one another, as was the case in past elections, is expected to diminish.
“There were always groups who would try to sabotage the election chances of a party candidate as they did not want their rivals to win. With Modi as the face, that will change,” a senior leader said.
One standout point in the party’s pre-poll strategy has been to bring councillors to prominence. While a councillor was appointed as the Delhi unit chief for the first time, two other were given the important posts of the general secretary. Upadhyay had his say in forming the new team and, except Ramesh Bidhuri, none of the MPs form Delhi could make it.
New posts were created to keep on board three MLAs who are said to be close to Upadhyay. Kulwant Rana, Manoj Shokeen and Subhash Sachdeva were made convenors of the three corporations, posts that did not exist in the Delhi unit.
Upadhyay also ensured that responsibility was given to councillors who are expected to play a major role in the forthcoming polls. This is also the first time in that Delhi BJP that a Brahmin has been appointed the party chief. In the past, leaders from the Punjabi and Baniya communities have held the position.
It emerged from the last Assembly polls that the BJP has only one political rival, the AAP. But the state unit has been told to ignore the AAP and focus on connecting directly with voters. “The more we talk about them (AAP), the more credence they get,” a continued…

The Socratic debate: Whose internet is it anywayNovember 18, 2014, 5:44 am IST Economic Times in ET Citings | World | ET

By Pranesh Prakash
In the US, President Obama recently spoke out on the seemingly arcane topic of net neutrality. What is more astounding is that the popular satire news show host John Oliver spent a 13-minute segment talking about it in June, telling Internet trolls to “focus your indiscriminate rage in a useful direction” by visiting the US Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) website and submitting comments on its weak draft proposal on net neutrality. Due to the work of activists, popular media coverage, pro-net neutrality technology companies, and John Oliver, eventually the FCC received 1.1 million responses. Text analysis by the Sunlight Foundation using natural language processing found that only 1% of the responses were clearly opposed to net neutrality. So millions of people in the US are both aware and care about this issue. But the general response in India would be: what is net neutrality and why should I be concerned?
Net neutrality is commonly described as the principle of ensuring that there is no discrimination between the different ‘packets’ that an Internet service provider (ISP) carries. That means that the traffic from NDTV should be treated equally by Reliance Infocomm as the traffic from Network 18’s CNNIBN; that even if Facebook wants to pay Airtel to deliver Whatsapp’s packets faster than Viber’s, Airtel may not do so; that peer-to-peer traffic is not throttled; that Facebook will not be able to pay Airtel to keep its subscribers bound within its walled gardens; and also that Airtel can’t claim to be providing Internet access while restricting that to only Facebook or Whatsapp.
The counter to this by telecom companies the world over, which has little evidence backing it, is primarily two-fold: first, one of equity — that it is ‘unfair’ for the likes of YouTube to get a ‘free ride’ on Airtel networks, hogging up bandwidth but not paying them; and second, that of economic incentives — networks are bleeding money due to services like WhatsApp and Skype replacing SMS and voice, and not being able to charge them will lead to a decrease in profitability and network expansion. The first claim is based on a myth of the ‘free ride’, while the reality is that subscribers who download more also pay the ISP more, while contentemitting companies also have to pay their network providers as per the traffic they generate, and those network providers, in turn, have to enter into ‘transit’ or ‘peering’ agreements with the ISPs that eventually provide access to consumers. The second claim has little evidence to back it up. Efficient competition is the best driver of both profit as well as network expansion. VSNL complained about services like Net2Phone in the 1990s and even filtered all voice-over-IP (VoIP) traffic — and illegally blocked a number of VoIP websites — to preserve its monopoly over international telephony. Instead, removing VSNL’s monopoly only benefited our nation. As for network expansion, it is inability of networks to profit from sparsely populated rural areas that poses a major roadblock. Fixing those problems require smart pricing by telecom companies and intelligent regulation, including exploring policy options like shared spectrum, but they do not necessarily require the abandoning of net neutrality.
However, the fact that the reasons telecom companies often provide against net neutrality are bogus doesn’t mean that it’s easy to ensure net neutrality. The Trai has been exploring this issue by holding a seminar on OTT services. However, the main focus of the discussions were not whether and how India should ensure net neutrality: it was on whether the government should regulate services like WhatsApp and bring them under the licence Raj. Yes, the debate going around in the regulatory circles is whether India should implement rules to ensure net non-neutrality so as favour telecom companies! Net neutrality is a difficult issue in regulatory terms since there is no common understanding among academics and activists of what all should fall under its ambit: only the ‘last mile’ or interconnection as well?
The policy dialogue in India is far removed from this and from considering the nuanced positions of anti-net neutrality scholars, such as Christopher Yoo, who raise concerns about the harms to innovation and the free market that would be caused by mandating net neutrality. The situation in India is much more dire, since blatant violations of net neutrality — howsoever defined — are already happening with Airtel launching its ‘One Touch Internet’, a limited walled garden approach that lies about offering access to the ‘Internet’ while only offering access to a few services based on secretive agreements with other companies. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, recently toured India talking about his grand vision of providing connectivity to the bottom half of the pyramid yet did not talk about how that connectivity would not be to the Internet, but will be limited to only a few services — including Facebook.
Even if we had good laws in favour of net neutrality, without effective monitoring and forceful action by the government, they will amount to little. s. Undoubtedly the contours of the conversation that needs to happen in India over net neutrality will be different from that happening in more developed countries with higher levels of Internet penetration.
However it is a cause of grave concern that while net neutrality is being brutally battered by telecom companies in the absence of any regulation, they are also seeking to legitimize their battery through regulation. It is time the direction of the conversation changed. Perhaps we should invite John Oliver over.

Ingredion predicts $8 billion in sales by 2019Ingredion predicts $8 billion in sales by 2019

Ingredion focusing on specialty products, international growth
Ingredion said Tuesday its annual sales should hit $8 billion by 2019, up from $6.33 billion last year, as the ingredients-maker pushes to notch more sales from fast-growing specialty products and international markets.
0
The announcement comes weeks after Ingredion, formerly known as Corn Products International, reduced its 2014 profit forecast, citing cost pressures in Argentina and the softer economy in Brazil. The bulk of Ingredion's business is selling products such as starches and sweeteners to food companies. It also sells its products to companies that make items such as drinks, pharmaceuticals, animal feed and paper products.
Shares of Ingredion fell 28 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $81.34 after hitting a new high of $81.86 earlier in the day.
Ingredion said it expects specialty products to make up 27 to 30 percent of its sales by 2019, up from about 23 percent in 2014. Specialty products include products such as texturizers for food and sweeteners such as stevia. As part of its focus on specialty products, Ingredion last month announced plans to buy Penford, a maker of specialty starches, for about $340 million.
Specialty ingredients are growing at a faster pace than traditional products and carry higher margins than Ingredion's core portfolio, CFO Jack Fortnum said in a statement.
Officials of Ingredion, which is based in Westchester, met with analysts Tuesday at the company's innovation center in Bridgewater, N.J. They outlined plans to focus on four growth platforms for ingredients that are wholesome, provide texture, are focused on nutrition and on sweetness.
Ingredion said it expects 2 to 4 percent sales growth each year, with stronger growth coming from outside North America. Ingredion expects annual growth in North America of 1 to 3 percent, while growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region is likely to be as high as 6 to 8 percent. North America makes up about 54 percent of its sales now and should account for 50 percent of sales in five years, the company said.
Ingredion also said it expects some of the strongest growth in its food business, which accounts for 49 percent of sales and should rise to 52 percent of sales in five years. The company anticipates 3 to 5 percent annual sales growth in its food business, while sales of beverage products are expected to be flat to up 1 percent each year.

Capitals-Coyotes: Game 18 discussion threadBy Alex Prewitt November 18 Follow @alex_prewitt
The Capitals will take on the Coyotes on Tuesday night. (Associated Press)
GLENDALE, Ariz. — With their next three games against teams with a combined 18-30-8 record, the Washington Capitals arrived in this sunny Phoenix suburb with a perfect chance to reroute November. They have lost two straight, scoring just one goal total against New Jersey and St. Louis, but had a full day off in Arizona and a practice day too, while the Coyotes traveled back from western Canada, winners of two straight.
Unlike in their earlier games, when blown leads became commonplace, the Capitals fought uphill battles last weekend, issues created partially by several goaltending miscues. But with the possibility of a high-scoring game ahead — Arizona won the last meeting in D.C., 6-5 — Coach Barry Trotz hoped for a stronger response if his team jumped to an early lead. As Monumental Network’s Mike Vogel noted , the Capitals have been outscored by 11 goals in the third period over their past 10 games.
“I think it’s a little bit of a mindset,” he said. “A lot of the games we’ve either been tied or up, and we’ve tended to lately get on our heels and try to manage the game rather than getting on our toes, keep pushing forward and pushing north. I think that’s a little been more problematic than most things.”
The Capitals are 0-2-1 in their past three games in Arizona, last winning on Jan. 16, 2006, when forward Alex Ovechkin was a rookie. The puck drops around 7 p.m. local time  – 9 p.m. on the East Coast. Washington will fly to Colorado after the game, practice Wednesday afternoon at the University of Denver then close its road trip against the Avalanche on Thursday night. The lines, goaltending matchup, injuries and links are below, as always. Thanks for stopping by.

From UP to Kashmir  a BJP team with RSS expertisePrint
Written by Lalmani Verma | Lucknow | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:00 am
The BJP has sent at least 24 UP leaders with an RSS background to Jammu and Kashmir to assess public opinion about the party, to appeal to people to vote for the BJP when the central government is headed by Narendra Modi, and to guide local party workers in election management.
These leaders have so far been given responsibility of 40 assembly constituencies, and will stay there until campaigning ends for the last of the five phases. Among these constituencies are Ramban, Kishtwar, Doda, Bhaderwah, Inderwal, Gulberg, Reasi, Chenani, Udhampur and Ramnagar.
A senior BJP leader said these leaders, with their experience of having worked in the RSS, are skilled in poll management and coordinating with workers. They include former MLAs Ramashish Rai and Udaibhan Singh, former MLC Satish Sharma, Bundelkhand regional general secretary Rajesh Singh Sengar, Braj regional vice-president Vipin Verma “David”, former Agra district president Pramod Gupta, youth wing national vice-president Shiv Bhushan Singh and party state spokesperson Chandra Mohan.
Shiv Bhushan Singh, Pramod Gupta and Ramashish Rai have gone into the BJP after working a long time with ABVP, the RSS student wing. Rajesh Singh Sengar had been an RSS pracharak and worked with Hindu Jagaran Manch in several districts, Vipin Verma and Chandra Mohan are from Swadeshi Jagran Manch, and Satish Sharma and Udaibhan Singh are RSS swayamsevaks.

Morena: School principal booked for molesting teacher  forcing her to convert to ChristianityPrint
Written by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal | Posted: November 19, 2014 11:32 am
A Hindu teacher in Morena has accused the principal of a Christian school of molesting her and also pressuring her to convert to Christianity.
The 31-year-old teacher filed a complaint with the Civil Lines Police Station, Morena, on Tuesday, alleging that Fr Dilip Nanda, in early 40s, keeps pressuring her to have illicit relations with him.
The complainant alleged that along with sister Brigette, the principal over the four-and-a-half years also tried to coerce her to change her faith. Her husband, also a teacher in the same school, accompanied her to the police station.
The couple alleged that the principal used to threaten them that they will be sacked if they spoke against him.
A few days ago, the principal had filed an application in the same police station apprehending that the couple could lodge a complaint against him by cooking up some charges.
Civil Lines Police Station in-charge Amit Singh Bhadoria told The Indian Express that the police could not have acted on the principal’s hypothetical application.
Bhadoria said the police have booked the principal under Section 354 of the IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the M P Freedom of Religion Act. Sister Brigette has also been booked under the anti-conversion law.
The police searched the father’s possible hideouts on Tuesday and early Wednesday but could not take him in custody.  Bhadoria said the police will also investigate all aspects of the case.

For Mission 6 to 60  LJP to focus on UPUnion Minister Ram Vilas Paswan with his son and MP Chirag Paswan at a Lok Janshakti Party workers’ meeting, in Lucknow on Tuesday. (Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)

LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan Tuesday attacked ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh for considering “Dalits as its rivals and doing nothing for Muslims”, as he addressed party workers here as part of his attempt to increase party’s Lok Sabha tally from “six to 60”.
The LJP chief attacked both the SP and BSP.
Seeking to woo the Dalit vote bank in UP, Paswan alleged that BSP chief Mayawati did nothing for the community. “Mayawati had once given the slogan of ‘tilak-taraju aur talwar inko maro….At the time of polls she changed it to ‘haathi nahi Ganesh hai, Brahma Vishnu Mahesh hai’. The result was that neither the Dalits nor Brahmins are with her anymore,” Paswan said while addressing a meeting of his party workers here.
Paswan, who is Union minister for Food and Civil Supplies, also attacked SP for “opposing reservation in promotions”, saying Mulayam Singh Yadav considered Dalits as his rivals.
“All the parties except the SP had supported reservation in promotions in the Lok Sabha. Mulayam had opposed the Dalits in order to please upper castes,” Paswan claimed.
Paswan who is aiming to increase his party tally in Lok Sabha from the present “six to 60” by the next polls, questioned the Akhilesh Yadav government about the reservation his government had promised to Muslims during the polls. “How much quota has been granted by him to Muslims in the two-and-a-half year of government,” Paswan asked.
“They had been demanding 18 per cent reservation for Muslims from the Centre how much have they given in Uttar Pradesh,” he asked.
Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Paswan said Modi has said that it is his duty to provide security to minorities, Dalits, Muslims, Upper castes and women. “It is the result of the PM’s efforts that even Hurriyat faction is also ready for talks,” he said.
Paswan said that through his ministry, wheat was being provided at Rs two per kg and rice at Rs three per kg rice to all the states, and asked,”why it is not available in UP.

Every hour  more than 40 people drown: WHO reportPrint
By: Express News Service | Pune | Posted: November 19, 2014 11:08 am
The World Health Organisation’s first global report on ‘Drowning: preventing a leading killer’ reveals that drowning claims the lives of 372,000 people each year and is among the ten leading causes of death for children and young people in every region.
In India, the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) reports show that there have been 30,041 deaths due to drowning in 2013 accounting for 7.5% of accidental deaths in the country at a rate of 2.4 deaths per 1000 population. There has been a 9% increase in the number of drowning cases in 2013 over the 2012 figure of 27,558. Among states, Lakshwadeep, Goa and Andaman and Nicobar Islands have the highest percentage share of deaths due to drowning.
Drowning is among the ten leading causes of death for children and young people. Globally, over half the deaths are among those aged less than 25 years. The highest rate of drowning is among children below 5 years of age.
The report released on Tuesday calls for a substantial scaling-up of efforts and resources to prevent drowning and outlines several actions to be taken by both national policy-makers and local communities. “Efforts to reduce child mortality have brought remarkable gains in recent decades, but they have also revealed otherwise hidden childhood killers,” says WHO Director General Dr Margaret Chan in a release.
Strategies for local communities include: installing barriers to control access to water; providing safe places such as day care centres for children; teaching children basic swimming skills and training bystanders in safe rescue and resuscitation.
At national level, interventions include: adoption of improved boating, shipping and ferry regulations, better flood risk management and comprehensive water safety policies.
“Almost all water presents a drowning risk, particularly inside and around our homes” says WHO Director for the Department for Management of Non-communicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention Dr Etienne Krug.
She added, “Drowning occurs in bathtubs, buckets, ponds, rivers, ditches and pools, as people go about their daily lives. Losing hundreds of thousands of lives this way is unacceptable, given what we know about prevention.”
The report also draws attention to the need of making drowning prevention an integral part of current debates, such as climate change which leads to floods, mass migrations including that of asylum seekers traveling by boat and issues such as rural development, water and sanitation.
Findings from the report:
*Globally, over half of all drowning deaths are among those aged under 25 years.
*The highest rates of drowning are among children under five years of age.
* Males are two times more likely to drown than females.
* More than 90% of drowning occurs in low- and middle-income countries, with the highest rates in the African, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions

Actor Aamir Khan, who is known to share a special friendship with Salman, was seen being very much a part of the wedding festivities. He even accompanied the bridal couple Amrita and Aayush along with Salman for the media interactions post the nuptials.
Katrina Kaif, on the other hand, maybe a former flame of the bride’s brother, but the actress is very close to the Khan family, especially Arpita. She was stunning in a white outfit, as she par took in the wedding celebrations.
However, boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor and his parents Neetu Singh, Rishi Kapoor were reportedly not invited for the big wedding. Ranbir’s sister Riddhima did receive an initiation, but was unable to attend it.
Actress Priyanka Chopra also made it a point to attend the Khan wedding in a gorgeous royal blue Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla sari with a rich gold border. Filmmakers Karan Johar, Kabir Khan and his wife Mini Mathur were also seen having a gala time as they shared pictures from the wedding.

Growth  not inflation  should be Modi s priorityGrowth, not inflation, should be Modi's priority
Business Today throws open a debate to B-school students

Business Today throws open a debate to B-school students. This fortnight's topic: Growth, not inflation, should be Narendra Modi's priority.
AGREE
"The economy faces stagflation, the government must focus on growth"
Supreet Lakhotia
MBA-1,
Symbiosis Institute of Business Management, Pune
With the budget due in July, the new government faces the key concern of choosing its main fiscal policy aim: should it promote growth or tame infl ation? Despite the RBI pushing up the repo rate to eight per cent, infl ation remains threatening. The reason is that the Indian economy faces the prospect of stagfl ation - a rare but sticky phenomenon.
Contractionary policies have not curbed infl ation. Slowdown across the industrial sector is worrisome as seen from the dismal IIP figures. Food articles constitute almost 50 per cent of the consumer price index (CPI), and an inelastic demand for agricultural output has pushed for double-digit CPI. With welfare policies like MGNREGA, not only has the purchasing power of the rural household moved upwards but minimum farm wage price has also increased. Meanwhile, the economy is stuck with supply bottlenecks such as disintegrated supply chain networks and, of course, lackadaisical government machinery.
The new government defi nitely needs to focus on growth with a two-pronged strategy. First, it should concentrate on infrastructure. This should aim at boosting productivity through resource optimisation (the riverlinking programme, single-window clearance, etc) rather than doling out more subsidies. Second, a quick approval of the Goods and Services Tax is needed to ease cash fl ows and help reduce the ballooning fi scal deficit.

Teach quality Sanskrit  make child a richer IndianNovember 18, 2014, 12:54 pm IST Bibek Debroy in Policy Puzzles | India | ET

I hardly studied Sanskrit in school. At that time, under the system I studied under, there was one year of compulsory Sanskrit in Standard VII. After that, if you opted for what was called the “Science” stream, which I chose, you and Sanskrit parted ways. I remember that one year of compulsory Sanskrit as agony.
Sanskrit is a language. You should begin to learn it like any other language, speak it and converse in it. But Sanskrit grammar is also extremely structured, almost mathematical. Why do some people hate mathematics?
For most such people, the answer is bad teaching in the formative years. Sanskrit is no different. Bad teaching means being forced to mug up tables of grammar.  Those tables have principles. If you understand those principles, there is no need to mug anything up.
Unfortunately, you don’t appreciate and understand those principles until you have advanced comprehension of how the language works. It’s a bit like mugging up the roots of a quadratic equation. If you understand the principles, there is no need to memorise anything. You can derive the roots.
But Sanskrit is plagued by bad teaching, bad textbooks and bad syllabi. That’s the reason it becomes agony. It isn’t a problem with the language.  If we can’t ensure the teaching, there is no point in making anything compulsory. Children pick up languages easily, more easily than adults do.  Many children are certainly trilingual, even more. Taught naturally, at those ages, Sanskrit is no burden at all.
I was drawn to Sanskrit much later in life, when I was more like 35. Contrary to what many people seem to think, Sanskrit isn’t the language of religion. The religious texts are certainly in Sanskrit. But there is a huge corpus of what can be called secular literature, in Sanskrit.
People are sometimes surprised when I say that many Sanskrit texts were authored by Buddhists, including the first ever dictionary/thesaurus, still used.  I was initially drawn to Sanskrit because of the literature and learning a language at 35 is much more difficult. I have always regretted not having studied Sanskrit properly in school and envied those of my classmates who chose the “Humanities” stream and studied Sanskrit.
Culture is difficult to pin down and define. But however you choose to define it, culture is intimately connected with language and virtually all Indian languages (Tamil went through a conscious cleansing) owe their origins to Sanskrit. I do wish to know about my country’s history. I do wish to understand what was shaped us, what are my roots.  In understanding these answers, Sanskrit enriches me. Had I not studied Sanskrit, the world of Sanskrit would have lost nothing. I would have been the loser.  I have met plenty of people who seem to envy me now.
What use would Sanskrit have been, had I compulsorily studied it in school, and not made use of it in later life? What have those of my classmates who studied it, done with it thereafter? I think that’s an irrelevant question.
In school, we don’t know what a kid will do later in life, what his/her skills, aptitude and profession will be. The objective of school education is to provide a template of knowledge and skills, given that uncertainty. What use has my knowledge of chemistry, physics or mechanics done for me? It’s made me more aware. But Sanskrit also does precisely that.  It makes all Indians more aware of history, culture and roots and I think that is valuable.
The German versus Sanskrit controversy is irrelevant, in my view. That’s not the choice. Provided we can ensure quality teaching, Sanskrit should be part of the compulsory template. By all means let us teach a “modern” foreign language in addition, and German can be of the choices. Plus English and the mother tongue/Hindi. 4 languages isn’t too much for a child to handle. It seems too much for adults who devise syllabi and textbooks. Not for a kid. Make the child a richer Indian in that sense.

Islamic State terrorists ideology must be undermined: UNThe UN human rights chief called for a campaign led by Muslims to undermine the ideology of the Islamic State terrorist group.
By: Associated Press | United Nations | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:15 am
The UN human rights chief called on Tuesday for a campaign led by Muslims to undermine the ideology of the Islamic State terrorist group, saying this may ultimately be more effective than airstrikes.
Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, a Jordanian prince and the first UN human rights chief from the Muslim and Arab world, told the UN Security Council that by calling for a caliphate, or Islamic state, the group is exploiting “a general yearning” shared by many Muslims the world over.
But he stressed that many Muslims are opposed to the terrorist group for the crimes it has committed in enforcing its ideology, which likely amount to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
The Islamic State group first took control of parts of Syria and then swept across the border in early June capturing a large swath of northern and western Iraq. A US-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes against the group in Iraq and Syria but Zeid questioned “whether it is possible to bomb an ideology like this into submission.”
Zeid implored the Security Council to support efforts to overturn the Islamic State group’s “ideology of violence and death, for the sake of the rights of all in Iraq.” He also urged the new Iraqi government to join the International Criminal Court so the Islamic State group’s leaders can be prosecuted.
The group rejects any individual thought “outside of their closed unyielding logic,” Zeid said, and all dissenters “must be murdered, their memory, culture, every shred of their existence destroyed.”
Zeid said it was disturbing that there have been “few to non-existent” public demonstrations in the Arab and Muslim worlds against the crimes in Iraq by the Islamic State group despite condemnations by many Arab and Islamic governments.
He urged much greater global attention to a letter two months ago by 126 prominent Muslim scholars that gives a point-by-point rebuttal to the Islamic State group’s claims, calling its argument “a promising approach.”
The rights chief quoted from the letter including its message to the Islamic State group’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi: “You have misinterpreted Islam into a religion of harshness, brutality, torture and murder. This is a great wrong and an offense to Islam, to Muslims and to the entire world.”
Nikolay Mladenov, the UN’s top envoy in Iraq, said local communities “are beginning to push back” against the Islamic State group whose goal is “to destroy the Iraqi state and replace it with a State of Terror.” He said the process of working with local fighters should go hand-in-hand with retraining and re-equipping the Iraqi army.
“We’re not looking at the collapse of the Iraqi state,” Mladenov said later. “We’ve turned the tide.”
UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told the council that humanitarian continued…

Top executive of Aurobindo Pharma escapes attack during morning walk at upscale KBR Park in HyderabadPrint
By: Express News Service | Hyderabad | Posted: November 19, 2014 11:00 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 4:55 pm
Aurobindo Pharma vice-president Nityanand Reddy had a narrow escape when an assailant opened fire with an AK-47 rifle today morning at KBR park, a favourite place for morning walkers. Reddy came out of the park around 7:30 am and got into an Audi. He was putting on his seat belt when a man approached and forcibly got into rear seat, showed the gun and asked him to drive.
Police said the AK-47 belonged to the anti-Naxal Greyhounds force and was reported stolen last year from a camp in Gandipet near Hyderabad. When the assailant pulled out the gun from a bag, Reddy’s associate Prasad Reddy who was sitting in the front passenger seat turned around and tried to grab the gun. In the scuffle the gun went off, bullets hit the windshield and one grazed Nityanand Reddy.
Police Commissioner Mahender Reddy said eight rounds went off. “We think during the scuffle between the assailant and one occupant in the car, the gun went off accidentally. No one was seriously injured. Realising that things were out of his control the assailant dropped the car and got out. Prasad Reddy also got out and tried to grab him but he hit his hands and fled across the road and disappeared. The gun was reported stolen from a Greyhounds Police camp last year,” Mahender Reddy said.
KBR park, opposite the TDP Bhavan is a favourite place for high profile morning walkers. film stars, politicians including former CM Kiran Kumar Reddy go there daily.

Economy would grow by 6.6 per cent in 2015: OECDOECD raises India growth outlook, urges reforms to return to 8 pc growth

India's economy will accelerate in 2015 but will fail to attain the heady growth rates of the past decade without sweeping structural reforms, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  ( OECD ) has said.
In a country survey, the Paris-based think tank forecast that India, which is Asia's third-largest economy would grow by 6.6 per cent in 2015, up from its last forecast of 5.7 per cent growth in May.
Growth would edge higher to 6.8 per cent in 2016, it said.
"The economy has shown signs of a turnaround and imbalances have lessened," the OECD said in the report which, while providing comfort to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that things are looking up, highlighted tough choices ahead.
Modi's election by a landslide earlier this year has lifted business confidence, while fiscal consolidation and easing pressures on inflation and the current account deficit all point in the right direction.
In its latest forecast, the OECD said it expected inflation to fall to 5.4 per cent in 2015 and nudge higher to 5.6 per cent the following year, after 6.9 per cent in 2014. In May, it forecast that inflation would remain above 6 per cent over the next few years.
Yet while current risks are broadly balanced, the medium- term outlook is less bright. Exports are constrained by supply-side bottlenecks, while high corporate borrowing and deteriorating asset quality at banks "may put the investment recovery at risk", the report added.
Huge barriers to growth, from infrastructure bottlenecks to restrictive labour laws to weak education, will hold India back if not addressed.
"Structural reforms would raise India's economic growth. In their absence, however, growth will remain below the 8 per cent achieved during the previous decade," the OECD said in the 158-page report.
In its key recommendations the OECD said India should:
- Improve the macroeconomic framework by introducing flexible inflation targeting, pursuing fiscal consolidation, implementing a national value-added tax and strengthening banking oversight.
- Boost manufacturing jobs by simplifying labour laws, improving access to education, accelerating approvals for infrastructure projects and improving the business climate.
- Increasing female economic participation by ensuring equal work opportunities for women and expanding access to education and skills training for female entrepreneurs.
- Improving access to, and the quality of, healthcare.
The OECD tracks its 34 advanced economy members, in addition to issuing forecasts and surveys of large non-member countries like India.

Shiv Sena slams Sharad Pawar over snap pollremarksBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 11:46 am
The Shiv Sena on Wednesday hit out at NCP Sharad Pawar after he asked his party to be ready for snap poll , saying he “is known for playing politics of distrust” and was trying to take advantage of the current instability.
Though NCP declared unconditional outside support to the minority BJP government the day Assembly poll threw up a hung verdict, party chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said that the state government’s stability was not NCP’s responsibility and asked party workers to be ready to face a snap poll.
“Sharad Pawar is taking advantage of this unstable government, but the Shiv Sena will stand firmly here. Let Pawar do whatever he wishes to. The Sena is fulfilling its role as an Opposition party honestly and with utmost sincerity,” an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said.
The Sena alleged that Pawar “is known for playing politics of distrust”, which is why he first gave support to the BJP and is now apparently threatening to withdraw it.
“Pawar thinks he can play politics as he wishes to and turn the political situation upside down. He wants to keep the future of the new government in his hands with 41 MLAs he has. Unstable government is the foundation of his politics. But the picture he has presented of the current political situation is laughable,” the Sena said.
Pawar’s words should not be taken seriously as he has a habit of saying something and doing something else, it said.
“He has the habit of creating an air of confusion and then gaining politically from it. This is his politics of survival,” the editorial said.
BJP has 121 MLAs in the Assembly having an effective strength of 287. With the backing of 41-member NCP, it had a comfortable majority. However, if NCP decides to withdraw support, it will be well short of the magic figure of 144 despite the backing of seven independents and some from smaller parties.

Morena: School principal booked for molesting teacher  forcing her to convert toChristianityPrint
Written by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal | Posted: November 19, 2014 11:32 am
A Hindu teacher in Morena has accused the principal of a Christian school of molesting her and also pressuring her to convert to Christianity.
The 31-year-old teacher filed a complaint with the Civil Lines Police Station, Morena, on Tuesday, alleging that Fr Dilip Nanda, in early 40s, keeps pressuring her to have illicit relations with him.
The complainant alleged that along with sister Brigette, the principal over the four-and-a-half years also tried to coerce her to change her faith. Her husband, also a teacher in the same school, accompanied her to the police station.
The couple alleged that the principal used to threaten them that they will be sacked if they spoke against him.
A few days ago, the principal had filed an application in the same police station apprehending that the couple could lodge a complaint against him by cooking up some charges.
Civil Lines Police Station in-charge Amit Singh Bhadoria told The Indian Express that the police could not have acted on the principal’s hypothetical application.
Bhadoria said the police have booked the principal under Section 354 of the IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the M P Freedom of Religion Act. Sister Brigette has also been booked under the anti-conversion law.
The police searched the father’s possible hideouts on Tuesday and early Wednesday but could not take him in custody.  Bhadoria said the police will also investigate all aspects of the case.

LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan Tuesday attacked ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh for considering “Dalits as its rivals and doing nothing for Muslims”, as he addressed party workers here as part of his attempt to increase party’s Lok Sabha tally from “six to 60”.
The LJP chief attacked both the SP and BSP.
Seeking to woo the Dalit vote bank in UP, Paswan alleged that BSP chief Mayawati did nothing for the community. “Mayawati had once given the slogan of ‘tilak-taraju aur talwar inko maro….At the time of polls she changed it to ‘haathi nahi Ganesh hai, Brahma Vishnu Mahesh hai’. The result was that neither the Dalits nor Brahmins are with her anymore,” Paswan said while addressing a meeting of his party workers here.
Paswan, who is Union minister for Food and Civil Supplies, also attacked SP for “opposing reservation in promotions”, saying Mulayam Singh Yadav considered Dalits as his rivals.
“All the parties except the SP had supported reservation in promotions in the Lok Sabha. Mulayam had opposed the Dalits in order to please upper castes,” Paswan claimed.
Paswan who is aiming to increase his party tally in Lok Sabha from the present “six to 60” by the next polls, questioned the Akhilesh Yadav government about the reservation his government had promised to Muslims during the polls. “How much quota has been granted by him to Muslims in the two-and-a-half year of government,” Paswan asked.
“They had been demanding 18 per cent reservation for Muslims from the Centre how much have they given in Uttar Pradesh,” he asked.
Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Paswan said Modi has said that it is his duty to provide security to minorities, Dalits, Muslims, Upper castes and women. “It is the result of the PM’s efforts that even Hurriyat faction is also ready for talks,” he said.
Paswan said that through his ministry, wheat was being provided at Rs two per kg and rice at Rs three per kg rice to all the states, and asked,”why it is not available in UP.

Arranging a marriage: how India does itPhoto: A.M. Faruqui
New numbers shed light on what the typical Indian marriage looks like
I wrote last week on inter-caste marriage and how just five per cent of women in the National Council for Applied Economic Research’s (NCAER) pan-India survey said that theirs had been an inter-caste marriage. The numbers got me thinking about arranged marriage which is another facet of marriage in India that we have very little data on.
The same round of the NCAER (2011-12), which I have advance access to, asked women if they knew their husbands before marriage. Around 18 per cent said that they did. The proportion is slightly higher for younger women and for those with more education. It's highest in Himachal Pradesh (56%), the northeastern States (50%) and Kerala (40%).
NCAER also asked women how many of them had a say in their marriage, something I wrote about earlier this year, and 60 per cent said that they did. We looked at those numbers in a detailed infographic here .
But neither knowing your husband before marriage nor having a say in your marriage necessarily makes it a “love marriage”. So I turn to a new survey that asked the question directly.
The International Centre for Women (ICRW) and United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) surveyed 9,205 men and 3,158 women for a study on masculinity and intimate partner violence which I wrote about last week . The survey covers eight States only – Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Gujarat and Maharashtra – but says that its sample is census-representative in those States. This survey directly asked men and women if theirs was an arranged marriage. Here’s what they answered.
Between arranged marriages that the man and/ or woman consented to and arranged marriages against their will, nearly 90 per cent of marriages in these States were arranged.
It’s interesting also to note the difference in the responses of men and women. The questions were not addressed to pairs of husbands and wives, and it looks like men are slightly more likely to perceive “agreement”, either of the couple or of elders, in the finalising of a marriage than women are.
So an arranged marriage, fixed by family elders, and consented to by the couple, would appear to be the most typical Indian marriage.

Gujarat declares new IT/ITES policy; targets 15-fold turnover jump by 2020The IT policy aims to increase the turnover of the state to 75,000 crore or USD 15 billion and create employment opportunities for 10 lakh persons by 2020.

With an aim to help “create an IT/ITeS ecosystem” in Gujarat and to attract new IT firms, the state government on Saturday declared a new Information Technology Policy (2014-19). This policy has a target of achieving an ambitious 15-fold increase in the state’s annual IT/ITES turnover, by 2020.
The IT policy aims to increase the turnover of the state to 75,000 crore or USD 15 billion and create employment opportunities for 10 lakh persons by 2020, stated state finance minister Saurabh Patel in a release here.
“At present there are about 1400 plus IT/ITES companies in Gujarat with a total annual turnover of USD 1 billion or Rs 6000 crore. With this policy we expect 500 new IT units to be set up in the state every year,” said a state government official.
Under this new policy, the state government will “duly facilitate allotment of land for IT/ITES units investing in the state.” Special provisions have been made for mega IT/ITES projects that have an investment size of Rs 50 crore (excluding the cost of land) and can provide employment to 1000 (for IT companies) and 1500 (ITES firms) persons. For those interested in developing IT/ITES technology parks the state government will give a 50 percent exemption in the fixed capital investment (cap of Rs 2.5 crore) in buildings and infrastructure facilities.
Among a slew of sops announced today, the state government will also provide all new IT/ITES companies with 100 percent relief in electricity duty for a period of five years from the date of commencement of operations. These units will also be given 100 percent exemption in stamp duty and registration fee for the sale/lease/transfer of land which will be limited to the first transcation.
About 30 percent subsidy — with a ceiling of five lakh per annum for two years — will be given. Moreover, 25 percent subsidy will also be given for new IT/ITES units who wish to set up their firms in IT parks.
Apart from this, 100 percent reimbursement will be given to the units on EPF deposited for women employees and 75 percent reimbursement in case of male employees (ceiling of Rs 5 lakh per annum).
Some of the provisions for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) units in Gujarat has been incorporated in this IT policy. This includes interest subsidy for five years, seven percent subsidy on a sum of up to Rs 25 lakh annually and a five percent subsidy for up to Rs 35 lakh for IT/ITES MSMES.
Encouragement will also be given to help the firms acquire new technology, get patents, quality certification, R&D and development of markets.
The state government also plans to establish a “start-up village or incubation centre” at one of more places in the state. “By declaring a separate IT/ITES, E-governance (declared today) and a continued…

Obamacare Train Not Wrecking As Sign-Up Period Kicks OffObamacare Train Not Wrecking As Sign-Up Period Kicks Off

MANASSAS, Virginia -- The website hasn't crashed, government officials aren't scrambling, and Americans are actually using the Obamacare exchanges to shop for health insurance. What a difference a year makes.
Open enrollment for the private health plans sold on HealthCare.gov , the online portal to exchanges for 37 states (including Virginia), and on the state-run exchanges for the other states started Saturday. Compared to Oct. 1, 2013, when the federal website and numerous state sites launched and immediately crashed -- frustrating consumers and giving Obamacare a black eye that still hasn't faded -- the beginning of the second sign-up period appears to be going smoothly.
"I am quite happy that we are where we are this morning," Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said during a brief news conference at Evergreen Health Center in Manassas, Virginia, on Saturday. "We are up and running."
In the eight hours since HealthCare.gov had re-opened for the three-month enrollment period at around 1:30 a.m. Eastern Time, the system had completed applications for 23,000 households, Burwell said at the press conference. Some consumers took the next step and selected a health insurance plan to use next year, but others still have to shop now that they have finished their applications for financial assistance, a department spokeswoman told reporters.
Burwell also noted that since HealthCare.gov's anonymous window-shopping tool went online last week, more than 1.2 million people had accessed it to obtain estimates of how much their insurance may cost.
Saturday did see some glitches on HealthCare.gov. Some new users experienced problems logging into their accounts, USA Today reported .
Given that HHS aims to sign up more than 9 million people for private health plans through the federally run exchange, 23,000 doesn't make a big dent either. But the deadline to buy coverage isn't until Feb. 15, and the deadline for plans that take effect on New Year's Day is still a month way. And approaching deadlines sparked huge surges in enrollments during the previous sign-up period.
Compared to last year, 23,000 is a huge number for Day 1. Just six people were able to enroll on the first day of the inaugural enrollment period because of technological failures that crippled the system. Only 106,000 enrolled during the whole month of October 2013. By April 2014, 8 million people had used health insurance exchanges to choose a health plan. More than 7 million were fully enrolled a month ago, as some consumers had given up their Obamacare plans either to switch to a different form of coverage or to go without, HHS announced earlier this month.
Jason Shriner said he enrolled in a plan for next year at Evergreen Health Center without much difficulty. "For the most part, it was fairly easy to use," said the 28-year-old from nearby Nokesville, who teaches baking classes for a living.
Shriner's current health plan isn't being offered next year, so he had to find something new -- and less expensive, because his income has gone down. He chose a "Silver" plan that's cheaper than the coverage he has now, he said.
"I'm super-excited about it. I mean, I'm going to be saving $100 a month. That's going to go a long way," said Shriner. Including a $219 monthly tax credit based on his income, he will pay about $25 a month for his insurance, which includes medical, dental and vision benefits, Shriner said.
The first year of Obamacare's health coverage expansion had a positive impact here in Northern Virginia, said Frank Principi, executive director of the Greater Prince William Community Health Center, which operates Evergreen Health Center in Manassas and Ridgewood Health Center in Woodbridge.
Before last year's enrollment period, 60 percent of the clinics' patients -- primarily Hispanic and African-American, Principi said -- had no health insurance. This year, that number is down to 52 percent, despite the problems with HealthCare.gov and despite the failure of Virginia to adopt the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid to more poor residents , Principi said.
"The first thing we say to the patient when they register in the waiting room is, 'Can we help you pay your medical bills?'" said Principi, who also is a Democratic member of the local county board of supervisors. Enrollment counselors working in the clinics helped 1,400 people sign up for coverage this year, Principi said, and he aims to get another 1,800 covered for 2015.
On Saturday, dozens of people occupied the waiting room and meeting rooms at the Manassas clinic to meet with enrollment counselors, and Principi expected 500 visitors by the end of the day's event. The health center had promoted the assistance in English and Spanish on local TV, radio and newspapers, as well as through social media channels and texts to patients, he said.
The people who visited Evergreen Health Center were a mix of those who need to renew existing coverage or switch to a new plan next year and those who currently have no health insurance, said Jabnia Murgado, of Woodbridge, who was one of the 14 enrollment counselors on hand. By mid-afternoon, Murgado had helped more than 10 people, though none who completed the process and enrolled in a plan.
Last time, clinic employees were forced to resort to filling out paper applications that they later entered into HealthCare.gov, but they weren't having serious issues on Saturday, Murgado said.
"The website is going great. I mean, there's always a little bit of glitches here and there, but the website is moving along. It has not stalled -- not as of yet, of course," she said. At times, the website ran slowly, and one consumer had to call the exchange's telephone hotline to get his password reset, she added.
In his weekly radio address on Saturday, President Barack Obama urged current exchange customers and the uninsured to visit HealthCare.gov.
"If you already buy insurance through the online marketplace, now is the time to take a look at some new options for next year. You might be able to save more money or find a plan that fits your family's needs better than the one you've got now," Obama said. "If you haven't signed up for insurance yet, this is your chance."
Obamacare officials at the federal and state level are strongly encouraging existing customers to review the health plans offered on the exchanges to avoid sticker shock. Although health insurance premium increases are in the single digits on average , there's a lot of variation. In particular, some of the least expensive and most popular plans in use now are those seeing the largest price hikes for next year , while other plans have reduced prices and more companies have entered this market.
HealthCare.gov now must cope with even greater loads than last year, as millions of consumers seek to renew their coverage and millions more attempt to sign up for the first time. Moreover, the sign-up period for 2015 runs only half as long as the initial enrollment period, which ran from October 2013 into April 2014.
The Obama administration has spent the time since that first round enhancing the system in anticipation of the next wave, adding new features and streamlining the application . States with poorly functioning websites, including Maryland and Massachusetts, also revamped their technology .
That doesn't mean officials expect this time around to be perfect, Burwell said Saturday.
"I will still always have some tension, certainly, for the next three months," the HHS secretary said. "We're going to continue to watch everything and monitor everything. As I've said all along, there will be places where we'll find things. What we're to do is quickly work to take care of anything we find."
Problems did arise Saturday. Washington Healthplanfinder, which serves Washington state residents, was miscalculating applicants' subsidies, forcing the entire system to be taken down, the state-run exchange announced in a press release just hours after enrollment began. A similar problem plagued Washington's exchange last time.
Burwell did not provide information about how many of the 23,000 applications were made by people renewing coverage versus potential new enrollees, about how many people were telephoning the federal exchange's call center and how long they waited to speak to a representative, or about how many users have visited the website.

First dissent on gas price  Gujarat firm demands higher rates'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
In first signs of dissent over the new gas pricing, Gujarat government firm GSPC has demanded market price for its output from KG basin fields saying it cannot be forced to sell fuel at a rate which is less than the cost of production.
Days after the October 18 government decision to raise natural gas prices to USD 5.61 per unit from USD 4.2, Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) shot off a letter to the Oil Ministry, demanding “market determined price” for its ready-to-produce Deen Dayal West (DDW) fields in Bay of Bengal.
“GSPC cannot be put to irreparable harm by directing it to sell at a gas price which is less than the cost of gas production (which includes exploration, development and production cost) from DDW field,” the company wrote.
The firm owned and run by the Gujarat government had last year discovered a market formula that gives a price of about USD 10.5 per million British thermal unit at current oil rate of USD 80 per barrel.
India is not endowed with rich natural resources and most of the reserves are in ultra-deep water, deepsea, and High Pressure-High Temperature (HPHT) areas which requires investment of substantial capital to develop the gas fields irrespective of time of discoveries.
Company, it said, “invested substantial capital in these areas with the assumption of having freedom for marketing the natural gas at market determined price which was the essential and most important feature of NELP contracts”.
GSPC had won the Block KG-OSN-2001/3 in the third round of auctions under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), which was launched by the BJP-led NDA government, in 2003. DDW field in the block was discovered in 2005-06.
“Even Government of India recognises the challenges involved in producing gas from High Pressure-High Temperature areas and has proposed premium for gas produced from such fields (in future). It is requested that same principles shall be applicable for DDW gas field and GSPC shall be allowed to sell gas at marker determined price,” it said.
This will help substitute the costly imported LNG.
GSPC said all facilities of DDW field are under commissioning and currently it was producing about 0.3 million standard cubic meters per day as commissioning gas.
Gas from DDW field, it said, is produced from most challenging conditions like HTHP and low permeability, requiring high capital and technology.
GSPC invested USD 3.2 billion in the field “with the expectation of having freedom for marketing the natural gas at market determined prices which was the essential and most important feature of NELP contracts,” it wrote.
“It may be noted that GSPC received bids for purchase of 35.96 mmscmd of gas above floor price of USD 8.5 (set in the price discovery process last year),” it added.

G20 commits to growth  fighting climate changePrint
World leaders prepared to release details of a plan aimed at injecting life into the world's listless economy.
Written by P Vaidyanathan Iyer | Brisbane | Posted: November 17, 2014 2:04 am | Updated: November 17, 2014 9:20 am
Leaders of the Group of 20 countries on Sunday agreed to take a variety of measures to add an extra $2 trillion or 2.1 per cent to world economic output and create millions of jobs by 2018.
Despite host Australia pitching hard to keep climate change outside the G20 agenda, US President Barack Obama brought conviction to its inclusion by announcing a $3 billion climate change fund for developing countries on Saturday. Japan followed suit by committing another $1.5 billion.
Suresh Prabhu, sherpa to Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, the incremental 2 per cent growth will come mainly from India, besides China. “The central issue is now employment as we always wanted; growth without jobs is meaningless,” he said. India will also significantly benefit from the higher growth as the global market opens up.
Another key area that India and other developing countries stressed upon was tackling shortfalls in investments and infrastructure, because these are critical to job creation. Accordingly, besides supporting the Global Infrastructure Initiative, the G20 leaders decided to strengthen public investment and create a more favourable climate for private sector investment in infrastructure.
On the inclusion of climate change in the G20 agenda, Prabhu said India too was facing an enormous challenge because of the past emissions.
Without answering a direct question if India too would face increasing pressure on cutting emissions, following a deal between the US and China, he said within developing countries India must pitch for common but differentiated responsibilities.
The Indian sherpa was also satisfied that there is focus now on the development agenda of the Doha round of trade talks.
“We had taken a firm but disciplined stance on the Bali package saying it cannot be implemented in a piecemeal fashion. Today, that has been appreciated by all,” Prabhu said.
Two days ahead of the summit, India and the US reached an understanding that New Delhi’s food security concerns would be addressed even as India decided to sign the Trade Facilitation Agreement.
The G20 communique took specific note of this. “We welcome the breakthrough between the US and India that will help the full and prompt implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement and includes provisions on food security. We commit to implement all elements of the Bali package and to swiftly decide a WTO work programme on the remaining issues of the Doha Development Agenda to bring negotiations back on track,” the communique said.
India and the other countries in the BRICS group also pushed hard for long-pending governance and share holding reform of the global institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. “These institutions must reflect the current realities of the structure of the global economy,” said Prabhu.
The G20 also agreed to include India’s demand for cutting the costs of remittances continued…

In the fight against black money  cyber security remains a weak linkPrint
Written by Subhomoy Bhattacharjee | New Delhi | Posted: November 17, 2014 2:06 am
Even as India has sharpened its offensive on black money this weekend at the G-20 summit, experts are pointing to the weakness in Indian cyber security architecture as a key problem in this regard.
In fact among the G20 nations meeting at Brisbane this weekend, India is a rare one that is still without an end-to-end cyber security system for its government including one for the Prime Minister’s Office. Top officials of the government working on the subject said they are aware of this lacuna in the security architecture.
The problem is compounded because no domestic entity has been able to offer a security system that can take care of espionage like the Edward Snowden variety of which India too was a victim.
Indian government cyber security agencies have recently found for instance that the finger print based RAX system to protect voice based communication has been jettisoned by several secretaries in whose offices it was installed, as the finger print reader suffered glitches not letting calls go through.
Kamlesh Bajaj, CEO of Data Security Council of India agreed that at present the security standards governing data communication between members of the Union Cabinet were below global benchmarks. “Unfortunately our policy says any entity communicating within the government can only offer a 40-bit encryption. But even the RBI or telecom companies offer 128-bit encryption, so there is an anomaly between what the policy is and what the actual security environment is”, he said.
Bajaj’s team working through The Software Alliance has just released recommendations on security standards government agencies should mandate from companies in the cyber sphere. He points to tax agencies as some of the most vulnerable ones.
Marcus Klische, security advisor, BlackBerry, says the espionage challenge staring the Indian government is similar to what the German or the US government faces. “No government will obviously go public with the level of risk it faces. But within a government the solutions need to be those which work unobtrusively,” he said without mentioning RAX.
He cites the example of German chancellor Angela Merkel whose conversations got tapped simply because she found it easier to use a non-secure device.
BlackBerry is, of course, an interested party in the debate as its key product is a secure communication system that governments like Germany and China have adopted to keep safe from prying eyes.
Speaking at Brisbane at the G-20 summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too touched on the need to stiffen cyber security standards.
Speaking about black money and the risk it creates for economies, he noted “Resilience of our financial system will also depend on (level of) cyber security.” Incidentally before speaking at the summit Modi had a long chat Merkel.
Bajaj, a former employee of the National Informatics Centre says there is no agency in India, not even the Intelligence Bureau which can decrypt communication algorithms of mails from abroad.
But Indian government mails were at risk, he said. “Broadly you could say a mail from within the Cabinet will not be a very secure mail,” he noted. Top officials of the continued…

RBI to cut rates by 25bps each in Feb  Apr: Goldman SachsThe change in Goldman Sach's rate cut view is largely because of the recent sharper than expected fall in headline inflation. (Reuters)
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 17, 2014 6:01 pm
The Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut key policy rates by 25 basis points each in February and April 2015 to bring the repo rate down to 7.5 per cent from 8 per cent currently, says a Goldman Sachs report.
“We have changed our rate call to build in 50 bps of rate cuts by the RBI in 1H2015 from our earlier call of RBI on hold,” Goldman Sachs said in a research note adding “we expect the RBI to cut by 25bps each in February and April”.
The global financial services major had earlier said that the central bank would keep its policy rates on hold.
The change in the global brokerage firm’s rate cut view is largely because of the recent sharper than expected fall in headline inflation, contained core prices, and no sharp increase in food prices despite a weak monsoon.
Goldman Sachs noted that the RBI would not launch into an even more aggressive rate cutting cycle due to three reasons — entrenched inflation expectations, uncertainty about commodity prices and a new inflation targeting framework.
Moreover, the global brokerage major said both the trajectory and level of headline consumer prices and wholesale prices will give some comfort to the RBI.
“We cut our FY16 CPI inflation forecast substantially, to 5.8 per cent from 7.0 per cent earlier,” it added.
Food prices are showing a lower trajectory than in previous few years, in part due to weak global agriculture prices, second round effects of weak fuel and transportation costs, and recent government measures to lower food prices such as lower minimum support price (MSP) increases.
“With these forecasts, we think the RBI can meet its 6 per cent target by January 2016. Near term risks to inflation are firmly to the downside. Given these forecasts, and the lags in transmission, we think the RBI will start cutting rates at its policy meeting in February,” the report said.
Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan in September policy review left all key rates unchanged citing continued risks to inflation and difficult external situation especially on the geopolitical front. This was the fourth consecutive time that the RBI has kept key interest rates unaltered.
The short-term lending rate (repo) rate remained at 8 per cent, and the cash reserve requirement of banks at 4 per cent.
RBI’s next policy review is on December 2.

BSE Sensex  Nifty scale new peaks; SBI  Tata Motors in limelightThe 30-share BSE Sensex after opening in negative zone dropped further to touch the day's low of 27,921.34 on profit-taking at high levels. (Reuters)

Indian stocks today galloped to new highs with benchmark Sensex surging 131.22 points to 28,177.88 and Nifty rising 40.85 points to end at 8,430.75 boosted by solid buying in bluechips, like SBI and Tata Motors, and positive cues on the trade deficit front.
The 30-share BSE Sensex after opening in negative zone dropped further to touch the day’s low of 27,921.34 on profit-taking at high levels and a weak trend at the other Asian bourses after data showed Japan slipped into recession.
Later, emergence of buying, spread over a broad front, helped the Sensex stage a strong comeback to hit an intra-day record high of 28,205.71, surpassing its earlier record of 28,126.48 reached on November 12. It settled for the day at 28,177.88, new record close, and gained 131.22 points or 0.47 per cent. Its previous record close was 28,046.66 (Nov 14).
Sentiment was boosted after stocks led by banking, power and capital sectors rallied. Trade deficit in October fell to USD 13.35 billion compared to USD 14.2 billion in September.
“Indian markets closed at new record high after trade deficit data narrowed…Growth story becomes very positive compared to its global peers. FII inflow should take markets to newer highs of 29000 on Sensex and 8700 On Nifty by December,” said Rajshekar Gowda, Senior Analyst, HBJ Capital.
Of the 30-share Sensex, 18 scrips ended with gains, while 12 others ended in negative zone. Country’s largest lender SBI rose by 5.44 per cent to close at its 52-week high of Rs 2,940.15. Other gainers which supported the key index to hit new highs include Tata Motors (up 4.07 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (2.15 per cent), NTPC (1.71 per cent), RIL (1.47 per cent), BHEL (1.20 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (1.04 per cent).
The 50-scrip NSE Nifty, after dipping to 8,349.10 at the outset, rebounded to breach the 8,400-mark to hit a new lifetime intra-day high of 8,438.10. It also ended at fresh all-time high of 8,430.75, up 40.85 points, or 0.49 per cent.
This beat its previous closing peak of 8,389.90 touched on November 14. Also, its previous intra-day record high was 8,415.05 on November 12.
Foreign Portfolio Investors had bought shares worth a net Rs 645.90 crore last Friday, according to provisional data.

India’s exports contracted by 5.04 per cent to USD 26 billion in October while imports grew by 3.62 per cent, pushing up the trade deficit as gold imports shot up during the month.
Imports during the month were USD 39.45 billion, as against USD 38.07 billion in October 2013.
Gold imports last month jumped to USD 4.17 billion from USD 1.09 billion a year ago. The 280.39 per cent growth in gold imports has pushed the trade deficit to USD 13.35 billion in October, from USD 10.59 billion in the corresponding period last year.
During April-October period of the current fiscal, the country’s exports are up 4.72 per cent to USD 189.79 billion, while imports are up 1.86 per cent to USD 273.55 billion.
Trade deficit during the seven month period of 2014-15 stands at USD 83.75 billion as against USD 87.31 billion in the same period last fiscal.

FII stake in Sensex companies hits all-time peak of 27 pct: BofA-MLBy: Press Trust of India | Posted: November 17, 2014 12:37 pm
Maintaining a bullish stance on Indian equities, foreign investors increased their exposure in BSE Sensex companies to an all-time high of 27 per cent in the September quarter, says a report.
According to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch report, strong inflows from the FIIs over the last five years have resulted in all-time high foreign ownership for the Indian markets.
“FII stake in Sensex companies has been rising continuously since 2009,” the global financial services major said in a research note, adding the FII stake stood at an all-time peak of 27 per cent as of September 30.
FIIs continued to invest in India in the September quarter albeit at a slower pace. Moreover, this was the 8th consecutive quarter of positive inflows from the FIIs.
As of June 2014, FIIs collectively held around 22.5 per cent of the market and around 46 per cent of the free float.
In comparison, FIIs held around 15 per cent of total market cap and 36 per cent of free float in March 2009.
A sector-wise analysis shows that financials continue to remain the highest overweight sector for the FIIs, while software and energy are the biggest underweight sectors.
“We are positive on energy sector reforms and believe positive progress on it could lead to FII buying in PSU oil companies,” the report added.
Most bought sectors by the FIIs were: consumer, telecom, software and financials. On the other hand most sold sector by the FIIs were: industrials, cement and metals.
The global brokerage major said the consensus bullishness creates the biggest risk to markets. BofA-ML added that “the good news, however, is that domestic mutual funds have seen inflows and have been buyers post-elections after being net sellers in past few years”.
The 30-share Sensex, today slipped by 44.51 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 28,002.15 in early trade. The gauge had closed at a record high of 28,046.66 in the previous session on Friday on sustained foreign fund inflows and positive economic data.

Queensland to announce major infra investment to help Adani  GVK develop coal minesBy: Press Trust of India | Brisbane | Posted: November 17, 2014 10:54 am
Australia’s Queensland state will announce a major investment in rail infrastructure in the Galilee basin to ensure that one of the mega-mines proposed by India’s Adani group and GVK get a clearance next year.
Queensland Premier Campbell Newman, who held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi here last night, said he was prepared to invest in capital works to ensure that the projects get off the ground.
The offer came even as the G20 leaders affirmed their commitment to boosting energy efficiency and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies that encouraged wasteful consumption.
Modi during his intervention at the G20 summit had pushed for energy efficiency.
The G20 communique said energy ministers would meet in 2015 to tackle energy efficiency strategies including boosting gas production.
Queensland is expected to scrap its first-mover royalty discount for big players in the Galilee basin, announced last year, and replace it with infrastructure commitment for common user infrastructure, according to Australian media.
The three proposed mega-projects in the Galilee Basin– Adani’s 16.5 billion dollars Carmichael mine, GVK’s six billion dollars Alpha mine and Clive Palmer’s 6.4 billion dollars Waratah coal — is expected to create 28,000 jobs.
Queensland Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney has been quoted as having said that coal-producing countries from across the world were trying to get a foot into India and therefore it was in the government’s interest to facilitate the Galilee developments.
The Galilee Basin mines are 500 kms from ports on the east coast.
The move by Queensland comes even as Indian industrialist Gautam Adani is expected to make an announcement on financing for its 16.5 billion dollars Carmichael mine, rail and port development.

NBFC governance and transparency: Reserve Bank takes a step forwardAs the RBI has tightened the systemic loopholes in the NBFC sector, the ultimate beneficiaries will be depositors and investors. Thinkstock
Written by George Mathew | Posted: November 17, 2014 2:18 am | Updated: November 17, 2014 11:02 am
Three years after a panel headed by former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Usha Thorat proposed stringent norms for non-banking financial companies, the RBI has finally acted. The central bank has implemented higher capital requirements, regulatory alignment with banks, enhanced disclosure requirements and tighter corporate governance norms — all measures that will strengthen the NBFC sector structurally and safeguard the interests of customers and investors.
True, the latest RBI measures will impact profitability and asset quality of NBFCs in the short term, but they will bring in more transparency and improve NBFCs ability to withstand asset quality shocks in the long run, analysts and rating companies say.
As the RBI has tightened the systemic loopholes in the NBFC sector, the ultimate beneficiaries will be depositors and investors. The revised guidelines prescribe material enhancement in disclosure levels for large NBFCs and several changes in corporate governance practices. These are largely in line with some of the norms applicable to banks. Better transparency and corporate governance will reduce information risk and will enhance stakeholder confidence in the NBFC sector.
The central bank has reduced the limit on deposit acceptance to 1.5 times of Owned Funds from 4 times of Owned Funds for deposit-taking asset financing companies and made mandatory investment grade credit rating for accepting public deposits.
“Mandatory investment grade credit rating helps to safeguard depositors. The limit on deposits improves safety for public depositors. However, majority of deposit taking NBFCs are already compliant,” said a study by Care Ratings.
It says governance and disclosure norms will improve corporate governance and accountability of systemically important NBFCs and improve transparency. It will also ensure the availability of important information to investors who were short-changed on many occasions due to lack of transparency and inadequate flow of information.
The RBI has ensured checks and balances for NBFCs which collect deposits and important non-deposit taking NBFCs. Deposit taking NBFCs (NBFC-D) with deposits over Rs 20 crore should constitute an audit committee, a nomination committee to ascertain the fit and proper status of directors and the risk management committee.
Non-deposit taking NBFCs (NBFC-ND) with assets of Rs 50 crore and above should constitute an audit committee, while NBFC-ND with asset over Rs100 crore should constitute a nomination committee and risk management committee in addition to the audit committee. NBFC-D with deposits over Rs 50 crore should rotate the partners in the statutory audit firm, once in every three years.
NPAs set to touch R29,600 crore
Banks will take a hit following the changes in norms governing non-performing assets (NPAs) and provisioning of NBFCs. The RBI has tightened the NPA recognition and provisioning norms for NBFCs so as to bring them on a par with those applicable for banks. Gross NPAs are set continued…

BSE Sensex retreats from record high on profit-bookingBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 17, 2014 10:24 am
The benchmark BSE Sensex retreated from record high to trade 44 points lower in early trade today on emergence of profit-booking, mainly in healthcare, IT, banking, capital goods and oil and gas sector stocks amid weak Asian cues.
The 30-share Sensex, which had gained 106.02 points in the previous session on Friday, slipped by 44.51 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 28,002.15 in early trade. The gauge had closed at a record high of 28,046.66 in the previous session on Friday on sustained foreign fund inflows and positive economic data.
In a similar fashion, the NSE Nifty slipped from record high by losing 18.25 points, or 0.22 per cent, to trade at 8,371.65. It closed at a life-time high of 8,389.90 in the previous session.
Brokers said emergence of profit-booking by participants at record levels and lower-than-expected earnings posted by some blue-chip companies pulled down the key indices from record highs.
Besides, a weak trend at the other Asian markets, after data showed Japan’s economy had slipped into recession, too weighed on trading sentiments here, they said.
In the Asian region, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell by 0.40 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei Index edged lower by 2.59 per cent.
The US Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.10 per cent lower on Friday.

Govt orders quality checks on Chinese steelPrint

Written by Priyadarshi Siddhanta | New Delhi | Posted: November 17, 2014 2:07 am | Updated: November 17, 2014 10:34 am
Acting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s directive to curb needless imports, the finance ministry has directed that specific Chinese steel products must be subjected to stringent quality checks before allowing them to enter the country’s hinterland.
In an order issued to the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) on November 7, the finance ministry has said that Indian importers buying Chinese steel products like thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) bars, used extensively by the realty sector, will henceforth have to compulsorily secure certification by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) at all entry points to the country.
The move is specifically aimed at Chinese steel makers exporting steel by adding boron in their product mix to bypass the defined quality standards of the steel ministry’s Quality Control Order 2012 and the commerce ministry’s import duty.
The Indian Express had reported on September 18 that steel ministry had expressed serious concerns over the burgeoning steel imports from China which during the second quarter of 2014-15 exceeded “the historic (quarterly) high” of 90 million tonnes.
The Indian Steel Association (ISA), the newly created umbrella body of the country’s leading steel companies, has written to the government on November 4 cautioning that imports of hot rolled coils, sheets and plates are up by 41 per cent in the first half of the current fiscal of which imports from China amounts to 111 per cent.
Of the total imports Boron added steel accounted for 80 per cent imports from China. Imports of colour coated steel from China has surged by 117 per cent in the first half of this fiscal, while wire rod imports have shot up by 110 per cent, the ISA said in its letter.

Bigg Boss 8: Gautam turns dictator  how will the housemates reactGautam is provided access to a luxurious fully equipped room from where he will rule the house.
By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 18, 2014 4:21 pm | Updated: November 18, 2014 5:25 pm
Day 58 in the ‘Bigg Boss’ house, brings with it new changes. There will now be a King who will rule over his subjects in the controversial house.
As the contestants get done with breakfast, Bigg Boss introduces the luxury budget task of the day, ‘Gautam City’. Since Gautam is now made a strict dictator of the house, it has been converted into his kingdom. As his special privilege, Gautam is provided access to a luxurious fully equipped room from where he will rule the house.
He is also given the special privilege of choosing two royal guards by his side. As per the rules, Gautam has the special authority to handcuff the housemates if he wants to punish them and can also take away their food. The Dictator is also given the freedom to do as he likes in the house. Also, no one in the house can address him by name. As per the rule, they will only address him as ‘Your Highness’ or ‘Your Majesty’.
Since, Gautam is the Dictator, Bigg Boss has covered the house with multiple posters of him all over the house along with a special statues of Gautam in his famous shirtless avatar.
 
The housemates are shocked to see the posters with words such as ‘My City My Rule’, ‘Karo Ya Maro’, ‘Mera Sheher Mera Kahar’ written on them.
A delighted Gautam is over the top and jumps into action as he chooses various tasks to raise the entertainment levels within the house. And that is how Gautam City is formed in all its glory.
Diandra, Upen, Karishma and Nigaar among others, are least interested in forming the subjects of Gautam City. They find it difficult to take in the rules being created by Gautam for the task.
However, be it punishing the praja by making them stand in the sun for hours or asking them to give up their belongings, Gautam does it all. Gautam is in full swing to take his praja by storm and is determined to let them have a taste of the ‘Misunderstood Gautam’ to the fullest and change their perception of him. How will the subjects react to Gautam rule?

The Marxist-Leninist militants linked to the Jerusalem synagogue attackBy Ishaan Tharoor November 18 Follow @ishaantharoor

It's not clear at present which, if any, Palestinian militant organization was behind Tuesday's attack  at an Orthodox synagogue in Jerusalem. The incident led to at least four deaths, including those of three Israeli-American citizens.
But the two men who carried it out are now believed to have ties to  the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades , the armed wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Marxist-Leninist guerrilla group. Udai Abu Jamal and Ghassan Abu Jamal, said to be cousins, were shot dead by police after they burst into a synagogue in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood, wielding axes, knives and guns. The Islamist group Hamas praised the attack but did not take credit for it. Israeli authorities have authorized the demolition of the assailants' homes in east Jerusalem, a tactic they believe will dissuade other militants.
The PFLP dubbed the attack a "heroic operation," according to Reuters . The latest communique on its English language Web site is dated from Nov. 13; in it, the organization urges an "escalation of uprising" in the West Bank and Jerusalem, a city which has seen a sharp rise in tensions  between Arabs and Israeli Jews in recent months.
The group is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and other Western countries, but its ideology has very little in common with Hamas, whose jihad against Israel has blown hot and cold over the past two decades. Its legacy is a reminder of the older, secular nature of Palestinian militancy against Israel and Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza since the 1960s.
The PFLP was founded in 1967 by George Habash , a Palestinian Orthodox Christian animated by the pan-Arabism of then Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser and the insurgent socialism that inflamed anti-colonial struggles in many parts of the world at the time. At its peak, the PFLP was one of the leading factions within the Palestinian Liberation Organization, alongside the Fateh party of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas, the beleaguered current president of the Palestinian Authority.
The group won notoriety through a string of plane hijackings, as well as bombings and assassinations. In September 1970, PFLP militants went on a spree of hijackings, eventually landing three captured airliners with 310 passengers, including 86 American citizens, on a dusty airstrip in Jordan. After a week-long standoff, the passengers were freed, while the militants detonated the empty jets, an explosive act of agit-prop that brought the Palestinian struggle center-stage.
"Startling footage of the jets' fiery obliteration led the evening newscasts on all three American networks," writes journalist Brendan Koerner in his book, "The Skies Belong to Us: Love and Terror in the Golden Age of Hijacking." "The  nation's major newspapers, meanwhile, ran front-page photos of jubilant guerrillas dancing on the planes' blackened wreckage."
The incident precipitated a crackdown by Jordan that drove the PLO out of that country and nearly sparked a regional conflagration with Syria and Israel.
PFLP militants were involved in a number far more grisly attacks in conjunction with Marxist-Leninist allies. In 1972, along with fighters from the Japanese Red Army , they gunned down two dozen people at the international airport in the Israeli city of Lod. Four years later, along with German radicals in the  Baader-Meinhof Gang , they hijacked an Air France plane bound for Tel Aviv and diverted to Entebbe, Uganda. A daring Israeli commando raid led to the rescue of most of the hostages (three were killed) and the deaths of all seven hijackers, as well 20 Ugandan troops.
The PFLP's star began to wane with the collapse of the Soviet Union, a firm backer, the advent of the Oslo Peace Process and the emergence of Hamas. Some argue Israel played a role in enabling the Islamists' rise , seeing it as a hedge against the leftist radicalism of other Palestinian factions.
But the PFLP persisted with its activities: in 2001, it assassinated Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi, an act the organization claimed was revenge for Israel's targeted killing of Mustafa Zibri, who had just succeeded an ailing Habash. Its following leader, Ahmed Saadat, was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in 2002 and still languishes in Israeli prison.
The PFLP has been involved in a number of suicide bombings in the early 2000s, but insist it has now abandoned the tactic. Fighters linked to the organization were among those firing rockets into Israel from Gaza during hostilities earlier this year.
Given Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's determination to use a " heavy hand " in reprisal for Tuesday's synagogue attack, it's likely the situation may deteriorate further. The lack of progress in talks between Netanyahu's right-wing government and Abbas's camp has led to many fearing the outright collapse of the two-state solution.
That plays into the rhetoric of groups like the PFLP.
"We do not want more blood, but are obliged to resist," said Leila Khaled, one of the PFLP's most famous hijackers , in an interview earlier this year . "We have the right to live in our homeland. When the Israelis realize that as long as they do not budge this conflict will be endless, they should accept our solution."

Ted Cruz  Al Franken SlugfestTed Cruz Hits Back At Al Franken On Net Neutrality
Posted:
reddit
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) responded on Monday to comments made by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) about net neutrality, the latest exchange in what is becoming an ongoing, public back-and-forth. The debate began when Cruz dubbed the concept "Obamacare for the Internet." Franken said in an interview on Sunday that Cruz has no idea what he's talking about.
“When [Cruz] says this is the Obamacare -- Obamacare was a government program that fixed something, that changed things,” Franken said. “This is about reclassifying something so it stays the same. This would keep things exactly the same that they've been.”
In a video provided to The Huffington Post, Cruz, a conservative Texas Republican, shoots back at Franken, a liberal Minnesota Democrat, seizing on Franken's explanation that net neutrality is not a new regulatory regime, but rather would keep the Internet "the same" as it always has been.
Watch Cruz's response to Franken, above.
Last week, President Barack Obama called on the Federal Communications Commission to reclassify the Internet as a utility similar to electricity or water.
For Cruz, a champion collegiate debater, Franken's use of the phrase "the same" is proof that net neutrality regulation is anathema to innovation.
"We want a whole lot more of this," Cruz says in the video, waving an iPhone in the air, which he used as a proxy for innovation that can occur in the absence of government regulation. "And a whole lot less of this," he adds, pointing to a rotary phone, a symbol of an industry he says was "frozen in place" by regulation.
Cruz's argument, though, relies on a different reading of what "the same" means. Franken is arguing that the Internet will be just as open to innovation as it always has been, since net neutrality has always been in effect and will remain in effect. Indeed, it would be hard to make the case that the Internet's current regulatory structure has made innovation impossible. Cruz instead is re-appropriating the phrase to imply that the Internet as a whole will never be able to change from the way it is now.
But on a more general level, Cruz is embedding his argument in populist terms, condemning the involvement of the FCC, which he calls an unelected commission "influenced by lobbyists and politicians and unaccountable to regular, working Americans."
It's also worth noting that it's not clear that the rotary phone's failure to evolve was a result of overregulation. Perhaps more important was the monopoly AT&T had over the industry until the courts broke it up.
By taking such a firm stand against net neutrality -- which even the telecom companies say they're for rhetorically -- Cruz is putting at risk the GOP's longterm effort aimed at cleaving Silicon Valley companies away from Democrats.
Net neutrality refers to the idea that Internet service providers should not be allowed to charge companies different rates for the same amount of data across the network. Doing so could allow big companies to buy faster speeds for their own data, while startups face slower download speeds, preventing them from gaining traction. Tilting the field against startups and small players, Franken argues, stifles innovation.

WATCH Kevin Hart Tell Jameis Winston To  Stop Doing Dumb Sh*tHart was visiting Florida State University last weekend for a performance when he met with some football players, including the troubled Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Winston, TMZ reported.
Hart also launched into a bit about Winston's crab legs-stealing incident from last spring.
Was Winston amused? You be the judge.
Hart's ribbing of the Seminoles star appears to be a bit less inspirational than the visit Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey paid to the Texas Longhorns earlier this season. Then again, the Seminoles don't seem to require a pep talk. They beat Miami on Saturday to remain unbeaten and on course for a possible second straight national championship.
Winston has delivered victories on the field and controversy off it.
In addition to stealing crab legs from a supermarket last April, he was suspended for one game earlier this season for yelling obscenities in the student union. He is also scheduled to face a Student Code of Conduct disciplinary hearing Dec. 1 over a 2012 rape accusation, a controversial case in which criminal charges were not filed. His accuser is expected to testify.

A Single Kiss Can Transfer WAY More Germs Than You Ever Knewreddit
Kissing just got a whole lot less romantic--at least for germaphobes.
A new study shows that a single French kiss can transfer up to 80 million bacteria from one person to another.
For the study, 21 couples visiting a zoo in Amsterdam were asked to lock lips for 10 seconds. Before the kiss, one member of each couple drank a yogurt drink containing specific strains of bacteria. After the kiss, the researchers swabbed the mouth of the partner who hadn't drunk the yogurt, and then did a bacterial count of the strains from the yogurt to arrive at the 80 million figure.
That certainly sounds icky. But before you swear off your sweetheart's lips, you should know that there's nothing inherently dangerous about transferring germs. In fact, the researchers say it can be a good thing.
"If you increase the diversity of good bacteria, you can increase resistance against infection," lead study author Dr. Remco Kort , a microbiologist at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research and a professor of microbial genomics at the University of Amsterdam, told The Huffington Post. "We know that one of the functions of the bacteria we cary with us is they’re protecting us from disease-carrying microorganisms. From this point of view, it could be healthy."
The findings inspired the creation of a "Kiss-O-Meter" at the Micropia museum in Amsterdam, which allows visitors to measure how many bacteria, and what kinds, they exchange during a kiss.
(Story continues below image.)
Dr. Remco Kort, the lead author of a new study of kissing, stands near the Kiss-O-Meter that was developed for Amersterdam's Micropia museum.
"We all associate microorganisms with unhygienic conditions, and food spoilage or disease, but part of the mission [of the museum] is to show their benefits." Kort said. "It would be good to get to know them because they play an essential role in our bodies. Microorganisms evolved on our planet for billions of years and they may provide solutions for human problems."
The study was published online today in the journal Microbiome.

There are other benefits to listening well. One is demonstrating care. Effective listening conveys a sense that the leader is interested in her people, their thoughts, opinions and concerns. A leader also builds stronger commitment within others when people feel that she cares about them personally as well as in how they fit within the organization.
What can leaders do to become better listeners and gain the feedback, confidence, support and buy-in that they seek?
See eye to eye - One crucial element of good listening is making strong eye contact. We discussed the importance of this when we detailed how to make a positive first impression. By fixing your eyes on the speaker you will avoid becoming distracted while also demanding genuine attention. Eye contact is an important element of all face-to-face communication, even if you know the speaker well. Visibly put away possible distractors such as your phone. This communicates that there is nothing more important to you right now than this conversation.
Use receptive body language - Without saying a word, our bodies communicate much about attitudes and feelings. We need to be aware of this in any conversation that we have. If seated, lean slightly forward to communicate attention. Nod or use other gestures or words that will encourage the speaker to continue. Always be careful to maintain an appropriate distance between you and the speaker. Being too close may communicate pushiness or lack of respect. If you remain distant, you may be seen as cold or disinterested. Body postures matter too in most cultures. The crossing of one's arms or legs, for example, often conveys close-mindedness.
Stop talking and start listening - This is a most basic listening principle and oftentimes the hardest to abide by. When somebody else is talking it can be very tempting to jump in with a question or comment. This is particularly true when we seek to sound informed, insightful or if we start to feel defensive due to the speaker's criticisms. Be mindful that a pause, even a long one, does not necessarily mean that the speaker has finished. Let the speaker continue in their own time; sometimes it takes a few moments to formulate what to say and how to say it. Never interrupt or finish a sentence for someone. Patient listening demonstrates that you respect others, which is the first step in building trust and rapport. Remember, if you desire to be listened to, then give others the courtesy of listening to them first.
Humbly take on their point of view - Approach each conversation from the vantage point of the speaker. Seek to empathize and to objectively consider their position, regardless of their rank. Be humble enough to listen carefully, even if you disagree with what is being said. Remember that those that confront and challenge you are ultimately the ones who help you stretch and develop most. True wisdom doesn't see opposition, only opportunity.
Summarize and clarify - When the other person has finished talking take a moment to restate and clarify what you have heard. Use language like, "so, to summarize, you said..." End by asking whether you heard correctly, which will encourage immediate feedback. Not only will this ensure the clearest takeaway on your end, but it will help the speaker feel genuinely heard and valued.  A strategically placed pause at some point in the feedback can be used to signal that you are carefully considering the message that was just shared.
Leave the door open - Keep open the possibility of additional communication after this conversation has ended. You never know when new insights or concerns may emerge.
Thank them for approaching you - Do not take any conversation for granted. For many employees, requesting a meeting requires that they summon much courage and rehearse their message time and again. Moreover, you probably learned something useful and meaningful during your talk, information or ideas that may help you as the leader. Few things go as far in building good will as genuinely expressing appreciation.
Create a listening culture - While all of the above strategies can help leaders make the most of listening opportunities, leaders also need to take steps to create a broader culture in which listening (and therefore communicating) is valued and desired. Cultures typically do not evolve. They are the product of conscious decisions and behaviors that over time become part of the fabric of communal and organizational life. Leaders who actively encourage others to speak, at meetings, by setting up one-to-one meetings, etc. will not only be more likely to really know what people are thinking but will improve morale and increase worker motivation in the process.

Clara Chen: Stay Ahead of the Culture by Creating Itreddit
This is part of the #CareerAdvice series -  featuring successful professionals who share their advice to people who would want to take their career to the next level.
Fresh from the success of her previous startup, there's no stopping the millennial entrepreneur Clara Chen to conquer the next challenge -  being the CEO of the influencer marketing and content management platform in Asia Pacific, Influr .
She's no newbie in the digital marketing and publishing space having started her career in 2004 with media conglomerates in the Asia Pacific such as Fox, Viacom and Channel News Asia.
At the age of 27, she had a taste of what most entrepreneurs could mostly only hope for - successful exit from her first fashion startup. Not resting in her laurels, she's now off to carving another success in an industry she's had more than 10 years of experience in and allowing brands and influencers take part in digital conversations that help boost creativity and productivity at work.
Clara shares with us the importance of determining one's passion, getting other involved in the process and  how staying ahead of the culture helps entrepreneurs create it.
Can you tell us a bit about how you started your career? What are some of your best moments in your professional life?
I started in the digital media industry across Southeast Asia in 2004, had the privilege to work in media conglomerates like Viacom International Media Networks, Channel NewsAsia and Fox International Channels since. It was early days for digital media in 2004, and I was fortunate to have the opportunity to grow and learn with the industry.
Clara Chen, CEO at Influr
Out of pure passion, I left the industry for 2 years to start out on my own in my first fashion startup adventure in 2009. I moved to London to work with fashion designers in major European Fashion Weeks, and learnt about cultural sensitivity and small business innovation.
In 2013, when I turned 29, I ventured into marketing technology and founded influr.com on a simply philosophy - to give the rewards and recognition back to content creators. The hook for influr.com is making our users money, and giving them the opportunity to become microentrepreneurs through content creation.
The best moments in my professional life are made up by the people around me - bosses who became friends, neighbors who turned into advisors, amazing co-workers who supported my vision and great mentors to guide me through each journey. I also really enjoyed working with people who create things for a living - in whichever discipline - their energy and passion can be infectious. I hope that I'll have the opportunity to do the same for other young entrepreneurs in the future.
If you could advise your 20-year-old-self today, what would tell her?
Not all of us will change the world, but we can all build a network of people who are going to change it.
What has been the most valuable advice you've ever gotten when you were facing challenges in your career?
Don't be afraid to ask for help.
What would you advice the millennial just starting with their career or aiming to take their careers to the next level?
For millennial just starting with their careers or aiming to take their careers to the next level, I'll urge them to venture out into the world and find out more ways of doing things. With the internet, the world has shrunk and therefore we should widen our horizons by leaving our comfort zones.
We should take risks in our careers as early and as often as possible. We are all a sum of our experiences, and they give us a better worldview and perspectives.
Everything is made slowly and in pain. The only way to success is keeping to a plan, however difficult it may be. So stick to a routine and just show up everyday.
All the hype about innovation is really the result of collaboration. Sharing allows us to be more free, more flexible, less limited and more democratic, and the most brilliant idea is born from a multitude of good ideas. Don't be afraid to share your idea, no matter how good or bad you think it may be. The more you engage others in it, the more they can help you formulate and validate your idea, and the more you can learn.
Finally, stay ahead of the culture by creating the culture.

Why Instagram Mattersreddit
"Twitter is stupid and Instagram is Twitter for people who can't read" -- 2 Broke Girls
I disagree. Until last week I never heard this quote before and now every time I watch a CBS television show on demand I am tormented by those words.
Some of my friends know I have spent most of 2014 living inside of Instagram. At times it feels like I am on Instagram for several hours a day. I know I changed because these days when I wake up in the morning I go onto Instagram first before checking my email.
Inside the world of advertising, the advertising, PR, Marketing worlds grew up with the terms "earned media" and "paid media." Paid media is advertising that is paid for. Earned media is the opposite. It happens when someone writes a story on a media platform about a product, person, place, thing, and service without economic compensation. In the era of Instagram I have discovered another form of media, "Love Media." Imagine a world where the customer will share a photograph of their food, their sneakers, their hotel room, their camera, their clothing and more with their friends and community without payment or any expectation of payment. They are driven by love. On any given day, millions of people are sharing their love for a product, service, food, TV show, movie and more with their communities on Instagram. The amount of sharing is growing. And as 2014 nears the end, it is all about love.
As a marketing professional, your challenge is to find a way to leverage the love from your customers into something meaningful. Figure out how to best approach this and Instagram can be a great marketing channel for future product rollouts. The success of Instagram is disruptive to marketing strategies, which are passive. The idea of building bottom up community is still foreign to many. Yet in 2015 community will have an even bigger role. Use Instagram to build your contacts and as a channel to connect to your customer community.
These days I am working with a number of owners of restaurants in Manhattan on their Instagram strategy. These are restaurant owners who recognize that an active Instagram strategy is more important than begging for reviews on Yelp. This is the profile of the kind of person I prefer to work with since they intuitively understand Instagram is where the buzz is. And Instagram is where they need to be.
Inside of the food industry, Instagram is magical. Imagine discovering a new dish tonight because one of your Instagram friends scored a reservation in the hot new gluten free vegan spot in the Lower East Side. Imagine being able to click on the location inside the photo and see 25 other mouth-watering dishes. Food discovery via Instagram is viral and a game changer for foodies and business owners.
In a world of 140 Characters, Twitter continues to be a powerful platform. But in a platform where a picture is worth a thousand words, adding a story in the description of a photo turns each Instagram post into a short form novel. And something meaningful for the future.

Stop BJP  keep smiling  says BabbarRaj Babbar waves to his audience in Hajin, where he campaigned for Imtiaz Parray on Tuesday. (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)
Written by Adil Akhzer | Hajin(sonawari) | Posted: November 19, 2014 12:57 am
Congress campaigner Raj Babbar mocked Narendra Modi’s programmes in Australia while attacking the BJP and urging Kashmiris to stop the party’s march. “I just want to say that he is dancing at a stadium in Australia when women are dying in Chhattisgarh,” he said of Modi.
He said the country is passing through a “tough phase”. “There are forces that have risen in New Delhi and want to bring disappointment to the smiling faces in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, the way they have done in Hindustan,” the actor-politician said while campaigning for candidate Imtiaz Parray at Hajin in north Kashmir. “Only your happy faces can stop the evil powers that have risen in Delhi.”
Around 5,000 people had assembled in the audience. Babbar, who was accompanied by Congress general secretary Moin-ul-Haq and state party president Saifuddin Soz, greeted them with a salaam. “With folded hands, I have come here to request you to press the button for the palm and give Imtiaz victory,” he said. “Please use your right index finger for prosperity, welfare and righteousness… I am happy about the enthusiasm in the youth here; they realise only the Congress can work for prosperity of the people of Kashmir.”
Soz told the gathering that the country is being run by the RSS, not the BJP. “Through newspapers it is being said that the BJP will win 44 seats, and now 50,” he said. “I am saying with full assurance that Kashmir will not let Modi win any seat here.”

Indian-American Neha Gupta wins prestigious children s peace prizePrint
Neha Gupta, an 18-year-old Indian-American, won the presigious International Children's Peace Prize.
By: Press Trust of India | New York | Posted: November 18, 2014 11:40 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 6:31 am
Neha Gupta, an 18-year-old Indian-American, won the presigious International Children’s Peace Prize for her work to help orphans in India and other vulnerable children.
Gupta won the award whose last year’s winner was Malala Yousufzai, who went on to win this year’s Nobel Peace Prize.
Gupta from Philadelphia became the first ever American to be awarded the Children’s International Peace Prize in The Hague, Netherlands.
She was awarded the prize by Nobel Peace Laureate Desmond Tutu at a ceremony in The Hague.
The prize is awarded annually to a child, anywhere in the world, for his or her dedication to children’s rights.
Gupta began her astounding work when she was just a child herself, visiting her parents’ native place India nine years ago.
Carrying out a family tradition of celebrating birthdays by delivering gifts to orphans, she was struck by the condition these children were living in.
Last week, in an interview to ABC News, Gupta said: “The place was just really in shambles. I didn’t want to accept these things. These are things i wanted to fix.”
She moved to fix them quickly, any way that she could.
Back home in Pennsylvania, she made a bold move, deciding to sell all of her toys to raise money for the orphans she had met in India.
“We just put it out on our driveway and people came, bought things and it turned out to be such a successful event,” Gupta said.
“From that one event we raised USD 700 and I’ve wanted to keep going,” she said.
Gupta kept going, selling crafts door to door and collecting corporate donations in her father’s SUV.
Nine years later, now an 18-year-old college student, she runs Empower Orphans, a global charity that has raised USD 1.3 million.
The organisation reaches orphans in the US and abroad, helping to build classrooms, buy books, equip computer labs, pay for health exams, supply water and buy sewing machines to empower other young women to start their own businesses.

IIM-hmedabad hikes fee by hefty 11% across programmes'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
Management education at the country’s top notch B-schools, the IIMs, is set to burn a bigger hole in the pocket with the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) taking the lead this time announcing a hefty 11% fee hike after a hiatus of two years. The IIM-A on Tuesday announced a hike in fees across all its programmes, raising the fee of its flagship programmes — PGP and PGP-FABM (Food and Agri Business Management) — from R16.6 lakh to R18.5 lakh. The fee of the PGPX course has also been increased to R24 lakh from R21.5 lakh for the batch starting April 2015.
Attributing the hike in the fees to inflation as well as rising administrative costs, Professor Ashish Nanda, director, IIMA, said, “There has been a steady rise in the expenses and when students who pass out of this institute go on to become leaders of corporates, it is only fair that they invest in their education. This should not be passed on to the taxpayers. However, even as the institute raises its fees, we emphasise our commitment to providing generous financial aid and working intensively with financial institutions to make educational loans easily available, so as to ensure that capable students continue to be able to join IIM-A, irrespective of their financial means,” said Nanda while addressing the media on Tuesday.
“For the PGP and PGP-FABM programmes, the tuition fee increase is 10%, whereas administrative costs (for hostel, facilities, academic support, etc) have increased at a higher pace owing to inflation. The cumulative fee increase for all three programmes of about 11.5% equates to about 3.7% annual increase over the three years. Even as IIM-A has been under increasing cost pressure, it has been committed to providing education to all capable students. IIM-A disbursed financial aid of R7.55 crore to 295 students in 2012-13 and R6.94 crore to 242 students in 2013-14, which, to our understanding, represents a significantly broader and deeper commitment than do the financial aid programmes of comparable institutions. IIM-A has also worked intensively with FIs and currently several banks are offering students loans covering 100% of their educational cost,” added Nanda.
In another major initiative to expand its global footprint, the institute is also introducing supernumerary seats for foreign nationals. IIM-A will offer seats over its present capacity to foreign students for the PGP course. “Our objective is to get quality foreign students to bring in diversity, and also to position the institute as a global learning destination for management students,” said Professor Ajay Pandey, dean programmes, IIM-A.

Yen slips in wake of Japan s decision to delay sales tax rise0
Sterling and the New Zealand and Australian dollars had been the main losers among major currencies early in Europe, both the Aussie and the kiwi hurt by trade numbers from China showing a sharp drop in imports and another 2 percent slide in oil prices.
Sterling and the Aussie recovered most of those losses, but the kiwi traded almost 0.9 percent lower by 0630 ET while Norway's crown - exceptionally sensitive to oil prices - dropped around half a percent against both the euro and dollar.
"With the kiwi, its more the move higher in U.S. yields than anything," said Hardman. "It's really a big story of dollar strength."
The Swiss franc, another very low yielding currency, fell to an 18-month low of 0.9818 francs per dollar.
TARGETED
Among big events for markets this week are the European Central Bank's second offer of targeted loans (TLTRO) to banks and speeches by a handful of U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of next week's final policy meeting of the year.
"The jobs numbers supported the dollar and we expect this trend to continue ahead of the Fed meeting as interest rate expectations continue to adjust," said Josh O'Byrne, a strategist with Citi in London.
Overall, the dollar was up another 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies. Dealers said the yen was supported by around $2 billion worth of options expiries at 121.50 yen per dollar, putting a cap on the dollar's strength.
Most major banks continue to predict further gains for the dollar against its major peers in 2015, although the surge past 120 yen has left some wondering how much juice there still is in the yen trade, at least for now.
There is also Japan's national election next Sunday, currently seen as likely to give a boost to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and reflationary policies which weaken the yen.
The euro fell to a low of $1.2247 after Nowotny's comments.
"We expect the euro to continue to weaken in the week ahead," analysts from French bank BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. "Another low TLTRO uptake could put some upside pressure on euro front-end rates. However, low demand would also increase the chances of an increase in asset purchases (by the ECB) early next year."

India Inc top guns fail to cheer markets: All you need to knowBSE Sensex eases further on selling in IT sector
India’s top firms have reported weak bottomline growth for the quarter ended September 2014.
Net profits of the BSE-30 Index (Sensex) firms grew 6% year-on-year in the September quarter, well below expectations of 10.1% growth, says a study by the Kotak group. These companies had showed 19.3% growth in the first quarter ended June.
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased by just 1.8% as against the estimate of 5.8%.
Underlying trends in banks (high bad loans and slippages) and consumer staples (low volume growth) remained weak but order inflows picked up, suggesting potential economic recovery in the next 2-4 quarters.
Credit growth of the banking sector dipped to 9.7% in September
Muted growth in net profits in the September quarter will temper the Street’s expectations of accelerated earnings.
WHAT IT MEANS:
1. Underlying parameters such as loan growth, credit quality for banks and volume growth for consumer and cement companies remained weak.
2. It is perhaps too early to expect a structural economic recovery although the government is implementing reforms for higher growth.
3. Order inflows of major industrial firms picked up, indicating a potential recovery in the investment cycle
4. Kotak expects weak GDP data for second half given continued weak investment demand and likely reduction in plan expenditure by the government in order to meet its gross fiscal deficit at  4.1% of GDP.

"Is Workplace Discipline in India a Myth"Story
Is workplace discipline in India a myth?
B-School students Shrikala Kashyap and Vineeth Subramanian debate whether India can ever see workplace discipline or it is just a myth.
Shrikala Kashyap PGP (class 2015), ISB, Hyderabad
Agree
"Workplace discipline in India is lower compared to other countries"
Shrikala Kashyap PGP (class 2015), ISB, Hyderabad
In our country, time is not respected and time management is something that we all struggle with. So much so, that the famous 'Indian Standard Time' has taken an almost hilarious connotation. Many organisations are yet to follow an automated timekeeping or attendance system to monitor employees. Lack of such systems encourage workers to bend the rules, resulting in low productivity.
Workplace indiscipline has a trickle-down effect that affects a company's bottom line. Very often, employees are unaware of the consequences of their actions and hence we witness several cases of wrong behaviour at the workplace. This is because action taken is rarely prompt, resulting in a long drawn and complicated process, which encourages deviation from rules.
People who have worked the world over often state a dip in professionalism and discipline in India when compared to other countries. Why is this happening? It isn't just the lax processes or irresponsible time management, but a lot of it stems down to the basics for developing work discipline. In a country where people spend close to 12 hours at work, respecting policies assumes paramount importance. I can state various other examples; it does not stop just at workplace and extends to the mindset as well. This dialogue is particularly important as we see more women enter the workforce. Work discipline should foster a culture of integrity, learning and ultimately, excellence.

"Indians are more comfortable with unequal power distribution"
Vineeth SubramanianPGP (class 2013-15), IIM Trichy
If your office has a strict "no smoking within premises" policy, would you smoke in your cubicle? Would you calmly take an afternoon nap at work? Whenever your manager allocates you tasks that you don't necessarily like, do you slap your manager to communicate your feelings? If your answer is "No" to all three, then you are only demonstrating typical workplace discipline.
In order to draw some broad conclusions about workplace discipline in India, particularly in comparison to the west, I would use Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions study about the behaviour of people across cultures. Drawn from Hofstede's study of IBM employees of different nationalities, the study reveals, among other things, that Indians endorse high 'power distance' in their workplace as compared to the world average. Power distance is the extent to which less powerful members of an organisation accept unequal distribution of power. In other words, as per the widely accepted study, Indians are more comfortable with unequal power distribution.
It is no wonder that Indians display high workplace discipline. It's the acceptance of power gap and the subsequent tendency to stay within organisational guidelines, which manifest in the form of workplace discipline. So what would be the secret to ensure good workplace discipline? Simple, just make jobs "worth the discipline" for the employees.

Iran nuclear talks get down tonitty-grittyJohn Kerry though, who held the latest in a string of meetings with Zarif in Oman last week, put the onus on Iran.
By: Agence-France Presse | Vienna | Posted: November 19, 2014 12:14 pm
Iran and six world powers get down to business in Vienna today, groping for the elusive magic formula to secure a milestone nuclear deal that satisfies hardliners in Tehran and Washington.
The clock will be ticking though on the second day of a final round of talks, with the deadline for Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany on Monday.
“This is a very critical week obviously in Iran negotiations,” US Secretary of State John Kerry, expected in the Austrian capital later in the week, said in London yesterday.
“We hope we get there but we can’t make any predictions.”
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, arriving in Vienna yesterday, said that a deal was “possible” and that if the talks fail it will be because the six powers wanted too much.
“If, because of excessive demands… we don’t get a result, then the world will understand that the Islamic Republic sought a solution, a compromise and a constructive agreement and that it will not renounce its rights and the greatness of the nation,” Zarif told Iranian media.
Kerry though, who held the latest in a string of meetings with Zarif in Oman last week, put the onus on Iran.
“It is imperative that Iran works with us with all possible effort to prove to the world that the programme is peaceful,” Kerry said.
British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond echoed his comments, calling for more “flexibility by the Iranians to convince us that their intentions in their nuclear programme are entirely peaceful”.
The landmark accord being sought by Monday’s deadline, after months of negotiations, is aimed at easing fears that Tehran might develop nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian activities.
It could resolve a 12-year standoff, silence talk of war, help normalise Iran’s relations with the West, boost the beleaguered Iranian economy and mark a rare foreign success for US President Barack Obama.
In order to make it virtually impossible for Iran to assemble a nuclear weapon, the US, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany (the P5+1) want Iran to scale down its nuclear programme.
Iran, which insists its nuclear aims are exclusively peaceful despite failing to declare parts of its programme in the past, wants painful sanctions lifted.
Some areas appear provisionally settled. But the big problem remains enrichment, rendering uranium suitable for power generation and other peaceful uses — but also, at high purities, for a weapon.

Kerala: 15-year-old killed by classmates over loveaffairPrint
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: November 20, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 20, 2014 2:13 am
A Class X student in Kerala’s northern Kasargod district was murdered by classmates following a dispute over an affair with a girl in their class, local police claimed.
S Abhilash, a 15-year-old student of the government higher secondary school in Hosdurg, was found dead in a pond within the campus of a polytechnic institute in the city on last Saturday. Abhilash went missing while returning home after classes on Friday.
Police said he was accompanied by two classmates and later had an altercation with them over a girl in their class. Abhilash was stabbed in his with a compass. As blood oozed out from his eyes, Abhilash was goaded to wash his eyes by the other two. They went to the pond situated in the campus of the polytechnic institute.  However, the altercation continued near the pond and the two students drowned Abhilash to death. Later, they left for their homes.
The family of Abhilash had started a search for their son on Friday night itself. They also filed a missing complaint with the local police. During a search, his body was found in the pond with suspiscious bruise marks on his face and a blood clot in the eye.
On Tuesday, police grilled the two students who were found to be with him after Friday’s school hours. They had earlier told the police that Abhilash accidentally fell into the water while bathing in the pond. However, later, they confessed to the murder.
On Wednesday, police recorded the arrest of the two students, both Class X students.

Police on Wednesday said cases were registered on Tuesday night against Rampal, ashram spokesman Raj Kapoor, another key functionary Purshottam Dass and several other followers under under various Sections of the IPC.
The case has been filed under Sections 121 (waging, or attempting to wage war, or abetting waging of war, against the Government of India), 121A (conspiring to commit certain offences against the state) and 122 (Collecting arms etc. with the intention of waging war against the Govt of India).
Besides, the cases have also been slapped against the accused under Sections 123 (concealing with intent to facilitate design to wage war) and other charges that include attempt to murder, assault and under various Sections of the Arms Act, police said.
The fresh cases were filed after clashes broke out at the ashram between police and Rampal’s supporters, who allegedly resorted to firing and threw petrol bombs.
Rampal is already an accused in a murder case.
Earlier this week, Punjab and Haryana High Court gave the government time till Friday to produce Rampal in contempt of court case, after which authorities have been asking the devotees in and around the Satlok Ashram to disperse and help them comply with court order.

Delhi HC to hear petitions seeking stay on Imam Bukhari naming son asdeputyThe Imam of India’s largest mosque had recently roused controversy by announcing that his 19-year-old son would be appointed the deputy imam.
, Reported by Aneesha Mathur | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 12:20 pm
 
The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said it will hear the three petitions seeking a stay on the dastarbandi ceremony (anointment) for the son of Jama Masjid’s “Shahi Imam” Ahmed Bukhari as the “deputy” or naib Imam in detail tomorrow.
The Imam of India’s largest mosque had recently roused controversy by announcing that his 19-year-old son would be appointed the deputy imam and had later said that the dastarbandi was a “private religious ceremony”.
“It’s disturbing how we treat our history. It’s an admitted position that it’s a Waqf property,” additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared on behalf of the Archeological Survey of India, said.
Alleging that the post of an imam cannot be hereditary under Islam or under Indian law, the pleas state that Imam Bukhari is an “appointee” of the Waqf Board and cannot be allowed to appoint his own successor.

Harry Styles  Taylor Swift getting backtogetherHarry Styles dated taylor Swift from October 2012 to January 2013. (Source: AP)

One Direction star Harry Styles and country star Taylor Swift are rumoured to be thinking about giving their relationship another shot, after spending almost two years apart.
Styles, 20, who recently made comments hinting he may be bisexual, is said to have been bombarding the 24-year-old beauty with text messages in a bid to get her back, reported Hollywood Life. “Harry has been plaguing Taylor with texts and sent her 1,989 roses to celebrate the release of her new album ‘1989’,” a source said.
Styles dated the ‘Shake It Off’ hitmaker from October 2012 to January 2013 and their brief romance is thought to have ended on bad terms after Swift appeared to poke fun at Harry later that year.
Swift, who has remained single, seems to have forgiven Styles, who has been linked to a number of famous faces including Kendall Jenner since their break up, and has been “talking about how much he’s matured.”

Markets offer plenty affordable smartphone optionsStory
The problem of plenty
In the affordable smartphone segment, options galore and deciding on which one to buy is getting tougher.

These days smartphones come in various shapes, hues and prices. It has created its own problem. As the market gets flooded with options, deciding which one to buy is getting tougher. The recently launched Intex Cloud FX-based on Mozilla Firefox OS is one of them that costs Rs 1,999. There are also a plethora of wallet-friendly devices that run on Google Android OS. They start from as low as  Rs 1,999, which is what it costs for the recently launched Jive JSP 20 that runs on an outdated version of Android OS. But it definitely is well-built and has good looks.
But if you are looking for a smartphone with Kitkat, the latest Android OS, the prices will go up by a notch. Smartphones with this OS, a responsive 3.5 or 4-inch display, 5 MP camera, a dual core processor and 512 MB RAM costs upwards of Rs 2,500. One of them is Intex Aqua T2. It comes with a 3.5-inch screen, 1.3 GHz dual core processor, 512 MB internal storage and an expandable memory card slot. These are not the best in terms of specifications but at Rs 2,690 it does appear worthy.
The smartphone market seems to be facing a glut because for every extra Rs 100 that one decides to spend, there is yet another device to be considered. The Karbonn Smart A12 costs Rs 4,099. It has a 4-inch IPS display, 1.2 GHz dual core processor, 512 MB RAM, 4 GB ROM and a 5 MP rear camera. The Lava Iris 404 Flair has a 3.5-inch screen, 512 MB RAM, 1.3 GHz dual core processor, 4 GB of internal storage and 5 MP rear camera for just  Rs 4,649.
While all these smartphones are cheap due to competition, Google got into this segment with Android One with only one purpose: build high-quality handsets for a price as low as $100. The Android One smartphone has a good look and feel and performs well too. For Rs 6,000-plus, you get 4.5-inch display, a quad-core processor, 1GB RAM and a good battery.
We already have three Android One smartphones in the market - the Micromax Canvas A1, Karbonn Sparkle V and Spice Dream UNO. Google seems to have a strict quality control. In the box packaging, the placement of battery, headphone and charger are exactly the same. All three devices have a 4.5-inch display with a front-facing camera minus any branding. The company logo is at the back along with the prominent Android One branding. Remove the back panel and the two SIM slots, memory card slot and the battery placement too are identical. The innards too are alike.
While these smartphones offer a similar experience, Micromax Canvas A1 appears to have a better built quality. Hide the brand name and one would easily take it for a Samsung or a Motorola.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee met President Pranab Mukherjee Tuesday evening to invite him for an industry meet in the state in January. She earlier invited Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for the event when she visited him on Monday evening.
“I have invited Arunji because he is the Finance Minister of the country. I am meeting the President to invite him for BengalLeads. Investors from across the world will come to the event,” Banerjee said. She also met home minister Rajnath Singh in what Trinamool sources described as a “courtesy visit”.
She, however, gave the international conference on Jawaharlal Nehru organised by the Congress a miss. Tuesday was the second and the last day of the conference. During an informal interaction with journalists, Banerjee made light of the Swachh Bharat Mission and the Adarsh Gram scheme under which MPs are adopting villages as a “rehash of old schemes”.

Rupee falls for fifth day on icreased US dollar demandFOREX UPDATE: Rupee falls to over 8.5-mth low on dollar demand

The Indian rupee extended its losses for the fifth session in a row and ended at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96 against the Greenback on Wednesday following sustained dollar demand from oil importers and weakness in local stock market.
Slowdown in inflows also weighed on rupee that ended 22 paise lower while the dollar index was trading almost stable against its six major global rivals ahead of the release of the minutes of a key US Federal Reserve meeting.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the local currency commenced lower at 61.80 a dollar from previous close of 61.74 and immediately touched a high of 61.7850.
However, dollar demand pulled down the rupee as it fell back sharply to a low of 61.9950. It settled at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96, logging a drop of 22 paise or 0.36 per cent. This was its weakest closing since finishing at 62.04 on March 3, 2014. It had also logged intra-day low of 62.15 on March 4, 2014. Crude oil prices had fallen in the initial half of the day and prompted oil companies to speed up their greenback purchases also hurt sentiments.
Furthermore, a fall in local stocks triggered concerns of foreign fund outflows that also weighed on rupee, said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India. The rupee has weakened by 45 paise in five straight days.
In the stock market, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex tumbled by 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, after touching intra-day all-time peak of 28,294.01. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $2.44 million on Tuesday, as per Sebi data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group, said: Trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40.

Not just Hindalco  SPP red-flagged other coal cases to CBI chief Ranjit Sinha'Industry specific amendments needed to milk Make in India'
Last week, the Supreme Court-appointed Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) in the coal scam cases, senior advocate Rajinder Singh Cheema, challenged the CBI’s line on the ongoing probe related to the allocation of Talabira II coal blocks in Orissa to Hindalco, owned by the Kumar Mangalam Birla group. He said that \there was “prima facie” material against “private parties” and “some government officials” to take cognisance of offences.
Hindalco isn’t the only case where Cheema questioned the agency.
Sources have confirmed to The Indian Express that since he took over as SPP in August, Cheema has written at least six strongly worded letters to CBI director Ranjit Sinha. Most of these pertain to what he calls “sketchy” closure reports filed by the agency in the coal block cases; others urged Sinha to be “more transparent” with the court. After his letters, at least three closure reports have been reviewed. These deal with cases related to JAS Infrastructure and Power Ltd; Hindalco and Navbharat Power Private Ltd.
Cheema is also learnt to have questioned the CBI’s decision to not arraign some persons without offering any cogent reason.
“In his letters, he (Cheema) has pointed to the fact that in many cases the closure reports filed by us are sketchy, only contain a gist of the FIR and end with a laconic conclusion that the allegations have not been substantiated.
He has told the Director that unless and until the entire relevant data is made available to the court, the agency could be faulted for not being transparent. In such an eventuality, the court may delve deep into case diaries and crime files, something that is permissible but is not ordinarily required,” a senior CBI functionary told The Indian Express.
In one such letters, Cheema has highlighted what he calls guidelines the CBI should follow in closure reports: give detailed information about allegation and evidence — oral as well as documentary — which could substantiate the allegation; evidence which renders the case unfit for prosecution; and, lastly, the reason for closure.
Cheema is learnt to have told the CBI chief that in case the court refuses to accept the CBI’s closure report, it would become practically impossible to effectively prosecute the accused in the absence of relevant material.
Incidentally, following the strong stand taken by Cheema in some cases where the probe agency sought closure, the CBI special judge refused to accept the agency’s closure reports.
In one such case — CBI versus Vikash Metal and Power Ltd — special judge Bharat Parashar came down heavily on the CBI. “I am rather constrained to observe that investigation in the present matter has been carried out in a clandestine manner and the final report of the CBI rather appears to be the document purporting to be a plea of defence of the accused persons rather then the report of an investigation agency.”
When asked about Cheema’s letters with the agency, CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad said: “This is correspondence between a client and its counsel and so is privileged. Therefore, it won’t be appropriate to comment.”

OECD raises economic growth outlook to 6.6%OECD raises India growth outlook, urges reforms to return to 8 pc growth

India's economy will accelerate in 2015 but will fail to attain the heady growth rates of the past decade without sweeping structural reforms, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  ( OECD ) has said.
In a country survey, the Paris-based think tank forecast that India, which is Asia's third-largest economy would grow by 6.6 per cent in 2015, up from its last forecast of 5.7 per cent growth in May.
Growth would edge higher to 6.8 per cent in 2016, it said.
"The economy has shown signs of a turnaround and imbalances have lessened," the OECD said in the report which, while providing comfort to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that things are looking up, highlighted tough choices ahead.
Modi's election by a landslide earlier this year has lifted business confidence, while fiscal consolidation and easing pressures on inflation and the current account deficit all point in the right direction.
In its latest forecast, the OECD said it expected inflation to fall to 5.4 per cent in 2015 and nudge higher to 5.6 per cent the following year, after 6.9 per cent in 2014. In May, it forecast that inflation would remain above 6 per cent over the next few years.
Yet while current risks are broadly balanced, the medium- term outlook is less bright. Exports are constrained by supply-side bottlenecks, while high corporate borrowing and deteriorating asset quality at banks "may put the investment recovery at risk", the report added.
Huge barriers to growth, from infrastructure bottlenecks to restrictive labour laws to weak education, will hold India back if not addressed.
"Structural reforms would raise India's economic growth. In their absence, however, growth will remain below the 8 per cent achieved during the previous decade," the OECD said in the 158-page report.
In its key recommendations the OECD said India should:
- Improve the macroeconomic framework by introducing flexible inflation targeting, pursuing fiscal consolidation, implementing a national value-added tax and strengthening banking oversight.
- Boost manufacturing jobs by simplifying labour laws, improving access to education, accelerating approvals for infrastructure projects and improving the business climate.
- Increasing female economic participation by ensuring equal work opportunities for women and expanding access to education and skills training for female entrepreneurs.
- Improving access to, and the quality of, healthcare.
The OECD tracks its 34 advanced economy members, in addition to issuing forecasts and surveys of large non-member countries like India.

Kerala HC directs vigilance bureau to expedite probe against Mani in liquor licencecasePrint
By: Express News Service | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: November 19, 2014 12:40 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 12:47 pm
The Kerala High Court on Wednesday directed the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) to expedite the probe into the complaint that Finance Minister K M Mani accepted bribe to renew liquor licence of hotels.
In the progress report submitted in the court, VACB said it had not so far obtained any evidence to substantiate money transactions in the alleged corruption case. The VACB told the court that the statements of 13 witnesses have to be recorded. The statements of 19 witnesses had been reported, but none of them had told the investigating agency that Mani had taken bribe.
The VACB submitted the report in the court in a petition filed by CPI legislator V S Sunil Kumar that the agency should be directed to expedite the investigation in a week.
Advocate-General K P Dandapani told the court that the bar hotel association working president Biju Ramesh, who raised the allegation against the minister, had gone back from his earlier stand. Many key witnesses in the complaint had not so far deposed before the VACB.

Under the leadership of its new Indian-American CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has overtaken oil giant Exxon Mobil to become the world's second most valuable company after iPhone maker Apple.
Nadella restructured Microsoft that has been struggling with the declining market in personal computers to focus on cloud services and mobile technology while cutting jobs and company expenses, Tech Times reported.
The effort has resulted in stock surges with Microsoft now the second most valuable company in the world, it said.
Exxon's stock currently has a market capitalization of $402.66 billion, down from $483.1 billion earlier this year.

In May, the total market value of Microsoft was $343.8 billion but it shares closed at $49.58 on November 14, giving it a corresponding market value of $408.7 billion, exceeding that of Exxon's which has fallen by more than 6 percent because of plummeting oil prices.
Although Microsoft has obviously done better compared with other tech stalwarts Oracle, IBM and Hewlett-Packard , it continues to face the challenges of Apple's dominance, Tech Times said.
In the mobile industry, people refer to the company's Surface tablets as "iPads" and even "knockoff iPads," it noted.
Forbes latest list of the world's most valuable brand is dominated by tech giants with tech companies Apple, Microsoft and Google getting the top three spots followed by Coca-Cola and IBM ranking fourth and fifth respectively, Tech Times noted.

Secure exit of about 15,000 followers from Satlok Ashram and arrest 450 people, including two of Rampal's close aides.
The Haryana Police on Wednesday closed in on self-styled godman Rampal after it secured the exit of about 15,000 of his followers from the Satlok Ashram in Barwala, Hisar. The police have also arrested 450 people, including two of his close aides and about 350 of the ashram `commandoes’, for violence against the State.
However, the violence has also taken its toll. While the bodies of four women were handed over the police by the ashram authorities, another woman and an infant died due to medical reasons.
The police which had suspended the operation last evening to allow people to come out of the Ashram, waited patiently for a large part of the day for the followers of Rampal to emerge from the Ashram. By evening about 2,000 people were still present in the ashram.
Simultaneously efforts were also being made to secure the surrender of Rampal and his core team of supporters even as the police with the help of Central Reserve Police Force prepared for a final round of assault, which many fear could be a bloody one as many of the godman’s followers are armed with guns, revolvers and pistols.
Earlier in the day, Director General of Police S.N. Vashisht had said the operation to bring the fugitive godman to book would continue till he is arrested and produced before the High Court, which had issued non bailable warrants against him.
Mr. Vashisht said it was around 10 last night that the first batch of followers of the godman began coming out of the Ashram. About 2,000 men came out in the first round and expressed their desire to go home. They were taken to railway stations and bus stands in Hisar and Jind by Haryana Police and Haryana Roadways buses. Subsequently through the night about 8,000 more people, including women, children and elderly who were being captive in the ashram for over a week, came out.
Most of the followers were from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and had come to Barwala for a four-day satsang which had started on November 6. The DGP said he was in touch with Delhi Police and Uttar Pradesh officials to ensure that there was no regrouping of Rampal’s followers.
The police made those coming out walk in a single file and through a group of spotters as it wanted to screen these people for the presence of some of Rampal’s followers engaged in Tuesday’s violence. So far about 270 people have been detained, 20 of them for actively participating in the violence. By late in the day the police had also arrested the spokesperson for the Satlok Ashram Raj Kapoor, Rampal’s close associate Purshottam Das and about 350 “commandoes” or private security personnel of the Ashram.
Stating that the Haryana police was committed to saving the lives of the innocent people, Mr. Vashisht said he was hopeful that the remaining 5,000 people in the ashram would also come out by this evening. Those involved in the violence have been booked for sedition, criminal conspiracy, illegal detention and rioting among other charges.
Mr. Vashisht said the operation was suspended last evening to enable the innocent women and children to come out and he was glad that the strategy worked as they did not want any casualties among this section. “The interviews of these people to the media in Hisar show that they were being kept in the ashram by Rampal’s men against their wishes.”
A large number of people coming out of the ashram said they had been locked up and detained by the “sewadars” or volunteers in the ashram. Many had also got separated from their family members during the stay in the ashram or while coming out of it.
The DGP said the culprits, who precipitated the crisis, would have to face the full force of law.
He also mentioned how six of the ashram inmates had died. “We were handed over bodies of four women by the Ashram authorities this morning and they have been sent for post-mortem.” Their post-mortem later confirmed that none of them had sustained external injuries.
These women have been identified as Savita, 31, of Delhi; Santosh, 45, of Rohtak in Haryana; Malkeet Kaur, 50, of Sangrur in Punjab; and Rajbala of Bijnore.
Mr. Vashisht asserted that there has been no firing by the police so far and the police has also not entered the Ashram premises. He said depending on the investigation, cases would be registered into these deaths.
This apart, the DGP said, at about 4 a.m. a woman inmate of the ashram, Rajni of Lalitpur in Uttar Pradesh was sent to a medical college at Agroha with a heart valve problem and later died there. Similarly, he said, a one-and-a-half year old child, Dhairya, of Rewa district of Madhya Pradesh, who had a condition of congenital jaundice, also died in the ashram.
Mr. Vashisht claimed that these two death appeared to be natural.
He said the operation at the 12-acre ashram would continue till Rampal’s arrest, who has now also been booked for sedition. He declared that no talks were possible with such a fugitive now and the only option available to Rampal was to surrender.
The DGP said the ashram inmates had not only used .315 bore guns and firearms but also acid bulbs and petrol bombs against the police. Besides, he said, the nearly 200 gas cylinders found stored in the ashram also posed a threat as firebombs were thrown at them to set them alight.
In another development, the Haryana Government said the general public of Barwala town and nearby villages tried to move towards the Ashram to express its resentment against Rampal and his activities. But the heavy deployment of force prevented a face-off. It said the Union Home Ministry has also provided two additional companies of CRPF to tackle the situation.

High realty prices push down demand  home loan growthPrint

At a time when most asset classes, including equities and debt, are on an upswing, the slump in residential demand on account of high real estate prices is now evident in the demand for housing loans from banks.
A look at the monthly data released by the Reserve Bank of India shows that in the six-month period between April and September 2014, the sector witnessed a dip in the value of home loans disbursed (in absolute numbers) by banks as compared to the corresponding period last year.
The housing loan outstanding in the period between April and September 2013 rose by Rs 45,600 crore — from Rs 4,60,000 crore in March 2013 to Rs 5,05,600 crore in September 2013. However, in the period between April and September 2014, it rose by Rs 39,600 crore — from Rs 5,40,800 crore in March 2014 to Rs 5,80,400 crore in September 2014. Compared to the previous year, that is a drop of Rs 6,000 crore in disbursement numbers.
The sector has also seen a constant decline in growth rate, in line with the overall credit growth over the last one year.
The RBI data shows that the home loan outstanding, which grew at the rate of 20 per cent (year-on-year) in the month of September 2013, has softened over the last 12 months and was down to 14.8 per cent in September 2014.
The slowdown has also resulted in a rise in unsold inventory across major markets, which have witnessed a drop in residential real estate prices. The Residex index prepared by National Housing Bank shows that residential housing prices in major cities such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chandigarh and Jaipur have remained under pressure — either softening or staying flat — in the first six months of 2014.
The inventory levels too have been on the rise. A report released by Knight Frank shows that the unsold inventory for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and NCR at the end of June 2014 stood at 2,13,742 units and 1,67,000 units, respectively.
Industry experts feel that the dip in growth rates in housing loan disbursements is on account of the slowing demand in the premium segment (houses priced over Rs 75 lakh), but housing finance companies (HFCs) see it as a reflection of the public sector banks (PSBs) losing out on the mortgage business in the housing segment.
“While the overall mortgage growth for HFCs is at 21-22 per cent, that of private banks is between 20 per cent and 25 per cent. It is slowest for PSBs, where the growth rate is around 10 per cent,” said Gagan Banga, vice chairman and MD, Indiabulls Housing Finance. “HFCs and private banks source their customers at the builder’s site and few customers go to PSBs. The slowdown in growth for PSBs is getting reflected in the RBI data.”
He added that while HFCs had a market share of around 27 per cent in 2008 in the home loan segment, it rose to 37 per cent by 2013. The biggest losers, he said, have continued…

India is changing the way it works: PM to business leadersPrint

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday pitched India to business leaders of Queensland as a different place with no uncertain and unpredictable pathways or hurdles.
At a business breakfast hosted by Queensland Premier Campbell Newman, Modi commended his efforts to make it possible for an investment of AUD 16 billion in coal mining. The Adani Group and the GVK Group both have plans to invest almost AUD 8 billion each in coal mining, rail and port projects. “It will set a new standard for India-Australia cooperation and demonstrate how Australia and Queensland can be a vital partner in meeting India`s requirement for energy and other vital resources,” he said.
India today is Queensland’s fourth largest export destination, and is also emerging as a major investment destination. “Queensland can be an important partner in India`s development – in energy, mineral resources, agriculture and food security, education and advanced technology in some areas,” the Prime Minister said.
Modi said his government has launched a major set of reforms to boost economic growth and improve the quality of life of people. Higher FDI in railways, defence and insurance, was one of them, he said. Besides, the government has gone had and introduced legislative changes to labour laws to make them more flexible. “On the policy side, We have made big changes in our policies on fuel – coal, natural gas, diesel,” he added.
He elaborated the changes initiated in the areas of policy, institutions and processes. Besides, Modi spoke about the new initiatives such as Make in India, smart cities and clean Ganga taken by him. As far as processes are concerned, the Prime Minister said India was changing the very way it works. “Good governance is the starting point of change. It is as important to business as it is to ordinary citizens,” he said.
The government was eliminating unnecessary laws and regulations, bringing more transparency and making processes easier and shorter. Also, there is a concerted effort and focus on ease of doing business. “We are partnering with state governments and even going doing to districts and villages,” he said.
“You will not only be able to convert opportunities into partnerships, you will do it in an environment that is welcoming and easy to do business in,” Modi said. After his address, he heard the views of business leader and their suggestions for a stronger relationship.

As earlier reported by IndianExpress.com , the new Google Nexus 6 smartphone made by Motorola is finally up for pre-orders on Flipkart starting today. The Nexus 6 32 GB is priced at Rs 43,999 while the the 64 GB version costs Rs 48,999.
Flipkart also has introduced an exchange offer with both versions of the Nexus 6 smartphone and is offering a maximum discount of Rs 10,000. Consumers can exchange their old Nexus 4 or Nexus 5 smartphone to get Rs 10,000 off.
Other offers include 3 month free subscription of Flipkart First, Rs 1500 Cash Back on purchasing on various monthly EMI’s via HDFC/ICICI bank and get pre-selected Flipkart eBooks worth Rs 2100 for free.
The Nexus 6 runs on a 2.7 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 805 processor with the Adreno 420 GPU and 3 GB RAM. Running the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop OS, the smartphone sports a 13 MP rear camera and has a 2 MP front camera. Powered by a 3220 mAh battery, the Nexus 6 comes with Bluetooth 4.1, WiFi, NFC and supports 4K video playback.
We got to play with the phone at Google’s annual Asia-Pacific press event at Taipei, Taiwan. At first glance, the Nexus 6 looks like a larger version of the new Moto X smartphone. It features a 6-inch quad HD display. Despite the 6-inch screen, the Nexus 6 doesn’t compromise much on one-handed operability. It never gives the user the feel that the device is big to hold.

The soldier as state actor

In conflict-ridden areas of India, governance has increasingly come to be seen through the lens of the counterinsurgency paradigm. These are abnormal conditions of governance
In the aftermath of the shooting of two young Kashmiri men by the Army on November 3, it is imperative to draw attention to the conditions of governance that control the everyday lives of millions of citizens. In several parts of India — the Northeastern States, Jammu and Kashmir and Chhattisgarh — the coercive arm of the state is also tasked with the creation of conditions under which civilian governance can proceed. This has not been perfectly achieved.
Since 2008, I have been researching India’s counterinsurgency campaigns in the Northeast, Jammu and Kashmir and the Maoist belt in Central India, particularly Chhattisgarh. In 2011, I spent a few months in Chhattisgarh. I recall here part of an interview with a Border Security Force (BSF) officer stationed in Bhilai, Durg district. The officer said, “We [the BSF] have been providing security for about one year. In this one year, there has been no development work. [The] State government has not undertaken one project. So now the BSF is doing civic action. We are providing resources. We have been distributing medicines, clothes, essentials, food, blankets, seeds for farming, utensils, sports items to children, school supplies. We have even given local panchayats and tribal leaders TV sets and DTH [direct to home] facilities. They need to have some information about the outside world … We have been providing security to the contractors, saying now get the work done. But no development has happened. We provide security, but no one carries out the job. This is the problem with our system. The Naxals are fighting this system. Their final target is the politician.”
Layering of roles
During a visit to Kashmir in September 2014, I found ‘Sadbhavna’ schools set up by the Indian military around the Line of Control (LoC) in villages like Dawar in Gurez sector, which are poor and lack much infrastructure. In an attempt to “win the hearts and minds” of people, by following U.S. counterinsurgency doctrine, the Indian Army had launched in the late 1990s “Operation Sadbhavna” (Goodwill) that is aimed at providing health services, undertaking women’s empowerment, operating schools under asbestos roofs, and, providing relief and rehabilitation.
What these accounts reveal is a layering of roles for the coercive state apparatus.
Schools and medicine aside, these are also the same state actors that possess the power to barge into local houses at will, arrest or kill people in fake encounters, impose curfews, order crackdowns and commit sexual offences against women with impunity. This is all done in the name of counterinsurgency. I argue here that in conflict-ridden areas of India, governance has increasingly come to be seen through the lens of the counterinsurgency paradigm. These are abnormal conditions of governance that I call garrison governance.
Garrison governance is governance conducted under the protection of the coercive arm of the state. The logic that underpins garrison governance rests on an assumption that without the presence of soldiers, normal state institutions will be severely crippled in their everyday functioning because of the threat of anti-state groups operating in the region.
Garrison governance is the enmeshment of the bureaucratic with the coercive. This leads to a governance outcome that privileges the everyday coercive over the bureaucratic avatar of the state. This code switching of roles that the Army and paramilitary play, also creates various levels of cognitive dissonance on the ground among locals. The uniformed state actor is not only creating the conditions for governance, but is also governing, while the regular bureaucrats are missing or incapable of governing. Local political representatives appear with their political party paraphernalia around election time and then disappear. The only constant state actor in such areas is the uniformed soldier from one of the various paramilitary forces, the Army or the police.
Uniformed actors
The Indian state has had to invest heavily in a security apparatus to facilitate incorporation and control of dissenting populations. But how did the Indian state reach this point? I argue here that a combination of factors has precipitated garrison governance. India had to become a counterinsurgent state along with becoming an independent democracy. Because the police forces were not adequate to address hostile rebel groups in the Northeast in the 1950s and 1960s and the local State’s bureaucratic apparatuses were underdeveloped at the time, the state relied heavily on the military and on special regiments like the Assam Rifles and Manipur Rifles, leading to an early institutionalisation of garrison governance. This over time became path-dependent, i.e., it was easier to allow garrison governance in the hands of uniformed actors to continue, than to actually try to find political solutions to persistent problems of insurgency. Political solutions only came with regard to Mizoram and, to a limited extent, in Tripura with the Tripura National Volunteers and in Bodoland. Several other ceasefires or “Suspension of Operations” agreements with insurgent groups in the northeast have only reduced levels of violence against the Army, but not between insurgent groups and have also not contained violence by the Army against unarmed locals.
However, Army, police and paramilitary officers that I have interviewed over the last seven years express much displeasure with the Central state. One officer in particular said that the Army was sent in to control populations and directives that came from the Home Ministry were almost never clear. So, he said, the Army “just does what it is trained to do”. A high-ranking official similarly suggested that in the end, all solutions would have to be political. The Army, he said, was only stabilising certain areas and helping in conducting elections.
Rights violations
The formula for garrison governance is rather simple — boots on the ground combined with some feel-good handouts. This obfuscates a larger architecture of oppression. Soldiers are still protected by the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in Manipur and Jammu and Kashmir, which has led to several reported incidents of human rights violations and sexual assault. The landscape is dotted with armed soldiers and the police; civilian movement is filtered and controlled in shopping districts and government offices, curfews and crackdowns are imposed at the slightest suggestion of dissent, and phone tapping is common. An Intelligence Bureau official stationed in Kashmir told me that they were tapping 10 lakh phones in Kashmir alone by 2014. In the last two decades, most Governors of Northeastern States have been former military generals.
Even the police in places like Kashmir have become more militarised. Assault rifles have replaced traditional lathis, which are now deemed insufficient for crowd control. Alongside this, Special Police Officers are being locally recruited, trained and deployed in Kashmir. Visitors to certain States are often visited by the special branch of the State police, which can, at will, investigate individuals and their intentions for being in the State. Security forces routinely stop inter-State buses and local buses for spot checks. Travelling in trains in the Northeast means being willing to open up your baggage to the officials of the Railway Protection Force.
During election time, troop deployment doubles across the Northeast. At a higher level, General Officers Commanding (GOCs) in these States have a high degree of power in maintaining counterinsurgency strategy. As reported by one bureaucrat deployed in Manipur in 2011, the GOC and the Chief Minister of Manipur often got into disagreements about what needed to be done about the hill tribes. Often the GOC won.
In spite of six decades of counterinsurgency, insurgencies in India have thrived. I have personally counted at least 196 insurgent groups since 1950 in India, many of which are still active. It is clear that a strategy meant to secure sovereignty has instead led to a permanent state of exception in some areas, where the character of governance itself is at odds with democratic norms since the power of elected representatives and bureaucrats is circumscribed by and enabled only at the behest of soldiers. Some constitutional rights of people stand suspended under such governance because non-insurgent, democratic political dissent has also come to be seen as a form of anti-state activity. Under such conditions, it is vital to reopen a debate into India’s counterinsurgency strategies in different areas and start thinking about political settlements to insurgencies.

Adani Enterprises won support on Monday from the State Bank of India (SBI) and an Australian state to help it build a $7 billion coal mine, defying a slump in coal prices to 5-1/2-year lows that has stalled rival projects.
The infrastructure conglomerate, whose founder, Gautam Adani, has close ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has signed a memorandum of understanding for a loan of up to $1 billion from the SBI for the mine, rail and port project, which it aims to build by end-2017.
The loan, which would be one of the largest extended by an Indian bank for an overseas project, was announced as Mr. Adani was in Brisbane with a business delegation for the G20 summit, which Mr. Modi attended over the weekend.
“The MoU with SBI is a significant milestone in the development of our Carmichael mine,” Mr. Adani said in a statement.
Mr. Adani, 52, has enjoyed a rapid rise in Indian business circles in recent years, a rise often associated with Mr. Modi, who until this year headed the government in Gujarat where Adani is based and where it has a huge coal-fired power plant.
Mr. Adani also won a commitment from the Queensland State government to take short-term, minority stakes in rail and port infrastructure needed to unlock the massive coal reserves in the untapped Galilee Basin.
Australia’s federal and Queensland governments are eager to see the mine built following the loss of more than 4,000 coal jobs over the past two years.

Putin: Speak politely  but carry guns  tooBy Karoun Demirjian November 18 Follow @karoun

MOSCOW — You could call it a Teddy Roosevelt moment: Russian President Vladimir Putin offered an extemporaneous adage Tuesday that sounded a whole lot like a twist on "big stick" diplomacy.
“You can do a lot more with weapons and politeness than just politeness,” Putin said, according to several Russian news outlets.
(Or maybe he’s just seen “The Untouchables” a few times too often, specifically the scene where Robert DeNiro’s Al Capone says, “You can get farther with a kind word and a gun than you can with just a kind word.”)
The Russian president’s remark was inspired while viewing a Moscow exhibition of armored personnel carriers and trucks billed as “polite armored vehicles.”
But as world leaders worry that relations with Russia are settling back into Cold War-like status, Putin’s words have potential resonance beyond the vehicles exhibition hall.
In recent weeks, Putin has sharpened his rhetoric against the West, particularly the United States. In a speech to the international experts and analysts of the Valdai Club late last month, Putin accused the United States of trying to impose a self-styled Cold War victors’ justice on the rest of the world – including Russia. On Tuesday, Putin accused the United States of trying “to subdue” Russia, and use Russia to “solve their problems at our expense.”
The recent shifts in Russia’s relationship with the West aren't limited to words. The two sides are currently locked in a sanctions-fueled face-off over Russia’s annexation in March of Crimea — carried out by troops that are often euphemistically referred to as " polite people " — and Russia's subsequent military involvement in eastern Ukraine. The United States has also accused Russia of violating its nuclear arms control treaty obligations in recent months.
Putin has repeatedly fired back, denying that Russia is involved in the Ukraine conflict and suggesting that if anyone is "destroying the current system of arms control agreements," it's the United States.
Russia, Putin has maintained, remains pragmatic and respectful of peace and dialogue when trying to achieve its interests.
But, as he noted Tuesday, guns can be useful, too.

Facebook launched a new free mobile app for its popular Groups feature that lets users create and interact with communities on the social networking website.
More than 700 million of Facebook’s 1.35 billion members use Groups, according to the company.
The new app is meant to make accessing Groups easier on a mobile device, allowing users to avoid having to dig through the Facebook app. It lets people manage their existing groups or discover new ones, either based on recommendations or by searching for different topics. Users can also create a shortcut on their phone’s screen for their favourite group if they want to access it quickly.
Facebook said, as with its messaging app, a stand-alone Groups function “helps people share faster and more easily with all the groups in their life.”
The company has been working to expand its presence on mobile devices by creating and buying apps such as Messenger, Paper, Instagram and WhatsApp.
Unlike with Messenger, though, the company said users will still be able to access Groups through the Facebook app or on the website.

Sensex surges to hit fresh record high in early tradeMarket update: Sensex slips from peak, Nifty closes below 8,400

The benchmark Sensex on Wednesday logged new lifetime high of 28,294.01 but retreated after a late fall gripped stocks to end 130 points down at 28,032.85, amid profit-taking in bluechips from metal, power and oil and gas space.
The BSE 30-share barometer, after hitting the new peak in the opening trade, succumbed to profit-booking and selling by foreign funds at record levels. At one point, it slipped below the 28,000-mark to touch the day's low of 27,963.51.
The gauge settled 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, lower at 28,032.85. On Tuesday, it had touched intra-day high of 28,282.85 but had ended with a loss of 14.59 points.
Major losers that pulled down Sensex and Nifty from record highs included Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite, GAIL, BHEL, Tata Motors, NTPC, Sun Pharma, ONGC , CIL , RIL and SBI.
Similarly, the NSE 50-scrip index Nifty after scaling a new peak of 8,455.65 at the outset, beating previous record of 8,454.50 touched on Tuesday, fell. It ended below the 8,400-mark to close with a loss of 43.60 points, or 0.52 per cent, at 8,382.30. Intra-day, it had touched a low of 8360.50.
Traders said besides profit-booking, a mixed trend in global markets ahead of the release of minutes of Federal Reserve policy meeting, led to the fall in Indian shares.
"Market remained in a very narrow range for most part of the trading session and corrected in the last 90 minutes of the trading session. Stocks that were top performing in the first half of the trading session, were the ones that corrected the most in the second half of the trading session," said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.
The local currency also appeared to be having a bad day with rupee trading near 62-levels against the US dollar.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors sold shares worth Rs 101.98 crore on Tuesday, first net sales in almost 3 weeks.
Sectorally, the BSE Metal index suffered the most by losing 2.14 per cent, followed by Power index which fell 1.80 per cent, Oil and Gas index by 1.35 per cent, Consumer Durables by 1.22 per cent and Realty index by 0.99 per cent.
Selling activity also gained momentum in small and mid-cap sector stocks. The BSE Small-cap index lost 0.65 per cent and Mid-cap index fell 0.63 per cent.
Bucking the trend, Dr Reddy, HUL, HDFC, Bajaj Auto, Airtel, L&T, Infosys and ICICI Bank ended up.
Jignesh Chaudhary, Head of Research, Veracity Broking Services said: "Indian equities opened positively, but as the day progressed, the indices lost their way. Indices are trading near all time highs so investors preferred to stay cautious at these levels."
Overall, 22 out of 30 Sensex-based scrips ended with losses while others settled with gains.
Major losers from the Sensex pack include Tata Steel (3.08 per cent), Sesa Sterlite (2.75 per cent), Gail India (2.30 per cent), Tata Motors (2.29 per cent), BHEL (1.99 per cent), NTPC (1.94 per cent) and Sun Pharma (1.77 per cent).
ONGC (1.69 per cent), Coal India (1.58 per cent), Cipla (1.47 per cent), M&M (1.43 per cent) and Reliance Industries (1.01 per cent) also were among laggards.
However, Dr Reddy's Lab rose by 2.45 per cent, HUL 1.19 per cent, HDFC 1.01 per cent, Bajaj Auto 1.01 per cent and Bharti Airtel 0.89 per cent.
Among the S&P BSE sectoral indices, metal fell by 2.14 per cent, followed by power 1.80 per cent, oil & gas 1.35 per cent, consumer durables 1.22 per cent, realty 0.99 per cent, bankex 0.65 per cent and auto 0.64 per cent.
Total market breadth turned negative as 1,840 stocks finished in red, 1,216 stocks closed in green while 95 ruled steady. Total turnover rose further to Rs 3,848.52 crore from Rs 3,657.51 crore on Tuesday.

Study will test survivors  blood to treat EbolaPhoto shows a mobile donation unit being loaded onto a plane at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in Raleigh, N.C. The unit was headed to Liberia for use in a study of blood plasma treatment for Ebola patients. (Source: AP)
Posted: November 19, 2014 9:52 am
A coalition of companies and aid groups announced plans Tuesday to test experimental drugs and collect blood plasma from Ebola survivors to treat new victims of the disease in West Africa.
Plasma from survivors contains antibodies, substances the immune system makes to fight the virus. Several Ebola patients have received survivor plasma and recovered, but doctors say there is no way to know whether it really helps without a study like the one they are about to start within a month.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is giving $5.7 million to scale up production of the treatments for the project in Guinea and other Ebola-affected countries in Africa.  More than a dozen companies, universities and others are contributing supplies, staff and cash, and are working with the countries and the World Health Organization on specific procedures and locations.
Besides helping Ebola patients now, plasma “could be a tool for a future epidemic as well” from different viruses, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.
“You might not have drugs and vaccines for some new thing” and it would be good to have capabilities in place to collect and give plasma to fill the gap until those other tools can be developed, he said.
There are no drugs or vaccines approved now for Ebola, which has killed more than 5,000 people this year in West Africa, most of them in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Doctors Without Borders last week also said it would host studies of experimental treatments and plasma at three of its West Africa treatment centers.
The drugs to be tested by both groups include brincidofovir, an antiviral medicine that has been tried in a few Ebola cases so far. Its maker, North Carolina-based Chimerix Inc., developed it to treat other types of viruses and lab tests suggest it might help fight Ebola.
“We said to them, ‘well, if money was no constraint, how much could you make?’ and they gave us a number,” Gates said. “So we said, ‘OK, we’ll take the risk that maybe nobody will ever buy this from you. So we’ll help you scale up the manufacturing.”’
Making plasma available is a complex task. Plasma is the clear part of blood, and the part that contains antibodies. In Africa, donors’ blood will be filtered through a machine to remove small amounts of plasma and return the rest of the blood to the donor _ a process that allows someone to donate as often as every two weeks.

Kiss of Love campaign likely to hit Bangalore after Kochi DelhiPrint
By: Express News Service | Bangalore | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:08 pm
After Kochi and Delhi the liberal Kiss of Love campaign – involving the public display of affection – which has raised the hackles of conservatives is scheduled to hit Bangalore over the next weekend with a human rights activist Rachita Taneja set to organize an event if granted clearances by the police and the Congress government in Karnataka.
With right wing leaders like Sri Rama Sene chief Pramod Muttalik already threatening to disrupt any event involving kissing in public the Karnataka government is approaching the issue with caution.
Home minister K J George said on Tuesday that the government would permit the event to be held if it falls within the purview of laws concerning public decency. A former woman Congress minister C Motamma however cautioned the government against allowing the event.
Bangalore police commissioner M N Reddi told The Indian Express on Tuesday that no one had approached the police as yet for permission for the conduct of the Kiss of Love event in Bangalore.
Last week Sri Rama Sene leader Pramod Muttalik had threatened action on Kiss of Love events if organized in Karnataka. He had stated that kissing in public is against Indian culture and that it should be a private affair.
The human rights activists Rachita Taneja is proposing holding the event on November 29 and has a scheduled meeting with police officials on Wednesday. The activist said that she would not like to hold the event if security and safety were to be compromised.

Comedian Tracy Morgan is still fighting to get better following his car crash in New Jersey in June.
The 46-year-old former ’30 Rock’ star, who suffered brain injuries, a broken femur, broken nose and broken ribs when a Walmart truck smashed into the limo bus in which he was travelling in with friends in New Jersey, is trying to get back to the person he once was, reported ABC News.
Speaking outside the federal courthouse in Trenton, New Jersey, his lawyer Benedict Morelli said, “Mr Morgan is a fighter. He’s fighting to get better.
“If there’s a chance to be back to the Tracy Morgan he once was, he is going to try to do that. We just don’t know.”
But Morelli admitted Morgan is still struggling. Asked if Morgan is doing much better, he replied, “He’s doing better. We are hoping and praying to get him back to the way he was. But the jury’s out.”
Morgan was extremely upset when Walmart recently accused him of being at least partially responsible for his injuries, as the company believes he wasn’t wearing a seatbelt when the crash took place.
He hit back at the retail giant on Twitter, writing: “My friends and I were doing nothing wrong.” Aside from his physical injuries, Morgan is also grieving the loss of his friend James ‘Jimmy Mack’ McNair, 62, who was killed in the crash.

The world’s boldest effort yet to hold North Korea and leader Kim Jong Un accountable for alleged crimes against humanity moved forward Tuesday at the United Nations, where a Pyongyang envoy threatened further nuclear tests.
The U.N. General Assembly’s human rights committee approved a resolution that urges the Security Council to refer the country’s harsh human rights situation to the International Criminal Court. The non-binding resolution now goes to the General Assembly for a vote in the coming weeks. China and Russia, which hold veto power on the council, voted against it.
The resolution was inspired by a groundbreaking U.N. commission of inquiry report early this year that declared North Korea’s human rights situation “exceeds all others in duration, intensity and horror.”
The U.N committee has adopted similar resolutions on the North’s abysmal human rights conditions in the past. But the fact that this year’s resolution includes the new idea that their absolute leader could be targeted by prosecutors has pushed the communist country to make a more furious response as that would pose a setback to its recent efforts to improve ties with the outside world to lure foreign investment and aid and revive the country’s troubled economy. North Korean officials would also view the resolution as a potential embarrassment to their young leader who took power after the death of his dictator father Kim Jong Il in late 2011.
North Korea sent a sharp warning in comments before the vote. Trying to punish it over human rights “is compelling us not to refrain any further from conducting nuclear tests,” said Choe Myong Nam, a foreign ministry adviser for U.N. and human rights issues. His colleagues gave no details on that threat.
Choe also accused the European Union and Japan, the resolution’s co-sponsors, of “subservience and sycophancy” to the United States, and he promised “unpredictable and serious consequences” if the resolution went forward.
The European Union quickly issued a statement welcoming the support of 111 countries in the vote. Nineteen countries voted against, and 55 abstained.
“It is admirable that the member states of the United Nations are acting to protect the people of North Korea when their own government fails to do so,” the head of the commission of inquiry, retired Australian judge Michael Kirby, said in an email, adding that he is confident the Security Council will “act responsibly.”
Human rights groups turned their attention to China and Russia, which could block any Security Council move. “No Security Council country, including China, can deny the horror endured by so many North Koreans,” Kenneth Roth, director of continued…

A large number of followers of ‘godman’ Rampal, who had been holed up in his ashram here for days, came out on Wednesday and narrated how they were virtually confined there along with “thousands” more who too were “desperately” wanting to leave the premises.
Hailing from various parts of the country, the followers claimed that “private commandos” of Rampal had been “forcing” them not to leave, but they managed to persuade and come out.
Haryana Director General of Police S N Vashisht told reporters that about 15,000 people were inside the ashram, out of which 10,000 have come out.
“We had come to the ashram for a ‘Satsang’ (religious gathering) a few days back. Later, we were asked to stay back and were not allowed to come out. The private commandos said that we will be safe inside and will be provided with food and taken care of.
However, we persisted that we needed to go out to get some medicines and somehow managed to come out this morning,” Birender, hailing from Gwalior, who came out of the ashram in a group that included his mother, told reporters.
He claimed that while a “few thousand” followers of the engineer-turned-godman had managed to come out of the Ashram since Tuesday, “still a huge number, which could run into thousands, are still inside.”
Earlier this week, Punjab and Haryana High Court gave the government time till Friday to produce Rampal in contempt of court case, after which authorities have been asking the devotees in and around the Satlok Ashram to disperse and help them comply with court order.
A middle-aged woman follower from Uttar Pradesh, who came out of the ashram today, said “Many women with babies as young as two year old were also inside” and ration supplies were running “very low“.
Hisar SP Satender Kumar Gupta said the police and civil administration was assisting the followers to reach destinations.
The district administration has pressed into service buses to transport the followers to the bus stand and the railway station for their onward journey.
On Wednesday, several Haryana Roadways buses could be seen parked along the roads close to the Ashram, to ferry the followers who wish to travel to the Hisar bus stand and the Railway station.
Meanwhile, several people from many villages of Barwala had volunteered to provide food and other items to the followers, security personnel and the media crews covering the event.

Telecom operator Reliance Jio Infocomm has arranged credit facilities worth $1.5 billion with lenders, including Bank of America and Barclays, to refinance existing loans.
Mukesh Ambani-led RJio would utilise the latest credit arrangements to re-finance debt tied up by it in 2010. The new loan facilities are guaranteed by its parent, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL).
In a statement on Monday, the company said that new credit facility "comprises $1 billion facility I, which has a total maturity of 5.5 years and the $0.5 billion facility II, which has a total maturity of 7 years."
This represents the longest average maturity for an unsecured syndicated loan of similar size in Asia this year, it added.
The facility was fully underwritten by an initial group of 15 core relationship banks that comprise the Mandated Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners (MLABs).
"The deal witnessed significant over subscription before it was launched into syndication and two banks joined in as MLAs. The overall bank group saw participation from banks all over the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia and the Middle East. This term loan syndication saw a total of 26 banks participate in the facility," the statement said.
Middle Eastern, regional Taiwanese and Japanese banks strongly participated in providing facility, the statement said.
"Facility saw tremendous response in Syndication and raised over $400 million. In compliance with RBI guidelines, this facility saw participation from only International banks," the statement added.
The 15 MLABs for the facility include Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Bank of America N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas, Singapore Branch, The Bank of Nova Scotia Asia Limited, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd and Citigroup Global Markets Singapore Pte. Ltd.
The 2 MLAs which came in before syndication are National Bank of Abu Dhabi P.J.S.C. and United Overseas Bank Limited.
The banks which joined in syndication include Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Societe Generale SA, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited, Singapore Branch, Land Bank of Taiwan, Singapore Branch and Mega International Commercial Bank Co., Ltd., Offshore Banking Branch.
Reliance Industries has already announced that it will launch commercial 4G telecom service of RJio in 2015 entailing investment of Rs 70,000 crore.

RJio is the only company which holds pan-India broadband wireless access spectrum that can be used for 4G services.

Shiv Sena slams Sharad Pawar over snap poll remarksBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 11:46 am
The Shiv Sena on Wednesday hit out at NCP Sharad Pawar after he asked his party to be ready for snap poll , saying he “is known for playing politics of distrust” and was trying to take advantage of the current instability.
Though NCP declared unconditional outside support to the minority BJP government the day Assembly poll threw up a hung verdict, party chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said that the state government’s stability was not NCP’s responsibility and asked party workers to be ready to face a snap poll.
“Sharad Pawar is taking advantage of this unstable government, but the Shiv Sena will stand firmly here. Let Pawar do whatever he wishes to. The Sena is fulfilling its role as an Opposition party honestly and with utmost sincerity,” an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said.
The Sena alleged that Pawar “is known for playing politics of distrust”, which is why he first gave support to the BJP and is now apparently threatening to withdraw it.
“Pawar thinks he can play politics as he wishes to and turn the political situation upside down. He wants to keep the future of the new government in his hands with 41 MLAs he has. Unstable government is the foundation of his politics. But the picture he has presented of the current political situation is laughable,” the Sena said.
Pawar’s words should not be taken seriously as he has a habit of saying something and doing something else, it said.
“He has the habit of creating an air of confusion and then gaining politically from it. This is his politics of survival,” the editorial said.
BJP has 121 MLAs in the Assembly having an effective strength of 287. With the backing of 41-member NCP, it had a comfortable majority. However, if NCP decides to withdraw support, it will be well short of the magic figure of 144 despite the backing of seven independents and some from smaller parties.

Bid to kidnap top pharma company official at gun-point  escapes attackPrint
By: Express News Service | Hyderabad | Posted: November 19, 2014 11:00 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 4:55 pm
Aurobindo Pharma vice-president Nityanand Reddy had a narrow escape when an assailant opened fire with an AK-47 rifle today morning at KBR park, a favourite place for morning walkers. Reddy came out of the park around 7:30 am and got into an Audi. He was putting on his seat belt when a man approached and forcibly got into rear seat, showed the gun and asked him to drive.
Police said the AK-47 belonged to the anti-Naxal Greyhounds force and was reported stolen last year from a camp in Gandipet near Hyderabad. When the assailant pulled out the gun from a bag, Reddy’s associate Prasad Reddy who was sitting in the front passenger seat turned around and tried to grab the gun. In the scuffle the gun went off, bullets hit the windshield and one grazed Nityanand Reddy.
Police Commissioner Mahender Reddy said eight rounds went off. “We think during the scuffle between the assailant and one occupant in the car, the gun went off accidentally. No one was seriously injured. Realising that things were out of his control the assailant dropped the car and got out. Prasad Reddy also got out and tried to grab him but he hit his hands and fled across the road and disappeared. The gun was reported stolen from a Greyhounds Police camp last year,” Mahender Reddy said.
KBR park, opposite the TDP Bhavan is a favourite place for high profile morning walkers. film stars, politicians including former CM Kiran Kumar Reddy go there daily.

IT major Infosys on Tuesday showed the door to Abraham Mathews, CFO of its BPO subsidiary, for not complying with the code of conduct, while CEO Gautam Thakkar has resigned taking responsibility on moral grounds.
The company also appointed Amit Uppadhayay as the CEO and Managing Director of the firm, replacing Thakkar.

Uppadhayay joined Infosys in 1993 and has held various senior management positions. He last served as the Senior Vice President and Global Head of Delivery for Financial Services, the filing said.

Suspected US strikes hit Syrian al-Qaida-heldtownPicture for representational purpose only (Source: AP)
Beirut (ap) | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:44 pm
Two activist groups say an airstrike believed to have been carried out by the US led coalition has targeted a town controlled by al-Qaida militants in northwestern Syria.
The Local Coordination Committees and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Tuesday that the strike hit the town of Harem in Syria’s Idlib province overnight. There was no immediate word on casualties.
It also was not immediately clear what was targeted, but Harem is controlled by al-Qaida’s Syrian branch, known as the Nusra Front. US aircraft bombed Nusra militants near Harem last week.
If the latest strike is confirmed, it would mark the fourth time that American aircraft have targeted the al-Qaida affiliate in the US led coalition’s broader aerial campaign against Islamic extremists in Syria and Iraq.

Making films my priority  not starring in them: DiaMirzaDia Mirza ties the knot with Sahil Sangha

Dia says there have been several acting offers but she has not taken up any project as she is yet to make her mind about
returning to movies. “There have been offers but nothing is decided right now. I am really enjoying being part of the filmmaking processn for now. I would definitely want to come in front of the camera and do a film. I enjoyed that phase of my career. May be next year I will be able to finally take a call on the film which I will star in,” Dia told PTI in an interview.
Dia Mirza’s last big screen outing was a Bengali film in 2012 and the actress, who has turned movie producer, says acting has taken a backseat as she is enjoying the process of filmmaking.
The 32-year-old actress co-owns Born Free Entertainment with her husband Sahil Sangha and they have produced films like ‘Love Breakups Zindagi’ and ‘Bobby Jasoos’.

The next ad frontier: Brain scans  eye sensors fromNielsenPrint
Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 2:09 pm
This may sound like science fiction, but it isn’t. Market research firm Nielsen India has announced the launch of its first neuroscience lab in the country to gauge consumer attention and brand engagement by measuring brainwaves.
The first lab will be set up in Mumbai followed by Delhi.
The lab will measure brainwaves and track eye movements to provide a real-time picture of consumers’ subconscious reactions to brand messages. It will use two techniques to capture the reactions — electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking sensors. The EEG method will use non-invasive caps that will measure brain activity while the eye-tracking sensors will study the movement of pupils.
While marketers will define the target group, Nielsen will conduct the research. The research involves individuals wearing special headgear held together by gels and wires and viewing videos or visuals in a closed room. The data captured in the headgear is then downloaded for analysis.
The research, according to Nielsen, will be useful across the marketing spectrum — from ads to aisles and from food to finance. Neuroscience can help in the areas of ad effectiveness, product design, in-store marketing, experiential marketing etc, said the market research company.
It already runs such labs in the UK, Germany, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Japan, the US and China.
Nielsen has already been providing neurological solutions in some measure to its clients in India and with the full-fledged lab plans to commence the exercise on a large scale. Joe Willke, president, Nielsen Neuro, said that neuroscience has penetrated fields such as economy, sociology and psychology. “Marketing communications is, in fact, the last bastion. If a television ad commercial is pre-tested and consumer reaction to it gauged before its final launch, it could help in optimising marketing spends by at least 5-10% and that’s a huge saving for companies alongside helping them tailor their communication for the intended purpose,” Willke said. “This kind of diagnosis is just not possible with traditional market research tools.”
“With these technologies, we can measure attention on a second-by-second basis,” Willke said, adding that big advertising and marketing spenders such as auto, financial services and telecom have already adopted neuroscience for market research.
Sanjay Tripathy, executive vice-president and head, marketing, product, digital & e-commerce, HDFC Life, said that as a marketer, he is excited about the possibilities offered by neuromarketing. Arguing that most purchase decisions are taken unconsciously and, hence, parameters such as behaviour, attention, cognition, emotion, perception, etc, are acquiring a new place in business-related matters and specifically in brand marketing, he said: “Consumer neuroscience, if executed with diligence, is the future of market research.”
Mediacom, a media agency owned by WPP, too, has a tool called Real World Street, which works on the same principle.
Even as the experiments in neuroscience marketing gain ground, marketers are treading the path cautiously. Santosh Desai, managing director and chief executive at Future Brands, said neuroscience is a bit ‘dodgy’. “There are ethical issues in this form of research since it bypasses the normal cognitive process and delves into the subconscious,” he said.

Rapper Nicki Minaj is planning to take a vacation from music to have a baby in the future. The 31-year-old singer, who is gearing up to release her third album, ‘The Pinkprint,’ next month, says she would be disappointed if she isn’t married with children by the time she releases her fifth album, reported Contactmusic.
“That I’ll become so consumed with work that I’ll forget to live my personal life to the fullest. If I’m done with my fifth album and I don’t have a child by then, no matter how much money I have, I would be disappointed, as a woman, because I feel like I was put here to be a mother,”  Minaj said.
The ‘Pills N Potions’ hitmaker, who split from long-term boyfriend Safaree Samuels earlier this year, admits she has put off getting married in the past.
“I have definitely put off the wife thing because I don’t want people in my business. I’d rather not do anything that’s going to be on paper but I definitely will be married before I have my baby.
“I want to make sure I do it in that order. I’ve always felt like that since I was young; my mother always put that in my head. By the fifth album, I will have walked down the aisle and I will at least be on baby number one, possibly baby number two. And have USD 500 million,”  Minaj said.

Adarsh Scam: Bombay HC rejects CBI plea to drop Ashok ChavansnameFormer Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan.
By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 2:04 pm | Updated: November 20, 2014 1:53 am
In a setback to former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, the Bombay High Court on Wednesday rejected the plea of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to drop Chavan’s name from the list of accused in the chargesheet in the Adarsh Society case.
In an order delivered through video-conference from Bombay High Court’s Nagpur bench, Justice M L Tahaliyani said he was inclined to reject the petition. He observed that the Special CBI judge took cognizance of the offence saying in “very unambiguous” language that Chavan’s exoneration for want of sanction from the Governor for prosecution of the offences under the IPC did not entitle relief from other offences under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act.
“It is, thus, clear that the learned trial judge has given a finding that despite the application by CBI for closing the case or deleting name of respondent number 2 (Chavan), it was not possible to do so because the offence punishable under Section 13 (2) (PC Act) is independent of the offences for which the sanction has been refused by the Governor. For all these reasons, the application has been rightly rejected. There is no substance in the revision application,” Justice Tahaliyani ruled.
Justice Tahaliyani had on October 15 reserved the order on the CBI’s application seeking Chavan’s discharge from the case. The CBI’s contention had been that the then Governor had refused to grant sanction for the prosecution of the former CM.
Chavan’s lawyer, senior counsel Amit Desai, had then said the likes of former CM Shivajirao Patil Nilangekar, former minister Jayant Patil and bureaucrat D Shankaran had not been made accused despite their relatives getting membership in the housing society.
As far as granting 15 per cent exemption for recreation ground (RG) space was concerned, Desai contended that not granting benefit of the exemption to the society would have meant discrimination as it was in public interest and led to legal implications. “The process had begun several months before he became the CM,” said Desai.
In addition, the CBI’s lawyer Hiten Venegaonkar had told the court that former Governor K Sankaranarayanan had refused to grant sanction on the ground that there was no material given by CBI to show criminal conspiracy or to prosecute him under Section 120 (b) of the IPC.
Relying on this, Venegaonkar contended that Section 13 1(d) (criminal misconduct by government servant) of the PCA would not stand as the allegations were only of granting exemption of 15 per cent RG to Adarsh, but it was within his powers.

Saif Ali Khan right person for Happy Ending: Director RajNidimoruPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 2:00 pm
“Our sense of humour is very similar. Saif is one actor who completely gives in to the character. He will never say no
to doing something on screen. It was a joy to watch him bring subtlety and freshness to a genre that has been around so
much.”
Romantic comedy is one of the most exploited genres in Bollywood and Saif Ali Khan comes with a good baggage of such movies but director Raj Nidimoru believes the actor’s familiarity with rom-com is actually a blessing for their upcoming release ‘Happy Ending’.  (See Pics: Happy Ending Screening )
“We were aware that Saif comes with a good baggage of romantic comedies and love stories. So, we figured out that he is the right person to have a take on them. He plays a scriptwriter in the film who is against such stories but has to write one,” Raj told PTI in an interview.
Raj and his co-collaborator Krishna DK, best known for their projects like ’99’, ‘Shor In The City’ and ‘Go Goa Gone’, found a willing partner in Saif, who was keen to work with them again after the success of the zombie comedy.
“Our sense of humour is very similar. Saif is one actor who completely gives in to the character. He will never say no to doing something on screen. It was a joy to watch him bring subtlety and freshness to a genre that has been around so much.”
Raj says the movie, releasing this Friday, is a quirkier take on the genre of romantic comedies while also reflecting on  their nature.
“We wanted to have a lighter take on romantic comedy. The film is very aware that it is a rom-com. We are hitting all the points till interval but despite being a bona fide romantic comedy, it goes beyond.
“The crux of every rom-com is happy ending. But there is also this thought process whether there is anything like ‘happy ending’ because end is always sad,” he said.
The film has Saif’s wife Kareena Kapoor and his ‘Kal Ho Naa Ho’ co-star Preity Zinta in cameo appearances.
“It is very gracious of such established stars to agree for a cameo. It shows how secure they are. Thankfully, they liked their characters a lot. Kareena and Preity’s presence lends certain authenticity to the story. Plus, it is fun to see real-life couple split on  screen,” Raj said.
 

Delhi HC issues notice to Haryana govt over Munak canal waterdisputePrint
Written by Aneesha Mathur | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:54 pm
The Delhi High Court on Wednesday issued notice to the Haryana government over the Munak canal water sharing dispute, saying it’s “tragic” that the issue has not been resolved yet while citizens are deprived of water.
A Bench of Justice BD Ahmed and Justice Siddharth Mridul issued notice to Haryana resident commissioner in Delhi after noting that over 80 MGD of water is being lost every day because of seepage as water is being transported through a katchcha canal instead of the concrete Munak canal.
A PIL had been filed before the court asking for commissioning of the new Munak canal. The case will now be heard next Wednesday.
In a related case filed by a retired army officer, work on completing the water supply pipeline from Haidatpur-Munak canal to Dwarka water treatment plant shall now begin as Delhi High court on Wednesday gave permission to DJB to lay down pipeline through private properties.

There was no dearth of entertainment as the Champions Tennis League kicked off to a bright start with Delhi Dreams beating Punjab Marshalls 25-19 at the R.K. Khanna Stadium here on Monday.
The spectators who packed more than half the capacity made for a vibrant atmosphere, but when the contest reached the climax with the towering Kevind Anderson taking on Somdev Devvarman, as Delhi led 19-18, a lot of spectators left the arena, possibly to watch the next match being played in Hyderabad, on television.
Even though co-owner Ajay Devgn asked the spectators to support Delhi, when he was interviewed midway through the tie, the high quality of tennis played by the former women’s world number 1 Jelena Jankovic and the Spaniard Garbine Muguruza made the fans forget their allegiance, and cheer both.

What clinched it in favour of Delhi was the solid start by the former world number 1 and French Open champion, Juan Carlos Ferrero as he outplayed a jet-lagged Greg Rusedski in the first rubber, and the 6’ 8” tall Kevin Anderson providing a strong finish. Delhi won all its three singles matches, while Punjab bonded well with Davis Cup hero Leander Paes winning the mixed doubles with Muguruza and the doubles with Somdev.
With his electrifying game and deft touch, Paes won a lot of applause. But, he was the first to make a ‘bow’ to his partners when they came up with delectable strokes. Without doubt, it was Paes who brought the crowd alive, after the fans had stayed silent initially.
It was ‘service with a smile’ as the contest opened up, but slowly the intensity of competition gripped the arena. It was the doubles matches that provided the best entertainment, as at least two singles matches became monotonously one-sided.
Even though the short-built Sanam played his heart out in the doubles with the Anderson, the latter did not look to be in the match, and even forgot that he was serving after two points in the fifth game. Perhaps, Anderson was preserving himself for the climax, as he did not allow Somdev to win a game after the first in the decisive fifth rubber.
It was an anti-climax, but nobody was complaining.
The results:
Delhi Dreams bt Punjab Marshalls 25-19 (Juan Carlos Ferrero bt Greg Rusedski 6-1; Jelena jankovic & Kevin Anderson lost to Garbine Muguruza & Leander Paes 3-6; Jelena Jankovic bt Garbine Muguruza 6-5(3); Kevin Anderson & Sanam Singh lost to Leander Paes & Somdev Devvarman 4-6; Kevin Anderson bt Somdev Devvarman 6-1).

Willow Smith: Going to school was the worst experience because I was depressedPrint
"I went to school for one year. It was the best experience but the worst experience. The best experience because I was, like, 'Oh, now I know why kids are so depressed.' But it was the worst experience because I was depressed," she said.

Singer Willow Smith, daughter of Hollywood star couple Will and Jade Pinkett Smith, has revealed going to school made her unhappy. The 14-year-old ‘Whip My Hair’ singer, who entered mainstream education for one year, said the only thing she discovered from the experience is that it makes kids sad, reported Contactmusic.
“I went to school for one year. It was the best experience but the worst experience. The best experience because I was, like, ‘Oh, now I know why kids are so depressed.’ But it was the worst experience because I was depressed,” she said.
Meanwhile, her brother Jaden, 16, insists people ‘never learn anything’ from school and he and Willow will do better because their learning ‘will never end’.
“You never learn anything in school. Think about how many car accidents happen every day. Driver’s ed? What’s up? I still haven’t been to driver’s ed because if everybody I know has been in an accident, I can’t see how driver’s ed is really  helping them out.
“School is not authentic because it ends. It’s not true, it’s not real. Our learning will never end. The school that we go to every single morning, we will continue to go to,” he said.

Justin Bieber studying the BibleThe 20-year-old star was arrested for DUI (Driving Under the Influence) in Miami earlier this year and also charged with vandalising his former neighbour's home with eggs in Calabasas, California.

Pop sensation Justin Bieber has cleared his schedule to study the Bible with his pastor for the next two weeks in Palm Springs, California, as he wants to learn how to spread the word of God.
The 20-year-old star was arrested for DUI (Driving Under the Influence) in Miami earlier this year and also charged with vandalising his former neighbour’s home with eggs in Calabasas, California.
Bieber is staying at the Rancho Mirage close to Palm Springs, California for two weeks with his pastor, as he wants to firmly reconnect with his religious beliefs, reported TMZ online.
A source said the ‘Baby’ hitmaker, who recently split from his on-again, off-again girlfriend Selena Gomez, is on a “mission” to learn how to spread the word of God and has exiled himself from his friends, alcohol and marijuana for the remainder of November.
The Canadian singer – who identifies himself as a Christian – was spotted outside the luxurious resort with the book ‘Occupy All Streets,’ which teaches how to resist bad temptations.
Bieber has surrounded himself with spiritual mentors in recent months, including pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong New York City, who previously insisted he is a ‘good kid’ despite his bad behaviour.
The singer also frequently attended pastor Judah Smith’s Bible study at the City Church in Los Angeles with the ‘Heart Wants What It Wants’ hitmaker Selena, 22, over the summer.

Stand-up comedians become better film actors  says Sunil PalBy: Press Trust of India | Panaji | Posted: November 19, 2014 2:17 pm
Comedian-turned-actor Sunil Pal says stand-up comedians turn out to be better actors in films as they know the pulse of the audience after having performed live shows.
“When a stand-up comedian does a film, he does it better as he is always live in front of the audience and has the knack of assessing the public’s feelings,” Sunil Pal told PTI.
The winner of the first season of TV show ‘The Great Indian Laughter Challenge’ was in Goa to promote his upcoming Hindi film ‘Money Back Guaranteed’. He said comedians becoming heroes was a good indication. “People are trying to become stars banking on the comedy element. If you have seen, only heroes doing comedy are surviving,” he said.
“Those who do serious roles, later return to comedy to get hit movies. You can see the trend right from Ajay Devgn, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan and even Shahrukh Khan in ‘Chennai Express’, everyone is doing comedy. Even Aamir Khan’s next movie ‘PK’ is a comedy,” Sunil Pal said.
Pal, who made his directorial debut with the film ‘Bhavnaao Ko Samjho’, said stand-up comedians are now the busiest artists, right from television to feature films.
“For stand-up comedians there are opportunities opening up. They are sought after everywhere… I would say television is a golden screen for them. On TV and stage they shine like a diamond,” he said.
Sunil Pal said his upcoming film ‘Money Back Guaranteed’, set to release on November 21, has a social message.
“One of the movie songs is trending on Facebook. It is one of the seven most heard songs on the social media,” he said.

Top spots to visit for romantic experiencesStory
The Romance of Travel
Amrita Chowdhury        Edition: Oct 26, 2014
Amalfi is the perfect place to whisk off your loved one on a passionate getaway in true storybook style
Romance and travel are linked in more ways than one. The former brings about an emotional intensity and a yearning for togetherness with your loved one in a bubble of seclusion, something that is best provided by a ticket to the nearest island nation. No wonder, then, that scores of Mills and Boon books work on the same theme, where the gorgeous hero and his lady love escape to a picturesque destination and rediscover their passions far away from the travails of everyday life. Here are my top spots to visit for romantic experiences in all their varied hues and flavours.
By the sea | Amalfi Coast, Italy
The beautiful Costa Amalfitana whispers romance along every turn on the winding coast-hugging highway south of Napoli. Dotted with picturesque villages stuck to the edges of rugged green hills, complete with bougainvillea-laden villas cantilevered over the shimmering sea, you can almost imagine yourself inside a Gran Turismo ride. Take your loved one on a walk along the cobblestoned streets of Sorrento, Positano or Amalfi, shopping at tiny boutiques, and parking yourself under the occasional roadside tree. Stop by the ancient ruins of Pompeii in the shadows of the Vesuvius, following by a boat ride across the blue-green sea to the fabulous isle of Capri.

NATURE LOVERS Valle dei Mulini Amalfi
LOVE FOR FOOD | Australia There is an openness to experimentation and a culinary affection among individual elements that make Australia such a gastronomic delight for nouvelle cuisine, and this was known much before MasterChef Australia even came about. Coasts, cowboy countrysides and chic cities define this large country. Try a kangaroo steak under the stars in the shadow of a looming Uluru, or enjoy freshly caught barramundi or mud crabs at a tucked away coastal town. Enjoy authentic dishes from the kitchens of Asian, European and Middle Eastern migrants, or savour fusion cuisines in eclectic restaurants by the harbour.

FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD | Scotland
Give the bustling cathedrals and castles of Edinburgh and Glasgow a miss and head for the atmospheric countryside. Millenniums of history and legends breathe life into the Scottish highlands, and along their tortuous firths. Stop at peaty gurgling brooks and stone-carved distilleries along the Whiskey Trail. Explore ruined castles and palatial homes in sleepy hamlets, finding space and time for solitude. Drive past the purple-brown moors and dense green hills, deep lochs and little inlets of the north and the west. Tee off in one of the original greens alongthe eastern side. It's easy to imagine peace and togetherness in this wild and scenic region. Even if you aren't keen on the haggis, do make it a point to try their melt-in-the-mouth fudge.

ISLAND GETAWAY | Caribbean Islands
Nothing conjures romance better than spending some time on a washed away isle in warm waters, or sinking your feet in soft golden or pink sands outside your secluded beach villa. No wonder, then, that it's a favourite among jetsetters looking for down time. Though the Caribbean offers many an option, you will do well to skip the glitz and glamour of Riviera casinos and - instead - opt for some together-time on a castaway island. From the reggae beats and Indian-African influenced foods of Jamaica to the utter seclusion of the Virgin Islands, you can find your own personal beach haven.

CCIL launches legal entity identifier servicesUpdated: November 18, 2014 22:49 IST
CCIL launches legal entity identifier services
Special Correspondent
new service
The Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) on Tuesday launched its services as a local operating unit (LOU) for issuing globally compatible legal entity identifiers (LEIs) in India.
The LEI is a 20-charactrer unique identity number assigned to entities which are parties to a financial transaction. As part of the global initiative to have a structure to identify legal entities across the globe in a unique manner, CCIL has been appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for rendering this service for Indian entities undertaking financial transactions.
Initially all entities undertaking OTC derivative transactions will be required to obtain LEI and include the same in the derivative transactions reported. The obligation may, in due course, be expanded to cover other entities and other markets and asset classes, CCIL said in a press release.

Family finances: health coverage do-over0
Most employers offer open enrollment during the fall. If you buy health insurance on your own, you have from November 15, 2014, to February 15, 2015, to pick your plan for 2015. For the second year, insurers can no longer reject you or charge you higher rates because of a preexisting condition, and premiums for older people are capped. That makes it easier to switch to a new policy every year.
Even if you liked your coverage over the past year, you may benefit from switching. "The plans that were competitive in 2014 may not be as competitive in 2015," says Elizabeth Carpenter, of Avalere Health, a consulting firm.
You may have more options this time; 77 insurers will be selling policies on the health insurance exchanges for the first time in 2015, a 25-percent increase from last year. Some big insurers that only dipped their toe in the exchanges in 2014 will bump up their presence significantly. UnitedHealthcare, for example, sold policies on four exchanges but plans to sell on as many as 24 for 2015; Cigna is entering three more states.
Average premium increases vary a lot by state because competition and insurers' claims costs vary. A study of nine state exchanges by Avalere Health found average premiums for silver plans increasing by as much as 16 percent in Indiana but just 2.5 percent in Rhode Island. Premiums in Oregon will average 1.4 percent lower.
But premiums are just part of the picture. Many plans continue to shrink their provider networks, boost deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs, and add more hurdles before covering expensive drugs and procedures. The policy with the lowest premiums may cost you more when you start to use the coverage.
If you have insurance at work, don't let inertia take over during open enrollment. Employers have been struggling to find creative ways to rein in rising costs. Some are giving their health coverage a major overhaul; others are introducing stealth changes that could boost your costs significantly.
And whether you get your health insurance through your employer or on your own, compare your options and make sure you're getting the most out of your coverage.

Stability of Fadnavis govt not our responsibility: NCPPrint
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:51 am
A day after the BJP took the initiative to reopen talks with the Shiv Sena to try and bring on board its erstwhile ally, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who had offered unconditional support to the ruling party after last month’s polls, put the government on notice by predicting the possibility of mid-term polls in Maharashtra.
At a two-day NCP conclave which began on Tuesday at Alibaug, Pawar told party workers to gear up for mid-term elections in the state. Adopting an aggressive posture against the BJP, he said that ensuring the stability of the Maharashtra government is not NCP’s responsibility.
The NCP had until now defended its stand on offering unconditional support to the BJP government saying that it wanted to provide stability in the larger interest of the state.
The change in stance is viewed in political circles as another political ploy by Pawar to reassert the significance of his party in state politics. A former cabinet minister from the NCP, who is part of the core group, told The Indian Express that  Pawar’s master stroke at the conclave was to defuse the growing unrest within the organisation following his offer to the BJP. Also, it comes at a time when Pawar reckons that there is a strong prospect of the Sena giving its nod to join the BJP led government in Maharashtra, he said.
Given the latest developments involving the BJP and the Sena, Pawar wants to seize the opposition space for the NCP instead of the Congress, which was more belligerent after the vote of confidence. Pawar also realises that a Sena-BJP alliance would spell fresh trouble as the BJP-led government may take the alleged corruption cases against some NCP ministers in the previous government to the logical end.
Taking the combined strength of the BJP (121) and the Sena (63) would make for a comfortable tally of 184 in the 288-member Assembly. The NCP, which has 41 members, reckons it would be redundant if the Sena joins the BJP. The Congress (42) has taken on the mantle of the Opposition party in the state.
The BJP does not appear to be fazed by the NCP’s veiled threat. BJP leaders said that the party did not take support from the NCP during the  trust vote in the Assembly on November 12. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “The people of Maharashtra have voted for my government for five years. The government is stable. We are confident of completing our full tenure and fulfilling the aspirations of the people across Maharashtra.”
Fadnavis also reiterated, “BJP will always welcome Shiv Sena in government.”
Sena president Uddhav Thackeray also chided Pawar saying that he says one thing and does another. “He never walks the talk,” Uddhav said.

Sensex  Nifty fall after scaling new peaksMarket update: Sensex slips from peak, Nifty closes below 8,400

The benchmark Sensex on Wednesday logged new lifetime high of 28,294.01 but retreated after a late fall gripped stocks to end 130 points down at 28,032.85, amid profit-taking in bluechips from metal, power and oil and gas space.
The BSE 30-share barometer, after hitting the new peak in the opening trade, succumbed to profit-booking and selling by foreign funds at record levels. At one point, it slipped below the 28,000-mark to touch the day's low of 27,963.51.
The gauge settled 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, lower at 28,032.85. On Tuesday, it had touched intra-day high of 28,282.85 but had ended with a loss of 14.59 points.
Major losers that pulled down Sensex and Nifty from record highs included Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite, GAIL, BHEL, Tata Motors, NTPC, Sun Pharma, ONGC , CIL , RIL and SBI.
Similarly, the NSE 50-scrip index Nifty after scaling a new peak of 8,455.65 at the outset, beating previous record of 8,454.50 touched on Tuesday, fell. It ended below the 8,400-mark to close with a loss of 43.60 points, or 0.52 per cent, at 8,382.30. Intra-day, it had touched a low of 8360.50.
Traders said besides profit-booking, a mixed trend in global markets ahead of the release of minutes of Federal Reserve policy meeting, led to the fall in Indian shares.
"Market remained in a very narrow range for most part of the trading session and corrected in the last 90 minutes of the trading session. Stocks that were top performing in the first half of the trading session, were the ones that corrected the most in the second half of the trading session," said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.
The local currency also appeared to be having a bad day with rupee trading near 62-levels against the US dollar.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors sold shares worth Rs 101.98 crore on Tuesday, first net sales in almost 3 weeks.
Sectorally, the BSE Metal index suffered the most by losing 2.14 per cent, followed by Power index which fell 1.80 per cent, Oil and Gas index by 1.35 per cent, Consumer Durables by 1.22 per cent and Realty index by 0.99 per cent.
Selling activity also gained momentum in small and mid-cap sector stocks. The BSE Small-cap index lost 0.65 per cent and Mid-cap index fell 0.63 per cent.
Bucking the trend, Dr Reddy, HUL, HDFC, Bajaj Auto, Airtel, L&T, Infosys and ICICI Bank ended up.
Jignesh Chaudhary, Head of Research, Veracity Broking Services said: "Indian equities opened positively, but as the day progressed, the indices lost their way. Indices are trading near all time highs so investors preferred to stay cautious at these levels."
Overall, 22 out of 30 Sensex-based scrips ended with losses while others settled with gains.
Major losers from the Sensex pack include Tata Steel (3.08 per cent), Sesa Sterlite (2.75 per cent), Gail India (2.30 per cent), Tata Motors (2.29 per cent), BHEL (1.99 per cent), NTPC (1.94 per cent) and Sun Pharma (1.77 per cent).
ONGC (1.69 per cent), Coal India (1.58 per cent), Cipla (1.47 per cent), M&M (1.43 per cent) and Reliance Industries (1.01 per cent) also were among laggards.
However, Dr Reddy's Lab rose by 2.45 per cent, HUL 1.19 per cent, HDFC 1.01 per cent, Bajaj Auto 1.01 per cent and Bharti Airtel 0.89 per cent.
Among the S&P BSE sectoral indices, metal fell by 2.14 per cent, followed by power 1.80 per cent, oil & gas 1.35 per cent, consumer durables 1.22 per cent, realty 0.99 per cent, bankex 0.65 per cent and auto 0.64 per cent.
Total market breadth turned negative as 1,840 stocks finished in red, 1,216 stocks closed in green while 95 ruled steady. Total turnover rose further to Rs 3,848.52 crore from Rs 3,657.51 crore on Tuesday.

Suspected US strikes hit Syrian al-Qaida-held townPicture for representational purpose only (Source: AP)
Beirut (ap) | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:44 pm
Two activist groups say an airstrike believed to have been carried out by the US led coalition has targeted a town controlled by al-Qaida militants in northwestern Syria.
The Local Coordination Committees and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Tuesday that the strike hit the town of Harem in Syria’s Idlib province overnight. There was no immediate word on casualties.
It also was not immediately clear what was targeted, but Harem is controlled by al-Qaida’s Syrian branch, known as the Nusra Front. US aircraft bombed Nusra militants near Harem last week.
If the latest strike is confirmed, it would mark the fourth time that American aircraft have targeted the al-Qaida affiliate in the US led coalition’s broader aerial campaign against Islamic extremists in Syria and Iraq.

Ebola: Situation under complete control  says J PNaddaPrint

By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:01 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 7:52 pm
A day after the first Ebola case was reported in India, Health Minister J P Nadda on Wednesday said arrangements similar to the one at Delhi airport, which helped detect the virus in a man returning from Liberia, have been put in place at 24 airports and stressed the situation was under “complete control”.
The detection of the virus in the 26-year-old man, who reached here on November 10, was a result of “extra caution” shown by the government, he told reporters.
“Due to its extra caution, the Health Ministry tested body fluids of the man even after his blood tested negative for Ebola. I want to say the situation is under complete control. We have similar arrangements at 24 airports across the country,” he told reporters.
The tour and medical history of passengers are being checked at airports, he said.
The man will remain quarantined at a special facility at Delhi airport so long as medical reports confirm that he is completely rid of the virus.
The man was treated for Ebola in Liberia and carried certificate from authorities there that he was cured of it.
The ministry had said the man was already treated for the deadly disease in the African country and carried no symptoms but tests of his semen samples were positive, prompting authorities to put him under isolation.

After a five-year courtship, actor Vir Das tied the knot with girlfriend Shivani Mathur at a secret ceremony in Sri Lanka.
The duo exchanged vows on Oct 19.  “We wanted to have a small ceremony for our wedding. There were only about 100 people, comprising family and close friends,” Vir said in a statement.
“I preferred my wedding to be a quiet affair. The rule at the wedding event was that everyone switched off their smart phones to spend quality time with each other,” he added.
The wedding consisted of a pool party, a rock concert, the sangeet ceremony and then the pheras.
“Owing to Vir and Shivani’s busy schedule, the couple haven’t had the time to go for a honeymoon, but would be soon taking time out,” said a source.
The actor will be seen in films like “Santa Banta” and “Mastizaade” that will release in the first half of 2015.

Singer Willow Smith, daughter of Hollywood star couple Will and Jade Pinkett Smith, has revealed going to school made her unhappy. The 14-year-old ‘Whip My Hair’ singer, who entered mainstream education for one year, said the only thing she discovered from the experience is that it makes kids sad, reported Contactmusic.
“I went to school for one year. It was the best experience but the worst experience. The best experience because I was, like, ‘Oh, now I know why kids are so depressed.’ But it was the worst experience because I was depressed,” she said.
Meanwhile, her brother Jaden, 16, insists people ‘never learn anything’ from school and he and Willow will do better because their learning ‘will never end’.
“You never learn anything in school. Think about how many car accidents happen every day. Driver’s ed? What’s up? I still haven’t been to driver’s ed because if everybody I know has been in an accident, I can’t see how driver’s ed is really  helping them out.
“School is not authentic because it ends. It’s not true, it’s not real. Our learning will never end. The school that we go to every single morning, we will continue to go to,” he said.

Justin Bieber studying theBibleThe 20-year-old star was arrested for DUI (Driving Under the Influence) in Miami earlier this year and also charged with vandalising his former neighbour's home with eggs in Calabasas, California.

Pop sensation Justin Bieber has cleared his schedule to study the Bible with his pastor for the next two weeks in Palm Springs, California, as he wants to learn how to spread the word of God.
The 20-year-old star was arrested for DUI (Driving Under the Influence) in Miami earlier this year and also charged with vandalising his former neighbour’s home with eggs in Calabasas, California.
Bieber is staying at the Rancho Mirage close to Palm Springs, California for two weeks with his pastor, as he wants to firmly reconnect with his religious beliefs, reported TMZ online.
A source said the ‘Baby’ hitmaker, who recently split from his on-again, off-again girlfriend Selena Gomez, is on a “mission” to learn how to spread the word of God and has exiled himself from his friends, alcohol and marijuana for the remainder of November.
The Canadian singer – who identifies himself as a Christian – was spotted outside the luxurious resort with the book ‘Occupy All Streets,’ which teaches how to resist bad temptations.
Bieber has surrounded himself with spiritual mentors in recent months, including pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong New York City, who previously insisted he is a ‘good kid’ despite his bad behaviour.
The singer also frequently attended pastor Judah Smith’s Bible study at the City Church in Los Angeles with the ‘Heart Wants What It Wants’ hitmaker Selena, 22, over the summer.

Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel expands ministry  inducts 4 newministersAnandiben Patel
By: Express News Service | Gandhinagar | Posted: November 19, 2014 2:19 pm
Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel inducted four new ministers into her government, taking the total ministry up to 24, including herself.
Governor O P Kohli administered the oath of office to Cabinet ministers Mangubhai Patel and newly elected MLA Vijay Rupani, besides ministers of state Parshottam Solanki and Jashabhai Barad at the Raj Bhavan on Wednesday. The expansion has given a boost to representation from the Saurashtra region where BJP did not fare well in the by-elections recently.
Patel, a tribal, represents Gandevi (ST) seat, Rupani, who is a first time minister in the Gujarat government is from Rajkot (West) seat, Koli strongman Solanki is from Bhavnagar (Rural) seat and Barad is from Somnath seat
PROFILES
VIJAY RUPANI
A former Rajya Sabha MP and state general secretary Vijay Rupani won his first assembly seat from Rajkot West, and was rewarded with a cabinet berth for his more than two-decade-old work for the BJP in Saurashtra, known as the BJP’s cradle. A Jain by caste, he won the Rajkot west by-election, which was necessitated following incumbent MLA and Gujarat assembly speaker Vajubhai Vala being appointed as Karnataka governor. Rupani has been been close to both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. Modi also contested and won his first election from the same seat in 2002. Based in Rajkot, Rupani has played a role of Modi’s organizational man in Saurashtra region. Rupani is also the party’s spokesperson.
MANGUBHAI PATEL
Just before being elevated as cabinet minister, Mangubhai Patel resigned from the post of deputy speaker. A tribal from south Gujarat, he has served as minister of state and even cabinet minister in the past. Recently, Ganpatbhai Vasava, another tribal MLA from south Gujarat, was shifted from the cabinet to the post of Speaker of Gujarat Assembly.
Tribals form 15% population of Gujarat. Tribal ministers have usually held portfolios of forest and environment and tribal development.
JASHA BARAD
A BJP rebel who participated in the rebellion led by Shankersinh Vaghela to topple the Keshubhai Patel government in 1996, Jasa Barad was back in the BJP fold only ahead of Lok Sabha 2014 elections. Karadiya by caste, BJP fielded him again from Somnath in the by-election, which he earlier represented as Congress MLA. After Vajubhai Vala was made governor of Karnataka, there was no leader from Karadia Rajput community at a position of power in Gandhinagar. Barad has been Chairman of Junagadh district bank and Junagadh Kheti bank. He has been vice-president in Gujarat Congress also.
PARSHOTTAM SOLANKI
A leader of the fishing community of Kolis from Saurashtra, Purshottam Solanki is back in the ministry after being dropped by Anandiben Patel in May, soon after she became CM. A former TADA accused, Solanki was mired into controversy following corruption allegations in fishing contracts. It had cost him his fisheries portfolio as junior minister, though he had emerged giant killer in 2012 assembly elections by defeating Congress leader Gohil. It was pressure from Koli community, which forms largest vote bank continued…

CMS Info Systems workers script its successCEO Rajiv Kaul: Keeping employees engaged and motivated (Photo: Nishikant Gamre)
CATEGORY: Excellence in Productive Employment Creation (Large Companies)
In September, a CMS Info Systems employee travelling in a company truck with Rs 44 lakh in cash was stranded when floods hit Jammu and Kashmir. The cash manager also lost contact with the company's control room. Five days later, he called back saying that when he realised the truck couldn't be saved, he took the cash in a bag and escaped to a nearby village where he stayed with an acquaintance. The employee said that he couldn't charge his mobile phone or get a message out because there was no electricity in the village and that he would soon return to work - with all the cash he had.
Given the chaos and the fragile law and order situation due to the floods, the money could have easily disappeared, stolen or simply become unaccounted for. This could have hurt the company's reputation. But the motivated employee ensured that never happened. According to CMS CEO Rajiv Kaul, pride, passion and performance of its employees - the three Ps - is what makes the company so productive and successful. To reward acts of dedication to work and honesty, the company has also instituted the CMS Lion-Heart Medal of Honour award.
CMS is India's largest and the world's fifth-largest cash management company. It employs people, trucks and technology to move cash to and from 55,000 of the country's estimated 165,000 ATMs. It has 15,230 employees as on March 2014, up 7.14 per cent from the year ago figure of 14,215. Of the total manpower, 98 per cent work on the field while the remaining are branch managers and senior management.

To manage its employees and ensure that the demanding nature of the job doesn't get the better of them, CMS uses decentralised people management. It also tries to help solve problems locally, and not let them become major headaches for the board later, says Kaul.
Kaul cites a third-party survey, where 89 per cent of CMS employees said that their work had a 'special meaning' for them and was not just a job. He says compensation and career advancement of all employees are well taken care of. In fact, in 2009 and 2010, just after the global financial meltdown, CMS employees received one of the best annual increments ever. The reason was simple. People want good rewards if the company does well, but they expect even more if the economy is doing badly, says Kaul. These efforts are paying off. The company reported profit after tax per employee of Rs 1 lakh in 2013/14, a sharp 69 per cent increase from 2012/13.

MRLs have larger impact on tea trade  feels FAOUpdated: November 17, 2014 22:48 IST
MRLs have larger impact on tea trade, feels FAO
Indrani Dutta
Tweet
The Hindu
The FAO felt that the MRL standards had a much larger effect on trade than import tariffs, and any cost-related disruption in supply could increase prices, leading to price volatility.
TOPICS
pesticides
At a time when the residue level in Indian teas is being debated, the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) Inter-governmental Group on tea has found that, in general, food safety standards might have a deterring effect on trade if exporters fail to comply with regulations.
The implications of MRLs (maximum residue levels) on tea trade were discussed by the Inter-governmental Group at its recent meeting in Indonesia. It is a forum for inter-governmental consultation and exchange on trends in production, consumption, trade and price of tea.
The FAO felt that the MRL standards had a much larger effect on trade than import tariffs, and any cost-related disruption in supply could increase prices, leading to price volatility.
As one of the food safety standards, MRLs set the maximum level of pesticide residue that can be traced in food and food products to ensure food safety.
MRL regulations vary across countries, and there is no international agreement on harmonisation of regulations. The European Union has increased the number of pesticides regulated for tea. The number is now 45.
The FAO study found that China’s export to major European partners decreased significantly after 2000, most likely due to the regulations. The FAO also noted that if the importing country was large enough, prices would rise in that particular import market following the supply-disruption It might also have a negative impact for employment and gender, especially in developing countries.
India recently came under attack from Greenpeace which alleged that Indian teas were laced with banned pesticides.
The Tea Board of India maintains that Indian tea is subject to some of the most stringent standards globally, and 37 Plant Protection Codes (PCC) (chemicals) have been identified as permissible for use in Indian tea growth. MRLs are also in place.
The PPC is a comprehensive document, which lays down the manner in which chemicals are going to be used safely in tea cultivation.

Private study urges overhaul of commuter parking and transit tax benefits.By Paul Duggan November 18
(Robert Thomson/The Washington Post)
With mass-transit advocates fighting for a change in federal tax rules that would make commuting more affordable on public transportation (and a little less so for motorists), some new voices have joined the discussion. In a study released Tuesday , two groups argue that the entire system of tax breaks for drivers and rail users should be overhauled.
“The tax exclusions for commuter parking and transit are costly and work at cross purposes,” according to Frontier Group, a clean-environment think tank in California, and TransitCenter, a New York organization that describes itself as “an independent civic philanthropy” dedicated to improving public transportation.
“The nation’s commuter tax benefits also fail to reward travel choices such as carpooling, carsharing and bikesharing that reduce vehicle commutes and/or improve the efficiency of the transportation system,” the study points out.
Some background:
Public transportation users whose employers participate in the federally supported benefits program can have up to $130 deducted from their monthly incomes, before taxes, to pay for transit fares. But workers who commute by automobile are eligible for a maximum pre-tax deduction of $250 a month for parking fees.
Transit advocates and agencies, including Metro, complain that the disparity creates an incentive for workday commuters to drive rather than use public transportation. A bill in the lame-duck Congress would level the playing field, setting the transit and parking benefits at $235 each. But it’s unclear what chance the legislation has of becoming law.
After studying the impact of the commuter benefits programs in big urban areas across the country, TransitCenter and Frontier Group recommended that Congress scrap the tax break for parking and make wholesale changes to the transit benefit.
In addition to supporting the argument by Metro and others that the tax break for parking steers workers away from public transportation, the report says that the parking benefit tends to be unavailable to low-income workers because, in many cases, their employers don’t participate in the program.
“Ultimately, the effect of the tax benefit for commuter parking is to subsidize traffic congestion by putting roughly 820,000 more cars on America’s most congested roads in its most congested cities at the most congested times of day,” the study says. “It delivers the greatest benefits to those who need them least, typically upper-income Americans, and costs $7.3 billion in reduced tax revenue that must be made up through cuts in government programs, a higher deficit or increases in taxes on other Americans.”
The report also criticizes the current transit tax-break program, saying it is used by “an estimated 2.7 million commuters, or about 2 percent of U.S. workers” and “weakly counteracts the negative impact of the parking tax benefit.”
Like the tax benefit for parking, “the transit tax benefit disproportionately aids those with higher incomes who work for large employers in dense downtown districts,” the study says. “Lower-income workers are less than one-fifth as likely to have access to subsidized transit benefits through the workplace as higher-income workers.”
To make the transit benefit more widely available, the report says, “the federal government should explore replacements … such as refundable tax credits for transit expenditures,” which would “deliver financial support to a broader range of transit system users while making the system more equitable.” In that way, “workers at organizations that do not offer a transit benefit program” would still be able to take advantage of the tax savings.
The report notes that in recent years, in addition to traditional carpooling, “there has been an explosion of new options for shared mobility, including various models of carsharing and bikesharing.” TransitCenter and Frontier Group urged federal policymakers to fashion tax benefits that extend to people using those modes of transportation, as well.
“The government should update its tax incentives to influence travel demand so that they fit the needs of today’s commuters,” TransitCenter’s executive director, David Bragdon, said in a statement. “Regardless of whether the Treasury is spending dollars or not collecting them in the first place, those dollars ought to be targeted for maximum positive impact on our transportation system.”
 

White House chief of staff  Senate Democrats to huddleBy Ed O'Keefe November 18 Follow @edatpost
File: White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough walks past reporters. (AP/Charles Dharapak)
White House Chief of Staff Denis R. McDonough plans to huddle on Thursday with Democratic senators -- yet another sign that President Obama is preparing to act soon to revamp the nation's immigration laws.
A senior congressional aide familiar with the plans confirm the plans, but would only say that McDonough will attend the weekly Democratic policy lunch "to discuss the economy and priorities in the lame duck" session of Congress.
But the biggest White House priority these days is immigration and Obama has promised to use his executive authority to make changes in immigration policy at some point after the midterm elections and the end of the year.
Another potential subject of conversation could be the sensitive, months-long negotiations over the release of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s long-anticipated report on the CIA’s detention and interrogation program.
McDonough has been personally negotiating with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the Senate intelligence panel chairman, about what portions of her report should be redacted.
Feinstein is said to be pushing to release her report, which took more than five years to prepare, before she loses control of the committee at the end of the year.
McDonough has visited Capitol Hill or hosted Democrats at the White House on several occasions to discuss immigration reform. He and other senior White House or administration officials huddle frequently with Democrats behind closed doors at the U.S. Capitol, usually during regularly-scheduled meetings. Such visits usually coincide with major policy announcements or to plot strategy in the years-long feud between the administration and congressional Republicans.
Anticipating that Obama is on the verge of taking action, congressional Democrats have spent much of the past week publishing op-eds, giving speeches and sitting for television interviews to preemptively defend Obama against anticipated GOP criticism of his decision.
Dozens of House Democrats co-signed a letter last week supporting Obama, while top Senate Democrats sent him a letter of support this week.
And in an interview with Spanish-language network Univision , Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) hinted that Obama could take steps "as soon as this week."
"I think it should be done now," Reid added in the interview.
On Tuesday, Reid told reporters, "When the president decides to do his executive order, he should go big, as big as he can."

Halftime Report highlights  week of November 10th
Chaffetz to succeed Issa as House oversight chairmanBy Josh Hicks November 18 Follow @reporter_hicks

Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) on Tuesday won a four-way race to succeed Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) next year as chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
The GOP’s House Steering Committee selected Chaffetz over Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), John Mica (R-Fla.) and Mike Turner (R-Ohio).
“The faith placed in me by my colleagues today is a tremendous honor and privilege,” the future chairman said in a statement. “I am fully committed to taking on difficult tasks that a chairmanship requires.
Turner posed perhaps the stiffest challenge in the race for the gavel, particularly because he and House Speaker John Boehner (R), a member of the steering committee, both hail from Ohio.
But Chaffetz, who heads the oversight panel’s subcommittee on national security, has led reviews of some high-profile issues in recent years, including the Secret Service’s botched handling of White House security breaches and the agency’s Colombia prostitution scandal .
Issa, the term-limited current head of the oversight panel, described the future chairman as a “valued colleague and demonstrated leader who will continue the work of the Oversight Committee in the next Congress.”
Rep Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the committee’s top Democrat, said he looks forward to working with Chaffetz, according to an article from The Hill . “I am encouraged that Rep. Chaffetz has shown a sincere interest in working together and focusing on reform, and I hope this bipartisanship continues,” he said.

Ranjit Sinha challenges claims over diary caseCBI chief challenges Prashant Bhushan's claims in SC over visitors' list case
Harish V Nair     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 20, 2014  | 19:01 IST
CBI Director Ranjit Sinha
CBI Director Ranjit Sinha came out with all guns blazing in the Supreme Court on Tuesday to defend himself in a case pertaining to the visitors' diary, maintained at his official residence, which allegedly showed that he met several persons who are accused in cases that being probed by the agency.
This forced a Bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu to ask pointed questions to lawyer Prashant Bhushan on why he should not be directed to reveal the name of the "whistleblower" who gave him a copy of the diary and several other confidential notings from CBI files.
"The reason cited by Bhushan for not revealing the name of his source is scandalous. He is not even ready to trust the Supreme Court judges who asked him to file the name in a sealed cover which will only be seen by them and no one else. He says it would endanger the life of his source. Is he expecting the judges of this court to do bodily harm?" Sinha's lawyer Vikas Singh asked.
After hearing Singh for almost an hour, Dattu asked lawyer Dushyant Dave, who represented Bhushan,"Our direction was that the information was for us only. You can't even reveal it to us?"
When Dave responded that "the information was received on the condition that the name will not be shared with anyone", Dattu asked, "Did he also say to not share it with the court?"
Dave maintained that Bhushan's NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation received such information and documents from sources who wished to keep their identity secret and any disclosure would deter them in future.
The court will continue hearing on Wednesday.
The Bench's remarks were significant as it was widely believed that the judges would accept Special Public Prosecutor Anand Grover's opinion that Bhushan should not be forced to reveal the source as it may have implications on other sensitive cases depending significantly on information provided by whistleblowers.
Referring to a 2011 ruling, Singh argued that Bhushan's affidavit, based on the visitors' diary , will be in conformity with the apex court rules only if he revealed its source.
Singh challenged Bhushan's claim that he received the diary from a "reliable whistleblower", saying the "concept of the whistleblower would only arise if one is dealing with crimes committed where the whistleblower needs protection against the persons against whom some disclosure is sought to be made".
The CBI chief is set to retire on December 2.
BATTING FOR HIS CASE
Sinha cites the following cases to drive home his point that SC should reject affidavits carrying any information that do not reveal the source:
AMAR SINGH vs UNION OF INDIA (2011)
SC registry must scrutinise all affidavits and reject all those which are not in conformity with SC rules. Sinha says SC Registry ought to have rejected the Common Cause petition as the source of the documents was not revealed.
STATE OF BOMBAY vs PURUSHOTTAM NAIK (1952)
SC rejected an affidavit based on "personal knowledge" as its source was not disclosed. "This is slipshod verification on the part of the registry. Such affidavits should not be taken on record", the SC had then said.
R.C. JAIN vs HIGH COURT OF PATNA (1996)
SC questioned counsel for petitioner on how he produced a copy of a confidential official note. "A duty is cast on him to explain the source from where he obtained it," it said.

Salman Khan’s baby sister Arpita Khan tied the knot to Delhi-based businessman Aayush Sharma in an extravagant wedding ceremony on Tuesday (November 18), at the Taj Falaknuma hotel in Hyderabad.
The main wedding ceremony kicked off with the ‘baraat’ at 4:30 pm. The ‘baraat’ included horses and two bands, one from Delhi and one from Hyderabad. It was followed by the ‘jaimala’ and ‘phere’. The wedding rituals were performed as per Punjabi Hindu traditions.
Salman Khan’s father Salim Khan, mother Salma, brothers Arbaaz, Sohail and other family members received the baraat and blessed the couple, who exchanged garlands.
Post the wedding rituals, the celebrations, which were no less than royal, had the who’s who of the country on its guest list. Being an influential family in the film fraternity, The Big Fat Khan wedding had stars including Salman Khan’s very close friend Aamir Khan, wife Kiran Rao, Salman’s ex girlfriend Katrina Kaif, actress Priyanka Chopra, filmmaker Karan Johar, Kabir Khan, actor Riteish Deshmukh in attendance. Singers Mika Singh and Yo Yo Honey Singh were also present to get the party started.

Actor Aamir Khan, who is known to share a special friendship with Salman, was seen being very much a part of the wedding festivities. He even accompanied the bridal couple Amrita and Aayush along with Salman for the media interactions post the nuptials.
Katrina Kaif, on the other hand, maybe a former flame of the bride’s brother, but the actress is very close to the Khan family, especially Arpita. She was stunning in a white outfit, as she par took in the wedding celebrations.
However, boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor and his parents Neetu Singh, Rishi Kapoor were reportedly not invited for the big wedding. Ranbir’s sister Riddhima did receive an initiation, but was unable to attend it.
Actress Priyanka Chopra also made it a point to attend the Khan wedding in a gorgeous royal blue Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla sari with a rich gold border. Filmmakers Karan Johar, Kabir Khan and his wife Mini Mathur were also seen having a gala time as they shared pictures from the wedding.
Salman Khan played the perfect big brother as he took all the pains to see that his little sister’s big day was absolutely perfect. The actor, who is known to be a bit shy when it comes to crooning in public, made an exception and sang ‘Jumma Chumma’ along with Aamir who couldn’t keep from joining continued…

Secular ideals of Indira Gandhi more relevant today: TMCBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: November 19, 2014 2:16 pm
Days after party supremo Mamata Banerjee hailed Jawaharlal Nehru’s ideals of secularism, TMC leaders on Wednesday lauded Indira Gandhi’s nationalist ideology and said her secular ideals are more relevant now.
“The secular ideals of Indira Gandhi are more important in present day India when communalism is spreading its wings in the country. Indira Gandhi used to treat the minority community as her own children,” State Panchayat Minister and senior TMC leader Subrata Mukherjee said.
Mukherjee, during his days as Youth Congress leader has worked with Indira Gandhi in the 1970s.
“She used to say that if one of my sons is weak then I need to take more care of that son. And if for taking care of that son who is weak, if someone is angry with me, I am not bothered. This was her thinking about the minorities,” he said addressing the 97th birth anniversary celebrations of Indira Gandhi organised by Kolkata Municipal Corporation.
Mukherjee’s comments come days after Banerjee attended Jawaharlal Nehru’s 125th birth anniversary celebrations organised by Congress.

BSF intercepts Pakistan boat at Sir Creek  suspected people on boardfledPrint

At least five years after the illegal intrusions stopped from Pakistan in Harami Nala and Sir Creek at Gujarat-Pakistan border, the BSF (Border Security Force) intercepted a Pakistani boat at Sir Creek on Wednesday.
The boat was found coming close to the Indian waters at the Sir Creek that alerted the Creek Commandos of the force who are right now engaged in the search operations at the spot.
A senior officer from the BSF Operations said, “The boat was intercepted at Sir Creek however a few metres away before it could fully enter into the creek that is supervised by the Gujarat Frontier. When the boat was intercepted, it was found empty. It was checked thoroughly and nothing was found inside it. We suspect that the fishermen or those who were on board fled but we cannot say that they were indeed fishermen since no fish stock was found inside the boat”.
The BSF officials said the boat is 30 to 40 feet long and comparatively smaller to the fishing boats that come from the Pakistani waters. The BSF commandos have however undertaken a search operation from at the Sir Creek and nearby creek areas after this incident.
However since the crew members are missing, the BSF has alerted the State Police, Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard to increase their vigilance. It is also suspected that the crew members might have entered from the Creek and left the boat to mislead the BSF.
The sources in BSF added that the boat was seen coming at around 12:30am by the BSF commandos who boarded their boat to apprehend the Pakistani boat. After keeping a close watch for about an hour, the empty boat was found floating in water at Sir Creek. This act raised the suspicion of the BSF that the crew members were unlike the fishermen who go astray in Indian waters and are caught within minutes of their touching the Indian maritime zone.
The Creek Crocodiles, a commando force of the BSF was raised in 2009 to patrol Harami Nala and Sir Creek as a part of their water wing operations. The intrusions from Pakistan that were observed in high numbers had dropped to the nil, as per the records of the BSF accessed last.
The BSF suspects that the crew members of the boat fled sensing the movement of the BSF or they left the boat near the Indian waters giving a signal of possible intrusion in coming days. The intelligence wing of the BSF was however alerted from last one month about Pakistani intrusion from the border areas in Kutch through land or marshy water areas of the creeks between Kutch and Pakistan.
Similarly, the Indian Coast Guard had apprehended a Pakistani boat off Jamnagar coast and arrested six fishermen in October. The Pakistani boat ‘Al-Rahimo’ had left from Karachi on October 1 and was found near the Indian maritime border. The boat was carrying 150 kilograms of fish. The ICG had observed that the fishermen had caught this huge quantity of fish within continued…

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday left for home after concluding his 10-day three nation tour during which he attended the East Asia and ASEAN-India Summits in Myanmar, the G-20 Summit in Australia and held bilaterals with his Australian and Fijian counterparts. Modi, the first Indian premier to visit the Pacific country after Indira Gandhi who had come to Fiji in 1981, left its capital Suva on a special Indian Air Force plane.
He held talks with his Fijian counterpart Frank Bainimarama and also announced a slew of Lines of Credit and development aid totalling USD 80 million for the country. Modi also announced USD one million Special Adaptation Fund for the Pacific nations and a proposal to develop Pan Pacific Islands Project for tele-medicine and tele-education. He also addressed Fijian parliament, the first by a foreign leader, after parliamentary elections, during which he said that India was prepared to build a “Digital Fiji”.
Noting the inconvenience in travel due to Visa issues, Modi announced visa on arrival facility for all the 14 Pacific Island countries and hoped that it will facilitate exchanges and promote better understanding between the peoples.
During his four-city tour in Australia, Modi and his counterpart Tony Abbott agreed on a landmark framework for security cooperation across the spectrum in defence, cyber and maritime security and combating terrorism, including the threats posed by foreign fighters joining extremists groups.
Modi, the first prime minister to visit Australia in 28 years, also addressed the Australian Parliament. The two countries also decided to conclude a long-pending Free Trade pact by the end of next year and an “early closure” of the civilian nuclear deal that will facilitate uranium imports to India. Prior to arriving in Australia, Modi attended the ASEAN-India summit and the East Asia Summit in Myanmar.
At the East Asia summit in Myanmar capital Nay Pyi Taw, Modi asserted that the world community must reject any linkage between religion and terrorism while formulating a “genuinely international” partnership in the fight against all forms of terror acts. On India-ASEAN relationship, Modi said there were “no irritants” in their ties and they can be “great” partners.
He said there will be “major improvement” in India’s trade policy and environment and proposed a special facility for speedy implementation of connectivity projects with the 10-nation ASEAN bloc. On the sidelines of the summits, Modi met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak, Russian Premier Dmitry Medvedev, and Thai counterpart Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha.

D.C. area forecast: Freezing cold today with less wind; slow warming in sightA somewhat subjective rating of the day’s weather, on a scale of 0 to 10.
4
Less wind makes the chill more tolerable. Still bitter compared to the usual November fare.
Express Forecast
Today: Partly to mostly sunny, less windy. Highs: Mid-30s.
Tonight: Partly to mostly cloudy. Lows: Mid-20s to low 30s.
Tomorrow: Partly to mostly sunny, not as cold. Highs: Mid-40s.
FORECAST IN DETAIL
Yesterday was the coldest Nov. 18 in D.C. since 1959 . Today promises a similar chill in the temperature department, though at least the wind isn’t as bad. A gradual warm-up is in store, but it gets off to a herky-jerky start with highs in the 40s on Thursday and back down to near or below 40 Friday, before a more consistent warming trend takes hold this weekend. By Sunday we’re in the 50s with a risk of rain.
Temperature Map
Temperatures: Latest D.C. area temperature map. See interactive map on our Weather Wall .
Today (Wednesday): The wind is less punishing today, but temperatures are almost just as cold as yesterday, perhaps a couple degrees warmer. From morning lows in the teens and 20s, afternoon highs only manage the mid-30s under partly to mostly sunny skies, with winds from the south-southwest near 10 mph. That’s still enough of a breeze to keep wind chills in the 20s through much of the day. Confidence : High
As we covered in yesterday’s PM Updat e, the record low maximum temperatures for today are 33 in D.C. (from 1880), 38 at Dulles (from 2008), and 35 at BWI (from 1880). Note that the 33 in D.C. in 1880 was observed at 24th St. and M St., the official reporting station before the switch to National Airport in 1942.
Tonight: Skies turn partly to mostly cloudy, which is good news if last night was too darn cold for you. The insulating effect of the clouds keeps temperatures from totally tanking, as lows range mainly from the mid-20s to low 30s. Confidence: High
For related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock . Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend…
Tomorrow (Thursday): Our gradual warm-up, uneven as it may be, begins in earnest on Thursday. As the chilly air mass starts to moderate, highs rise into the mid-40s, helped by partly to mostly sunny skies. Winds are breezy at times, from the west-southwest at around 10-15 mph. Confidence: High
Tomorrow night: The initial warming trend takes a hit as a reinforcing shot of cold air sends temperatures tumbling once again. Lows dip down to the 20s area-wide with mostly clear skies above. Confidence: Medium-High

A LOOK AHEAD
After Thursday’s one step forward in the warmer direction, we step back colder on Friday with highs only reaching the upper 30s to near 40. We’ll have just enough of a breeze to add an extra chill despite mostly sunny skies. Friday nights lows make a return visit to the 20s. Confidence: Medium-High
With high pressure in control, the weekend starts off with a mostly sunny Saturday, but still rather cool. Highs head for the mid-40s. As high pressure shifts to our east Friday night, we pick up a warmer flow from the south, which means milder lows in the 30s. Sunday sees the approach of rain from the southwest. Timing is still subject to change, but right now it looks like rain could arrive by afternoon as highs make a welcome return to the 50s. Confidence: Medium

Frenemies Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan made headlines when they recently hugged at Salman’s sister Arpita’s sangeet. Friends and family breathed a sigh of relief as it seemed like the duo finally let bygones be bygones and sorted out their differences.
But it didn’t stop there. We hear both Salman and Shah Rukh were so excited to be catching up after so long, that they decided to rope in their third pal, Aamir Khan as well.

Aamir Khan , who was in Delhi at that time, was being kept awake by the Khans who kept calling him and involving him in the get together via Facetime, so much so, that they did not let him sleep at all.
Picture of the two Khans kissing the bride-to-be Arpita were all over the social media.
Well, we hope there is some possibility of the three Khans working together in the near future.

Massive snowstorm hits US  all 50 states feel freezingcoldSeveral feet of lake-effect snow paralyzed the Buffalo area. (Source: AP photo)

A ferocious storm dumped massive piles of snow on parts of upstate New York, trapping residents in their homes and stranding motorists on roadways, as temperatures in all 50 U.S. states fell to freezing or below.
IN PICS: Massive snowstorm hits US, throws all 50 states out of gear
Even hardened Buffalo residents were caught off-guard Tuesday as more than 4 feet (1.2 meters) in parts of the city. Authorities said snow totals by Wednesday afternoon could top 6 feet (1.8 meters) in the hardest-hit areas south of Buffalo, with another storm expected Thursday.
Cold weather enveloped the entire country Tuesday, leading to record-low temperatures more familiar to January than November. Racing winds and icy roads caused accidents, school closings and delays in municipal operations from the Midwest to the South even where snowfall was low or mercifully absent.

In a region accustomed to highway-choking snowstorms, this one is being called one of the worst in memory. Snow blown by strong winds forced the closing of a 132-mile (212-kilometer) stretch of the main highway across New York state.
The storm was blamed for at least six deaths in New York, New Hampshire and Michigan.
“We have tried to get out of our house, and we are lucky to be able to shovel so we can open the door,” said Linda Oakley of Buffalo. “We’re just thinking that in case of an emergency we can at least get out the door. We can’t go any further.”
The snowstorm forced motorists in 150 vehicles, including a women’s basketball team, to ride out the onslaught in their vehicles. They waited for hours to be freed, with some waiting more than a day. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo deployed 150 members of the National Guard to help clear snow-clogged roads and remove abandoned vehicles.
By early Wednesday, a Thruway official said most but not all passenger vehicles had been cleared.
“It seemed like a nightmare. It just didn’t feel like it was going to end,” Bryce Foreback, 23, of Shicora, Pennsylvania, told The Associated Press by cellphone 20 hours into his wait for help. “I haven’t slept in like 30 hours and I’m just waiting to get out of here.”
Foreback had become stuck in a long line of cars just south of Buffalo about 10:30 Monday night.
Members of the Niagara University women’s basketball team were napping on and off 17 hours into their wait on Tuesday night. Some got so thirsty they drank melted snow, said Coach Kendra Faustin, who was traveling with her 1-year-old.
The lake-effect snow created a stark divide: In downtown Buffalo and north of the city, there was a mere dusting of continued…

Rajnikanth  Amitabh Bachchan and a slice of Gandhi thisIFFIThe 45th edition of the IFFI, which gets underway on Thursday, is all set to host a coming together of two celestial objects, Rajnikanth and Amitabh Bachchan, who have helped millions of Indian cinema lovers soar into orbit over decades.

On Thursday, if you are in Goa, you may just be in chance to collect some stardust.  The 45th edition of the IFFI, which gets underway on Thursday, is all set to host a coming together of two celestial objects, Rajnikanth and Amitabh Bachchan, who have helped millions of Indian cinema lovers soar into orbit over decades.
The duo, two supreme stars of a galaxy called Bollywood will attend the inauguration ceremony at the Syama Prasad Mookerjee indoor stadium on the outskirts of the state capital on November 20.
While Big B will be the chief guest at the event, the Nizam of the Southern cinema Rajnikanth will be present to accept the Centenary award for Indian Film personality of the year at a ceremony which will be attended attended Union ministers for Information and Broadcasting Arun Jaitley (cabinet) Rajyavardhan Rathore (state) and Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar, among others.
Bachchan’s entry this year is significant because the tenure of his absence from IFFI, India’s biggest state-backed film festival has coincided with his falling out with the Congress-led central governments in the recent past.
‘The President’ directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf will be the opening film of the fest, while “The Grandmaster” by Wong Kar-wai, who will incidentally receive the lifetime achievement award, will be the closing film.
The 11-day festival will also screen 179 films from 75 countries across different categories which include World Cinema (61 films), Masterstrokes (11 films), Festival Kaleidoscope (20 films), Soul of Asia (7 films), Documentaries (6 films), and Animated Films (6 films).
The Indian Panorama section will include 41 feature and non-feature films. Seven films from the India’s North-Eastern region will also be screened at the event, as part of a special package.
“In all sixty two films in the world cinema section will be screened, while 15 films will be screened in the IFFI’s competition section this year,” says Shankar Mohan, a senior official of the Union ministery for Information and Broadcasting, who is also Director of the IFFI.
Retrospective sections on Gulzar and Jahnu Baruah, special homage films on Richard Attenborough, Robin Williams, Zohra Sehgal, Suchitra Sen, and special tribute to Farooq Sheikh would be other attractions this year.
A special section of films that focus on dance, personality based retrospectives, and Masterclasses or specialized workshops conducted by master artistes will also form a part of IFFI 2014.
This positioning of China as a guest country at this year’s event is a result of cinematic partnership as envisioned in an India-China agreement signed continued…

Scents and sensibilitiescelebrity
Whether in cooking or in classical dance, Sushmita Ghosh is aware of a fragrant past
It is a weekday afternoon and New Delhi’s Connaught Place is relatively quiet. The expensive shops offer an inviting respite from the afternoon sun, which can still get overbearing. The eyes of the uniformed doormen-guards standing at every entrance follow passersby lazily and for the most part harmlessly. The paanwallah in the shaded arcade is relaxed. Business takes a meandering pace at this time, and the traffic is manageable.
That’s why there is space to scan the old buildings of CP’s outer circle for the sign of Chew Pan Asian Cafe. A relatively new restaurant (whose information-packed name gives us a reasonable idea of what to expect), it is located in M Block on the first floor. This is where I have arranged to meet Sushmita Ghosh, noted Kathak exponent and currently Director, Kathak Kendra, the national institute for Kathak. Sushmita, who learnt from Munna Shukla, Reba Vidyarthi and Tirath Ram Azad in Delhi, besides receiving guidance from Rohini Bhate of Pune, spent 12 years of her early career in England. While there, she worked with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and the Academy of Indian Dance and created training programmes for students learning South Asian dance. For over a decade now she has been back in India. Sushmita was directing the Aakriti Foundation, an organisation she founded while in England as “a platform to promote understanding and practice of Indian classical dance in its totality, and its interconnections with other art disciplines.” However, for the past 10 months approximately, she has been in the director’s seat at Kathak Kendra.
Sushmita, whose work in England included creating the first Kathak syllabus for the Imperial Society for Teachers of Dancing, is keenly interested in the ways in which the classical arts, rooted in the past, can best be transmitted in a changing India. Her students from places like Finland and England still visit her in India. “They’ve become part of the extended family,” she says. It’s commonplace now for eager learners from foreign countries to come to India in search of an understanding of its classical dances and the positives they impart to one’s life, but just as common for Indian parents to pull their children out of a dance class as soon as they enter class X.
As we talk — how to bridge the gap between ordinary city residents and the classical arts, how the new generation of performers approaches the classical arts, what are the responsibilities of taxpayer funded art institutions — our table finds itself loaded with colour.
A dish of prawns salt and pepper arrives on the chef’s recommendation, along with Thai crispy tossed vegetables. Then there is crispy lotus stem. The finely sliced, spicy, crackly yet soft lotus stems make a winner of a serving. Dim sums — crystal greens corn dumplings — complete the wholesome foursome. The food, its freshness palpable, is too good to be ignored for long, even if we are talking in distressed tones about how the general public’s mindset towards artists in general, and dancers in particular, needs to change. “It’s very good food,” agrees Sushmita.
As a soloist Sushmita has performed in many parts of India and the world. Now, though, with new responsibilities and many more students whose future is to be considered, her solos “hmmm...seem to have taken a back seat.” We wash down the fragrant dishes with green tea. Speaking of fragrances, it was through her sense of smell that Sushmita taught herself to cook, she recalls.
“The ‘niramish’ kitchen was devised in Bengal,” she explains. This was the kitchen reserved for widowed women in the family, who were supposed to eat lightly spiced food prepared in a secluded part of the house. The simple food became part of Bengali cuisine,” says Sushmita.
“I grew up with that fragrance, of the tadka (tempering), which we call phodon. It could be mustard, or methi (fenugreek). There is not so much jeera. When I went to England and started cooking, I would go by the scent. I would put one tadka and say, no, it doesn’t smell right. Then I would try another.” Bengali cuisine, she says, is “quite delicate and subtle.” Take sandesh, the milk sweet. “To me it feels a little more subtle than just milk. Of course I might be completely biased because I grew up with it,” she remarks.
“My father loved food. Also, I’ve travelled to so many places. Food is part of the culture. And when we take it out of the culture and place it somewhere else, I don’t know if that’s such a good idea,” she muses.
She cites the example of cheese, increasingly available in India. Cheese, she notes, was a product of cold terrains like Europe because of the large amounts of milk there and the climate. We don’t have excess milk here and we don't have so much cold....” Now there’s something for the globalisers to think about. But then, some imports are admittedly delicious. Like Chew’s Banofee Pie. A dish to soothe frayed nerves and instil hope in the hardiest cynic, it has the light creaminess of cheesecake, the firm pastry of a pie, the freshness of banana and the sweetness of toffee! Just the dessert to turn our next task — wading through CP’s rush hour crowds — into a cakewalk.

FTIL stock rises on pact to sell Mauritius-based bourseFTIL stock rises on pact to sell Mauritius-based bourse
BT Online Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 18, 2014  | 14:15 IST
The Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL) stock rose on Tuesday on the BSE after it said it has signed a pact to sell its Mauritius-based exchange for $40.5 million (about Rs 250 crore) to Continental Africa Holdings Ltd.
At 2:09 pm, the stock was trading 4 per cent higher at Rs 190.55.
FTIL decided to exit the exchange business and focus on its core technology business after the Rs 5,600 crore scam surfaced at its Indian subsidiary NSEL last year.
In a filing to the BSE, Jignesh Shah-led FTIL said the Board of its Mauritius-based subsidiary FT Group Investments Pvt Ltd has "approved the sale of 100 per cent of its stake in Bourse Africa Ltd, Mauritius to Continental Africa Holdings Ltd, Mauritius, for $40.5 million".
The Mauritius arm signed a definitive agreement with Continental Africa Holdings. The deal is subject to certain customary closing conditions. The entire transaction is expected to be completed within the next 210 days, it said.
Bourse Africa is an international multi-asset class exchange that offers trading on commodity derivatives, African and global currency derivatives.
In past few months, FTIL has exited from MCX and IEX. It has sold its entire 26 per cent stakes in the commodity bourse MCX for about Rs 900 crore and also sold nearly 26 per cent stake in IEX for Rs 576.84 crore.
Earlier this year, it had sold its stake in National Bulk Handling Corp for Rs 242 crore.
FTIL has been exiting the exchange business after commodity markets regulator FMC in December last year declared it to be unfit to run any exchanges in view of the NSEL payment crisis.

Companies must justify coal demand: GoyalCompanies must justify coal demand, says coal and power ministerPiyush Goyal
SPS Pannu     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 20, 2014  | 19:02 IST
Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal
Coal and power minister Piyush Goyal on Monday said that number of coal mines to be allocated through the next auction to any public sector or private company will be based on a scientific assessment of actual needs of power plants or steel units that are being set up.
Goyal told reporters that a committee will carefully study production plans of units that will be end users of coal and then decide the quantity that will be required to run them or steel making units over their lifespan.
Each company will have to justify its demand for coal mines based on the number of plants it is setting up.
Goyal also said that state power utilities will be allocated mines that are close to plants that are being set up.
The rationalisation of coal linkages is an important part of the government's policy to make the power and coal mining sectors more efficient.
Goyal pointed out that "it was silly" to transport coal in the railway network in two opposite directions because mines were not allocated to power plants set up in their vicinity.
He cited the example of how within a few days after coming to power the government had cleared the Gujarat electricity board proposal to swap its coal from domestic mines with NTPC's imported coal.
The proposal had been pending for several years with power plants in coastal Gujarat bringing in coal from the hinterland while NTPC was transporting coal from the Gujarat ports in the reverse direction.
Goyal said that his plan to double the output of Coal India Limited to 1 billion tonnes in the next five years is based on a welldevised strategy that would entail quickly bringing more mines into production as work had still not started in as many as 200 blocks.
Clearances will be expedited so that new mines come into production from which he expects an additional 200 million tonnes (MT) of coal.
Another 200 MT of coal is held up in mines because there is no railway infrastructure to carry it. With three new railway lines being laid, this output would become available, Goyal added.
The minister pointed out that Suresh Prabhu has been appointed as the rail minister to expedite these projects and streamline the network as he has already served as the chairman of the advisory group for the integrated development of the power, coal and renewable energy sectors with the goal to ensure 24x7 electricity supply.
Prabhu has got a deep insight into the transport bottleneck holding back the coal and power sectors and is the right person to speed up plans for streamlining the system, Goyal added.
The minister also disclosed bigger plans for NTPC . He wants to transform the public sector power major into an end-to-end company that will produce enough coal to meet its own demand and also power distribution.

Buttons that pop out over touch displaysMicah Yairi, CTO, Tactus Technology. He was working on ways to deliver drugs through the skin using microfluidics.
Tactus Technology
Touch keyboards are almost impossible to navigate blind, but not our physical keyboards. The reason is the tactile feedback our fingers get from the raised qwerty keys. Tactus Technology, a California-based company, has been working on buttons that physically morph out and then flatten back from a thin panel that can be placed over touchscreens. The company traces back to research work on drug delivery systems through the skin, using microfluidics, a technology applied in inkjet printers and LCD screens.
Backstory
California, 2007. Apple has launched the iPhone and Craig Ciesla has bought one. But he doesn't quite bask in the afterglow of the unboxed product. In an online video, Ciesla says that he still likes his BlackBerry for its physical, tactile buttons. Ciesla, a fibre optics specialist, who has been involved in product development, is also bandying business ideas with his friend and colleague, Micah Yairi, who was then working on drug delivery systems. Yairi may have told Ciesla about a journal article he published that year. It was about a pump that could control microfluidic channels to generate high pressure (eh? we'll unpack that next up). The paper abstract says it could find applications in systems ranging from drug delivery, to cooling microchips to filtration. Yairi may not have initially thought of it, but creating a morphable surface that sits over a touchscreen interface could perhaps be yet another.
How It Works
Let's back out a bit. Microfluidics is fluid physics at extremely small scales - below a millionth of a litre. Just as the integrated circuit put discrete components onto a chip, automation of fluid micro-channel networks could allow a biology or chemistry lab on a chip. This is like plumbing - with pumps and valves that allow an assembly line for fluid manipulation - at a miniaturised scale.
But fluid physics changes dramatically as the scale changes, unlike microelectronics where transistors have become smaller and smaller, to the point of single-electron transistors with the same physics, as one review article from Caltech researchers in 2005 points out. Still, as a system, what's important is that the flow of the fluid be controlled like it's important to control the flow of electrons and the current in logic circuits.
One way to control the flow of microfluidic channels is by a method called induced charge electro-osmosis, basically controlling fluid flow through voltages. This is where Yairi's paper comes in. He made a pump to increase flow rate and pressure in over half a million fluid channels using this property.
In the Tactus system, an actuator on the side controls the microfluidic flow through a voltage differential. Once the fluid is flowing, you can have pressure being applied at specific points on a deformable surface. That surface can be manipulated to deform into buttons and revert back to the flat surface once the fluid pressure is off. Tactus seems to have eventually got this down pat - it takes a second or so for the buttons to pop out and to merge into the surface.
Breaking Out
Tactus received $6 million in funding from Thomvest Ventures in late 2011. It has been a regular at the consumer electronics show to mostly positive reviews, and has reportedly showcased a prototype overlay for the iPad mini. Last year, the company reportedly worked on prototypes with Synaptics, the ubiquitous touchpad company. This year, it has announced a manufacturing partnership with Taiwan-based manufacturer Wistron, and Japan-based electronics supplier Ryoyo.
Platform Pitch
Automakers are apparently interested in the Tactus product from a safety point of view - for their dash panels. A tactile response prevents drivers from having to look at the panel and being distracted from the road.
Once you have a morphable surface, it is possible to have modes where different buttons pop out, say, for gaming and on-the-go-music. Tactus seems to have filed a patent for the programming logic of such a system.
Still, making the buttons grippy enough and having a clear surface panel at the same time may not be so easy.
To show why tactile is better, the company refers to a 2002 study done by Sony researchers on its website that shows speeds of scrolling for tactile feedback. The small but widely cited study found that users preferred the tactile response not so much for functional reasons, but because of better user experience. That might be key for Tactus.

Full force of the law must come down on Meiyappan: GavaskarGavaskar was in Australia at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend a special reception at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was hosted by Australian PM Tony Abbot. (Source: BCCI)

Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has hit out at Gurunath Meiyappan, son-in-law of ICC President N Srinivasan, over his involvement in betting and also questioned the Tamil Nadu strongman’s silence in the whole spot-fixing and betting issue.
“The full force of the law must come down on Meiyappan,” Gavaskar said while speaking to the ‘India Today Group’ in Melbourne.
Gavaskar said Srinivasan needs to explain why he did not act against players if he knew they were involved in fixing.”There are reports which say the Mudgal committee report has found that Srinivasan knew about betting but did not do anything about it. Srinivasan should answer for why he did not act if he knew that a player was guilty,” Gavaskar said.
Gavaskar was in Australia at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend a special reception at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was hosted by Australian PM Tony Abbot.
Several Indian and Australian cricketing legends such as Kapil Dev, VVS Laxman, Steve Waugh, Glenn McGrath, Allan Border, Jason Gillespie also attended the reception.
Gavaskar said that there should be zero tolerance against match-fixing and betting and if any player is found guilty of having participated in wrong acts then he should be jailed and his entire cricketing history deleted from the record books.
Gavaskar said, “New Zealand has come up with a new law on betting which says that guilty players will be jailed. India should have the same law.”
The former captain also suggested that the government should think about legalising betting in India”A lot of betting happens through black money. But if you open official betting shop, Government will be able to increase its revenues. It’s like prohibition, if someone wants to bet illegally, they will. Government should think about legalising betting,” said Gavaskar.
The cricket legend sought to draw a distinction between team owners who were found guilty of betting and players, saying that players should not be punished till the time it can be established that the owner of the team influenced the
player.
Speaking about the forthcoming India’s tour of Australia, Gavaskar said that he felt that the Indian team would face a very tough time.
“Indian players will need to be patient. They will need to keep extravagant shots in their pockets when they play in Australia. This is not T20 or One-day Internationals. Australian pitches are the best to bat on but the players have to be patient.”
Meanwhile, Gavaskar also shared some lighter moments with Prime Minister Modi while the World Cup and Border-Gavaskar trophies were being displayed for the two PMs of the two countries.
“When the photo opportunity was on, I saw Modi was holding the World Cup trophy. Abbot held the Border-Gavaskar trophy. I told the PM that you are holding the right trophy. This is the continued…

The Indian rupee on Monday closed almost flat at 61.73 against the greenback on alternate bouts of demand and supply amid rise in dollar value overseas.
While the marginal drop in rupee was its third straight session of decline, the local currency seemed to hold steady compared to Asian peers, who saw volatility after data showed Japan slipping into recession, said forex experts.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced strong at 61.63 a dollar from previous close of 61.72, but later declined to a low of 61.7875 before settling at 61.73, showing a fall of a mere one paisa or 0.02 per cent.
The dollar was trading strong in overseas market as the dollar index was up by 0.13 per cent against its major six global rivals.

Terry Walsh resigns  but says  there may be a way forwardPrint

The six-member committee, constituted by Sports Authority of India (SAI) to study the proposals of Indian hockey coach Terry Walsh, met the Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.
In a major setback for Indian hockey, the men’s national team chief coach Terry Walsh today officially quit from his post after his contractual talks with Hockey India and the SAI broke down but a fresh proposal is still being worked out for the Australian’s consideration.
“Mr Terry Walsh had a meeting with the Honourable Sports Minister today along with the committee at 14:30 hours. The minister applauded Mr Terry Walsh’s recent performance and believed that Mr Walsh is the right man to take Indian Hockey forward,” said Setia in a statement.
“The committee comprising of former Indian hockey players Ajit Pal Singh, Ashok Kumar, Zafar Iqbal, High Performance Director Rolant Oltmans, SAI’s Executive Director (Teams) Sudhir Setia and Hockey India CEO Elena Norman decided to meet the Sports Minister after two days of meeting.
“The minister patiently listened to Mr Walsh’s proposals and have agreed to all of them in principles and have asked the committee to find more details.However, Mr. Walsh stated that he needs few days off to go back to Australia. He will then have a re look at all the proposals offered in a positive manner towards renewal of his contract.” Setia said.
Walsh, whose contract was to come to an end tomorrow, had already submitted his resignation last month after his demands for a greater say in team decisions and hand-picked support staff were turned down by HI and Sports Authority of India.
Besides Walsh, a six-member committee, constituted by SAI to study Walsh’s proposals, also met Sports Minister today.
Walsh, on his part said he would be looking into the new proposal.
“There has been a proposal, which I am waiting to see.
When the document comes I will look at it but I am going to take a couple of days away from the program which is really difficult to do at this stage. But I believe if I don’t do that I am not going to be of any use to anybody because all these which is going on has been quite difficult.
“I would be very surprised if it’s later than this weekend. It won’t be later than this weekend,” Walsh said.
Walsh made it clear that his differences were with Hockey India rather than SAI as earlier perceived.
“We have reached an impasse in proceedings regarding my involvement with the program but there may be a way forward. This must be finalised between Hockey India and myself.”
Walsh completely denied that the alleged financial irregularities when he was associated with USA Hockey as pointed by HI president Narinder Batra was the reason for the deadlock.

Luis Garcia heads Atletico de Kolkata to victory over North East United FCPrint

Luis Garcia fired in a stunning header in the second-half to help Atletico de Kolkata end their four-match winless run by registering a 1-0 win over NorthEast United FC in their return leg ISL fixture at the Vivekananda Yuva Bharati Krirangan.
Garcia struck in the 51st minute, beating the towering Spanish World Cup winner Joan Capdevilla in the middle and the win helped ATK go three points clear of Chennaiyin FC in the lead position.
It was Borja Fernandez who brilliantly intercepted the ball and passed it on to Jofre Mateu whose measured cross from the left set up Garcia for the matchwinner.
Atletico now have 16 points from nine matches. They have four away and one home game left.
The scoreline could easily have been 2-0 but sub Arnal Llibert squandered an easy opportunity after being set up by Sanju Pradhan in front of an open net.
If NEUFC were brilliant with their defence, they were equally pathetic with their attack with the Indian duo of Durga Boro and Alen Deory wasting chances which derailed their recovery plans.
NEUFC had the best chance in the 83rd minute when Alen put in a great ball inside the six-yard box but an unmarked Seimeinlen Doungel wasted the free header only to put the ball over the bar.
Earlier, NEUFC made two changes to their starting line-up bringing in Massamba Lo Sambou in the central midfield and Durga Boro up front in place of Len Doungel and James Keene.
ATK, on the other hand, replaced Biswajit Saha with N Mohanraj in the backline in the only change to their line-up.
The first-half was full of intensity as both NEUFC and ATK went hammer and tongs to go one up.
ATK were sharp with their attack but it was the visitors’ Spanish World Cup winner Capdevilla who stood in their way.
NEUFC, on the other hand, had better ball possession and got as many as five corners in the first-half but with an innocuous attack in the Indian duo of Alen Deory and Durga Boro, the Guwahati franchise cut a sorry figure.
Garcia had an inspiring surge in the sixth minute but he was a tad faster than his striking partner as ATK took some time to settle down.
ATK’s first real opening came in the 11th minute when NEUFC goalkeeper TP Rehenesh brought down Fikru on the edge of the box in the right flank but the defence proved too strong once again.
The home side once again had a taste of NEUFC’s strong defence when Garcia’s powerful rightfooter from the edge of the box was blocked brilliantly by Capdevila in a 29th minute.

Vishwanathan Anand  Magnus Carlsen play out another draw in game 8By: Press Trust of India | Sochi | Posted: November 19, 2014 12:32 am
Challenger Viswanathan Anand did not get much out of his prepared variation and had to settle for a draw in the eighth round to remain a point behind in the World Chess Championship match against Magnus Carlsen.
Carlsen, not known for preparation, again matched Anand move for move like the last game and had nothing to worry about as the Indian’s white pieces were neutralised move for move.
The match seems to have tilted in favour of Carlsen post this game as Anand could not produce anything decisive in terms of opening preparation.
As the game started it was clear that Carlsen and his team was happy to get an equal position out of the opening, and while Anand spent too much time on the first few moves, it was clear that the task given to team Carlsen was performed pretty nicely.
The Indian king tried and did not succeed in finding the path to execute some pressure on the Norwegian giant. The end result was a draw.
For the records, Anand went for the principled variation in the Queens gambit declined but having his long term second and friend, Peter Heine Nielsen, on the other side did not help his cause.
It was surprising to see Anand thinking for long as simply, Carlsen seemed better prepared in the opening. The middle game that arrived was about equal when many of the top Grandmasters were predicting a drawn result on the social network.
Anand, from his end, did his best but it was not enough as the final result justified.
“It was a nice middle game and a decent advantage in the endgame, but it was never close to being winning,” said
Grandmaster Abhijeet Gupta who had been watching the game right from the word go.
Indian Grandmaster Sahaj Grover had a different take on the game as he said, “Anand should have pressed harder for the win in this eighth game.”
“I guess Anand needed to do better, it was clear that Carlsen had to come back to his best opening today and the Queen gambit declined was no exception. If Anand could not find a fault in Carlsen’s stars today then he might find it difficult in the course of the match,” he said.
In the post-match conference, Anand gave nothing away which could mean that the Indian might be plotting a way to disrupt Carlsen’s plans.

Israel vows harsh response to synagogue attackIsrael vowed harsh retaliation Tuesday for a Palestinian attack that killed five people.
By: Associated Press | Jerusalem | Posted: November 19, 2014 5:13 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 4:02 pm
Israel vowed harsh retaliation Tuesday for a Palestinian attack that killed five people and left blood-smeared prayer books and shawls on the floor of a synagogue in Jerusalem – an assault that sharply escalated already-high tensions after weeks of religious violence.
The attack during morning prayers in the west Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof was carried out by two Palestinian cousins wielding meat cleavers, knives and a handgun. They were shot to death by police after the deadliest assault in the holy city since 2008.
Four of the dead were rabbis and one was a police officer who died of his wounds hours after the attack. Three of the rabbis were born in the United States and the fourth was born in England, although all held dual Israeli citizenship. Five others were wounded.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack, the first time he has done so in the wave of deadly violence against Israelis. But he also called for an end to Israeli “provocations” surrounding Jerusalem’s shrines that are sacred to both Muslims and Jews.
President Barack Obama called the attack “horrific” and without justification, urging cooperation from both sides to ease tensions and adding that too many Israelis and Palestinians have died in recent months,
Tuesday’s attack, however, appeared to mark a turning point, with the gruesome scene in a house of worship shocking a nation long accustomed to violence.
The government released a photo of a meat cleaver it said came from the crime scene. Government video showed blood-soaked prayer books and prayer shawls in the synagogue. A pair of glasses lay under a table, and thick streaks of blood smeared the floor.
“I saw people lying on the floor, blood everywhere,” said Yosef Posternak, who was at the synagogue in the quiet neighborhood that has a large community of English-speaking immigrants.
“People were trying to fight with (the attackers) but they didn’t have much of a chance,” Posternak told Israel Radio.
In one of Israel’s first acts of retaliation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the demolitions of the homes of the attackers. But halting further violence could prove to be a tough challenge as police confront a new threat: Lightly armed assailants from annexed east Jerusalem who hold residency rights that allow them to move freely throughout the country.
Netanyahu condemned the deaths of the “innocent and pure Jews.” In a nationally televised address, he accused Abbas of inciting the recent violence and said the Palestinian leader’s condemnation of the attack was insufficient.
Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs the Gaza Strip, praised the attack. In Gaza, dozens celebrated in the streets, with some offering trays full of candy.
The U.S.-born victims were identified as Moshe Twersky, 59, Aryeh Kupinsky, 43, and Kalman Levine, 55. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the British man was Avraham Goldberg, 68, who immigrated to Israel continued…

Landrieus final indignity: One vote shy on KeystoneBy Aaron Blake November 18 Follow @aaronblakewp

Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) has participated in a keg stand . She has run this desperate ad . She lost an energy committee chairmanship that she often touted, when the GOP took the Senate on Nov. 4. She has clashed -- in front of reporters -- with a leader of her party . That same party basically abandoned her in her runoff campaign for a fourth term.
But on Tuesday, she suffered the biggest indignity of her 2014 campaign, and possibly of her political career.
Landrieu, reduced to a relatively pointless gambit to demonstrate her clout in Washington, failed to secure the 60 votes required to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. She came up one vote shy .
This was basically Landrieu's final play. With no party funding for her campaign, she has been drubbed on the airwaves -- as in, exponentially so. And even before that, few gave her much hope in her runoff with Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.).
So in a last-ditch effort to move the needle, she launched the Keystone campaign. Nevermind that the very same bill will probably pass with ease once Republicans take control of the Senate in January. She wanted to prove she could make it happen two months earlier -- because why not.
And Senate Democrats -- who, again, have abandoned her financially -- have now abandoned her in spirit too. The vote wasn't just meaningless because Republicans will pass the bill come next year; it was also meaningless because the White House has basically said it would veto the bill, as the State Department is still reviewing the project.
And despite all of it -- despite the whole dog-and-pony show of the past week -- Democrats couldn't even give Landrieu enough votes to breathe a little life (hypothetically, at least) into her long-shot campaign.
Bloomberg declared last week that Democrats had left " a body on the campaign trail ."
On Tuesday, with Landrieu's assistance, they metaphorically ran over the body with a truck.
And Landrieu, a three-term senator and member of a royal political family from Louisiana, just proved precisely how little clout -- or hope -- she has.
In a tight vote, the Senate rejected the Keystone XL pipeline Tuesday evening, dealing a serious blow to the re-election efforts of Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.). (AP)

AK-47 rifle wielding man tries to kidnap top Aurobindo Pharma official in HyderabadDelhi cab rape case: What Uber, others say and what they deliver
An AK-47 rifle wielding man allegedly tried to abduct Aurobindo Pharma’s Director K Nityananda Reddy from his car near a park and opened fire when Reddy and his brother resisted in the posh Banjara Hills this morning.
No one was injured in the incident that spread panic in the upscale area. Police said the attacker fled leaving behind his weapon.
“One person tried to kidnap him (Reddy). However, he resisted his attempt. Following this, the person fired in air and also at his car. Three rounds were fired in the process before he fled the scene,” Assistant Commissioner of Police, Banjara Hills, Uday Kumar Reddy said.
According to an eyewitness, the unidentified attacker sat in Reddy’s car and then threatened him with an AK-47 rifle. However, Reddy’s brother, who was sitting in the car’s rear seat, tried to resist the attacker’s attempt. In the scuffle, the attacker fired some rounds at the car’s windshield.
Later, the weapon was seized from the car, police said.
Reddy, who is Vice Chairman of Aurobindo Pharma, said after finishing his morning walk at KBR Park here, he sat in his car and was about to start it when the attack took place.
“Suddenly this man came and threatened me with the gun. I tried to catch hold of the weapon and also shouted for help and my brother tried to catch him. The person fired some rounds at my car before fleeing,” Reddy told reporters after the incident.
Police recovered a few empty shells from the site. Sniffer and tracking dogs were pressed into action to nab the attacker.

Chris Hemsworth named Peoples Sexiest Man AliveJimmy Kimmel makes the big announcement about Chris Hemsworth (ABC)
Chris Hemsworth?!
No offense to Mr. Thor, but…huh? The  31-year-old Australian actor (as handsome as he may be) wasn’t on anyone’s prediction list for People magazine’s coveted Sexiest Man Alive cover this year. And yet, he was awarded the honor Tuesday night on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”
After a guessing game in which the audience tried to figure out the guy’s identity (under 35, played a superhero in a movie, had a famous brother), Hemsworth was finally revealed. Streaming in via Skype from Australia, Hemsworth sat on a couch as someone off-camera handed him a giant trophy with a mirror attached.
For those who think the name sounds familiar but aren’t exactly sure who he might be, we’ll clear it up. No, it’s not the guy from “The Hunger Games” who was once engaged to Miley Cyrus: That’s his younger brother, Liam. Chris is the one who starred in “Thor” and reprised his role  in “The Avengers.” (There’s a third Hemsworth, Luke, but no one really knows about him.)
Chris also has two new movies (Ron Howard’s “In the Heart of the Sea” and Michael Mann’s “Blackhat”) coming out next year, plus the “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” A slew of upcoming projects — in addition to gamely sitting for a cover photo shoot and interview — are all key parts of being named People’s Sexiest Man.
It also helps that Hemsworth actually seems cool. “What does it feel like to be the Sexiest Man Alive?” Kimmel asked.
“I’m most excited about the ‘alive’ portion of that statement,” Hemsworth deadpanned. “And the ‘sexy’ is a bonus, and I’m excited.”
Kimmel asked what younger bro Liam has to say about all of this.
“Liam’s good. We’ve been throwing sexy looks back and forth all week and kind of work-shopping…he’s been a real team player for this one,” Hemsworth assured him.
Anyone he would like to thank for the honor?
“My parents, I guess, for putting this together,” Hemsworth said, gesturing to his face, a strand of blonde hair artfully falling over his eye.
“Yes, I think we’re all very grateful,” Kimmel confirmed, as the camera cut back to Hemsworth admiring his own reflection in his mirror trophy.
For the second consecutive year , People didn’t name a bachelor — Hemsworth is married to model Elsa Pataky. The couple has three adorable kids, a two-year-old daughter and eight-month-old twin sons.
So that means that Chris Pratt — who many thought would be the front-runner — will just be GQ’s Man of the Year . And Neil Patrick Harris will just have to settle for hosting the Oscars.

The Indian rupee extended its losses for the fifth session in a row and ended at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96 against the Greenback on Wednesday following sustained dollar demand from oil importers and weakness in local stock market.
Slowdown in inflows also weighed on rupee that ended 22 paise lower while the dollar index was trading almost stable against its six major global rivals ahead of the release of the minutes of a key US Federal Reserve meeting.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the local currency commenced lower at 61.80 a dollar from previous close of 61.74 and immediately touched a high of 61.7850.
However, dollar demand pulled down the rupee as it fell back sharply to a low of 61.9950. It settled at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96, logging a drop of 22 paise or 0.36 per cent. This was its weakest closing since finishing at 62.04 on March 3, 2014. It had also logged intra-day low of 62.15 on March 4, 2014. Crude oil prices had fallen in the initial half of the day and prompted oil companies to speed up their greenback purchases also hurt sentiments.
Furthermore, a fall in local stocks triggered concerns of foreign fund outflows that also weighed on rupee, said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India. The rupee has weakened by 45 paise in five straight days.
In the stock market, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex tumbled by 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, after touching intra-day all-time peak of 28,294.01. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $2.44 million on Tuesday, as per Sebi data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group, said: Trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40.

Kiss of Love campaign likely to hit Bangalore after Kochi  DelhiPrint
By: Express News Service | Bangalore | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:08 pm
After Kochi and Delhi the liberal Kiss of Love campaign – involving the public display of affection – which has raised the hackles of conservatives is scheduled to hit Bangalore over the next weekend with a human rights activist Rachita Taneja set to organize an event if granted clearances by the police and the Congress government in Karnataka.
With right wing leaders like Sri Rama Sene chief Pramod Muttalik already threatening to disrupt any event involving kissing in public the Karnataka government is approaching the issue with caution.
Home minister K J George said on Tuesday that the government would permit the event to be held if it falls within the purview of laws concerning public decency. A former woman Congress minister C Motamma however cautioned the government against allowing the event.
Bangalore police commissioner M N Reddi told The Indian Express on Tuesday that no one had approached the police as yet for permission for the conduct of the Kiss of Love event in Bangalore.
Last week Sri Rama Sene leader Pramod Muttalik had threatened action on Kiss of Love events if organized in Karnataka. He had stated that kissing in public is against Indian culture and that it should be a private affair.
The human rights activists Rachita Taneja is proposing holding the event on November 29 and has a scheduled meeting with police officials on Wednesday. The activist said that she would not like to hold the event if security and safety were to be compromised.

England captain Wayne Rooney scored twice after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain headed the opener in a 3-1 win over Scotland as the visitors dominated a typically passionate Auld Enemy friendly at Celtic Park on Tuesday.
Rooney took his tally to 46 in his 101st international to move within three goals of Bobby Charlton’s England scoring record of 49 and led by example as skipper with his composed side proved too strong for the hosts.
Roy Hodgson’s men led 2-0 with seven minutes to play but Scotland came back when Andrew Robertson planted a left-foot shot past former Celtic keeper Fraser Forster to make it 2-1.
But two minutes later Rooney finished off a well-worked move involving substitutes Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert by turning the ball into the net from close range before leaping into an acrobatic celebration.
Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring when he glanced the ball home with his head after a superb pass from his Arsenal team mate Jack Wilshere to score after 32 minutes, reward for England taking control after a frenetic opening to the game.
Rooney headed England 2-0 in front in the 47th minute after Scotland failed to clear a free-kick.
The home side pulled a goal back when Robertson beat Forster at his near post before Rooney wrapped up the victory from close range after a superb swift-passing move down the right.
The home side, who have improved since Gordon Strachan became manager early last year, only had one real goal chance before scoring when Russell Martin forced Forster to palm the ball over the bar early in the second half.
RAUCOUS ATMOSPHERE
There was a raucous atmosphere generated by both sets of supporters in the immediate build-up to the kickoff in front of a near-capacity 60,000 crowd.
The tensions between the two not-always friendly neighbours might have been exacerbated away from the pitch by the recent Scottish independence referendum in which Scots voted 55-45 percent to preserve the 307-year-old union with England.
But apart from the obvious booing of the national anthems most of the derision was directed at the two sets of players.
The opening 20 minutes were predictably frenetic without much shape or substance but England gradually began to look the more assured side with Wilshere in the middle and Nathaniel Clyne on the right causing the home side problems.
It was the first match between the two neighbours, who until 1989 met annually, on Scottish soil since 1999 and England have now won seven of their last nine meetings with the Scots.

Oil falls to $78 as mkt awaits OPEC meet outcomeOil falls to $78 as mkt awaits OPEC meet outcome
Christopher Johnson     London   Last Updated: November 19, 2014  | 16:39 IST
Brent crude oil slipped towards $78 a barrel on Wednesday as data showed Saudi Arabia increased crude exports in September despite signs of an oversupplied market and producers appeared divided ahead of an OPEC meeting to discuss output.
All eyes are on OPEC's response to a drop in oil prices of nearly one-third in recent months, with some smaller members calling for production cuts at the November 27 meeting in Vienna.
OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia has so far shown no indication that it will support a reduction in OPEC production.
Diplomatic and market sources say Saudi officials said in recent private briefings that the kingdom could live for some time with current, or even lower, price levels.
Even seasoned OPEC veterans say they do not know how the cartel will respond to the collapse in oil prices this year.
"For the first time, I really do not know what is likely to happen at the meeting. It is not clear," one long-serving senior OPEC delegate told Reuters.
Brent was down 10 cents at $78.37 a barrel at 0815 GMT, after settling 84 cents lower in the previous session.
US crude was down 60 cents at $74.01 a barrel. The US crude futures contract closed $1.03 lower on Tuesday.
"It is a guessing game," said Carsten Fritsch, senior oil and commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
"There are so many opinions and views on what OPEC will do next week. The most reasonable response for investors is to stay on the sidelines and wait for guidance," Fritsch added.
Saudi Arabia increased crude oil exports in September by around 59,000 barrels per day (bpd), official data showed.
Oil prices fell on Tuesday after data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose 3.7 million barrels in the week ending November 14, including a 1.4-million-barrel build at the Cushing oil hub.
A closely watched report from the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) was due at 1530 GMT on Wednesday. A Reuters poll of seven analysts forecast crude stocks fell 800,000 barrels last week.
Unseasonably cold weather in the United States could boost demand for heating oil, with temperatures in all 50 states dipping to freezing or below on Tuesday.

Five Thai university students were detained Wednesday after giving a three-fingered salute inspired by “The Hunger Games” to the army-backed prime minister in a daring protest against the country’s military government.
The students, wearing T-shirts saying, “Don’t Want a Coup,” stood up with their backs to Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha while he spoke on a stage in Khon Kaen, a city in the northeast, an area that is a stronghold of former Premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup.
They raised three fingers above their heads, a symbol of resistance inspired by the book trilogy and Hollywood blockbuster, before police escorted them out. The five men from Khon Kaen University were taken to a police station and then an army camp, where they questioned by soldiers, human rights lawyer Sasinan Thamnithinan said. She said they have not been charged.
Thai protesters used the salute immediately after the May 22 coup, but have mostly stopped amid police crackdowns on demonstrations.
In “The Hunger Games,” the salute symbolizes rebellion against totalitarian rule, signifying thanks, admiration and good-bye to a loved one. But Thai protesters have also cited the French Revolution’s values of liberty, equality, fraternity, while others said it means freedom, election and democracy.
Prayuth, often prickly with critics, stopped his speech when the students stood, and smiled calmly. “Anyone else wants to protest? Come quickly. Then I can continue with my speech,” he said into the microphone as the audience chuckled.
Since taking power from a civilian, elected government in May, the military has heavily suppressed resistance from opposition groups and activists. Martial law, invoked a few days before the coup, remains in effect and bans political gatherings of five or more people.
“Mockingjay,” the third movie in the “The Hunger Games” series, opens in Thai cinemas Thursday.

14 players have signed South Africa tour contract  confirms West Indies CricketBoardPrint
By: Associated Press | St. Jonh's (antigua) | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:11 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 4:13 pm
A month after a pay dispute controversially derailed its tour to India, the West Indies Cricket Board has confirmed that 14 top-flight players have signed contracts committing them to a three-Test series in South Africa.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India, the most powerful stakeholder in the game, suspended bilateral ties with the West Indies last month and threatened to claim millions in compensation after the Caribbean players quit the tour.
There was initially concern about the South Africa tour going ahead next month, but West Indies management took the first step last week by selecting a 15-man squad and giving players a week to sign and return the tour contracts.
The WICB on Tuesday said Darren Bravo was the only player among those selected who asked not to be considered for the series, due to personal reasons. He is yet to be replaced in the squad.
West Indies chief selector Clive Lloyd last week announced Denesh Ramdin was retained as captain and star batsman Chris Gayle was included in the squad for the Test series starting Dec. 17. The Test will be followed by three Twenty20 matches and five limited-overs internationals. The World Cup starts February in Australia and New Zealand.
“Of course at all times the selection panel aims to select the best and strongest team available,” he said at the time.
The decision to quit the tour plunged West Indies cricket into turmoil just a few months out from the World Cup and was widely criticized by the game’s administrators.
The International Cricket Council described the West Indies’ withdrawal from the India tour as “damaging and unacceptable” and indicated that similar actions in future would jeopardize players’ participation in lucrative domestic tournaments like the Indian Premier League.
West Indies Test squad: Denesh Ramdin (captain), Sulieman Benn, Jermaine Blackwood, Kraigg Braithwaite, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Sheldon Cottrell, Shannon Gabriel, Chris Gayle, Jason Holder, Leon Johnson, Kemar Roach, Marlon Samuels, Jerome Taylor, Chadwick Walton. One to be added.

Low-key Cristiano Ronaldo-Lionel Messi duel as Portugal wins1-0The main attraction was an anticipated Ronaldo-Messi duel which failed to deliver in a lackluster game. (Source: AP)
By: Associated Press | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:57 pm
Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi had left the pitch long before Raphael Guerreiro’s stoppage-time header gave Portugal a 1-0 win over Argentina in a friendly on Tuesday.
The world’s two best players were substituted at halftime at Old Trafford, with Ronaldo rarely shining in a stadium he graced for six seasons with Manchester United.
Messi struck the post in the 11th minute. Earlier, the Barcelona superstar hinted in an interview with Argentina sports daily Ole that he might not stay with the club for his entire career.
Germany also struck late in a 1-0 away win, as Toni Kroos scored in the 89th against Spain though the past two world champions fielded far from full-strength lineups.
Brazil made it six straight wins since a humiliating end to its home World Cup. The winning goal came in the 83rd against Austria as newcomer Roberto Firmino’s 25-meter shot sealed a 2-1 victory.
On a busy day of international friendlies worldwide, it was France 1, Sweden 0; Italy 1, Albania 0; Ireland 4, United States 1; and Japan 2, Australia 1 in a clash of 2015 Asian Cup favorites.
The main attraction was an anticipated Ronaldo-Messi duel which failed to deliver in a lackluster game.
Guerreiro, a second-half substitute, met a right-wing cross from Ricardo Quaresma with a thumping header in the first of two minutes of stoppage time.
Germany ended Spain’s run of 34 games without a loss at home despite having only three starters from the side that thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the World Cup semifinals.
Real Madrid midfielder Kroos unleashed a long-distance shot that skipped off the wet grass at Balaidos Stadium in Vigo and over substitute goalkeeper Kiko Casilla, marring his international debut.
For Brazil, Firmino’s international career began last weekend and the Hoffenheim midfielder replaced Luiz Adriano in the second half to ensure Brazil got a fortunate win, firing a rising shot past Austria goalkeeper Ramazan Oeczan.
David Luiz appeared to foul an Austria defender before connecting with Oscar’s corner to open the scoring in the 64th. Austria defender Aleksandar Dragovic leveled in the 75th from a penalty kick.
“We have to work on details,” Dunga said through an interpreter. “This is the beginning and we can build on it next year.”
On a cold, rainy night, Neymar was seldom a factor, and Dunga took off his captain in stoppage time, allowing him to symbolically hand over the armband to Thiago Silva. The former skipper had recently complained about the coach’s choice of Neymar to lead the team.
France captain Raphael Varane, like his Real Madrid teammate Kroos, scored a late winning goal, heading in a corner from Antoine Griezmann in the 83rd minute against Sweden in Marseille. Another Madrid player, Karim Benzema, shot his penalty over the bar three minutes later.
Sweden was uninspired and had continued…

Chhattisgarh sterilisation: 28 women discharged; escorted backhomeBy: Press Trust of India | Bilaspur | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:56 pm
As many as 28 out of the 122 women undergoing treatment at various hospitals after the botched sterilisation surgeries in Chhattisgarh’s Bilaspur district, have been discharged after successful treatment, an official said in Bilaspur on Wednesday. “Twenty eight women affected in the sterilisation camps were discharged from different hospitals of Bilaspur after treatment on Tuesday evening. Each of these women was handed a cheque of Rs 50,000 as per the announcement made by Chief Minister Raman Singh after the incident,” the official said.
Bilaspur Divisional Commissioner Sonmoni Borah and Collector Siddharth Komal Singh Pardeshi were present during their discharge and vehicles were arranged by the administration to send these women home, he said. Those discharged include six from Gaurela, 10 from Pendra, nine from Marwahi and three from Takhatpur regions. “18 patients from the district Hospital and 10 from CIMS have been discharged after successful treatment,” he said.
Thirteen women had died after undergoing tubectomies in state-run sterilisation camps conducted in Bilaspur district on November 8 and 10. While 12 of the 83 women, who were operated upon at the camp in Pendari village on November 8 died, a protected Baiga tribe woman was the lone casualty from at Pendra block, where around 56 women underwent surgeries at three different camps on November 10.
On directives of Raman Singh, special medical measures have been taken for treatment of the women who had fallen ill after the surgeries, the official said. Meanwhile, officials asked the discharged women and their family members to inform them about any problem after reaching home. To ensure safety of these women, they were shifted to their homes in vehicles arranged by administration, escorted by officers and employees, he said.

Mullaperiyar: Kerala to convene all-party meet on Sundaywater rights
The government will convene an all-party meeting to discuss the developments related to the Mullaperiyar dam on November 23.
Briefing the media on the decisions of the Cabinet and a conference of Members of Parliament from the State held here on Wednesday, Minister for Rural Development and Culture K.C. Joseph said the MPs would raise the Mullaperiyar issue in Parliament and bring the situation arising from raising of the water level in the dam to 142 feet to the notice of the Central government.
The Minister said the MPs would highlight issues such as fears of the people, unsafe condition of the dam and threat to the ecology of the Periyar Tiger Reserve. The Cabinet had discussed the issues in detail. The government had asked the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) to submit a report on the impact of rising water level in the dam on the Periyar Reserve within two days.
Mr. Joseph said the water level in the dam was currently at 141.6 feet. Tamil Nadu had adopted a strategy of reducing outflow from the dam (intake to the Vaigai dam) to raise the water level in the name of the Supreme Court order.
He said the MPs would press the Centre for allotment of land from the Periyar Tiger Reserve for Sabarimala development. They would also make demands for inclusion of various development projects in the Railway Budget. Chief Minister Oommen Chandy would meet the Union Railway Minister in New Delhi shortly to present him a prioritised list for railway development in the State.

What falling gas prices mean for your walletWhat plunging gas prices mean for your wallet

Lower gas prices is like a tax cut for consumers. (AP)
The gas pump is a friendly place these days, not the graveyard for one’s disposable income it once was. With the price of a barrel of oil cratering to levels not seen in almost four years under the weight of weak demand and a plethora of supply now that the U.S. is a key oil producer, U.S. consumers are getting what amounts to a tax cut at the gas pumps.
Oil prices have dropped nearly 30% from the spring peak, and wholesale gas prices are now at a near four-year low, according to Wells Fargo. West Texas Intermediate Crude fell 0.5% to $75.64 Monday.
Every 10-cent decline in retail gasoline prices unlocks nearly $3 billion for the consumer to spend on other goods and services, according to Gina Martin Adams, senior analyst at Wells Fargo. She notes that in the past 12 months U.S. consumers have spent $357 billion filling their tanks with gas.
The national average price for a gallon of regular gas on Monday was $2.885, according to AAA. That’s down from $2.893 Sunday and $2.927 a week ago. A month ago, a gallon of regular fetched $3.144. The nearly 26-cent drop in the past month equates to roughly $7.8 billion in freed-up cash for consumers to either buy other stuff or pay down debt.
So what types of stocks benefit most from falling gas prices? On the consumer staples side, food and beverage stocks tend to fare well. But, industrials, especially airlines and air freight, “may offer the best way to take advantage of lower energy prices,” says Adams.

Sectarianism comes back to bite Saudi ArabiaComments
By Toby Matthiesen November 18

On Oct. 15, Nimr al-Nimr, a Saudi Arabian Shiite cleric, was sentenced to death by the Special Criminal Court in Riyadh. Since 2011, Nimr has become the figurehead of a protest movement centered in eastern Saudi Arabia that has been largely denied coverage by mainstream media. The sentencing has implications far beyond Nimr’s personal fate. The Saudi crackdown is important because it has set a precedent for how the kingdom deals with political dissent and not just because it is another example of Saudi anti-Shiism.
The timing of the sentence is puzzling. Saudi decision-making works in myriad ways. Some observers feel that Nimr’s death sentence is intended to show the Sunni population that alongside a number of long prison sentences issued against Sunnis who had supported Islamic State militants or al-Qaeda, the government is also being tough on Shiites. But this sectarian logic only further entrenches divisions and hostilities that have fueled the rise of extremist Islamic groups and the regional sectarian war.
The Saudi-sponsored doctrinal and strategic anti-Shiism has recently backfired at home, too. On Nov. 3, one day before Ashura, one of the holiest days in the Shiite Muslim calendar, Sunni militants opened fire on a crowd leaving a Shiite prayer hall in the al-Ahsa oasis in eastern Saudi Arabia. Several Shiites were killed, including a number of minors, and scores wounded. While the Shiites in Saudi Arabia experience institutional and religious discrimination, the state’s security forces had hitherto protected them against attacks by Sunni militants. Al-Qaeda and its various offshoots had for years planned attacks on Shiites in the Eastern Province, aiming to increase sectarian tensions in the kingdom and possibly provoke armed retaliation from the Shiites. Several such plots, including one believed to have been targeting senior Shiite cleric Hassan al-Saffar, were foiled in the past.
All official organs of the state, including the official clergy, were quick to denounce the Nov. 3 attack, and within a few days the security forces had hunted down the perpetrators, killing several of them while suffering casualties themselves. This was seen as a sign that the state would not tolerate sectarian violence within its borders. Many Sunnis also declared their support for Sunni-Shiite coexistence in al-Ahsa on social media and attended the funeral for those killed during the attack.
However, the Saudi state and the religious establishment have for decades fueled sectarian animosities across the region. Saudi recruits for al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group are often motivated by a desire to contain Shiism and stem Iranian influence in the region – strategic objectives that Saudi media perpetuates ad infinitum. Anti-Shiite (and anti-Christian and anti-Jewish) incitement is spread across the region by Saudi-based television channels. It was encouraging that immediately after the attacks the long-standing Saudi Minister of Information Abdel Aziz Khoja announced the closure of perhaps the worst of those TV stations, Wisal. But in a sign that factions within the Saudi regime are divided over how to deal with the Shiites and with Sunni extremism in the kingdom, the minister was dismissed the next day, and Wisal, which retains some popularity in Saudi Arabia and the wider region, is still up and running.
Nimr’s political role is rooted in a long tradition of Shiite activism, which goes back to the foundation of the Saudi kingdom, and which has led to the establishment of Shiite Islamist movements since the 1970s. He hails from a prominent family from Awamiya, a relatively poor Shiite village surrounded by date farms outside of Qatif, the largest Shiite city in Saudi Arabia. Awamiya has a long history of resistance to the Saudi monarchy. Indeed, Nimr’s grandfather led an armed revolt in 1929-1930 against Saudi tax collectors and Wahhabi missionaries, who were sent to the Eastern Province after the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz bin Saud, conquered it in 1913.
Awamiya was also one of the centers of the Shiite uprising in 1979 that was inspired by the Iranian Revolution. Nimr became politicized during these events and joined the Shirazi movement, which had started the uprising. The Shirazi movement was a transnational Shiite political organization led by the Iraqi-Iranian cleric Muhammad Mahdi al-Shirazi, but the bulk of its supporters were Shiite Muslims from the Persian Gulf states (mainly Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia). Nimr enrolled in the movement’s religious school (hawza) in Iran and then became a teacher in the movement’s hawza in Sayyida Zeinab, the suburb of the Syrian capital of Damascus that became a key transnational hub for Shiite pilgrims, students and activists.
By the early 1990s, the Saudi members of the Shirazi movement negotiated a political settlement with the Saudi government and accepted a general amnesty offered by then-King Fahd in return for the halt of their oppositional activities. A number of opposition activists, however, and particularly a group of religious clerics led by Nimr, opposed the amnesty agreement because they thought that the Saudi state was not  fundamentally altering the subaltern status of the Shiites. And while Nimr returned to Saudi Arabia together with the other activists after 1993, his rejection of the 1993 agreement came to define his rivalry with the more accommodationist group in the Shirazi movement, represented by al-Saffar.
Nimr nonetheless remained a rather marginal figure throughout the 2000s, as King Abdullah tried to reach out to the Shiites and included some in the representative institutions of the Saudi state. But as regional sectarian tensions and the Saudi-Iranian rivalry intensified, and with renewed Shiite protests in the Eastern Province in 2009, many young Saudi Shiites came to admire Nimr’s fiery sermons because of his direct criticism of the state’s anti-democratic and anti-Shiite foundations. In one of his most famous sermons, he seemed to argue that the Shiites might one day secede if they could not realize their political demands within the borders of the Saudi state. Shortly afterward, Nimr went into hiding to avoid arrest and only reemerged in 2011 as the uprisings in neighboring Bahrain and in the Saudi Eastern Province gained pace.
Nimr was the only Saudi Shiite cleric to unanimously support both the protests in Bahrain and the protests that had erupted across the Eastern Province. His former colleagues in the Shirazi movement, such as al-Saffar, were much more cautious and at times even urged the youth to stay at home to not further inflame the situation (all forms of public protest are banned in Saudi Arabia).
Therefore, Nimr became the main figurehead of the protest movement centered on Awamiya and Qatif. But given the harsh repression leashed out against the demonstrators (more than 20 young men have been killed by security forces in the Eastern Province since 2011) and the lack of support from other regions of Saudi Arabia, the protests eventually fizzled out. Though, in July 2012, police shot Nimr in the leg and arrested him, sparking renewed mass protests. Since 2013, however, the protests have again become smaller, and it is therefore a surprise to many that the Saudi judiciary would now issue a death sentence against Nimr, a move that has reinvigorated the protest movement and further inflamed sectarian tensions in the region and beyond.
While the sentence can be rejected by King Abdullah, or commuted into a lengthy prison sentence, it is not certain that this will happen. Human rights organizations point out that the evidence that led to this judgment is mainly based on Nimr’s sermons, and he therefore has to be considered a prisoner of conscience. Nimr supported the right of the people to choose their own government and called for the downfall of the Saudi ruling family. In a highly unusual move for a Shiite cleric, he also supported the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And while Nimr repeatedly called upon the local youth to be ready to die as martyrs, he urged them not to “return bullets with bullets” but to instead use peaceful means such as demonstrations and civil disobedience instead.
The verdict also mentions Nimr’s association with “wanted terrorists,” a reference to a list of 23 men who are wanted for their roles in the protests since 2011 and for allegedly attacking security forces. Several of those men have been killed in the last two years in shootouts that activists say resemble government-approved assassinations. His death sentence is just one of a number of extremely harsh sentences against people involved in the protest movement. Several other Saudi Shiites were also sentenced to death , among them a nephew of Nimr, who was 17 years old at the time of his arrest.
While Nimr had already been an iconic figure for Shiite Muslims in the Gulf, and protests in solidarity with him had repeatedly been held in Bahrain, after the last verdict he has become a household name among Shiites across the world. If he is executed, the Gulf Shiites will have a martyr that symbolizes their struggle against oppression, and some of his supporters will want revenge. Indeed, Shiite hardliners, from Lebanese Hezbollah to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, have said that Saudi Arabia would cross a red line if Nimr is executed, and most major Ayatollahs have called for his release.
The bottom line remains that within a few weeks, a key Saudi Shiite cleric has been sentenced to death in an unfair trial and a group of Sunni militants were able to kill Shiites in a house of worship on the eve of Ashura. It is hard to see how Shiite Muslims should feel safe and accepted in a state where anti-Shiism is perpetuated in schooling and public discourse and such atrocities are allowed to happen. The recent killings have confirmed the truism that Gulf Arab support for sectarian hate speech and militias abroad would one day backfire, and they have set a worrying precedent. Parts of the Saudi ruling family may finally feel that their long-standing association with the Wahhabi religious establishment and radical anti-Shiite groups in the region may have been a strategic mistake. But these ties are ties that bind, and they are difficult to undo. After decades of using anti-Shiism as a strategic tool at home and abroad it will be virtually impossible to backtrack without alienating the core constituencies of the Saudi regime. And so the contradictions within the Saudi political system, and the regional sectarian war, are likely to get worse rather than better in the foreseeable future.
Toby Matthiesen is a research fellow in Islamic and Middle Eastern studies at Pembroke College, University of Cambridge. He is the author of “ The Other Saudis: Shiism, Dissent and Sectarianism ,” which outlines the history of political movements among the Shiites of Saudi Arabia and their relationship with the Saudi state. It will be published by Cambridge University Press in January 2015.

Ex-Redskins applaud Grudens blunt talkBy Liz Clarke November 18 Follow @lizclarketweet

Jay Gruden ’s blunt critique of quarterback Robert Griffin III and most everyone involved in Sunday’s 27-7 loss to Tampa Bay is exactly what the locker room needs to hear, in the view of two former Redskins Pro Bowl veterans of losing seasons and playoff runs alike.
Both Brian Mitchell and Tre Johnson , offensive starters on Washington teams of the 1990s, said that honest criticism earns NFL players’ respect —even if negative — as long as it’s fair and evenly dispensed, as they feel Gruden’s has been to date.
If anything, they said, they’d like to see Gruden go further in putting his imprint on the Redskins and laying out expectations for performance, effort and professionalism.
“What this team needs is an identity and focus, and it has to start from the coaches,” said Johnson, 43, who earned Pro Bowl honors in 1999 and now provides postgame analysis for 106.7 The Fan. “And you have to provide some tangible solutions. Provide leadership: ‘This is our system. This is our identity. This is what we have to do to be this team, and if you can’t do it, I’m going to get some new players,’ ” Johnson said in a telephone interview.
“To keep perpetuating the same thing over and over is the technical definition of insanity.
“Don’t get me wrong: The players have to execute. If they’re not executing, you’ve got to get rid of ‘em. It’s way past time to make the tough decisions. It’s tougher than just putting in a revolving door at the quarterback position.”
Mitchell, a former running back and holder of numerous NFL records as a return specialist, went on an epic rant immediately following the error-plagued loss to the previously 1-8 Buccaneers on Comcast Sportsnet’s postgame show, calling the performance “atrocious” and “despicable.”
Nonetheless, in a telephone interview this week, Mitchell said he hoped Gruden would be given the chance to turn the team around.
“From what I’ve seen, he’s being straightforward,” Mitchell said. “I want to see it work with Gruden.”
But it’s past time for players to take responsibility for their shortcomings and forge an identity, Mitchell added.
“This is Week 11, and I haven’t seen the identity established on the offense, defense and not special teams,” Mitchell said. “I’ve been on teams where we basically came together as a team because we are the people on the field. You watch this team: You don’t see enough men. You see boys playing football.”
Mitchell applauded the intensity wide receiver Pierre Garcon brings to each snap, whether targeted on a throw or not. And he feels that no player is delivering like DeSean Jackson.
Johnson agreed, adding that he couldn’t understand why the Redskins weren’t throwing to Jackson more.
“You’ve got DeSean Jackson, Pierre Garcon, Jordan Reed, Alfred Morris, Roy Helu, Silas Redd, who any other team would love to have,” Johnson said. “They have six receivers deep, and you can’t get ‘em the ball?”
But Mitchell’s conclusion, 10 games into the season, is that too many players have fallen into a mind-set of entitlement that he feels permeates the Redskins organization, top to bottom.
“Everyone in that locker room, whether they’re 31 years old to 21 or whatever, has to start focusing on being the best football player they can be,” Mitchell said. “That stuff goes a long way. If everyone on this team is thinking, ‘I’m supposed to be the star,’ you’ve got a problem.
“Nobody on this team has done anything here! The last Super Bowl team here [XXVI], I was on the team!” Mitchell said. “I can tell you one damn thing: We would have fought harder than they fought (against Tampa Bay).”

Why schools matter when youre buying a homeeven if you dont have childrenheadline(AP Photo/Orlin Wagner)
Schools matter when buying a home, even for those who don’t have children. 
Homes cost more in quality school districts – about $50 more per square foot in areas with top-ranked schools versus average-ranked schools, according to real estate company Redfin .  (More on that later.) And they typically retain their values better when it’s time to sell.
But that doesn't mean that you can't find a home that's affordable. RealtyTrac has identified 489 Zip codes with elementary schools that had test scores at least one-third higher than the average in their respective states and homes with prices that were no more than one-third of the median household income. These areas had the added bonus of a low unemployment rate.  Here are the areas that topped the list:
Not to worry if you don't see your area above.  Remember the list only represents 4 percent of the Zip codes that meet RealtyTrac's criteria for affordability, great test scores and low unemployment. Also, many states were not included in the study, which relied on home prices from recorded sales deeds.  States that do not require disclosure of the full sales price on a deed were tossed out of the analysis.  More than a dozen states fall into that category, including:  Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.
Now for the less affordable.  There are 127  Zip codes with great elementary schools -- again, test scores that were at least one-third higher than the average for their respective states, according to RealtyTrac.  But in these areas, the average price of a home required at least two-thirds of the median household income in the county.  Here's that list:
From the Redfin study, which was released last year, comes the most startling example of how schools affect home prices.  This illustrates how two similar homes less than a mile from one another can be more than $100,000 apart on price based on the school district they're in.
 

5 minutes with ballerina Misty CopelandBy Helena Andrews November 18 Follow @helena_andrews

“Misty is prettier than you, she’s faster than you, she’s thinner than you, she can jump higher than you…but she is you,” explained Septime Webre, creative director of the Washington Ballet, at a news conference on Tuesday. Blunt? Um, yes. True? Also yes–although we’re not sure about that last part. Webre’s point was that the best of ballet should be like watching “the best of yourself” on stage.
The superhero in question here is Misty Copeland, the American Ballet Theatre soloist (and viral video star ) who will make her American “Swan Lake” debut at the Kennedy Center. Copeland and Washington Ballet’s Brooklyn Mack, both African American, will dance the two leading roles. The performance is historic . The tickets? Almost all sold out.
We pulled Copeland, who described her fame as “crazy,” to the side at her D.C. press conference just before the onslaught of selfies.
Please tell me you’ve seen “Black Swan.”
I really enjoyed it, but I understood what it was. It was a horror film. I mean I’m a dancer and I knew that it wasn’t supposed to be portraying what we are. The great thing about the movie was that it provoked people to think about ballet, which is always a great thing. But once they open up that conversation, it’s educating them on what ballet is.
So there will be no psychological breakdowns happening in the wings at the Kennedy Center?
[She laughs] Natalie Portman will not be on stage with me. No one’s going to get killed backstage.
What would surprise people about the life of a ballerina?
It’s not as cutthroat as you would think. Once you get into a professional company you spend more time with these people than your own family. I’ve been with American Ballet Theatre for almost 15 years, so it’s not as crazy as people think it. We’re really close friends and we have to be able to get along or you just won’t survive in that atmosphere.
But ‘The Real Ballet Dancers of Swan Lake’ is not a good idea for a reality show?
There is drama. People date within ballet companies and they marry within ballet companies because you spend the most time with these people. You get each other. Dancers tend to stick together.
When you’re not dancing you’re____?
Shopping at Barney’s, Intermix, Bergdorf’s, online. Or I’m eating–
So ballerinas do eat?
We have to, we’re athletes. That’s something that people don’t really think about. It’s what’s so great about the Under Armour ad because it’s the first time people are seeing ballet dancers as the athletes that we are. We’re meant to make it look effortless on stage. But we dance up to eight hours a day, five to six days a week, so you have to eat to fuel your body.
Your last meal would be ____?
I love fish and I love sushi, but if I’m going to be bad it would probably be something like going to Red Lobster and having a lot of those biscuits.
What makes you really angry?
When people don’t understand me. Like when they assume a certain thing about me or are just not open to hearing what it is I represent or what it is I want to say. It’s easy for people to think I’m an aggressive person because I have a voice and I speak so openly about my experiences.
If you had to explain yourself in your on words what would you say?
Passionate. Caring. Warm. Adventurous.
What makes you truly happy?
Um [She pauses for less than a second] dancing.

Why Facebook wants to friend your bossBy Jena McGregor November 17 Follow @jenamcgregor
A professional version called “Facebook at Work” would reportedly pit the social network against LinkedIn, Microsoft and Google. (Reuters)
According to a report Sunday in the Financial Times, Facebook is developing a new product to help the social network giant find a home at work. Called "Facebook at Work," the new site is reportedly designed for employee collaboration — letting groups of colleagues chat with each other and share work on professional documents — and, in the process, seems aimed at getting more bosses over the fear factor  of social media use on the job.
It will hardly be the first company to try. Facebook's  reported new service is yet another sign of how much the tech industry sees the workplace as fertile ground for innovation. Professional  tasks  like online recruiting and job hunting can be laborious and time-consuming. And many workplaces still relegate internal collaboration to e-mail, despite its limitations.
Even those companies that have adopted an "enterprise social network," as some of the newer collaboration tools are called, still struggle with getting workers to use it effectively. A 2013 report from Deloitte predicted that 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies would have partially or fully launched a social network for their business by the end of last year. Yet Deloitte 's own research found that between 20 and 30 percent of employees don't sign up for it if registration is required, and that just 40 percent of those who do register will make a single post within an average month. Those numbers, the report states, "reflect the challenges companies have always faced popularizing internal networking technologies."
That could give Facebook something of an advantage, given how popular the site already is with consumers. The Financial Times reports that the new site will function much like Facebook already does, but will let users keep their personal and professional profiles separate, so that workers' posts about project updates and meeting notes won't mix with their Halloween costume photos and cat videos. People's familiarity with the original network, however, could make it less difficult for companies to lure them onto its sister platform. (Facebook declined to comment for this story.)
Even so, Facebook will confront plenty of competition from tech companies that have long been trying to revamp the outdated workplace with tools for collaborating and communicating professionally. There is the professional social network LinkedIn, of course, as well as a growing market of industry-specific professional sites. Google offers a host of widely used and well-known collaboration tools. Two years ago, Microsoft paid  $1.2 billion in cash for Yammer, which offers private social networks for employees. Salesforce.com has Chatter.  And there are several messaging tools aimed at business users — including Slack , by Flickr co-founder Stewart Butterfield , which has been getting lots of recent attention .
One of the earliest players in the market was IBM, which launched its first social network for business clients back in 2007, after years of using a proprietary one in-house. "A lot of our clients were coming to us, seeing these social tools on the consumer side, but needing additional levels of requirements that those consumer tools weren't hitting [such as compliance and data security]," said Suzanne Livingston, the senior product manager for IBM Connections. IBM, which has the largest market share in the industry, according to IDC , says its product is used by three out of four Fortune 100 companies. 
There is a lot of interest in such products, and the tech industry is responding. Yet the challenge for companies that offer them won't just be getting past concerns about social networks at work, but making sure the tools actually help people do the real work that needs to get done. "You can make a piece of technology as easy to use with an many features as possible," Livingston said, "but if a company doesn't know what to use it for — how to change the work people are actually performing — that's where it can get into trouble."

Where homeownership is the most  and least  affordableBy Jonnelle Marte November 17 Follow @jonnelle
(Bigstock)
The hurdles to homeownership are many. On top of  saving for the down payment , some people are too busy stressing about other debt to want to take on a mortgage. Others are better off  stashing the money away for retirement.
But all that aside, many people living in large cities couldn’t afford to buy a house even if they wanted to.
A household earning the median income can only afford a median-priced home in 10 of the 25 largest U.S cities, according to a new report from Interest.com .
That’s actually a slight improvement from last year, when only eight of the largest 25 cities had median incomes that were enough to afford a median-priced home. But for anyone hoping to see their name on a deed in the near future, it may mean having to relocate.
Interest.com compiled data on median home prices, income, average property taxes and insurance costs, along with other mortgage-related information, to calculate whether someone earning the median income in each city could afford to buy a median-priced home in that area.
Topping the list of cities where homeownership was most affordable was Minneapolis, where people earning the median income made 23 percent more than they needed to afford a median-priced home in the area. Next up was Atlanta, where median earners made 22 percent more than they needed. Anyone want to buy in Detroit?
The major cities that turned out to be the most unaffordable are exactly the ones you’d expect. In San Francisco, the median-earning household fell 46 percent short of the income needed to afford the median home price of $769,600. In Portland, median earners were 5 percent short of having enough income to buy a median-priced home.
So why does homeownership feel so out of reach for urbanites? For starters, home prices grew by 6 percent last year in big cities, more than the 4 percent increase seen nationwide, according to Interest.com. And income, which only increased by 2 percent, isn’t keeping up, the study found. Wondering if you’re ready to make the plunge? Interest.com has a tool for helping people figure out how much mortgage they can afford .

Finland's Nokia launched a new brand-licensed tablet computer on Tuesday which is designed to rival Apple's iPad Mini, just six months after the company sold its ailing phones and devices business to Microsoft for over $7 billion.
Nokia, a name which was once synonymous with mobile phones until first Apple and then Samsung Electronics eclipsed the Finnish company with the advent of smart phones, said the manufacturing, distribution and sales of the new N1 tablet, will be handled under license by Taiwan's Foxconn .

Sebastian Nystrom, the head of products at Nokia's Technologies unit, said the company was looking to follow up with more devices and will also look into eventually returning to the smartphones business by brand-licensing.

Retirement Retirement Planning
Delaying retirement saving in hopes of better cash flow in the future might not be a good idea.
Most people entertain the idea of becoming an entrepreneur or independent contractor to become their own boss. Being in control can be a satisfying aspect of business. For certain things, including retirement planning, however, self-employed small business owners are more likely to delay.
cComments
Having a successful business doesn't guarantee that you will have enough savings and assets when you retire. It's best to be in control and plan ahead in order avoid financial woes in the future. Business owners should anticipate their future expenses such as health care and long term...

Prioritizing business: Most small business owners dedicate the majority of their wealth and effort to the business. When deciding between growing a business and saving for their own retirement, most often, small business owners choose to dedicate all their resources to the former.
Businesses can be sold or transferred, but retirement is much more difficult to delay or avoid altogether. Therefore, investing in a retirement plan should be a priority. What’s more, with a small business 401(k), also known as Solo 401(k), plan holders are also allowed to take out a loan from the retirement fund. The borrowed amount can be used to cover any urgent financial needs, including funding their businesses. As long as the interest and principal are paid back according to the terms, the loan is tax-free and penalty-free.
Relying on selling the business for retirement: Most small business owners expect to sell their businesses at a high price when they are ready to retire. They expect proceeds from selling the business to cover their living costs during retirement.
Even if the business does sell for a healthy amount as planned, it won’t hurt to have an additional retirement fund. As the saying goes, it is not wise to have all your eggs in one basket, and having a retirement account is usually a good backup plan.
Simply delaying contribution: There is no requirement for independent contractors and small business owners without full-time employees to set up a retirement plan. Therefore, many keep delaying it, thinking that they can start contributing to a small business 401(k) when the business improves.
No matter how much business owners plan, they can never guarantee that sales will improve and costs will decrease. Even when the business is growing, unexpected opportunities might come up and demand more cash. Therefore, delaying retirement saving in hopes of better cash flow in the future might not be a good idea. Also, investment in a small business 401(k) can grow exponentially, and the longer the money stays in the fund, the more it can grow.
Another point to keep in mind is that with a small business 401(k) plan such as Solo 401(k), contributions are entirely at the plan holder’s discretion. If a plan holder finds himself entirely short of cash for a year, he can contribute less or even suspend contribution for that year without any consequence to the existing fund.

In 1965, Ford paired up with an L.A.-based shop run by Carroll Shelby to breathe a dose of race-bred muscle into its new Mustang.

Monday afternoon, some 50 years after that initial partnership, the duo is scheduled to pull the wraps off an all-new Shelby GT350 Mustang. To be unveiled at the future site of the Carroll Shelby museum in Gardena, Calif., and headed to this week’s L.A. Auto Show, the new GT350 is a track-savvy but street-friendly version of the recent sixth-generation Ford Mustang .
“We wanted to build the best possible Mustang for the places we most love to drive — challenging back roads ... and the track on weekends,” said Raj Nair, Ford's product development chief.
The GT350 Mustang is the first of several performance-oriented versions of the new Mustang expected from Ford over the next few years. It joins a growing number of 21st-century muscle cars from the same brands that ruled the segment a generation ago.

“It’s nice to see,” Nair said of this recent renaissance. “There have been so many times in this industry when people have predicted the death of these vehicles.”
Current standouts in the muscle world are the 707-horsepower Hellcat versions of the Dodge Challenger coupe and Charger sedan, and Chevy’s supercharged, 580-horsepower Camaro ZL1 and the $75,000 track-oriented Camaro Z/28 with 505 naturally-aspirated horsepower.
They’ll make for heady competition for the Shelby GT350 Mustang when it hits the roads later in 2015.
“I certainly respect those other cars,” Nair said. “But this GT350 is going to give them a real run for their money.”
The heart of the new GT350 is a race-derived 5.2-liter V-8 engine. Final specs haven’t yet been released, but Ford is promising that it will be the most powerful naturally-aspirated production engine it has ever built, pumping out more than 500 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque.
This new engine is unique for a production car, using what’s known as a flat-plane crankshaft, a feature common in racing cars but difficult to adapt for the street.
If I could pick one car to be killed by in a hit and run drunk driver incident, this would be it.

That's why it's usually only seen in exotics from companies with extensive racing pedigrees, including Ferrari’s 458, Porsche’s 918 Spyder supercar, and McLaren’s P1 and 650S.
A lighter flat-plane crankshaft allows the engine to rev quicker and more easily than one with a traditional and heavier cross-plane design. This gives the car a broad torque curve, for power throughout the rev range, and quicker throttle response for blasting out of corners.
Only a six-speed manual transmission will be offered.
The Mustang’s chassis — already excellent, with the addition of independent rear suspension for this new sixth-generation — gets another upgrade for the GT350. The car will have continuously-variable suspension dampers that read road conditions and driver input, then adjust accordingly. Drivers will be able to select various stiffness levels from within the car.
“We took the best Ford Mustang yet and massaged every aspect of the car that affects the performance driving experience,” said Jamal Hameedi, chief engineer of Ford global performance vehicles.
The GT350 will also have five settings for its ABS, stability and traction control, exhaust, and powertrain. Other highlights include Brembo brakes with 15.5-inch rotors in the front and 15 inches in the rear, Recaro race seats, and a flat-bottom steering wheel. Ford even went so far as to take out any chrome or bright trim inside the car that might cause glare on the track.
The outside of the GT350 Mustang gets the familiar bolt-on styling, with functional air vents carved into the aluminum front fenders and hood. The grille opening is carbon fiber, while the front and rear bumpers have been rethought to add extra downforce.
Nineteen-inch alloy wheels poke out of the wheel wells. At the back, a quartet of exhaust pipes stick out from an aggressive rear diffuser. Ford went conservative on the rear spoiler, adding only a thin strip across the trunk lid.
Pricing will be announced closer to the car’s on-sale date in the second half of 2015. It won’t be cheap. The loaded Mustang GT we recently tested went for a hair over $44,000, and this GT350 Mustang will probably cost a good bit more.

Brookings guy on CNN: Media need to suppress Islamic State videos. ReallyBy Erik Wemple November 18 Follow @ErikWemple
On this afternoon’s edition of “Wolf,” host Wolf Blitzer asked Brookings Institution senior fellow Michael O’Hanlon if U.S. policy regarding hostages taken by terrorist organizations needed some tweaking. The question relates to a directive from President Obama to review how the United States handles hostage situations , following the beheading of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig by the Islamic State terror group.
Before O’Hanlon addressed the government policy dimension of hostages, he went straight at the media:
Well, you know, Wolf, one thing I’ve been thinking of and I hope you don’t mind my saying so, it’s not at CNN’s expense, but I wonder if the media is actually giving too much visibility to these horrible, brutal, disgusting videos. Obviously it’s what ISIS wants us to do, that’s why they release these. And we’re not going to be able to suppress it entirely but I guess one policy that I would want to ask people to think about changing is how much coverage we want to give to this. Because it acts in some ways as a propaganda tool for ISIS when they get so much footage out of these terrible atrocities.
No question that media outlets should always consider the propaganda motives of organizations — especially terrorist ones — that distribute videos and manifestos and the like. Yet the dictates of newsworthiness resolve O’Hanlon’s central concern here: The group’s barbarism will generate less and less reaction with each depraved iteration. And as Steve Rose wrote in the Guardian last month , republication of the group’s videos doesn’t always equate to a propaganda victory:
Isis could well be losing the propaganda war all by itself. The recent execution of Alan Henning, in particular, was condemned the world over. The video pleas to spare Henning’s life, from his wife and British Muslim leaders, stood in marked contrast to Isis’s own pumped-up rhetoric. They were calm, guileless, heartfelt, personal, entirely free of visual trickery. “Alan was volunteering with his Muslim friends to help the people of Syria,” said Barbara Henning in her video. “He was in the right place, doing the right thing.” The fact that Isis went ahead and killed him anyway, on the eve of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, has exposed them as both inhumane and un-Islamic. In propaganda terms, it was a colossal own-goal.
O’Hanlon’s prescription, in other words, may pack a set of dangerous results — leaving people less than perfectly informed about the group’s atrocities.

Poll: American public split on whether to shred ConstitutionBy Greg Sargent November 18 Follow @theplumlinegs
A new USA Today poll finds the public is tilting slightly against Obama’s coming executive action to defer deportations:
President Obama’s plan to sign an executive order on immigration, expected as early as this week, will meet more resistance than support, a new USA TODAY Poll finds. Close to half of those surveyed, 46%, say he should wait for the new Republican-controlled Congress to act, and another one in 10 are unconvinced either way.
Just 42% of Americans say he should take action now, findings that reflect a familiar partisan divide between Democrats and Republicans. The president is considering an order that would prevent as many as 5 million people from being deported…
Democrats overwhelmingly want Obama to take action now, 60%-28%. Republicans by an even wider margin want him to wait, 76%-17%. Independents split with 44% supporting acting now, 46% endorsing delay.
USA Today works awfully hard here to portray this as profound public skepticism, but as Kevin Drum notes , the public — and independents — are actually pretty close to split. Indeed, it’s a bit surprising the public is this closely divided, given the deafening roar of Constitutional doomsday rhetoric we’ve been hearing from the party that just supposedly received a smashing mandate from “the American people” in the last election.
My headline was a joke, but there’s a serious point here: No doubt many people sincerely believe it’s overwhelmingly obvious this action does threaten a genuine Constitutional crisis, yet even on this question, the American public remains polarized along partisan lines. Just as they were on George W. Bush’s exertions of executive power.
I actually expect the public to tilt more strongly against Obama’s action, if and when he does announce one. It seems likely that, even if majorities tend to support legislative legalization, Americans could react very differently to executive action on immigration.
On the other hand, as Drum points out, this probably holds little political risk for Democrats overall, even if executive action does bring about partisan Armageddon. David Brooks is very worried about this prospect . He predicts that Republicans will “rightly take it as a calculated insult,” driving everyone “into warfare mode,” resulting in “two more years of dysfunction that will further arouse public disgust and anti-government fervor.”
But as Drum notes, the poll also finds that almost nobody in America — 15 percent, to be exact — even expects Obama and the new GOP Congress to work together to find bipartisan compromise to begin with. In this case, Obama will be acting — belatedly, and after far too much dithering and delay, in the minds of many of his core supporters.  As E.J. Dionne puts it :
Yes, Washington may again be engulfed in partisan warfare. But at least this time, it will be over things that are actually happening.
I would also reiterate that what probably matters most politically over the long term, particularly heading into 2016, is what overall general impressions of the two parties Latinos end up retaining after this is all over.

The Central Japan Railway Company recently began test runs of a maglev train that can reach 500 kilometers per hour (that's about 310 mph). In the below video from the BBC, you can watch the train's gleeful first passengers go for a ride, their cameras and small kids in tow.
That scene is both a testament to Japan's commitment to high-speed rail, and a reminder of how far the U.S. lags. The fastest train Amtrak's got, the Acela, tops out along its route from Washington to Boston at around 150 miles per hour. And the gulf between these two speeds is important: It's the difference between a trip from D.C. to New York that feels like long-distance travel, and and one that feels like a transit commute.
If we had a train on the East Coast that traveled the speed of Japan's new maglev, you could commute from D.C. to New York in under an hour. You could get there about as fast as it takes some local commuters to travel from one end of the Silver Line to the other .
The implication is that truly high-speed rail could make intercity travel akin to intra-city commuting (maybe not between Denver and Seattle, but along the mid-Atlantic or within the Midwest). You could work in Washington and buy a cheaper home in Philadelphia. You could hire workers in Boston for your firm in New York.
Speed, in other words, changes geography. There's a potential downside to this — fast cars (and highways) made suburban sprawl possible by opening up whole new territory within commuting distance of downtown jobs. But fast trains also have the potential to further knit together the economies of nearby cities just too far apart for commuting today. They have the potential to open job prospects, or to expand your pool of affordable housing.
Of course, the cost of a ticket on-board would affect who can actually afford to commute out of state instead of just across town. But Japan is clearly thinking about the benefits of bringing cities closer together through transportation. The ultimate route the Central Japan Railway Company is currently building will stretch from Tokyo to Nagoya . And it will cut the ride between the two all the way down to 40 minutes.

Your old  embarrassing tweets just became much easier to findBy Caitlin Dewey November 18 Follow @caitlindewey

Until Tuesday afternoon, when Twitter released its first complete index, digging up old tweets — even from politicians, celebrities and other notables — was a surprisingly difficult task. Twitter’s infamously glitchy search function could only go back so far in time. Google only indexes a small percentage of all tweets, and is biased in favor of top-tier accounts.
So if you wanted to surface, say, those profane, insulting and otherwise unsavory tweets that basketball’s Kevin Durant sent circa 2009, you had two options: Navigate to Durant’s timeline, put a weight on your keyboard’s “down” arrow and hope to reach the bottom within your lifetime; or shell out thousands of dollars for an analytics service like Topsy (… which shuttered to the public a few months ago, anyway). You couldn’t jump to a particular month or year in a user’s timeline, as you can on Facebook. And you certainly couldn’t search a user’s corpus of tweets.
In other words, even Durant’s more offensive missives were pretty darn safe. Until now!

That’s because Twitter just began rolling out a new search infrastructure that will allow anyone to search every tweet ever published publicly. Here, for instance, is every tweet mentioning penguins in Twitter’s first year.  And here’s how @washingtonpost used to tweet , in the beginning. (Spoiler: with #lots #of #hashtags.)
One by one, the penguins are stealing my sanity…

That might not seem like a terribly profound deal, given that this information was technically out in the open already. But as anyone who has ever searched for an old tweet knows very well, “out in the open” is a relative term. A tweet from 2006 may technically be accessible, but it’s buried under eight years of digital sediment — thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of later tweets, each appearing reverse-chronologically, fossilizing the oldest tweets further, linking none of them to search results.
In fact, you can think of Twitter’s incomplete index as a corollary to the whole right-to-be-forgotten debate : In both cases, the material in question is still online — but since it’s not tied to a search index, it may as well not exist.
Twitter is rolling the index out by degrees: While the underlying infrastructure went live on Tuesday, a post on the platform’s official blog says they’ll continue tweaking how search results are displayed and rolling out “new product experiences,” whatever that means.
In either case, you have a little time to ponder the ancient tweets you’d most like to uncover. Or to clean up your own digital footprint ! You decide.

Believe it or not, there’s a professional sports franchise in D.C. that isn’t inspiring its lifelong fans to set fire to their team merchandise .
That team even has a few charismatic players who occasionally do amusing things, like competing in baby food tasting contests or posting Instagram photos of themselves with pigs in shopping centers. This post is about that team, the 7-2 Wizards. Specifically, it’s about Marcin Gortat having a good time on his off day.
Gortat was obviously not at the Redskins game on Sunday. Instead, he was touring the White House with some friends, including Polish actor Borys Szyc , who you probably don’t know from the 2009 film “Snow White and Russian Red” and this Axe body spray commercial .

Can California ban gun stores from advertising handguns on their signsBy Eugene Volokh November 18 Follow @volokhc
I blogged last week about Tracy Rifle & Pistol LLC. v. Harris (E.D. Cal.) , a case in which I’ve been hired to consult, and which the California Association of Federal Firearms Licensees, The Calguns Foundation, and Second Amendment Foundation are supporting. The case is a First Amendment challenge to Cal. Civil Code § 26820 (which was first enacted 1923, but is still being enforced today):
No handgun or imitation handgun, or placard advertising the sale or other transfer thereof, shall be displayed in any part of the premises where it can readily be seen from the outside.
Just yesterday, we filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the statute; you can read the full motion in a PDF , but I also include the text below:
Introduction
The sale of handguns is not only legal — it is constitutionally protected. The First Amendment protects truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech promoting lawful products or services, but especially when the products or services are themselves protected by other constitutional rights, such as the right to abortion or the right to buy contraceptives.[1] What is true for unenumerated constitutional rights must be at least as true for the enumerated right to bear arms, which includes the right to possess and acquire handguns.[2]
Plaintiff firearms dealers are therefore constitutionally entitled to convey truthful commercial information about handguns to the public, and the public has a corresponding interest in receiving that information. This includes plaintiffs’ right to advertise their products on-site — an especially useful form of advertising for sellers and consumers alike.[3] Yet California Penal Code § 26820 (“Section 26820”) prevents a firearms dealer from displaying any “handgun or imitation handgun, or [a] placard advertising the sale or other transfer thereof” anywhere that can be seen outside the four corners of its store. Section 26820 thus unconstitutionally prevents firearms dealers from advertising even the most basic commercial information — “Handguns for Sale” — at their places of business.
The government’s defense of Section 26820 would presumably rest on one of two theories. First, the government might argue that some people find handgun advertising offensive, and do not wish to see it in public places. But that “advertisements” might be “offensive … to those exposed to them” is “classically not [a] justification[] validating the suppression of expression protected by the First Amendment,” including advertising. Carey, 431 U.S. at 701. And the Court has “specifically declined to recognize a distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech that would render [the] interest [in preventing offense to viewers] a sufficient justification for a prohibition of commercial speech.” Bolger, 463 U.S. at 71-72.
Second, the government might argue that it wants to decrease handgun ownership, presumably on the theory that this will decrease violence or injury. But even if decreasing handgun ownership is a permissible justification for government regulations following Heller, it cannot justify this speech restriction. Even if California believes that buying a handgun is a bad decision, “the ‘fear that people would make bad decisions if given truthful information’ cannot justify content-based burdens on speech.” Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 2653, 2670-71 (2011) (citation omitted). The Supreme Court has “rejected the notion that the Government has an interest in preventing the dissemination of truthful commercial information in order to prevent members of the public from making bad decisions with the information.” Thompson v. Western States Medical Center, 535 U.S. 357, 374 (2002).
“The choice ‘between the dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available’ is one that ‘the First Amendment makes for us.’” Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2671 (citation omitted). So long as responsible, law-abiding adults may purchase handguns in California, the First Amendment prevents the State from enforcing Section 26820’s ban on on-site handgun advertising.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
California Penal Code section 26820, enacted in 1923, prohibits firearms dealers from displaying a “handgun or imitation handgun, or [a] placard advertising the sale or other transfer thereof” “in any part of the premises where it can readily be seen from the outside.”[4] As such, it not only bans any onsite advertisement outside a firearms dealer’s premises informing potential customers that it sells handguns, it bans any in-store advertisement (or firearms display) that can be seen through a glass door or window. As shown below, the California Department of Justice (“DOJ”), which enforces Section 26820, applies the law to ban the display of any picture or physical depiction of a handgun.
Plaintiffs are retail firearms dealers who wish to display truthful, nonmisleading material advertising the sale of handguns at their places of business. Section 26820 prevents them from doing so, and a dealer’s license is subject to forfeiture for violating the handgun advertising restriction. Cal. Penal Code §§ 26800, 26715(b); Cal. Admin. Code tit. 11, § 4024. The DOJ’s enforcement of the advertising ban has infringed Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, and the threat of further enforcement chills the protected speech of firearms dealers throughout the State. The DOJ has restricted each of the plaintiffs’ efforts to engage in truthful advertising:
Tracy Rifle. On September 12, 2014, the DOJ Bureau of Firearms inspected Plaintiff Tracy Rifle and Pistol LLC. (Declaration of Michael Baryla ISO Mot. for Preliminary Injunction (“Baryla Decl.”), ¶ 4.) At the time of the inspection, four of Tracy Rifle’s exterior windows were covered with large vinyl decals depicting firearms — three handguns and a rifle.[5] (Id.) As of the date of the inspection, each of these firearms could be lawfully purchased in California, and Tracy Rifle regularly carries each of the four guns depicted in the windows. (Id.) The Bureau of Firearms issued a “Notification of Inspection Findings” citing Plaintiffs Tracy Rifle and Michael Baryla for violating Section 26820 because of the handgun decals, and requiring Plaintiffs to take corrective action by February 11, 2015. (Id., ¶ 5.)
Ten Percent Firearms. On or about February 23, 2010, the DOJ Bureau of Firearms inspected Plaintiff Ten Percent Firearms in Taft, California. (Declaration of Wesley Morris ISO Mot. for Preliminary Injunction (“Morris Decl.”), ¶ 4; Declaration of Dean Rowden ISO Mot. for Preliminary Injunction (“Rowden Decl.”), ¶ 3.) Displayed on a post in Ten Percent’s parking lot was a 3-foot by 2-foot three-dimensional metal sign shaped like a revolver, hung approximately 9 feet off the ground. (Morris Decl., ¶ 4; Rowden Decl., ¶ 3.) The DOJ inspector informed Plaintiff Morris that the sign violated the handgun advertising restriction, and Ten Percent Firearms immediately took it down. (Morris Decl., ¶ 4; Rowden Decl., ¶ 4.) The Bureau of Firearms issued a “Notification of Inspection Findings” citing Plaintiffs Ten Percent Firearms and Morris for violating the handgun advertising ban.[6] (Morris Decl., ¶ 4; Rowden Decl., ¶ 4.)
Each Plaintiff desires to display truthful, nonmisleading on-site handgun advertising that is visible from the outside of their dealerships, and would do so, but for Section 26820 and the threat of forfeiting their dealer’s licenses. (Baryla Decl., ¶ 6; Morris Decl., ¶ 5; Declaration of Robert Adams ISO Mot. for Preliminary Injunction, ¶ 3; Declaration of Jeffrey Mullen ISO Mot. for Preliminary Injunction, ¶¶ 3-4.)
III. Argument
“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). Alternatively, “a preliminary injunction is appropriate when a plaintiff demonstrates that serious questions going to the merits [are] raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff’s favor.” Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1134-35 (9th Cir. 2011). An injunction is warranted under either formulation.
A.Plaintiffs Are Likely To Establish That Section 26820 Violates The First Amendment.
Section 26820 is unconstitutional because it prohibits firearms dealers from disseminating truthful, nonmisleading commercial information about a lawful, constitutionally protected product. The Supreme Court has struck down bans on advertising of abortion and contraceptives, partly because “the activity advertised pertained to constitutional interests” and “the information suppressed by this statute ‘related to activity with which, at least in some respects, the State could not interfere.’” Bigelow, 421 U.S. at 822 (abortion); Carey, 431 U.S. at 700-01 (1977) (citation omitted) (contraceptives). The Supreme Court has struck down even a more limited ban on advertising contraceptives in mailings, partly because “advertising for contraceptives … relates to activity which is protected from unwarranted state interference.” Bolger, 463 U.S. at 69. The same heightened constitutional protection extends to handguns, which are constitutionally protected against unwarranted interference by the Second Amendment. Heller, 554 U.S. at 628-29, 635.
Of course the First Amendment protects even commercial speech about products and activities that are not themselves constitutionally protected, such as alcohol, tobacco, and gambling. Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476 (1995) (disclosure of alcohol content on beer labels); 44 Liquormart, Inc. v Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484 (1996) (advertising of alcohol prices); Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525 (2001) (outdoor and point-of-sale tobacco advertising); Greater New Orleans Broad. Ass’n, Inc. v. United States, 527 U.S. 173 (1999) (gambling advertising). But the First Amendment even more clearly protects advertising of constitutionally protected products and activities.
The Supreme Court has articulated two different tests for commercial speech restrictions, but in this case both tests point in the same direction. First, Section 26820 fails the heightened scrutiny for content- and speaker-based commercial speech restrictions set forth by Sorrell and Thompson. Second, Section 26820 fails the commercial speech test articulated in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of New York, 447 U.S. 557 (1980), even assuming that this test survives Sorrell and Thompson. Under either test, the state bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of a commercial speech restriction. Thompson, 535 U.S. at 373; Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 770 (1993).
1. Section 26820 Is Presumptively Invalid Because It Imposes A Content- And Speaker-Based Burden On Protected Expression.
The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed in Sorrell that “heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted” when a statute “is designed to impose a specific, content-based burden on protected expression.” 131 S. Ct. at 2664. Even in the commercial speech context, “[t]he First Amendment requires heightened scrutiny whenever the government creates ‘a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.’” Id. (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989)). Indeed, “it is all but dispositive to conclude that a law is content-based and, in practice, viewpoint-discriminatory,” because such laws are “‘presumptively invalid.’” Id. at 2668 (quoting R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992)).
In Sorrell, the Supreme Court struck down a Vermont law that restricted pharmaceutical companies from using certain industry information to market drugs to doctors.[7] 131 S. Ct. at 2659-60. The Court explained that laws that impose special burdens on disfavored speech and single out disfavored speakers are constitutionally suspect. Id. at 2663-65. To that end, states are not permitted to advance their policy goals “through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by certain speakers,” id. at 2670, and “may not burden the speech of others in order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction.”[8] Id. at 2671. Instead, the Constitution requires that information be made freely available to the public, who are responsible for assessing its value:
The commercial marketplace, like other spheres of our social and cultural life, provides a forum where ideas and information flourish. Some of the ideas and information are vital, some of slight worth. But the general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the government, assess the value of the information presented.
Section 26820 suffers from the same constitutional infirmities confronted in Sorrell. The advertising restriction is content-based. The law applies only to handguns and does not apply to other firearms such as rifles or shotguns. No separate statute imposes a similar restriction on advertising the sale of rifles or shotguns,[9] and Plaintiffs are unaware of any other California law that imposes an outright ban on a retailer advertising a product that may lawfully be purchased from its store.
And Section 26820 engages in speaker-based discrimination by singling out firearms dealers. Thus, for example, a dealer is prevented from displaying advertisements that feature handguns in a campaign to promote public safety through the responsible use of handguns for self-defense. But an anti-gun group would remain free under Section 26820 to use similar imagery to picket in front of that same dealer, encouraging people not to purchase handguns or warning of the dangers of gun violence (indeed, the First Amendment protects such speech as well). So too, the statute operates in a way that is viewpoint-discriminatory, i.e., anti-handgun. Cf. Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2663 (noting that the law “burden[ed] disfavored speech by disfavored speakers” because it allowed the state to “supply academic organizations with prescriber-identifying information to use in countering the messages of brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and in promoting the prescription of generic drugs,” but denied manufacturers’ sales representatives the right to use the same “prescriber-identifying information” “for marketing”). Because Section 26820 imposes a content- and speaker-based burden on protected expression that is, in practice, viewpoint-discriminatory, it is “‘presumptively invalid.’” Id. at 2667 (quoting R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 382, and concluding that “[a]s in previous cases, … the outcome is the same whether a special commercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied”).
2. Plaintiffs Are Likely To Prevail Because Section 26820 Fails The Central Hudson Test.
The Court’s analysis in Sorrell reflects the fact that the Court has cast doubt on whether Central Hudson should remain the controlling test for commercial speech restrictions. Thompson, 535 U.S. at 367-68 (collecting cases); Lorillard Tobacco, 533 U.S. at 554 (same); Greater New Orleans Broad. Ass’n, 527 U.S. at 197 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); 44 Liquormart, 517 U.S. at 510-14 (plurality opinion); id. at 517 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2653 (citing Central Hudson only once in the majority opinion, to support the proposition that “the State must show at least” the elements set forth by Central Hudson (emphasis added)). The Supreme Court has further stressed that “a blanket prohibition against truthful, nonmisleading speech about a lawful product” — such as the fact that handguns are available for purchase — is reviewed “with ‘special care,’ mindful that speech prohibitions of [that] type rarely survive constitutional review.” 44 Liquormart, Inc., 517 U.S. at 504 (plurality opinion) (citing Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566 n.9). But in any event, Section 26820 fails even the scrutiny set forth under Central Hudson.[10]
Under Central Hudson, the reviewing court first inquires “whether the expression [being restricted] is protected by the First Amendment,” which means that “it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.” Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566. Second, the state must show that the “asserted governmental interest is substantial.” Id. Then, “[i]f both inquiries yield positive answers,” a court “must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.” Id.
The direct advancement prong, in particular, requires that the government advance its goals “in a permissible way,” specifically by not operating based on “the ‘fear that people would make bad decisions if given truthful information.’” Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2670 (quoting Thompson, 535 U.S. at 374). And the “not more extensive than is necessary” prong reflects the view that, “[i]f the First Amendment means anything, it means that regulating speech must be a last — not first — resort.” Thompson, 535 U.S. at 373.
a. Section 26820 Bans Protected First Amendment Activity.
The first step of Central Hudson is satisfied: Section 26820 imposes a blanket ban against truthful and nonmisleading speech (onsite advertising) about a lawful activity (the purchase of handguns). 44 Liquormart, 517 U.S. at 504. And though Section 26820 imposes a blanket ban that targets all handgun advertisements — not just deceptive ones — it is worth noting that the advertisements for which Plaintiffs have been cited (pictures of handguns and a sign shaped like a revolver) were not misleading.
b. Whether Section 26820 Is Supported By A “Substantial State Interest” Remains Unclear.
Plaintiffs can only guess what governmental interest Section 26820 is intended to advance, though presumably the Defendants will identify the interest in its opposition to this motion, since the government bears the burden of justifying its speech ban. Thompson, 535 U.S. at 373; Edenfield, 507 U.S. at 770.
One possible government interest is preventing offense to those people who disapprove of handguns, and who do not wish to see handgun advertising in public places. But that “advertisements” might be “offensive … to those exposed to them” is “classically not [a] justification[] validating the suppression of expression protected by the First Amendment,” including advertising. Carey, 431 U.S. at 701. The Court has “specifically declined to recognize a distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech that would render [the] interest [in preventing offense to viewers] a sufficient justification for a prohibition of commercial speech.” Bolger, 463 U.S. at 71-72.
Another possible interest, which the remainder of this memorandum will address, is the government’s desire to decrease handgun ownership, presumably on the theory that this will decrease violence or other injury. Plaintiffs do not agree that decreasing handgun ownership will indeed reduce violence or injury, or that the desire to decrease handgun ownership is a permissible justification for government regulations following Heller. Nonetheless, even assuming the interest is substantial, Section 26820 fails the Central Hudson test.
c. The State Cannot Establish That Section 26820 Directly Advances A Legitimate Government Interest.
The third Central Hudson prong “requires that the speech restriction directly and materially advance the asserted governmental interest.” Greater New Orleans Broad. Ass’n, 527 U.S. at 188. In particular, a state’s “seek[ing] to achieve its policy objectives through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by certain speakers — that is, by diminishing [speakers’] ability to influence [listeners’] decisions,” Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2670, is unacceptable. “[T]he ‘fear that people would make bad decisions if given truthful information’ cannot justify content-based burdens on speech.” Id. at 2670-71. The Supreme Court has “rejected the notion that the Government has an interest in preventing the dissemination of truthful commercial information in order to prevent members of the public from making bad decisions with the information.” Thompson, 535 U.S. at 374. “The choice ‘between the dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available’ is one that ‘the First Amendment makes for us.’” Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2671 (citation omitted).
To the extent that Section 26820 aims to reduce handgun ownership by reducing handgun advertising, it does what the Supreme Court has condemned: it tries to prevent consumers’ supposedly “bad” but perfectly lawful “decisions” (the decisions to buy handguns), by denying them “truthful commercial information” about the availability of handguns. A state “may not seek to remove a popular but disfavored product from the marketplace by prohibiting truthful, nonmisleading advertisements.” Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2671; see also id. at 2670 (noting that the state did not “advance its [stated policy goals] in a permissible way” because it “[sought] to achieve its policy objectives through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by certain speakers”). “That the State finds expression too persuasive does not permit it to quiet the speech or to burden its messengers.” Id. at 2671. What is true of speech about pharmaceuticals is at least as true of speech about constitutionally protected products such as handguns. As a result, section 26820 would fail the Central Hudson based on this reason alone.
But beyond this, the government’s burden to show direct advancement of its interest “is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture; rather, a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.’” Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 555 (2001) (citation and internal brackets omitted); see also 44 Liquormart, 517 U.S. at 505 (state bears the burden of demonstrating that restriction will “significantly advance” the asserted governmental interest). “A regulation cannot be sustained if it ‘provides only ineffective or remote support for the government’s purpose,’ or if there is ‘little chance’ that the restriction will advance the State’s goal.” Lorillard Tobacco, 533 U.S. at 566 (quoting Edenfield, 507 U.S. at 770, and Greater New Orleans Broad. Ass’n, 527 U.S. at 193). See also 44 Liquormart, 517 U.S. at 507-08 (the government’s speculation concerning effectiveness of regulation “does not suffice when the State takes aim at accurate commercial information for paternalistic ends.”).
And “this requirement [is] critical; otherwise, a State could with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves justify a burden on commercial expression.” Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 487 (1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The desire to prevent offense to those who disapprove of handguns, or to make a symbolic statement against handgun ownership, would be possible examples of such inadequate objectives that may lurk behind a supposed public safety rationale.
It is hard to see how section 26820 “will in fact alleviate them to a material degree” any public safety harms that the government can identify. Indeed, plaintiffs remain free to post on-site advertisements for rifles and shotguns, and firearms dealers can advertise handguns online and in broadcast and print media.[11] The statute would even allow a dealer to hire someone to dress up as a revolver and stand on the public sidewalk or a major intersection, directing consumers to the store, since that would not be speech “in any part of the premises.” Yet the DOJ has required to Plaintiff Ten Percent Firearms to take down a sign shaped like a revolver, and has ordered Plaintiff Tracy Rifle to remove pictures of handguns — though the picture of a rifle can stay. The Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye at commercial speech restrictions that impose irrational distinctions that “permit[] a variety of speech that poses the same risks the Government purports to fear, while banning messages unlikely to cause any harm at all.” Greater New Orleans Broad. Ass’n, 527 U.S. at 195.
The Third Circuit reached a similar conclusion in Pitt News v. Pappert, where it struck down a law restricting alcohol advertising in publications directly targeted to college students. 379 F.3d 96, 107-09 (3d Cir. 2004). Then-Judge Alito explained that Pennsylvania’s law “applie[d] only to advertising in a very narrow sector of the media,” and the commonwealth failed to show that “eliminating ads in [a] narrow sector [of the media] will do any good” because students “will still be exposed to a torrent of beer ads on television and the radio, and they will still see alcoholic beverage ads in other publications” including other publications displayed on campus. Id. at 107. The same is true of Section 26820.
d. The State Cannot Demonstrate That Section 26820’s Ban Is Not More Extensive Than Necessary.
Section 26820 also fails the fourth and final step of the Central Hudson analysis, which asks “whether the speech restriction is not more extensive than necessary to serve the interests that support it.” Lorillard Tobacco, 533 U.S. at 556 (citation and quotation marks omitted). This step reflects the view that, “[i]f the First Amendment means anything, it means that regulating speech must be a last — not first — resort.” Thompson, 535 U.S. at 373. “[I]f the Government could achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict speech, or that restricts less speech, the Government must do so.” Id. at 371-72 (striking down a restriction on drug advertising; collecting cases); 44 Liquormart, 517 U.S. at 507 (plurality opinion) (striking down restriction on advertising the price of alcoholic beverages partly because “[i]t is perfectly obvious that alternative forms of regulation that would not involve any restriction on speech would be more likely to achieve the State’s goal”); Greater New Orleans Broad. Ass’n, 527 U.S. at 192 (“There surely are practical and nonspeech-related forms of regulation … that could more directly and effectively alleviate some of the social costs of casino gambling.”); Rubin, 514 U.S. at 491 (striking down restriction on displaying the alcohol content on beer labels partly based on the available alternatives “which could advance the Government’s asserted interest in a manner less intrusive to respondent’s First Amendment rights,” because those alternatives “indicate[] that [the law] is more extensive than necessary”).
Consistent with Supreme Court precedent, the Ninth Circuit has invalidated commercial speech regulations as overinclusive where enforcement of preexisting laws would serve its interest without burdening speech. Valle Del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 709 F.3d 808, 826-27 (9th Cir. 2013); Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, 657 F.3d 936, 950 (9th Cir. 2011) (applying time, place or manner test, but relying on commercial speech precedent); Project 80’s, Inc. v. City of Pocatello, 942 F.2d 635, 638 (9th Cir. 1991) (“restrictions which disregard far less restrictive and more precise means are not narrowly tailored”).
In Valle Del Sol, plaintiffs challenged an Arizona law barring in-street solicitation of day laborers, which the state claimed was justified by its interest in traffic safety. The Ninth Circuit held that the solicitation ban failed the fourth step of the Central Hudson test because Arizona could serve its interest without burdening speech by enforcing its existing traffic safety regulations and by enacting additional speech-neutral regulations. 709 F.3d at 826-27.
In reaching this conclusion, the appellate court quoted with approval its decision striking down a similar ordinance in Comite de Journaleros because “[t]he City has various other laws at its disposal that would allow it to achieve its stated interests while burdening little or no speech.” Id. at 826 (quoting Comite de Journaleros, 657 F.3d at 949). The Court explained that “[Comite de Journaleros] was based on the longstanding rule that, because restricting speech should be the government’s tool of last resort, the availability of obvious less-restrictive alternatives renders a speech restriction overinclusive.” 709 F.3d at 826. Other courts have likewise struck down onsite advertising limitations under Central Hudson, even when the advertisements were for sexually themed businesses, often citing the fourth prong as the decisive one. See, e.g., Passions Video v. Nixon, 458 F.3d 837, 842-44 (8th Cir. 2006) (striking down advertising restriction on adult-oriented businesses); Abilene Retail # 30, Inc. v. Six, 641 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1196-99 (D. Kan. 2009) (same; issuing preliminary injunction); ABCDE Operating, LLC v. Snyder, 2011 WL 3113797, *4 (E.D. Mich. 2011) (same).
Section 26820 fails the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test for these same reasons. Unlike when this speech restriction was passed 90 years ago, California now comprehensively regulates the purchase and sale of handguns. It could serve its interest by enforcing these existing laws and regulations, and, if such enforcement efforts prove insufficient, the Legislature can pass additional direct regulations (within constitutionally permissible boundaries). See Valle Del Sol, 709 F.3d at 826-27.
Or the State could take steps to address the asserted governmental interest that do not involve any restriction on speech. For example, if California is concerned about the danger of gun violence, it could conduct an educational campaign and promote responsible handgun use. As the Supreme Court noted in Lorillard Tobacco, “if [the government’s] concern is that tobacco advertising communicates a message with which it disagrees, it could seek to counteract that message with ‘more speech, not enforced silence.’” 533 U.S. at 586 (citation omitted); see also Linmark Assocs., 431 U.S. at 97 (highlighting availability of counterspeech); Sorrell, 131 S.Ct. at 2671 (citing Linmark).
California thus has ample alternative means to advance its interest without restricting speech. And because Section 26820 restricts more speech than “necessary” to accomplish its interests, the statute fails the Central Hudson test and thus violates the First Amendment.
B.Plaintiffs Will Be Irreparably Harmed In The Absence Of A Preliminary Injunction.
Plaintiffs are irreparably harmed by the enforcement of Section 26820. “Both [the Ninth Circuit] and the Supreme Court have repeatedly held that ‘[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’” Klein v. City of San Clemente, 584 F.3d 1196, 1207-08 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)); Valle Del Sol, 709 F.3d at 828 (quoting Elrod, and upholding preliminary injunction in the commercial speech context). Furthermore, “‘constitutional violations cannot be adequately remedied through damages and therefore generally constitute irreparable harm.’” Stormans, Inc. v. Stelecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1138 (9th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).[12] “[P]urposeful unconstitutional suppression of speech constitutes irreparable harm for preliminary injunction purposes.” Goldie’s Bookstore, Inc. v. Super. Ct., 739 F.2d 466, 472 (9th Cir. 1984).
In addition, Plaintiffs Tracy Rifle and Baryla face the direct threat of forfeiting the dealership’s license if they do not take corrective action and remove the handgun advertisements before February 11. The loss of a business license as a direct consequence of exercising First Amendment rights constitutes irreparable injury. Legend Night Club v. Miller, 637 F.3d 291, 303 (4th Cir. 2011); Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 520-21 (4th Cir. 2002) (suspension of license and lost business opportunities constitute irreparable injury).
C.The Balance Of Equities Tips In Plaintiffs’ Favor.
The balance of equities tips in Plaintiffs’ favor “because they have a significant First Amendment and economic interest in engaging in [the prohibited] speech,” and California “need not impede that speech in order to pursue its” interests. Valle Del Sol, 709 F.3d at 828-29. If Section 26820 is not enjoined, Defendants will continue to enforce this unconstitutional law against Plaintiffs, who will be forced to choose between sacrificing their First Amendment rights and losing their property and livelihood (forfeiting their dealer’s license for noncompliance).
Conversely, an injunction would impose no burden on the Defendants. The administrative burden of compliance would be minimal (likely limited to communicating the fact that Section 26820 has been enjoined), and an injunction would pose no threat to public safety since California’s direct restrictions on the purchase and sale of handguns would remain unaffected. Finally, California is not harmed by an injunction preventing it from enforcing an unconstitutional statute. See, e.g., Legend Night Club, 637 F.3d at 302-03; Joelner v. Vill. of Wash. Park, 378 F.3d 613, 620 (7th Cir. 2004); New Jersey Retail Merchants Ass’n v. Sidamon-Eristoff, 669 F.3d 374, 388-89 (3d Cir. 2012).
D.An Injunction Is In The Public Interest.
The Ninth Circuit has “consistently recognized the ‘significant public interest’ in upholding free speech principles, as the ‘ongoing enforcement of the potentially unconstitutional regulations … would infringe not only the free expression interests of plaintiffs, but also the interests of other people’ subjected to the same restrictions.” Klein v. City of San Clemente, 584 F.3d 1196, 1208 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Sammartano v. First Judicial Dist. Ct., 303 F.3d 959, 974 (9th Cir. 2002)). Conversely, enforcement of an unconstitutional law is against the public interest. E.g., Scott v. Roberts, 612 F.3d 1279, 1297 (11th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he public, when the state is a party asserting harm, has no interest in enforcing an unconstitutional law.”); ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 590 (7th Cir. 2012) (“[T]he public interest is not harmed by preliminarily enjoining the enforcement of a statute that is probably unconstitutional.”); Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“[E]nforcement of an unconstitutional law is always contrary to the public interest.”); Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft, 322 F.3d 240, 251 n.11 (3d Cir. 2003) (“[N]either the Government nor the public generally can claim an interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law.”) (citation and international quotation marks omitted).
In fact, a preliminary injunction would promote the public interest by allowing for the free flow of commercial information, the value of which has been repeatedly recognized by the Supreme Court. E.g., Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 765 (1976) (“It is a matter of public interest that [consumer] decisions, in the aggregate, be intelligent and well informed.”); Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350, 364 (1977) (“[A] consumer’s concern for the free flow of commercial speech often may be far keener than his concern for urgent political dialogue.”); 44 Liquormart, 517 U.S. at 503 (plurality opinion) (“[C]ommercial speech bans not only hinder consumer choice, but also impede debate over central issues of public policy.”).
Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, the Court should issue a preliminary injunction that prevents Defendants from enforcing California Penal Code section 26820.
 
[1]See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 822 (1975) (striking down ban on abortion advertisements, partly because “the activity advertised pertained to constitutional interests,” citing Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)); Carey v. Population Servs. Int’l, 431 U.S. 678, 700-01 (1977) (striking down ban on contraceptive advertisements, partly because “the information suppressed by this statute ‘related to activity with which, at least in some respects, the State could not interfere’” (citation omitted)); Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods., 463 U.S. 60, 69 (1983) (striking down ban on mailing contraceptive advertisements, partly because “advertising for contraceptives … relates to activity which is protected from unwarranted state interference”).
[2]The ability to obtain a handgun is central to a citizen’s ability to exercise the core guarantee secured by the Second Amendment: “the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.” District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 635 (2008); see id. at 628 (handguns are the “class of ‘arms’” “overwhelmingly chosen by American society for [the] lawful purpose [of self-defense]”); id. at 628-29 (handguns are “the most preferred firearm in the nation to ‘keep’ and use for protection of one’s home and family.”).
[3]Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 566-67 (2001); Linmark Assocs., Inc. v. Willingboro Twp., 431 U.S. 85, 93 (1977).
[4] In addition to Section 26820, many localities, which key their firearm licensing regulations to the State’s, also impose similar on-site handgun advertising prohibitions. E.g., San Joaquin Cnty. Code of Ordinances § 7-1251(d) (“No pistol or revolver, or imitation thereof, or placard advertising the sale or other transfer thereof, shall be readily seen from the outside.”).
[5] The handguns depicted are a Nighthawk Customs GRP Recon .45 ACP, a Smith and Wesson 642 .38 Special, and a Glock 42 .380 ACP. The rifle is a Larue Tactical PredatOBR 5.56.
[6] Ten Percent Firearms and Morris were cited for violating former Penal Code section 12071(b)(4), which has since been renumbered as Section 26820.
[7] Specifically, the law banned pharmacies and insurers from selling, and pharmaceutical manufacturers and marketers from relying on, data about a doctor’s prescription practices (so-called “prescriber-identifying information”) for marketing purposes, without first having the doctor’s consent. Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2559-60.
[8] The Court also emphasized the importance of the free flow of commercial information “in the fields of medicine and public health, where information can save lives.” Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2664. This observation is equally applicable here. Indeed, the very essence of the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller — the right to use handguns for self-defense in the home — is that handguns “can save lives” as well.
[9] Of course, banning rifle or shotgun advertisements would also be unconstitutional.
[10] As noted above, several Justices have expressed concern that Central Hudson is not a stringent enough a test, but the Court has declined to “break new ground” because each of the challenged restrictions failed whether the Court applied Central Hudson or a more restrictive standard. Greater New Orleans Broad. Ass’n, 527 U.S. at 184; Lorillard Tobacco, 533 U.S. at 554-55; Thompson, 535 U.S. at 368.
[11] That firearms dealers have alternate avenues to advertise handguns does not save the constitutionality of Section 26820. Retailers have a particular interest in on-site advertising that communicates to passersby the products and services they offer. See Lorillard Tobacco, 533 U.S. at 565-67; Linmark Assocs., 431 U.S. at 93.
[12] The State will presumably argue in favor of Section 26820’s ban based on the theory that onsite advertising of handgun sales will result in marginally more sales of handguns. While plaintiffs need not show financial harm in order to show irreparable harm when their First Amendment rights are being infringed, supra, the State’s very rationale for the law, if true, establishes such financial harm.

Data is Ubers business. But protecting it may be its biggest weakness.By Nancy Scola and Andrea Peterson November 18 Follow @nancyscola Follow @kansasalps
(REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach)
Collecting and analyzing information on its drivers’ and riders’ movements is how Uber gets rides to appear in the right part of town at exactly the right time, which is precisely what many people love about the ride-hailing app.
But all that data gives the six-year-old company tremendous power. And a recent report may raise questions for consumers about how much they can trust the company with all that personal information. On that, Uber might have a tougher challenge than most, given the reputation it has accrued for playing to win at all costs.
An article from BuzzFeed this week alleged that an Uber executive floated the idea of hiring opposition researchers to dig up information on particularly critical journalists. But it needn’t have gone to such great lengths to get dirt -- its vast data stores might already contain that sort of insight. In fact, Buzzfeed also alleged that the general manager of Ubers New York City operations tapped into the user profile of one of its reporters, without the reporter’s permission, “to make points in the course of a discussion of Uber policies.”
It’s unclear exactly how much data and what kind may have been accessed by Uber's New York general manager. BuzzFeed wouldn’t comment further.
Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Post, but spokeswoman Nairi Hourdajian told Buzzfeed that "access to and use of data is permitted only for legitimate business purposes." These policies, she said, apply to all employees and the company regularly monitors internal access to that data.
But Uber, which has quickly grown from a start-up to a company worth $18 billion in 46 countries, is facing a challenge that has become common to almost every tech company: convincing the public that they’re protecting user data while, at the same time, harnessing it aggressively to deliver hyper-customized services. Uber has made a lot of enemies as it has grown -- among regulators, those in the taxi industry, and among the media. And this week's reports raise the specter of Uber having data on those critics, too.
Uber’s privacy policy , which users consent to when they download the app, seems to place few specific limits on what it can do with usage data. "We may use Usage Information for a variety of purpose [sic],” it reads, “including to enhance or otherwise improve the Services."
"It's a very broad privacy policy," says Jeffrey Chester, executive director for the Washington, D.C., based Center for Digital Democracy, giving the company “a sort of blanket use of data."
What the company does with the data has been a point of contention as Uber tries to set up shop in cities across the United States. Local officials argue that Uber’s refusal to share trip data means they can’t keep tabs on how the company is serving the public. On that point, Uber has been adamant. Last year, after the District demanded that Uber hand over its rider information, the firm's chief executive Travis Kalanick posted on the company blog , saying, “Tell Mayor Gray there will be no snooping on Uber’s trip data!”
But Ron Linton, Chairman of the D.C. Taxicab Commission, which has battled with Uber over data, says Uber’s stance is less about consumer privacy than it is about competitive advantage. “The greater part of their business plan,” says Linton, “is that they're going to amass the greatest database of consumer habits that the world has ever seen.”
Uber owns no cars and hires no drivers. In many ways, the whole company is a data play. Its systems know where you’ve come from, your favorite haunts and how you pay. The company’s “Math department,” as Kalanick calls it, collects user behavior over time into a “God view” that allows them to know exactly which neighborhood will need more cars on a rainy day.
Julia Horwitz, Consumer Protection Counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, says there are some positive aspects to Uber’s privacy policy, including how it breaks out procedures for sharing information with third parties. But the company, she says, also left itself with “room for interpretation.”
Uber has used demonstrations of its data-science savviness as a marketing tactic. In March of 2012, a blog post highlighted “ Rides of Glory ,” or late night weekend trips that were followed by with return trips a short time later. “I’m not pointing any fingers here or anything,” wrote Bradley Voytek, then a data scientist at Uber. But, he wrote, the data revealed that some riders “on occasion found love that you might immediately regret upon waking up the morning after.”
The company has advertised jobs that suggest at least some employees have access to user data at the individual level. A job posting for a Marketing Analytics Manager in DC counted mining data and analytics “at the rider level” to better understand usage behaviors among the job duties.
"Location data especially is in the zone of tension between consumers who feel that it’s just one more area where data is being collected on them and they're not sure how its being used,” says Lee Rainie, Director of the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. ”But at the same time they like the services afforded by these features,” like Uber’s detailed maps showing where the next car might be available.
Whether Uber has kept tight enough tabs on user data, especially on the rider level, is an on-going worry for some users. And there have been hints that the company has not guarded users’ privacy as closely as riders may have liked.
Earlier this year, entrepreneur and writer Peter Sims alleged that the company displayed his real time location in an Uber vehicle to the crowd at a 2011 launch party for the service in Chicago -- writing in a Medium post that he received a text from an attendee detailing his location down to the cross streets, though some other attendees at the party did not recall that aspect of the evening.
The minutiae of people's’ online activities are being collected by many companies they use everyday, like Google and Facebook. And consumers increasingly appear concerned about the vast amount of information private companies know about them.
A recent survey from the Pew Research Center showed that 91% of adults believe that consumers have “lost control” over how personal information is collected and used by private companies.
But the move to mobile is connecting the dots between our online and real world locations and activities.
In the early days of the Internet, location didn't really factor in to the online equation said Pew’s Rainie -- people "felt placeless online." Now times have changed.
“With mobile, location is at the center of the story -- there's a brand new layer that is baked into every kind of digital engagement and people are just beginning to understand what that means," Rainie says.
"There's a data gold rush frenzy to harness people's location -- it's almost a last hurdle,” added the Center for Digital Democracy’s Jeffrey Chester.
Geolocation data can be used to paint incredibly intimate portraits of where people work, where they live, who they socialize with, and even which medical conditions they may have. For instance, if a person is making routine visits to specific clinics, observers could infer that the user is struggling with a drug addiction or battling a disease like AIDS, says Horwitz.
This level of intimacy is one of the reasons geolocation data can be an incredibly valuable commodity, especially combined with other data gleaned about users online activities. “They've merged online and offline -- they want to continue their tracking into your real world experience," Chester says.
"This is so deeply tied to the trust issue,” Rainie said of the claims that a Buzzfeed reporter’s data was accessed by an employee without her permission. “Consumers know there are these organizations that are collecting data and they're just not sure that what the companies say is going to be true is actually the final word."
Consumers are aware rogue employees or just people who have access to data don't necessarily follow all the right protocols, he says.
But Chester thinks consumers are increasingly not able to choose if they want to be wrapped up on the data collection at the heart of many emerging tech industries. “It's not a matter of trust, the public has no choice because companies like Google and Uber and others have created a big data business model that collects 24/7 everything we and our friends do,” says Chester. “It's a massive data collection system where our information is and sold to the highest bidder.”
In August, Uber hired Obama advisor David Plouffe to run an “Uber the candidate” campaign to win the company’s political battles around the country. Now Plouffe has to contend with a growing public impression that the company is willing to engage in Nixonian dirty tricks.

Airport crowding hitting painful peakWhen everyday at the airport feels like Wednesday before Thanksgiving
Crowded terminal
Antonio Perez, Chicago Tribune
Travelers have their patience tested while dealing with long waits and flight cancelations at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on January 2, 2014.

Air Transportation Thanksgiving Air Transportation Industry O'Hare International Airport American Airlines
Do airports seem more crowded? Get used to it, a travel group says.
Crowding at large U.S. airports, including those in Chicago, is reaching dire levels as congestion during peak times on regular weekdays nears that typically seen during the Thanksgiving period, a travel industry group said Tuesday.
Annual growth of traffic, about 2 percent per year, doesn't seem dramatic, but many large airports are already near capacity during peak travel times,making them feel like the busiest travel day of the year — the Wednesday before Thanksgiving — according to the U.S. Travel Association, which released its "Thanksgiving in the Skies" report Tuesday.
Chicago O'Hare is the worst airport in America for winter travelers who want to be on time and avoid crowds, according to a new report released Tuesday. ( Gregory Karp )
However, an airline industry spokeswoman poked fun at the comparison to Thanksgiving travel.
"No one builds a church based on Easter Sunday crowds, and nor should we build airports for Wednesday before Thanksgiving traffic," said Jean Medina, spokeswoman for airline trade group Airlines for America. "We work cooperatively with airports to ensure we are meeting the needs of the traveling public in a way that will not add unnecessarily to the cost of travel."
The 30 airports in the study, which account for 70 percent of airplane passenger travel in 2013, will experience Thanksgiving-like congestionone day per week within the next six years, and along with it the hassle of more delays and cancellations, the association said.

"If you hate traveling around Thanksgiving because of the crowds and chaos, unfortunately we're well within sight of a time when it's going tobe like that every time you head to the airport," said U.S. Travel Association CEO Roger Dow.
The report, using data from Chicago-based Orbitz Worldwide, says Chicago's Midway Airport as of 2013 has one day a week that feels like the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and by next year, everyday will feel like that. O'Hare International Airport by 2018 will have one day a week that feels like the busiest day, the report said.
The trend in Chicago and elsewhere comes because "consumer demand for air travel continues to grow but investments in our air travel infrastructure have ground to a virtual halt," Dow said, adding that the consequences go beyond passenger hassle to include "our economy and jobs." Global trade associations, for example, might avoid hosting annual conventions in the U.S. because its airports are inferior, he said.
Airports' peak levels of congestion — typically on Mondays and Wednesdays for business travel and on Fridays for leisure travel — are happening more frequently, said Erik Hansen, senior director of policy at the travel association.
The headline should say, "every day," with a space between "every" and "day." "Everyday" is an adjective.

That will happen even more at O'Hare, where the airport's two largest airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines, have plans to rebank their flights in 2015, meaning they will group arrivals and departures, creating traffic peaks and valleys during the day. That makes for convenient connections but potentially puts pressure on the airport to handle high volumes of passengers. O'Hare has made a number of improvements in recent years inside the airport and out, opening a new runway last year with plans to open another next year. However, O'Hare and Midway continue to rank among the worst large airports for on-time departures.
The travel group said it wants congressional action, including a hike in the $4.50 Passenger Facility Charge, which is added to the cost of each ticket and hasn't gone up since 2000, as well as investment inairports, security screening, runways, taxiways and the air traffic control system.
"The U.S. air travel system was once the envy of the world, but now there is not a single U.S. airport ranked in the top 25 worldwide," Dow said. "Majorinvestments in air travel infrastructure are desperately needed to restore service to even basic levels of adequacy, let alone cope with theexpected coming demand."
However, Medina noted that since 2008, the 29 largest airports have started or completed more than $52 billion in capital projects, including new runways and new and renovated airport terminals.
Airlines don't support raising the passenger facility charge, Medina said, noting that from 2000 to 2012 airport revenues grew by nearly 60 percent, while passenger and cargo airline departures declined 12 percent.
Moreover, travel projections do not warrant the increase, she said.
The Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement it favors raising the Passenger Facility Charge "to undertake airport construction projects that enhance capacity and efficiency."
"Increasing demand is a good thing, but more must be done to modernize U.S. airports and the national airspace system — and reform the way the aviation system and airports are financed," the Aviation Department said.

5 fun features at Verizon s new Mag Mile store0
•Shoppers can create custom smartphone cases using images from their own social media pages or take a fresh one in an adjacent photo booth with a green screen. A retro pneumatic tube sucks the case up to the second floor for production, where it is ready in about 45 minutes.
•At a testing area for fitness bands and smartwatches, shoppers can pedal on a stationary bike or walk or run on a self-propelled treadmill adorned with "experience monitors" that immerse them in a city or neighborhood of their choice using Google Street View. The same area has a station to measure your vertical jump and a soccer net in which to kick the Adidas "smart" soccer ball.
•An "interactive focal wall" invites customers to play on a huge motion-sensor LED screen powered through Xbox Kinect, where they can participate in a series of virtual activities, including throwing a football, playing guitar and hang gliding.
•At a zone called "Have Fun," one of six "lifestyle zones" in the store, shoppers can practice flying a small Parrot drone.
•A pizza truck dubbed Magnificent Deep Dish, which showcases point-of-sale systems for small businesses, is among several design details meant as a nod to Chicago. Signage on the stairs and elevator are made to resemble CTA platforms.
The Verizon store has plenty of practical areas, too. Various touchscreens pull up device specs or pricing plans to help customers compare options side-by-side. An education area holds at least two classes daily on topics such as how to use an Android phone or iOS 8.

The Everygirl helped design an English roll-arm sofa on wooden casters called "Rose" — not to be confused with existing sofas on the site with names such as "Asher," "Henry" or "Russell" — that became Interior Define's best-selling sofa after it launched in September, said Rob Royer, co-founder and creative director of Interior Define, which launched this year.
"They have a big following so people trust their taste and the audience got excited about it," Royer said.
The Everygirl co-founder Alaina Kaczmarski said she and her partner, Danielle Moss, have no experience designing furniture, but they do know what styles they like — and what their audience likes. They surveyed their readers — they have 500,000 unique readers a month — to determine the preferred color, fabric and shape, and created sofas to appeal to 20-something women living in small city apartments.
The Everygirl, founded two years ago to be a resource for young women on topics ranging from career paths to apartment decor to romance, spotlights design that is attainable, affordable and stylish, so the partnership with Interior Define, which keeps its price points low because it doesn't have stock or warehouses, made sense, Kaczmarski said.
The Rose retails for $1,500 including shipping.
Interior Define, which previously collaborated with Chicago interior designer Alison Victoria, host of DIY Network's "Kitchen Crashers," on a line of chairs and sofas, plans to announce additional partnerships next year, said co-founder and CEO Steve McClearn.
The company, which counts Bonobos CEO Andy Dunn as a board member, in September closed $2 million in a round of seed funding, surpassing its goal of raising $1 million to $1.5 million, McClearn said.

Why Larry Summers sees danger ahead for the economyBy Lori Montgomery November 18 Follow @loriamontgomery

Like British Prime Minister David Cameron, Larry Summers sees warning lights flashing on the world's economic dashboard. Summers, who served through 2010 as President Obama's top economic adviser and was Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton, said America should be acting now to shore up its economy, instead of celebrating its status as the healthiest patient in the global economic sick ward.
For starters, Summers said in an interview Tuesday: We should invest in public infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. Including oil pipelines.
Does that include the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline, a project that the Senate is voting on Tuesday -- and one that has drawn little enthusiasm from the White House?
Yes, he said. "I suspect we should do the Keystone pipeline if it is still the relevant pipeline -- which is very much in doubt.  We certainly should not stand in the way of the Keystone pipeline," Summers said. "We should be trying to use this moment to maximize use of our energy resources."
Summers has voiced support for Keystone before, including in a September speech at the Brookings Institution. But building oil pipelines isn't the only thing Summers thinks we should be doing. We should be lifting decades-old restrictions on energy exports, he said, and building up our ports to handle the traffic. We should be updating an air traffic control system that, he said, "runs on vacuum tubes."
"There is an enormous amount of work that needs doing," Summers said, to "put people to work in the short run and raise the efficiency of the economy in the medium and the long run."
"What we need is a focused a growth strategy that recognizes the importance of generating healthy demand rather than a strategy that either accepts the lack of demand or tries to generate demand by driving down interest rates beyond extraordinary lows," Summers said.
When told that he sounds frustrated with both Democratic policymakers and Republican ones, Summers said: “That was the way I intended to sound.”
For at least a year -- long before Cameron warned of another looming economic disaster in Monday's Guardian newspaper -- Summers has been ringing alarm bells about the need for national governments, including the U.S. government, to prop up demand and stimulate economic activity.
With Europe stagnant, China cooling and Japan, Russia and Brazil dogged by recession, Summers -- who removed himself from the running for Federal Reserve chairman last year -- argues that we should forget about the national debt and start taking advantage of abnormally low interest rates to borrow and spend on worthwhile investments that will boost growth now and in the future.
That idea is unlikely to gain much traction on Capitol Hill, where resurgent Republicans are still focused on cutting spending. But Summers says we should be doing other things, too, such as promoting immigration and overhauling the business tax code, ideas with bipartisan support.
Why? Because, he warns,  if Europe falls into the same kind of prolonged slump that has plagued Japan for the past 20 years -- a real possibility, economists say -- America's ability "to maintain enough demand to support the global economy will be very much in doubt."
Japan, which slipped back into its fourth recession in six years on Monday, hasn't had "a moment of dramatic crisis," Summers said. Instead, it's had a generation of "prolonged sluggish and disappointing performance. And that's the risk that may be ahead for large blocs of the global economy."
"We should be thinking about every way in which we could constructively increase demand," Summers said. "It's hardly the moment to have unprecedentedly high levels of regulation over efforts to build energy pipelines or to build out the broadband infrastructure."
With interest rates at 2.5 percent and unemployment in the construction industry in the double digits, Summers said, "if that's not the moment to fix John F. Kennedy [International] Airport, I don't know what is."

Pentagons pugnacious critic on religion gets his day in CongressBy Dan Lamothe November 18 Follow @danlamothe
As the United States sent tens of thousands of troops to Afghanistan in 2010, a controversy erupted: the rifles they were carrying had coded scopes engraved with biblical references. In the war against the Taliban, already religiously charged,  it was akin to tossing a match on gasoline in the ongoing fight over where religion should fit into military life.

The incident followed a script for the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, the activist organization that exposed the issue. Service members registered their complaint about the so-called “Jesus rifles.” Mikey Weinstein, its founder, distributed the information widely through the media, expressing outrage. And then the government responded, with some officials defending the practice while others — including Gen. David Petraeus, then the top commander in Afghanistan — called it problematic.
The scope’s maker, Trijicon, eventually promised that it would stop using biblical references, and the military said it would work to alter rifles already in service. They were inscribed with phrases like “PSA91:5,” short for Psalms 91:5: “Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day.”
It was one of several victories by Weinstein over the military about how religion will be handled in the ranks. His pugnacious style, vigorous public relations efforts and aggressive fund-raising have earned praise from some — but also made him a target for those who say he is capitalizing on political correctness to get rich and exaggerating problems.
On Wednesday, Weinstein will get one of his largest stages yet: An appearance before the House Armed Services Committee’s subcommittee on military personnel . Weinstein, along with several other witnesses, will testify before Congress on the military’s current policy for religious accommodation, which requires Sikhs to seek a waiver from top service officials to wear their religion’s mandatory turbans and beards.
Weinstein intends to stretch the conversation beyond that, though, he said. He plans to tell Congress that numerous leaders in the military practice a “twisted version of Christianity” that oppresses not only Muslims and other religious minorities, but Christians who are not devout.
“If they intend to try to shoot the messenger, to assassinate the messenger, I couldn’t care less about that,” Weinstein said Tuesday. “To me, this is about the U.S. Constitution. They will not assassinate the message, and the message is that tens of thousands of our brave members of the U.S. military are being persecuted by a version of Christianity, a twisted version, that is the closest thing to the American, Christian version of the Islamic Taliban.”
Weinstein, who has not appeared before Congress previously, said the foundation will celebrate its 10th anniversary in about two weeks. It has grown to include nearly 40,000 members, 96 percent of whom are Christian, he said. The other 4 percent are from various faiths — there are even about 12 members who subscribe to Jedism, a religious movement based on the ideas in the “Star Wars” movie franchise.
Weinstein said he founded the organization after growing angry with the way his sons were treated while attending the Air Force Academy following the release of Mel Gibson’s 2004 movie “The Passion of the Christ.” His sons objected to the way the movie was advertised on campus, and were subjected to anti-Semitic slurs because of it from evangelicals on campus, he said. He sued the academy , alleging that cadets also were coerced into attending Christian events on campus.
A study of the religious climate at the academy eventually found numerous examples of intolerance, insensitivity and inappropriate proselytizing, but said  that the school was not overtly discriminatory. Weinstein, however, has continued to pounce on similar issues across the military for the last decade.
His actions have led to plenty of critics. Rep. Walter B. Jones, R-N.C., objected strongly last year after hearing a report that Weinstein had met with U.S. generals to offer advice on religious tolerance, and would consider court-martialing chaplains who professed their faith to others in the ranks.
“The work of military chaplains is essential to the well-being of our men and women in uniform,” Jones said at the time. “Threatening them with a court-martial for doing their job would be a disservice to all members of the armed forces. It is appalling that this administration is allowing an individual with such a history of threatening religious freedom to help shape policies for military personnel.”
Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R.-Kansas, also expressed frustration that the Obama administration had met with Weinstein, calling him a “notorious anti-Christian zealot who says the military ranks are full of Christian fundamentalist monsters whose evangelizing constitutes ‘spiritual rape,’ ‘a national security threat,’ and sedition and treason.’
The conservative Family Research Council also piled on, chronicling numerous attempts by Weinstein’s foundation to stop certain forms of religious expression in the military in a report released this year and titled “A Clear and Present Danger: The Threat to Religious Liberty in the Military.”
Weinstein also is derisively called an atheist on many online forums, but is actually a “Jagnostic,” he said — an agnostic Jew.
There’s also the money issue. An Air Force Times article earlier this year zeroed in on Weinstein’s income . In 2012, Weinstein received total compensation worth $273,355, or nearly half of all the money his organization earned that year, the newspaper reported. That is significantly more than top executives for other military non-profit organizations of similar size, but Weinstein said his donors and fellow board members have no problem with it.
The other witnesses testifying Wednesday are from the Family Research Council, the Liberty Institute, and the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty. Bruce Kahn, a rabbi and retired Navy chaplain, also will appear. Kahn has said previously that most military officials oppose proselytizing, while the other organizations have called repeatedly for politicians to stay out of religious issues in the military.
“If it’s contentious, it’s contentious,” Weinstein said of the hearing. “It’s not supposed to be UFC fight or a World Wrestling Entertainment event. It’s a congressional hearing. But, we’ll see how it goes.”

ADM picks oilseed executive to lead ingredients companyADM picks oilseed executive to lead ingredients company
Reuters
Archer Daniels Midland Company Patricia Woertz
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co said on Tuesday it has plucked another executive from its core oilseeds operations for a top spot in its expanding ingredients business.
Chicago-based ADM, one of the world's largest agricultural trading houses, named Ken Campbell, who was vice president of North American Oilseeds, as president of healthy ingredients company Specialty Commodities Inc.
0
ADM on Tuesday completed a $191 million deal to acquire Specialty Commodities, which buys, processes and distributes nuts, fruits, seeds and other products. The firm was majority owned by Goldner Hawn Johnson & Morrison, a private equity investment firm.
Campbell, through an ADM spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed. She said she did not know who would replace him in the oilseeds unit.
The management change illustrates the emphasis ADM is placing on growing its ingredients business as it tries to improve returns and is the latest shake-up in leadership at the agribusiness company.
Last month, ADM named Greg Morris, who oversaw all North American oilseeds processing, as president of its new Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit, which will include Specialty Commodities. ADM is creating the unit as part of this year's $3 billion acquisition of natural flavorings firm Wild Flavors.
Morris also had led ADM's specialty products business.
ADM on Nov. 4 reported that adjusted third-quarter earnings jumped 72 percent as gains in corn processing and agricultural services more than offset flat results in oilseed processing. However, revenues fell from a year earlier and missed Wall Street estimates.
Operating profits for oilseeds processing in the nine months ended Sept. 30 were $1 billion, up 2.8 percent from the same period the previous year.
ADM is increasing its focus on ingredients ahead of the departure of Chief Executive Patricia Woertz. Earlier this month, the company said she will step down at the end of the year and be replaced by Juan Luciano, chief operating officer and president.

Conservative solutions to racism and sexismBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 18 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg

On Friday Nov 14, Taylor offered an unsolicited apology about his shirt “I made a big mistake and I offended many people,” he said. “And I’m very sorry about this.” (AP Photo/ESA)
Last week, after the European Space Agency managed to set its Philae lander down on Comet 67P, the organization’s accomplishment was marred by a serious fashion faux-pas. Matt Taylor, one of the physicists on the project, decided that the best outfit for his interview was a truly ugly bowling shirt in a busty-lady print. In a previous era, he might simply have been derided as a tasteless dork. But in this one, Taylor got caught up in a debate about how receptive the science and technology industries are to women.
I agree with people who found Taylor’s fashion choice jarring, and I feel for Taylor in his obvious embarrassment and regret.  But most of all, the incident clarified something for me. I may not sympathize with conservative analyses of sexism and racism. But when it comes to identifying potential solutions to bad behavior, conservatives are right to zero in on good manners as a potential solution.
In writing about the name of Washington’s professional football team last year, Charles Krauthammer explained that for him , adapting to changing linguistic norms for how to refer to everyone from Roma to people with intellectual disabilities, was a matter of politeness and kindness more than anything else.
“Let’s recognize that there are many people of good will for whom ‘Washington Redskins’ contains sentimental and historical attachment — and not an ounce of intended animus. So let’s turn down the temperature,” he argued. “What’s at issue is not high principle but adaptation to a change in linguistic nuance. A close call, though I personally would err on the side of not using the word if others are available.”
Krauthammer was making a point that is absent from many of our conversations about language. Rather than treating Native American advocates as people who are trying to take something valuable away from him, Krauthammer acknowledges that listening to them and complying with their requests costs him very little.
And rather than suggesting that people who hold onto the name are malign racists, Krauthammer is charging them with failures of empathy and courtliness. These are still serious accusations, but perhaps it is easier to discuss whether someone has bad manners or is inconsiderate than whether or not they are a wholly bad person.
I feel similarly about Rich Lowry’s response to the now-viral Hollaback! video that showed a woman being harassed on the streets of New York. I disagree with his conclusion that such harassment has little to do with sex, class and race.
But, like other commentators on the right and left who worry about the overcriminalization of annoying, inappropriate behavior, I agree with him that an anti-harassment law would be difficult and probably counterproductive to enforce. And while I also think that his proposed solution–better manners for everyone–is a heavy lift, too, I think it is a better one.
“This is no excuse for catcalling. There is no reason to shout at random women — ever. There is no reason to comment on a stranger’s personal appearance — ever. There is no reason to go out of your way to make someone else feel uncomfortable on the street — ever,” Lowry wrote. “These are things that used to be self-evident to the gentleman, who not only wouldn’t holler at a woman, but, once upon a time, opened doors for her and yielded his seat to her. The gentleman was a product of culture…No legal regime can substitute for the web of informal rules and private institutions, family foremost among them, that are civilization’s tried and true methods of inculcating standards.”
And so the solution to Matt Taylor’s exceptionally ugly shirt is not to make him a scapegoat. The guy, like one of the developers caught up in last year’s Donglegate uproa r, seems genuinely contrite and aware of why his wardrobe choice was a poor one. Instead, maybe we could take up a collection to buy Taylor a good suit and a couple of well-fitting dress shirts. He may have missed the opportunity to look sharp and professional on what might be the biggest day of his career. But there will be other moments for Taylor to treat big occasions–and himself–with the respect that they deserve.

Cost to Treat Ebola in U.S.: $1 million for 2 patientsBy Lena H. Sun November 18 Follow @bylenasun

It cost more than $1 million to treat two Ebola patients at the Nebraska Medical Center, said Jeffrey Gold, chancellor of the hospital’s academic partner.
That’s the direct cost of providing the care, Gold said Tuesday during a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee. It doesn’t include the opportunity cost of taking those 10 beds out of service, which he estimated was close to $148,000 so far.
“It’s about $30,000 per day per patient,” Gold said. For the first two patients, the average length of stay was 18 days. The third patient, Martin Salia , arrived at the Nebraska hospital on Saturday afternoon and died early Monday.
The first two Ebola patients were covered by private insurance. Hospital spokesman Taylor Wilson said the hospital is expecting to be reiumbursed.
“Insurance has not let us know what, if anything it will cover for these patients, so we haven’t received anything in the way of payment yet,” Wilson said in an e-mail.
In his testimony, Gold urged Congress to approve funding for full reimbursement of the cost of care “for these unique cases that are not recoverable from insurance policies.”
The Nebraska hospital is one of four facilities in the country that have special biocontainment units, designed in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to protect against bioterrorism. The others are Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, the clinical center at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda and St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Mont.
A spokeswoman for Emory, which has treated four Ebola patients, declined to provide information about costs. Gold said Monday that Nebraska’s costs of care “are not that far apart from Emory.”
The NIH clinical center, the nation’s only hospital dedicated to research, provides free state-of-the-art care to very sick patients from all over the world. Officials estimate the cost at about $50,000 per day to care for Dallas nurse Nina Pham, or about $400,000 for the eight days she was there.  St. Patrick’s has not yet cared for an Ebola patient.

Missouri Gov. swears in Ferguson panel ahead of grand jury decision in shootingBy Wesley Lowery and Emily Wax-Thibodeaux November 18 Follow @WesleyLowery Follow @emily_wax
Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon swore in the members of an independent commission formed to investigate issues raised by the shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson. (Reuters)
FERGUSON, Mo. —As the state and the nation await a verdict in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, Gov. Jay Nixon announced Tuesday that he’s selected a black minister and a white businessman to lead an independent commission in response to the sustained outrage after the death.
“They are tough, they are smart and they are empowered,” Nixon said of the 16-member panel. “They are also independent.”
The announcement came a day after Nixon activated the National Guard and declared a state of emergency in preparation for possible fallout to a grand jury decision as the St. Louis metro area braces for the expected news that Wilson will not be charged in the Aug. 9 shooting of Brown , 18.
The shooting led to weeks of unrest in August, some of it violent. The area is hoping to prevent a repeat of those difficult days but has spent weeks bracing for the worse. The grand jury decision could be announced within days.

The commission will be co-chaired by the Rev. Starsky Wilson, who has been active in the protests and is well-known in regional philanthropic circles, and Rich McClure, a prominent member of the St. Louis business community. The panel consists of five black men, four black women, five white men and two white women.
The panel’s charge is a “thorough, wide-ranging and unflinching study” of the underlying social and economic conditions that helped fuel  the sometimes violent protests, Nixon said last month when he announced plans for a commission.
“These are issues that run deep in our community, and deep in our country,” Nixon told reporters after appointing the commission members. “Clearly we live in a society where there are existing inequalities. This presents us with the opportunity to address (them) maturely but aggressively.”
The co-chairmen said they plan to use the commission to probe the city/county government structure — which, in the months since Brown’s death, observers have often pointed to as a source of many of the systemic inequities in the region.
Among the others named to the commission are Dan Isom, a former police chief who is currently the director of the state department of safety; Grayling Tobias, a local school superintendent; and Kevin Ahlbrand, president of the Missouri State Fraternal Order of Police.
Protest leaders also praised the selection of the Rev. Traci Blackmon, Teach for America executive director Brittany Packnett and 20-year-old Rasheen Aldridge  – all of whom had been active in the protests.
“Protesting got us here, protesting got us a commission,” Aldridge said. “This is about making sure there isn’t another Mike Brown.”
The panel has until September 2015 to issue policy recommendations, but also has the option of issuing recommendations on a rolling basis.

Do you need an actively managed fundDo you need an actively managed fund?
By Elliot Raphaelson, Tribune Content Agency, The Savings Game
Retirement Retirement Planning Finance
Not all experts agree whether actively managed funds can outperform index funds. Some do in the short term, but it is certainly not easy to select actively managed funds that will outperform index funds in the long term.
An index fund manager buys all of the securities of a specific index, such as the S&P 500, or at least a representative sample. The objective is to track the index' performance as closely as possible. Index funds are commonly described as "passively managed." An actively managed fund, by contrast, is one in which the manager selects individual securities in an effort to outperform specific indexes.
One of the most important factors to consider is the annual cost associated with an actively managed fund you are considering in comparison to the annual cost of the indexed mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) you are comparing it to. Morningstar has done extensive research in this field and has pointed out that the annual cost of the fund is one of the best predictors of long-term performance.
0
What follows is a comparison between the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) and the Dodge & Cox Stock Fund (DODGX). The Dodge & Cox fund is in the top performance echelon for long-term value funds. Morningstar gives it a four-star rating; in terms of trailing total returns, it's ranked No. 1 in three-year and 15-year returns. It has fairly consistently outperformed the S&P 500. If you chose this as your single managed stock fund, you can congratulate yourself for being an astute fund picker.
The Vanguard Total Stock Fund is also an excellent fund. It's a standard index fund of a large, well-known company. If you buy it, you won't exactly impress your friends for your originality (it has assets more than six times larger than the Dodge & Cox fund). However, you will be just as pleased by its performance. Let's compare.
Dodge & Cox Stock Fund (DODGX)
Expense Ratio: 0.52
Trailing total returns (according to Morningstar)
1-year: 13.47 percent
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)
Expense Ratio: 0.05
Trailing total returns (according to Morningstar)
1-year: 14.61 percent
5-year 15.66 percent
10-year 8.32 percent
An investment of $10,000 made 10 years ago would be worth $20,576.80 if you chose Dodge & Cox. It would be worth $22,233.13 if you chose the Vanguard fund. (Those figures are from Morningstar.)
There is no question that the Dodge & Cox fund is an excellent fund and is well managed. However, no actively managed fund can compete with index funds on a cost basis. Note the difference in expense ratios: 0.52 for the Dodge & Cox fund vs. 0.05 for the Vanguard fund. On a long-term basis, it becomes very difficult for any well-managed active fund to outperform an index fund in the same category.
Index funds also have one additional advantage over actively managed funds, specifically savings on income taxes. There will be more "turnover" in actively managed funds than there would be with index funds. For any investments other than retirement accounts, you will have more of a tax liability with actively managed funds because you will incur more capital gains taxes.
In my opinion, most investors will be better off in the long-run by investing the majority of their common stock investments in index funds. You can still diversify within index funds, investing in small-cap, mid-cap, large-cap, value and other types of index funds. You can do this with both mutual funds and ETFs, but you should limit your investments to those funds with the lowest expense ratios.
CLARIFICATION: In a recent column about working during retirement and its effect on Social Security benefits, I didn't clearly explain a special rule that applies if you are retiring mid-year.
You are entitled to a full Social Security check for any month or less if you:
--Are under the full retirement age for all of 2014, your earnings in the month are $1,290 and you did not perform substantial services in self employment.
--Reach full retirement age in 2014, and your earnings in the month are $3,450 or less, and you did not perform substantial services in self employment.
"Substantial services in self-employment" means devoting more than 45 hours a month to the business or between 15 and 45 hours to a business in a highly skilled occupation.

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty scale new highs on FII buyingAfter hitting new peak in the opening trade, Sensex succumbed to profit-booking and selling by foreign funds at record levels.
By: PTI | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 10:43 am | Updated: November 19, 2014 5:08 pm
The benchmark BSE Sensex today logged new lifetime high of 28,294.01 but retreated after a late fall gripped stocks to end 130 points down at 28,032.85, amid profit-taking in bluechips from metal, power and oil&gas space.
The BSE 30-share barometer, after hitting the new peak in the opening trade, succumbed to profit-booking and selling by foreign funds at record levels. At one point, it slipped below the 28,000-mark to touch the day’s low of 27,963.51.
The gauge settled 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, lower at 28,032.85. Yesterday, it had touched intra-day high of 28,282.85 but had ended with a loss of 14.59 points.
Major losers that pulled down Sensex and Nifty from record highs included Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite, GAIL, BHEL, Tata Motors, NTPC, Sun Pharma, ONGC, CIL, RIL and SBI.
Similarly, the NSE 50-scrip index Nifty after scaling a new peak of 8,455.65 at the outset, beating previous record of 8,454.50 touched yesterday, fell. It ended below the 8,400-mark to close with a loss of 43.60 points, or 0.52 per cent, at 8,382.30. Intra-day, it had touched a low of 8360.50.
Traders said besides profit-booking, a mixed trend in global markets ahead of the release of minutes of Federal Reserve policy meeting, led to the fall in Indian shares.
“Market remained in a very narrow range for most part of the trading session and corrected in the last 90 minutes of the trading session. Stocks that were top performing in the first half of the trading session, were the ones that corrected the most in the second half of the trading session,” said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.
The local currency also appeared to be having a bad day with rupee trading near 62-levels against the US dollar.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors sold shares worth Rs 101.98 crore yesterday, first net sales in almost 3 weeks.
Sectorally, the BSE Metal index suffered the most by losing 2.14 per cent, followed by Power index which fell 1.80 per cent, Oil & Gas index by 1.35 per cent, Consumer Durables by 1.22 per cent and Realty index by 0.99 per cent.
Selling activity also gained momentum in small and mid-cap sector stocks. The BSE Small-cap index lost 0.65 per cent and Mid-cap index fell 0.63 per cent.
Bucking the trend, Dr Reddy, HUL, HDFC, Bajaj Auto, Airtel, L&T, Infosys and ICICI Bank ended up.

Jeev hopes for a turnaround
PTI
golf
Struggling to revive the form which made him India’s top golfer, seasoned pro Jeev Milkha Singh has pinned his hopes of a turnaround on the USD one million Resorts World Manila Masters which tees off here on Thursday.
From being a top-50 player in the world, the two-time Asian Tour number one has fallen on hard times over the past two seasons but the 42-year-old believes he can haul himself back into the winner’s enclosure.
“It’s been about 20 years since I came back here (to the Philippines). I was only about 22 or 23 years old when I last played here. I’m glad to be back after so many years and it’s good to have the positive vibes and good memories from the last time I was here. I hope to build on those and play my best this week,” said Singh, who won the 1995 Philippine Classic and Asian Matchplay Championship.
Singh’s recent struggle is difficult to imagine as it was only two years ago that he won the prestigious Scottish Open for his third victory on European soil. He was also ranked as high as 35th in the world back in 2008, the year he became the Asian Tour’s Order of Merit champion for a second time with a record haul of USD 1.45 million in winnings.
But Singh believes he can regain his best form again as he did on two other occasions during his illustrious career which has suffered several peaks and troughs.
And with young compatriots Anirban Lahiri and Rashid Khan, both in their 20s, having won twice already this season on the Asian Tour, Singh said their success has only motivated him to work harder.
“The standard of golf has really improved in Asia. The young kids are hungry for success and they want to prove themselves. They are fearless and it’s just great to watch.
Seeing young kids like Rashid winning on Tour motivates me.
They push me to play well and I would like to do well to compete with them,” said Singh.
“My game’s feeling good. The only thing I need to work on is my driving. If it’s in place, I think I will have a good week.”
Singh marvelled at the prime condition of the Masters course at Manila Southwoods.
“The golf course is in a fantastic condition. I couldn’t remember the holes at all, except for the 18th hole, having not played here for such a long time. It’s amazing. The wind is going to be a strong factor on this course. If it picks up, it is going to be a great test of golf out there,” he said.

Boxers Pinki, Monica lose in World Women’s Championships

world championship
On a thoroughly disappointing day for Indian boxers at the World Women’s Championships, Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Pinki Rani (51kg) and Monica Saun (75kg) crashed out after losing their respective bouts here on Wednesday.
Pinki Rani, who came in for injured five-time World champion and Olympic bronze medallist M C Mary Kom, opened the proceedings for India in a second round contest.
The youngster from Haryana, who has shown promise, found the going tough against her Russian rival Saiana Sagataeva after displaying some spark in the opening two minutes.
The national champion managed to unsettle her rival for some time with a few hard hitting right jabs and precise blows to the body but failed to maintain the intensity as the bout progressed.
In a draining battle, Pinki lost steam much earlier than expected and was visibly slow in her movement after being knocked down once by Sagataeva in the second round.
Monica was next in the ring, taking on China’s Li Qian in her opening bout of the big event and went out without putting in much fight in a rather drab encounter.
Both the boxers spent the better part of the bout trying to get a measure of each other and shied away from attacking.
Qian, however, was more nimble-footed and was impressive on counter attack against her sluggish Indian rival.

Shares fall  dollar gains as economic outlooks diverge2
Italian government bond markets suffered, with yields shooting higher after S&P downgraded the country's credit rating to just one notch above junk on Friday, underscoring the limited progress made under Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's economic reforms. [GVD/EUR]
But all other euro zone borrowing costs fell, with benchmark German yields hitting a day's low after Nowotny said the bloc's tepid recovery had pushed the European Central Bank to look more closely at a sovereign bond quantitative easing program.
"Nowotny's comments have just reinforced the market's view that the ECB is inching towards outright QE, we think probably in January," said Lee Hardman, a strategist with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London.
DOLLAR POWER
The gathering strength of the dollar, against which the euro fell 0.2 percent to a 2-1/2-year low, also weighed heavily on emerging markets on Monday.
The rouble one of the headline losers, giving up 2 percent as it fell back towards record lows hit last week.
Symptomatic of problems affecting many developing markets, there are worries that Russia will jack up interest rates to as much as 12 percent this week in a bid to fend off a full-blown financial crisis.
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed down 0.25 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei was up 0.1 percent with the downward revision to Japan's GDP neutralizing much of the positive impact from a weaker yen. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.2 percent while Singaporean and Malaysian shares also dipped.
The Shanghai composite index gained 2.9 percent after the downbeat Chinese data added to hopes that China will implement more stimulus to shore up its economy.
Dariusz Kowalczyk, economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong, noted that the year-on-year drop in China's imports was the biggest since the Lehman crisis, barring the volatile Lunar New Year-related period.
"This is partly a reflection of lower commodity prices and base effects, but ...we have to assume that poor domestic demand has played a part. This means that pressure will rise on the government to do more to stimulate growth," he said.
The Australian and the New Zealand dollars, both sensitive to the economic fortunes of China, touched new 4-1/2 year and 2-1/2 year lows, respectively.
The disappointing Chinese and Japanese data contrasted sharply with Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls that showed employment in November surged by 321,000, easily topping forecasts for 230,000 new jobs.

Dollar firm as Fed minutes likely to highlight policy divergence with peers0
Sterling and the New Zealand and Australian dollars had been the main losers among major currencies early in Europe, both the Aussie and the kiwi hurt by trade numbers from China showing a sharp drop in imports and another 2 percent slide in oil prices.
Sterling and the Aussie recovered most of those losses, but the kiwi traded almost 0.9 percent lower by 0630 ET while Norway's crown - exceptionally sensitive to oil prices - dropped around half a percent against both the euro and dollar.
"With the kiwi, its more the move higher in U.S. yields than anything," said Hardman. "It's really a big story of dollar strength."
The Swiss franc, another very low yielding currency, fell to an 18-month low of 0.9818 francs per dollar.
TARGETED
Among big events for markets this week are the European Central Bank's second offer of targeted loans (TLTRO) to banks and speeches by a handful of U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of next week's final policy meeting of the year.
"The jobs numbers supported the dollar and we expect this trend to continue ahead of the Fed meeting as interest rate expectations continue to adjust," said Josh O'Byrne, a strategist with Citi in London.
Overall, the dollar was up another 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies. Dealers said the yen was supported by around $2 billion worth of options expiries at 121.50 yen per dollar, putting a cap on the dollar's strength.
Most major banks continue to predict further gains for the dollar against its major peers in 2015, although the surge past 120 yen has left some wondering how much juice there still is in the yen trade, at least for now.
There is also Japan's national election next Sunday, currently seen as likely to give a boost to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and reflationary policies which weaken the yen.
The euro fell to a low of $1.2247 after Nowotny's comments.
"We expect the euro to continue to weaken in the week ahead," analysts from French bank BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. "Another low TLTRO uptake could put some upside pressure on euro front-end rates. However, low demand would also increase the chances of an increase in asset purchases (by the ECB) early next year."

The benchmark Sensex on Wednesday logged new lifetime high of 28,294.01 but retreated after a late fall gripped stocks to end 130 points down at 28,032.85, amid profit-taking in bluechips from metal, power and oil and gas space.
The BSE 30-share barometer, after hitting the new peak in the opening trade, succumbed to profit-booking and selling by foreign funds at record levels. At one point, it slipped below the 28,000-mark to touch the day's low of 27,963.51.
The gauge settled 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, lower at 28,032.85. On Tuesday, it had touched intra-day high of 28,282.85 but had ended with a loss of 14.59 points.
Major losers that pulled down Sensex and Nifty from record highs included Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite, GAIL, BHEL, Tata Motors, NTPC, Sun Pharma, ONGC , CIL , RIL and SBI.
Similarly, the NSE 50-scrip index Nifty after scaling a new peak of 8,455.65 at the outset, beating previous record of 8,454.50 touched on Tuesday, fell. It ended below the 8,400-mark to close with a loss of 43.60 points, or 0.52 per cent, at 8,382.30. Intra-day, it had touched a low of 8360.50.
Traders said besides profit-booking, a mixed trend in global markets ahead of the release of minutes of Federal Reserve policy meeting, led to the fall in Indian shares.
"Market remained in a very narrow range for most part of the trading session and corrected in the last 90 minutes of the trading session. Stocks that were top performing in the first half of the trading session, were the ones that corrected the most in the second half of the trading session," said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.
The local currency also appeared to be having a bad day with rupee trading near 62-levels against the US dollar.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors sold shares worth Rs 101.98 crore on Tuesday, first net sales in almost 3 weeks.
Sectorally, the BSE Metal index suffered the most by losing 2.14 per cent, followed by Power index which fell 1.80 per cent, Oil and Gas index by 1.35 per cent, Consumer Durables by 1.22 per cent and Realty index by 0.99 per cent.
Selling activity also gained momentum in small and mid-cap sector stocks. The BSE Small-cap index lost 0.65 per cent and Mid-cap index fell 0.63 per cent.
Bucking the trend, Dr Reddy, HUL, HDFC, Bajaj Auto, Airtel, L&T, Infosys and ICICI Bank ended up.
Jignesh Chaudhary, Head of Research, Veracity Broking Services said: "Indian equities opened positively, but as the day progressed, the indices lost their way. Indices are trading near all time highs so investors preferred to stay cautious at these levels."
Overall, 22 out of 30 Sensex-based scrips ended with losses while others settled with gains.
Major losers from the Sensex pack include Tata Steel (3.08 per cent), Sesa Sterlite (2.75 per cent), Gail India (2.30 per cent), Tata Motors (2.29 per cent), BHEL (1.99 per cent), NTPC (1.94 per cent) and Sun Pharma (1.77 per cent).
ONGC (1.69 per cent), Coal India (1.58 per cent), Cipla (1.47 per cent), M&M (1.43 per cent) and Reliance Industries (1.01 per cent) also were among laggards.
However, Dr Reddy's Lab rose by 2.45 per cent, HUL 1.19 per cent, HDFC 1.01 per cent, Bajaj Auto 1.01 per cent and Bharti Airtel 0.89 per cent.
Among the S&P BSE sectoral indices, metal fell by 2.14 per cent, followed by power 1.80 per cent, oil & gas 1.35 per cent, consumer durables 1.22 per cent, realty 0.99 per cent, bankex 0.65 per cent and auto 0.64 per cent.

White House to further expand digital access in classroomsBy Katie Zezima November 19 Follow @katiezez
President Obama will announce Wednesday an expansion of an initiative to bring high-speed Internet connectivity to almost all of America's schools, recruiting superintendents to develop and implement sweeping plans to set up Internet infrastructure and tailor it to classroom needs.
Obama will announce the enlargement of ConnectED, a program announced last year, at a White House conference on digital learning, the White House said. The plan is part of a broader White House strategy to upgrade America's ever-changing Internet infrastructure as one would a system of aging highways or bridges. ConnectED, which Obama announced at a North Carolina school last year, aims to put high-speed broadband and wireless Internet in 99 percent of America's schools by 2017. The initiative involves a significant private-sector component; companies have committed more than $2 billion toward helping upgrade internet infrastructure in schools.
To achieve that goal, more than 1,200 superintendents will sign on Wednesday to implement technology in schools in their districts and work with educators in other school districts to help ground learning in technology. The superintendents will work to update broadband and wireless and infuse technology into the learning process, things that could include figuring out what types of devices to give students to helping teachers with ideas on how to teach through technology. The White House estimates the group will reach 10 million students across 16,000 schools nationwide.
Despite the ubiquity of technology, many schools throughout the country don't have the Internet speed or quality to support the type of technology that many students and educators use at home. In some schools, certain classrooms may not be connected. The Department of Education will distribute an infrastructure guide to help administrators map out the type of connectivity they need and how to get it into schools, and a toolkit to show educators examples of how technology is used in the classroom, helping them to customize lesson plans and goals.
"What it all means is we’re helping to demonstrate that American K-12 schools are at a tipping point and this is a movement that is overtaking the entire country," an Obama administration official said.
Private sector companies have donated $2 billion to ConnectED. The Federal Communications Commission boosted its investment in school and library Internet by $2 billion earlier this year, providing funding and discounts. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler Monday proposed that the cap on annual spending for Internet in schools be raised by $1.5 billion. Obama has asked Congress for $200 million in Fiscal Year 2015 to help fund the initiative. But school districts, many of them cash-strapped, will still have to find room in their budgets for technology.
The administration said that districts will still have to tailor their budgets to accommodate technology.
The Department of Education, in partnership with the Alliance for Excellent Education, plans to hold 12 regional summits to help educators introduce and use technology in schools.
Coursera, an online education company, will provide free professional development to teachers and allow them to earn certificates that can be used toward continuing education credits. And open online course provider EdX will provide free course certificate to teachers and high school students in schools that are determined to be high-need, as well as free access to online advanced placement courses.
"This is a really important reform because we know that the way in which our children are engaged and the skills they need relative to science, technology, engineering, math, the skills they need to be problem solvers and critical thinkers," the administration official said, "all of those demand a richer classroom environment and technology."

Rupee hits 7.5 mth low on dollar buying from oil firmsFOREX UPDATE: Rupee falls to over 8.5-mth low on dollar demand

The Indian rupee extended its losses for the fifth session in a row and ended at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96 against the Greenback on Wednesday following sustained dollar demand from oil importers and weakness in local stock market.
Slowdown in inflows also weighed on rupee that ended 22 paise lower while the dollar index was trading almost stable against its six major global rivals ahead of the release of the minutes of a key US Federal Reserve meeting.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the local currency commenced lower at 61.80 a dollar from previous close of 61.74 and immediately touched a high of 61.7850.
However, dollar demand pulled down the rupee as it fell back sharply to a low of 61.9950. It settled at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96, logging a drop of 22 paise or 0.36 per cent. This was its weakest closing since finishing at 62.04 on March 3, 2014. It had also logged intra-day low of 62.15 on March 4, 2014. Crude oil prices had fallen in the initial half of the day and prompted oil companies to speed up their greenback purchases also hurt sentiments.
Furthermore, a fall in local stocks triggered concerns of foreign fund outflows that also weighed on rupee, said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India. The rupee has weakened by 45 paise in five straight days.
In the stock market, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex tumbled by 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, after touching intra-day all-time peak of 28,294.01. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $2.44 million on Tuesday, as per Sebi data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group, said: Trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40.

Public helped us release Naa Bangaaru Talli:Director'Naa Bangaru Talli' won National Awards for best feature film, best background score and special mention for actress Anjali Patil.
By: Indo-Asian News Service | Chennai | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:40 pm
Filmmaker Rajesh Touchriver says it was the public’s contribution that facilitated the release of the three National Awards winning Telugu-Malayalam bilingual ‘Naa Bangaaru Taali’, which deals with human trafficking, in cinemas Friday.
Malayalam version of the film titled ‘Ente’ released recently to critical acclaim.
‘Naa Bangaru Talli’ won National Awards for best feature film, best background score and special mention for actress Anjali Patil.
“We struggled to release the film. The awards didn’t quite help us find a distributor. People liked the film but nobody was interested in releasing it. We needed Rs.15 lakh for the release, so we went for crowd-funding,” Touchriver told IANS.
Inspired from a true story, ‘Naa Bangaaru Talli’ also features Siddique and Ratha Sekhar Reddy.
The film has also made rounds to Trinity International Film Festival and Indonesian International Film Festival.

Hair salons do it, dry cleaners do it, and so do department stores selling health and beauty products. Now France wants to know why, for some goods and services, women seem to be paying more than men.
The question was first taken up by a group of French activists inspired by a study that found American women overpay hundreds of dollars a year for the same products. The activists persuaded the Economy Ministry this month to launch an in-depth study to determine what price differences exist in France, the reasons behind them and which sectors are most affected. Findings are expected early next year.
A quick look by The Associated Press at haircut prices and store aisles in Paris found some disparities. Haircut: women 43 euros, men 26. Roll-on deodorant: women 2.04 euros, men 1.96. Shaving gel: 2.87 euros in a pink canister, 2.39 in a blue one.
“Honestly, like many women I had noticed it and then I moved on to other things,” Pascale Boistard, France’s minister for women’s rights, told The Associated Press in an interview. “It is a fact that this happens in everyday life and with products that are commonly used. These disparities mean that by the end of the year, the sum is not negligible.”
New York City and California have outlawed the practice of charging differently for products or services according to gender, and in California companies face fines up to $4,000 if they’re caught breaking the law. In New York city, periodic sweeps have found nail salons go in a different direction, charging men more for manicures, pedicures and waxing. The EU requires member countries to have legislation ensuring men and women are treated equally but does not specify how.
In France, activist group Georgette Sand — named tongue-in-cheek after French author George Sand, who used a male pseudonym to be taken more seriously as a writer — is encouraging contributions to a photo blog of products priced differently according to gender. It now includes entries for painkillers, face lotion, even pepper-spray canisters. Even the youngest customers are affected — continued…

Hollywood hunk Chris Hemsworth has been named the Sexiest Man Alive by a magazine. The 31-year-old Australian actor succeeded rocker Adam Levine, who picked up the People Magazine title in 2013.
The ‘Thor’ star, who is a father of three, joked that he is going to use the honour to get out of diaper duty for the next couple of weeks.
“I think you’ve bought me a couple of weeks of bragging rights around the house. I can just say to her (wife Elsa Pataky), ‘Now remember, this is what the people think, so I don’t need to do the dishes anymore, I don’t need to change nappies. I’m above that. I’ve made it now’,” Hemsworth said.
Hemsworth said that he would rather be home in Australia, where he and Pataky recently bought a home in Byron Bay, than anywhere else in the world.
The couple has three kids – daughter India, two, and eight-month-old twin sons, Sasha and Tristan.

Bigg Boss 8: Housemates prepare to overthrow the dictatorGautamBigg Boss assigns the contestants a Secret Rebellion Task.
By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:25 pm | Updated: November 20, 2014 1:58 pm
Day 59 in the ‘Bigg Boss’ house revolves around Gautam’s subjects coming to terms with the injustice that is handed out to them.
After ruling Gautam City for a day, the new dictator is completely taken over by the strict no-nonsense stance. He is definitely out to make life difficult for his praja, be it wakeing up in the wee hours of the morning to look around every corner of the Bigg Boss house in search of any kind of indiscipline, waking up the housemates at 4 in the morning to punish them or ask someone to make Elaichi Milk for him in the middle of the night.
When the housemates finally wake up in the morning, they are in no mood to tolerate their dictator. In order to provide some relief, Bigg Boss assigns the contestants a Secret Rebellion Task to give them an opportunity to overthrow the rule of their dictator.
The housemates are required to lead a rebellion and complete four tasks which will bring them success. These four mini tasks are planting a microphone in Gautam’s royal chambers, lighting two flare bombs in the chamber, defacing all of Gautam’s posters which have been put up around the house, and breaking Gautam’s statue which has been put up in the garden area. The biggest challenge though, is to carry out this task without Gautam’s knowledge!
Praneet informs the contestants about this secret task, and they all come together, leaving behind their differences to create a movement, which takes Gautam and his royal guards by storm. Soon, tears are shed and tempers flare as they charge on determinedly, to overthrow their dictator.
Will the contestants be able to complete the task and overthrow Gautam?

IBM introduces Verse enterprise emailplatformIBM Verse brings in analytics and social collaboration to enterprise email.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: November 20, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 20, 2014 12:44 am
IBM has launched a new enterprise mailing service in India called Verse. The new e-mail application aims to deliver relevant content to users and integrates services like e-mail, meetings, calendars, file sharing, instant messaging, social updates, video chats into a single platform. Verse is currently in its beta stage and a freemium version will be released next year on IBM’s Cloud Marketplace.
“With IBM Mail Next, we’ve applied analytics to enterprise email and bring in social collaboration experience with focus on engaging people and driving outcomes, not managing messages and inboxes,” said Anmol Nautiyal, IBM Social Business and IBM Smarter Workforce Director.
IBM Verse is mostly targeted at enterprises which needs to collaborate more among teams especially in  SMEs and knowledge centric organisations. Verse is delivered on the SoftLayer cloud promising enterprise-grade security and will be also offered as an app for both iOS and Android to ensure similar user experience.
“Going forward, Verse will be hosted on data centres in India,” said Anmol Nautiyal, IBM Social Business and IBM Smarter Workforce Director. “The development team is working on bringing offline capabilties to it and is looking forward to integrate Verse on Apple’s iOS 8 soon.”
IBM Verse uses analytics to provide an ‘at-a-glance’ view, which brings in the user’s most critical actions for the day. The paltformn considers unique employee preferences and priorities over time and provides instant context about a given project as well as the people and teams collaborating on it. IBM claims that its analytics doesn’t mine a user’s inbox to increase advertising and monetize that data in other ways.
Clients using IBM Verse will also have the future option to embed a Watson feature which enables users to query Watson on a given topic and receive a direct reply with answers ranked by degree of confidence.
In July 2014, IBM launched a partnership with Apple to develop a new class of industry specific business apps to transform enterprise mobility. In September, IBM unveiled Watson Analytics to put powerful yet easy-to-use predictive and visual analytics tools in the palm of your hand, and in October launched Navigator to boost personal and team productivity by allowing users to easily and securely access, edit and share business documents.
Most recently, the company formed a global partnership with Twitter to transform how businesses understand customers, markets and trends by using Twitter data to make more informed decisions.

Help Bihar  or will not let enter here: Manjhis stern warning to Central ministers fromstateManjhi said the state government had laid a target to construct two crore toilets by 2019.
Patna | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:17 pm | Updated: November 20, 2014 2:19 am
In a fresh controversial remark, Bihar CM Jeetan Ram Manjhi on Wednesday said he would deny entry to seven Union ministers from the state, if they failed to bring desired assistance for the region.
“Satbhaiya ko Bihar nahi ghusne denge (Won’t allow the seven brothers to enter Bihar)”, Manjhi said as he accused the Centre of ignoring the state’s interests. The CM was speaking at a function on the occasion of ‘World Toilet Day’.  Though Manjhi did not take names, the seven ministers he referred to were Radha Mohan Singh, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan (cabinet ministers), Rajiv Pratap Rudy (MoS-Independent charge), Upendra Kushwaha, Ram Kripal Yadav and Giriraj Singh (all MoS).
The BJP sharply reacted to the CM’s statement, calling it “irresponsible”.
Meanwhile, in another bid to position himself as the Dalit face of JD(U), Manjhi said he became a CM in the course of his long struggle and he would not be surprised if he became Prime Minister someday through his struggle.
“Thokar khate khate CM ban gaye, kahi thokar mein PM na ban jaye. Hum Mahadalit thokar hi khate hain  (I have become CM after facing hardship, and might one day become Prime Minister also through the same struggle. We, Mahadalits, always have to face hardship).”
Manjhi recalled that while upper caste students were offered brooms to clean schools, lower caste ones were told to clean drains with bare hands.
Manjhi, who earlier termed upper caste “foreigners and descendants of Aryans”, is known for making controversial statements.
He recently said Scheduled Castes and OBCs constitute 65 per cent of the state’s population, and hence only they were “entitled to rule”.
The CM’s statements have embarrassed the JD(U) and its allies RJD and the Congress. Manjhi also met party leader Nitish Kumar twice in a month to “clarify his stand”.

Five Thai university students were detained Wednesday after giving a three-fingered salute inspired by “The Hunger Games” to the army-backed prime minister in a daring protest against the country’s military government.
The students, wearing T-shirts saying, “Don’t Want a Coup,” stood up with their backs to Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha while he spoke on a stage in Khon Kaen, a city in the northeast, an area that is a stronghold of former Premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup.
They raised three fingers above their heads, a symbol of resistance inspired by the book trilogy and Hollywood blockbuster, before police escorted them out. The five men from Khon Kaen University were taken to a police station and then an army camp, where they questioned by soldiers, human rights lawyer Sasinan Thamnithinan said. She said they have not been charged.
Thai protesters used the salute immediately after the May 22 coup, but have mostly stopped amid police crackdowns on demonstrations.
In “The Hunger Games,” the salute symbolizes rebellion against totalitarian rule, signifying thanks, admiration and good-bye to a loved one. But Thai protesters have also cited the French Revolution’s values of liberty, equality, fraternity, while others said it means freedom, election and democracy.
Prayuth, often prickly with critics, stopped his speech when the students stood, and smiled calmly. “Anyone else wants to protest? Come quickly. Then I can continue with my speech,” he said into the microphone as the audience chuckled.
Since taking power from a civilian, elected government in May, the military has heavily suppressed resistance from opposition groups and activists. Martial law, invoked a few days before the coup, remains in effect and bans political gatherings of five or more people.
“Mockingjay,” the third movie in the “The Hunger Games” series, opens in Thai cinemas Thursday.

The importance of the immigration debate -- in 1 mapBy Aaron Blake November 19 Follow @aaronblakewp

Even as President Obama prepares to announce his immigration executive action, the percentage of illegal immigrants in the United States has dropped. While the undocumented comprised an estimated 4 percent of the population in 2009, that number was down to 3.5 percent in 2012, according to data from Pew . The raw number was down from an estimated 12.2 million in 2009 to 11.2 million in 2012.
The reasons are mostly twofold: (1) the economic depression, which made immigrating illegally less attractive, and (2) the unprecedented deportations that have taken place during the Obama Administration -- more than 2 million , as of earlier this year.
But lest anyone think Obama's executive action won't potentially affect lots and lots of people, I bring you this:
The below map, from Pew, shows the percentage of K-12 students in each state who have at least one undocumented parent.

At the high end is Nevada. While 7.6 percent of Nevada residents are illegal immigrants, more than one in six K-12 students (17.7 percent) has at least one undocumented immigrant for a parent.
That number is 13.2 percent in California, 13.1 percent in Texas and 11 percent in Arizona. In each case, the number of children with undocumented parents is more than twice the overall undocumented population.
Another 20 states have more than 5 percent of students with an undocumented parent. Overall, 6.9 percent of American students -- about one in 14 -- have at least one illegal immigrant for a parent. That's compared to the 3.5 percent of Americans who are illegal immigrants.
It's a reminder that illegal immigrants are not the only ones who have a significant stake in what happens with Obama's executive order; so do the many more millions of people in their families.

FII investments via P-Notes surges to $43 bn in OctFII investments via P-Notes surges to USD 43 billion in October

Investments into domestic shares through participatory notes (P-Notes) surged to the highest level in more than six-and-half years at Rs 2.65 lakh crore (about $ 43 billion) in October.
According to the data released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the total value of P-Note investments in Indian markets (equity, debt and derivatives) rose to Rs 2,65,675 crore at the end of October from Rs 2,22,394 crore in September.
This is the highest level since February 2008, when the cumulative value of such investments stood at Rs 3,22,743 crore.
P-Notes, mostly used by overseas HNIs (High Networth Individuals), hedge funds and other foreign institutions, allow them to invest in Indian markets through registered Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), while saving on time and costs associated with direct registration.
According to market analysts, investment into the equity market via P-Notes had been rising in the past few months, mainly on account of the government's reforms agenda and a rally in the country's equity markets.
It shot up in May, post the General Election results, primarily on the new government's promise to revive economic growth and the momentum continued till October.
P-Note investments in Indian markets have climbed to Rs 1.86 lakh crore in October from Rs 1.68 lakh crore in the preceding month.
The quantum of FII investments through P-Notes grew to 12.2 per cent last month from 10.7 per cent in September.
Till a few years ago, P-Notes used to account for more than 50 per cent of the total FII investments, but their share has fallen after Sebi tightened the disclosure norms and other regulations for such investments.
P-Notes have been accounting for mostly 15-20 per cent of the total FII holdings in India since 2009, while it used to be much higher - in the range of 25-40 per cent - in 2008.
It was as high as over 50 per cent at the peak of Indian stock market bull run during a few months in 2007.

After a five-year courtship, actor Vir Das tied the knot with girlfriend Shivani Mathur at a secret ceremony in Sri Lanka.
The duo exchanged vows on Oct 19.  “We wanted to have a small ceremony for our wedding. There were only about 100 people, comprising family and close friends,” Vir said in a statement.
“I preferred my wedding to be a quiet affair. The rule at the wedding event was that everyone switched off their smart phones to spend quality time with each other,” he added.
The wedding consisted of a pool party, a rock concert, the sangeet ceremony and then the pheras.
“Owing to Vir and Shivani’s busy schedule, the couple haven’t had the time to go for a honeymoon, but would be soon taking time out,” said a source.
The actor will be seen in films like “Santa Banta” and “Mastizaade” that will release in the first half of 2015.

A Pakistani court sentenced four men to death Wednesday over the mob killing of a woman who married against her family’s wishes, a court official said.
Farzana Perveen, who was pregnant at the time, was beaten to death by her father and other relatives outside a courthouse in the eastern city of Lahore on May 27. The father surrendered to police after the killing and was among those sentenced to death.
She was going to the Lahore High Court in connection with a kidnapping case filed by her family against the woman and her husband. One of the attackers claimed to be Perveen’s husband, saying the woman married another man without divorcing him.
Court official Imtiaz Ahmed said the woman’s father, two brothers and the man who claimed to be the woman’s husband were sentenced to death. He said a fifth man was sentenced to 10 years in jail.
Arranged marriages are the norm among conservative Pakistanis, and hundreds of women are murdered every year in so-called honor killings carried out by husbands or relatives as a punishment for alleged adultery or other illicit sexual behavior.
Pakistan has one of the highest rates of violence against women globally. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a private group, says some 869 women were murdered in honor killings in 2013.

Sri Lanka on Wednesday released five Indian fishermen , who had been sentenced to death on drug trafficking charges, after a presidential pardon from Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Following the pardon, the five fishermen — all from Rameswaram coast in Tamil Nadu — were shifted from the Colombo prison where they were lodged to the Indian High Commission in the city. Confirming the release, a senior official at the High Commission said they are likely to be taken to Chennai on Thursday. “The five are at the Indian embassy in Colombo. Likely to land in Chennai by Thursday,” the official said.
The fishermen — P Emerson, 40, P Agustus, 32, R Wilson, 42, K Prasad, 30, and J Langlet, 22 — were arrested on November 28, 2011 on charges of smuggling heroin from India.
Prasad’s wife Skenitta told The Indian Express that she spoke to her husband over phone. “I could not wait anymore. I should thank the Indian and Sri Lankan authorities for his release. We are leaving for Chennai tonight to receive him,” she said.
An official statement from the Indian High Commission thanked President Rajapaksa for the release of the fishermen by cancelling the death sentence order issued by a high court using constitutional powers. The statement said Sri Lanka’s humanitarian gesture will further strengthen the strong and multi-faceted relations between India and Sri Lanka.

The statement recalled a telephone conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rajapaksa in this regard on November 9, eventually leading to the release of the five fishermen.
High Commissioner Y K Sinha met the five fishermen after their release and was making arrangements for their early return to India, said the official release.

She is someone who enjoys the star status in Bollywood but the critically-acclaimed actress Priyanka Chopra wishes to become a zombie for their inability to feel.
The actress took to social networking site Twitter to express her peculiar wish.
“I too want to be a zombie… Easy life must be when u don’t feel… Or at least it seems so while u r in zombie land!” she tweeted Nov 18.
Priyanka, who has shown her acting calibre in films including “Barfi!” and “Mary Kom”, has now started shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s “Bajirao Mastani”, which also stars Ranveer Singh.
“Make up-check, hair-check, wardrobe-check, lines-check! Brains… foggy! In so many ways! Gliding to set! #BajiraoMastani,” she further posted.
Meanwhile, the actress has also attended the big fat wedding of the Bollywood’s “Dabangg” star Salman Khan’s sister Arpita. The 32-year-old actress wished the couple a blissful future.
“Mere yaar ki shaadi thi… @khanarpita I wish you love that is like a beautiful song… from the beginning to the end… A lifetime of joy…” she tweeted Nov 18.
Arpita tied the knot with businessman Aayush Sharma on a star-studded evening in Hyderabad Tuesday.

Wikipedia could predict disease outbreaks

The team was able to forecast all but one of these outbreaks (tuberculosis in China) at least 28 days in advance.
TOPICS
world wide web
Wikipedia page views can predict disease outbreaks, including dengue fever and influenza, around the globe nearly a month before official health advice, according to new research.
Analysing such online trends could help scientists stay one step ahead of outbreaks around the globe, researchers said.
Researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory successfully monitored influenza outbreaks in the US, Poland, Japan and Thailand, dengue fever in Brazil and Thailand, and tuberculosis in China and Thailand.
The team was also able to forecast all but one of these outbreaks (tuberculosis in China) at least 28 days in advance.
The results suggest that people start searching for disease-related information on Wikipedia before they seek medical attention.
The research shows the potential to transfer models across different regions; that is, one can “train” a computer model using public health data in one location and implement the model in another region.
For example, researchers could create models using data from Japan to track and forecast disease in Thailand. This is particularly important for countries that do not offer reliable disease data, researchers said.
“A global disease-forecasting system will change the way we respond to epidemics. In the same way we check the weather each morning, individuals and public health officials can monitor disease incidence and plan for the future based on today’s forecast,” said Dr Sara Del Valle, who carried the study.
The study was published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology.

TOPICS
Test cricket
New Zealand bowled with discipline and, despite Azhar Ali and Younis Khan's half-centuries, looked set for a lead in the second Test against Pakistan in Dubai on Wednesday.
Pakistan lost Asad Shafiq in seamer Tim Southee’s penultimate over for 44 to close the third day on 281-6, still trailing by 122 runs on New Zealand’s first innings total of 403.
Sarfraz Ahmed was unbeaten on 28 and Yasir Shah.
Leg-spinner Ish Sodhi led the New Zealand bowling with two for 65.
Century stand
Pakistan, resuming at 34-2, saw off the first session without losing any wicket as Younis Khan (72) and Azhar Ali (75) shared a 113-run stand for the third wicket.
But New Zealand got four wickets in the next two sessions to press home its claims for a useful lead and in turn improve its chances for a series-levelling win.
Pakistan won the first Test by 248 runs in Abu Dhabi.
Ali added another 50 runs with skipper Misbah-ul Haq, but New Zealand hit back with the second new ball taken after 83 overs with the score at 194-3.
Trent Boult claimed his first wicket in the series when he produced a beautiful delivery which got the edge of Misbah’s bat and landed in the safe hands of Ross Taylor at first slip.
Misbah’s 28 had two boundaries and a six.
Ali drove spinner Mark Craig through point for three to complete his 18th half-century. But he too fell soon, trying to cut Sodhi and was bowled. He hit six boundaries and a six during his patient five-hour 22-minute vigil.
Shafiq was lucky to survive at 26 when Boult bowled him with a sharp incoming delivery but much to New Zealand's dismay it turned out to be a no-ball.
He too failed to bat for long and was caught off a loose shot in the end, adding 59 for the sixth wicket with Sarfraz.

New Zealand — 1st innings: 403.
Pakistan — 1st innings: S. Masood b Sodhi 13 Taufeeq st Watling b Craig 16, Azhar Ali b Sodhi 75, Younis Khan c Craig b Neesham 72, Misbah-ul Haq c Taylor b Boult 28, A.

Rupee hits 7.5 month low on dollar buying from oil firmsforeign exchange market
The Indian rupee extended its losses for the fifth session in a row and ended at 8-month low of 61.96 against the Greenback on Wednesday following sustained dollar demand from oil importers and weakness in local stock market.
Slowdown in inflows also weighed on rupee that ended 22 paise lower while the dollar index was trading almost stable against its six major global rivals ahead of the release of the minutes of a key US Federal Reserve meeting.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the local currency commenced lower at 61.80 a dollar from previous close of 61.74 and immediately touched a high of 61.7850.
However, dollar demand pulled down the rupee as it fell back sharply to a low of 61.9950. It settled at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96, logging a drop of 22 paise or 0.36 per cent.
This was its weakest closing since finishing at 62.04 on March 3, 2014. It had also logged intra-day low of 62.15 on March 4, 2014.
“Crude oil prices had fallen in the initial half of the day and prompted oil companies to speed up their greenback purchases also hurt sentiments. Furthermore, a fall in local stocks triggered concerns of foreign fund outflows that also weighed on rupee,” said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India.
The rupee has weakened by 45 paise in five straight days.
In the stock market, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex today tumbled by 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, after touching intra-day all-time peak of 28,294.01.
FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth USD 2.44 million on Tuesday, as per Sebi data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group, said: “Trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40.”
The dollar hit a new seven-year high against the yen and held near a over one-year peak versus sterling.
Forex experts said investors added favourable bets ahead of US Federal Reserve minutes that could highlight policy difference with its peers as hopes are high that Fed minutes will sound relatively more hawkish.
In the forward market, premia closed mixed.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in April softened to 208-210 paise from last close of 208.5-210.5 paise while forward contracts maturing in October, 2015 rose to 429-431 paise from 426.5-428.5 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.8280 and for the Euro at 77.4210.
The rupee dropped further against the pound to 97.18 from 96.71 previousl and remained weak against the euro to end at 77.70 from 77.28.
It, however, strengthened to 52.68 per 100 Japanese yen from Tuesday’s close of 52.93.

The shoot, which was titled Break The Internet, drew a barrage of criticism, but Kardashian is adamant the project was not based around gratuitous nudity.
During her appearance on Australian TV show ‘The Project’, she said, “I was so honoured and excited to work with (Goude) because he is a legend, and for me that was something I wanted to do to make myself feel confident.
“As a role model I’m not saying anyone else should do that, but for me it was an art project and it taught me to do what you want to do… I’m never one to preach, but I felt really positive and really good about myself. I love the photos, I did it for me, I hope other people like them.”

Salman Khans Kick doing good business inPolandSalman Khan's 'Kick' doing good business in Poland.
By: Indo-Asian News Service | Warsaw | Posted: November 19, 2014 5:04 pm
Superstar Salman Khan starrer ‘Kick’, that was released in many cities in Poland last week, is doing good business.
The film was released with Polish sub-titles and this helped Polish people, particularly the young, to enjoy the Bollywood masala fare thoroughly. The film is being shown in Warsaw, Krakow, Lublin, Poznan and in many important Polish cities.
“The response is very encouraging and the exhibitor is very happy,” said J. J. Singh, president of the Indo-Polish Chambers of Commerce and Industry (IPCCI) who was actively involved in the shooting of ‘Kick’.
The climax of this film was completed in the Polish capital in April this year when Salman could not get a British visa to shoot in London. The British authorities had refused a visa as Salman was facing charges in a Mumbai court.
This forced producer and director Sajid Nadiadwala to select Warsaw locations for dare-devil action scenes. A Polish company Film Polska had joined hands with Nadiadwala to finish the shooting speedily. It was only a two-week schedule.
Obviously Poles are very excited to see the action scenes.
“It is great to see our favourite Indian actor do amazing stunts scenes, whether he was jumping from Warsaw’s highest building, the Palace of Culture or a bus was thrown from a bridge over the Vistula river,” said Daria Dulok, a young Polish woman who is doing her doctorate on Bollywood culture.
It was the first time that an Indian film unit had selected Warsaw. Earlier in the winter of 2006, Aamir Khan, Kajol and Suniel Shetty had come to film the climax of ‘Fanna’ on Tatra mountains.
According to J.J. Singh, Ajay Devgn has selected Krakow for his next film and he is going to spend ten to fifteen weeks to shoot in April to June next year. Devgn had come to Poland in September to finalise the formalities and has signed a contract with Film Polska of Krakow to provide his unit all the logistics.
“It is really very encouraging that Poland finally has become a destination for Bollywood actors and producers. This year in July and August, Riteish Deshmukh had brought his unit to shoot ‘Bangistaan’ in Krakow, which is the most beautiful area in Poland.
“We have well qualified technicians and other support staff which is very professional. One Polish cinematographer Artur Zurawski did a commendable job when he shot Rani Mukherji’s ‘Mardani’,” said Janusz Krzyzowski, president of the Warsaw branch of the India-Polish Cultural Committee.

India calls for transparent selection process of UNchiefUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. (Source: Reuters photo)
By: Press Trust of India | United Nations | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:52 pm
With the term of current UN chief Ban Ki-moon set to end in 2016, India has called for a “more inclusive and transparent” procedure for appointment of the United Nations Secretary-General, with the General Assembly having a greater say in the selection process. Highlighting the critical need for revitalisation of the work of the General Assembly, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Asoke Mukerji said here that the 193- member UN body is the voice of the international community and must be given a greater say in the selection of the UN Secretary-General.
“The continued circumscribing of the Assembly’s role and responsibilities in the process of selection and appointment of the Secretary General needs to change. This is in the interests of the UN system in general, and the Assembly’s prerogatives in particular,” Mukerji said. “Efforts to put in place a more inclusive and transparent procedure for the appointment of the Secretary-General… needs to be undertaken without further delay,” he said.
Ban took office in January 2007 and was unanimously re-elected for a second term by the General Assembly in June 2011. He would continue to serve as the UN Chief till December 2016. Momentum is building up to make the selection process of the UN Chief more transparent amid growing frustration over the dominance of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council in appointing the Secretary General.
A coalition of NGOs ‘1 for 7 Billion’ is leading the call for opening up the manner in which the UN Chief is selected, saying, “seven billion people across the world are affected” by the UN Chief’s decisions but the Secretary General is “chosen in secret, by just five countries, in an opaque and outdated process”.
The coalition voiced concern that there is “no job description” for a UN Secretary General, no public scrutiny of candidates, the Security Council’s “shortlist” contains just one name and backroom deals can get a person elected. It also lamented that no woman has ever held the post.

Finch drives Australia to victory over South Africa
Reuters
One-day cricket
Australia's Aaron Finch hit his fifth one-day international century to drive the hosts to a 73-run victory over South Africa in Canberra on Wednesday and a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.
Finch put on 118 for the first wicket with David Warner (53) and went on to score 109 on a good Manuka Oval wicket before being bowled by Proteas skipper AB de Villiers.
Shane Watson hit a bright 40 but it fell to Steve Smith to haul Australia out of a mid-innings slump with a sparkling unbeaten 73 from 55 balls that gave Australia an imposing total of 329 for five.
South Africa are rarely daunted by any target and openers Hashim Amla (102) and Quinton de Kock (47) started at a brisk pace at the ground where they will play Ireland in a group match at the World Cup next year.
Their opening stand ended with 108 on the board when De Kock got a top edge to a Josh Hazlewood delivery that was caught by Mitch Marsh but Amla dug in as a couple of wickets fell at the other end to reach his 17th one-day century.
By now he had been joined by De Villiers and their partnership looked like it might give the tourists a series lead going into the final two matches, in Melbourne on Friday and Sydney on Sunday.
The match turned, however, when they were dismissed in successive overs, Amla clean-bowled by Hazlewood (3-51) and De Villiers trapped leg before by Kane Richardson for 52.
Australian left-arm paceman Mitch Starc took four for 32 in mopping up the South African tail, which was shortened with the tourists on 256-9 when spinner Imran Tahir failed to bat after picking up a knock in the field.

Iran nuclear talks get down to nitty-grittyJohn Kerry though, who held the latest in a string of meetings with Zarif in Oman last week, put the onus on Iran.
By: Agence-France Presse | Vienna | Posted: November 19, 2014 12:14 pm
Iran and six world powers get down to business in Vienna today, groping for the elusive magic formula to secure a milestone nuclear deal that satisfies hardliners in Tehran and Washington.
The clock will be ticking though on the second day of a final round of talks, with the deadline for Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany on Monday.
“This is a very critical week obviously in Iran negotiations,” US Secretary of State John Kerry, expected in the Austrian capital later in the week, said in London yesterday.
“We hope we get there but we can’t make any predictions.”
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, arriving in Vienna yesterday, said that a deal was “possible” and that if the talks fail it will be because the six powers wanted too much.
“If, because of excessive demands… we don’t get a result, then the world will understand that the Islamic Republic sought a solution, a compromise and a constructive agreement and that it will not renounce its rights and the greatness of the nation,” Zarif told Iranian media.
Kerry though, who held the latest in a string of meetings with Zarif in Oman last week, put the onus on Iran.
“It is imperative that Iran works with us with all possible effort to prove to the world that the programme is peaceful,” Kerry said.
British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond echoed his comments, calling for more “flexibility by the Iranians to convince us that their intentions in their nuclear programme are entirely peaceful”.
The landmark accord being sought by Monday’s deadline, after months of negotiations, is aimed at easing fears that Tehran might develop nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian activities.
It could resolve a 12-year standoff, silence talk of war, help normalise Iran’s relations with the West, boost the beleaguered Iranian economy and mark a rare foreign success for US President Barack Obama.
In order to make it virtually impossible for Iran to assemble a nuclear weapon, the US, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany (the P5+1) want Iran to scale down its nuclear programme.
Iran, which insists its nuclear aims are exclusively peaceful despite failing to declare parts of its programme in the past, wants painful sanctions lifted.
Some areas appear provisionally settled. But the big problem remains enrichment, rendering uranium suitable for power generation and other peaceful uses — but also, at high purities, for a weapon.

commons vote which affects tied pubsCan politicians save Britain's pubs?
The government has been defeated in a Commons vote on the control that parent companies can exercise over pubs.
MPs voted 284 to 259 in favour of an amendment allowing landlords an independent rent review and to buy their beer on the open market.
So-called "tied pubs" are required to buy supplies - often at high prices - from the companies that own the pubs.
Campaigners said the "historic" vote would help "secure the future of the Great British pub".
The amendment to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill was put forward by Lib Dem Greg Mulholland.
Mr Mulholland, the chairman of the all-party Parliamentary Save the Pub group, described the "tie" arrangement made between a pub and its owner as an "archaic" and "extraordinary" system.
Market rent
It is thought to be the government's first defeat on one of its own bills since the 2010 election.
Ministers want to create a pubs code, aimed at helping pub landlords struggling to pay rent or beer costs.
It includes the right to request a rent review after five years.
But campaigners wanted the automatic right for pub landlords to exchange their tenancy for an independently-assessed market rent without any "tie".
In an attempt to head off a defeat on the amendment, which was signed by MPs of all parties, Business Minister Jo Swinson said the government would introduce new measures to allow pub landlords to apply for "market rent" rates from after two years, if a review found other measures in the bill had not helped them sufficiently.
'Gradual process'
But Mr Mulholland said this would be "business as usual".
He told MPs the new clause, which was backed by Labour, had been drafted by lawyers and publicans and would come in gradually, reducing the impact on the industry.
He added: "This is a reasonable gradual process that will simply bring back market forces into a sector that frankly has become grotesquely anti-competitive."
Tim Page, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said he was "delighted" that "after 10 years of our campaigning, MPs have today voted to introduce a market rent only option for licensees tied to the large pub companies - a move that will secure the future of the Great British pub".
The Federation of Small Businesses said it was "a historic day for tied publicans who look forward to a more open and competitive marketplace".
But the British Beer and Pub Association said the outcome was "hugely damaging".
Chief executive Brigid Simmonds said: "This change effectively breaks the 'beer tie', which has served Britain's unique pub industry well for nearly 400 years."

ED questions Radha Timblo in money laundering caseED questions Goa miner Radha Timblo in money laundering case
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 19, 2014  | 14:09 IST
Radha Timblo
Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday questioned Goa-based miner Radha Timblo , whose name figured in the black money list submitted by the government in the Supreme Court, in connection with a money laundering probe against her mining firm.
"She was grilled by the investigating officer of the case in Goa today. Her statement has been recorded," sources in the agency said.
They said the agency has given Timblo a week's time to furnish certain additional details about her and her mining company- Timblo Private Limited.
ED has asked Timblo to furnish details of her company, its business operations and their financial transactions over the last few years.
"She has promised full cooperation in the probe case," they said.
The firm and its directors are being probed by ED, along with other mining firms based in Goa, after it registered a criminal case in the Rs 35,000-crore Goa illegal mining scam which was earlier investigated by the Justice M B Shah Commission for alleged large-scale irregularities.
Sources added that after interrogating Timblo, summons will soon be sent to her son Chetan Timblo and four other executives for recording their statements in the same case.
Timblo's name came to the fore after the central government submitted a list in the Supreme Court last month mentioning the name of the firm and its directors including Radha Satish Timblo, Chetan S Timblo, Rohan S Timblo, Anna C Timblo and Mallika R Timblo.
Timblo had maintained she had "no undisclosed bank account abroad" and that she has not done anything illegal.
The agency had, in June this year, registered a complaint under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after taking cognisance of the reports of the Commission, the inquiry boards constituted in this regard and also an FIR filed by Goa police's Crime Branch last year in August.

"fined" 100 by a Blackpool hotelTrip Advisor couple 'fined' £100 by hotel for bad review
Tony and Jan Jenkinson were charged £100 for describing the hotel as a "rotten stinking hovel"
Microsoft goes to EU over Google
A couple say they have been "fined" £100 by a Blackpool hotel for leaving critical comments on travel review website Trip Advisor.
Tony and Jan Jenkinson posted the negative comment after being unimpressed with the one night they spent at the Broadway Hotel.
The couple, from Whitehaven, later found £100 charged to their credit card. The hotel said its policy was to charge for "bad" reviews.
Trading Standards are investigating.
Officials believe the hotel may have breached unfair trading practice regulations.
The manager of the hotel, on Burlington Road West, was unavailable when contacted by the BBC.
'Freedom of speech?'
The hotel policy, contained in a booking document, reads: "Despite the fact that repeat customers and couples love our hotel, your friends and family may not.
"For every bad review left on any website, the group organiser will be charged a maximum £100 per review."
Mr and Mrs Jenkinson were on their way to visit family in Oxford when they decided to split up their journey.
The negative review was left on the Trip Advisor website
They said they only chose the hotel because it had a car park and paid £36 for the double room.
Retired van driver Mr Jenkinson, 63, said the details of the charge were in the booking documents, but his wife did not have her glasses on and signed it without reading the small print.
Mr Jenkinson said he intended to fight the charge, adding: "Annoyed isn't strong enough for how I feel about this, what happened to freedom of speech?
"Everybody we have spoken to says they (the hotel) are not allowed to do this."
John Greenbank, north trading standards area manager, said it was a "novel" way to prevent bad reviews.
'Get service right'
He said: "I have worked for trading standards for many years and have never seen anything like this.
"The hotel management clearly thinks they have come up with a novel way to prevent bad reviews, however we believe this could be deemed an unfair trading practice."
The couple have sought a refund via their credit card company.
Councillor John McCreesh, cabinet member for trading standards, said: "Customers need to be free to be honest about the service they're getting.
"Other customers depend upon it. Hotel owners should focus on getting their service right rather than shutting down aggrieved customers with threats and fines.
"People should have the right to vent their disappointment if a hotel stay did not meet their expectations and should not be prevented from having their say."

By: Press Trust of India | Suva | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:03 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 3:07 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday left for home after concluding his 10-day three nation tour during which he attended the East Asia and ASEAN-India Summits in Myanmar, the G-20 Summit in Australia and held bilaterals with his Australian and Fijian counterparts. Modi, the first Indian premier to visit the Pacific country after Indira Gandhi who had come to Fiji in 1981, left its capital Suva on a special Indian Air Force plane.
He held talks with his Fijian counterpart Frank Bainimarama and also announced a slew of Lines of Credit and development aid totalling USD 80 million for the country. Modi also announced USD one million Special Adaptation Fund for the Pacific nations and a proposal to develop Pan Pacific Islands Project for tele-medicine and tele-education. He also addressed Fijian parliament, the first by a foreign leader, after parliamentary elections, during which he said that India was prepared to build a “Digital Fiji”.
Noting the inconvenience in travel due to Visa issues, Modi announced visa on arrival facility for all the 14 Pacific Island countries and hoped that it will facilitate exchanges and promote better understanding between the peoples.
During his four-city tour in Australia, Modi and his counterpart Tony Abbott agreed on a landmark framework for security cooperation across the spectrum in defence, cyber and maritime security and combating terrorism, including the threats posed by foreign fighters joining extremists groups.
Modi, the first prime minister to visit Australia in 28 years, also addressed the Australian Parliament. The two countries also decided to conclude a long-pending Free Trade pact by the end of next year and an “early closure” of the civilian nuclear deal that will facilitate uranium imports to India. Prior to arriving in Australia, Modi attended the ASEAN-India summit and the East Asia Summit in Myanmar.
At the East Asia summit in Myanmar capital Nay Pyi Taw, Modi asserted that the world community must reject any linkage between religion and terrorism while formulating a “genuinely international” partnership in the fight against all forms of terror acts. On India-ASEAN relationship, Modi said there were “no irritants” in their ties and they can be “great” partners.
He said there will be “major improvement” in India’s trade policy and environment and proposed a special facility for speedy implementation of connectivity projects with the 10-nation ASEAN bloc. On the sidelines of the summits, Modi met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak, Russian Premier Dmitry Medvedev, and Thai counterpart Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha.

2A new machine has been recently revealed the "first of its kind" machine that could turn water and carbon dioxide into the synthetic petroleum-based fuels.
German cleantech company Sunfire GmbH has unveiled a rig, which uses what it calls "Power-to-Liquid" technology to convert water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) into liquid hydrocarbons; synthetic petrol, diesel and kerosene, CNet reported.
The technique has been based around the Fischer-Tropsch process developed in 1925, combined with solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOECs).
The SOECs are used to convert electricity supplied by renewable sources such as wind and solar to steam. Oxygen is removed from this steam to produce hydrogen.
The rig, at this stage, is for demonstration and feasibility purposes; its capacity for CO2 recycling is currently at around 3.2 tonnes per day, and it has the capacity to produce a barrel of fuel per day.

The Indian rupee extended its losses for the fifth session in a row and ended at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96 against the Greenback on Wednesday following sustained dollar demand from oil importers and weakness in local stock market.
Slowdown in inflows also weighed on rupee that ended 22 paise lower while the dollar index was trading almost stable against its six major global rivals ahead of the release of the minutes of a key US Federal Reserve meeting.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the local currency commenced lower at 61.80 a dollar from previous close of 61.74 and immediately touched a high of 61.7850.
However, dollar demand pulled down the rupee as it fell back sharply to a low of 61.9950. It settled at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96, logging a drop of 22 paise or 0.36 per cent. This was its weakest closing since finishing at 62.04 on March 3, 2014. It had also logged intra-day low of 62.15 on March 4, 2014. Crude oil prices had fallen in the initial half of the day and prompted oil companies to speed up their greenback purchases also hurt sentiments.
Furthermore, a fall in local stocks triggered concerns of foreign fund outflows that also weighed on rupee, said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India. The rupee has weakened by 45 paise in five straight days.
In the stock market, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex tumbled by 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, after touching intra-day all-time peak of 28,294.01. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $2.44 million on Tuesday, as per Sebi data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group, said: Trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40.

BCCI throws weight behind Srinivasan  Raman; postpones AGM to December 17The Board backed Srinivasan, who has also been cleared of allegations that he tried to subvert the probe. BCCI said the charges against Srinivasan were aimed at destabilising the Board. (Source: PTI)

The Indian cricket board’s emergent working committee meeting in Chennai on Tuesday turned out to be uneventful. The opposition didn’t raise its voice, shifting the onus to the apex court instead. From a further postponement of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to December 17 to defending IPL chief operating officer (COO) Sundar Raman, they followed the BCCI line, much to the relief of the board hierarchy.
“All matters are sub judice, so we should wait for the Supreme Court’s order,” Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) president Prakash Dixit, known to be a close Shashank Manohar aide, told The Indian Express. Dixit elaborated. “As for the AGM, the BCCI counsel appealed to the court for a postponement and the Supreme Court indirectly acceded to that. So we didn’t raise an objection and it had been agreed unanimously that the meeting would be held on December 17. For the sake of Indian cricket and BCCI, we decided not to disturb the process.”
In a press note, sent a few days ago, former BCCI president Manohar, however, had said the cricket board didn’t have the authority to postpone the AGM for a second time.
“Once the date of the AGM was fixed by the working committee, the same could not and cannot be altered by any office bearer of the board as they do not have authority to do so,” read the statement.
When contacted today, Manohar said: “I said whatever I had to say about the AGM. I stick to that. As for the other issues, I didn’t attend the meeting so can’t comment.”
The BCCI in a statement said: “The members noted the conclusions in the final report of the Mudgal committee and felt that there is no taint on the conduct of Mr Srinivasan and the allegations levelled against him by unscrupulous elements were baseless and were aimed at destabilising the working of the BCCI.”
In Raman’s case, the IPL COO has been prima facie indicted in the Justice Mudgal committee report for his alleged link with an unnamed contact of a bookmaker. “Sundar Raman’s issue is not an issue. Like all other people he should be allowed to present himself in the Supreme Court. We will wait for the court’s decision,” BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel said after the meeting.
“We believe Sundar Raman is not guilty, which is the reason why we have decided to support him,” a top BCCI official said. Dixit, too, felt discretion would be the better part of valour.
“Sundar Raman clarified his position before the working committee. He said, he receives so many calls everyday that it’s not possible to keep a record. He also said he reported the matter to one or two ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit officials, which is mentioned in the report.”
But did he find Raman’s continued…

Say (sour) cheese: Of intolerable Mirka & cry baby WawrinkaRoger Federer tweeted this picture with the caption: "It's great being with the boys again." (Source: @rogerfederer)

Just two days after pulling out of the last match of the World Tour Finals in London, Roger Federer did not train in Lille on Tuesday ahead of the Davis Cup final — claiming in a news conference that his ‘back wasn’t good enough for practice yet’. While this raised severe doubt over the 17-time Grand Slam winner’s participation in the France-Switzerland tie beginning Friday, it wasn’t close to being the big talking point of the day.
His supposed rift with Swiss team-mate and opponent in the semi-finals in London, Stanislas Wawrinka, was. And to make things even more interesting, for both the fans and the media, that rift is said to have been caused by Wawrinka’s on-court duel of words with Federer’s wife, Mirka.
According to the Daily Mail, Federer and Wawrinka are said to have ‘had a furious 10-minute row in a private room backstage at the O2 Arena after their semifinal match’, one that was a tense affair on the court as well with Federer narrowly clinching the nailbiter 7-6 in the third and final set. But according to two videos uploaded by the British tabloid, the ‘furious 10-minute row’ had little to do with the match and almost everything to do with a heated exchange between Mrs Federer and Wawrinka in the third set.
In the first video, taped at 5-all and deuce in the third set, Wawrinka is seen pulling away from his receiving stance even as Federer gets into his service motion. Wawrinka, the reigning Australian Open champion, is then seen pointing his racquet in the direction of what is believed to be Federer’s box before saying: “Not just before the serve.”
The audio then catches a woman’s voice (allegedly Mirka) heckling Wawrinka, calling him a ‘cry baby’ in response. To which Wawrinka looks at both Federer and chair-umpire Cedric Mourier and asks: “You hear what she say?” As Wawrinka begins walking in the direction of the box, the camera pans towards Mourier, who pleads “No Stan, no” to the agitated Swiss. It seems to do the trick as Wawrinka returns to the court and takes stance, but not without staring one last time to his right.
In a supplementary second video uploaded on the Daily Mail website, Wawrinka is seen complaining in French to the umpire during an earlier change-over. The translated subtitles say: “She did the same at Wimbledon. Each time I’m on her side she yells before every time I serve. It’s intolerable.”
While Federer was in damage-control mode on Tuesday, posting a picture of him and the team, including Wawrinka, on Twitter, the media didn’t bite, asking him details about the rift during the press conference. “There’re no hard feelings whatsoever,” said Federer. “We are friends, not enemies, but it (the backstage continued…

I was not in best shape  says Magnus CarlsenPrint
A few moves into the game, Carlsen fell asleep, eyes closed, slouched in his chair, and the pen caught in mid-air. (Source: FIDE)

The expression said it all. Tired and somewhat lost, that’s how world champion Magnus Carlsen looked, both during and after Game 8. After all, it’s not everyday that one plays a marathon six-and-a-half-hours of nerve-wracking and brain fuzzing chess against one of the best theoreticians in the game, a certain Viswanathan Anand.
So despite being almost half his age, Carlsen, with all his energy and ability in driving opponents up against the wall by squeezing them dry before he plucks them like deadwood, was clearly out of sorts when the game started. A few moves into the game, Carlsen fell asleep, eyes closed, slouched in his chair, and the pen caught in mid-air.
Whether it was to unsettle the five-time former world champion is anybody’s guess, but Carlsen admitted at the post-match press conference that he was not feeling in good shape. “I was not in the best of shape at the start,” Carlsen replied to a question before adding “I felt I managed to be fresher as the game progressed.”
His opponent would agree. If he had hoped to catch Carlsen off guard, that was not to be as the Norwegian looked better prepared, despite the fatigue. With the game heading for a bishop and knight ending, Anand’s hopes of securing a vital point and levelling the series looked bleak as Carlsen played a good line.
At the end Anand admitted he didn’t get much from the Queen’s gambit opening.
“But there’s still some games left to play,” the Indian said, the disappointment pretty evident despite his best efforts to maintain a certain amount of nonchalance. What must be gnawing Anand is the fact that despite not feeling in great shape, Carlsen had managed to pull off a quick draw with relative ease. Carlsen said he was happy with the opening, but admitted it was a bit risky for black. “But once I got Vishy’s rook there was just very little for white to do,” was his assessment.
There were some talks at the post-match conference of Anand’s long-time former second Peter Heine Nielsen playing a crucial role in getting Carlsen to prepare better to counter the Indian’s opening. The Norwegian didn’t comment much but admitted that his seconds are doing a good job. With four games remaining and the scores 4.5-3.5, the players have a rest day on Wednesday. Carlsen acknowledged the importance of rest days. “As the match progresses the free days become more and more valuable,” the 23-year-old said.
For Anand, he needs to find that last ounce of inspiration and innovation if he is to reclaim his crown.

It’s time for Amitabh Bachchan to say goodbye to Kolkata, where he was shooting for his upcoming film “ Piku “. The megastar is now headed to Goa to attend the 45th edition of International Film Festival of India (IFFI).

Amitabh Bachchan also says that he has a packed schedule and travel plans. The “Baghban” actor, who remains active on all social media platforms, also ponders over refraining from posting on the websites due to the crammed-up schedule.
“In serious packing formalities and travel .. will restrict my comments and responses .. love to all !!,” he further posted.

A Pakistani court sentenced four men to death Wednesday over the mob killing of a woman who married against her family’s wishes, a court official said.
Farzana Perveen, who was pregnant at the time, was beaten to death by her father and other relatives outside a courthouse in the eastern city of Lahore on May 27. The father surrendered to police after the killing and was among those sentenced to death.
She was going to the Lahore High Court in connection with a kidnapping case filed by her family against the woman and her husband. One of the attackers claimed to be Perveen’s husband, saying the woman married another man without divorcing him.
Court official Imtiaz Ahmed said the woman’s father, two brothers and the man who claimed to be the woman’s husband were sentenced to death. He said a fifth man was sentenced to 10 years in jail.
Arranged marriages are the norm among conservative Pakistanis, and hundreds of women are murdered every year in so-called honor killings carried out by husbands or relatives as a punishment for alleged adultery or other illicit sexual behavior.
Pakistan has one of the highest rates of violence against women globally. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a private group, says some 869 women were murdered in honor killings in 2013.

People of Kashmir will decide on Article 370  we want only discussion: RajnathSinghUnion Home Minister Rajnath Singh at a press conference in New Delhi (Photo: PTI)
Written by Arun Sharma | Bhaderwah | Posted: November 19, 2014 5:34 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 7:47 pm
Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said that Bharatiya Janata Party only want discussion on Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and its final decision rests with the people.
Criticising political opponents of trying to create misconception about BJP by raking up Article 370, he said that “It is being said that BJP will repeal Article 370…they have been asking BJP to clear its stand on it,’’ Singh said a public rally here. “We want discussion on it…what objection you have?’’ Singh asked, adding “whether people in a democracy do not even have the right to talk about it. The people will decide whether Article 370 has benefitted them or not’’.
Rajnath Singh was accompanied by L-G Najeeb Jung and Delhi Police Commissioner B S Bassi.(Source: PTI)
In this context, he referred to the state government’s refusal to implement provisions of 73rd amendment of the Indian Constitution empowering elected panchayats in the state like elsewhere the country. “However, I assure you that if BJP government comes in the state, we will implement 73rd amendment…The Panchayati Raj institutions in the state will be strengthened,’’ he added.
“We do not want to get public support by creating fear, but by winning their hearts through love and affection and by creating trust among them,’’ Singh said. In this context, he referred to Peoples Conference leader Sajjad Lone, adding that “some separatists who used to defame BJP have been compelled by people’s faith in our government to change their thinking’’.
Pointing out that sometimes, these people also raise Kashmir issue so as to create misconception among people about the BJP, Singh asked “whether we do not have love and affection for the Valley. Criticising political opponents of creating divide between Jammu and Kashmir regions, he reminded people that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and many union ministers reached there during floods. “Had government gone there, if we had to do politics?’’ he asked. He said that politics shall not be played on the basis of caste or religion, but on the basis of justice and humanity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed magnanimity in offering help even to the people of Pakistan occupied Kashmir during floods.

In what would come as a shot in the arm for N. Srinivasan, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya has extended East Zone’s support to the embattled BCCI president, who is seeking a third term as the Board chief, by signing the nomination papers for the December 17 elections.
“All six units of East Zone have signed the nomination papers extending support to Mr. Srinivasan in different combinations,” said a top official, who attended the Board’s working committee meeting in Chennai on Tuesday.
Another BCCI official said that there was little chance of Sharad Pawar becoming the President.
“This, I think, is the end of the road for Mr. (Sharad) Pawar (in his attempt to return as President). I don’t see anyone else becoming BCCI President at the AGM,” the official, who did not wish to be identified, said.
Pawar had decided to attend the BCCI AGM after four years when it was originally announced to be held on November 20 before it was put off to December, retaining Chennai as the venue.
A former president of the BCCI, Dalmiya had himself faced allegations of financial impropriety in the PILCOM accounts of the 1996 World Cup jointly hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, before the matter was resolved.
Dalmiya was earlier reported to be hesitant in offering support to ICC Chairman Srinivasan. But now he seems to have agreed to support the Tamil Nadu strongman in his bid to become BCCI President for the next term.
With Srinivasan now having got the required unanimous support in writing from the East Zone, whose turn it is to decide the man at the helm, it appears to be a dead-end as far as any other presidential candidate is concerned.
The heat, it appears, is off Srinivasan, at least for now.

New MINI Cooper launched at Rs. 31.85lakhBoth the three door and five door MINI Coopers have been launched with a 1.5 litre twin turbo four cylinder diesel engine.
By: Express News Service | Posted: November 19, 2014 5:58 pm | Updated: November 21, 2014 10:09 am
BMW owned MINI has launched it’s new three-door and five-door Cooper models in India. The 2014 third generation MINI is underpinned by it’s parent company’s new UKL1 platform that has been first used on the MINI Cooper itself. The platform is a modular architecture designed to suit a range of front and four-wheel drive models. This platform is also going to underpin the new MINI Clubman aswell.
The new MINI Cooper carries along the car’s traditional design language with a slightly more rounded design language in the interest of better aerodynamics and improved pedestrian impact protection. The new three-door MINI Cooper is also larger than the second generation model by being 98mm longer, 44mm wider, 7mm taller and with a 28mm longer wheelbase. The car offers a boot space of 280 litres and with the rear seats folded, there is 941 litres of space.
The new MINI Cooper carries along the car’s traditional design design language.
While the three-door model undoubtedly sticks to the compact Cooper’s sporty design language, the five-door model is better suited to our market as a more practical offering in this family oriented market. It’s clever compact outside, spacious inside design of course playing it’s part as well.
Both the three door and five door MINI Coopers have been launched with a 1.5 litre twin turbo four cylinder diesel engine developing 116PS of max power and 270Nm of peak torque. The three door model is priced at Rs. 31.85 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) while the five-door model is priced at Rs. 35.20 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
It is claimed that the legendary go kart like handling of the MINI has been further enhanced in this new model. The new platform has also given the car a new front suspension and revised rear suspension.

Maruti offering heavy discounts on Ritz  Stingray andDZireMaruti is currently offering a flat cash discount of as much as Rs 36,000 on the Wagon R Stingray VXi variant.
By: Express News Service | Posted: November 19, 2014 5:50 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 6:04 pm
As the year-end approaches, car manufacturers across the country are out with some of the most lucrative and mouth-watering discount offers so as to clear their current year stock. This time of the year is also one of those rarest of occasions when India’s largest car manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki, comes out and lures its customers with attractive deals on its products. As you will read on in the following part of the story, heavy discounts are being offered on selected models of Maruti Wagon R Stingray,  Ritz and Swift DZire in the month of November.
Wagon R Stingray:
Maruti is currently offering a flat cash discount of as much as Rs 36,000 on the Wagon R Stingray VXi variant. An exchange bonus of Rs 25,000 is also offered on the car. Currently, the Wagon R VXi (metallic) carries a price-tag of Rs 4.31 in ex- showroom, New Delhi. Post discounts, the ex-showroom prices will stand at Rs 3.95 lakh (without exchange) and Rs 3.70 lakh with exchange.
Considering the fact that the Stingray VXi comes with equipments like projector headlamps and alloy wheels as standard, the ongoing discounts make it an even more value for money proposition.
Ritz:
Low demands as compared to its sibling Swift is one of the reasons why the Ritz could never send the cash registers ringing for Maruti the same way as it’s sportier sibling. On the up side, the Ritz is priced slightly lower than the Swift and does almost everything the Swift does. For the month of November, Maruti is offering even more discounts on the car.
On the top-end Ritz ZXi petrol variant, there’s a cash discount of Rs 30,000 on offer.
Those trading in their old vehicle for the car will also benefit from an additional exchange bonus of Rs 30,000 on top of the cash discount. The Ritz ZXi is priced at Rs 5.14 lakh in ex-showroom New Delhi. The revised pricing after discounts will be Rs 4.54 lakh (with exchange) and Rs 4.84 without exchange. Both the prices are indicative of ex-showroom, New Delhi.
Also, being the top-model in the range, the Ritz ZXi comes kitted with all the safety net like ABS and driver and front passenger airbags. With all the current discounts, the Ritz ZXi is a definitely a steal at this price point.
Swift DZire VDi
Customers can avail an exchange bonus of Rs 40,000 on the Swift DZire. Since it is one of the best-selling, and at times even top-selling, cars in India, the discounts offered are considerably lower than the above the Ritz and the Stingray. The DZire VDi is priced at Rs 6.51 lakh ex-showroom New Delhi.
After the exchange discounts, the ex-showroom price for the DZire VDi will start from Rs continued…

Kidambi Srikanth continued his giant-killing spree while Saina Nehwal hardly broke a sweat to advance to the pre-quarterfinals of the USD 350,000 Hong Kong Super Series in Kowloon in Hong Kong on Wednesday.
Srikanth, who had stunned five-time world champion Lin Dan in the China Open Super Series Premier final last week to become the first male shuttler to win a Super Series Premier event, shocked seventh seed Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei 18-21 22-20 21-16 in his men’s singles campaign opener.
In the women’s singles, Saina, who also bagged the China Open title, needed just 27 minute to beat unseeded Jamie Subandhi of United States 21-17 21-11 in her campaign opener.
P V Sindhu also started her campaign on a winning note to book a pre-quarterfinal berth.
Seventh seed Sindhu, who had skipped the China Open, notched up a thrilling 21-15 16-21 21-19 win over Thailand’s Busanan Ongbumrungpan in a women’s singles match that lasted 52 minutes.
Ajay Jayaram, who had won Dutch Open Grand Prix last month, proved no match for top seed Chen Long of China as he went down 13-21 7-21 in another men’s singles match.
Another Indian in the fray in men’s singles, R M V Gurusaidutt also lost in the first round, going down to Sho Sasaki of Japan 15-21 21-15 20-22 in a close match that lasted a little over one hour.
It was curtains for the men’s and women’s doubles pairs also as they suffered contrasting defeats to bow out of the competition.
While 2011 World Championship bronze medallists, Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa fought bravely before going down 21-16 14-21 21-23 to Malaysian pair of Yin Loo Lim and Lee Meng Yean in women’s doubles, men’s combination of Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy went down 15-21 17-21 to second seeds Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan of Indonesia.

Sebi to reduce listing time duration for companiesSebi working on plans to reduce listing time period for firms

Capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi)is working on plans to reduce the time duration for a company to start trading on stock exchanges after initial public offer (IPO) to six days.
At present, the time taken for a company to get listed after initial share sale is around 12 days.
A proposal on it is expected to be discussed during Sebi's board meeting in Mumbai on November 19, official sources said.
Sebi may reduce the post issue timelines from T+12 days (12 days from issue closure to listing and trading) to T+6 days, they added.
Once the process gets stabilised, timelines could be further curtailed to T+2/3 days, the sources said.
Sebi had formed a group comprising of representatives from the stock exchanges, depositories and others to work on norms that would enable use of existing secondary market infrastructure for collection of IPO bids and application money; reduce the post issue timelines and help companies reach more retail investors.
Among others, there is a proposal to enable investors to submit its applications to any registered stock broker or depository participant.
Investors may also have the option to submit Applications Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) to its bank.
According to the proposal, making ASBA mechanism mandatory for retail investors has the potential to reduce the post issue timelines.
Under ASBA mechanism, investors can bid for shares while the money remains in his/her bank account and gets debited only after allotment of the shares.
Currently, 54 banks in India are providing ASBA facility to the investors.
Moreover, it has been proposed that the current arbitration process, settlement guarantee fund and investor protection fund available for secondary market trading be extended for primary market transactions subject to certain conditions and modifications. 

Govt to take imminent steps to curb gold importsGovt to take imminent steps to curb gold imports, says finance ministry source

Government is likely to announce measures to curb gold imports as early as Tuesday, a senior finance ministry source said, as a surge in inbound shipments threatens to worsen the country's trade deficit.
"We are working on it. The measures to slow gold imports are almost ready and may be announced today or tomorrow," said the source, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Gold imports into India, the world's no. 2 gold consumer behind China, surged nearly fourfold in October to $4.18 billion from a year ago, data showed on Monday.
Although country's trade deficit has so far been kept in check by lower oil imports, analysts warn that is unlikely to last if inbound gold shipments continue to surge.
Struggling with high current account and trade deficits, India last year raised the import duty on gold to a record 10 per cent and imposed other import restrictions, some of which it relaxed in May.
Imports of the precious metal have risen steadily since August, boosted by jewellery demand for the wedding season, raising concerns among policymakers.
Last Thursday, officials from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the finance ministry met to review the country's gold import policy, but no decision was taken.

Ranbaxy sues FDA for revoking drug approvalsRanbaxy sues FDA over revoking approvals for Nexium, Valcyte

Ranbaxy Laboratories has sued the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for revoking approvals granted to the firm to launch copies of two drugs including AstraZeneca Plc's heartburn pill Nexium, court documents showed.
The FDA told Ranbaxy this month that it believed its decisions to grant the company tentative approvals for copies of Nexium and Roche AG's antiviral Valcyte were "in error", after it found that Ranbaxy's plants at the time were not compliant with the FDA's manufacturing quality standards.
The agency also stripped Ranbaxy of a six-month market exclusivity on the launch of generic Valcyte.
In the suit filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia, Ranbaxy said the FDA's move violated constitutional rights, exceeded the agency's statutory authority, and was "arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise contrary to law."
"FDA has no power to correct an alleged mistake it made six years ago," Ranbaxy said in the court filing dated November 14 and seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
Ranbaxy, which is being acquired by larger local rival Sun Pharmaceutical Industries for $3.2 billion, has been hit by a series of regulatory sanctions in the past year due to poor production practices at its India-based plants.
The company, which was expected to hugely benefit from the launch of the generic versions of the two drugs, has said it was working on resolving issues at the India plants, all of which are banned from exporting to the United States, its largest market.
Ranbaxy did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokeswoman for FDA did not reply to an email seeking comment outside of US business hours.
Analysts had expected generic Nexium to contribute about $150 million to Ranbaxy's revenue in the first six months of market exclusivity, while Valcyte was expected to bring in $40 million to $50 million.
After pulling Ranbaxy's tentative approvals, the FDA granted final approval to another Indian generic drugmaker Dr Reddy's Laboratories and US-based Endo International Plc to launch copies of Valcyte.
Ranbaxy in the lawsuit also requested the court to restrain FDA from approving any other generic versions of Valcyte or Nexium until its six-month exclusive periods on the launch of the drugs has ended.

Nokia returns  with the N1... an iPad lookalikeThe Nokia N1 will be available in China first
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Posted: November 18, 2014 3:59 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 1:25 pm
So, the Nokia brand isn’t dead yet. Just a week after Microsoft de-hyphenated the Nokia name from its smart devices, the original Nokia in Finland has showcased the N1 tablet under its own brand.
The 7.9-inch Nokia N1 looks a lot like the new Apple iPad Air, even though it runs Android Lolipop but with Nokia Z launcher. The gesture-based Nokia Z launcher has been available as a free download on Google Play store for a few months now.
Considering that it is Nokia’s return in more ways than one, the choice of a tablet, that too one that looks too much like the iPad seems a bit of a surprise now. In fact, the only thing that is visbly different from the Apple device is the Android OS inside.
Nokia sees to have stuck to its old naming pattern by calling the tablet the N1. The device, to be manufactured by Foxconn, will be launched in China first at a price of $249 and will launch in Europe starting with Russia.
The one-piece design with surface anodised aluminum will remind buyers of the iPad. The tablet will be powered by a 2.3GHz Intel 64-bit Atom Z3580 Processor and will have 2GB LPDDR3 (800 MHz).
The 7.9-inch screen will have a 4:3 aspect ratio and 2048×1536 resolution IPS panel and protected by Gorilla glass 3. The tablet will have an internal storage of 32GB and Micro-USB port for charging.
There will be an 8 MP rear-facing camera with autofocus, 5 MP front-facing camera with fixed focus and 1080p video recording. The 318g weight and 6.9mm thickness should make the tablet very sleek.

Rupee falls to over 8.5-mth low on dollar demandFOREX UPDATE: Rupee falls to over 8.5-mth low on dollar demand

The Indian rupee extended its losses for the fifth session in a row and ended at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96 against the Greenback on Wednesday following sustained dollar demand from oil importers and weakness in local stock market.
Slowdown in inflows also weighed on rupee that ended 22 paise lower while the dollar index was trading almost stable against its six major global rivals ahead of the release of the minutes of a key US Federal Reserve meeting.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the local currency commenced lower at 61.80 a dollar from previous close of 61.74 and immediately touched a high of 61.7850.
However, dollar demand pulled down the rupee as it fell back sharply to a low of 61.9950. It settled at 8-1/2-month low of 61.96, logging a drop of 22 paise or 0.36 per cent. This was its weakest closing since finishing at 62.04 on March 3, 2014. It had also logged intra-day low of 62.15 on March 4, 2014. Crude oil prices had fallen in the initial half of the day and prompted oil companies to speed up their greenback purchases also hurt sentiments.
Furthermore, a fall in local stocks triggered concerns of foreign fund outflows that also weighed on rupee, said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India. The rupee has weakened by 45 paise in five straight days.
In the stock market, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex tumbled by 130.44 points, or 0.46 per cent, after touching intra-day all-time peak of 28,294.01. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $2.44 million on Tuesday, as per Sebi data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group, said: Trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40.

I want to settle down again  says ZeenatAmanPrint
"Of course I want to settle down with someone once again. Why wouldn't I? You see, all these years I've single-mindedly focussed on my sons Azaan and Zahaan. Their well-being and happiness are all that mattered to me while they were growing up.
By: Indo-Asian News Service | Mumbai | Posted: November 19, 2014 6:07 pm | Updated: November 20, 2014 10:25 am
Yesteryear’s glamorous actress Zeenat Aman, who turned 63 Nov 19, says she is ready to settle down again.
“Of course I want to settle down with someone once again. Why wouldn’t I? You see, all these years I’ve single-mindedly focussed on my sons Azaan and Zahaan. Their well-being and happiness are all that mattered to me while they were growing up.
“Now that they have matured and have a life of their own. I can begin to think about my own life once again,” says Zeenat with a laugh as she takes on her 60s headlong.
During her heydays Zeenat worked round the clock to become one of the most sough-after actresses in the 1970s. Her marriage to Mazhar Khan in 1985 considerably slackened her work-pace.
“You must understand I worked relentlessly for 15 years. When I got married I had reached a sort of saturation point. I wanted to focus on my marriage, husband and then the two boys. Now my sons are grown up and have a life of their own. They are both multi-talented.
“A older one has graduated. The younger one is qualified in the culinary arts, and in music and acting. Let’s see which way they go. At the moment their future is fluid,” she said.
Zeenat describes her own state of the heart as also fluid. She won’t admit having someone in her life but readily admits to being ready for love and marriage in spite of being singularly unlucky all her life in matters of the heart.
“I hold no grudges against anyone. I believe there are good people out there. And I believe there is always room for love and companionship,” says Zeenat.
She admits she isn;t that hopeful about her career.
“There are just that many roles for actresses my age. In fact the opportunities are almost non-existent.For better or worse I can’t chase work. I never have done that. I choose from whatever comes my way.”
Zeenat hasn’t had much luck with the quality of roles in recent times. But she isn’t complaining.
“I will do another film now only when it’s something worth my while. I don’t need to act just for the heck of it,” she said.

Facebook is launching a new application for the social networking site's already existing 'Groups' feature that provides a shortcut on smartphones for easy accessibility to Groups.
According to CNN, the app updates the look of Groups but its core features are largely the same. The new features include unread counts and the ability to share a group.
The company said that thousands of users check and create groups every month. However, posting a group takes some time right now especially on mobile devices.
Facebook has been busy launching new apps recently like Rooms, Poke and Messenger.
However, Groups will continue to look the same on the desktop versions and mobile applications and all photos, videos and updates through the Groups app will show up in Facebook news feed.

Mizoram Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla on Wednesday read out before the state assembly the names, designation and charges against 25 gazetted officers in Mizoram — including an Additional Inspector General of Police, a Director and Deputy Director of major departments and senior government engineers including a Chief Engineer — who are currently being investigated by the vigilance department on various corruption charges.
The Congress veteran, who since returning to power in 2008 after a decade has repeatedly said that his government is dedicated to fighting corruption, was replying to a question by Mizo National Front MLA Lalrinawma, who asked how many gazetted officers currently have vigilance cases pending against them.
Lal Thanhawla replied 25 gazetted officers face such cases, and proceeded to read out the list.
Among those on it are suspended PWD Chief Engineer (Highways) Vanlalduhsaka, who is charged with awarding 13.75 percent extra to contractors SLT Infracon and who was also investigated for lapses that allegedly led to a massive landslide in Aizawl that killed 17 people last year.
Three of Vanlalduhsaka’s PWD colleagues are also being investigated by the vigilance department — among them Assistant Engineer Lalramzauva for allegedly taking money from contractors in connection with the building of a polytechnic at eastern Champhai town, and Executive Engineer R Zatawna for allegedly mis-appropriating Rs 6.75 lakhs of government money.
Another senior officer under investigation is AIG-III Thomas Zodingliana, a Mizoram Police Service (MPS) service cadre, for “deployment of police personnel for his private works.”
Former Agriculture Director H Lalthanpuia is also under investigation for drawing “fraudulent bills amounting to Rs 14.34 lakhs”, while Deputy Director of Horticulture H Lalchhuanvawra and another officer of the same department, Lalrinawmi Renthlei, are being probed for mis-appropriating funds meant for grape cultivation at Hnahlan, the main hub of Mizoram’s indigenous wine industry.
Other officials under investigation include a headmaster of a government-owned Higher Secondary School, a Medical Officer, a handful of Block Development Officers, and a host of other officials with various other departments.
After Lal Thanhawla read out the names Lalrinawma, the opposition MLA who asked the question, commented, “Thank you. I got a reply much more detailed than I expected.”

Israel demolished the east Jerusalem home of a Palestinian who carried out a deadly October attack, just hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised strict security measures in the wake of a grisly synagogue assault a day earlier.
The synagogue attack, which left five people dead, was the deadliest in Jerusalem since 2008 and came amid weeks of violence linked to a disputed holy site sacred to Jews and Muslims. Nearly a dozen people have been killed in attacks by Palestinians using guns, knives and vehicles.
The house demolished in the Silwan neighborhood near the Old City belonged to Abdel Rahman al-Shaludi, who killed two people last month when he drove his car into a crowd standing on a light rail platform in Jerusalem.

Cop arrested for molesting school girl in ArunachaltownPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 20, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 20, 2014 12:24 am
A police officer of the rank of an Sub-Inspector was arrested following allegations of molesting a school girl in Roing, headquarter town of Lower Dibang Valley district in Arunachal Pradesh. He has been booked under Section 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.
Stating this Lower Dibang Valley district SP Rajneesh Gupta said while the police officer allegedly molested the Class X girl who was on her way to school Tuesday morning, he has been arrested and also placed under suspension.
“A magistrate has already recorded the victim’s statement, while necessary medical examinations have been also conducted immediately. We are submitting the chargesheet in connection with the case as early as possible in order to ensure speedy justice,” the SP told The Indian Express over the telephone from Roing on Wednesday.
Local sources said the girl was on her way to attend a private tuition when the police officer allegedly lured her into his official quarter on the pretext of asking for help in operating his new mobile phone. The girl, who regularly passes by the officer’s quarter did not doubt his intentions, but was molested once she entered his house, sources said. The girl, who managed to get out of the house, immediately informed the local unit of All Idu Mishmi Students’ Union (AIMSU), whose president Lokha Elapra in turn lodged an FIR in the Roing police station.
Ironically, the police officer arrested for the alleged sexual abuse of the girl was supposed to attend an Art of Living camp that began in Roing Tuesday. Organised by the district administration, the camp is being atttended by teachers, high school students, parents, other citizens as well as police officers. The camp is discussing issues related to drug abuse, alcoholism, sexual abuse of children, and other social malaises.
Meanwhile, Gumri Ringu, who has just relinquished her office as chairperson of the Arunachal Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (APSCPCR), while condemning the incident, has demanded exemplary punishment to the police officer involved in the incident. “There should be zero tolerance in this case where a police officer who is expected to protect children and other citizens had committed such a heinous crime,” Ringu, also president of Arunachal Pradesh Women Welfare Society, said.
Ringu said number of such incidents of sexual abuse of children has been increasing in the hill state. “Many such cases have gone unreported in recent times. Cases of sexual abuse and exploitation of children, especially girls, are rampant in schools run by both Christian and Hindu missionaries,” Ringu alleged.
It was only last month that the Lower Dibang Valley district administration had constituted a district-level committee headed by the SP to look into cases related to sexual abuse and exploitation of children, especially in schools. Principals and headmasters were also asked to verify character-related antecedents of all employees including teachers, and also conduct awareness programmes involving upper class students with the help of NGOs and counselors.

A suicide car bomber struck in the heart of the northern Iraqi Kurdish city of Irbil on Wednesday, killing at least four people, a spokesman said.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the midday attack near the ancient citadel in Irbil, capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq, though it bore the hallmarks of the Islamic State group.
Irbil has remained mostly calm, but it lies close to the front-lines in Iraq’s war against the Sunni militant group. The city has taken in thousands of refugees who fled the extremists’ summer blitz that captured large swaths of northern and western Iraq, as well as a third of neighboring Syria.

Three of the four people killed in Wednesday’s explosion were guards, said Hamza Hamid, a spokesman for the Irbil governor. The Iraqi Kurdish health ministry reported at least 22 were wounded.
Hamid said the attack took place “right in front of the main entrance of the building of Irbil governorate,” which is near the citadel.
Mayor Nawzad Hadi told the state-run Rudaw TV channel that the bomber tried to enter the citadel grounds but failed, so he detonated his explosives-laden car outside the complex.
The mayor said properties in the area suffered significant damage but it was unclear if the citadel, claimed to be one of the world’s longest continuously inhabited landmarks, was damaged. The hilltop castle has a history stretching back more than 8,000 years. In 2007, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, continued…

Indias retaliatory action made Pakistan to take UN refuge:RajnathBy: Press Trust of India | Bhaderwah | Posted: November 19, 2014 6:23 pm
Pakistan was forced to take United Nation’s refuge to stop retaliatory action by India in the wake of repeated ceasefire violations, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said Wednesday. “They (Pakistan) went to request the United Nations Security Council to ask India to stop (retaliatory action),” Singh told a public rally in Bhaderwah . “It was the policy of the Congress government to show only white flags even if Pakistan side killed every Indian. We asked the DG BSF to give a befitting reply to the Pakistani side,” he said.
“After ceasefire violations on the International Border by the Pakistani side, I asked the Director General of BSF as to how they have responded. He replied that we (Indian side) are showing white flag as we want to hold dialogue with Pakistan,” he said. Singh said he then ordered the DG BSF to give Pakistan a befitting reply to the ceasefire violations. He said it was because of the befitting reply from the Indian side that Pakistan was forced to appeal to the United Nation.
Singh said some people were trying to create communal tension. “But, we say that we have special affection for the people of Kashmir that is why post floods, I and Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself went to see the situation in the Valley,” he said. He said Modi was so moved by the plight of the people of Kashmir that he not only sanctioned Rs 1,000 crore for the flood-hit people, but also offered to extend help to residents of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).
“The Prime Minister asked the Pakistan government to allow us to help the flood affected people of PoK as well,” he said. He said that India strongly maintained that PoK belonged to India and would welcome if it once again decides to return to India. He said Pakistan has been trying hard to raise the Kashmir issue at the international level, “But, we say that they have completely destroyed the PoK area which is with them.” Singh said India always wanted good relations with its neighbours, including Pakistan and China.
Singh said some separatist forces were trying to spread “misinformation” about BJP, but the strong governance given by the party at the Centre prompted some separatists to join the mainstream. “It is because of the strong leadership given by BJP that some separatist leaders have changed their mind and Sajad Lone is an example who has joined the political mainstream due to this,” he said.
Referring to the denial of visa to Narendra Modi by the US government when he was Gujarat Chief Minister, Singh said during one of his visits to the US he had said that the people of India would create a situation wherein the US will have to give a red carpet welcome to Modi. “Modi has enhanced the image of this country throughout the world,” he said. continued…

Mitchell Starc  Josh Hazlewood bowl Australia to comprehensivewinHazlewood accounted for three important wickets that of De Kock, Hashim Amla and Farhaan Behardien. (Source: AP File)
By: Associated Press | Canberra | Posted: November 19, 2014 6:20 pm
Opener Aaron Finch scored 109 and Steve Smith added an unbeaten 73 off 55 balls as Australia beat South Africa by 73 runs on Wednesday to lead 2-1 in their five-match one-day international series.
After winning the toss, Finch and David Warner (53) raced to 118-0 before Vernon Philander took the first wicket in the 20th over. Finch notched his fifth one-day century when he hit consecutive boundaries off Imran Tahir to reach 99, then took a hurried single when the spinner misfielded.
In South Africa’s reply, opener Hashim Amla scored 102 before being bowled by Josh Hazlewood.
Finch batted powerfully for 40 overs before being clean bowled as he tried to hit AB de Villiers (1-42 off six overs) out of Manuka Oval. That left Smith, later named man of the match, to guide Australia, 242-3 at the time, through the last 10 overs.
South Africa made a strong start to its run chase when Amla and Quinton de Kock (47) put on 108 for the opening wicket.
But de Kock departed after skying a Hazlewood (3-51) delivery to Mitchell Marsh in the 19th over, and Faf du Plessis (17) and Rilee Rossouw (2) fell to Marsh and Mitchell Starc (4-32) in the 27th and 28th overs.
That brought de Villiers to the crease and the in-form captain hit 52 runs off 34 deliveries as he put on 76 runs with Amla for the fourth wicket.
But when he and Amla departed in the 38th and 39th overs, de Villiers lbw to Kane Richardson and Amla bowled by Hazlewood, the chase was in trouble at 226-5.
“It’s disappointing. We were in the game and I got out at a bad time,” de Villiers said.
The South Africans lost David Miller (3), Philander (1) and Dale Steyn (12) for 21 runs and trailed by 77 runs when Morne Morkel joined Farhaan Behardien in the middle.
Behardien was out for 12 in the 45th over, leaving South Africa 256-9. No. 11 Tahir could not bat after injuring his knee in the field and Australia was handed the win.
Smith’s total included a four hit from between his legs.
“I was able to close it out,” Smith said. ‘We played really well and never gave them much of a chance to get back in the game.”
Australia was playing without captain Michael Clarke, who has a hamstring injury which could keep him out of the upcoming test series against India, and Mitchell Johnson, who is being rested for the final three one-day matches to prepare him for India.
The last two one-day matches will be on Friday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and on Sunday in Sydney.

Casual dining hotels make better business senseStory
Casual is Fine
No-frills casual dining restaurants make better business sense while the best of class fine dining takes a back seat.

For anyone keen to venture into the restaurant business, it is the classy fine dining that strikes the imagination. Haughty and buttoned-up waiters, a formal style of service, hushed rooms, starched linen tablecloths, high-quality decor and dedicated meal courses - altogether a genteel and upmarket experience. This is what until 2012 Manu Chandra, who was then executive chef at Olive Beach, a fine dining Mediterranean cuisine restaurant in Bangalore, and his colleague Chetan Rampal, business development manager, too imagined for themselves when they decided to turn entrepreneurs.

But when they took a close look at the average pay-out per person in such a restaurant, they gave the idea a re-think. At fine dining restaurants like Olive Bar and Kitchen or Hakkasan in Mumbai, it is anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000. Are Indian consumers ready to pay for this experience? "A fine dining restaurant requires huge investment. It is difficult to get good returns in a challenging economy," says Chandra.
Of course, a flagging economy does not mean the upper middle-class has stopped dining out. "But they may shy away from paying Rs 2,000 per person. Also, those in the age group 20 to 35 are looking for interesting dining-out experience. So we needed to create an aspirational place," says Rampal. This led them to open a more casual Monkey Bar, the country's first gastropub, in Bangalore. A gastropub is a classical pub that also serves good food at affordable prices.
The venture was timely and the break even was attained in six months. "Most pubs were dark and dingy watering holes. There weren't too many food options," says Chandra. At an average Rs 800 per head, the Monkey Bar, which can accommodate close to 300 people, not just served cocktails and beverages but also offered myriad food options like char-grilled burgers, vada pav and the Goan Chorizo Pao. The duo has since then set up three more such bars, two in Delhi and one in Bangalore.
Owners of several iconic fine-dining restaurant chains like deGustibus Hospitality, which operates Indigo and Tote on the Turf, are fast learning that smart casual dining makes more business sense in these times. Of the Rs 9,500-crore restaurant business, casual dining forms the core with Rs 4,000-crore. This is expected to touch Rs 9,000 crore by 2018, according to industry estimates. The fine dining market remains at Rs 500 crore. So while deGustibus is expanding its casual dining restaurant chain Indigo Deli , Olive Bar and Kitchen is focussing on Olive Bistro and SodaBottleOpenerWala.
Unlike their fine dining counterparts, these places provide a more relaxed dining experience and offer an all-day menu with more casual options like burgers, sandwiches and sliders. The average cost per person in a Bistro or Deli is between Rs 800 and Rs 1,200. By keeping the cost low, these restaurants are attracting higher footfall. "The profitability in casual dining is higher because there is volume. Fine dining does not generate volumes. So our growth will be on the back of this format," says A.D. Singh, Managing Director of Olive Bar and Kitchen.
Singh has opened four Olive Bistro in the past few years. Through SodaBottleOpenerWala in Gurgaon, he has also stepped into another format that serves Mumbai street food. He says it is his tribute to Irani cafes of Mumbai. With Aditya Birla Private Equity picking up a minority stake in his business, he plans to open similar outlets in Delhi and Bangalore this year. Rahul Akerkar, Founder and Managing Director of deGustibus, too has opened six Indigo Delis in Mumbai and one in Delhi.
Setting up one such Deli costs him Rs 2 crore to Rs 3 crore. But he says it is far more profitable than setting up an Indigo fine-dining restaurant. Also, there are some must-haves in fine dining that the casual dining business can overlook, such as elegant space. For instance, Akerkar invested Rs 4 crore 15 years ago to set up Indigo in a quaint bungalow in an upmarket locality in South Mumbai. "If I were to invest today, it would cost me three times more and I am not sure about the returns," he says.
Can he repeat it in a mall today? No. "Fine dining requires elegant space. Also, you need to get more volume to pay the rent. In fine dining you cannot do volume," he said. Instead, a mid-level casual dining restaurant in places with high footfalls like malls can get more customers.
Both Singh and Akerkar agree that running a casual dining business is also economical. Unlike fine dining where imported and expensive ingredients are used, here they can source ingredients locally and still produce good food. "We still use quality ingredients and make very good breads. The chefs too are high quality and a lot of thought still goes into each dish. For the customer, its a friendlier restaurant and not intimidating in terms of ambience and price," says Singh.
When Singh set up Olive Bar in 2000, fine dining was limited to five-star hotels. Then the customers were looking for similar quality in a slightly more casual and relaxed environs. "This led to the birth of standalone fine dining restaurants such as ours. Now the customers want to be even more casual. They want to go in shorts and have a nice meal," he says.
Even a matured market like London, known to have some of the best fine dining restaurants, is going the casual dining way. But even today the upper class in London won't hesitate to spend Rs 300 to eat in a Michelin Star fine dining restaurant. And it is here, according to Akerkar, that India differs. "We have a huge middle class that has made money but are not exposed from the point of view of palette. They are eager to taste and buy but the decisive factor is price. The value for money when you eat at a high end dining is not appreciated yet in India," he says.
For any fine dining restaurant, 35 per cent to 40 per cent of revenue comes from sale of liquor. For casual dining, it is around 15 per cent. In India, there are long festive periods during which people often keep away from liquor and this makes standalone fine dining business unviable.

According to Uday Menon, Chief Business Officer of Barbeque Nation, fine dining does not work unless it is part of a big hotel. "If you are part of a hotel you get to import duty-free foreign liquor. A standalone restaurant has to buy liquor at regular retail price, which is prohibitively expensive," he says.
Celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor who operates 29 gourmet Indian restaurants under the Yellow Chilli brand, says only value dining format makes sense in India. Working in five-star hotels, he says, has made him aware of inefficiencies of fine dining. "It starts from the way you peel a potato or how sensitive you are to the area in the kitchen you are using, how sensitive you are to the electricity you use. It's a direct conversion to the share of wallet that a diner will pay," he says.
Kapoor says that most fine dining restaurants in hotels charge the same price for a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian meal especially when they do a party menu. "They throw in a beer or a glass of wine into the menu and do a common pricing even for those who don't consume alcohol. These are inefficiencies and I removed them. This helped me serve the same chicken, the same paneer but at 50 per cent cheaper," he says.
So for the time being, it is great food served in a pleasing ambience at an economical rate. So what if there is no fancy table cloth or expensive bone china crockery? "The level of informality and casualness helps separate the formats of today from that of yesterday," says Singh of Olive.

The role and future of technology in IndiaStory

A galaxy of CEOs discusses with Microsoft's Satya Nadella the role and future of technology in India.

Whether you have the title or simply take on the mindset of a CEO, there is no doubt that they come in different shapes and hues. Young or old, male or female, leaders or shrinking violets, one thing the wannabes and the successful ones know is the importance of being able to reinvent themselves and their business with changing times. A lithe Satya Nadella, the third CEO of Microsoft, definitely looked and talked like one of them among the 150 others who had flocked on September 29 evening at Hotel Trident at Nariman Point in Mumbai for an event organised by the India Today Group and Microsoft. It was Nadella's first visit to India after taking over the reins of the $77.85-billion technology giant in February this year.

Microsoft, the lord of the desktop era, too has transformed along with the rapid evolution in computing. Though still riding on software business, the company is refocussing by increasing its spending on cloud services. The gradual shift in its business model also has much to do with the vision and values Nadella as CEO propounds.
'We also have to keep pushing the boundaries on what is to be sold and bought online,' says Kunal Bahl, Co-founder & CEO, Snapdeal.com.
Expounding on his idea on the role that technology should play at a panel discussion on "The Leadership Challenge: Innovating to Deliver on Indias Promise", he said, "It's not celebrating the device and the certain applications in it, but the mobility of the human being involved."
Besides Nadella, the panel included Kunal Bahl, Co-founder and CEO of Snapdeal.com; Adi Godrej, Chairman of Godrej Group; Chanda Kochhar, MD and CEO of ICICI Bank; and Noshir Kaka, MD of McKinsey India. The talk was moderated by Shekhar Gupta, Editorial Advisor to the India Today Group.
'If we can arrive at solutions which are scalable and affordable, we can make a lot of difference,' says Chanda Kochhar,  MD & CEO, ICICI Bank.
At a time when even entreprise computing is going mobile, Nadella said despite the way technology is progressing, what is lacking is the thought about how it will evolve to help organisations become more productive. "That is the real question that we have to ask rather than celebrating the computing power that is around us," he said. Looking around, he said, "Look at this room. Theres an abundance of computing power because of what you have in your pockets with sensors and big and large screens. Whats scarce is human attention."
The 47-year-old CEO was very clear that India has a promising future especially with technology as an enabler. "I think it can be a great enabler to the human capital of a country," he said while stressing the fact that human needs should shape the technology and not the other way round. "It's [about] putting people at the centre and then the applications and the data and the devices come together to give you a richer experience. This is perhaps the more important mobility trend versus being fixated on one device as the be all and end all," said Nadella.
'Science and technology has led to a lot of innovation that allows us to provide low-cost products,' says Adi Godrej, Chairman, Godrej Group.
Kochhar said that technology as an enabler and differentiator in Indias progress is very feasible because "getting to scale [expanding and improving] is easy". She said India is a good ground for constant innovation as the customer base is technology receptive. "If we can arrive at solutions which are scalable and affordable, we can make a lot of difference," she said.
Talking about what lies ahead in terms of innovation, Nadella said, "I don't think we want to be in a state where we are plugging along eight devices to be in every different mode that we operate in. I think the ability to walk up to any device and have it recognise you, have your data, have your applications is in the near future."
Talking about the scope of technology, Godrej pointed to the role it can play in beefing up manufacturing in an economy where consumption is likely to go up if goods are available at a reasonable price. "Science and technology has led to a lot of innovation that allows us to provide low-cost products," he said.

Nadella was all praise about the rise of e-commerce companies in both China and India. "I think the US is going to learn from [it]. I think we are at a stage where business models will be innovated in India and will be replicable in other places as well," he said.
(From left) Sachin Bansal, Co-founder & CEO of Flipkart; Latif Nathani, Managing Director, eBay India, and Snapdeal's Kunal Bahl.
The youngest in the panel, Bahl of Snapdeal, said several product companies are fuelling the growth of e-commerce platforms. These firms are looking to address not just India but a global customer base. But for this to work well, Bahl said, there is need for increased use of the online-offline parity that technology, in this case the Internet, brings in. "We also have to keep pushing the boundaries on what is to be sold and bought online," he said.

The panel discussion was interspersed with witty and tongue-in-cheek remarks. For instance, when Gupta asked Nadella how he allowed Bahl to leave Microsoft, pat came a reply, "Lets say a more enlightened immigration policy would help." Bahl was then on the company's emerging business development team.

On a serious note, however, Kaka of McKinsey said that though there is constant innovation in several fields, the technology reach is increasingfairly slowly in sectors such as health care and education.  "What we should also talk about is the impact of technology on social India. If you look at the opportunity in health care and education, you can say thats a huge problem or say what a wonderful opportunity for technology to do something," he said.
'What we should also talk about is the impact of technology on social India,' says Noshir Kaka, MD, McKinsey India.
Nadella said the sectors that technology can disrupt will be manufacturing, health and pharma. "I won't call it disruption, but innovation," he added.

Don t make fortune out of poor: RBI Governor to micro lendersDon't make fortune out of poor, says Raghuram Rajan to micro lenders

RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan (Photo: Reuters)
Asking micro-lenders to look at only a "reasonable profit" to sustain their business while serving borrowers at the bottom of pyramid, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said that one should not think of making a fortune while serving poorest of the poor.
The comments come in sharp contrast to management guru late CK Prahalad's views in his book 'The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid'.
The concept of the fortune at the bottom of the pyramid originally appeared in an article by Prahalad and Stuart L Hart in business journal 'Strategy+Business' in 2004.
That was followed by a book with the same title that discussed new business models targeted at providing goods and services to the poorest.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates , a philanthropist who has seen so far spent millions annually to help the poor, has described the book as something that offers an intriguing blueprint for how to fight poverty with profitability.
Rajan, himself is a renowned economist, said during a recent micro finance event, "I think Prahalad did a disservice by saying that there is a fortune at the bottom of the pyramid.
"My sense is that you cannot, in good conscience, make a fortune at the bottom of the pyramid. Make reasonable profits, but if you start making a fortune, it does start raising societal anxiety about how the fortune is being made".
Following the advice of Prahalad, many companies across the world and especially consumer goods, auto and telecom marketers in the country, have begun to tap the underserved markets and made a big market out of them, Rajan said.
He added however that reasonable profit must be there at the bottom of the pyramid as the business has to be self-sustaining.
"If business is not self-sustaining, then entities will make a pretence of doing the business, but they are not really going to get engaged until there are profits," Rajan noted.
The poor who want to borrow often face local monopolies, which in the long-run can be taken care of by market competition, but in short-run borrowers have to deal with it, Rajan said.
"When they face local monopolies, then essentially we don't have the presence of a competition commission right at the grassroots. And therefore, sometimes laws like you cannot charge more than a certain amount may be necessary to protect the poor," he said.
Rajan said an interest rate cap on loans given by MFIs may force some people to go to money lenders who are outside the formal system and can charge an arm and a leg, but at the same time it ensures protection of consumers.
He said: "So, we should have a reasonable ceiling, not too low but not so high that it is irrelevant. When we have more competition we can remove this ceiling."
"For now, despite the MFIs saying that the ceiling is harmful, and I admit it does harm certain individuals who are forced into the hands of the money lender, it is something that we should continuously re-examine but we probably have to live with it at this point."
The Reserve Bank had in April 2012 capped the interest rate on MFI loans at 26 per cent following the Malegam committee report.
RBI set up the Malegam committee after the October 2010 MFI crisis in Andhra, when the state banned MFIs from coercively collecting instalments after some borrowers allegedly committed suicides fearing recovery agents.
This led to a massive default by borrowers in the undivided state from which the then largest MFI market is yet to recover.

Such an approach is a possibility because  of the work done at a Stanford lab, which used techniques of origami  and roll-to-roll manufacturing to create a microscope which can go up  till 2100x resolution and costs less than a dollar in parts to assemble. Called Foldscope, it can be cut out of paper and fitted together  with small lenses, batteries and an LED to a make bookmark-sized  microscope. Field trials have been on for several months to tweak its  efficiency and as an outreach project.
Backstory
Manu  Prakash, an IIT Kanpur and MIT alumnus, runs a Biophysics lab at  Stanford that is particularly interested in a branch of organisms called  'basal metazoans', which include creatures like sponges. As Prakash  says in an online video, he wanted to democratise access to this world  of microorganisms the way astronomy is now open to DIY hobbyists. The  idea was that science can be about asking questions and simply looking  with the help of available equipment, which did not have to be  expensive.
Strains connecting the work were principles of origami -  which had found applications in everything, from space telescopes to  making robots - and were useful in manufacturing because of their  ability to make 3D structures out of 2D sheets. James Cybulski,  Prakash's graduate student, tinkered and made these strains come  together in an efficient manner. Roll-to-roll manufacturing processes,  used in making matchboxes, could make for assembly units of even a  billion possible.
How It Works
The microscope is  assembled in three layers, and these can be modified to provide several  different types of imaging. In one assembly, there is the ability to  project the image on a wall.
The first is a sample holding layer,  where a normal slide can fit in. The second is the optics layer and  finally, the illumination or light source layer.
Small modules -  like paper jigsaw puzzle pieces with the cheaper optics printed in the  middle - can be inserted into the folds of the origami assembly. The  process uses origami to ensure that the optics align. All the parts can  be cut out of a single sheet of paper.
When assembled together, it  works as a functional microscope. Once the sample slide is put in, a  layer at the top moves left or right to change the field of view while  tension in the fingers can make it move up or down to focus.
Breaking Out
A  high point was showcasing the assembly at a Maker Faire hosted by the  White House in June. The director of the US National Institutes of  Health, Francis Collins, who was at the Faire, featured an entire post  on his blog on it. Prakash has also been on the lecture circuit,  including TED and others.
In terms of funding,  last year the Foldscope received about $750,000 in grants over three  years from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.
India Connect
In  an online video, Prakash says he was inspired by a photograph of  Mahatma Gandhi peering through a microscope when he visited Sevagram  years ago, to look at the intersection of science and society.
What Else Is      Out There
A  diagnostic toolkit that can latch out from a mobile phone has been  created by researchers in Berkeley, a company called CellScope has been  spun out. There are other ways to rig mobile phones and get their images  to higher magnifications. The Foldscope can also be coupled to an  iPhone, according to the PloS paper.
Future Plans
The  Prakash Lab is doing work with microfluidics as well, a research area  touched upon last issue. This work, done with his graduate student  George Kotir, uses punch cards tapes, originally used in computers to  control chemical reactions in microfluidic chambers, a kind of  programmable chemistry.

I thought only acting matteredUpdated: November 18, 2014 10:50 IST
‘I thought only acting mattered’
BHUMIKA K.
Hindi cinema
Parineeti Chopra wanted to play a larger-than-life role and experiment with her look. And Kill/Dil came just at the right time with the perfect role, she says
Enthusiasm might as well be her middle name. The chatty, down-to-earth Parineeti Chopra seemed to be on a constant high, breezing into Bangalore on a dank morning, saying ‘Hello everybody, how are you?’ like an old friend, waving about to the gathering and bestowing her brilliant smile upon us, proclaiming with gusto her love for her Kill/Dil co-stars Ranveer Singh and Ali Zafar. And at the end of the interview even apologises for having “dull energy levels today…my throat is gone”!
Parineeti Chopra, in her short career span of three years has grabbed attention for the kind of roles she’s played, films she’s picked, and the way she’s dressed… or not. In Bangalore last week to promote her latest flick, she talks, among other things, about how she initially thought it was enough to act well, but realised dressing well was as much a part of the Bollywood deal. Excerpts from an interview.
What about Kill/Dil made you pick the film?
I was looking for a film that would be different from my previous ones. I’ve always done films that have had a basis in reality.I wanted a film that was larger than life. And Kill/Dil came at the perfect time. I wanted to experiment with my look. A couple of big reasons made me jump at it.
So you mean glamour isn’t realistic?
Noooo! Not at all like that…when I said realistic may be I used the wrong word. I meant small-town – both in Ishaqzaade and Shuddh Desi Romance they were small-town roles. As a scientist in Hasee Toh Phasee I was wearing baggy oversized clothes. So it wasn’t really about glamour. This is larger than life. In this film I play a rich kid; so I have access to the best designer clothes, the best life, to go with my character. That’s what I meant. People in real life these days are very glamorous.
Coming to which, you’ve constantly been criticised for your “look” — the clothes and styling…
I think I’ve changed now. It used to be so in my first year. But I think this year, I’ve not had bad reviews for my clothes actually! All those fashion critics etc have said ‘She’s improved a lot’, which is a pat on my back. Because I’ve actually taken care of what I wear and what is my “look”, which I never used to do before. It is important to dress well in this industry. I thought acting would be the only thing that mattered. But it isn’t. So now I take care of it and don’t get panned for my dressing now.
You started off in this industry as a PR for Yash Raj Films. Looking back, are you happy with where you are now?
(Asks a staffer for a “doodh-wallah normal filter coffee, badey mug mein”). I need to wake up ya! What were we saying? Am I happy? A 100 per cent! I didn’t have a traditional big debut film. I held my own in my first film as one among four heroines.
Ishaqzaade gave me a National Award mention. I’ve learnt on the job, and given that history I’m very happy. Now that I’m learning about the industry, I can do better things. You have an image of being bubbly and enthusiastic. Has that worked to your advantage or has it been a limiting factorin finding roles?
Unfortunately, I’m asked this always, and when I answer people realise it’s not true. I am energetic and enthusiastic in real life. Only my first role was that of a bubbly girl, in Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, in which I played a loud Punjabi girl. After that Ishaqzaade I played an aggressive, fiery, strong, swearing, furious character. In Shuddh…
I was this laidback girl sleeping around with her boyfriend, smoking. In Hasee… I was a mad scientist…so actually I was not bubbly in any of my films. I don’t understand where that image has come from!
For Daawat-e-Ishq you did a lot of food tasting around the country. What is the one food memory that still stays with you after all these days?
None of the food that I ate was new. I’ve travelled a lot and eaten all kinds of Indian food. But yes, the meal I had at my home, which my mother cooked was the most memorable one because Aditya (Roy Kapoor, her co-star) and the whole crew whom we used to work with everyday was there. It has to be home food because you grow up on it.

Suicide car bomber hits Iraq Kurdish city  4 killedPrint

A suicide car bomber struck in the heart of the northern Iraqi Kurdish city of Irbil on Wednesday, killing at least four people, a spokesman said.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the midday attack near the ancient citadel in Irbil, capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq, though it bore the hallmarks of the Islamic State group.
Irbil has remained mostly calm, but it lies close to the front-lines in Iraq’s war against the Sunni militant group. The city has taken in thousands of refugees who fled the extremists’ summer blitz that captured large swaths of northern and western Iraq, as well as a third of neighboring Syria.

Three of the four people killed in Wednesday’s explosion were guards, said Hamza Hamid, a spokesman for the Irbil governor. The Iraqi Kurdish health ministry reported at least 22 were wounded.
Hamid said the attack took place “right in front of the main entrance of the building of Irbil governorate,” which is near the citadel.
Mayor Nawzad Hadi told the state-run Rudaw TV channel that the bomber tried to enter the citadel grounds but failed, so he detonated his explosives-laden car outside the complex.
The mayor said properties in the area suffered significant damage but it was unclear if the citadel, claimed to be one of the world’s longest continuously inhabited landmarks, was damaged. The hilltop castle has a history stretching back more than 8,000 years. In 2007, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, continued…

The Innovetors by Walter Issacson is poetical  scientificStory
Poetical, Scientific
Walter Isaacson, who wrote the Steve Jobs book, tells us that teamwork matters more than individual brilliance.
The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution
The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution
Walter Isaacson
Pages: 542, including notes and index
Those who handle the books sections of newspapers and magazines often wonder if the reviews they publish have been written after having read the book. The reviewers, though, will hear none of it.
This, therefore, is a review with a difference. The reviewer admits that he has not read the book, not all of it anyway. The excuse for that is a combination of his laziness and Walter Isaacson's meticulousness in compiling a 168-year timeline of the development of the computer and Internet. It is a joy to get lost in it. However, the reviewer has read enough of the book to divine that Ada, Countess of Lovelace never got her due.
That is not unique to her. In the history of technology, the contribution of hundreds has been consigned to the recycle bin, or deleted permanently. There is a thing called the Creation Myth in the Silicon Valley. These are tales of successes and failures somewhat based on the truth. They are largely happy stories shorn of the dark passages of chicanery, deceit and denied credit. Every other man has a sob story. However, in general, the lot of women has been worse. And it began at the beginning.
Lovelace, the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron, died in 1852 at the age of 36. Her father had died at the same age in 1824, when she was just nine.
Their association, though brief, was enough for Lord Byron to infuse in her some of his romance and rebelliousness. As a teenager she fell for one of her tutors and tried to run away to be with him. Her mother Annabella sought to rein her in by putting her into mathematics, which lead to a happy fusion that Ada liked to call poetical science.
She presented path-breaking notes on computing to Scientific Memoirs, an English scientific journal, in 1843. Disbelieving editors of the journal could not comprehend that a woman could write those notes. They thought Lovelace's colleague, Charles Babbage, was too coy to take credit.
This would be a good juncture to appeal to Sheryl Sandberg to take note; after all the Facebook COO is a modern day fountainhead of feminine awareness, telling women the world over to Lean In. But such an exhortation would be unnecessary. Sandberg has already taken note. She says in a New York Times article on how the book came to be: "Stereotypes are very reinforcing because as human beings we expect what is familiar. In tech, girls don't code because girls don't code."
All right, but a surprisingly large number of women did math 80 years ago. As many as 113 American women got their doctorate in math in the 1930s. That was 15 per cent of all American math doctorates. The number fell to 106, only 4 per cent, in the 1950s. Grace Hopper, who created the programming language Cobol and coined the term "computer bugs", obtained her math doctorate in 1934, the 11th American woman to get it from Yale, the first being in 1895.
Ada, though not a particularly gifted mathematician, towers above them all. In fact, the Lady Lovelace's Objection remains unconquered to this day, though many challenges have been posed to it.
It was Ada's contention that no computer, no matter how powerful, would ever truly be a thinking machine. Alan Turing, who was conceived in Chhatrapur, in India, and born in London in 1912, and who made seminal contributions to development of computers, sought to dismiss her objection by providing an operational definition of a thinking machine.
The leitmotif of Isaacson's book is teamwork - that most of the innovations of the digital age were done collaboratively.
But in the 60 years since then, all we have got is a computer that defeated Gary Kasparov and another that won Jeopardy. The real thinking machine remains confined to celluloid, most notably in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which has intelligent computer HAL, when threatened, killing his human masters one by one.
A real life HAL is yet to arrive. And that would please Ada, as would Isaacson's focus on her and her work.
However, another woman, Ayn Rand, the novelist-philosopher known for her belief in individual brilliance and her dislike for collectivism and altruism, would not be happy with Isaacson.
The leitmotif of Isaacson's book is teamwork - that most of the innovations of the digital age were done collaboratively. Isaacson has himself written much-acclaimed biographies of individuals, the best known of them being the one of Steve Jobs. In this book, though, he is determined to extol collaborative creativity, which, he believes, is how innovation actually happens in the real world.
This takes him headlong into the debate over whether the history of the world is a collection of biographies of great individuals or whether the role of societal forces is greater.
This book itself is a creation of collaboration, not all of it intended. The idea for it came to Isaacson when his daughter Betsy, after much pestering by her parents, wrote a college essay on Ada.
Isaacson was stunned into silence when the daughter revealed her subject. He was about to start work on the Jobs book and could not recall who Ada was.
Once he started working on this book, he wanted to make it about the evolution of the Internet. It was Bill Gates who, during an interview, convinced Isaacson that the simultaneous emergence of the personal computer and the Internet was a more compelling story.
Still, for all of Isaacson's belief in collaborative creativity, his liking for some individuals, most notably Ada, comes through every now and then. He both begins and ends the book with her.
Talking about endings, now that this review is done, let's finish reading the book.
Isaacson is determined to extol collaborative creativity, which, he believes, is how innovation actually happens in the real world.

Vijay Hazare Trophy: Wasim Jaffer sends Mumbai through to quarters  Delhi homeBy: Press Trust of India | Rajkot | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:15 pm
Veteran batsman Wasim Jaffer played a perfect innings in a modest chase as Mumbai outclassed Delhi by six wickets to enter quarter-final of the National One Day Championship for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.
Mumbai will meet defending champions Karnataka in the quarter-finals.
Mumbai captain Suryakumar Yadav won a good toss and his bowlers responded brilliantly, bowling out Delhi for 157 in 42.3 overs. Virender Sehwag (9) and Gautam Gambhir (22) ‘s saga of failures continued as Delhi never looked like being in the match.
In reply, Mumbai maintained a steady tempo without taking undue risks, courtesy Jaffer as he struck an unbeaten 83 off 87 balls to take his team to victory in 30.3 overs. His customary on-drives were a treat to watch as all the bowlers including the seasoned Ashish Nehra were guilty of bowling on his pads.
Jaffer’s innings had 11 boundaries and a six and his sequence of scores in the tournament now read: 83, 37, 84, 60 and 83 no.
“Whatever remaining years I have in first-class cricket, I would like to continue scoring runs. After having played Test cricket, it is important to have the motivation to continue doing well in first class. I still have the motivation to perform for Mumbai,” a pragmatic Jaffer said at the end of the match.
The 9am start did help the Mumbai bowlers as there was a bit of assistance from the pitch, complemented by good bounce.
Unmukt Chand (6) tried to glance Shardul Thakur and was caught down the leg side by Aditya Tare — a decision that didn’t make the batsman happy. Unmukt has failed to total 50 after six matches.
Sehwag (9) did hit a couple of boundaries off pacers. An on-drive and a pull had Sehwag signature all over it but Thakur squared up the legend with one that moved a shade and took an outside edge straight into Surya’s hands in the slips.
Gambhir (22) hit a few boundaries before he perished due to age-old technical malaise of trying the dab shot down third-man off Wilkin Mota only to find Tare taking an outstanding diving catch.
Milind Kumar (64 off 94 balls) was the highest scorer but he consumed far too many balls and the number of dot balls that he played only increased the pressure. Rajat Bhatia (12) was run-out while Puneet Bisht (12) played an irresponsible aerial sweep shot off Akhil Herwadkar.
In the end, 158 wasn’t a big target and Mumbai cruised to the target with ease.
Brief Scores: Delhi 157 in 42.3 overs (Milind Kumar 64, Shardul Tahkur 3/25) Mumbai 158/4 (Wasim Jaffer 83 no, Akhil Herwadkar 30) Mumbai win by 6 wkts.
Quarter-final: Karnataka vs Mumbai.
Harbhajan leads Punjab to quarters
Captain Harbhajan Singh led from the front with an all-round effort as Punjab coasted to a comfortable 29-run win against Gujarat in the pre-quarterfinals of the Vijay Hazare one-day tournament.
Punjab will meet Railways in the quarter-finals. Put into bat at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground, Punjab rode fine fifties from Amitoze Singh (75), Gurkeerat Singh Mann (72) continued…

Godhra train burning convict on death row jumps parolePrint
By: Express News Service | Vadodara | Posted: November 19, 2014 6:57 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 7:00 pm
Salim Zarda, who was awarded death penalty in the Godhra train burning case, jumped parole leading the Vadodara Central jail to sound an alert. Zarda, who was among the 11 sentenced to death in the February 27, 2002 Sabarmati express carnage case in which 59 persons were burnt to death, had got parole from the Gujarat High Court on the ground that he needed to be present at home in Godhra to build the collapsed roof of his house. The 15-day parole ended Tuesday.
Another convict Bilal Abdulla Badam who is serving a life term in the same case, was attacked when on parole to attend the funeral rites of his mother. His parole ends November 21.
Vadodara central jail authorities said that Zarda was required to turn up by Tuesday after his parole term ended but did not show up and hence they have alerted Godhra police as well as railway police to arrest him and bring him back.
“He was supposed to be back by Tuesday. Now, he has jumped his parole so we have written to Godhra SP and railway police to look out for him and bring him back to the jail,” a jail official said.
The lawyer who had moved his parole request before the high court, Deepak Sindhi, said that Zarda was granted parole after a government official stood as his guarantor. He had also deposited a security money of Rs 1 lakh before the court.
“Zarda had sought parole on the ground that he was required to be present during the construction of his ancestral house where his family lives. I am not aware if he has moved request for extension of his parole. If the court grants him extension, the jail authorities may come to know about it only after a few days,” Sindhi said.
Badam had sought a 15-day parole after his mother passed away and was required to surrender before the jail on November 21. He had sought another week-long extension of his parole from the high court. According to the FIR, Badam was on Tuesday night attacked by three persons, one identified as Mohsin Mamji, who tried to loot his motorcycle.
The incident took place at around 11:30 in the night when Badam was at the house of his in-laws at Bhukri Palot locality. Three persons barged into their house and started asking for the keys of his motorcycle. When he refused, they attacked him with sharp weapon and injured his hand. He is currently undergoing treatment at Godhra civil hospital.
A special court had awarded death sentence to eleven convicts in March 2011 and awarded life imprisonment to twenty-one others while 63 accused were released. A convict, Shaukat Patadia died in 2012 while serving life imprisonment, while four other accused were granted permanent bail in 2013.
Remaining convicts are lodged in Vadodara central jail.

High Court slams police  Home Ministry for poor policing in DelhiIn the suo motu case taken up after the December 16 gangrape case, the court had been informed that police strength had to be increased, but the decision hasn't been taken so far.
Written by Aneesha Mathur | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 6:57 pm
The Delhi High Court on Wednesday came down heavily on city police and the Home Ministry, saying there is no policing in the National Capital. “The Home Ministry and Delhi police are ‘playing badminton’ with issue of appointment of 14,000 police personnel,” the court made this caustic remark.
In the suo motu case taken up after the December 16 gangrape case, the court had been informed that police strength had to be increased, but the decision hasn’t been taken so far. On Wednesday, the counsel for the Ministry of Home Affairs said that the Centre has told Delhi police to ‘review’ the number of people to be appointed. Court of justice Badar Durrez Ahmed and justice Siddharth Mridul pulled up the bureaucracy for lack of proper policing in Delhi.
In a related PIL on women’s safety, the court also asked the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to monitor whether the Delhi police crime teams actually carry the scientific investigation kits to crime scenes. The court observed, “I have never seen a proper investigation kit in any of the cases.”

Israel demolished the east Jerusalem home of a Palestinian who carried out a deadly October attack, just hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised strict security measures in the wake of a grisly synagogue assault a day earlier.
The synagogue attack, which left five people dead, was the deadliest in Jerusalem since 2008 and came amid weeks of violence linked to a disputed holy site sacred to Jews and Muslims. Nearly a dozen people have been killed in attacks by Palestinians using guns, knives and vehicles.
The house demolished in the Silwan neighborhood near the Old City belonged to Abdel Rahman al-Shaludi, who killed two people last month when he drove his car into a crowd standing on a light rail platform in Jerusalem.

Kylin s SkyBar offers fantastic bar foodPrachi Bhuchar        Edition: Oct 26, 2014
Dimsums, Prawn sesame and Spring onion
Kylin is an old name on the Delhi Asian circuit and over the years it has built a strong reputation for itself as a restaurant that's consistently good and delivers big flavours.
While the restaurant at the Ambience Mall, Vasant Kunj is tried and tested, the SkyBar is only gaining prominence now. The new menu at the bar that allows you to drink and eat al fresco gets two thumbs up.
Between October and February, with the weather in Delhi at its best, outdoor spots are coveted spaces and this once checks most boxes. For one, it is spacious and you don't feel hemmed in.
Also, the bar looks casual yet chic and the drinks menu is a good mix of heady cocktails and regular peg measures. Begin with the wasabi prawn which is creamy with a good wasabi hit and you can skip the crystal dumpling prawn sesame and spring onion which is quite average.
If there is one must have on the menu it has to be the pork belly yakitori which has a hint of charcoal and just dissolves into nothing in your mouth. Truly fantastic.
Yakitori and Robata Grill, Pork Belly
There's also some sushi on the menu that completes the Asian circuit and does justice to the Japanese favourite. The rolls are ell constructed and the flavours just right.
The new menu at the bar is heavy on starters and one would do well to stick to the wide range on offer. Yet, if you have been sitting around for a long time and are feeling more than a little peckish, order off the mains section of the menu and you won't be disappointed.
While the meals in a bowl are full of flavour, they are not out of the ordinary and you might do well to order a burger or one of the dim sum baskets instead which are spot on. You also have the option of some live cooking at your table but if you prefer some privacy, give it a miss and stick to other favourites from the menu.
I would definitely go back for the interesting drinks and fantastic bar food. It also helps that the music is fun, the service is attentive and the overall look and feel of the space is casual. Highly recommended for an evening out with friends.

Firms need to find ways to repay their debtStory
The Age of Deleveraging
The level of corporate leverage for India is among the highest among emerging economies as shown by IMF studies.
Rajesh Mokashi     Delhi   Edition: Nov 9, 2014
Rajesh Mokashi/ Deputy Managing Director, CARE Ratings
The Indian economy's powerful performance in the years prior to 2012/13 prompted companies to take on debt to finance expansion plans. However, with economic conditions not having panned out as hoped, companies got saddled with high levels of growth-inhibiting debt. This requires them to find ways to repay their debt. The level of corporate leverage for India is among the highest among emerging economies as shown by IMF studies.
The high debt levels have not only bought companies under severe stress, it has also bought to the fore concerns of economic stability and the growth trajectory of the country, given that Indian banks have been bearing the brunt of the stressed corporate debt. Growth in debt issuances has slowed down as has bank credit due to a combination of slow economic growth as well as caution exercised by companies in borrowing funds. Weighed down by high levels of non-performing corporate debt, banks have been less willing to lend, as evidenced by the low growth in bank credit. This, in turn, has a bearing on fresh investments and on India's economic prospects.
An analysis of 1,812 non-financial companies showed that aggregate debt had been growing 13 per cent annually between 2010/11 and 2013/14, barring 2011/12 when it rose 18 per cent. Cumulatively, the debt of these companies increased 51 per cent during the four-year period. The growth in aggregate net worth (equity + reserves) of these companies fell from 16.3 per cent in 2010/11 to 8.6 per cent in 2012/13. The debt-to-equity ratio has increased from 0.58 in 2010/11 to 0.67 in 2013/14.
The number of companies that have been deleveraging has been rising in the last four years, from 33 per cent of the companies in 2010/11 (of the sample of 1,812 non-financial companies) to 38 per cent in 2013/14. In volume terms, companies have reduced their debts by 43 per cent, 13 per cent and 38 per cent in 2011/12, 2012/13 and 2013/14.
Indian companies have been reducing their debt levels in an attempt to improve their business performance and credit profile. They are taking a number of steps to achieve this. For instance, companies have been restructuring business operations to maximise revenue and profitability. This has been directed to ultimately lowering the debt component. They have also been using cash balances and selling off their assets (usually non-core) to lower their debt.
Companies are also raising funds by way of stake sales and issue of shares and other financial instruments such as global depository receipts. Replacing such debt has had a positive impact on the balance sheets. Companies are also seen opting for debt restructuring and takeout financing by replacing costly debt with low-cost funds from global markets.
The measures have been bearing fruit as the credit quality of companies has seen a noticeable improvement in recent times (since the fourth quarter of 2013/14 and particularly in the second quarter of 2014/15). The credit ratings (upgrades, downgrades and reaffirmations) assigned by ratings agencies to companies provide evidence of this improvement. CARE Ratings' modified credit ratio (MCR), which helps measure mobility in ratings (an increase in the MCR implies stable and improving credit quality of the rated entities), has risen to a three-year high in the second quarter of 2014/15. This ratio was below 1 (indicating more downgrades as compared to upgrades) from the fourth quarter of 2011/12 to the first quarter of 2013/14, reflecting the deterioration in credit quality of companies. Given that CARE rates a large and diverse set of entities, the movement of MCR can be regarded as being indicative of the general business and economic environment of the country.
However, challenges remain as using the asset sale route to deleveraging tends to be time consuming and liquidity concerns have to be addressed in the interim period. The recent spurt in the stock markets has opened an additional window for promoters willing to dilute equity through a preferential issue of shares at a premium.

A week after it introduced the 'read receipt' feature in the form of two blue ticks, messaging app WhatsApp has introduced the option to disable it.
The update, however, is available only to Android users who have downloaded the new beta version of the app.
A week ago, WhatsApp had started notifying users when their messages were read by the receiver by way of two blue ticks alongside the message. However, the feature didn't get a positive response from users as many thought it invaded privacy by not giving them the option of ignoring messages.
The latest update from WhatsApp would be much welcome. To disable the feature, Android users can go to the privacy option in their app settings and disable the 'Read Receipts' option.

Facebook is secretly working on a new website called "Facebook at Work" that would allow users to keep their personal profile separate from their work profile, the Financial Times has reported.
The new website, that will look very much like Facebook , will compete with professional social network LinkedIn, Google, and Microsoft, the newspaper said.
Facebook's new site will allow users to chat with colleagues, connect with professional contacts and collaborate over documents, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified sources.
Facebook was not available for comment outside regular US business hours.
Facebook employees have long used the site in their daily work and the social networking site is now testing it with companies, the newspaper said.

E-commerce firms race ahead  retailers hobbleE-commerce firms race ahead, retailers hobble

Kishore Biyani, the head of Future Group , one of country's largest and most established retailers, admits he can't keep up with web sites like Snapdeal and Flipkart when it comes to spending money to entice shoppers to buy online.
Private investors have poured $2.3 billion into country's e-commerce companies so far this year, according to consulting firm Technopak, giving them financial firepower to overwhelm shoppers with bargains and deals that brick-and-mortar retailers like Future Group, which runs a host of chains including Future Retail and Future Lifestyle Fashions, cannot match.
"It's all about money. The e-commerce guys have money to experiment - I don't have this kind of money to blow," Kishore Biyani , who pioneered modern retail in the country and is chief executive of the Future Group, told Reuters in an interview.
In an attempt to match up, traditional retailers are forging partnerships with well-funded websites such as Flipkart.com, Amazon.com and Snapdeal to put their wares on the web without investing heavily in their own online infrastructure.
This tentative approach to e-commerce, however, leaves traditional retailers vulnerable to being completely overtaken by their better-funded online rivals in a country where a rapidly expanding middle class is doing more and more shopping on the web.
In October, Future Group tied up with Amazon's Indian arm to sell its brands online. A month earlier, electronics retailer Croma, owned by the Tata Group, struck a similar arrangement with Snapdeal .
According to Technopak, organized retail in India is expected to grow to $182 billion in 2020 from the current $46 billion. E-tailing is forecast to expand at a faster clip, to $32 billion by 2020 from $2.3 billion now.
India's protectionist government policies have long shielded established retailers from competition. As a result, they never felt the need to invest in state-of-the-art technology, said Bhavit Desai, a US-based strategy consultant who has worked with companies such as Walmart International, the global unit of Wal-mart Stores, and Target.
"Many huge players in the market have invested very little in technology and have been followers at best," Desai said.
MOM-AND-POP TO ONLINE SALES
In 2012, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government opened the retail industry to foreign operators, allowing companies such as Wal-Mart and Tesco to own majority stakes in Indian chains for the first time.
But the government left it to individual states to decide whether to let in foreign retailers. Few have stepped up, and the big foreign chains that might have shared their online expertise with India's stores are largely absent.
Instead, local online marketplaces have proliferated, backed by billions of dollars coming in primarily from abroad. Last month's $627 million investment by Japan's SoftBank Corp in Snapdeal illustrated a widening gap. The portal has also attracted funds from eBay and billionaire Ratan Tata.
Flipkart.com raised $1 billion earlier this year, in a round of funding from Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, along with existing investors Tiger Global Management LLC and South African media company Naspers.
That leaves traditional Indian retailers vulnerable, say industry advisers. Online marketplaces don't need to pay high commercial rents or build stores to serve India's 1.3 billion people, and they're soaking up outside investments and expertise from their international backers that can help them move faster to profit.
Organised retail is still developing in India. More than 90 per cent of shopping is done at informal roadside shacks and in bazaars. These small shops are seen as the lifeblood of the economy and successive governments have protected them.
But the same policies have also shielded much larger players like Shoppers Stop, Future Retail and others. At the same time, online stores are racing ahead, modernising the retail industry at a pace that traditional chains cannot match.
"It is exactly like what happened in telecoms," said Harminder Sahni, managing director of Wazir Advisors. "In India, we never took landlines to every single home - mobiles came in and leapfrogged that."

Lenovo Vibe X2 review: The best smartphone at Rs 20 000. PeriodPrint
Lenovo Vibe X2 is the best smartphone around the Rs 20,000 price point at the moment.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: November 18, 2014 5:22 pm | Updated: November 25, 2014 11:06 am
It is almost as if smartphones too have stars. And once in a while these stars line up in perfect combination to result in a device that ticks most of the boxes. I believe Lenovo has been able to achieve it with the next Vibe X2, what it calls the world’s first layered phone. Here is why I think this phone has been able to achieve the sweet spot.
Specs: 5-inch IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen (1080x1920p, ~441 ppi) | MediatTek MT6595m 2.0 GHz True8Core Octa-core processor | 2 GB RAM | 32GB internal (no external memory) | 13MP rear camera + 5MP front camera | 4G dual SIM (micro + Nano) | 2300 mAh battery | Android 4.4 with Vibe UI
Price: Rs 19,999
Design: The Vibe X2 claims to be the first layered phone in the world. And I have to agree, having never seen a phone that has so many layers on it. The model that has come to India moves from gold to shades of orange in three layers followed by the display layer. Lenovo is giving a protective rear panel in the rear which adds another layers.
Overall the phone looks a bit like Bob Marley’s headgear. I personally like the black shade combination, but that has not made it to India so far. Plus, you can add additional battery and speaker layers. The batter layer adds bulk, but it also doubles the power on the phone. I am not sure about the extra speaker layer when you have so many affordable Bluetooth speakers in the market, however I will not mind an extra camera layers that adds zoom and macro capabilities.
Display: The Lenovo Vibe X2 has a Full HD display which is crystal clear and crisp. It also works perfectly well in bright sunlight as you can really push up the brightness almost overpowering the reflections from the sun above. At this price point you don’t have many other manufacturers offering Full HD.
Performance: I can keep harping about the layers of the design, but then that is superficial. In the end it all trickles down to performance and what experience it gives the users. This is where the Vibe X2 is a big winner if you ask me. The MT6595m True8Core processor is MediatTek’s way of showing the world that it has now become big enough to try something that will give the Qualcomms and Intels a run for their money. In fact, if you like looking at benchmark scores, then this one betters any other phones listed with a score that is at least 30 per cent. But then a benchmark score is no good if it does not make life better for the user. But you will have no complaints with the X2, as the performance is smooth and powerful. There was not one instance where I thought this phone was lagging behind the flagship phones in any way. This could be the most powerful phone around, certainly in this price range.
Software: A lot of people don’t like manufacturers tweaking the Android experience. So the Vibe UI on this phone could be an issue with some users. Having used the phone for over a week I am convinced that it is just the first week that you will be fighting with the muscle memory inside that is looking for familiar icons and patterns. I would have liked an app draw instead of having all the apps on the homescreen like iOS. But Vibe UI has a better notification tray than stock Android. Plus, the new feature that lets you access most used app from the lock screen itself which is a very handy feature. However, this cannot be finetuned to have the apps that you want, which might not always be the most used apps. Then you can click a phone even from the lock screen and the phone open only after the snap has been recorded. So no missing those precious moments with this phone.
Camera: The camera is decent, but not great. It is fast and click when you have to. There are a lot of tweaks you can do before clicking a picture though there is no manual mode.
I used the settings to change the saturation and contrast before shooting and the results were very good. However, some photos were too saturates and colours bled when shooting red flowers. The selfie camera is clear, though it flattens images a bit too much. But overall, this camera is good for the price range.
Storage: The phone comes with 32GB storage, but no external storage slot. You have about 25GB storage to use and that is more that enough if you ask me.
Connectivity: The phone has dual SIM slots, one for micro SIM and another for nano. There were no issues with connectivity.
Battery: The 2300 mAh battery is good to go for the entire day. But remember to keep the brightness of the screen at auto as the full brightness will drain your battery real quick.
Verdict: In my books the Lenovo Vibe X2 is the best smartphone around the Rs 20,000 price point at the moment. Actually, the phone would have flown off the shelves even at a slightly higher price point. The phone that comes closest as far as specs go is the Nexus 5 which is at least 50 per cent more expensive and still is short on some features. Lenovo has a winner, till others catch up.

The personal warmth the Australian PM shared with Modi was reflected yet again at a reception at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground on Tuesday.
“Narendra and I.” Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said this at a joint press conference with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi after summit talks, while stressing how the two countries were expanding their cooperation in various areas.
The personal warmth Abbott shared with Modi was reflected yet again at a reception at the iconic 161-year-old Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) where he said Modi is like a “brother.”
“Narendra and I,” said Abbott on couple of occasions while referring to the determination of the two leaders to work together to help strengthening of relations.
Abbott had urged world leaders to speak from the heart rather than a script at the summit of the Group of 20 industrialised and major emerging economies at Brisbane.
“If we could use first names, that would be good as well because, whatever disagreements we might have, it helps if there can at least be personal warmth amongst us,” he said.
When Modi, the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Australia in 28 years after Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, made his entry at the G20 Summit venue, he gave Abbott a hearty hug.
Before Modi began his address to lawmakers on Tuesday, Abbott said he was determined to correct the situation where no Indian Prime Minister had addressed the Australian parliament.
He said leaders of several countries have addressed the Parliament but no Indian leader has done it.
“I am personally delighted that this has been been corrected,” Abbott said.
The two leaders had several meetings — both formally and informally — during the East Asia Summit and at the G20 Summit.
“My memorable visit to Australia ends today. A new relationship has begun,” Modi said while speaking at the MCG.
At the end of his four—city Australia tour, Modi gifted a memento to Australia signed by World Cup winning Indian captains and himself.

Nokia plots comeback with N1 Android tabletIndian rupee slips from 2-week high; down 6 paise at 61.83 against dollar
Nokia is back in the fray. Just months after selling its ailing handsets business to Microsoft, the Finnish company is planning to go back into the consumer market with a new tablet.
The former top mobile phone maker, which has a history of reinventing itself since it began as a paper maker in the 19th century, said Tuesday it will launch a 7.9-inch device early next year in China, the world’s biggest market, before selling it elsewhere.
The device will be manufactured by Taiwan-based Foxconn, which makes Apple’s handsets. And it will operate Android instead of the Windows software Nokia used on its cellphones when it began a partnership with Microsoft in 2011. That partnership ended unsuccessfully – in April
Nokia sold its cellphones unit to Microsoft for $7.2 billion.
Sebastian Nystrom, head of at Nokia’s technologies unit, described the N1 tablet as ”a new beginning for Nokia.”
He noted that about 80 percent of the world’s mobile consumers use Android, compared with just 2.5 percent using Windows mobile devices. The aluminum-cased tablet uses Google’s Android Lollipop operating system, and will retail for some $250.
For sure, it won’t be an easy shift for Nokia after years of focusing on cellphones and a troubled networks operation that only recently has shown signs of improvement.
”It’s pointing in the right direction, but there are some real challenges,” said Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics, near London. ”It doesn’t have the distribution channels that others like Samsung and Apple enjoy, and nobody is making any profits in Android tablets at the moment.”
But Nokia, established in 1865, has demonstrated an ability to transform itself.
Named after the small southern Finland town where it was based, it evolved its paper making business into a rubber boots and cable maker before becoming an electronics company. Then it hit on mobile telephony that made it almost synonymous with wireless high-tech, reaching a peak of 40 percent market share in mobile phone sales worldwide in 2008.
But, after holding the No.1 spot in cellphones for 14 years, it wasn’t able to meet the challenge when Apple in 2007 introduced the iPhone, and also began to lose the competition to cheaper Asian manufacturers.
After completing the sale of its mobile phone unit to Microsoft, Nokia has focused on its three, much more profitable operations: networks, HERE mapping services and software.
It is one of the few computerized roadmap providers in the world and the only one with a long history of working with automotive companies. HERE has an 80 percent market share for embedded automotive maps.
Nokia’s brand was wiped out of the handset market last week, when Microsoft unveiled its first Lumia smartphone under its own brand name.
”We are pleased to bring the Nokia brand back into consumers’ hands,” said Nystrom, who announced the launch of the tablet in Helsinki at Slush, one of Europe’s largest startup and investor events with some 10,000 participants expected over two days.
He hinted Nokia was also interested in producing an Android smartphone. That can’t happen before 2016, however, as the Microsoft deal included a commitment that Nokia not enter the smartphone business before then.
”Once that is finalized we have the option to do so,” Nystrom told the AP.
Nokia’s share price closed up more than 3 percent at 6.41 euros in Helsinki.

India-Sri Lanka
 A decision on the probable pardon of the five Indian fishermen on death row can be expected in due course, the Sri Lankan government said on Wednesday.
“The Indian High Commission has informed the President’s office about the withdrawal of the appeal made on behalf of the fishermen. A decision will be taken in due course,” Presidential spokesperson Mohan Samaranayake told The Hindu Wednesday morning.  
Following the October 30 judgment of the Colombo High Court, sentencing to death five Indian fishermen in an alleged case of drug trafficking, the Indian government made efforts through legal and diplomatic channels for a possible pardon. New Delhi, The Hindu earlier reported, has been pushing at the highest levels for a full pardon.  
Last week, ministers in President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s government had announced that the President was ready to pardon the fishermen if the appeal made by the Indian side was withdrawn. The President’s office, meanwhile, maintained that no decision had been taken on the pardon of the fishermen or the commutation of their sentence.
Spokesperson Mohan Samaranayake had however said one of the steps in the process was the withdrawal of the appeal.
New Delhi has maintained that the five fishermen are innocent as per available GPS data. On Tuesday, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj assured a fishermen delegation in New Delhi that the Indian government would secure the release of the five fishermen.

IBM introduces Verse enterprise email platformIBM Verse brings in analytics and social collaboration to enterprise email.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: November 20, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 20, 2014 12:44 am
IBM has launched a new enterprise mailing service in India called Verse. The new e-mail application aims to deliver relevant content to users and integrates services like e-mail, meetings, calendars, file sharing, instant messaging, social updates, video chats into a single platform. Verse is currently in its beta stage and a freemium version will be released next year on IBM’s Cloud Marketplace.
“With IBM Mail Next, we’ve applied analytics to enterprise email and bring in social collaboration experience with focus on engaging people and driving outcomes, not managing messages and inboxes,” said Anmol Nautiyal, IBM Social Business and IBM Smarter Workforce Director.
IBM Verse is mostly targeted at enterprises which needs to collaborate more among teams especially in  SMEs and knowledge centric organisations. Verse is delivered on the SoftLayer cloud promising enterprise-grade security and will be also offered as an app for both iOS and Android to ensure similar user experience.
“Going forward, Verse will be hosted on data centres in India,” said Anmol Nautiyal, IBM Social Business and IBM Smarter Workforce Director. “The development team is working on bringing offline capabilties to it and is looking forward to integrate Verse on Apple’s iOS 8 soon.”
IBM Verse uses analytics to provide an ‘at-a-glance’ view, which brings in the user’s most critical actions for the day. The paltformn considers unique employee preferences and priorities over time and provides instant context about a given project as well as the people and teams collaborating on it. IBM claims that its analytics doesn’t mine a user’s inbox to increase advertising and monetize that data in other ways.
Clients using IBM Verse will also have the future option to embed a Watson feature which enables users to query Watson on a given topic and receive a direct reply with answers ranked by degree of confidence.
In July 2014, IBM launched a partnership with Apple to develop a new class of industry specific business apps to transform enterprise mobility. In September, IBM unveiled Watson Analytics to put powerful yet easy-to-use predictive and visual analytics tools in the palm of your hand, and in October launched Navigator to boost personal and team productivity by allowing users to easily and securely access, edit and share business documents.
Most recently, the company formed a global partnership with Twitter to transform how businesses understand customers, markets and trends by using Twitter data to make more informed decisions.

Ask Matt: Is the Nasdaq s rise a worryTV screen capture
Q: Is the Nasdaq’s rise a worry?
A: Investors have good reason to be concerned  when they hear the Nasdaq is at its highest level since March 2000. Investors who bought in then sat on dead money for 14 years.
Other major market measures keep blowing past old highs all year. But the Nasdaq is still about 7% below its peak of 5048.62 notched in March 2000. Back in March 2000, risky tech stocks were household names and speculating on money-losing companies was normal.  So the fact the Nasdaq is nearing that level gets some investors nervous. The Nasdaq Composite index Tuesday rose 31.44 points to 4,702.44.
But remember the Nasdaq is in a much different place now than it was then. Then, many of the most valuable companies in the index had skyhigh valuations, lost money or didn’t even have revenue. Some companies like Pets.com even spent bundles advertising – creating the famous sock puppet mascot – but failed to have a business model that worked. Following the tech-stock crash, many of these companies with broken business models burned through cash and vanished. Meanwhile, new tech companies that make money, like Google and Facebook, have risen and contributed to the earnings power.
The result? There are just six stocks in the tech sector of the Standard’s & Poor’s 500 that trigger two key “overvalued” metrics of exceeding  analysts’ 18-month price targets and exceeding the present value of future cash flows.

Cop arrested for molesting school girl in Arunachal townPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 20, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 20, 2014 12:24 am
A police officer of the rank of an Sub-Inspector was arrested following allegations of molesting a school girl in Roing, headquarter town of Lower Dibang Valley district in Arunachal Pradesh. He has been booked under Section 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.
Stating this Lower Dibang Valley district SP Rajneesh Gupta said while the police officer allegedly molested the Class X girl who was on her way to school Tuesday morning, he has been arrested and also placed under suspension.
“A magistrate has already recorded the victim’s statement, while necessary medical examinations have been also conducted immediately. We are submitting the chargesheet in connection with the case as early as possible in order to ensure speedy justice,” the SP told The Indian Express over the telephone from Roing on Wednesday.
Local sources said the girl was on her way to attend a private tuition when the police officer allegedly lured her into his official quarter on the pretext of asking for help in operating his new mobile phone. The girl, who regularly passes by the officer’s quarter did not doubt his intentions, but was molested once she entered his house, sources said. The girl, who managed to get out of the house, immediately informed the local unit of All Idu Mishmi Students’ Union (AIMSU), whose president Lokha Elapra in turn lodged an FIR in the Roing police station.
Ironically, the police officer arrested for the alleged sexual abuse of the girl was supposed to attend an Art of Living camp that began in Roing Tuesday. Organised by the district administration, the camp is being atttended by teachers, high school students, parents, other citizens as well as police officers. The camp is discussing issues related to drug abuse, alcoholism, sexual abuse of children, and other social malaises.
Meanwhile, Gumri Ringu, who has just relinquished her office as chairperson of the Arunachal Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (APSCPCR), while condemning the incident, has demanded exemplary punishment to the police officer involved in the incident. “There should be zero tolerance in this case where a police officer who is expected to protect children and other citizens had committed such a heinous crime,” Ringu, also president of Arunachal Pradesh Women Welfare Society, said.
Ringu said number of such incidents of sexual abuse of children has been increasing in the hill state. “Many such cases have gone unreported in recent times. Cases of sexual abuse and exploitation of children, especially girls, are rampant in schools run by both Christian and Hindu missionaries,” Ringu alleged.
It was only last month that the Lower Dibang Valley district administration had constituted a district-level committee headed by the SP to look into cases related to sexual abuse and exploitation of children, especially in schools. Principals and headmasters were also asked to verify character-related antecedents of all employees including teachers, and also conduct awareness programmes involving upper class students with the help of NGOs and counselors.

Godhra train burning convict on death row jumpsparolePrint
By: Express News Service | Vadodara | Posted: November 19, 2014 6:57 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 7:00 pm
Salim Zarda, who was awarded death penalty in the Godhra train burning case, jumped parole leading the Vadodara Central jail to sound an alert. Zarda, who was among the 11 sentenced to death in the February 27, 2002 Sabarmati express carnage case in which 59 persons were burnt to death, had got parole from the Gujarat High Court on the ground that he needed to be present at home in Godhra to build the collapsed roof of his house. The 15-day parole ended Tuesday.
Another convict Bilal Abdulla Badam who is serving a life term in the same case, was attacked when on parole to attend the funeral rites of his mother. His parole ends November 21.
Vadodara central jail authorities said that Zarda was required to turn up by Tuesday after his parole term ended but did not show up and hence they have alerted Godhra police as well as railway police to arrest him and bring him back.
“He was supposed to be back by Tuesday. Now, he has jumped his parole so we have written to Godhra SP and railway police to look out for him and bring him back to the jail,” a jail official said.
The lawyer who had moved his parole request before the high court, Deepak Sindhi, said that Zarda was granted parole after a government official stood as his guarantor. He had also deposited a security money of Rs 1 lakh before the court.
“Zarda had sought parole on the ground that he was required to be present during the construction of his ancestral house where his family lives. I am not aware if he has moved request for extension of his parole. If the court grants him extension, the jail authorities may come to know about it only after a few days,” Sindhi said.
Badam had sought a 15-day parole after his mother passed away and was required to surrender before the jail on November 21. He had sought another week-long extension of his parole from the high court. According to the FIR, Badam was on Tuesday night attacked by three persons, one identified as Mohsin Mamji, who tried to loot his motorcycle.
The incident took place at around 11:30 in the night when Badam was at the house of his in-laws at Bhukri Palot locality. Three persons barged into their house and started asking for the keys of his motorcycle. When he refused, they attacked him with sharp weapon and injured his hand. He is currently undergoing treatment at Godhra civil hospital.
A special court had awarded death sentence to eleven convicts in March 2011 and awarded life imprisonment to twenty-one others while 63 accused were released. A convict, Shaukat Patadia died in 2012 while serving life imprisonment, while four other accused were granted permanent bail in 2013.
Remaining convicts are lodged in Vadodara central jail.

High Court slams police  Home Ministry for poor policing inDelhiIn the suo motu case taken up after the December 16 gangrape case, the court had been informed that police strength had to be increased, but the decision hasn't been taken so far.
Written by Aneesha Mathur | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 6:57 pm
The Delhi High Court on Wednesday came down heavily on city police and the Home Ministry, saying there is no policing in the National Capital. “The Home Ministry and Delhi police are ‘playing badminton’ with issue of appointment of 14,000 police personnel,” the court made this caustic remark.
In the suo motu case taken up after the December 16 gangrape case, the court had been informed that police strength had to be increased, but the decision hasn’t been taken so far. On Wednesday, the counsel for the Ministry of Home Affairs said that the Centre has told Delhi police to ‘review’ the number of people to be appointed. Court of justice Badar Durrez Ahmed and justice Siddharth Mridul pulled up the bureaucracy for lack of proper policing in Delhi.
In a related PIL on women’s safety, the court also asked the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to monitor whether the Delhi police crime teams actually carry the scientific investigation kits to crime scenes. The court observed, “I have never seen a proper investigation kit in any of the cases.”

Jolla raises more than their crowdfunding goal in a day for SailfishtabletJolla has raised over their goal of $380,000 on Indiegogo within a day for the Jolla Saifish tablet.

Jolla, a Finnish startup company formed by ex-Nokia employees, is looking forward to launch their first tablet based on Sailfish operating system. Jolla has started a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to manufacture the tablet and have raised more than their goal of $380,000 within a day.
Jolla compares its upcoming Sailfish 2.0 tablet with iPad Mini 3, Nexus 9 and Nokia N1 and promises to deliver the same specs, if not more, at a lower price starting at USD 189. Interested buyers will need to add an extra USD 20 shipping charges. The first tablets will be shipped in May 2015.
The Jolla tablet will sport a 7.85-inch 2048×1536 pixels display at a density of 330ppi. Running on the gesture-based Sailfish 2.0 operating system, the tablet will run on a 1.8GHz quad-core (64-bit) Intel processor with 2GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage which will be expandable via microSD card.
Powered by a 4300mAh, the WiFi only Jolla tablet mounts a 5 MP rear camera at the back and a 2 MP on the front camera. It will weigh 384 grams and will come with Bluetooth, Micro-USB, GPS, accelerometer, light sensor, and proximity sensor.
The Jolla Tablet is currently available in EU, Norway, Switzerland, United States, India, China, Hong Kong, and Russia.

2100 could be next stop for S&P 5002100 could be next stop for S&P 500

The record-setting stock market is on the fast track, and the next stop could be 2100 on the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.
So says Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Frederick notes that the stock market continues to hit fresh highs, including the S&P 500’s 43rd record close of the year Tuesday. The large-company stock index rose 10.48 points, or 0.5%, to 2051.80, extending its year-to-date gain to 11%.
That puts the S&P 500 just 2.35% away from 2100, says Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. In pre-market trading Wednesday the S&P 500 was down 2 points, or 0.1%.
But despite these lofty levels, Frederick believes that with the end of the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying program and the congressional midterm elections behind us, the year-end rally on Wall Street has more room to run. He says the 2014 market top is still well ahead of us and the next big round number of 2100 is very possible.
Frederick ticks off a few things working in the stock market’s favor. The lame-duck session of Congress isn’t expected to rile investors, and there’s “no real threat of higher interest rates until at least March or April of 2015,” he says. In addition, the U.S. economy should remain “decoupled” from the problems of Europe and continue to be the “investing location of choice” in the near-term for investors.
If October retail sales figures are an early indication, this will be a very strong holiday shopping season due in part to lower gasoline prices. But Frederick won’t rule out a “small pullback or two” before the end of the year. He says any market dip is a buying opportunity.

Gold rebounds to two-week high on strong demandGold rebounds to two-week high on strong seasonal demand
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 18, 2014  | 20:58 IST
Gold prices rebounded smartly to hit a two-week high at the domestic bullion market on Tuesday due to brisk buying by jewellery stockists and retailers following pick-up in seasonal demand.
Silver continued its firming trend for the third-straight session owing to strong industrial offtake.
Standard gold (99.5 purity) spiked by Rs 165 to finish at Rs 26,540 per 10 grams from its overnight closing level of Rs 26,375.
Pure gold (99.9 purity) also rose by a similar margin to end at Rs 26,690 per 10 grams against Rs 26,525 previously.
Silver (.999 fineness) moved up by Rs 65 to conclude at Rs 37,070 per kg compared to Monday's close of Rs 37,005.
On the global front, the yellow metal climbed above the psychologically significant $1,200 an ounce mark as an improving technical outlook lured investors back to the market amid hectic short-covering.
Spot gold was trading sharply higher at $1,200.05 an ounce in early European trade.

G20 fails to make substantive progress on black moneyG20 fails to make substantive progress on black money
Lalit K Jha     Washington   Last Updated: November 18, 2014  | 11:45 IST

The G-20 summit in Australia failed to make substantial progress on financial transparency and illicit flows, an eminent international think-tank famous for its pioneering work on black money has claimed.
"The G20 passed up a golden opportunity to begin tackling this global scourge by curbing the abuse of anonymous companies and instituting public country-by-country reporting for multinational corporations," said Raymond Baker, president, Global Financial Integrity (GFI).
Considered to be a longtime authority on financial crime, Baker had recently co-authored an open letter to G20 leaders on the topic prior to the summit.
"Illicit financial flows, fuelled by anonymous companies and tax haven secrecy, undercut economic growth and tax revenues, drain roughly $1 trillion per year from developing and emerging countries and facilitate crime and corruption on a grand scale," Baker said.
G20 summit noticeably lacked in responses to illicit financial flows , one of the largest drags on development worldwide, a statement said.
The GFI has long advocated for basic financial transparency measures to hinder common methods of moving illicit money, specifically, public registries of company ownership information, public country-by-country reporting, and global automatic exchange of financial information.
All of these issues have enjoyed a worldwide surge of public momentum in recent years, but the G20's statements this weekend fell short of capitalising on this movement, the statement said.
According to the GFI, the G-20 commitment to automatic exchange of tax information is welcome but incomplete.
"While this is a welcome culmination of the G20's long track record of leadership on automatic exchange, the G20 failed to address the extension of tax information exchange to the other 100+ countries in the world," it said.
"For a couple of years, the G20 has declared that automatic exchange of financial information is 'the new global standard' and now we are proudly seeing that claim come to fruition," said GFI Policy Counsel Joshua Simmons.
"However, it's critical that the new framework for making information exchange a reality is able to accommodate the world's poorest countries, who suffer the effects of tax evasion and money laundering at least as much as and often substantially more than rich countries," he added.

Black Friday Deals May Not Be So HotAre you hoping to sleep in after a big Thanksgiving meal, but worried about  missing out on bargains?
No need.
© Jonathan Alcorn / Reuters / REUTERS
A new study finds that a number of the deals being offered for Black Friday are no better than what was offered last holiday season, or even a week or two earlier.
A study released Tuesday morning by NerdWallet finds that a number of the deals being  offered for Black Friday are no better than what was offered last holiday  season, or even a week or two earlier.
"Retailers keep offering the same kind of deals on Black Friday that  consumers could have gotten for the same price last year," said Matthew Ong,  senior retail analyst for NerdWallet.
The study examined 27 Black Friday advertisements and found that 25 retailers  listed the same products for the same prices as they did in 2013. That's not  necessarily a problem for something like the KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer,  which Kohl's is offering at  $299.99 plus 10 percent off after a $50 rebate, just as in 2013. Mixer design  has not changed much in the past year.
But for technology products, newness matters. Office Depot , for example,  is offering the Brother Digital Color Wireless Printer for $349.97, the same  deal it offered in 2013, even though the technology in the printer is now a year  old.
"Although consumers might expect advances in printer technology to make  older models less expensive, Office Depot will not be selling this printer for  any cheaper this year," the report said.
A spokeswoman for Office Depot said she was unable to confirm  those pricing details and added that "printer technology doesn't change as  quickly as that of a tablet or laptop. Office Depot and OfficeMax strive to  offer our customers the top products from leading manufacturers at an affordable  price."
Video: Nina Willdorf from All You magazine, along with three smart shoppers, shares how to save money on beauty services and why group shopping can help you get items for a lower price.
Great bargains
A number of Black Friday deals are great bargains, Ong said. "But  retailers know door-busters will get people in stores, and they are counting on  shoppers when they are in stores to just grab things and put them in their  carts." 
Sometimes, retailers make Black Friday deals look better by comparing them to  a manufacturer's suggested retail price, even though they normally offer a  discount from that price. NerdWallet found that Sears is offering the  Samsung 55-inch 1080p 120Hz Smart LED HDTV at $599.99, which they compare  with the list price of $1,199.99. But Sears was selling that same  TV for $807.49 shortly before Black Friday, the researchers found.
"Consumers are looking for the big discounts," Ong said, but it is prudent to  check prices on a company's website before the promotions take effect to see if  the discounts are all they seem to be.
Read More The magic that powers  your cybershopping
More women than men seem to have gotten the message about Black Friday.  NerdWallet found 81 percent of men said they typically shop on Thanksgiving  evening or Black Friday, compared with 74 percent of women. And 16 percent of  men expect to spend 10 hours or more waiting in line, shopping in a store, or  shopping online on those days, compared with 10 percent of women.
"Black Friday is really at its core about cheap  electronics," Ong said. Young men are the biggest consumers of electronics, and  "we know a lot of people on Black Friday are buying things for themselves."
Ong recommends consumers start paying attention now to the prices of  items on their holiday shopping lists. Deals may emerge anytime from now until  the end of the holiday shopping season, he said.
Sales were lackluster on the weekend following Thanksgiving 2013, in  part because some shoppers were out snapping up bargains before the holiday.
If the offers NerdWallet found are an indication, shoppers may have no  more motivation than they did last year to hit the stores on this Black Friday.

Where to drink Beaujolais nouveauBy Fritz Hahn November 18 Follow @fritzhahn
The third Thursday of November means it's time for the annual uncorking of Beaujolais nouveau. No one pretends that Beaujolais nouveau is a fine or particularly tasty wine: It's a young and fairly acidic red. But, since French law says that it can't be sold before the third Thursday in November, it's a particularly good reason for a party.

As usual, Bistrot du Coin and 1905 will open the first bottles as Wednesday turns into Thursday. Those who have to work early the next morning won't miss out, though, as there are chances to try the wine on Thursday – even for free – and Friday, when the celebrations move to the French Embassy. You could drink Beaujolais nouveau for three nights straight, if you wanted to, though there's no way the hangover would be worth it.
Wednesday Night
Bistrot du Coin
Bistrot du Coin doesn't change up its Beaujolais Nouveau party much from year-to-year, and that's because it's one of the city's best. As dinner service begins wrapping up around 11 p.m., the waitstaff begins moving tables to turn the Dupont Circle's dining room into a giant dance floor. At midnight, bartenders begin handing out free bottles and glasses of Beaujolais nouveau. DJs spin uptempo house and French songs, often accompanied by live musicians. Stilt walkers dance through the packed bar. It's crowded. It's awesome. With free admission and free wine, lines often stretch down the block. The easiest way to guarantee entry is to make a reservation – even an early one – and hang out at the bar after dinner.
Seventh Annual BYT Beaujolais Party at 1905
D.C.'s hippest annual Beaujolais Nouveau party, hosted by Brightest Young Things, takes over the dimly lit 1905 restaurant from 10 p.m. until last call. DJs spin French music all night – everything from electronic to Serge Gainsbourg – and bartenders serve drink specials from 10 p.m. to midnight. Once the clock hits 12, there's free Beaujolais nouveau for the rest of the night. While the $10 advance tickets sold out quickly, BYT says "a very limited number" of tickets will be available at the door, beginning at 10 p.m.
Thursday
Le Grenier
While the cozy H Street bistro isn't staying open late on Wednesday night, it's giving away free Beaujolais nouveau to all diners on Thursday evening.
Beaujolais Nouveau Art Soiree at Malmaison
Malmaison 's vintage-themed party features DJ Jos spinning modern and old-school French music, videos and projections on the walls, and unlimited wine and charcuterie from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Tickets are $30 in advance .
Beaujolais flights at Slate
No, Beaujolais nouveau isn't usually any good. So Slate owner/sommelier Danny Lledo put together a flight of one 2014 Beaujolais nouveau (Georges Duboeuf) and three different glasses of Beaujolais from 2012 and 2013 to highlight the differences. Lledo will lead the tastings at the Glover Park restaurant from 5 to 8 p.m. A flight costs $15, with no reservations necessary.
Beaujolais Nouveau at the DC Center
The DC LGBT Center 's Center Women group is sponsoring a Beaujolais nouveau tasting at its Reeves Center headquarters. The $15 ticket includes wine and snacks by Patrick Vanas, who was named "Best Caterer" in the Washington Blade's 2014 Best of Gay D.C. poll. A $30 VIP ticket includes a bottle of wine to take home.
Friday
Beaujolais and Beyond at the French Embassy
The fanciest public Beaujolais Nouveau celebration finds the French-American Chamber of Commerce and the Alliance Francaise joining forces for a soiree at the French Embassy . In addition to unlimited wine, the night promises food from Bastille and Ici Urban Bistro; a spread of French breads and cheeses; dancing to a DJ; a blind wine-tasting contest; trivia; a silent auction; and a raffle for two tickets to Paris. Admission to the party, which runs from 8 to 11 p.m., is $65 in advance . A VIP reception, beginning at 7 p.m. and offering special wines, costs $110. Either way, you'll want to dress fashionably.

Spy Museum eyes LEnfant Plaza for new homeBy Jonathan O'Connell November 18 Follow @OConnellPostBiz

Weeks after deciding they needed to shelve a long-planned move to the Carnegie Building, owners of the International Spy Museum have narrowed in on L’Enfant Plaza as a future home.
The Malrite Co., owner of the museum, hasn’t signed a lease yet but is focused on trying to work out a deal there, according to company spokesman Jason Werden.
Chevy Chase-based JBG Cos. owns most of L’Enfant Plaza, where in June it opened a combination of underground restaurants, shops and seating areas after a 20-month, $46 million makeover. Britt A. Snider, principal at JBG, declined to comment.
Werden said the museum is still open to other locations and did not elaborate on where the spy museum would fit in L’Enfant Plaza, but its move there could boost JBG’s efforts to attract more than government employees. About 30,000 people commute to L’Enfant Plaza every weekday but the area remains bereft of the sort of nightlife or tourist attractions that have been rapidly popping up in other parts of the city and region.
JBG has been marketing L’Enfant Plaza as part of a more lively neighborhood, one envisioned as part of a 15-block eco-district by the National Capital Planning Commission. The Wharf, a $2 billion overhaul of the Southwest Waterfront, is under construction a few blocks south. The General Services Administration has proposed developing a federal enclave a few blocks west into a mix that could include offices, housing and hotels.
The spy museum provides flexibility to developers because unlike most retailers or office users, it’s comfortable occupying space underground. In its plans for the Carnegie Building, the museum would have occupied more than 40,000 square-feet in a newly developed underground space, before the plans were turned away by the Historic Preservation Review Board.
JBG owns 955 and 470-490 L’Enfant Plaza and has proposed two other buildings, 500 and 900 L’Enfant Plaza.

How progressive advocates are using the state-by-state approach of the same-sex marriage movement for other issuesBy Hunter Schwarz November 18 Follow @hunterschwarz

(Nati Harnik/AP)
With marriage for same-sex couples now legal for more than half the U.S. population, advocates for other progressive issues are taking the lessons learned by marriage proponents and hoping to apply them to their causes.
“So many other movements are coming to talk to us,” Marc Solomon, the national campaign director for Freedom to Marry, said at a Tuesday event attended by The Washington Post. “I think we learned some things we can share with others.”
Solomon said he’s spoken with advocacy groups that work on environmental issues, sentencing reform, and education reform. On Tuesday, he published an article on The Hill with Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, about what gun control advocates have learned from the marriage movement.
“It’s not like we’re going to take the marriage playbook and apply it to guns,” Solomon said. “It doesn’t work like that.” But the same approach, with a “national campaign with a strong national narrative” and state-level work, could translate well to other issues.
“You had to get a critical mass of states and a critical mass of popular support,” he said. “We had to get the point on the board.”
Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage in 2004, and Solomon and Gross compared that to gun control and Washington state, where a ballot measure requiring background checks for all gun sales was passed by voters earlier this month.
“It was so much about momentum,” Solomon said about marriage for same-sex couples. “You get the first state then you hold the first state. Then we lost the second state, California.”
He said today, opposition to marriage for same-sex couples at the state level is muted, and pointed to Republican gubernatorial candidates in New Mexico, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who didn’t bring the topic up during the campaign.
“They wanted to stay away from the issue,” he said. “Believe me, eight years ago, that would have been a big thing.”

Minor league instructor Tony Beasley named Rangers third base coachBy James Wagner November 18 Follow @jameswagnerwp

Tony Beasley, the former Class AAA Syracuse manager who spent the past year as a Nationals minor league field coordinator , has been hired as the Texas Rangers’ third base coach under new manager Jeff Banister, the team announced on Tuesday afternoon.
Beasley, 47, managed Syracuse from 2012 to 2013 and compiled a 136-152 record. He shifted into the roving field coordinator role last winter and was replaced at Syracuse by Billy Gardner Jr. Beasley has experience as a major league coach; he was the Nationals’ third base coach in 2006 and then the Pittsburgh Pirates’ third base coach from 2008 to 2010.
Beasley, a Virginia native and resident, said the hiring happened quickly and was unexpected. The Rangers called last week for permission, he talked with Banister and, on Monday, he was offered the job. Although he will be further away from his family, he had been looking for a chance to get back on a major league coaching staff and “you never know when those opportunities are going to come.”
“I’m thankful,” he added. “It’s kinda bittersweet. The Nationals have been a tremendous organization to work for. A family bond. Other organizations talk about what they do. I’m very thankful for everything that they’ve given me.”
Beasley, who was well-liked by many of his players, said he gained a deeper appreciation for the Nationals farm system roving around the past year. The quality of the pitching throughout the minor leagues impressed him the most. “We have a tremendous amount of talent in the system, more than I realized because you’re only with your guys,” he said.
Beasley knows Banister from their time together in the Pirates system. Banister played for the Pirates, coached in the system and rose to major league bench coach. Beasley, also a former Pirates minor leaguer, spent most of his time in professional baseball with that organization. Beasley played under Banister, who was a young manager at the time, in 1997 with Class AAA Calgary and the following year at Class AA Carolina as Beasley was a player-coach.
“We have a pretty good relationship,” Beasley said.
James Wagner joined the Post in August 2010 and, prior to covering the Nationals, covered high school sports across the region.

Why Netanyahus use of blood libel is so explosiveBy Ishaan Tharoor November 18 Follow @ishaantharoor
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a press conference in Jerusalem on November 18, 2014. (GIL COHEN MAGEN/AFP/Getty Images)
In the wake of a  deadly attack on worshipers at a Jerusalem synagogue, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu invoked an incredibly loaded term to condemn what he says was Palestinian incitement to violence. The Israeli premier said the latest killings were the result of a "blood libel" against Israeli Jews, a phrase that carries with it the stigma of centuries of anti-Semitic persecution.
The past few weeks have seen an escalation of hostilities  between Israelis and Palestinians living in the holy city. The Islamist militant group Hamas didn't appear to have a direct hand in Tuesday's incident, but applauded the two Palestinian attackers, who wielded knives and guns to kill at least four Israelis at a synagogue in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem.
A Hamas statement praised the action , claiming it was revenge for the recent death of a Palestinian bus driver in the city. Israeli authorities say the man committed suicide, and conducted an autopsy to prove it, but some Palestinians are convinced he was murdered by an Israeli mob.
Netanyahu and some of his political allies jumped on this and used the moment to also condemn Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. "Yesterday, a bus driver in East Jerusalem committed suicide. The autopsy report proves this beyond a doubt," Netanyahu is quoted saying by Haaretz . "This didn't prevent the dissemination of a blood libel that he was murdered by Jews. This incitement contributed to the despicable massacre."
Yoram Cohen, the head of the Shin Bet, Israel's top secret security service, cautioned against Netanyahu's sweeping rhetoric, insisting on Tuesday that Abbas "is not interested in terror and is not inciting to terror."
"Blood libel" is a particularly incendiary phrase. Its roots date back to antiquity, when violence against communities of Jews was justified with false rumors of Jews stealing Christian babies, eating a gentile's entrails, participating in various grisly, sordid blood rituals. There is a long history of this, as I explained in a piece for Time.com a few years ago:
The advent of Christianity forever twinned Jews with blood. In the Gospels, Pontius Pilate publicly washes his hands of the guilt of committing Jesus to death, letting the assembled Jews take on the burden. "His blood be on us and on our children," they declare in Matthew 27: 25. These were words that stuck. Christendom grew rich by encouraging pilgrimages to venerate the purported remains of saints — bones, fingers, ears — but the Jews living in its midst were often openly faulted for bloody, occult practices, all of which were false.
Medieval lore abounds with tales of Jews in towns across Europe, from England to modern-day Slovakia and lands farther east, stealing young Gentile children for blood sacrifices. Invariably, such sensational stories were told to justify mass executions and pogroms of Jewish communities. According to some histories, a 2-year-old named Simon in the Italian town of Trento disappeared in 1475 and was found in the basement of a Jewish family, his body drained of blood so that the Jews could make matzah bread for Passover. Records show that at least eight Jews in the town were subsequently executed; Simon would be canonized as a saint a century later. Fears of Jewish baby snatching were raised by the Spanish Inquisition, leading in part to the expulsion of the entire Jewish community from Spain in 1492.
These tales lingered well into the 19th century and even the 20th century, with anti-Semitism still particularly strong in stretches of Eastern Europe. But some of the first instances of occasions when governments publicly defended Jews from these "blood libels" took place in the Muslim world, with firmans, or edicts, issued as early as the 1400s by a series of Ottoman Sultans, preventing the trial of Jews on such unfounded, outlandish accusations. (Of course, the Middle East wasn't free of anti-Jewish violence. In 1910 the Jewish quarter in the Iranian city of Shiraz was sacked by rioters who were inflamed by fabricated reports that Jews had ritually killed a young Muslim girl.)
The phrase summons a deep, long and traumatic history for Jews, one which Netanyahu thinks is apt to invoke in the context of an already fraught, volatile situation in Jerusalem.
Whether he's justified to do so, it's not the first time Netanyahu has been associated with the term "blood libel." In January 2013, the Sunday Times  published a whole-page cartoon , depicting the Israeli premier building a wall atop the bodies of screaming Palestinians, using mortar that appears to be the color of blood. A caption reads: "Israeli Elections… Will Cementing Peace Continue?"
The cartoon, which was intended to be a critique of Netanyahu's right-wing policies , triggered a furious backlash from Israelis and Jewish organizations overseas. It was unfortunately published on Holocaust Memorial Day, which had escaped the attention of the cartoonist and publication's editor.
"This is the stuff which historically justified hatred of Jews and led to the wholesale slaughter of Jews," a spokesman from the Anti-Defamation League said at the time.
Anshel Pfeffer, a journalist at Haaretz , countered that the cartoon wasn't "anti-Semitic in any way."
"There is absolutely nothing in the cartoon which identifies its subject as a Jew," Pfeffer wrote. "Furthermore, Netanyahu is an Israeli politician who was just elected by a quarter of Israeli voters, not a Jewish symbol or a global representative of the Jews."

Obamacare agency still stingy with enrollment figuresBy Erik Wemple November 18 Follow @ErikWemple
Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell. (Cliff Owen/Associated Press)
During Obamacare’s inaugural enrollment period — spanning the last quarter of 2013 and the first of 2014 — the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) employed a selective approach to releasing key data about activity on HealthCare.gov . In those early, miserable and dysfunctional days of the government’s health-care insurance sign-up portal, “We don’t plan to do hourly or daily data releases but anticipate sharing updates at regular intervals,” an HHS spokeswoman said last fall.  “It will likely be released in the middle of the following month to ensure accuracy. HHS needs to coordinate enrollment from different sources (paper, on-line, call centers), verify with insurers, and collect data from states. We are focused on providing accurate information.”
Once HealthCare.gov started rocking in the early months of 2014, HHS eased up a bit, blasting out releases on key mileposts as they reached them. In February and March, enrollment hit 4 million and 5 million, respectively, and HHS saw no need to wait weeks to tell the public. ( The number stood at 7.1 million as of mid-October )
Funny how, when the numbers are good, HHS can turn them around like *that*. @urbaninstitute As of yesterday, #ACA enrollment hit 5 million
— Christopher Flavelle (@cflav) March 18, 2014
On Saturday, a new and shorter Obamacare enrollment period started up. With a far more smoothly running HealthCare.gov in place, HHS parted with some useful benchmarks. As reported here , for example, 500,000 managed to log on to HealthCare.gov and 100,000 submitted applications on Saturday alone. Now consider October 2013: The government boasted that it had counted 4.7 million unique visitors in the first day alone, a measure of the level of public interest in HealthCare.gov.
Yet it took an investigative effort to pry out the embarrassing, and far more significant, enrollment numbers. On account of Healthcare.gov’s JV technology, very few people were able to use it when it launched, and HHS officials said that enrollment figures wouldn’t even be ready until mid-November 2013. Former CBS News investigative correspondent Sharyl Attkisson writes in her book “ Stonewalled ” that she snared a tip in late October that only six people had enrolled on Healthcare.gov’s first day. After she called HHS to inquire about their numbers, a boomerang dynamic took place: A White House press officer called her producer to complain about the pending story. The official wanted to know what CBS News knew, and the producer protested: “Why would we discuss details of our reporting with them when they insist no enrollment figures exist?” writes Attkisson.
Enrollment numbers remain scarce these days, even with a more functional HealthCare.gov. An HHS source says that “it takes a longer time to aggregate” enrollment figures.
Jeffrey Young, a health-care reporter for the Huffington Post , wonders just how difficult it would be to pry real-time enrollment data from the system. Under the management of Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell — who took over from Kathleen Sebelius in June — HHS has stepped up transparency, including access to the secretary herself, says Young in an e-mail.
As for those 100,000 applications submitted in one day, notes Young, they represent strong interest in the product. That said:
What they didn’t say was how many people got all the way to the end of the process and actually selected an insurance plan. That number is certainly much lower than 100,000. Now, that’s not in itself a problem: people tend to mull these decisions over and return to the site multiple times before enrolling, and there’s still a month before anyone has to choose an insurance policy that will be in place on Jan. 1., and nearly three months until this is all over for the year. But I have to assume that if tens of thousands of people had done so this weekend, they’d tell us, because that would make them look good.
HHS spokesman Kevin Griffis declined to answer that sentiment from Young. Instead, he tells the Erik Wemple Blog that early numbers released to the public reinforce some key messages: “We’re ready: 23K applications submitted in the first eight hours. People are ready to get covered: 1.2 million people who window-shopped in the first week. We’re here to help: 200K+ calls to the call center over the weekend,” notes Griffis in an e-mail.
Since this year’s open enrollment started on Saturday, HHS has provided various figures — generally of the self-serving variety — as reflected in the official Twitter account of HHS Secretary Burwell . For example:
More #GetCovered news from Day 1: As of 10pm last night 100K+ people submitted an app, 500K+ successful log-ins & 100K+ calls to call center
— Sylvia Burwell (@SecBurwell) November 16, 2014
Those disclosures are fine as far as they go. But Bloomberg health-care reporter Alex Wayne suggests that the data release follow a more systematic format:
Massachusetts is issuing daily updates on traffic at its #Obamacare exchange. HealthCare.gov  can’t do this because … umm … hrm.
Here’s the Massachusetts “ Daily Open Enrollment 2015 Dashboard. ” Kentucky, with its celebrated Kynect exchange , released a range of figures from last weekend , including enrollment.
Why can’t the feds act more like these states? We posed that question to HHS and are awaiting an on-the-record answer.
UPDATE 8:30 p.m.: Here’s the response from HHS. “We have put out daily numbers since the start of Open Enrollment to show that the site is ready for people to come back and shop for the coverage that meets their needs, and we will continue to put out information in a timely way. But the measure of the website and the Affordable Care Act isn’t a list of daily Internet numbers, it’s the success we have in reducing the number of uninsured, and by that metric, the law has made a huge difference in millions of lives.”

Postgame: Four killed penalties helped Caps surviveBy Alex Prewitt November 19 Follow @alex_prewitt

GLENDALE, Ariz. – Seventeen days ago, across the country at Verizon Center, the Washington Capitals squandered a two-goal lead against the Arizona Coyotes and subsequently reached their nadir . They were criticized by their head coach for poor behavior. They called a closed-door meeting to hash out the issues. They committed nine penalties and twice allowed their visitors to score on the power play.
“We got torched last game against the Coyotes,” Coach Barry Trotz said, and goaltender Braden Holtby offered even more candor.
“Honestly the last Arizona game was probably our worst game on the [penalty kill],” he said, “just because we weren’t quite in sync.”
In the time since, the Capitals tweaked their penalty kill under the guidance of assistant coach Lane Lambert, calling for more aggression from the forwards. Over the last six games, only one NHL team – the Florida Panthers – had allowed fewer shorthanded shots per 60 minutes than Washington, according to War On Ice. The unit felt rejuvenated, no more so than during Tuesday night’s pivotal second period against, in a fitting twist of redemption, the Coyotes.
Over the middle 20 minutes in a 2-1 overtime win , the Capitals killed off 1 minute, 31 seconds of an abridged Arizona power play for Mike Green’s hooking, two full minutes of Alex Ovechkin’s charging, 1:32 of Nicklas Backstrom’s slashing – cut short thanks to an embellishment call on Martin Erat – and finally two minutes of John Carlson’s interference. Eight players skated at least 2 shorthanded minutes, a team effort in squelching the Coyotes.
“The PKers have done a really good job of solidifying some stuff,” Trotz said. “You’ve got to get the saves when you’re PKing and today we did. Braden made a couple good stops when we had those back-to-back-to-back penalties. Really zapped our bench there when first six minutes of the period you’re shorthanded.”
That the Capitals emerged from the second period tied, and not behind several goals, boosted their energy entering the final period, when they maintained possession in Arizona’s defensive zone and kept the momentum going into overtime, setting up forward Eric Fehr’s eventual winner.
“It’s a huge boost,” forward Jay Beagle said. “It’s a boost of confidence. Some guys get a little bit of rest who aren’t PKing too, so they’re ready to go. In the third, I thought we had that jump again to push the pace back, play in their end, take it to them. To weather the storm like that was obviously huge for us.”
Said Trotz: “It was 1-1, but it could’ve been 3-1 if we don’t get through that period.”
Having a dialed-in Holtby, who made 23 saves and allowed two or fewer goals for the fourth straight game, also helped. The only goal he allowed came shortly after Green left the penalty box, when Sam Gagner whipped a behind-the-back pass to Oliver Ekman-Larsson. Otherwise, Holtby made seven penalty kill saves.
“It’s the same thing as guys on the power play,” he said. “That’s your job. That’s where your contribute, and that’s the mindset I take to elevate my game in those situations or try to. Tonight it worked out.”

Fitch rates NTPC s proposed $2-bn notes secureFitch rates NTPC's proposed $2-bn notes secure
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 19, 2014  | 14:12 IST
Fitch Ratings has assigned BBB-rating to state-run NTPC 's proposed $2 billion medium-term note programme.
The ratings of BBB-are considered secure by Fitch.
"The notes will constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of NTPC. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received," Fitch said in a statement.
Fitch assesses the linkages between NTPC and the sovereign are moderate, with strategic linkages being especially strong.
NTPC's ratings benefit from stable operational cash flows due to the favourable regulatory framework. The company has long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for all its plants that allow for the pass-through of fixed costs as well as fuel costs, the statement said.
Its returns are regulated based on invested capital and a rate of return as per a transparent regulatory model.
"There are no off-take risks as the fixed costs are payable if the plant has achieved the regulatory benchmark availability. There is regulatory certainty until March 2019, the latest five year regulatory tariff period," it said.

FIIs hike stake in Infosys to 42.67% in Jul-Sep quarterEmerging as one of the most-liked stocks for foreign funds, Infosys has seen overseas investors raising their stake in the company to a nine and half-year high of nearly 42.67 per cent during the quarter ended September 2014.
However, the exact date of share purchased by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) could not be ascertained.
Infosys new chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director Vishal Sikka took charge of the company in August.
Cumulative FII holdings in the company rose to 42.67 per cent in the July-September quarter this year from 39.93 per cent in three months ended September last year, according to data from stock exchanges.
This is the highest level of FII holding in the country’s second largest software services firm since March 2005, when their stake in Infosys stood at 42.87 per cent.
In the April-June quarter of 2014, FIIs’ holding in Infosys stood at 41.58 per cent.
The rise in overseas shareholding of Infosys coincides with overall bullishness shown by foreign entities in the Indian stock market.
During the July-September quarter, Infosys shares surged by more than 14 per cent, as against 4.78 per cent gain in BSE’s benchmark Sensex.
In the same period, FIIs invested a staggering sum of over Rs 23,000 crore in the Indian equities on the back of ongoing reform initiatives taken by the Centre.
Mr. Sikka, the first outsider as well as not part of the co-founder’s club to lead the Bangalore-based firm, was the head of technology and innovation department at German software giant SAP.
Infosys mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy stepped down in June, four years before his tenure was to end. He was brought back to head the IT major in June last year, following quarters of laggard performance.
Besides, the overall holding of institutional investors also rose to 57.15 per cent during July-September period of this year from 55.56 per cent at the end of June 30, 2014, mostly on account of additional share purchases by FIIs.
The domestic institutional holdings in the company stood at 14.48 per cent as on September 30, 2014, up from 14.08 per cent in April-June quarter of 2014.

Mizoram CM names and shames 25 gazetted officers with corruption casesCM Lal Thanhawla replied 25 gazetted officers face such cases, and proceeded to read out the list. (Source: PTI photo)
Written by Adam Halliday | Aizawl | Posted: November 19, 2014 6:43 pm | Updated: November 20, 2014 2:07 am
Mizoram Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla on Wednesday read out before the state assembly the names, designation and charges against 25 gazetted officers in Mizoram — including an Additional Inspector General of Police, a Director and Deputy Director of major departments and senior government engineers including a Chief Engineer — who are currently being investigated by the vigilance department on various corruption charges.
The Congress veteran, who since returning to power in 2008 after a decade has repeatedly said that his government is dedicated to fighting corruption, was replying to a question by Mizo National Front MLA Lalrinawma, who asked how many gazetted officers currently have vigilance cases pending against them.
Lal Thanhawla replied 25 gazetted officers face such cases, and proceeded to read out the list.
Among those on it are suspended PWD Chief Engineer (Highways) Vanlalduhsaka, who is charged with awarding 13.75 percent extra to contractors SLT Infracon and who was also investigated for lapses that allegedly led to a massive landslide in Aizawl that killed 17 people last year.
Three of Vanlalduhsaka’s PWD colleagues are also being investigated by the vigilance department — among them Assistant Engineer Lalramzauva for allegedly taking money from contractors in connection with the building of a polytechnic at eastern Champhai town, and Executive Engineer R Zatawna for allegedly mis-appropriating Rs 6.75 lakhs of government money.
Another senior officer under investigation is AIG-III Thomas Zodingliana, a Mizoram Police Service (MPS) service cadre, for “deployment of police personnel for his private works.”
Former Agriculture Director H Lalthanpuia is also under investigation for drawing “fraudulent bills amounting to Rs 14.34 lakhs”, while Deputy Director of Horticulture H Lalchhuanvawra and another officer of the same department, Lalrinawmi Renthlei, are being probed for mis-appropriating funds meant for grape cultivation at Hnahlan, the main hub of Mizoram’s indigenous wine industry.
Other officials under investigation include a headmaster of a government-owned Higher Secondary School, a Medical Officer, a handful of Block Development Officers, and a host of other officials with various other departments.
After Lal Thanhawla read out the names Lalrinawma, the opposition MLA who asked the question, commented, “Thank you. I got a reply much more detailed than I expected.”

Surat doctor arrested for allegedly carrying out sex determinationtestsPrint
By: Express News Service | Surat | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:31 pm
Surat police arrested a doctor for allegedly being involved in carrying out sex determination tests at her clinic in Varachha area Wednesday, following a sting operation carried out by Surat health department with the police.
The Surat district health department officials had few days ago got a tip off about Dr. Gita Mangukia, who runs Riddhi Siddhi clinic at Shivam Park society in Kapodara area in Surat, being involved in sex determination test and even female foeticide. The health department sent a decoy to the clinic on November 16. Dr. Gita Mangukia examined the patient and also disclosed the sex of the child and charged Rs 7,000 from her.
After getting a signal from the patient, Health officer Dr. Megha Mehta along with her team and police department staff raided Riddhi Siddhi clinic in Kapodara. Seeing the health officials and police staff, Mangukia, escaped from the rear door and went underground. The health officials had also seized sonography machines from her clinic.
Acting on a tip off, Kapodara police officials arrested Dr. Gita Mangukia, from her house at Shivkrupa Society, Chikuwadi, Kapodara, on Wednesday afternoon and booked her under various sections of Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act of 1994.
Surat district health department officer Dr. Megha Mehta said, “We have not questioned her as she had been arrested today. Dr. Gita Mangukia is holding BAMS degree and she had installed Sonography machine used in sex determination test. We have seized many documents from her clinic and they are under verification to find out till today how many test she had carried out. We also suspect her involvement in carrying out female feoticide. After her interrogation we will get more information from her.”

China blocks websites as Internet meetingbeginsWebsites.
By: Associated Press | Beijing | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:18 pm
Chinese censors have newly blocked access to several popular websites as they target content delivery networks that serve much of the Internet, according to a U.S. Internet service company.
The action comes as China hosts the World Internet Conference, which brings together many of the world’s top technology companies.
EdgeCast, an affiliate of Verizon, says censors have taken down several networks that provide local servers to help speed website performance. EdgeCast provides such a network, and its clients include software company Mozilla, publishing company The Atlantic and content management system Drupal.
The online activist group Greatfire.org said Wednesday that it was the target of the Chinese action, which blocked many other sites that use EdgeCast. The group enables Chinese Internet users to access websites otherwise blocked by Chinese censors. EdgeCast did not confirm Greatfire.org’s statement.
A Greatfire.org co-founder, who goes by the pseudonym Charlie Smith, said they had chosen to use several content delivery networks knowing that any move to take down their site would affect others.
“We knew that ahead of time,” he said. “It was our feeling that the authorities would not take that kind of action.”
China employs thousands of censors who block hundreds of websites and erase social media messages dealing with sensitive political topics. At the same time, it claims some of the world’s most popular online sites, including e-commerce giant Alibaba.
Alibaba founder Jack Ma told the Internet conference Wednesday that China’s online strength is bound to transform the Web. Outside the conference hall, several protesters were detained after holding up a banner demanding that China allow access to sites such as Google, Facebook and Twitter.
“I believe China’s Internet is not only profoundly influencing aspects of China’s economic development but is also participating in the development of the Internet across the world,” Ma told the conference.

Vijay Hazare Trophy: Wasim Jaffer sends Mumbai through to quarters  DelhihomeBy: Press Trust of India | Rajkot | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:15 pm
Veteran batsman Wasim Jaffer played a perfect innings in a modest chase as Mumbai outclassed Delhi by six wickets to enter quarter-final of the National One Day Championship for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.
Mumbai will meet defending champions Karnataka in the quarter-finals.
Mumbai captain Suryakumar Yadav won a good toss and his bowlers responded brilliantly, bowling out Delhi for 157 in 42.3 overs. Virender Sehwag (9) and Gautam Gambhir (22) ‘s saga of failures continued as Delhi never looked like being in the match.
In reply, Mumbai maintained a steady tempo without taking undue risks, courtesy Jaffer as he struck an unbeaten 83 off 87 balls to take his team to victory in 30.3 overs. His customary on-drives were a treat to watch as all the bowlers including the seasoned Ashish Nehra were guilty of bowling on his pads.
Jaffer’s innings had 11 boundaries and a six and his sequence of scores in the tournament now read: 83, 37, 84, 60 and 83 no.
“Whatever remaining years I have in first-class cricket, I would like to continue scoring runs. After having played Test cricket, it is important to have the motivation to continue doing well in first class. I still have the motivation to perform for Mumbai,” a pragmatic Jaffer said at the end of the match.
The 9am start did help the Mumbai bowlers as there was a bit of assistance from the pitch, complemented by good bounce.
Unmukt Chand (6) tried to glance Shardul Thakur and was caught down the leg side by Aditya Tare — a decision that didn’t make the batsman happy. Unmukt has failed to total 50 after six matches.
Sehwag (9) did hit a couple of boundaries off pacers. An on-drive and a pull had Sehwag signature all over it but Thakur squared up the legend with one that moved a shade and took an outside edge straight into Surya’s hands in the slips.
Gambhir (22) hit a few boundaries before he perished due to age-old technical malaise of trying the dab shot down third-man off Wilkin Mota only to find Tare taking an outstanding diving catch.
Milind Kumar (64 off 94 balls) was the highest scorer but he consumed far too many balls and the number of dot balls that he played only increased the pressure. Rajat Bhatia (12) was run-out while Puneet Bisht (12) played an irresponsible aerial sweep shot off Akhil Herwadkar.
In the end, 158 wasn’t a big target and Mumbai cruised to the target with ease.
Brief Scores: Delhi 157 in 42.3 overs (Milind Kumar 64, Shardul Tahkur 3/25) Mumbai 158/4 (Wasim Jaffer 83 no, Akhil Herwadkar 30) Mumbai win by 6 wkts.
Quarter-final: Karnataka vs Mumbai.
Harbhajan leads Punjab to quarters
Captain Harbhajan Singh led from the front with an all-round effort as Punjab coasted to a comfortable 29-run win against Gujarat in the pre-quarterfinals of the Vijay Hazare one-day tournament.
Punjab will meet Railways in the quarter-finals. Put into bat at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground, Punjab rode fine fifties from Amitoze Singh (75), Gurkeerat Singh Mann (72) continued…

Vivek Agnihotri, director of "Buddha in a Traffic Jam".

Vivek Agnihotri’s upcoming venture, “Buddha in a Traffic Jam”, seeks to tackle a bold subject
Bollywood’s new-age filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri doesn’t believe in half measures. Whether the genre is a political drama, thriller or erotica, Vivek sees to it that he does methodical research into his subject. He even goes the extra yard before coming up with an appropriate title of his upcoming movie.
This probably explains his title of his upcoming venture Buddha in a Traffic Jam, which suggests that an enlightened, talented and a man of ideas can be stuck in a quagmire. The film is complete and the filmmaker is screening it at various film festivals before releasing it in theatres.
“Buddha epitomised enlightenment and I deliberately used his name in my upcoming film with the intent of conveying the message that a man who is full of intelligent ideas can find himself helpless because the system does not give him leeway to implement his ideas,” he says, referring to bureaucrats who put roadblocks on the work of those who seek to do something for the humanity.
Illustrating his own struggle to carve out a niche for himself in the entertainment industry, Vivek – credited with films like Chocolate and Hate Story – says initially he was welcomed but after the first release things became difficult for him.
“When I entered the film industry, I faced no problem. But after the first release, insecure filmmakers tried to put impediments in my path. People are content with mediocrity. In Bollywood either we have no-brainers or masala movies, which produce mindless cinema. Why everyone has to leave his brain behind to enjoy a film? Just because you (filmmakers) are dumb doesn’t mean that cinemagoers are also.”
Describing his latest labour of love as a political commentary, Vivek says he has depicted the confrontation between capitalism and socialism, socialist ideas and those who want an end to red-tapism so that they can improve either their prospects or those around them.
“The film is about those aspects which we come across in our daily lives. The youth is increasingly getting frustrated because of rigidity of the system. Corruption has increased to such an extent but everyone is comfortable with it. It is all about mindset, intellectual terrorism and intellect of those who have destroyed our society.”
The film is set in Hyderabad and this time the filmmaker says the location hasn’t got anything to do with the subject. Probably one has to watch the flick to get the larger picture. “I could not choose Delhi and Mumbai as locations because both cities have lost their credibility. Hyderabad has become the business capital. It is known for producing technologists and entrepreneurs. So this location was justified for showing the battle between capitalism and socialism.”
His choice of Buddha is Arunoday Singh, a face familiar in contemporary films. He made his wife Pallavi Joshi play better half to senior actor Anupam Kher to break stereotypes of showing age gap between husband and wife. “Why cannot a 60-year-old man have a young wife?” he argues.

Tammy Duckworth's request to cast a proxy vote in the Democratic leadership elections. Duckworth was advised by her doctor not to fly to Washington in her eighth month of pregnancy. Duckworth (D-Ill.) also is a double-amputee Iraq War veteran, or, as Stewart put it, a Democratic demographic Turduckworth. The reason for denying the proxy vote? Pelosi said it would set a precedent ... and Duckworth happened to be supporting someone other than Pelosi's chosen candidate for a committee position.
Earlier in the show, while talking about Jonathan Gruber and the Affordable Care Act, he said of Pelosi: "Can you ever not not disappoint us?"

Morning Plum: Conservative legal group says action on deportations is legalBy Greg Sargent November 19 Follow @theplumlinegs
With Republicans set to wage an epic showdown against President Obama’s expected executive action to shield millions from deportation — an action they claim will unleash Constitutional Armageddon — even members of one of the most influential conservative legal organizations in the country are now acknowledging his action is legal.
Sam Stein reports that senior lawyers at the annual convention of the Federalist Society entered into a spirited discussion in which panelists effectively acknowledged the President’s authority to act in this arena:
“I think the roots of prosecutorial discretion are extremely deep,” said Christopher Schroeder, the Charles S. Murphy Professor of Law and Public Policy Studies at Duke Law School. “The practice is long and robust. The case law is robust. Let me put it this way: Suppose some president came to me and asked me in the office of legal counsel, ‘Is it okay for me to go ahead an defer the deportation proceedings of childhood arrival?’ Under the present state of the law, I think that would be an easy opinion to write. Yes.”
Schroeder was speaking specifically about the deferred action program that Obama already has put into place — the one affecting so-called Dreamers who were brought to the U.S. as children. But later, Schroeder expanded his legal reasoning.
“I don’t know where in the Constitution there is a rule that if the president’s enactment affects too many people, he’s violating the Constitution,” Schroeder said. “There is a difference between executing the law and making the law. But in the world in which we operate, that distinction is a lot more problematic than you would think. If the Congress has enacted a statute that grants discretionary authority for the administrative agency or the president to fill in the gaps, to write the regulations that actually make the statute operative, those regulations to all intents and purposes make the law.”
Schroeder is not a conservative, but Stein reports that other panelists “by and large” agreed with his points. And the notion that the large number of people affected by this action doesn’t necessarily make it illegal is important. As I noted yesterday , while Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and Obama’s coming proposal, are rooted in law and precedent, they do go further than pretty much anything attempted before in scope and scale. Critics will rely heavily on this to further the impression that this just feels like we’re crossing into lawlessness. But that doesn’t make it true, as the above law professor notes.  And on this point, he’s in agreement with many liberal legal experts .
The idea that Congress created the statute that left the president with the authority to exercise broad enforcement discretion is also key. And at the Federalist Society convention, another legal scholar, one who agreed with Schroeder but also accused Obama of “destabilizing the republic,” added: “If Congress wants to restrain the discretion of the president, they are supposed to do what the separation of powers encourages them to do: Write the statute tightly so that it will be actually administered the way you want it administered.”
Translation: Congress effectively gave the president the authority to do what he is about to do; if Congress wants, it can move to take that authority away.
And indeed, this is exactly what Congress very well may attempt. When Republicans take control in January, they will likely try to pass measures rolling back Obama’s authority to shield large classes from deportation. That’s what they should do. The rub, though, is that many conservatives will demand they go farther, by staging government funding fights to roll back Obama’s actions that could result in a government shutdown.
GOP leaders reportedly don’t want to go this far. But, even if some right-leaning legal scholars understand that this latest move is legal, GOP base voters have been told by their leaders for years that Obama is hell bent on shredding the Constitution. In some areas, Obama certainly has overreached in ways that history should judge harshly. But GOP rhetoric on this topic has been way over the top and even Apocalyptic in the face of all sorts of Obama initiatives. If base voters think GOP leaders should mount maximum resistance to what they are describing as his latest act of supreme lawlessness, who’s to blame them? The result is that even if GOP leaders want to avoid government funding fights, they may not have any choice.
**********************************************************
UPDATE: I should have clarified that Christopher Schroeder, who supplied the remarks I block-quoted above, is not a conservative. But other members of the Federalist Society panel agreed with him. The second lawyer I quoted on the fact that Congress should clarify Obama’s authority if it doesn’t like this action, who also agreed with Schroeder, also accused Obama of “destabilizing the republic.”
Also, Stein did note that these lawyers weren’t necessarily speaking for the Federalist Society. But as Stein reported: “by and large, the panelists agreed the president has wide legal latitude to prioritize and shape deportation laws.”
I’ve edited the above to clarify these points.
**************************************************************
* EXPERTS: OBAMA’S EXECUTIVE ACTION IS LEGAL: Law professors Erwin Chemerinsky and Sam Kleiner have a good piece running through the legal basis for executive action to defer the deportation of large classes of people and the history of such actions by previous presidents .
One key nugget: This has historically been applied for humanitarian reasons, which may be the justification for Obama’s action deferring the deportation of parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents: To prevent the breakup of families.
* MAP OF THE DAY: Related to the above: Aaron Blake brings us a map that shows that many, many states are home to children in high school and younger who have at least one parent who is an undocumented immigrant . The precise impact Obama’s action on all of these people is unknown, but as Blake notes, this shows that a whole lot of children have a stake in that action; it’s not only about illegal immigrants.
* WHITE HOUSE LOWERS EXPECTATIONS: The Hill reports that administration officials are privately letting immigration advocates know that Obama’s executive action may not shield as many people from deportation as they had hoped.  This raises two questions: First, how will Obama justify extending deportation relief to the parents of legal children but not to the parents of DREAMers?
Second, will advocates disappointed by the scope of his action nonetheless rally behind him for the brutal political fight to come?
* KEYSTONE VOTE SHOWS SPLIT AMONG DEMS: In a victory for the environmental movement, Senate Democrats blocked the Keystone pipeline last night, after Mary Landrieu failed to secure enough Dems to pass it for the good of her reelection chances . The Times observes:
Tuesday’s vote exposed to public view some of the contours and rifts in the Democratic Party, where many senators feel they have too often bent over backward to accommodate Ms. Landrieu…They finally revolted, in what they said was a vote of principle against legislation they believe would harm the environment. Throughout her Senate career, Ms. Landrieu, a moderate who was known as the oil industry’s best friend in the Democratic Party, has clashed with the liberal environmental wing of her party.
Fourteen Dems voted for Keystone, but all others opposed it. The environment and climate change are increasingly a priority for the Democratic Party overall, and as such could matter politically in 2016, but divisions clearly remain.
* REPUBLICANS USED TO WANT TO SOLVE IMMIGRATION: The Dem-aligned Americans United for Change has released a new Web video contrasting John Boehner’s 2013 claims that he really, truly wants to address our immigration crisis with his current vow to fight “tooth and nail” against anything Obama does unilaterally to accomplish that. With a major fight looming, a key component of the Dem message will be that Republicans simply refuse to solve a problem they themselves have said must be solved.
* GOP BLOCKS REFORM OF NSA BULK SURVEILLANCE: Last night Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic bill to end bulk surveillance by the National Security Agency and reform spying practices more generally:
Just four Republicans joined Democrats to advance the bill: Ted Cruz of Texas, Dean Heller of Nevada, Mike Lee of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Bill Nelson of Florida was the only Democrat to vote against cloture…Rand Paul, voted against the bill because it didn’t go far enough in his opinion to roll back surveillance under the Patriot Act.
So much for the rise of libertarianism in the GOP…
* GOP STILL FACES BIG GENDER GAP: Scott Bland has a fascinating look at what really happened in the last election, by the numbers . One notable event was the epic collapse of Democrats in the south. There’s also this:
Republicans won male voters 57 percent to 41 percent in the 2014 elections, a whopping 16-point margin, according to the exit polls . That’s slightly better than the GOP did among men even during the 2010 wave election. But Democrats also improved among female voters compared with four years ago, carrying women by a 4-point margin, 51 percent to 47 percent. That 20-point gender gap between men’s support for Republicans and women’s support for Democrats is the largest recorded in the national House exit poll in two decades.
It’s true that the Democrats’ “war on women” strategy fell short in key races. But the broader continuing advantage Democrats have among women is also important and could have major ramifications going forward into 2016.

How to harness all of our countrys tech talentBy Matt McFarland November 19 Follow @mattmcfarland

U.S. chief technology officer Megan Smith spoke Tuesday night in Washington, D.C. about how to get more young women interested in engineering and technology. The event was hosted by USAID and Intel, which released a related report . Here are a few highlights from Smith’s conversation with Melanne Verveer, executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security:
I think it’s so important in preschool and in kindergarten and elementary school that we’re not biasing ourselves. It’s so interesting that when somebody’s pregnant we are obsessed with knowing the gender of the child so we can figure out what we need to buy that child, what the present would be. Like we’re pre-programming the kid before they were born. So thinking through how to make sure we’re bringing incredible toys and experiences and that to our girls and our boys at some point is really important for this country for the world in general.
Smith touched on our culture’s tendency to envision men as software engineers, but not women:
When the PC era came we bought the PC and gave it to our boys. I know of some colleagues who the computer [were] locked in their brother’s room and they had to get a key to go get it. And now they’re computer scientists too.
My friend Anna Patterson , a colleague when I was at Google, her brother was in the space program and one time she and her brother were together. She’s an incredible search engineer, one of the VPs at Google. The astronauts were talking to her and her brother and said to her brother “Hey what do you want to be when you grow up?” He said “I want to be an astronaut,” and they’re like “Yeh!”  And they said to Anna, “What do you want to be?” and she said “an astronaut,” and they said “Girls aren’t astronauts.” … We just had this cultural perspective of the boys and computers in the 80s and 90s timeframe and it just skewed things.
Smith was asked by Verveer how best to go forward:
Flipping our classrooms into active learning spaces really is important and having these convenient spaces where people feel comfortable. I think one of the things that happened was because for awhile in schools you never teach somebody to read and not teach them to write, but we’re really happy to teach you all these facts from science and all this stuff but not have you have lab or art class or home ec or shop or gym and do and make things as part of your sort of written expression. We need to really make that true. … A little kid doesn’t start writing a fabulous essay or an amazing book from day one. You start with little baby steps.

Indias coming boom  explained.By Vivek Wadhwa November 19 Follow @wadhwa
When I started researching India’s engineering education in 2005, my first conclusion was that Indian I.T. was doomed. The country was barely graduating enough engineers to staff this growing industry. The quality of engineers that India’s universities graduated was also inconsistent, and most were unemployable. To make matters worse, India graduated hardly any engineering PhDs—so there wasn’t much hope of improving the education system. I concluded that Indian innovation would never get off the ground.
Yet, during my trip to Mumbai this month, in a talk I gave at  INK India (a spicy version of TED), I predicted that in less than a decade there will tens of thousands of start-ups building health sensors, robots, drones, commerce, and infrastructure tools; hundreds of thousands of app builders solving local problems; and millions of Internet entrepreneurs. I’d come to conclude that India is about to experience an entrepreneurship boom that will make America’s dot-com boom seem lame. It is entrepreneurs who will be solving not only India’s problems but those of the world.
What changed after 2005? How did innovation in India begin to bloom, and how did Indian engineers achieve such success? Watch my INK talk above to learn the answer .

The algorithm that protects grandmaBy Matt McFarland November 19 Follow @mattmcfarland
Technology is making it easier for us to monitor our loved ones. (Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)
Imagine getting this e-mail: “Grandma walked 41 percent less this week than she did the last three weeks. You might want to check and see if something is wrong with her.”
It might sound a bit precise for a message sent from your sibling or grandmother’s caregiver. Forty one percent? Sure, it’s helpful to know. I know I’d be calling my grandmother to check in on her. But how could someone find the time to calculate that? It sounds almost robotic, and well, it is.
GreatCall , which offers devices that keep the elderly in touch with their caregivers, has partnered with an artificial intelligence company to send automated reports to concerned children and grandchildren. The idea is to empower the elderly to live more safely on their own, while easing the worries of caregivers.
Automated Insights , which specializes in turning mountains of data into plain English, will be providing weekly recaps to caregivers, so they have a better idea of how their loved one is doing. While a grandparent might at times be reluctant to share bad news, the device and automated emails never mince words. Automated Insights’ algorithm is currently used for generating everything from snarky  fantasy football recaps to write-ups on Edmunds.com.
Here’s one sample of an update a caregiver might receive:
Chris actively used his 5Star for six days last week and could contact help if needed during that time. He spent time at the farmer’s market, his daughter’s home and the coffee shop. He did a great job of charging the device regularly, never letting the battery power fall to a low level.
With its 5Star devices, GreatCall can use GPS to pinpoint a user’s location. A caregiver could input common locations, such as a doctor’s office, grocery store or friend’s house, to be better aware of if the elderly person is getting out regularly. It would be possible to track whether a loved one made it to their doctor’s appointments, or hadn’t been food-shopping in a few weeks.
In theory, for a senior citizen willing to sacrifice some privacy about their comings and goings, they’d be able to be more independent and live alone longer than caregivers might otherwise be comfortable with.
GreatCall offers a simplified smartphone and flip phone that are designed to appeal to older users. There’s also the Splash, a simple monitor that can even be worn in the shower. It has only one external button, so users can contact medical help.
“There’s this common misperception that everyone is walking around with iPhones or [Samsung] Galaxies,” GreatCall chief executive David Inns said. “When you look at the portion of the older population that actually is the most vulnerable and has the highest health care costs and are the ones who actually needs services to keep them connected and safe with health solutions, they’re exactly the ones who aren’t adopting smartphone technology quickly.”
Between wearable technologies, sensors and the Internet, there’s room for even more opportunity in the space. Accelerometers, which are present in smartphones, could likely detect if a user had fallen. While now GreatCall and Automated Insights provide information on if a device is being used, and where it’s being taken, there are plans to do more.
“We’re able to show some of the promise of what is going to be possible in the future as we get access to data that’s available on other devices, sensors or things of that nature,” Automated Insights chief executive Robbie Allen said of the partnership. “We’re able to tell a story about data in a way that’s engaging and provides a layer of value on top of that data.”

Boehner finally found someone to sue Obama. And hes a liberal.By Jason Millman November 19 Follow @jasonmillman
What's a self-professed liberal doing suing the Obama administration, anyway?
That's the first question that comes to mind after the announcement that House Republicans hired George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley to lead their lawsuit challenging President Obama's executive actions on the health-care law. Turley, who said he voted for Obama in 2008 and supports national health care, is now the third lawyer that Speaker John Boehner has hired on this lawsuit since it was announced this summer.
Turley's hiring has drawn some quick derision from the left. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi during a press conference on Tuesday referred to Turley as a "TV lawyer," a dig on his frequent appearances on cable news networks and a suggestion that taking on this lawsuit may be more about publicity than anything.
The House lawsuit was first announced over the summer, as a reaction to the administration's decision to delay enforcement of an Obamacare provision that would require businesses with at least 50 employees to offer health insurance. Democrats say the lawsuit is politically motivated and without merit.
For his part, Turley says that he's been alarmed by what he sees as a creeping power grab by the executive branch, regardless of which party is in the White House. "Our constitutional system as a whole (as well as our political system) would benefit greatly by courts reinforcing the lines of separation between the respective branches," Turley wrote on his blog Monday night, explaining his decision to represent the House GOP.
Turley writes that his suit "has more to do with constitutional law than health care law." And he sides with Obamacare critics on another lawsuit that could undermine the law.
The Supreme Court will next year decide whether the Affordable Care Act allows states with federal-run marketplaces, or exchanges, to access insurance subsidies. Critics say the law explicitly only allows subsidies through exchanges established by the state. The Obama administration and supporters say even if the law's language is murky on this point, an entire reading of the law and congressional history indicate any exchange — regardless of who's running it — can provide subsidies.
Turley says it's clear that Congress prevented subsidies in federal-run exchanges as a way to incentivize states to establish their own. And that the IRS rule declaring otherwise, after most states refused to set up their own, amounts to an executive power grab, he said.
“My support for national health care is immaterial to the merits of the litigation in the Halbig and King cases. Those cases are less about health care than they are legisprudence — the study and interpretation of legislation,” Turley said in an email.
"The absence of the subsidies could present an existential threat for the [ACA] as a whole by allowing millions to be exempted from the program," he continued. "That does not necessarily mean that collapse of the ACA. It means that the solution must be found in new legislation by Congress as opposed to new statutory construction by the courts."
Unlike the past two House lawyers, it seems like Turley will actually stick around for this lawsuit — after all, he's been publicly supporting the lawsuit for months. The bigger question is whether there's a case to make in the first place.
Jason Millman covers all things health policy, with a focus on Obamacare implementation. He previously covered health policy for Politico.

Big Booty Going Mainstream Is Big Boon For BusinessesBig Booty Going Mainstream Is Big Boon For Businesses
 | By                                                                JOSEPH PISANI

NEW YORK (AP) — Gym classes that promise a plump posterior are in high demand. A surgery that pumps fat into the buttocks is gaining popularity. And padded panties that give the appearance of a rounder rump are selling out.
The U.S. booty business is getting a big bump. Companies are cashing in on growing demand from women seeking the more curvaceous figures of their favorite stars, who flaunt their fuller rear ends.
Nicki Minaj, for instance, raps about her "big fat" butt in "Anaconda." Reality star Kim Kardashian posts photos of hers on Instagram. And in the music video for "Booty," Jennifer Lopez and Iggy Azalea, wearing leotards, spend four minutes rubbing their curvy bottoms together. At one point, they slap each other on the booty.
As a result of the pop culture moment the butt is having, sales for Booty Pop, which hawks $22 foam padded panties on its website, are up 47 percent in the last six months from the same period a year earlier. The company, which declined to give sales figures, has sold out of certain styles and colors this year, including its Pink Cotton Candy Boy Shorts.
Susan Bloomstone, Booty Pop's co-founder, says customers have asked for larger sizes. So, the Boston-based company plans to begin selling pads that are 25 percent larger this month. "People just want more booty," she says.
Feel Foxy, another maker of padded panties, says 2014 has been its best year since launching nearly a decade ago. Sales are up 40 percent from a year ago, but the company declined to give sales figures.
"The Nicki Minaj song gave women the idea to pay attention to their rear end," says Jessica Asmar, co-owner of the Houston company.
Deborah Santiago squeezed into a $40 Feel Foxy one-piece for her 30th birthday. The shapewear flattened Santiago's waist and boosted her back side. A flat butt can ruin an outfit, says the New York stay-at-home mother of two. Lopez is her butt idol, but she also covets the bottoms of reality TV stars on "The Real Housewives of Atlanta" and "Love & Hip Hop."
"I always wanted a big butt," Santiago says. "Something you could look twice at."
To be sure, the desire for big butts isn't new. Large booties long have been preferable in Latino and black communities, says Dr. Dionne Stephens, an associate psychology professor at Florida International University who has researched sexuality in popular culture. And this is not the first time big butts have been in songs. (Think: "Baby Got Back" by Sir Mix-A-Lot in the 1990s.)
But recently, the desire for a bigger bottom became more mainstream, in large part due to pop culture influences. Mainstream celebrities like Lopez and Minaj accepting their ample assets on camera have given the butt cachet. "When people see things repeated on TV more and more, it becomes normalized," Stephens says.
French sociologist Jean-Claude Kaufmann says this is true overseas, too: "In Europe, and in France especially, there's a trend to show off the buttocks in place of breasts. This has to do with Latin American influences, but also the rise of Beyonce and stars like Rihanna," says Kaufmann, author of "Women's Bodies, Men's Gaze. Sociology of Naked Breasts."
Kaufmann also suggests economic reasons are at play: "In uncertain times, people look for security," he says. "Men are attracted to women's hips and the buttocks for security and reassurance. Women respond to this. It's deeply psychological."
Whatever the reason, the widespread interest in larger hind parts seems to have started when Kardashian's reality TV show, "Keeping up with the Kardashians," began airing seven years ago.
In a 2011 episode, she had an X-ray to prove she didn't have butt implants. Kardashian still frequently posts shots of her backside to her 21 million Instagram followers.
But the desire for big buns has intensified. This summer, the music video for "Anaconda" that showed Minaj in a pink thong was viewed 19.6 million times within 24 hours of its release — a record for music video site Vevo. It has racked up nearly 300 million views. The song has been on the top of the Billboard charts, too, right behind another anthem for curvy women, Meghan Trainor's "All About That Bass."
"I'm bringing booty back," Trainor sings.
Some businesses that specialize in butts say pop culture has had a direct impact on their bottom line.
A Brazilian butt lift, in which fat is sucked from a patient's stomach, love handles or back and put into their buttocks and hips, is increasingly popular in the U.S. This type of surgery, along with buttock implants, was the fastest-growing plastic surgery last year, with more than 11,000 procedures, up 58 percent from 2012, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.
Dr. Matthew Schulman, who performs the procedure in New York, says this year has been busier than last. Schulman, who charges $10,000 to $13,000 for the three-hour surgery, does six to eight Brazilian butt lifts weekly, up about 25 percent from a year ago.
He says when he asks patients which celebrity butt they want, the top names are Kardashian, Minaj and Lopez. Recently, more women have asked for a butt like Kardashian's sister, Khloe, who also stars in the reality show.
The downside of the new interest is that women desperate for cheap options have risked their lives, going to phony doctors that inject silicone, and even bathroom caulk, into their buttocks. Deaths have been reported in Miami, New York, Las Vegas and Jackson, Mississippi.
Another problem is doctors performing butt-enhancement surgeries that don't have experience. Schulman says about 20 percent of his patients come to him so he can fix lumps, bumps and uneven butt cheeks done by unskilled doctors.
Not everyone is trying surgery, though. Those looking for more natural ways to enhance their derriere are attending workout classes and watching workout videos that target the butt.
DailyBurn, which streams workout videos, says views for its "Butt, Hips and Thighs" video doubled in January and have remained popular. The video is so popular that DailyBurn is adding another butt workout clip in December.
At a gym in Boston, there's a waitlist for a $30 class that fits in 120 squats in 45 minutes. The class, Booty by Brabants, was started by Kelly Brabants a year ago. Brabants starts most classes, held at The Club by George Foreman III gym, with Lopez's "Booty" song.  By the end of the year, she plans to expand her brand by selling $65 workout leggings that help perk up the butt.
"It's not about being stick-thin anymore," says Brabants. "Every girl now wants a booty."

Goldman Sachs expects 25 bps rate cut in Feb  AprGoldman Sachs expects RBI to cut rate by 25 bps each in February and April
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 17, 2014  | 19:03 IST

The Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut key policy rates by 25 basis points each in February and April 2015 to bring the repo rate down to 7.5 per cent from 8 per cent currently, says a Goldman Sachs report.
"We have changed our rate call to build in 50 bps of rate cuts by the RBI in 1H2015 from our earlier call of RBI on hold," Goldman Sachs said in a research note adding "we expect the RBI to cut by 25bps each in February and April".
The global financial services major had earlier said that the central bank would keep its policy rates on hold.
The change in the global brokerage firm's rate cut view is largely because of the recent sharper than expected fall in headline inflation , contained core prices, and no sharp increase in food prices despite a weak monsoon.
Goldman Sachs noted that the RBI would not launch into an even more aggressive rate cutting cycle due to three reasons - entrenched inflation expectations, uncertainty about commodity prices and a new inflation targeting framework.
Moreover, the global brokerage major said both the trajectory and level of headline consumer prices and wholesale prices will give some comfort to the RBI.
"We cut our FY16 CPI inflation forecast substantially, to 5.8 per cent from 7.0 per cent earlier," it added.
Food prices are showing a lower trajectory than in previous few years, in part due to weak global agriculture prices, second round effects of weak fuel and transportation costs, and recent government measures to lower food prices such as lower minimum support price (MSP) increases.
"With these forecasts, we think the RBI can meet its 6 per cent target by January 2016. Near term risks to inflation are firmly to the downside. Given these forecasts, and the lags in transmission, we think the RBI will start cutting rates at its policy meeting in February," the report said.
Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan in September policy review left all key rates unchanged citing continued risks to inflation and difficult external situation especially on the geopolitical front. This was the fourth consecutive time that the RBI has kept key interest rates unaltered.
The short-term lending rate (repo) rate remained at 8 per cent, and the cash reserve requirement of banks at 4 per cent.
RBI's next policy review is on December 2.

Private life insurer Reliance Life Insurance on Monday tied up with global NGO 'Room to Read' to set up libraries across schools in India.
The partnership between Reliance Life and Room to Read aims to set up over 100 libraries in government primary schools and reach out to over 10,000 children across the country through this initiative, the company said in a statement.
"Through this partnership we will promote literacy and gender equality in the country by providing libraries in schools," Reliance Life Insurance CEO Anup Rau said.
"Libraries provide children an environment of knowledge and inculcate habits of learning and curiosity amongst young minds," he added.
Reliance Life Insurance and Room to Read will create and maintain libraries in municipal corporation schools across Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra in the first year of their programme.
The partnership, which is part of Reliance Life Insurance's Corporate Social Responsibility endeavour, will support more schools with such libraries in the following years.
Through this initiative, Reliance Life Insurance aims to compliment, support and strengthen the efforts of the government to improve the quality of education in India.

Toyota to start selling hydrogen FCV Mirai in DecToyota to start selling hydrogen fuel cell vehicle Mirai in December

Japanese auto major Toyota said on Tuesday that its "Mirai" hydrogen-powered vehicle will hit the Japanese market on December 15, making it the world's first seller of fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) for general consumers.
Mirai, which means "future" in English, will be sold at around 7,236,000 yen (about $62,000), Xinhua cited the automaker as saying, adding that it aims to sell about 400 units domestically by the end of 2015. It also plans to usher the green car into US and European markets next summer.
The new generation green car can drive up to 650 km on a single tank of hydrogen and emits only water vapour, according to Toyota , adding refueling only needs about three minutes.
The four-door sedan uses a system that features both fuel-cell and hybrid technologies, and also includes Toyota's new proprietary fuel-cell stack and high-pressure hydrogen tanks, the automaker said.
Toyota's president and CEO, Akio Toyoda, was quoted as saying in a video message Monday ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show that Mirai was a chance for Toyota to make a fundamental difference in the auto industry.
The paradigm shift by bringing FCVs into the mainstream has been equated with the 1997 launch of its then game-changing Prius hybrid by some industry experts.
"The four-door sedan represents a turning point for the automotive industry," said the CEO.
"All of us at Toyota believe in a future that will be safer, greener and easier for everyone," Toyoda added.

Game 7: Passive Anand holds Carlsen in a marathonVishwanathan Anand boldly chose an opening that had backfired in Chennai last year and was battling to draw game 7. Photo: AP

chess
In a cerebral discipline like chess, bravado sometimes serves as a surprise weapon. If the rival happens to be the game’s strongest player in a World title-match, there is always a strong likelihood of the ploy backfiring.
Trailing by a point and needing to at least hold Magnus Carlsen to a draw in Game 7, Anand boldly chose an opening that had backfired in Chennai last year. Anand looked fine into the middle game but Carlsen pushed him hard for the next five hours.
Anand eventually found the drawing continuation on the 70th move. Carlsen, however, kept the challenger busy by searching for more options. Anand, with less time on the clock, held firm.
Fabiano Caruana, the World No.2, seemed to have read it early; he tweeted: “Seems like people are overestimating white’s chances. The ending looks pretty drawish to me.” But it needed precise continuation from Anand to survive.
After suffering a loss with black pieces on Saturday, Anand was expected to prepare a suitable response to Carlsen for the crucial game.
Anand’s choice, if executed correctly, usually leads to a draw. Given Anand’s abilities to defend and Carlsen’s end-game skills, the game was fought for 122 moves though the result became clear much earlier. Eventually only the two kings and Carlsen’s knight were left on the board.
Carlsen would have been somewhat pleased with Anand choosing to repeat the Ruy Lopez Berlin seen in Game 2. After ending up losing that game, Anand was not expected to invite Carlsen to play the position again. But Anand seemed to back himself to get into Carlsen’s territory and come out unhurt; pulling it off would earn him a psychological point under the given circumstances.
When talking about his approach against Carlsen last year, Anand had said: “I made a decision not to avoid long games; well, not to be scared of them. If a long game happens, I should be ready to face a long battle, and if I make my point and confront him there, at his strongest point admittedly; if I can play a good long game and defend well, then it takes the pressure off me for everything else.”
Perhaps, Anand entered Monday’s game in a similar mindset. The fact that both players reeled off the first 23 moves rapidly, needing less than a minute per move, showed they were still in their home-preparation.
Until Anand’s 24th move, the position was identical to the one seen between Anish Giri and Teimour Radjabov this year in Tashkent. That game ended in a 52-move draw.
For the second successive day, the early queen-exchange dislodged Anand’s king. It did not matter since Anand looked prepared and was ready to get into the laborious Berlin endgame, with fewer pieces.
The first signs of worry for Anand came to the fore when he took nearly 28 minutes to respond to Carlsen’s knight move on the 28th turn. In comparison, by this time, Carlsen had consumed only 25 minutes.
In fact, Anand’s chosen move — bringing his knight to the centre of the board — only made things fractionally better for Carlsen. With plenty of time on his hands, Carlsen spent nearly 25 minutes to respond.
Thereafter, Anand did play with an extra pawn in the middle game but never really held any advantage. Once Carlsen exerted pressure from the kingside, Anand sensed trouble and sacrificed his bishop for a pawn.
Though white looked objectively better placed to win, Anand forced a position of his choice and, with it, kept the interest in the contest alive.

Training its guns on the Adani group, the Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday demanded immediate intervention of the banking sector regulator to scrutinise the MoU signed between the Adani Group and the State Bank of India.
The party said the Reserve Bank of India should step in and question the MoU since there is no justification for the largest public sector bank to provide Rs. 6000 crore loan.
“The banking sector regulator should scrutinise the improper memorandum of understanding between an Australian subsidiary company of the Adani Group and State Bank of India, which does not appear to be above board.
“The Reserve Bank of India, should fulfill its role of the regulator and must question the MoU, since there is no justification for the largest public sector bank of the country to provide a Rs. 6,000 crore loan, which is nothing but a sweet deal for the Adani Group,” the party said in a statement.
“Though details of the MoU continues to be a closely guarded secret, can the finance ministry deny a fact that many global banks had refused to extend the credit facility for this venture due to environmental reasons?” the party asked.
“Can the ministry deny that the SBI has been pressurised to bail out the Adani Group in a difficult venture the returns of which are uncertain ?
“If and when this company starts coal mining in distant future, will it not sell the coal in an open market at an international price ? Can the Finance Ministry deny this fact?” the party asked.

Customers are less and less happy with banksBy Jena McGregor November 18 Follow @jenamcgregor
Photographer Ron Antonelli/Bloomberg
Americans are less happy with their banks in 2014 than in previous years, marking a dip in what looked like an upward trend in customer satisfaction with the industry. And they're even more fed up with their health insurers, whose scores from customers in the American Customer Satisfaction Index have sunk to a 10-year low.
The ACSI, one of the broadest measurements of customer experiences, released its report Tuesday on the finance and insurance sectors, based on input from roughly 6,800 Americans about more than 230 companies. For several of the industries involved, the news isn't good.
Customer satisfaction scores for retail banks dropped 2.6 percent, nearly reversing two years of improvement. Overall happiness with health insurers fell for the first time in three years, dropping 4.1 percent to an industry score that's only a notch above America's most-reviled industries: airlines, cable companies and Internet service providers. Meanwhile, dissatisfaction with higher premiums led to lower scores for other insurers, such as life, home and auto insurance providers.
Americans are much happier, meanwhile, with their credit unions, which held steady with the second highest industry score of all. And fueled by a booming stock market, satisfaction with online brokerages ticked upward, with scores rising 2.5 percent in 2014.
And yet, the research found a growing unease with banks. According to the report, this was partly due to less competitive interest rates and harder-to-find branches and ATMs. Leaders in these industries might also want to work on how quickly financial transactions are completed, how courteous and helpful their staff are with customers, and how easy it is to understand information and make changes to accounts — all factors that got poorer scores this year.
The dip in customer satisfaction also coincides with a rise in fees, said ACSI Director David VanAmburg, particularly among smaller banks, where scores fell the most. The ACSI measures customer satisfaction by asking about both the quality of the service a customer receives and the value they believe they're getting. Fees are playing both a direct and indirect role in shaping those impressions, VanAmburg said. On the one hand, customers are unhappy with banks that make them pay fees. On the other, banks that charge fewer fees often do so by cutting into service levels, which also yields unhappy customers.
"As banks try to get fees and aren't successful at doing so, they have to cut costs — reducing the number of branches, downsizing staff — which results in lower satisfaction scores," VanAmburg said.
Even with a significant drop in their scores, regional and smaller banks still did better than all of their big national peers. Among the four largest banks, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup were tied for the highest score, Wells Fargo came in second and Bank of America last. With the exception of JPMorgan Chase, whose score dipped three percent from 2013, the banks' scores held steady from the year before.
An e-mail to JPMorgan Chase about the drop was not immediately returned. A Bank of America spokesman said that ACSI's data showed it was making progress in some categories, "but we know we still have some work left to do."
Health insurers, meanwhile, saw their lowest score since 2005. They have never done well in the index — the complexity, frequent use of claims processes and high costs of health insurance have long made them part of an industry consumers love to hate. Yet among the major health insurers studied, UnitedHealth was on top, seeing a three percent gain from the year before. Aetna received the lowest score, with a six percent drop in its customer satisfaction figure from 2013. (Aetna was not immediately able to respond to the report.)
ACSI attributed this to higher costs and limited choice for group plans. While the effect of the Affordable Care Act on customer satisfaction is unclear, VanAmburg said it's possible all the recent attention given to health insurance in the wake of the Affordable Care Act could be playing a role in customers' increasingly negative views. "It's just a constant noise, a constant buzz, that is seldom positive. It can have a negative impact overall on how customers perceive even their actual experiences."
If there's a key lesson for industry leaders from the report, VanAmburg said, it's that technology can majorly improve customer satisfaction. While there are exceptions (self check-out lines, for instance, can often frustrate consumers), in many ways Web sites, chat help and other tech tools have been able to address customers' needs more smoothly. Banks, he said, have been particularly good at adding these features over the years, allowing much to be done online without having to go to a branch or make a phone call.
"The extent to which companies can help us satisfy ourselves — essentially, let us provide our own customer service — [works] very much to their advantage," VanAmburg said. "Let's face it. As long as technologies work, they can't have a bad day."

Commentary: Celebrating women s successes  not bemoaning tech barriers0
And Dr. Anita Goel, chairman and CEO of Massachusetts-based Nanobiosym, presented her Gene-Radar, a handheld machine that can diagnose patients using blood or saliva samples in real time, anywhere. That sort of device can help democratize and decentralize health care, Goel said. She bridged physics and medicine to hasten that revolution.
These women represent the “can” of women in STEM, a story that too often goes untold.
Dorri McWhorter, CEO of YWCA Metropolitan Chicago, said she appreciated that the panelists didn’t focus on the areas in which women aren’t represented. Instead, they illustrated what scientists who happen to be women achieve.
“They’re very cognizant that they’re women doing it, but they don’t have that sort of bitterness to them,” McWhorter said. “They have sort of an inspiration and light to them about what they’re doing.”
The conversation surrounding women in STEM is complicated. It requires participants to acknowledge the obstacles that often discourage progress while also asking whether belaboring those challenges is productive. But leaders should ensure that the conversation includes diverse stories of success, stories that don't focus on the barriers successful women broke through along the way. They should highlight the women who made it to the top because their arrival there makes clear that we can do it.
For all attendees, the message of unapologetic success rang clearly. The women I spoke with expressed awe and pride.
Perhaps 2015 can be the year in which all-female panels of this caliber drop the “Women in” qualifier and draw attendees based on ideas alone.

The founder of Freshwater Advisors on the importance of a fast  no0
A. I consider some of our work hybrid municipal-program design and some direct corporate consulting like the CME Group. We have been hired as consultants-of-record for the Illinois Corporate Startup Challenge, which is the keystone program in the state connecting corporations for the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Every six months we run three to five corporations through this program. That is how we’ve gotten eight companies, including State Farm, Allstate, Hyatt and Exelon. Now we're doing program design work for the city’s innovation council, ChicagoNext, and we're developing a new program called the Cleantech Innovation Bridge in collaboration with the Clean Energy Trust.
Q. What inspired this business?
A. When I ran BlueMeteor (a former technology startup), I couldn’t get any local major corporations. When I did my first Fortune 500 deal, which yielded $2 million in revenue, it changed my entire business model. To get 20 to 50 people together from a large corporation together on one day focused around that stuff, that’s bringing efficiency to a very inefficient process. I started the CEC right after BlueMeteor was wound down. The greatest things you can do for entrepreneurs are to help make introductions to customers, help them raise capital and help them find mentors to traverse their entrepreneurial journey.
Q. What did you learn from that experience?
A. I started my first company, BlueMeteor, in my late 20s and raised $31 million and did not make it. In large corporations, there’s always the naysayer who says things, like, “We don’t know if this company is going to last, so should we do a deal with them?” One of the greatest lessons I’ve learned is you can do smaller, more agile experimentation as a means for engagement, which reduces risk on both sides.
Q. How can startups approach corporations without getting strung along?
A. The key is when you have that meeting with the corporation, it is OK to get a “no” as long as it’s fast. A slow “no” or a “maybe” is the death of an entrepreneur. Once you put your stuff on the table, ask “Does this fit into your roadmap? Are you willing to experiment, or should we wait and come back in another year?” While that may be uncomfortable, it prevents the slow, endless meeting to get to nowhere. If it’s “no,” the meeting is over right there. But ask that question and then manage expectations. “How do you see engagement occurring with us? Would this be in the form of a pilot, and is this something we can work towards?” If the answer is “no,” then the meeting is over.

Tips to Network Like a Pro and Grow Your Small Businessreddit
People want to buy products and services from businesses run by people they like, know and trust.  This means that as a small business owner, your personal network becomes your net worth in business. You must work at building great word of mouth about your business -- to grow sales and encourage customers to come back for more. Growing your business with repeat customers will ensure it'll be around for the long haul. If you're not paying attention to building and maintaining your network, your sales will dry up, leaving you scrambling to find new customers. How do you create a new referral stream? You hit the ground running at networking events and build new relationships. Here are some tips to network like a pro and grow your small business.
Have a Plan for the Networking Event
When you buy a ticket to an event, you should immediately pick out key targets in advance to build your network. Look at the invitation, the host committee or board list to figure out who you might want to meet. Take a friend and split up so you can work both sides of the room.
Create a Networking Goal
When you attend a networking event, focus on meeting only five quality contacts. The reason for this is that you only have a small amount of time to follow up with new people, so five is a manageable number.
The Reception is the Event
Any event you attend that has a reception, as far as I am concerned, is the main event. You need to be early and be ready to network with a great elevator pitch. Focus on using my "X+Y=Z" method. Develop a memorable sentence that explains," I do X for Y target audience and deliver Z results."
Be More Interested, Than Interesting
When it comes to networking, focus on listening first. It's all about "Give to Get". You should seek to serve before even thinking about making a sale. We all have two ears and one mouth for a reason, start by listening and seek to help, then your new contact will of course treat you the same way.
No Drive-by Networking
One thing that drives me crazy at a networking event is when someone walks up to me, when I am standing with a small group, and without speaking, hands me a business card. If I have no idea who the person is, I am surely going to trash the card. ONLY give a business card when asked for one.
Your Fortune is in Your Follow-up
Once you meet a new contact, particularly if it's a warm or hot lead, you have just 48 hours to reach out to them and follow-up. I would start by connecting via LinkedIn, and then send an email or call to make an appointment. Hand written notes are great too, if you are in the same town as your contact. Networking follow up is all about speed to keep you business top of mind.
You Can't Bring Your A Game in Your B Suit!
Presentation is EVERYTHING! When you attend a networking event, you should look like someone that your target audience should be talking to. You should look like money and success to get attention. Ladies, be careful not to go too tight or short and men, make sure your shoes are perfectly shined.
Networking and generating sales can be really tough without a process. Could you use some help with your sales? I have a gift for you. One of my favorite sales experts, Jeffrey Gitomer and I are giving you a free webinar series called, "How to Really Make Sales." You know Jeffrey from his New York Times Bestseller, "The Little Red Book of Selling."

Comcast  Time Warner Cable Pulling Down Entire Industry s Reputationreddit
Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter are giving satellite and cable providers a bad rap.
The three companies helped land the cable and satellite TV industry dead last in a recent YouGov BrandIndex survey of consumer satisfaction.
The market research firm asked 9,000 people in an online survey whether they considered themselves satisfied or dissatisfied customers of over 1,200 different companies. It released the results of its poll on Monday .
It turns out that people are more satisfied with banks, credit card companies, airlines and the makers of medication for erectile disfunction than they are with the companies that provide them with TV and Internet.
Here are the industries that received the highest rankings for customer satisfaction:
Time Warner Cable, Comcast and Charter Communications all received negative scores in the YouGov survey, meaning that more customers reported being dissatisfied with the companies than reported being satisfied.
Time Warner Cable and Comcast's scores were "firmly" negative, said Lance Fraenkel, head of client services for BrandIndex. Charter Communications' score was negative, but hovered around neutral territory.
Here are the industries that came out on bottom in the survey:
The results of the survey come as Comcast, the largest cable company in the U.S., is attempting to buy Time Warner Cable, the second-largest, for $45 billion. The deal still needs to be approved by regulators.
The 10 other companies in the "cable and satellite TV" category all received positive rankings, with Verizon FiOS and AT&T U-verse topping the list, Fraenkel said.
"If you have a couple brands in negative territory and the category average is still firmly positive, then you know that there are brands that perform well in the sector," Fraenkel told The Huffington Post.
Time Warner Cable has traditionally had negative satisfaction scores, Fraenkel said. Comcast used to average a neutral score, but the company took a hit after the recording of Ryan Block's "customer service call from Hell" went viral over the summer, Fraenkel said. During the call, an aggressive Comcast agent made it very difficult for Block -- a product manager at AOL, the parent company of HuffPost -- to cancel his Comcast service.
"That to me stands out as a major event over the last few months that has damaged the brand and category perception," Fraenkel said.
In a statement to HuffPost, Comcast said it's "working hard and making significant investments to improve our customers' experience with us, and we know these results are not where they need to be."
Comcast said it has "put a team in place to listen to feedback from customers and employees and to rethink the way we interact with our customers," and that it has "been investing billions of dollars and making major operational changes to make it easy for our customers to do business with us." The company has "made this our number one priority,” it said.
Time Warner Cable also said it is investing billions of dollars in customer experience and now offers more weekend and evening appointment options, as well as one-hour appointment windows.
“We are always looking for ways to deliver improved value, reliability and service to our customers," Time Warner Cable said in a statement to HuffPost.
A representative from Charter Communications declined to comment for the story.
YouGov conducts regular polls for HuffPost, but the BrandIndex research was not part of that partnership.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this article mistakenly listed "Tools: Hardware" on the chart of categories receiving a low rate of satisfaction from consumers. It received a high rate of satisfaction.

Japan Slips Back Into RecessionJapan Slips Back Into Recession

TOKYO (AP) — Japan's economy unexpectedly shrank in the third quarter as housing and business investment declined following a tax hike, dragging the country into a recession and further clouding the outlook for the global economy.
The world's third-largest economy contracted at a 1.6 percent pace in the July-September quarter, the government said Monday, contrary to predictions it would grow after a big drop the previous quarter. The surprise deepens uncertainty when China's growth is slowing and the 18-country eurozone grew only 0.2 percent in the same quarter.
The gross domestic product figures showed across-the-board weakness in demand among consumers, manufacturers and builders. Many individuals and companies had spent money before the sales tax was hiked in April from 5 percent to 8 percent, and spending has languished since then.
"The impact of the sales tax was much more severe than expected," said Junko Nishioka, an economist at RBS Japan Securities.
Housing investment plunged 24 percent from the same quarter a year ago, while corporate capital investment sank 0.9 percent. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy, edged up just 0.4 percent.
Given the contraction, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to put off another sales tax hike planned for next October, slowing progress on efforts to rein in Japan's government debt, the largest among industrialized nations.
He also will likely make the dismal GDP reading the basis for calling a general election in mid-December to underpin the public mandate for his "Abenomics" policies of lax monetary policy, fiscal spending and structural economic reforms.
Japan emerged from its last recession just as Abe took office in December 2012, vowing to restore the nations' economic vigor after two decades of stagnation.
But the country is struggling to regain momentum as its population declines and ages. Apart from its automakers, many of its manufacturers have lost their leading edge in innovation while shifting production to cheaper locations offshore.
Household incomes, meanwhile, peaked more than a decade ago, and a growing share of workers are having difficulty making ends meet with part-time, contract work. Wage increases — mostly limited to a small share of workers in big-name companies — have lagged behind inflation.
Most economists had forecast that Japan would expand at about a 2 percent pace after a sharp 7.1 percent annual pace drop in April-June immediately following the tax hike. A recession commonly is regarded as two straight quarters of economic contraction. Compared to the previous quarter, GDP declined 0.4 percent.
While delaying the next tax hike could undermine confidence in Japan's ability to repair its battered finances, Abe and his advisers appear to view the threat to Japan's recovery as the more urgent risk.
In early 2013, Abe and Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda united in seeking to end the long spell of deflation that they say is discouraging companies and consumers from spending money.
So far, price increases have fallen short of their inflation target of 2 percent, with most of the increases coming from the sales tax hike and from higher costs for imports due to extreme monetary that has helped drive the value of the Japanese yen to seven-year lows against the U.S. dollar.
On Oct. 31, Kuroda announced the central bank would step up its asset purchases, accelerating Japan's "quantitative easing" just as the U.S. was ending its own asset purchases. Despite that surprise move, Kuroda has insisted that the economy is still in the midst of a "moderate recovery."
The BOJ's move, along with a government decision to shift a large share of the public pension fund investments out of government bonds and into higher yielding but riskier shares, pushed Japan's share benchmark to seven-year highs this month.
But in morning trading, the Nikkei 225 stock index tumbled 2.6 percent to 17,037.65.
Monday's data is preliminary, with a revision due Dec. 8. Since some of the decline was due to reductions in inventory, things may not be as bad as the GDP reading suggests, economists said.
Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York, said increased business orders in the past three months for machinery, industrial equipment and other big ticket items should boost output in the coming months.
Abe already was expected to announce additional economic stimulus this week. The dismal Monday morning data will probably lead him to announce a package worth about 3 trillion yen to 4 trillion yen ($26 billion to $35 billion), Nishioka said.
That could include subsidies to low-income families and help for small and medium-sized companies that rely on imported components and energy that have suffered as the Japanese yen has weakened from about 80 to the dollar to its current level of about 116 to the dollar — a move that has helped exporters.
Critics say Abe has failed to deliver on promises for drastic reforms of labor regulations, the tax system and the health industry, among other areas. Meanwhile, companies have largely refrained from passing windfall gains from share price gains and surging profits on to their workers in the form of higher wages.

Chocolate Companies Warn Of Looming Global ShortageChocolate Companies Warn Of Looming Global Shortage

Bad news: chocolate, the delicacy of choice for children, chocoholics and depressives everywhere, has become increasingly expensive.
Now comes even worse news: global supplies of the brown stuff are becoming increasingly scarce, according to one report.
The Washington Post reported on Saturday that due to a host of factors, a perfect storm is brewing that is creating a worldwide shortage of chocolate. According to the report, two of the world's largest chocolate confectionaries, Mars and Barry Callebaut, are sounding alarm bells.
Cocoa—the base ingredient for chocolate—has surged this year by at least 10 percent, on the heels of a 20 percent run up last year. The commodity's surging price, led mostly by surging emerging market demand, has led some analysts to believe chocolate may eventually become a luxury item.

How iPads in classrooms are helping kids in Prince Georges CountyBy Hayley Tsukayama November 18 Follow @htsuka
( Noah Berger/Bloomberg)
The jury is still out on how much, exactly, students benefit from having tablets in the classroom . But as a part of its large and ongoing effort to keep hold of the education technology market, Apple released a video Tuesday to show how students benefit from having Apple products in the classroom.
The video  showcases Apple's education efforts in Prince George's County Public Schools in Maryland. The suburban Washington, D.C., school system has given an iPad to each student and teacher at four of its middle schools, all of which receive federal  Title I funding -- a federal program to help schools with a high percentage of low-income students.
The video focuses primarily on Buck Lodge Middle School, where students use the tablets  to shoot video, create presentations and work with educational software as part of their daily class work. Proponents of equipping students with iPads say that using the tablets improves learning in several ways, including giving teachers personalized data from apps to show where students need the most help.
The school district was also highlighted as a success story in an education report Apple released last week,  which included positive statistics from iPad-using schools across the country. According to that report, 175 percent more students at the Prince George's schools that use the tablet programs are at "advanced"-level math compared with similar schools without iPad programs. There's also been a 35 percent increase in the number of students in the iPad programs who've reached an "advanced" reading level, according to Apple's statistics.
Technology programs like this one have their critics. A much-touted initiative at the Los Angeles Unified School District was halted after fielding harsh criticism -- mostly over questions about the contract negotiations between Apple and the school district. But the school system also faced concerns that students were getting around browser restrictions on the tablets in order to use them for play, rather than academics. Others have questioned whether the benefits of these programs justify the cost of equipping every student with a $400 to $500 tablet.
At Buck Lodge, only select students are allowed to take their iPads home -- everyone else leaves them at school each day. But principal James Richardson said that  he's never seen a problem with how students used the tablets. Nor has he noticed other problems that critics have raised, he said, such as the worry that equipping kids with expensive gadgets raises their risk of being robbed.
Even with 400 iPads in student homes, Richardson said, "I didn't see any issues that alarmed me, where I would say I don't want to do this again."
In fact, Richardson said he's seen so much success come out of the tablet program at his school that he would like to see all students take the tablets home. Even rolling out one-to-one tablet programs in the classrooms, Richardson said, has been exciting for students and for teachers -- who don't have to spend as much time on non-teaching tasks, such as copying worksheets. Changing the classroom setting to work with tablets, Richardson said, has made converts of nearly all of his staff -- even those who were wary of the tablet classroom concept when it was introduced three years ago.
"Our attendance has increased; behavior problems have decreased," he said. "We're changing the learning culture in our schools."
Buck Lodge Middle School has gotten a lot of attention on the national stage for its tech-forward programs. Earlier this year, it was chosen as the site where President Obama launched the "ConnectED" initiative , a joint push by the Federal Communications Commission and companies including Apple, Microsoft, Sprint and Verizon to get high-speed wireless and next-generation broadband in schools around the country.

Under fire  Uber argues rider data is confidentialBy Nancy Scola November 18 Follow @nancyscola
Facing heat over reports that the company had accessed a BuzzFeed journalist's user record without her permission to make a point, the ride-sharing company Uber posted an update on its company blog on Tuesday night affirming that rider data is "confidential information" that will only be accessed by company employees in a narrow set of circumstances.
Call it "Uber-rider confidentially," and the pointed response is a sign that the company gets the existential threat to its business it is facing. Data is in many ways the company's greatest assets , but it also opens it up to worries that the company possesses both a tremendous amount of data and a willingness to use it against the many critics the company has acquired along the way.
Tuesday's blog post, from spokesperson Nairi Hourdajian, isn't framed as a change in approach, but rather a reiteration that the company's policy is to only use rider data for "legitimate business purposes."
The post adds new details to the debate by explaining that those purposes include -- but aren't limited to -- solving riders problems, processing payments for drivers, keeping track of fraud and, writes Hourdajian, "reviewing specific rider or driver accounts in order to troubleshoot bugs."
Uber hasn't said yet whether rider data was indeed accessed in the case reported by BuzzFeed. But the blog post hints at a mea culpa. "As the company continues to grow," writes Hourdajian, "we will continue to be transparent about our policy and ensure that it is properly understood by our employees."
Update: Asked about the two situations detailed by BuzzFeed -- one report of a company executive floating the idea of using opposition researchers to investigate troublesome journalists and another of a company manager accessing a reporter's user profile without permission -- Uber spokesperson Nairi Hourdajian writes in an email that "we are currently investigating the incidents you reference."

Where Is Homeownership Within Reach Of The Middle Class And Millennialsreddit
Despite high household incomes, San Francisco is the least affordable metro, with just 15% of homes within reach of the middle class. Affordability has deteriorated over the past year in Austin and Miami. The most affordable markets are near the Great Lakes.
Where can the middle class bear the cost of buying a home? In the past year, affordability has fallen modestly, hurt by rising home prices, but helped by lower mortgage rates. Nationally, 59% of homes for sale are within reach of the middle class, compared with 62% last October. Nonetheless, the big picture is that prices still look undervalued compared with fundamentals and historically low mortgage rates make buying much cheaper than renting . Still, affordability is a growing problem.
We measure affordability as the share of homes for sale on Trulia within reach of a middle-class household. Our standard is whether the total monthly payment, including mortgage, insurance, and property taxes, is less than 31% of the metro area's median household income. (See note below.) We define middle class separately for each metro based on the local median household income. Thus, what we consider affordable varies from market to market.
For instance, in metro Atlanta, median household income is $55,000. Homes priced under $276,000 are affordable based on the 31% guideline. On November 7, 2014, 71% of the homes for sale in Atlanta were listed for less than $276,000. That means that more than two-thirds of metro Atlanta homes are within reach of the middle class.
Austin and Miami Join California Markets on the Least Affordable List
The five most affordable markets are in Ohio, Indiana, and upstate New York. In those markets, more than 80% of homes for sale are within reach of the middle class. The South is relatively affordable too, with Birmingham, AL and Columbia, SC among the 10 most affordable markets.

2 Life-Changing Lessons You Need to Know Now!reddit
Lesson #1: It's easier to see our problems (let's call them behavioral challenges) in others than to see them in ourselves. For instance, often when I become self-righteous or angry about some perceived injustice, I realize that the deeper issue is often not with "it," but in me.
Lesson #2: Although we may deny our behavioral challenges to ourselves, they may be very obvious to the people who observe us. There is often a great discrepancy between the self we think we are and the self the rest of the world sees in us. If we can listen and think about what others see in us, we can compare the self we want to be with the self that we are presenting. Then and only then can we begin to make the real changes that we need to make to align our stated values with our actual behavior.
Let me give you a personal example:
As a Ph.D. student at UCLA in the 70s, I had a self-image of being 'hip.' I believed I was involved in discovering deeper human understanding, self-actualization and profound wisdom. One of my teachers, Dr. Bob Tannenbaum, had invented 'sensitivity training,' published a popular article in the Harvard Business Review and was a full professor. I was impressed!
In Bob's class, we could discuss anything we wanted. So, for three weeks, I did a monologue about how 'screwed up' people in Los Angeles were. "They wear sequined blue jeans; they drive gold Rolls Royces; they are plastic and materialistic; all they care about is impressing others; they don't understand what is important in life." I ranted. (I'm not sure how growing up in a small town Kentucky had made an expert on LA people, but evidently it had.)
After listening to me babble for three weeks, Bob looked at me quizzically and asked, "Who are you talking to?"
"I'm speaking to the group," I said.
"Who in the group are you talking to?"
"I'm talking to everybody," I said, not knowing the treacherous path of self-discovery down which I was being led!
"When you speak, you look at only one person and address your comments toward only one person. You seem interested in the opinion of only one person. Who is that person?"
"That is interesting,'" I replied. After careful consideration, I asked, "You?"
"That's right, me. There are 12 other people in this room. Why aren't you interested in any of them?" he asked.
At this point, I decided that digging my hole deeper was better than admitting defeat, so I said, "Well, Dr. Tannenbaum, you understand the significance of what I am saying. You know how 'screwed-up' it is to try to run around and impress people all the time. You have a deeper understanding of what is really important in life."
"Marshall, is there any chance that for the last three weeks all you've tried to do is impress me?" Bob asked.
I was amazed Bob's lack of insight! "Not at all!" I declared. "You haven't understood one thing I've said! I've told you how screwed up it is to try to impress other people. You've missed my point, and I'm disappointed in your lack of understanding!"
He scratched his beard and concluded, "No. I think I understand." I looked at the group and could see them nod and agree.
For six months, I disliked Dr. Tannenbaum. I devoted a lot of energy into trying to understand why he was so confused. Then one day, it clicked! The person with the issue about impressing other people was me. I was the one who had been trying to impress Dr. Tannenbaum. That day, I looked in the mirror and said, "Dr. Tannenbaum was right."
So, let me ask you: Can you see in yourself what others see in you, or do you see in others what you don't see in yourself? What are you going to do about it?

Eduardo Mapa: The Future Belongs to Those Who Dare to Be Firstreddit
This is part of the #CareerAdvice series -- featuring successful professionals who share their advice to people who would want to take their career to the next level.
We all have to constantly face challenges in our careers, especially those who are just starting up.  So I thought what would be better way to learn than from those who have been through a lot of challenges and been able to overcome those with series of sweet triumphs along the way.
Eduardo Mapa of Havas Media China
I've caught up with Eduardo Mapa , the Chief Executive Officer, Havas Digital of Havas Media China. He's the man who started his career as a sales and marketing person and eventually becoming one of the pioneering and most respected advertising professionals in the Philippines and the whole Asia Pacific. Having worked in one of the most challenging industries, here's some golden nuggets from the interview.
Can you tell us a bit about how you started your career?
I started my career in advertising by some quirk of a chance. I was previously in sales and marketing for a tourism magazine based in Cebu City, Philippines. I've always been fascinated with the roller coaster world of advertising but never thought I'd come into the industry this way.
One day, some 20 years ago, I had set a sales meeting with the head of a global ad agency based in Cebu. During those days, setting up a schedule with a general manager was not often easy. So, I prepared hard for my sales pitch knowing that I ought to make the best of this chance.
And on that day, just moments after I wrapped up my sales presentation, he looked at me and offered me a job! Instead of walking away with a sale, I ended up with the door key to the advertising world. The rest as they say, is history. While my roots have always been in a creative agency, I have been privileged to have cross over to public relations, digital and into media. My 18 years in the Havas network has led me to stints in Singapore, India and now in China.
What are some of your best moments in your professional life?
I love the challenge of building winning teams. And when we accomplish much with just little to work on, these are the moments that give me a head rush.
A.) In 2003, I went back to Manila after a stint in Singapore office to form a team to handle the P&G's soap brand - Zest. We went to help the brand double its sales in just 14 months and were given recognition by global P&G Zest as the "best team in worldwide Zest league".
B.) In 2008, I formed the Media Contacts. A digital agency with a rag-tag team of 11 young mavericks that I hand picked and mentored. The team of 11 not only won the trust of Unilever at that time, but went on to become the first back-to-back Media Agency of the Year (AOY)  at the Philippine Advertising Congress' Araw Awards, beating the bigger and more established ones. We won our first AOY on our first year.
C.) International Jury duties, I would like to believe, is one that most advertising executives would be honoured and privileged to be part of.
To be chosen by the China Advertising Industry to be a Media Jury for the 2014 Cannes Lions Festival was momentous for me.
Most meaningful however, was when I was given the honour to be part of the jury panel in selecting China's representative to the 2014 Young Cannes Lions. Leading the media jury panel that selected two young Chinese future talents that went on to win Gold for China was a fulfilling and humbling experience.
.
If you could advise your 20-year-old-self today, what would tell him?
Life is a marathon not a sprint, Ed. Don't be in a mad rush to accomplish so much in a short period of time. In the end, how you play the long game that matters most.
What has been the most valuable advice you've ever gotten when you were facing challenges in your career?
Bob Schmetterer, former Euro RSCG (now Havas Worldwide) global chairman once said " The future belongs to those who dare to be first."
The journey of being first, where no one dares to go, is never for the faint-hearted. And I constantly use this quote to remind myself to slug it out through the challenging times.
What would you advice the millennial just starting with their career or aiming to take their careers to the next level?
Be Like A Sponge.
Learn as much as you can. Distill and filter those learning. Fill up your knowledge knapsack. Someday, those learning nuggets in your knapsack will come handy. Never say you've learned enough, for life is a continuing learning journey.  Up to now, I still want to learn more. I ask. I seek. I search. I discover.
Never be afraid to experience life in the trenches.
The experience of succeeding while having so little to work on, will not only sharpen one's skill sets but also give a new perspective when one has more than enough. Surviving and winning battles in the trenches makes one, battle scarred so to speak. These experiences shape good generals in the future.
Have the courage to be true to who you are.
All my life, I've always been an underdog. My story is an open book. I've encountered so many critics and doubting Virginias along the way. They never deterred me to focus on my style and my passion. I've made my mistakes and learned from them. But I never let go of who I am. So, embrace who you are - with all the faults and strengths. Improve thy self but stay true to you.

How Vivian Krause Became The Poster Child For Canada s Anti-Environment CrusadeLast week, Vivian Krause published an opinion piece in claiming that a vote for Vision Vancouver is a vote for U.S. interests .
So, you might be wondering: just who is Vivian Krause? We're so glad you asked...
An essential component of all public relations campaigns is having the right messenger -- a credible, impassioned champion of your cause.
While many PR pushes fail to get off the ground, those that really catch on -- the ones that gain political attention and result in debates and senate inquiries -- almost always have precisely the right poster child.
And in the federal government and oil industry's plight to discredit environmental groups, the perfect poster child just so happens to be Vivian Krause .
Krause describes herself as an independent researcher asking " fair questions " about American funding of Canadian environmental groups. She blogged for many years in relative obscurity before becoming the federal Conservatives' favourite attack dog.
Krause's moment in the sun came in 2012 when Joe Oliver, Canada's then natural resources minister, released his infamous letter decrying "foreign-funded radical" environmentalists for "hijacking" the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline review process.
Krause had primed the pump for the Conservatives to swoop in and achieve their goal -- to discredit environmental groups by building a public narrative about them acting nefariously, thereby justifying spending millions of dollars on audits of charities' political activities.
Never mind that philanthropic dollars cross international borders all the time. Never mind that the Northern Gateway proposal is sponsored by China's state-owned oil company Sinopec, along with many other foreign oil companies. Never mind that there's probably no more legitimate participation in a democracy than citizens signing up to speak at public hearings.
No, once you have a vendetta, inconvenient facts don't matter. And Krause's vendetta against environmental groups has been in the works for a long time -- ever since she worked in public relations for the farmed salmon industry.
The salmon farming industry and the birth of a vendetta
It was due to her interest in promoting salmon farming that Krause started rifling through the tax returns of large American foundations supporting wild salmon advocacy in Canada.
It didn't take long for Krause to cook up a conspiracy theory involving American foundations working to undermine Canadian interests -- and then to expand that theory to any number of conservation issues in Canada, with a special focus on conservation campaigns that were inconvenient for the oil industry.
To Krause, it seemed suspicious that foundations from across the border were giving money to Canadian groups working on Canadian conservation and energy issues. It must be, Krause surmised, that these big foundations are spending their dollars to manipulate Canadian energy and environment politics to further American interests. And, she went further to suggest, these Canadian groups are acting as pawns of these suspicious foundations.
Speaking of suspicious, by early 2013, Krause had admitted that more than 90 per cent of her income for 2012 had come from oil, gas and mining interests . Groups paying Krause's speaker's fees included the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, the Association for Mineral Exploration and the Vancouver Board of Trade.
Convenient aversion to climate change facts
Fast forward to this week when Krause couldn't resist weighing into the Vancouver election campaign , claiming that: "For Canada, there is no single economic issue that is more important than getting Alberta oil to global markets."
While oil is no doubt an important part of the Canadian economy, Krause's statement overlooks two inconvenient facts:
1) According to Statistics Canada, the oilsands account for only two per cent of the national GDP .
2) A study by Simon Fraser University and The Goodman Group Ltd. released this week finds Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain jobs promises are overblown and recommends the proposed expansion be rejected as it is neither in the economic nor public interest of B.C.and Metro Vancouver.
The argument that continued oilsands expansion is a positive for the Canadian economy -- and more to the point, the Metro Vancouver economy -- is far from a slam dunk.
While Krause enjoys spinning another of her clandestine tales in linking Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson to U.S. foundations, it's increasingly clear that it's all a convenient cover story for her to push her own view that the fossil fuel industry should be allowed to expand.
"Voting for Gregor Robertson means voting to support a U.S.-funded, anti-pipeline campaign that continues the U.S. monopoly on Canadian oil, keeping Canada over a barrel," Krause writes. "When you go to the poll, don't vote for Gregor Robertson. Vote for Canada."
Perhaps Krause missed the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which states that governments need to peak emissions, rapidly phase out fossil fuels and transition to 100 per cent renewable energy pronto? Rapidly expanding the oilsands and building new pipelines to serve that expansion doesn't actually fit into any plans to have an inhabitable earth -- not to mention the terrifying consequences an oil spill could reap on Vancouver .
If Krause's modus operandi is climate change denial, it would be nice if she just stated that right up front, instead of conveniently ignoring it.
(If you want to know where we're coming from at DeSmog Canada, mosey on over to our About Us page , where you can find out. Hint: we agree with 97 per cent of scientists about climate change; we're proud to accept donations from anyone who supports our mission; and we're not going to tell you how to vote because that's not our thing.)
In a recent op-ed in the Calgary Herald, Barry Cooper , a University of Calgary professor and known climate skeptic called on Alberta Premier Jim Prentice to use Krause as an attack dog against environmental groups .
"[Prentice] knows from his work with Enbridge and B.C. First Nations that the real source of opposition to Northern Gateway are the enviros and the deep-pocketed American foundations that fund them," Cooper wrote. "So, Jim, hire Vivian Krause, who has done a lot of work on this problem, and use the government megaphone to publicize her analyses of the pernicious sources of enviro funding."
Which raises the question: did someone hire Krause to weigh in -- clumsy as it may be -- on the Vancouver election?

Should Employees Review Their Bossesreddit
A Gallup study released in 2012 found that 70 percent of American workers reported being disengaged at work, costing the American economy an estimated $450-550 billion annually. That same poll also found that managers are directly responsible for their employee's level of engagement. Bad bosses are bad for business.
An employee giving their employer feedback isn't revolutionary, and I've known plenty of business owners who ask for it.
But I'm not sure if it's enough to just, off-the-cuff, ask people how they feel the company is being led. After all, we set apart time for employee reviews, why shouldn't there be something similar for the managers and executives? I feel there should be; it's just important that the review is structured the right way.
Ask for anonymous feedback
I used to ask people for feedback during our annual, individual employee reviews. And, of course, they all thought I was doing great. There aren't a lot of people willing to give their boss honest feedback while face-to-face, lest they be branded as having a 'bad attitude.' But if you actually set a time for your staff to review you, you can give them a shield of anonymity. This year I chose to do the reviews a bit differently, and have everyone review everyone using a generic feedback sheet, which I included my name on. So everyone has the opportunity to 'rank' my performance in a few, key areas, without anyone knowing who filled out what sheet. Not only does this give the people who do have problems with how I run the company a chance to say so, but it also helps show me the general feelings of the office so I can guide my eventual review. Employees that feel their opinions matter are much, more likely to be engaged at work than those that feel as though they are just another cog in the machine.
Hold an actual, office-wide review
Talking to my team has inspired some of my best ideas, and when you're trying to plan out the direction for next year, it can really help to have the input of those who work directly with your customers. Use the general, anonymous feedback you got to figure out what the majority of the office might want to talk about. And when you're leading the longer, office-wide discussion, don't be accusatory -- the last thing you want is to ask things like 'why do you feel this way?' or 'what can I do to improve this?' Instead, use the identified 'weaker' areas as a theme, and then ask them more specific questions, like how they'd feel if you changed a marketing tactic, or the sales process.
React properly
Now, I'll admit that this can be the hardest part. No one likes criticism. And it can hurt to hear that your team doesn't like something that you've been doing, even if it's totally innocuous like playing your music a little loud. When you ask for people to review you, you need to treat the process like you would as any other employee going through a performance review. Understand that the point of this exercise is for your staff to pick apart what you've been doing. If they don't have anything to say other than 'great job,' then there's a problem. Asking your employees for a review is an amazing opportunity for you to grow as a leader and manager. Just keep an open mind, write down any feedback, and be willing to change.

Good Climate Policy Is Good for Economic Growthreddit
After my first smoggy afternoon in New Delhi last week, I yearned for the preternaturally blue skies we had enjoyed in Beijing a few days earlier.
During a trip to China and India to learn about the growing market for clean technology in Asia, I had the opportunity to join leaders from civil society in New Delhi for the fifth in a series of “Track II” discussions between India and the United States on climate change and energy, organized by the Aspen Institute and the Ananta Center in India. On our final day in Delhi, Carol Browner, the dialogue's co-Chair and former EPA Administrator announced the news from East Asia, where Presidents Xi Jinping and Barack Obama had reached a bilateral agreement to fight climate change.
Around the table in New Delhi, the group began speculating about the implications for India. Would India now be expected to announce its own peak emissions year? Would the United States now redirect its "crosshairs" from China to India in upcoming UN negotiations? Could India's economy cope with more aggressive climate change mitigation?
The questions belied a deeper fear that India would be forced to forego economic growth to help clean up a global crisis that the West created.
While the desire to assign blame is understandable, climate mitigation need not mean economic doom. In fact, China's commitment showed the opposite: a strong economy and meaningful environmental policy are not mutually exclusive; one cannot be had without the other.
For me, an American traveling through Asia, the too often-invisible externalities of carbon-based economies were on full display.
During the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting that brought Obama to China, Beijing partially shut down one of the world's major economic centers in an effort to temporarily improve air quality. Industry was turned off, thousands of workers sent home and half the city's cars banned from the roads. The skies were "APEC Blue."
In Delhi, air quality has deteriorated over the last decade, too. Elsewhere in India, climate change doomsday scenarios have begun playing out: rising oceans encroach on crops; changing ecosystems force tigers into cities; and drought threatens India's national parks.
But a growing economy and rising sea levels don't have to coincide. Indeed, we now know they are antagonistic. What good is a commercial business district if all the workers have fled in search of breathable air? Or a farm without fresh water?
The U.S-China announcement reflects a dawning understanding that fighting climate change is good business.
From a selfish perspective, this understanding allows firms like Opower to go to Asia and sell clean energy technology. In India, where national missions to develop solar resources and energy efficiency are already in place, investors have led record growth in clean energy generation. Taken together, India's domestic leadership and the new China-U.S. climate deal provides more certainty and predictability to a market that has only recently solidified its footing in the mainstream economy. As more businesses come to the table in support of clean energy development, a model for clean economic growth can become a reality.
We may look back on the Chinese and American announcement as the first crack in the theory that an industrializing economy needs cheap, dirty fuel to propel its growth. Development need not go hand-in-hand with air pollution, traffic, and health risks that ultimately inhibit productivity and competitiveness.
On the eve of our New Delhi Dialogue, we visited Humayun's Tomb in central Delhi. As the sun lowered over the city, the light refracted through the smog giving off a gorgeous red glow. The light illuminated a majestic grave built more than four centuries ago. Mary Nichols, Chair of the California Air Resources Board, recalled similar sunsets over Los Angeles forty years ago. She assured us she didn't miss them.

Top 3 Trends in the Collaborative Enterprise for 2015reddit
Communication and employee engagement in the corporate enterprise is broken and has been for a long time.
The truth is, most people still work like its 1995. Everyone's locked in departmental silos and no one communicates or shares information with each other. Existing tools like legacy enterprise systems and email are failing.
The good news is that a ton of innovation is about to hit the enterprise front and center. The enterprise if ripe for innovation and there's huge profit opportunity here too - the Enterprise Collaboration Market in North America alone is expected to reach $34.74 billion by 2019 .
Add the Facebook At Work secret project to Cicso's Project Squared to IBMs new mail platform IBM Verse to Igloo Software, Jive, and Share Point, etc. and you can see how the space is growing. Fingers crossed that all this innovation will bring solutions that really solve problems going forward.
Good thing, too, because the millennial BYOD (bring-your-own-device) generation is getting impatient. Here's the trends to watch in 2015:
1. SMAC - the convergence of social, mobile, analytics, and cloud. None of this would be possible without each one of these technologies coming together. One IBM executive told me that their new IBM Verse product will "help companies go social without even knowing it." In other words, integrate  what's useful from social platforms and leave behind the angst of 'going social'.
2. Workplace transformation. The boomers are aging out and their way of working is going with them.  Here come the millennials in droves.  They have a totally new approach to solving problems.  Just take Slack , as an example.   "Slack is so beloved that some companies have begun mentioning it as an employment perk alongside on-site massages and bottomless bacon-tray Fridays in their job listings," says a recent profile of the company in Wired.
3. Unlocking Internal Intelligence. Companies that are already experimenting with collaboration are pleased with the results.  Employee engagement increases and companies are realizing that their brand must resonate internally as well as externally to attract and retain the talent needed to go forward.
In 2015 the workplace that is built to support interaction, collaborative working, creativity, innovation, flexibility and mentorship will THRIVE.  Your company has a choice: Ignore the trend or embrace the trend.

Are CEO s Too Burned Out to Thinkreddit
Well, now that's a scary thought coming from the CEO of an immense global organization, especially one that manufactures products in which safety is paramount.
A bit of context: this quote comes from a Bloomberg article that describes the hyper-scheduled lives of today's global CEO's. The piece describes fatigued executives, traveling as many as 20 days a month, crisscrossing the globe to woo investors, cheer on employees and hobnob with clients. Some opt out due to illness, others just say "enough" and move on. In the quote above, Marchionne, who was a philosophy major as a student, bemoans the lack of time for true reflection and stillness in a CEO's hectic life.
Still others thrive on the pace and have successfully developed coping mechanisms to stave off illness and burnout. They say that's the life of a CEO who runs a global operation, take it or leave it. But their numbers pale in comparison to the many who struggle to maintain the pace.
What's most troubling to me about this article is the pervasive sentiment that "this is the way it has to be."  Michael Useem, director of the Center for Leadership and Change Management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, is quoted in the piece, saying, "The best way any CEO can explain his or her company's strategy, values and the jobs people need to perform is to be in the room, in front of a lot of employees or other constituents. Nothing works as well as that personal presence, despite the personal toll that can take."
I'm not convinced by this argument. Is "in person" highly desirable? Yes. Is it imperative for every single meeting? No. Many of these CEO's came of age in a day when hopping on a plane was simply what was done - there was no way to get a "visual" read on the audience, so a business trip was essential. In their estimation, the best way to get the job done was to hop on a plane and meet eyeball-to-eyeball.
Or is it? There are technologies available that can put key leaders into situations that create connections, without physically being in the room. Even if CEO's dialed back by 20 percent on their in-person meeting attendance, that would keep them at their home base an extra 4 days a months. That's nearly an extra work week. I know of several executives who lead global teams and make regular use of webcams and other forms of technology to keep them connected to their teams. Do these modern-ay leaders still get on a plane and interact with their colleagues face-to-face? Of course, but they see in-person meetings as one tool in a larger toolbox for communicating with key constituents.
Look, I get it: CEO's of large companies are compensated handsomely and most of them travel in style. We "regular folks" probably aren't going to be too sympathetic to their plight. Most likely, people would say the exorbitant salaries many CEO's command compensates for the grueling pace. But if I worked for a company where I thought my CEO didn't even have "time to think," I'd be pretty nervous about the direction of the enterprise. It might not hurt to rethink the whole, "Our CEO needs to be everywhere to do the deal" mentality. Do you really want a burned out executive running your company?
What's your take on this? Do CEO's have an outdated mindset on corporate travel? Or is this the "new normal"?

20 Qualities of the Generous Leaderreddit
From a speech given at The Mindful Leadership Summit,  Washington D.C. November 14-16, 2014
I have been extraordinarily lucky in both my professional and personal lives to have met and worked closely with some remarkably generous leaders who have served as models of great inspiration for me. And, although I would never have thought so at the time, I have been equally fortunate to have learned almost as much from the very ungenerous. I'm sure we all have known such leaders -- immersed in the study of management; familiar with every new book and case study from The Harvard Business School; able to establish model strategies and processes. The "bottom lines" of their institutions might even be enviable. But as true leaders? I wouldn't follow them anywhere. The institutional cultures they create as well as their relationships with co-workers and colleagues are nearly devoid of generosity of spirit. So, in a very non-traditional way, they too can be superb teachers!
Five years ago, after a career devoted to nonprofit management, fundraising and philanthropy I began to immerse myself in the study of generosity -- what it is, what it isn't, how it manifests and how it changes lives. The result of those years is my book Inspiring Generosity (Wisdom Publications) that was published in February. While the research and writing of the book was a great learning experience, going around the country meeting and speaking with people who want to come together for conversations about generosity has certainly been at least as important to me.
I had three goals when I embarked upon the book. First, I believe in the power of inspiration and I believe that true generosity is powerfully inspiring. Second, I wanted to expand our understanding of generosity beyond the simple giving of money and material goods to something much more meaningful. What I am most interested in is what makes a generous life. And finally, I was interested in what generosity looks like on the ground in our day-to-day lives, not simply in the press's fascination with the activities of our philanthropic billionaires.
All three motives are equally alive for me today as I consider the nature of the generous leader. We all have many ways in which generosity shows up in our lives. I have found that people are often quite surprised and fascinated by exploring the ways in which generosity manifests that are above and beyond our usual understanding of the word. For example, I believe that expressing gratitude is an act of generosity. Likewise, expressing appreciation. Patience often requires generosity to ourselves and others. Deep listening is an act of generosity. And the list goes on.
The subject of generosity in business is often dismissed as impractical, pie in the sky, impossibly idealistic. I argue quite the opposite. Generosity is most certainly a virtue. But it also makes life better, makes people happier, enhances outcomes and inspires. It is not just for after hours. As Adam Grant has shown in his wonderful book Give and Take, generous people become successful and not, as we are accustomed to thinking, the other way around. He argues that success is not just about talent and hard work "... but about how we interact. It is in helping that givers succeed."
So now let's try out a few specific qualities of the generous leader. Actually more than a few. I'd like to propose 20, but there are at least another 20 for future consideration. These are not in any hierarchical order of importance.
1. The generous leader is open to all ideas of her colleagues, even those she does not particularly take to right off the bat. Of course there are bushels of bad ideas in each of our organizations. You would probably agree that some of our organizations even seem to specialize in bad ideas. But the generous leader opens herself to hearing and acknowledging before dismissing and diminishing. And the mere act of being open in turns helps foster institutional cultures of daring and boldness, unhampered by fears of put downs.
2. The generous leader gives the credit away because she understands the value of creating a sense of shared success and community. She sees utterly no advantage in grabbing the credit and embodies giving away the credit as a hallmark of her leadership.
3. The generous leader does not tolerate an organizational culture of blaming. In these highly insidious cultures it is so easy for blaming to become contagious and utterly decimate morale. The generous leader doesn't let it happen.
4. The flip side to not tolerating blame is fostering cultures of gratitude and appreciation. Studies show that gratitude is less likely to be expressed in the workplace than anywhere else. Grateful and appreciative leaders are always on the lookout for occasions to praise, to note the smallest accomplishment, and to encourage. As you might well imagine, quality and excellence are often the result.
5. Hand in hand with appreciation are kindness and care. Again, two "soft" qualities -- that is, until you see them in action in highly effective cultures. As it is nearly impossible to effectively introduce a culture of kindness at the bottom rungs of an unkind culture it is the generous leader who needs to model this form of generosity to employees and colleagues from the top.
6. Generous leaders celebrate small successes knowing that a generous culture of celebration renews mission and fosters community. It's also just a lot more fun to work with the celebrators.
7. While we might think that humility is an anomaly in successful business cultures, let's remember that Good to Great author Jim Collins calls it the #1 trait of a great leader. But it's not enough to just sound and look humble. This one has to come from deep inside and be what sets the compass. I contend that generosity of spirit is the driving engine of humility.
8. I believe that trusting one's colleagues is an act of generosity. But we can't summon up trust out of the blue. Organizational leadership needs to strongly signal that trust is the order of the day.  Warren Buffet has said that trust is one of the most powerful forces in an organization; "Find trustworthy managers and give them enormous amounts of leeway". I should add that ungenerous leaders I have known have been almost invariably unable to trust, even when they are at the helm of organizations in which trust is wholly warranted. Ironically, their inability to trust made them perceived as untrustworthy.
9. Leaders are not generally known, as a group, for their patience. We tend to equate patience with a tolerance for slowness. Instead, I see patience as correlating highly with trust. The patient leader has carefully assessed a situation and entrusted colleagues to work diligently to a successful outcome. The generous gift in that moment of trust is the patience to let the work unfold as it needs to in trusted hands. Usually the combination of trust and patience are rewarded with high levels of motivation, energy and determination.
10. The generous leader understands and cares deeply about creating and fostering a work environment conducive to energy, inspiration, vitality, collegiality and excellence. You can recognize these environments the moment you step in the door. Aesthetics matter. Individual workspaces are comfortable and pleasing to the eye. There is often art. Something is green, alive and growing. There is a sense of coherence. The atmosphere is not fraught and frenzied, though the work itself might be intense and fast paced. There might even be a dog. I am not arguing that everyone needs to be in yoga clothes with a cot for power napping, but environment matters and generous leaders know that and care.
11. Similarly, these cultures do not promote exhaustion. Why has it become such a badge of honor in our work life to say how busy we are? How often do we greet a colleague and just very informally say "Hi, how are you?" and the answer is one word: "Busy." Really? Busy is how we are? We are all in fact busy but is that what leads the list? And far too often the answer is "exhausted". Too many answers of "exhausted" creates a very slippery slope. I believe that some very well meaning leaders who are devoted to their work can inadvertently create whole organizational cultures of exhaustion where there is an undeclared prize for staying late, coming in before anyone else, answering emails in the middle of the night, and working through weekends. Where do batteries get recharged? How can innovation take place here? The generous leader gets it.
12. The ability to hold sacrifice as a key value is integral to generous leadership. Here I'm not talking about martyrdom or victimhood. But a generous leader puts the welfare of her employees and constituents first. I highly recommend to you the wonderful book Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek. He sums up his thesis as follows: Leaders "...are often willing to sacrifice their own comforts for ours, even when they disagree with us... Trust is a biological reaction to the belief that someone has our well being at heart. Leaders are the ones who are willing to give up something of their own for us... to put themselves at personal risk to open a path for others to follow."
13. Generous leaders do not hold grudges. It is the very opposite of generosity. Grudges hurt the team and the culture. They can decimate morale. Grudges emit destructive energy. Generous leaders choose to move on.
14. Related to but distinct from not holding a grudge is the ability to forgive. I'm not advocating amnesia, but the leader who can call a valued employee's honest mistake for what it is, understand it, work with it and move on has done herself and her organization a generous favor. Of course it isn't always either wise or possible but when it is, everybody wins.
15. Here is where I may lose you. I believe that we can help create generous organizational cultures, and I've seen leaders take the lead in this, by making them Gossip Free Zones. I know that here I risk sounding like a total Polyanna who has never set foot in a high-powered organization but I believe this one wholeheartedly. If nothing else, do you know how much time gossip about who is doing what to whom takes up in our days? I never really realized this until I became a consultant. Working for myself and largely divorced from talk around the water cooler, I can now see how many working hours can be gobbled up by negative energy. This is a tough one but there are rewards in just beginning and the best teacher is mindfulness practice.
16.  While leadership does not bring with it excessive amounts of free time, I am always heartened to see that the generous leader has found time to mentor, and not just within her own organization but for others. Perhaps it is my age speaking here but giving to the next professional generation is one of the great joys of this stage of my career. All of us who have been successful owe it to our younger colleagues to share what we know. Mentoring in our professional lives is a gift to the younger person, the profession and to ourselves.
17. Generous cultures value honest, respectful feedback. This is not just good business advice. It is actually generous to learn how to respond honestly, openly, kindly and at the right time. Even when the news is not what they would want to hear it is generous to make it helpful. I have been amazed at the number of times over the years that employees that I have actually had to fire have come back to me, often many years later, to thank me for what they learned in that otherwise very uncomfortable conversation.
18. This one is from my own highly unscientific and totally personal sampling. I have found that when I hear the generous leader speak about her organization or company, she almost never uses the possessive adjective "my". She does not speak of "my" board, "my" vice president, "my" curator, or "my" successful outcome. She genuinely feels part of the whole, feels that despite her lofty position, none of it is "hers". This one, by the way, only works when it is genuine. It can't be forced.
19. I can't believe that I'm making this #19 as I really believe that this one is paramount. But I told you no hierarchical order. #19 is LISTEN. And not just listen, but stop and listen. I have felt for a long time that real listening, total attention, what Adam Grant calls "powerless communication" is a powerful force. I believe that the best, most generous leaders are great listeners. Why is it then that much of what we teach in leadership is how to talk, how to take hold of the microphone, make our point, be forceful, and dominate? I believe there is untapped power in real listening that is really nothing more than generous communication between individuals and groups.
20. The generous leader works hard to keep her batteries continually charged. She avoids burnout for her own sake and the sake of others. She gives herself the gift of inspiration. I don't care if it is CrossFit or poetry; yoga or opera, meditation or mountain climbing. It is a generous gift to herself that makes her better at what she does. Daily seeds of inspiration are a gift to any leader and everyone she leads.
I'm sure many of you know the famous quote from Antoine de St. Exupery that can keep us all inspired and generous leaders: "If you want to build a ship, don't herd people together to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea."

The Great Transformation of the Organization Needs the Howreddit
Billed as "The Great Transformation", its work was cut out for itself from the moment you could register online. A conference paying homage to the brilliance of Peter Drucker has now become an annual calendar fixture not to be missed. The 6th iteration of the Global Peter Drucker Forum -- recently held in Vienna, naturally -- has arguably become the TED or Davos of all leadership conferences. But could we shift into an era of "managing our way to prosperity," as the conference sub-title suggested?
Could we achieve "The Great Transformation"?
Richard Straub, the Forum's chief architect, asked a rhetorical question in his opening remarks to the Forum, "Have we reached a turning point?" The 'we' he referred to might have been leaders in today's organizations. I reckon you could argue it was 'society' in general that needed an autopsy on turning points. Either way, I sat at my seat, took another look at magnificent mural on the ceiling, and answered the question Richard posed to myself.
No.
We haven't reached a turning point. At least not yet.
We've reached a crisis point.
Think of it as if you were a member of the G7, trying to sort out what to do about Russia, Vladimir Putin and the ongoing saga that is the Ukraine.
Richard went on to suggest Peter Drucker himself would have categorically stated that, "Management has a key role to play in this transformation." Hard to disagree with Richard on that point, however, data suggests management remains ambivalent if not clueless to key transformative opportunities. Concepts such as maximizing shareholder value as the singular measure of success, bureaucracy and command and control tactics as the basis for organizational culture and leadership, amongst various human resources inanities that make it difficult to ever feel engaged at work are as prevalent today as traffic congestion on Silicon Valley's Highway 101 will be decades from now.
Management is the problem. The crisis, ergo, is management.
If we are to reach a transformative "turning point" there would have been many more participants than the 2500 combined in-person and online attendees taking part in this year's conference. This is not to take anything away from Richard or conference attendees -- for these folks are the true trailblazers of organizational change -- but if we are to see a great transformation in our lifetime, the Global Peter Drucker Forum ought to become the vehicle for the turning point itself. And we need more people involved to achieve that type of mission. Quite frankly, the conference should have attracted more than a football stadium full of leaders who want to see such a transformation.
"I wish us all an inspiring conference," Richard gleefully uttered as he concluded his opening remarks. Indeed, it was an inspiring conference ... but by the end of the two days it became a stark reminder of how far society needs to venture if we are to truly aspire to a "great transformation."
Adi Ignateus, Editor-in-Chief of Harvard Business Review, stepped to the microphone looking joyful if not hopeful and bellowed,
"Our starting point is that things are not ok. Debt levels are high, respect for institutions is low, equality is suspect, and we can't beat the stranglehold of short-term thinking."
I wanted to give him an affectionate, Canadian polar bear hug -- mostly because I've been banging on my drum about his opening statement for years -- but I ran out of time because walking up on stage to deliver their opening morning keynotes were Pele, Maradona and Sir Bobby Charlton.
No, not really.
But would you believe the opening act included Clay Christensen, Gary Hamel and Roger Martin? This conference was about to get epic. What a triple-play bill of thought leaders to begin with.
The question this trio was tasked to answer was, "Is management up to today's challenge?"
Renown Harvard Business School professor, Clay Christensen , -- he of the disruption theory and accompanying models -- claimed that growth comes from innovation and the link between growth and innovation is investment. Clay suggested there are three types of innovation:
Market creating innovations (only the rich have access to it) e.g. the computer. It's the source of all corporate and national growth. The kind of innovations that allow access to more people and services.
Sustaining innovations - most of what we see today are sustaining innovations, he said. It helps an organization's margins improve because they make markets vibrant. They don't create growth, per se. These innovations are important but they are replicative.
Efficiency innovations - helps an organization get lean. If the firm doesn't get more efficient, they get kicked out of the game sooner. It's when an organization seeks to "do more with less" as an innovation strategy.
When I heard Clay gracefully and calmly explain the "efficiency innovation" example -- using the term "do more with less" -- I immediately felt my body go into uncontrollable spasms, reminded of the far-too-frequent number of times I've heard that soul-sucking phrase in my various workplace dealings. I always thought it was a practical joke of CFO's to wax lyrical about doing more with less.
Where I felt Clay answered the question most effectively, however, was when he launched into a finance lesson on numerators and denominators. "Prior to 1980, measures of success were based on whole numbers," he remarked. "For example, dollars were used as the measurement." Now that made sense.
But Clay went on to outline something I hadn't thought of before.
"Finance has now given us measures to view how successful we are with capital. These are measures of how efficiently we are using capital. They are ratios and as we know, ratios have a numerator and a denominator."
Although Clay didn't come right out and say leaders need to revert back to reporting on and setting whole numbers as financial targets, he did crystalize the fact that there are now two levers to tweak so an organization can improve growth. Actually, it's been going on for well over 30 years. This, in part, provided me with an answer to the question, "why have our organizations stagnated?" If an organization wants to become more innovative, what they're really playing around with isn't innovation itself, but ratios of capital.
This can't be good. If an organization truly wanted to be innovative, it would invest in the numerator but if that proved too hard -- if IRR (internal rates of return) were too low or too slow to achieve -- the Finance and/or C-Suite could simply reduce the denominator on the capital ratio. It's obvious to me far too many firms are taking the easy way out and shirking their innovation responsibilities by nudging the denominator versus the numerator. Clay said as much by claiming capital has now become abundant and cheap, yet organizations husband it. He believes we're going in the wrong direction and I couldn't agree more. Innovation and thus investment in the numerator is required. We need to refrain from the fixation on share buybacks, and use the capital (i.e. the profit) to invest back in the numerator. Great strategy from Clay, arguably the world's smartest thinker according to Thinkers 50.
"We stand on the shoulders of others," exclaimed another management guru Gary Hamel , as he took the stage in what can only be described as a frenetic delivery style, compared to Christensen at least. With the audience half-scared he might venture off the stage to deliver head-butts, he continued,
"How can we build organizations that are adaptable at its core?"
Gary answered his own question right out of the blocks. "Organizations aren't up to the challenge," he yelled. (Seriously, he yelled.)
I was scared.
"If the organization wants to survive, they have to transform themselves," he continued. Ok, I'm with you Gary ... but what's your strategy for change?
He attempted to answer the rhetorical question I asked myself. Gary believes salvation and prosperity (there's that word again) can be had if the goal of organizations becomes the process in which they can become a self-renewing organization. This happens by innovation which, as he stated, "is the fuel for renewal."
He outlined three approaches (they were questions in all honesty) to build a self-renewing organization:
How have employees been trained as a business investor?
If an employee has an idea, how can they get capital to launch it?
Is the organization measuring the investment/idea and attaching it back to compensation and other targets?
It's hard to argue with Gary's ideas, but three things donned on me when he concluded.
First, he's loud.
Second, the culture within many organizations is far too closed and hierarchical as it stands today, therefore the steps outlined above will never occur unless it's fixed.
Third, as Christensen pointed out, it's far too easy for an organization to impose a "do more with less" mantra and to then fiddle with the denominator than it is to make innovation investments with the numerator. So in reality, this has to be fixed first -- alongside the culture of an organization -- before we can achieve the status of a self-renewing organization that he purports.
Gary is an enthusiastic speaker, replete with plenty of Tweetable catch-phrases -- e.g. Management is the love child of Julius Caesar and Frederic Winslow Taylor by introducing command and control tactics and industrial engineering to organizations -- but I'm not entirely convinced he effectively answered the question, "Is management up to today's challenge?"
The final opening act soccer star (err, speaker) was fellow Canadian, Roger L. Martin , Academic Director of the Martin Prosperity (there's that word again) Institute out of the Rotman School of Business in Toronto. Truth be told, I've always been a fan of Roger's work. He long has railed against the "game" that has been played by publicly traded companies, analysts, hedge funds, pension corporations and the stock market. He, like me, yearns to bring balance to our organizations such that there may be a better sense of equilibrium between purpose and profit.
His talk, as I had hoped, delivered on multiple levels. Speaking on the "Structure of Democratic Capitalist Infrastructure" and how it has become what he calls "perverted", Roger explained to a captivated audience that "patent trolls" exist solely to make money and they do so by raping and pillaging companies that want to use the technology for good. You should tweet that sentence. With this inexcusable mindset in play, the infrastructure inside our organizations is set to be far too narrow, thus basing its interests on short termism type actions.
As I am an opponent of maximizing shareholder value as the sole means to measure a business, Roger deftly argued (and phew, agrees with me) that this sort of deplorable corporate robbing creates stagnation, a lack of innovation, and a skewing of what the true purpose of an organization really should be. It was fun to watch Clay Christensen walk off of the stage where he was seated so he could have a better view of Roger's graphs and charts, which spoke volumes to Roger's overarching thesis.
Notable comments from Roger throughout the conference included how:
"we've structured the corporate world in a way that facilitates the operation of bandits,"
and
"the highest rewards in today's economy go to people who trade value, and not to the people who create value."
As usual, Roger nailed it. (#mancrush)
The Global Peter Drucker Forum was two hours into its journey but, with a tear in my eye, I was becoming more depressed by the second. The talks to this point were splendid but the recipe for change -- the master playbook for "The Great Transformation" -- seemed complex and beyond our reach. Were my expectations off kilter? Or, perhaps, I was correct in asserting we were not at a turning point, but at a continued state of crisis.
The speakers continued throughout day one. Each took a turn identifying the problem, and for some, taking a crack at a solution.
Rick Goings , CEO of Tupperware, told us that:
"leaders are about the sustainability of the organization and that innovation is one of the tools at their disposal."
More importantly, he felt leadership "is not just to build companies, but to create opportunities for all." Alright, no disagreement from me on that point, but where's the how? Nancy Tennant , Vice-President of Innovation at Whirlpool Corporation suggested for an organization to become innovative -- like what they allegedly accomplished at Whirlpool -- they should define what innovation is to the firm, train employees on that definition, and then watch how innovation will become an operating norm. Ok, I'll buy that. Vineet Nayer, the former CEO of HCL -- a company and leader I profiled in FLAT ARMY -- stated the turnaround at HCL was due, in part, to a democratization of innovation where ideas were allowed to surface from anywhere, and decisions were made across any level." He believed that an organization's competitive advantage lies in "putting employees first, and customers second." I've read the book , so if you're looking for the 'how', there are some good examples you might want to investigate.
Would an economist have better luck answering our question? Martin Wolf , Associate Editor and Chief Economics Commentator at the Financial Times, gave it his best shot suggesting no one individual should be allowed to own a company. "No one can own a country," Wolf further stated, "so the claim that shareholders should have absolute control of the company is false." I liked where he was going. It reminded me of the work another economist -- Bill Lazonick -- had put forward recently on Harvard Business Review. The real answer began to surface from him when he said, "If management is to use its position to benefit the company and society, it needs the best arrangement in which to do so." His answer?
"The company should be seen as a semi-permanent institution and philosophically it should be set up much like a trustee relationship."
Bingo! Wolf had set the table (it felt like a feast) and highlighted a possible answer to our vexing question. Perhaps Wolf was suggesting companies re-establish themselves as B-Corps, (I wrote about B-Corps on Huffington Post ) otherwise known as Benefits Corporations? I'd be all for that idea.
Pankaj Ghemawat , a professor at NYU laid part of the blame on today's business schools. He said, "Irrespective, there is an error of omission in business school education today without being exposed to market failures." So, in part, an answer can come from the redevelopment of business school education such that market failures are addressed. I'll agree to that, however, business schools need to take a long, hard look at what they're teaching and (perhaps) think about a more balanced view of purpose with profit. (I have more to say on this when we make a spectacular announcement in January)
In his usual thoughtful and cerebrally controversial way, John Hagel -- Co-Chair of the Deloitte Center for the Edge -- claimed most companies are an unnatural bundle of three business types:
Infrastructure management business - high volume e.g. call center
Product innovation and commercialized - e.g. iPad
Customer relationship business - knowing customers better, and helping them more
He reminded us that Peter Drucker once wrote that the role of a CEO is to answer the questions, "what is our business, what should be our business, and what shouldn't it be." Hagel wondered aloud if the organization is to keep all three types of business types alive, the end game of the firm will undoubtedly be compromised. Notably, John indicated between 1965 and present day, ROA (return on assets) has collapsed by 79%, attributing the decrease to a fixation on non-scalable institutions (i.e. the fixation on all three types of business models he defined) as opposed to implementing his answer, the scalable learning organization.
By the end of Day One, it was clear to me many smart people have thought an awful lot about the current crisis. Each had provided a wonderful snapshot explaining "what" was wrong but I still was missing the unified "how is this going to get fixed" answer.
Was there a unified answer out there?
Day two, thankfully, saw the inclusion of several more women delivering talks and panel discussions. Day one was heavily skewed toward the male gender. There were three talks in particular that I found further defined our current crisis, that also provided a glimpse into how our organizations might be fixed.
Rita Gunther McGrath , a professor at Columbia Business School, delivered a delightful talk suggesting "intelligent failures" need to become more common in today's organizations. "You had a plan, you tested it, you knew what went wrong, you shared messages of failure, you learned from it, and you innovated again," was how Rita explained the concept. My take from Rita's talk was organizations need to be resilient and flexible -- while not only being a learning organization -- agreeing to gather and disseminate the tuition value from mistakes.
Nilofer Merchant, entrepreneur extraordinaire, took the conch and wonderfully hammered home the point that social is not a technology, it is a behaviour. (She actually stopped her talk mid-keynote and asked us to get social with someone beside us) Her point? The more people are allowed (and encouraged) to connect and collaborate, the greater payoff your organization will have downstream. I loved Nilofer's message in addition to her delivery style, something I hadn't yet experienced face-to-face. (If you haven't watched her TED Talk , please do so. It's a gem.)
Herminia Ibarra , a professor from Insead, gave incredible insight into the nuances of different types of leaders. From heroic, to charismatic, to visible, to individualistic, to peacetime/wartime, to collaborative, Herminia's examples were insightful, funny and painful for their accuracy. I've always appreciated her work and the connections she makes between effective (and ineffective) leadership and the crisis we find ourselves in today's organizations.
In the lead up to this year's conference, I was asked by Steve Denning , author of Radical Management and one of the coolest provocateurs out there, if I wanted to a) speak at the conference as part of the track he was chairing and b) if I would work with him on a position paper outlining the hopes and dreams for the Drucker Forum itself.
I delivered a talk on day two, focusing my message on three key parts.
First, there is causality between an engaged organization and much improved business metrics.
Second, FLAT ARMY is a "how to" manual for organizations to achieve the open operating culture that can mitigate the issues found in today's organizations.
And third, I used the platform to explain how a corporate culture change at TELUS (my place of work since 2008) helped to increase employee engagement from 53% to 83% while improving countless business metrics in parallel.
The bottom line? If you create an inspired, empowered, authentic and collaborative organization, an innovative, customers first output will be the result. This leads to what so many organizations yearn for ... improved business AND non-business results.
The paper we worked on (with Bill Fisher, Haydn Christensen and Nick Dixson) was posted to Forbes before the conference began, and in it, we posed three questions:
Should firms make the shift from the goal of maximizing shareholder value as measured by the current stock price to a principal focus on adding value to those for whom the work is being done?
Should organizations make the shift from the practices of hierarchical bureaucracy to the collaborative leadership and management practices of the Creative Economy?
Should organizations make a shift from metrics that reflect narrow financial goals to metrics that reflect contributions to prosperity of individuals, organizations and society, for achieving both purpose and profit?
Whilst the aforementioned questions were not answered at the Drucker Forum outright, I left thinking I wasn't alone. From the various speakers, to the attendees I spoke with, to several meaningful and deep conversations, -- it's evident everyone is (for the most part) on the same page. We may not be at a turning point but we're all acutely aware of the crisis we've gotten ourselves into. The questions found above were met with unanimous agreement from a Drucker Forum choir of voices that sang, "but of course, we need to change" in collective harmony. Given we were in Vienna, it was fitting.
We left the conference with an agreement on the 'what'. Phew. Now we need action on the 'how'. And we need it ASAP.
As Clay Christensen remarked in the closing comments to the conference,
"Let's take the best of each other's ideas and languages, -- our ways of communicating -- share, focus and then standardize to make change."
Hallelujah. That sounded like a mission to prosperity indeed.
(There's that word again, only this time there were violas playing.)

Are You the Average Thanksgiving Consumerreddit
Thanksgiving is about a week away. This is the holiday when people get excited at the prospect of eating a chicken that gets stuffed into a duck, which then gets stuffed into a turkey . This is also the holiday when people stab and shoot each other when they can't get what they want to buy . So let's just all agree then that Thanksgiving is about consumption -in terms of food and in terms of buying things.  And consumption, particularly the latter kind, is fascinating to us at the Georgetown Institute for Consumer Research .  No surprise then that we see Thanksgiving as a fantastic opportunity to research consumer behavior.
Last year, we answered a few questions about Thanksgiving that you might have been curious about. For instance, about half of all consumers can't imagine Thanksgiving dinner without turkey. And a similar number reported that they planned to take a nap after Thanksgiving dinner, making it the most popular after-dinner activity. This year, we ran another survey and just published the results . Here are a few of the biggest findings from this year.
First, more and more people will be doing more and more of their shopping online. In fact, our survey showed that 83% of those who will be shopping will be shopping both online and in brick-and-mortar stores, and an additional 12% will be shopping only online. This trend toward shopping online is not surprising at all. One Black Friday experience a few years ago was all it took to convince me that the frenzy of shopping in stores was not for me, and it seems an increasing number of consumers are reaching the same conclusion.
On a related note, the terms "Black Friday" and "Cyber Monday" seem to be losing their meaning. It used to be that people shopped in stores on Friday and online on Monday. However, when we asked consumers when they planned to shop, they said they planned to do more shopping online than in stores on both days. In fact, more people planned to shop online on Black Friday than on Cyber Monday! Add to this that many online and brick-and-mortar retailers are planning to start Thanksgiving sales well before Friday, and it really doesn't seem that we're talking about any one particular day of shopping anymore. Black Friday is not just about Friday or about brick-and-mortar retailers anymore.
Another big finding was that electronics were no longer the most popular category of items that people planned to purchase. Rather, apparel beat out electronics to claim the top spot. This could be because there doesn't seem to be any flashy new tech gadget that everyone is lusting after this year. There's no new gaming console, new smartphone models have been out for a while, and there has been no major development in the world of televisions and computers. It's kinda boring in the electronics world this year.
In addition to asking people what they were planning to shop for, we also asked them where they planned to do their shopping. It turns out that a majority of consumers will be shopping at places they already frequent. Moreover, about a third will be shopping at places where they frequently shop just around the holidays. So consumers plan to shop at the retailers with whom they're already familiar. After all, when you're shopping for that perfect sweater, you don't want to be figuring out where the sweaters are going to be, how they're going to fit, and whether you'll find one in a style you like. You don't have time for all that! There's a turducken waiting!
So this Thanksgiving the average consumer will probably be shopping online on Friday for apparel items at retailers where they already shop frequently. Does that sound like you?

The Shift From Promotion to Pragmatism in Impact Investingreddit
I'm in the midst of an exciting and exhausting round on the conference circuit which has taken me across the continent and back. This week I'm in South Africa participating in Global Entrepreneurship Week festivities. Luckily, I have had plenty of reading material for the plane rides.
This fall, a number of impact finance publications have been released by groups such as the Global Development Incubator , the World Economic Forum (WEF), and the G7 which I think are propelling the impact investing sector forward--and moving beyond the initial overblown rhetoric about this sector as a cure-all for global social challenges.  Indeed, I've been impressed by the caliber of discussion and debate about impact investing--both on stage and in text.  We are evolving from premature promotion to informed implementation.
With an estimated global market size of less than $100 billion today--a miniscule portion of total global managed assets-- impact investing has a long way to go before it becomes mainstream . But, gone are the heady headlines proclaiming the birth of a trillion dollar asset class. Instead, we are seeing substantive attempts to overcome challenges to sector growth.
The WEF report subtitle is indicative: " How Mainstream Investors can Design Visionary and Pragmatic Impact Investing Strategies ." While the concept is visionary, the report focus is squarely on the pragmatism. The work outlines very specific tactics that different players interested in the impact investing field can use to expand their activities.
The G7 Social Investment Investing Task Force report presents a series of actionable recommendations for institutions, governments, and multi-lateral institutions to propel the growth of the sector. Given ANDE 's specific interest in emerging markets, we paid particularly close attention to the recommendations of the International Development Working Group, one of four subject matter groups that were convened.
Sonal Shah, the chair of the working group, launched its report at our annual conference last month. She surprised the audience with the specificity of the four report recommendations which included a call for a new G20-sponsored $500 million Impact Finance Facility to cultivate emerging companies and business models and the creation of new $100m fund to support Development Impact Bonds.
The recommendations were made with significant effort to reflect the reality of the marketplace today--and the great potential of tomorrow.  According to the report, the Impact Finance facility created the $500 million ticket size so that it "would be large enough to make a difference while being politically feasible...the size of the fund will ultimately be determined by public support for it."
This sort of refreshing realism was also evident earlier this fall at Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). In a discussion group about investing in emerging markets, leaders from the for-profit and non-profit sectors dug deep into the challenges of unlocking capital for early-stage impact enterprises.
These entrepreneurs--who are typically seeking investment or loans that are valued between $25,000 to $250,000--struggle mightily to raise start-up funds. So, the group explored a variety of solutions to this issue, with a particular focus on efforts that would reduce the due diligence costs of banks and investors. We discussed various models that aggregate information on firms' ability to repay; crowd-funding solutions; and tiered financing models that rely on making initial small investments with only minimal review. CGI is now reviewing suggestions on how to continue to use their platform to address and educate investors around this issue.
One way our network tried to solve the hurdle for start-up capital for early-stage entrepreneurs was to launch a finance challenge to encourage new models for deploying capital. One million euros was awarded last month to a Franco-African impact investment group that successfully ran a pilot program that can be scaled and replicated throughout the western part of the continent.
Even with the excitement surrounding impact investing, we're reminded "not to over promote the practice or fall victim to the notion that it represents some sort of panacea for the problems confronting us...," as Cathy Clark, Jed Emerson and Ben Thornley aptly write in their recently published book . While some of the loud buzz of impact investing is fading, the level of discourse is rising. We are moving ahead with better data, more serious discussions, and increasingly creative ideas to unlock the full power of market-based solutions to poverty.
So, while tired by the travel, I am pleased by the progress.

The Case for Privatizing Unemployment Insurancereddit
A new GOP majority will be looking for creative policy proposals to differentiate themselves from President Obama.  After years of being called a "do nothing" Congress, they are going to look at proposals that will help them differentiate themselves in a way that resonates with millions of voters of every economic group.
Several years ago President George W. Bush's attempted to privatize Social Security. This bold proposal fell upon deaf ears and was considered "dead on arrival" by policy wonks.  The reality is, a move to privatizing something as far reaching in importance as Social Security -- even only partially -- was more than most people could imagine. Is was too big and over reaching and sent shock waves among voters across the country. It became a lightning rod to many interest groups that have the protection of Social Security as it is, their single focus.
After a terrible unemployment experience over the last several years, with people receiving benefits for 24 months and only having the option of getting small payments when a larger influx of money could have made a difference in the creating of an actual business, I think many Americans would find serious unemployment reform, including privatization, attractive.
The number of people who will ever need unemployment insurance is considerably less than those who will need Social Security. Therefore it is "safer" to implement in this arena than in something like Social Security. In other words, it would be perceived as an experiment, rather than a radical shift in policy.
This policy could have substantial flexibility in plan design, allowing individuals to store up money for the purpose of creating a business at the event of unemployment. This is something many would find attractive and would easily build support.  This is particularly true after finding millions on unemployment for literally years.  With an approach like this, they could have created a business with their insurance proceeds.
Until 2008 and the years that immediately followed, we have enjoyed decades of relatively low unemployment, with short periods of higher unemployment. When you look at the mid 1980s until the 2008 crisis and following, you see an unemployment that justifies modest, market, rates.  These would be very attractive compared to the arbitrary government taxes, and would likely lead to a large number of Americans to support it.
With a huge number of Baby Boomers in or approaching retirement age (and many being vulnerable to being laid off), yet not having adequate savings, they would love to have a "tool" like this to protect them. This would create a huge amount of support and financial momentum.
The benefits of this policy would be numerous and obvious:
People would be able to design plans to meet their specific needs.
People would have an incentive to get back to work quicker (or to create a business), in order to keep their rates low. Over usage would lead to higher rates, similar to the way other insurance are determined. The benefits to the economy would be obvious.
It would contribute to a growing economy as revenues moved to private enterprise, both in premiums (which insurance companies would use for investments) and in the creation of new businesses because of the policy designs.
With the vast majority of Americans employed and many of them preferring to easily create a business if they lost their job, there should be plenty of support for a policy such as this. Furthermore, it could be a great wedge issue for the GOP to take support from the Democrats as they position themselves as a party that is concerned about average Americans. This isn't a policy that should have to wait for a Republican President AND Congress. Rather, it is an issue Republicans should pursue today and make it a referendum issue for 2016.

Challenging (Crude) Conventionreddit
Co-authored by Mark Lewis and by J. David Hughes
Media reports regarding the American crude oil industry have been uniformly positive in the past few months. Oil prices have dropped to their lowest level since 2010 and along with it prices at the pump. According to some reports, the US now produces as much or more oil than either Saudi Arabia or Russia. As the US closes in on energy independence, our reliance on foreign suppliers dwindles. Some suggest we are nearing a time of oil and economic security not seen in decades. If only that were true.
The above rendering of events is taken, almost without examination, as gospel truth in the United States.  The only subject of debate seems to be ascertaining whether hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") is safe for the environment of if burning the additional hydrocarbons is adding to risks of climate change .  We find this near-religious belief in looming US oil "independence" to be troubling, as a considerable body of publicly available information leads to a very different conclusion.
Instead of being on the dawn of a new age of plenty, a careful analysis of all available data indicates the probability of near to mid-term trouble even maintaining current levels of production, let alone eliminating the chasm between US production and consumption.
Many TV commentators and opinion leaders highlight the fact US domestic oil production has just eclipsed the Saudi Arabian and Russian behemoths.  What the sound bites fail to provide, however, is context.  According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the current daily production of crude oil and other liquids, Saudi Arabia produce 11.7 million barrels of oil per day (mbd), Russia 10.4 mbd, and the US at 11.1 mbd.  But the gross amount of oil each nation produces isn't what matters.  It's net oil.
The EIA also reports that Saudi Arabia consumes 2.9 mbd, leaving and estimated 8.6 mbd available for export. Russia consumes 3.3 mbd, leaving 7.2 mbd available for export. The US consumes , however, 18.9 mbd per day, leaving a deficit of 6.6 mbd that has to be met by importing foreign oil.  Russia and Saudi Arabia, therefore, remain securely in the global petroleum driver's seat while the US remains the globe's most vulnerable.  Unfortunately, that's not the only red warning flag.
An analysis of the US light tight oil (LTO) industry indicates that overall US production, according to the EIA , is expected to peak, possibly as soon as 2017-18, but likely no later than 2020-21, at which time overall US production begins an inexorable decline.  This conclusion is based on the results of an in-depth assessment of actual well production data from the major shale plays I (Hughes) conducted ( Drilling Deeper is the detailed, 315 page study).  The results of this analysis reveal:
- high-quality plays are not ubiquitous - nearly two-thirds of U.S. tight oil production comes from just two plays - the Bakken and Eagle Ford - and most production comes from relatively small "sweet spots" within these plays.
- production declines of wells are 80%-85% in the first 3 years meaning that 40%-45% of production must be replaced each year by more drilling to keep production flat.
- as sweet spots become saturated with wells, drilling must move into lower quality parts of these plays (which have the bulk of remaining drilling locations and average well production of half or less that of sweet spots), hastening the production falloff after peak.
- other plays have not been found that compare to the Bakken and Eagle Ford. Plays such as the Permian Basin, Niobrara and Austin Chalk represent redevelopments of existing plays with new fracking technology. We find the assessment by the US Department of Energy (DOE) that these plays will produce four to five times their historical production by 2040 to be optimistic in the extreme. Other emerging plays will produce additional tight oil but likely nothing comparable in scale to the Bakken or Eagle Ford.
- DOE forecasts a peak in U.S. tight oil in 2021 in its reference case , followed by a gradual decline.  But to meet even this forecast twice as much oil will have to be produced from other plays as is projected from the Bakken and Eagle Ford by 2040, which evidence suggests is unlikely to be realized.
Yet geological and technological factors aren't the only issues that pose constraints to future LTO production.   There is a growing capital-expenditure (capex) crisis in the upstream oil industry that raises serious concerns about not merely US production, but future global oil supplies.
The upstream oil industry's capital intensity has increased astronomically over the last decade owing to the massive annual investments now required in order to 1) replace declining output in ageing conventional fields, 2) counter the high decline rates in US shale-oil as explained above, and 3) produce ever increasing amounts of oil over and above replacement levels so as to meet growing global demand.
Capex data from the International Energy Data (IEA) published in last year's World Energy Outlook (WEO) and production data from the US Energy Information Administration show that from 2005 to 2013 global upstream capex increased by 100% (from $220bn to $440bn), but that over the same period the global oil supply increased by only 6% (5.4mbd).
Moreover, the rising costs associated with the industry's increasing capital intensity have run ahead of prices since 2011, and led to a fall in the oil majors' capital productivity and hence to cuts in their capex budgets since the beginning of this year. And yet despite these cutbacks, the IEA's World Energy Investment Outlook 2014 (WEO) published in June raised its estimate of required future upstream capex to meet global oil demand over the next two decades by $2 trillion.
In short, we think that US shale-oil production is likely to peak in 2017-18, and that the capex crisis of the oil majors is placing at risk its ability to meet future demand. It is imperative, then, that American policy makers and people recognize that the fracking-enabled spike in US crude oil production most likely represents only a temporary reprieve from the declining production levels experienced from 1970 to 2005. Heading into Thanksgiving weekend gasoline prices are expected to be at their lowest mark since 2009 .  The medium and long term indicators, as we've noted, indicate this drop will be a short reprieve before prices at the pump rise in tandem with increases in oil price.
Recognizing the US may have only a few more years of rising production levels and that even global supply is uncertain in the medium future, it would be prudent to begin more aggressively investing in creative new means of powering the economy.  That investment may be necessary, however, irrespective of when US LTO peaks.
In the latest report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), risks from the threat of climate change are growing.  The report concluded that, "Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems."  According to the New York Times , the US Administration is taking the matter seriously. "(T)he president's science adviser, John P. Holdren, calling [the IPCC report] 'yet another wake-up call to the global community that we must act together swiftly and aggressively in order to stem climate change and avoid its worst impacts."
Should the United States enter into a global agreement at the 2015 Paris UN Summit that results in a restriction on the burning of future petroleum products, the need to accelerate investment and research into alternative means of energy creation and usage will only increase. Thus, whether its to prepare for a drop in future oil supply or to mitigate the impact of climate change, the need is the same and pressing.  But there is more hope on that front than many realize.
The quality and efficiency of solar power and wind turbines continues to improve and we should encourage further development.  More aggressively investing might also be appropriate in conducting cutting edge research designed to replace the notoriously inefficient combustion engine with something far more efficient and less polluting.  Or even championing a drive to inspire and fund a generation of new inventors, charged with the objective of discovering and creating new ways to power road, rail, sea, and air transport which does not yet exist; to challenge our best, most creative minds to transcend the conventional means of fueling and empowering economies that have been little changed in the past century and discover new means for the next century.
Success with this kind of investment is not certain, and it will certainly entail failure, but we believe it unwise to continue following the status quo, without exploring innovative means of powering the economy.  In the face of mounting evidence the energy inputs necessary to power our economic system cannot be long sustained. Further, if our analysis is correct and the US makes no policy changes, the United States will soon begin steady decline in relative power to Russia and Saudi Arabia, as America's dependence on foreign oil climbs.  The time to mitigate or avoid that future outcome is to recognize the warning signs now and take prudent action.

(Adds Breakingviews link)
Nov 18 (Reuters) - A senior executive at U.S. ride-sharing  company Uber suggested that the company should spend a million  dollars to hire a team of opposition researchers to "dig up  dirt" on its critics in the media, BuzzFeed reported.
The comments, BuzzFeed said, came from Emil Michael, Uber's  senior vice president for business, during a private dinner in  New York last week. He later said he believed the conversation  was off the record, according to the social news and  entertainment website. (http://bzfd.it/1BJzYq5)
Over dinner, Michael outlined the notion of hiring a team  that could, he said, help Uber fight back against the press -  they'd look into "your personal lives, your families," and give  the media a taste of its own medicine, according to the BuzzFeed  article, written by Ben Smith, the site's editor-in-chief.
"The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne  out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is  sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to  work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation  to the company's views or approach," Michael said in a  statement.
Nairi Hourdajian, an Uber spokeswoman said: "We have not, do  not and will not investigate journalists. Those remarks have no  basis in the reality of our approach."
Companies such as Lyft, Sidecar and UberX, which is a part  of black-car service Uber, allow passengers to summon paid rides  using apps on their smartphones and have gained in popularity in  dozens of U.S. cities over the past few years.
But they face opposition from taxi companies that argue the  upstarts do not face the same stringent regulations as do  traditional cabs, and insurance companies want ride-sharing  drivers to carry more expensive insurance policies.

France investigates a secret tax that targets womenBy Rick Noack November 19 Follow @rick_n
One of the photos taken by women's rights activist Géraldine Franck shows price differences between deodorant sprays for men and women. (Photos by Géraldine Franck)
From disposable razors to chocolate, French women are being charged more than men for near-identical products, according to the French rights group Georgette Sand. The group has taken photographs at a variety of stores that appear to show different prices for similar types of products depending on the gender they are being marketed to.
The group calls it a secret "tax" on women. For example, according to photos posted by the group, women pay more for disposable razors sold in separately branded packaging.
A photo taken by activist Géraldine Franck shows price differences between razors for men and women.
And Ferrero chocolate — which sometimes features different packaging targeting girls and boys but is produced by the same company and sold in the same size — is shown to have two different prices depending on whom it is aimed at.

Georgette Sand's campaign has caught on quickly throughout France, a country that is known for its focus on equality and is ruled by the Socialist Party. More than 40,000 people have signed a petition , prompting the French Finance Ministry to announce an investigation.
Géraldine Franck, one of activists behind the campaign, told The Washington Post that the French government needs to take action. "Gendered sections in supermarkets need to be eliminated. And if that turns out to be impossible, the minimum that needs to be done is an equalization of prices," Franck said.
Public anger has particularly focused on a supermarket chain called Monoprix, which — ironically — can be translated as "Single price." However, Monoprix is far from the only store that charges women extra. "We knew we would find differences, but not as quickly as we ended up doing," Franck  told the newspaper Le Parisien. She said that within three hours of walking around her city district, she found 15 instances of price differences worth photographing.
Monoprix has defended the tactic by pointing to economic factors. "The larger sale, in volume, of men’s razors allows for a lower retail price," the company said, according to France24 . The retailer also stated that women’s razors were more expensive to produce, but it did not provide any details.
In response to the public outcry, some French media outlets are pointing at the United States as a role model. In 1995, California  signed a bill that banned gender discrimination in pricing, and many states have since followed suit. According to a report by the Los Angeles Times from back then, analysts were optimistically expecting to save women $1,350 a year per person but warned that the law could theoretically also force some merchants to raise prices to ensure equality. However, a 2010 study conducted by Consumer Reports magazine showed  that gendered pricing persisted in many other parts of the United States.

The Niagara University women’s basketball team lost its second game of the season Monday night against the University of Pittsburgh. Although the team took an early lead, it was trounced by the  Pittsburgh Panthers , 70-54.
When the game ended, it was late. And the Purple Eagles were exhausted.
“It was an exciting game, but didn’t turn out as we wanted it to,” Emily Granruth, a 19-year-old guard, told The Washington Post in a telephone interview late Tuesday night. So they climbed into a charter bus headed home to Lewiston, N.Y., just outside Niagara Falls. Many fell asleep.
“When we woke up, we realized it was snowing. Then we were stuck,” Granruth said in an interview from the bus. “It was a little scary. We didn’t know what was going on.”
Massive mounds of snow are piling up in western New York. More than four feet of snow fell in parts of Buffalo on Tuesday, while a second storm is expected Thursday. Temperatures dropped below freezing from coast to coast. (AP)
A New York blizzard buried Interstate 90 near Buffalo, N.Y., stopping traffic in both directions. The Purple Eagles became stranded along with some 140 other vehicles , authorities said. Police made the rounds on snowmobiles to keep drivers informed.
The teammates exhausted their food and water supply, forced to pack team water bottles with fresh snow. When asked about the bathroom situation, Granruth said, “So far, so good,” but didn’t elaborate.
Early Wednesday morning, the team tweeted , “On our way back to campus now!” But it was a long trip for these athletes who were just trying to beat the storm.
The snow was blowing down so hard into Tuesday morning, the teammates couldn’t see outside. The roads hadn’t been plowed. And, about 2 a.m., the bus was stopped with 24 people on board. Head coach Kendra Faustin told CNN , “I’m assuming that somebody in the front of the line got stuck and everybody else had to stop, and that’s how we got where we are.”
As The Post’s Cindy Boren reported , the teammates passed the time talking to each other and checking in with their families back home. They used social media to keep loved ones updated.

Granruth said the bus driver told them the vehicle had about 200 hours of idle time, so they were able to keep the motor running to keep the lights on and the heater blowing.
“We’re doing fine,” Renee Polka, the team’s director of operations, told WIVB-TV on Tuesday. “The bus hasn’t stopped running since we left Pittsburgh. So that’s definitely a positive. So we’re probably luckier than others on the road right now.”
As the hours passed, Granruth said one of her teammates, Tiffany Corselli, started a team prayer “as a way to keep our spirits up.” In one photo posted to social media, the players were huddled inside the bus, holding hands and bowing their heads.
“At the top of every hour, I’ve been praying for our strength,” Corselli, a 19-year-old guard, told The Post on Tuesday night. “I just felt that it was something that we needed and it really brought our team together. I think everybody is hungry, restless, tired. … I know we’re in a bad state but there are people worse off then us.”
Tuesday was the coldest November morning since 1976. Across the country, temperatures fell below freezing in at least one city in all 50 states. The lake-effect storm , which some have dubbed “ thunder snow ,” smothered Buffalo in more than six feet of snow in some areas, leaving people stranded in their vehicles along roadways.
First responders were using snowmobiles from volunteers to respond to calls. At least four people have died — one in a vehicle accident, three others from cardiac arrest while shoveling snow, CNN reported.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) deployed the National Guard to Western New York to help those affected by the snowstorm.
Granruth said about five minutes before she spoke with The Post on Tuesday night, the team ran out of food. Police on snowmobiles came by and dropped off protein bars and packaged cookies. They filled their bottles with snow.
“We’re all a little worried, a little scared, but we’re sticking together and trying to help each other out,” she said at the time. “We’re really thinking about everyone else who’s stuck in the storm. We all hope it’s resolved quickly.”
A few hours later, the teammates posted a photo on Twitter showing their trip home.

Assistant coach Corinne Jones told WGRZ-TV it’s an experience they will never forget.
“You couldn’t set up a team bonding experience like this, I don’t think,” Jones said. “And we as coaches always talk about mental toughness and this is really a true test of how tough are we. I don’t hear a lot of complaining.”

Less punishing winds today  but temperatures almost as coldA somewhat subjective rating of the day’s weather, on a scale of 0 to 10.
4
Less wind makes the chill more tolerable. Still bitter compared to the usual November fare.
Express Forecast
Today: Partly to mostly sunny, less windy. Highs: Mid-30s.
Tonight: Partly to mostly cloudy. Lows: Mid-20s to low 30s.
Tomorrow: Partly to mostly sunny, not as cold. Highs: Mid-40s.
FORECAST IN DETAIL
Yesterday was the coldest Nov. 18 in D.C. since 1959 . Today promises a similar chill in the temperature department, though at least the wind isn’t as bad. A gradual warm-up is in store, but it gets off to a herky-jerky start with highs in the 40s on Thursday and back down to near or below 40 Friday, before a more consistent warming trend takes hold this weekend. By Sunday we’re in the 50s with a risk of rain.
Temperature Map
Temperatures: Latest D.C. area temperature map. See interactive map on our Weather Wall .
Today (Wednesday): The wind is less punishing today, but temperatures are almost just as cold as yesterday, perhaps a couple degrees warmer. From morning lows in the teens and 20s, afternoon highs only manage the mid-30s under partly to mostly sunny skies, with winds from the south-southwest near 10 mph. That’s still enough of a breeze to keep wind chills in the 20s through much of the day. Confidence : High
As we covered in yesterday’s PM Updat e, the record low maximum temperatures for today are 33 in D.C. (from 1880), 38 at Dulles (from 2008), and 35 at BWI (from 1880). Note that the 33 in D.C. in 1880 was observed at 24th St. and M St., the official reporting station before the switch to National Airport in 1942.
Tonight: Skies turn partly to mostly cloudy, which is good news if last night was too darn cold for you. The insulating effect of the clouds keeps temperatures from totally tanking, as lows range mainly from the mid-20s to low 30s. Confidence: High
For related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock . Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend…
Tomorrow (Thursday): Our gradual warm-up, uneven as it may be, begins in earnest on Thursday. As the chilly air mass starts to moderate, highs rise into the mid-40s, helped by partly to mostly sunny skies. Winds are breezy at times, from the west-southwest at around 10-15 mph. Confidence: High
Tomorrow night: The initial warming trend takes a hit as a reinforcing shot of cold air sends temperatures tumbling once again. Lows dip down to the 20s area-wide with mostly clear skies above. Confidence: Medium-High

A LOOK AHEAD
After Thursday’s one step forward in the warmer direction, we step back colder on Friday with highs only reaching the upper 30s to near 40. We’ll have just enough of a breeze to add an extra chill despite mostly sunny skies. Friday nights lows make a return visit to the 20s. Confidence: Medium-High
With high pressure in control, the weekend starts off with a mostly sunny Saturday, but still rather cool. Highs head for the mid-40s. As high pressure shifts to our east Friday night, we pick up a warmer flow from the south, which means milder lows in the 30s. Sunday sees the approach of rain from the southwest. Timing is still subject to change, but right now it looks like rain could arrive by afternoon as highs make a welcome return to the 50s. Confidence: Medium

Has The Daily Show surpassed SNL as Hollywoods farm teamBy Stephanie Merry November 19 Follow @stephmerry
As “Foxcatcher” hits theaters Friday, everyone is buzzing about Steve Carell’s big dramatic debut, not to mention his prosthetic nose (which is how you know this role has Oscar potential). He plays the real-life character of John du Pont, a homicidal multimillionaire, who became obsessed with two wrestler brothers. Carell turns in a creepy, troubling performance that doesn’t require any of the comedic talents that made the actor famous on “The Office.”
Carell got his start as a correspondent on “The Daily Show” before making the leap to prime time. He hadn’t done much onscreen beyond faux-serious interviews and sketch comedy on “The Dana Carvey Show,” when he nabbed the job of heading up Dunder Mifflin paper company on the American version of “The Office.” And at the time that seemed like a huge leap.

Now, though, it’s par for the course. “The Daily Show” correspondents tend to move on to bigger things. It’s become a breeding ground for up-and-comers.
For years, “Saturday Night Live” served that role: Hollywood’s farm team. Lorne Michaels put the spotlight on next-big-things, who used the show as a stepping stone. The list of funny people is staggering: Chevy Chase, Eddie Murphy, Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest, Chris Farley, Julia-Louis Dreyfus, Chris Rock and Amy Poehler to name very few.
But is “SNL”’s time as the taste-maker of things to come in peril? Aside from decent numbers last weekend, ratings have not been good . What’s more, the actors that “SNL” is churning out recently don’t end up having the varied careers and impressive reach of “Daily Show” alums. Kristen Wiig was hilarious in “Bridesmaids,” which she co-wrote, but she hasn’t gained much traction since, mainly starring in middling indie dramedies. (One big exception is “The Skeleton Twins,” co-starring another “SNL” alum Bill Hader, which was tremendous but didn’t get as much attention as it should have.)
Seth Meyers took over “Late Night,” which was a big get, and Andy Samberg stars in “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” but beyond that, cast members that left in the last five years haven’t produced much beyond the broadest comedy (Jason Sudeikis in “Horrible Bosses 2”) or the most niche (Fred Armisen on “Portlandia”).
Meanwhile, “Daily Show” alums are dominating in an array of spaces, in the comedy world and beyond. After Stephen Colbert paved the way with his own satirical news show, “The Colbert Report,” John Oliver has done the same. Video clips from “Last Week Tonight,” which airs on HBO on Sundays, are inevitably viral by first-thing Monday morning, traveling around the web with the same urgency of the silly ditties from “The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon” (an “SNL” alum). What sets the two apart is that viral clips of Fallon inevitably involve dance-offs or colorful xylophones, while videos from “Last Week Tonight” revolve around net neutrality or the American Legislative Exchange Council. Oliver shies away from being called a journalist, and yet he’s helping people understand complicated issues, albeit in a somewhat comical — and definitely share-worthy — way.
Current host Jon Stewart has also dabbled in more serious work. His directorial debut, “ Rosewater ,” came out last week. It follows a journalist, played by Gael García Bernal , who is detained in Iran because the government accuses him of spying.
The “Daily Show” contribution extends to kid’s fare (Josh Gad voiced the singing snowman, Olaf, in Disney inescapable “Frozen”), much dissected dramas (Olivia Munn is arguably the best part of “The Newsroom”) and the next frontier of entertainment (Rob Corddry stars in the Vimeo Web series “Wedlock” alongside Mark Duplass.)
There are more coming, too. Samantha Bee and Jason Jones, married “Daily Show” alums, had a pilot about a family road trip picked up by TBS . But SNL can at least take partial credit for Rob Riggle, who was a cast member of both shows. His new series , based on an Austrian series, is a comedy about a mayor of a small, struggling town.
But “The Daily Show” gets full credit for Carell. Maybe, amid the Oscar chatter and the accolades, he’s even forgotten about that time he tried out for SNL and they didn’t take him.

Android Lollipop review for dummies: Yes Google  you have changed the way I use thesmartphonePrint
This is what Android Lollipop update means to a layman.
Written by Rajkrishnan Menon | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:42 pm | Updated: November 21, 2014 11:12 am
‘Android 5 System Update': I wasn’t among the many who were eagerly waiting for this message to pop up, and when it did, I lazily said, ‘Later’. But it did not take no for an answer, it persisted. And I downloaded. The whole process took only a little over five minutes.
When my Nexus 5 rebooted, for a moment I thought it had morphed into a Nexus 6: The icons were different, the lock screen was different, the gallery app was gone. Even the fonts had changed. ‘Material design’, I am told.
But I think I’ve made a terrible mistake: Now I have to get used to my phone all over again. For instance, I have to tap twice to open an app or an email. As a first-time Android/Touch phone user, I had barely got used to the one-touch trick. And I haven’t yet figured out how to get rid of the ‘BBM: Connected’ icon from the lock screen.
That’s right. Although I rarely use it, I still have BBM on my phone as a relic from, and a reminder of, a turbulent, not so distant past when my so-called smart phone, a BB, depended on me to stay sorted and alive when it should have been the other way round.
Anyway, I am even finding it slightly difficult to scroll the apps: I am convinced there is a lag. But I also noticed that the lockscreen tells me things like “12 minutes until full” when the phone is charging. Hmm.
Android ‘L’. Looks lighter, trimmer. I also found out about the Flashlight problems (But I guess that has more to do with Nexus) and how it is tough to ‘silence’ your phone totally with this OS. But maybe I’ll learn to like it.
Ok, so I wanted to Google something, and opened Chrome. All I wanted was one tab: For a simple, routine Google search. Whoa! Many of my recent tabs were floating around: Office mail, the Express epaper tab, my Twitter page…I started getting rid of them, stopping after six or seven tabs to think, “Oh God! This is never-ending.
Am I deleting my bookmarks, too?!” No. As it happened, I was only swiping away my recent tabs. It was like I had opened Chrome on my laptop.
I realise these guys meant business when they said, “We’d like to change the way you use smartphones and the web.”
Mission Lollipop has begun.

Released Indian fishermen to return from Sri LankatomorrowSri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Written by Arun Sharma | Chennai | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:31 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 7:54 pm
Exercising powers of the Presidential pardon; the Sri Lankan government on Wednesday released from Colombo prison the five Indian fishermen sentenced to death. With the pardon officially coming into effect, all five of them – P Emerson, 40, P Agustus, 32, R Wilson, 42, K Prasad, 30, and J Langlet, 22 – who were arrested on November 28, 2011 for smuggling heroin,were shifted to the Indian embassy in Colombo. All of them are traditional fishermen from the coast of Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu.

Confirming the release, a senior official at the Indian high commission told Indian Express that they are likely to be taken to Chennai on Thursday itself. “Five of them are at the Indian embassy in Colombo now. Likely to land in Chennai by Thursday,” the official said.

Skenitta, wife of Prasad, one of the five fishermen, thanked the Indian and Sri Lankan authorities for their decision to release the fishermen. “He just spoke to me over phone from the Indian high embassy. I cant wait anymore. We are leaving to Chennai tonight to receive him,” said Skenitta.
Prior to the formalities for seeking presidential pardon, the fishermen had withdrawn their appeal against the death sentence on Tuesday.
Five of them are slated to land at Chennai international airport on Thursday.

Operation to continue till Rampals arrest: Haryana CMKhattarPrint
CM Manohar Khattar faces the first major test on the law and order issue involving Rampal since he took over as Chief Minister recently.
By: Press Trust of India | Chandigarh | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:54 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 8:30 pm
Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday said the operation to nab ‘godman’ Rampal will “continue till he is arrested” from Satlok Ashram at Barwala in Hissar district.
The Chief Minister chose Twitter to put forward his views on the violence at Barwala which left over 200 persons injured.
Khattar, who is also the Home Minister, faces the first  major test on the law and order issue involving Rampal since he took over as Chief Minister recently.
There are a number of self-proclaimed godmen in Haryana and neighboring Punjab having a considerable say during Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in the two states.
Khattar has not met the media since the showdown commenced at Barwala last week between the Ashram followers and security personnel, including paramilitary forces.

In first tweet Khattar said, “Serious charges of sedition against Rampal & several followers by Haryana Police. Operations to continue till he is arrested from Ashram.”
In the second tweet, the Chief Minister said, “Govt. & Police are committed to ensure strict compliance of High Court orders, priority is to uphold the law without loss of innocent lives.”
Even as the operation was on at Barwala, he met people at his residence here on Wednesday and Tuesday, but did not meet the media who were briefed by the DGP S N Vashisht and Additional Chief Secretary (Home) P K Mahapatra.
Earlier on November 15, Khattar had through a statement appealed to Rampal to present himself in court “in a peaceful manner” and “without any hindrance”, saying, “one must give utmost priority to upholding the dignity of judicial system.”
He had also appealed to his followers to cooperate in following the directions of Punjab and Haryana High Court.
“In a democratic set up, one must give utmost priority to upholding the dignity of judicial system,” he had said last week after which he made no comments on the situation.
Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday issued a fresh non-bailable warrant against Rampal after he failed to appear in the contempt case.

India to overtake US to become second-largest Internet marketsoonIndia will touch 302 million by end of this year, overtaking the US as the second-largest Internet market in the world.
By: PTI | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:54 pm | Updated: November 21, 2014 8:20 am
Buoyed by strong growth in Internet consumption on mobile devices, the number of people online in India is forecast to touch 302 million by end of this year, overtaking the US as the second-largest Internet market in the world.
According to a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International, the number of Internet users in India is expected to grow 32 per cent to 302 million this year from 213 million at the end of December last year.
The Internet userbase in the country is further estimated to grow to 354 million by June 2015.
Currently, India has the third-largest Internet userbase in the world but with the estimated growth, the country will overtake the US as the second-largest Internet userbase in the world by December-end.
At present, China leads with more than 600 million Internet users, while the US has an estimated 279 million users.
“The Internet in India took more than a decade to move from 10 million to 100 million and 3 years from 100 million to 200 million.
“However, it took only a year to move from 200 to 300 million users. Clearly, Internet is mainstream in India today,” IAMAI-IMRB said in a statement.
Of the 278 million users, 177 million are in urban India, higher by 29 per cent from last year. This is expected to reach 190 million by December 2014 and 216 million by June 2015.
In rural India, the number of Internet users increased by 39 per cent to reach 101 million in October 2014. It is expected to reach 112 million by December 2014 and 138 million by June 2015.

The ball is in Terry Walshs court  says Sports Authority ofIndiaTerry Walsh insisted that he might rejoin the team before the Champions Trophy and was waiting to receive and study a fresh proposal in the next two days. (Source: Express File)
By: Press Trust of India | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:48 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 8:19 pm
With Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal agreeing in principle to Terry Walsh’s demands, the ball is now in the Australian’s court to take a call on whether to continue as India’s chief hockey coach and the SAI expects him to make up his mind in the next 4-5 days.
In a major setback for Indian hockey, the men’s national team chief coach Walsh yesterday decided to fly back to Australia after his contractual talks with Hockey India and his employer, Sports Authority of India (SAI) broke down.
Walsh, however, insisted that he might rejoin the team before the Champions Trophy and was waiting to receive and study a fresh proposal in the next two days.
But SAI Executive Director (Teams) Sudhir Sethia ruled out sending Walsh any fresh proposal and said they are now waiting to hear from the Australian’s side.
“He met the Sports Minister yesterday and the minister has agreed to all his demands in principle. But he said he wants to go home for a few days. He said he needs a break,” Sethia told PTI.
“We are not going to send any fresh proposal to him. Everything has been discussed in detail. Now he will have to
get back to us.
“He said he will have a re-look at the proposal once he returns to Australia and get back to us with 4-5 days. The ball is in his court now. It is now upto him whether he wants to continue or not,” said Sethia, mincing no words.
Walsh, who replaced fellow Australia Michael Nobbs as India’s chief coach in October last year, had resigned from his post last month, demanding more autonomy and decision making powers.
The Australian’s month-long notice period ends today but he left for Perth without signing a fresh contract after talks between him, SAI and HI failed to make any breakthrough.
Even though the Walsh’s demands have been agreed in principle, his return might not materialise as Hockey India is not too keen on to have him back in the fold.
Differences between Walsh and Hockey India crept up after national president Narinder Batra brought up allegations of financial irregularities against the Australian during his stint with USA Field Hockey.
Walsh, however, has completely denied these allegations and termed them as baseless.
But an official who was present in these talks has indeed confirmed that Walsh’s differences with HI was the bone of contention for the deadlock.
“His demands were not such an issue. He was even ready to compromise on some of his demands. But it is the internal difference between Walsh and Hockey India which really is the main reason for the deadlock,” the official said.
Under Walsh, Indian hockey has made considerable progress in the last one year having qualified for the 2016 Rio Olympics after winning the gold in the Incheon Asian Games and rare Test series victory over Australia.

Wishing away the world without the WestComments

We very much appreciate Erik Voeten’s comment on our recent piece in the National Interest and welcome the opportunity to respond.
In our original World Without the West essay (2007), we argued that emerging powers are preferentially engaging with each other — “routing around” the Western liberal order rather than joining it or trying actively to undermine it. This argument attracted two main criticisms. Consistent with realist theories of international politics, the first critique posits that what we’re witnessing today is simply the early stages of an eventual attempt to overthrow the liberal order. (We disagree, but we’ll save that one for another day.) On the other side of the spectrum, however, is the view articulated by Voeten that a combination of interests, inducements and constraints will lead countries like China to ultimately conform, more or less, to the way the United States and the West have done business for the last 70 years.
The crux of our disagreement with this liberal internationalist perspective largely revolves around two questions. Will Chinese-led multilateral institutions “really fundamentally challenge the existing order or have profound implications for China’s ties to global multilateral institutions?” And even when they have similar functional objectives — on issues like regional stability, counterterrorism or poverty alleviation — will their approach be sufficiently different from liberal practice so as to diverge from prevailing norms and institutions? Voeten thinks the answer is no to both these questions.
We disagree because we think it’s overly optimistic to assume that Chinese interests and behavior will conform quite so neatly to the post-WWII system. And, to put a finer point on it, we believe both logic and evidence are now frequently pointing in the opposite direction. The world already has an Asian Development Bank. It already has ASEAN. Institutions such as those are the examples of regime complexity and forum shopping that Voeten points to, intended to advance specific interests “while remaining firmly tied to the global institutional architecture.”
Voeten is right to point out that European and Japanese multilateral initiatives have had those characteristics. But we don’t think the developments we’ve long pointed to are just a matter of the Chinese and their compatriot members seeking marginal gains at the edges of a liberal international order. If pursuing similar objectives were the point of these new institutions, why would the Chinese bother to create them? Why would they exclude the United States, Japan and other Western powers? And why, in cases such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization or the BRICS mechanism, would they counterpose their mission and purpose to those of liberal institutions?
Chinese-led organizations are not all going to follow the mold of other multilateral initiatives. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was explicitly designed to complement and advance the state of the art of existing multilateral development banks, by adding political conditionality that ties lending to democracy and human rights. The United States was a founding member of the EBRD with the second greatest number of shares after the European Union; it was also a founding member of the Asian Development Bank.  Neither characteristic is true of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank .
In contrast to those who predict a future of convergence and integration, we believe it is increasingly difficult to assume that the preferences of a rising and modernizing China regarding global order and global outcomes will come to be the same or at least broadly consistent with those of the United States. That’s the master assumption of the liberal internationalist mindset. Is it correct? The realist viewpoint says it probably isn’t — and expects that China will likely challenge the U.S.-led global order instead. We think the evidence of the last few years at a minimum ought to raise very large question marks around either of these views.
Minus those assumptions as a starting point, it’s easier to see Chinese initiatives for what they are: a strategic effort to route around Western world order ideas, institutions and rules. The point is to create an alternative set of ideas, institutions and rules that are aligned with a Chinese vision of how political economy and state power come together. And while that vision is very much a work in progress, our bet is that it’ll be sufficiently different from what you’ll find in “the West.” In fact, we think China and its friends in the emerging world have started espousing and living it.

Netflix pulls Bill Cosbys new specialBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 19 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
In the wake of multiple rape allegations against Bill Cosby, NBC has canceled a project starring the 77-year-old comedian and Netflix is postponing the launch of his stand-up comedy special. (Reuters)
Yesterday, I wrote that any attempt to try to sell new Bill Cosby projects would probably backfire: Trying to push nostalgia for his family-friendly image could only raise questions about the sexual assault allegations that have been lodged against him. At the time, NBC and Netflix still had projects involving Cosby in the works, respectively a family sitcom and a stand-up special pegged to Cosby’s birthday.
Late last night, a Netflix spokesman e-mailed me and a number of other reporters to say that “At this time we are postponing the launch of the new stand up comedy special ‘Bill Cosby 77.’ ”
That is not an outright cancellation. Netflix could still decide to air the special if Cosby’s reputation improves, or quietly slip it into users’ queues at a later date. But the postponement is a nod to the idea that a Bill Cosby comedy special is no longer going to feel like family-friendly viewing the day after Thanksgiving. And it is an acknowledgement that there is presently no public relations campaign that can sell Cosby’s message without raising the question of whether he is personally qualified as the messenger.
Over the years, men like Woody Allen and Roman Polanski have continued to do work that is celebrated by their peers in Hollywood, despite serious allegations of sexual misconduct made against them. Neither Allen, Polanski or Cosby has served time on criminal charges, though in 2006, Cosby settled a civil suit brought against him by Andrea Constand, who accused him of sexual assault.
That at least one famous man is experiencing consequences for such accusations feels like an extraordinary moment, but it is one that raises important, uncomfortable and as yet-unanswered questions.
Why the differing treatment for these three artists? Is it that in Allen’s and Polanski’s cases, there is only one alleged victim to stand against the important directors, with all their reputation and power, while Cosby has been accused by multiple women? Is it that while Allen was never charged and Polanski alleged that he was the victim of judicial misconduct, Cosby’s settlement in the civil suit feels like an admission of guilt? Or is it that Cosby’s alleged behavior is in such grotesque contradiction with the specific family- values doctrine he preaches that it hollows out the very message that makes him valuable?
The difficulty in answering these questions grows out of a larger issue: We have yet to grapple with guidelines for what we should ask of big entertainment companies and sports teams, which are in the business of making money off of our admiration for famous people.
If we want to balance our concern and respect for alleged victims with concern for due process under the law and the rights of the accused, should an allegation of rape or sexual abuse render someone unemployable? Or would that require a conviction on such charges? What standard should a movie studio, a TV network or a sports franchise use to make choices about cutting someone loose in the absence of a charge or a conviction, given systemic problems in the way law enforcement handles rape and sexual assault cases? If someone is convicted or loses a civil suit, what sort of repentance ought he make to earn back not just his freedom, but public esteem?
Right now, the answer appears to be that your comedy special gets pulled if the outcry gets loud enough and enough women come forward to allege that you hurt them. It is a rule based on expedience rather than principles. That may be fine for business decisions. But it’s awfully bad for achieving a baseline agreement about what should disqualify someone for prominent roles in American public life.

Republicans should snub Steve KingBy Jennifer Rubin November 19 Follow @JRubinBlogger
The Des Moines Register reports, “Iowa’s Steve King is expanding his footprint as a presidential kingmaker. The conservative congressman with the fitting last name is launching his own annual multicandidate forum for presidential hopefuls.”  The report continues :
“It’ll be an event that all the nation stops and looks at,” King told The Des Moines Register in a telephone interview Monday. “What gets said and done, some of those things will be driving the conversation in the country.”
The inaugural Iowa Freedom Summit will be in Des Moines on Saturday, Jan. 24, more than a year from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. King’s co-host is Citizens United, a conservative organization best known for influencing campaign finance in this country.
Three Republicans who are seriously weighing 2016 presidential bids are already booked as headline speakers for the summit, which will have no cost to attend: Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and former Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum.

It would be a grave error for these or other Republicans to attend or to seek the stamp of approval from King, whose language and views on illegal immigrants have been so noxious as to draw rebukes from his own party. King’s  infamous  comments are indicative of a tiny segment of the GOP that is not only  anti-illegal immigration but anti-immigrant. There is no place in a party, especially one trying to remake its image, for remarks such as those King has uttered.
A candidate need not share the views of every sponsor whose event he attends. But in the case of King, there is no way to separate him from the event nor to separate his attempt at gaining legitimacy from those Republicans showing up at his request. As a simple matter of politics, any candidate appearing with King will be seen as legitimizing his views. They risk having their pictures — and their views — linked.
Cruz earlier this year walked out of an event in which the audience displayed some anti-Israel sentiments, declaring, he was “saddened to see that some here – not everyone, but some here – are so consumed with hate that you cannot address your brother.” He knows that attendance and association matter in politics and sometimes you simply cannot “stand” with those espousing toxic views. So why would Cruz jump when King barks and give Democrats the easy attack ad? Sen. Cruz’s office and a representative of Governor Huckabee refused repeated requests for comment.
I suppose candidates will say that King’s forum is an important grassroots event and they want a chance to meet the good citizens of Iowa. Well, there are lots of places to meet Iowans and many other gatherings that are not run by someone whose comments could easily be confused with those of radicals long since disowned by the GOP (like the John Birchers). I was curious to see if Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was planning to attend. (Earlier in the year while campaigning and lunching with King was confronted by pro-immigration activists. He seemed t o flee the scene .) A representative from his office said he would not be attending, but declined to comment on the reason why. Rand Paul certainly understands that you have to “show up” to earn the votes of non-whites who view the GOP with suspicion. And perhaps he understands that to earn their trust, there are places where you cannot show up.
Hopefully the candidates will reconsider going and instead, choose to attend events hosted the many mainstream conservative organizations that populate Iowa. They have their pick of pro-family, pro-life, pro-farmer and pro-business groups, so they need not attend an anti-immigrant’s shindig. By empowering King, they would only harm their party and their own bona fides with nontraditional GOP voters. They should stay away. Period.
UPDATE: Staffers for both King and Paul later responded to this post, and I commented on their claims here .

Ted Leonsis again says Monumental Network could be an alternative to Comcast SportsNetBy Dan Steinberg November 19 Follow @dcsportsbog

Ted Leonsis once again raised the possibility this week of eventually broadcasting Caps and Wizards games on Monumental Network when his deals with Comcast SportsNet expire.
For more than a year, Leonsis has suggested that a fully realized Monumental Network could one day broadcast Caps and Wizards games, in addition to other local programming. If, you know, an acceptable deal with Comcast SportsNet could not be reached. Hint, hint.
Sports Business Journal reported last month that Leonsis had already begun negotiations with Comcast SportsNet about an extension of the Caps’ broadcast deal, which runs through the 2016-17 season, according to SBJ. The Wizards’ deal runs through 2020-2021, according to SBJ, and John Ourand speculated that an early extension for the Caps could help increase Leonsis’s leverage:
The Capitals currently make around $13 million per year from Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic, sources said, and the Wizards pull down around $17 million, a figure that does not include an upfront payment that Comcast made when the deal was signed with former owner Abe Pollin. To date, Comcast SportsNet has resisted opening its Wizards contract, which sources say has terms that are favorable to the RSN….
The move to try to sync up the rights also fits in with Leonsis’ strategy around his digital channel, Monumental Network. Leonsis has not been shy about his desire to build Monumental Network into a service that potentially could house his teams’ rights. Leonsis’ threat of putting his teams’ rights on a platform that he owns carries more weight if both teams’ rights expire at the same time.
Whether or not that threat is viable, Leonsis returned to it on Tuesday during an Ask the Owner appearance on WTOP . Host Bruce Alan asked Leonsis whether Monumental Network could one day be its own cable channel; the owner said he hoped so.
Leonsis then said Monumental Sports is still not profitable, thanks to high player salaries, the mortgage and principal (plus maintenance costs) paid for Verizon Center, and the two broadcast deals.
“We have very, very low compensation for our cable rights,” Leonsis said. “And that’s our deal, that we’re living with. But at some point, those rights will revert back to us. And when you look around, there’s a lot of value in owning your own network, or owning equity in the network. I just served as chairman of the NBA media committee, and I saw how ESPN and Turner valued the rights to NBA games , and it was a big number up. They’re very very smart people, and they valued it from research, because live sports and news are really the only two parts of programming that bring people together live in big numbers.
“And so we know that sports programming is very very valuable,” Leonsis said. “So what we have to do is optimize all of our media assets. And we love the people at Comcast — I’m hoping we can do something with them — but if we can’t, there’s [the MASN example]. MASN is an independent network owned by the Orioles and the Nationals, and they got onto cable.
“And so we [also] launched the Monumental Network. Today it’s what’s called an over-the-top network. We do lots of video, lots of programming, we’ve built a studio, we’ve hired 30 people. We know how to broadcast games — we’re doing Mystics games, we’re doing Caps preseason games, we’re doing coaches shows, we’re doing 20, 30 hours a week in video. I’m very proud of the work that we’re doing to be ready for one day if our rights burn off.
“And when our rights burn off, we want to work with Comcast. But if we can’t, then we launch the Monumental Network. It’s pretty simple.”
Then Alan asked whether Monumental could theoretically be a home for Nats broadcasts.
“Well I think first we’d want to do the Caps, and then you’d want to do the Wizards and the Mystics,” Leonsis said “And the name of our holding company is Monumental Sports and Entertainment. ESPN was sports and entertainment. And I believe that it should be broader than just a regional sports network. I think that music and concerts and where to dine and all of that information would make a lot of sense in both a digital and a cable format.”
Leonsis said attendance for the Wizards is “very good” and “growing,” adding that 100-level seats are “pretty much sold out.”
“We have about 11,000, 11,500 season ticket holders now, which is very very good growth for us,” he said. “And my bet is we have a really good year, we’ll go into next offseason, have 90-percent-plus renewals, and then we’ll start to sell it out.”

Coming in 2015: The Third Restatement of Conflict of LawsBy Will Baude November 19
The American Law Institute recently announced that it will be pursuing four new “Restatements” of the law next year — the Restatements being an academic attempt to rationalize a particular area of common law doctrine. They’re partly descriptive, partly normative, restating their area of law in the same way a speaker might rephrase a confusing question from the audience.
In any event, given my other hat as a conflict-of-laws nerd, I was particularly interested to see that one of the new Restatements will be a Third Restatement of Conflicts. The First Restatement of Conflicts by Joseph Beale was famously formalist and territorial. The Second Restatement was the opposite, famously criticized by Doug Laycock for “trying to be all things to all people” and therefore producing “mush.” I’ll be very interested to see what direction the Third Restatement takes.
And while I don’t wish to pessimistic about the project at all — on the contrary! — I think this is an appropriate time to call to mind this comment from Perry Dane:
Publishing a restatement of choice of law is an ironic act. The project of all the restatements, of torts and contracts and the rest, is partly to spur uniformity in the law. But if the law ever truly became uniform, there would be no need for choice of law, or for a restatement thereof. The solution to the paradox is that a restatement of conflicts, even as it tries to build common ground on choice of law, must also respect the lack of common ground elsewhere. It must, to be true to its own task, assume that the other restatements will fail in their ambitions. Hence, a restatement of choice of law needs to distinguish, carefully and rigorously, between choice of law and municipal law. It can prescribe the former but not the latter.
What I have called first-order choice of law-a legal system’s effort to work out its own substantive doctrine in the light of jurisdictional complexity-occupies a gray zone between municipal law and second-order choice of law. Nevertheless, to the extent that first-order choice of law proceeds from the substantive concerns of particular legal systems, a restatement of choice of law needs to treat such first-order questions with care and humility.

Unfair to try Muslim defendant over anniversary of September 11 attacksFrom State v. M.R. (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. Nov. 18, 2014) :
Defendant’s trial began on September 8, 2010, and ended on September 22, 2010. He contends that scheduling the trial of a fundamentalist Muslim during the anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, following “substantial media coverage of the Ground Zero Mosque and Quran Burning controversies,” deprived him of an impartial jury and a fair trial. He further contends the court conducted inadequate voir dire of prospective jurors to determine their attitudes about those events and defendant’s religion.
Not so, says the court; see pp. 19-27 of the opinion.
The defendant, by the way, is the same one involved in the 2009 civil restraining order case in which a New Jersey trial court accepted a “cultural defense” as to nonconsensual sex:
The record reflects that plaintiff, S.D., and defendant, M.J.R., are citizens of Morocco and adherents to the Muslim faith. They were wed in Morocco in an arranged marriage on July 31, 2008, when plaintiff was seventeen years old. The parties did not know each other prior to the marriage. On August 29, 2008, they came to New Jersey as the result of defendant’s employment in this country as an accountant….
[Long discussion of the wife's allegations of abuse, which included several instances of nonconsensual sex as well as other abuse, omitted for space reasons. -EV]
Upon their return to the apartment, defendant forced plaintiff to have sex with him while she cried. Plaintiff testified that defendant always told her
this is according to our religion. You are my wife, I c[an] do anything to you. The woman, she should submit and do anything I ask her to do.
After having sex, defendant took plaintiff to a travel agency to buy a ticket for her return to Morocco. However the ticket was not purchased, and the couple returned to the apartment. Once there, defendant threatened divorce, but nonetheless again engaged in nonconsensual sex while plaintiff cried. Later that day, defendant and his mother took plaintiff to the home of the Imam and, in the presence of the Imam, his wife, and defendant’s mother, defendant verbally divorced plaintiff….
The judge found from his review of the evidence that plaintiff had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant had engaged in harassment, pursuant to N.J.S.A. § 2C:33-4b and c, and assault. He found that plaintiff had not proven criminal restraint, sexual assault or criminal sexual contact. In finding assault to have occurred, the judge credited, as essentially uncontradicted, plaintiff’s testimony regarding the events of November 1, 16 and 22, 2008. The judge based his findings of harassment on plaintiff’s “clear proof” of the nonconsensual sex occurring during the three days in November and on the events of the night of January 15 to 16. He did not credit plaintiff’s testimony of sexual assaults thereafter, since there was no corroboration in plaintiff’s complaints to the police. [Footnote: In response to an objection by plaintiff's counsel, the judge later recognized that the police report upon which he relied in finding no corroboration for plaintiff's claims had not been admitted in evidence because of its hearsay nature. However, he declined to modify his ruling.]
While recognizing that defendant had engaged in sexual relations with plaintiff against her expressed wishes in November 2008 and on the night of January 15 to 16, 2009, the judge did not find sexual assault or criminal sexual conduct to have been proven. He stated:
This court does not feel that, under the circumstances, that this defendant had a criminal desire to or intent to sexually assault or to sexually contact the plaintiff when he did. The court believes that he was operating under his belief that it is, as the husband, his desire to have sex when and whether he wanted to, was something that was consistent with his practices and it was something that was not prohibited.
After acknowledging that this was a case in which religious custom clashed with the law, and that under the law, plaintiff had a right to refuse defendant’s advances, the judge found that defendant did not act with a criminal intent when he repeatedly insisted upon intercourse, despite plaintiff’s contrary wishes.
Having found acts of domestic violence consisting of assault and harassment to have occurred, the judge turned to the issue of whether a final restraining order should be entered. He found such an order unnecessary, vacated the temporary restraints previously entered in the matter and dismissed plaintiff’s domestic violence action.
The appellate court in that earlier case quite rightly reversed the trial court’s refusal to enter the restraining order:
Defendant’s conduct in engaging in nonconsensual sexual intercourse was unquestionably knowing, regardless of his view that his religion permitted him to act as he did.
As the judge recognized, the case thus presents a conflict between the criminal law and religious precepts. In resolving this conflict, the judge determined to except defendant from the operation of the State’s statutes as the result of his religious beliefs. In doing so, the judge was mistaken.
The appellate court remanded for entry of a restraining order. Note that the woman was pregnant with the couple’s child at the time of the initial hearing, so that despite the divorce it seemed likely that the man and the woman would remain in contact; this is legally relevant because restraining orders are designed to prevent future harm, not to punish for past misbehavior.

Study shows the media has a clear bias  in favor of dogsCanines catch a wave

"Thus, we conclude that dogs are an important factor in news decisions."
So ends the abstract of a paper that, at long last, quantifies the effect of dogs on the propagation of news stories. Dogs, it is determined, are important.
Be honest: You clicked the link to this story because it mentions dogs. Dogs are terrific, speaking both objectively and with the full editorial weight of the Washington Post at my back. That excellence lead to affection; that affection to curiosity. The curiosity that drove your click, as it turns out, is not unique to you. It is shared by editorial teams at newspapers.
To determine the value of canines to the popularity of news stories, Matthew Atkinson of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Maria Dean and Joseph Uscinski of the University of Miami, identified 18 dog-related and 334 non-dog-related stories that appeared in the national section of the New York Times since 2000. The team then checked ten other newspapers (both local and national) to see which stories got picked up the next day.
In short: A front page story in the New York Times was picked up by other papers at 3.1 times the rate of a story from the last page of the national news section. A story that involved a dog that appeared on the last page of the section appeared in other newspapers at 2.6 times the rate of a non-dog story with the same placement. In other words: "having a canine subject in a national news event produced coverage of the story that was 80% as large as the effect of the difference between being NYT front-page and back-page worthy."
It's important to note that the dog stories at issue are not "36 times cute dogs got baths" or things of that ilk. (The Times rarely runs stories on those types of topics.) The 18 dog stories that the researchers identified included dogs as essential components to actual news. "Postal Work Unfairly Maligned, Study Says," was one; "First Dog Makes His Debut," another.
That second example is offered in a rather defensive explanation of why the research has value. "How many [Americas] learned about what President Obama was doing in April 2009 as a result of the arrival of Bo, his Portuguese water dog?," the researchers ask. The answer is unknowable, but it is probably greater than one.
The researchers did not conduct any similar studies involving the use of cats. This may be because cats don't lend themselves as readily to the sorts of puns that (lamentably) are peppered throughout the research document. It may be because there are not as many news stories in which cats play a similarly prominent role. Or it may simply be due to the well-known fact that cats are worse animals than dogs. It's a mystery for the ages.

SNLs Cecily Strong to be fourth female comedian to headline White House Corrrespondents DinnerBy Emily Heil November 19 Follow @emilyaheil

Finally, a response to the grumbling at last year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, where the evening’s comedic entertainment by Joel McHale was met in some quarters with ‘What, was Amy Poehler too busy?’
“Saturday Night Live” cast member Cecily Strong will headline the 2015 installment of the annual black-tie extravaganza, the White House Correspondents’ Association announced on Wednesday.
Strong will be the fourth woman to take on the duty of roasting the president and the press corps that covers him. Since 1983, when the annual tradition of a comedian’s performance began, the three women headliners have been Paula Poundstone in 1992, Elayne Boosler in 1993, and Wanda Sykes in 2009.
“Her political humor is sly and edgy, and it comes with a Chicago accent,” WHCD President Christi Parsons said in an e-mail, noting the comedian boasts some journalistic and political connections:  Strong’s father was Bill Strong, the well-known AP bureau chief at the Illinois statehouse.
It’s not that the WHCDA members responsible for booking the funnymen and -women haven’t tried to expand their pool of recruits in pursuit of gender equity. The WHCD is notorious in comedy circles as a tough gig. The roomful of journos and pols are known as a jaded audience with plenty of thin skins, and it’s tricky to pull off the kind of bipartisan barbs the job demands.
 

Party leaders arent so far apart on immigration and KeystoneBy Max Ehrenfreund November 19 Follow @MaxEhrenfreund
Obama meets with Congressional leaders after the midterm. (AP/Evan Vucci)
A bill to force approval of the Keystone XL pipeline fell one vote short of overcoming a filibuster Tuesday night. Obama likely would have vetoed the bill anyway. That doesn't mean that he actually opposes the pipeline. However he feels about it, the administration could, conceptually, approve it eventually . Rather, many opponents of the bill cite the principle of the separation of powers. The legislature makes general laws , and the executive branch enforces them in each particular case. As Sen. Chris Coons (D)  said , "It's not Congress's job to issue construction permits."
From the conservative point of view, however, it's ironic that the pipeline's detractors are so worried about what Congress's job is. Obama is about to do that job himself anyway, some argue , by granting millions of illegal immigrants quasi-legal status. They don't dispute that the executive branch needs to make decisions about which cases are the most important to prosecute, but argue that making such broad changes amounts to rewriting the law .
There's plenty of picking and choosing going on when it comes to the idea of the separation of powers, but that's no surprise. The truth is, there isn't a huge disagreement among party leaders about what should be done about immigration and the pipeline. These debates are about politics, not policy.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest discussed President Obama's speech for Thursday evening that will detail a proposal to fix the nation's broken immigration system. (AP)
This debate over the pipeline started because  for some reason , Sen. Mary Landrieu (D)  thinks a vote on the pipeline will help her chances of holding onto her seat in a runoff next month. Obama doesn't seem to think the pipeline is all that important either way, but he has dragged his feet, perhaps because he opposes it, or perhaps he is  delaying approval   because he wants to be able to use the permit  as a bargaining chip  in future negotiations with Republican lawmakers.
The G.O.P. establishment supports immigration reform, both because it would help  the economy and the party's future electoral prospects . The Senate already passed legislation overhauling immigration laws, with strong GOP support. Speaker But Speaker John Boehner and Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell have said repeatedly that the planned order will antagonize the rank and file of the G.O.P caucus, who already aren't interested in dealmaking with Obama. The problem for the leadership is that the base is opposed to real immigration reform, and  it isn't clear whether Congress could deliver a bill in any case.
As a result, Washington is spending the week debating not deportations and the pipeline, but who will make these decisions, and what they can get in exchange.

Number of the day: 17 percent. That's the decline in the number of medical personnel volunteering to treat Ebola patients in West Africa since Gov. Chris Christie, among others, declared mandatory quarantines for returning doctors and nurses, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development. Joel Rose for NPR .
Chart of the day:
Metropolitan areas in the United States are less segregated by race than ever, and segregation is likely to continue declining as whites become a smaller and smaller share of the population. Tanvi Misra in The Atlantic .
1. Top story: Keystone bill filibustered
Republicans will return to the bill next year. They'll have enough votes to beat a filibuster, but possibly not a presidential veto. That makes a negotiation of some kind with Obama more likely. Ben Geman and Clare Foran in National Journal . 
In the end, Democrats spurned Landrieu. "Many senators feel they have too often bent over backward to accommodate Ms. Landrieu and protect her Senate seat — one of the last remaining Democratic seats in the South. They finally revolted, in what they said was a vote of principle against legislation they believe would harm the environment." Ashley Parker and Coral Davenport in The New York Times .
The bill probably wouldn't have helped her anyway. Whites in the South have been turning against Democrats for years, and now there just aren't that many Democratic voters left. Blacks turned out in large numbers for Landrieu, but it wasn't enough for her to avoid a runoff. Nate Cohn in The New York Times .
But Keystone still matters for the environment and the oil industry. Supporters of the pipeline are fond of saying that TransCanada could always find other ways of getting bitumen to refineries, but many Canadians are opposed to the company's plans, too. And while oil prices are falling worldwide, tar sands in Alberta could still be profitable. Steve Mufson in The Washington Post .
2. Top opinions: Health care costs, the economy, sexual assault, Republicans
There's a problem with paying doctors for performance. As insurance companies look to reduce costs and encourage doctors to practice more effective medicine, there's a risk that they are forcing a one-size-fits-all treatment onto a diverse group of patients. Pamela Hartzband and Jerome Groopman in The New York Times .
WOLF: Aggressive monetary policy hasn't been enough to stimulate global demand. A combination of lingering fear from the financial crisis and long-term trends in demographics and productivity are holding back economic growth everywhere.  The Financial Times .
SHILLER: Economic growth requires creativity, which means relying on the wisdom of the crowd.  "We need economic institutions that somehow promote the concerted creative actions of a wide swath of the world’s people. They should not be corporatist institutions, dominated by central leaders, but should derive their power from the fluid actions of modern crowds."  Project Syndicate .
How much does sexual assault cost college students? Victims of rape typically pay around $2,000 in medical expenses, and students might lose a semester's tuition if they drop out of school to avoid their abusers. For a student from a poor family, sexual assault can mean giving up on a college degree. Alexandra Brodsky in  The Washington Post .
NOAH SMITH: What exactly is the real difference between Republicans and Democrats? "There's no question that the Democrats and Republicans hate each other... For all the demonization, though, it's not clear what Democrats and Republicans actually intend to do differently when they get in power." Now Republicans have a chance to stop the obstructionism and show what makes them different. Bloomberg .
3. What Obama's executive order on immigration will do
The planned action will reportedly not defer deportations for parents who brought their children here illegally. The order will include parents of citizens and legal permanent residents, but not parents of "dreamers" -- undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children and who were largely protected by the original DACA order, according to anonymous sources. Heidi Przybyla and Mike Dorning in Bloomberg .
LINKER: Supporting immigration reform does not mean executive action. "The rule of law is far more about how things are done than about what is done." And an executive order would be beyond the bounds of Obama's constitutional authority.  The Week . 
SARGENT: Existing immigration law gives Obama the authority to delay deportations. Conservative critics have tried to make the dispute a question of the executive branch's constitutional authority. In fact, the text of the statute is clear. Congress has already explicitly given Obama everything he needs to act. What's more, an order will probably not affect the total number of undocumented immigrants deported every year, which will remain small in any case.  The Washington Post .
4. Autos with defective Takata airbags will be recalled
The recall will apply to millions of vehicles from several automakers. The dangerous airbags have already forced the recall of 14 million vehicles from 11 manufacturers around the world. In the United States, a recall that has been limited to humid regions now will be extended across the country. Moisture apparently makes the components more likely to explode, spraying passengers with shrapnel. Hiroko Tabuchi in The New York Times .
Takata claims the recall will just make the problem worse. The manufacturer hasn't been able to provide enough spare parts to fix the problem, and thinks the federal government should focus on the regions where drivers are most at risk. Jeff Plungis, Jeff Green and Craig Trudell for Bloomberg .
The company is also under criminal investigation. Five deaths have been attributed to the defect, and a federal grand jury has issued a subpoena.  Reuters .
5. In case you missed it
Surveillance reform stalls in the Senate. A version of the bill passed by the House to restrain the NSA didn't beat a filibuster. Privacy advocates said the bill didn't go far enough, and Sen. Rand Paul joined the filibuster along with many Republicans who oppose any reform. Dustin Volz in National Journal .
DRUM: The filibuster wins! "Democrats blocked action to approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. A few minutes later, Republicans blocked a bill to regulate the bulk collection of phone records by the NSA. Both bills had majority support. Both failed thanks to filibusters."  Mother Jones .
Boehner finally found a lawyer for his suit against Obama, and he calls himself a liberal. Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington, agreed to take the case on a novel legal theory. Jason Millman in The Washington Post . 
BITTMAN: Science is yielding promising ideas for farming the Corn Belt. Incorporating a a few strips of land planted with indigenous prairie species in industrial fields can have a profoundly positive effect on soil and water, while adding to the farmer's bottom line.  The New York Times .

But all other euro zone borrowing costs fell, with benchmark German yields hitting a day's low after Nowotny said the bloc's tepid recovery had pushed the European Central Bank to look more closely at a sovereign bond quantitative easing program.
"Nowotny's comments have just reinforced the market's view that the ECB is inching towards outright QE, we think probably in January," said Lee Hardman, a strategist with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London.
DOLLAR POWER
The gathering strength of the dollar, against which the euro fell 0.2 percent to a 2-1/2-year low, also weighed heavily on emerging markets on Monday.
The rouble one of the headline losers, giving up 2 percent as it fell back towards record lows hit last week.
Symptomatic of problems affecting many developing markets, there are worries that Russia will jack up interest rates to as much as 12 percent this week in a bid to fend off a full-blown financial crisis.
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed down 0.25 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei was up 0.1 percent with the downward revision to Japan's GDP neutralizing much of the positive impact from a weaker yen. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.2 percent while Singaporean and Malaysian shares also dipped.
The Shanghai composite index gained 2.9 percent after the downbeat Chinese data added to hopes that China will implement more stimulus to shore up its economy.
Dariusz Kowalczyk, economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong, noted that the year-on-year drop in China's imports was the biggest since the Lehman crisis, barring the volatile Lunar New Year-related period.
"This is partly a reflection of lower commodity prices and base effects, but ...we have to assume that poor domestic demand has played a part. This means that pressure will rise on the government to do more to stimulate growth," he said.
The Australian and the New Zealand dollars, both sensitive to the economic fortunes of China, touched new 4-1/2 year and 2-1/2 year lows, respectively.
The disappointing Chinese and Japanese data contrasted sharply with Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls that showed employment in November surged by 321,000, easily topping forecasts for 230,000 new jobs.

Coal blocks auction likely to held in FebruaryCoal blocks auction likely to be held in February
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 19, 2014  | 20:50 IST
The keenly awaited auction of coal blocks will be held around February 11 but power tariffs are unlikely to shoot up following bidding, expected to be intense, as the government has put in place norms to regulate the bid war.
As per the draft rules of bidding for the first set coal blocks from among the 204 whose allocations were cancelled by the Supreme Court in September, the mines will be allocated only for specified end-use like power generation and there will be a cap on number of blocks a company can bid for.
"It is our endeavour that power tariff does not rise due to auction. We are in the process of evolving a system, which has not been finalised yet. It is not a revenue maximising process... It is essential to keep a lid on tariff," Coal Secretary Anil Swarup said unveiling the draft rules.
Swarup said the government will ensure that the blocks are not monopolised by one entity.
To avoid monopoly, a cap on the number of blocks a company can bid for will be put in place. The bid due date would be around February 11.
"We hope to finalise the technical bid qualification by March 3. The auction will get moving on March 6 and we hope that by March 16, we should be able to issue a vesting order," Coal Secretary Anil Swarup told reporters in New Delhi.
The government plans to auction 72 coal mines in the first lot. Of these, 42 are ones which are currently under production and where Supreme Court had allowed continuation of operation till March 31.
The remaining 32 are ones which are ready to produce. Request for proposal for these will be issued on December 22, 2014 and due date for technical bids is February 11.
Technical bids will be opened on March 3 and e-auction or price bidding will start on March 6. The government hopes to allocate the mines by March 16. The 42 producing mines currently produce about 90 million tons a year of coal and the remaining 32 ready-to-produce mine have potential of another 120 million tons.
Successful bidders, besides paying the winning price for the coal block, will also pay a fair value for the plant and equipment already installed at these mines. Existing operator of these mines will get the fair value of his investment but will not have first right of refusal or the right to match the best price, he said.

2G case: Court allows CBI plea to summon additionalwitnessesPrint
Examining the witnesses is essential to the just decision of the case as the movement of amount of Rs 200 crore would become more explicit and role of accused Kanimozhi Karunanidhi in the running of Kalaignar TV (P) Limited would also stand further clarified. (Source: PTI source)
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 8:39 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 8:52 pm
A special court on Wednesday allowed CBI plea to summon additional witnesses and for producing documents before it in 2G spectrum allocation scam trial, observing that it appeared to be “essential” for a just decision in the case. Special CBI Judge O P Saini, however, cautioned the agency that “fragmentary” filing of documents do cause anxiety and uncertainty in a trial and the prosecution should keep in mind that the Indian legal system does not cleave to be theory of “hound-the-accused-at-all-cost-by-all-means-fair-or-foul”.
“The prosecution is endeavouring to prove its existing case with the help of material which has come to its notice subsequently,” the judge said. “In this view of the matter, the examination of these witnesses appears to be essential to the just decision of the case as the movement of amount of Rs 200 crore would become more explicit and role of accused Kanimozhi Karunanidhi in the running of Kalaignar TV (P) Limited would also stand further clarified, amounting to proper proof of existing facts,” the court said.
The court, in its 36-page order, also said that allowing the CBI plea would be in the interest of both the accused as well as the prosecution and it would lead to a “just decision” of the case. It observed that it would not cause any prejudice to the accused and would rather help in determination of the truth.
Cautioning the CBI, the court said that in this case, the prosecution has been allowed to file documents 14 times while the accused has also not “lagged behind” as it has competed with the agency and has been allowed to file documents running into about eight full size steel boxes. “But prosecution should remember that Indian legal system does not cleave to be theory of hound-the-accused-at-all-cost-by-all-means-fair-or-foul.
An accused is also entitled to certain rights and to a fair trial. He is not a quarry to be pursued, caught and killed. He is deemed to be innocent until proved guilty and is entitled to a fair trial,” it said. The CBI had sought to summon Enforcement Directorate Deputy Director Rajeshwar Singh, its Assistant Director Satyendra Singh, Under Secretary in Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Navil Kapur and bank official D Mani.
Apart from these four persons, the agency had sought to recall General Manager (Finance) of Kalaignar TV (P) Ltd G Rajendran, who had earlier deposed as a witness in the case, for further examination besides continued…

What is Singapore model of a smart city and how much India can replicateitPrint

Why has been there so buzz around Singapore in terms of Narendra Modi government planning 100 smart cities? Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu has just returned from Singapore after discussing development of AP’s new state capital. His Telengana counterpart K Chandrashekhar Rao visited here earlier with idea of developing his port cities.
India talks of “smart cities” and Singapore Minister of State for foreign affairs Masagos Zulkifli said Singapore had started talking of becoming the “first smart nation” of the country with plans like underground expansion of the city and selective use of robotics to further curtail or enhance human efforts.
Right from coffee shops to Singaporeans with Indian roots to business bodies, there has been a definite buzz around India “breaking barriers”, as Zulkifli put it during his meeting with Indian journalists at a cafe on 14 June. With Singapore PM Lee Tsien Loong calling India a key regional player during recent Asean-India meet and Indian Pm Modi expected to attend Singapore’s 50th Independence Day celebrations next year, there is lot of expectancy around business bodies and individual entrepreneurs looking up to India as next big destination.
Talk to policy makers and city planners and this is what they mean by “a smart city” – a mix of urban town planning, multi-layer sewerage pipes with sensors to detect damage, integrated transport plan to charge less from commuters despite his long distance tours with change in mode of transport and increased focus on bicycling to reach metro rail stations rather than taking cars.
The traffic lights are automated and can decide its stopping seconds as per traffic load. A driver gets 24 points in a year and can lose his license after losing these points for traffic violation. A private contractor, who does not clear dirt near its site on public road, also loses his point for next contract.
“Policemen are hardly visible in Singapore. Yet, all follow rules. It is not about fear of law but about behaving yourself on road”, said Rashidy, a driver. Land Transport Authority Transport Gallery that shows how Singapore itself learnt about traffic management from best practices of the world from Boston, Tokyo and New York displays seven types of driving licences to regulate traffic. One such category is hazardous vehicles. The gallery in-charge talks alternative transport thinking to settle with public transport to minimise car use.
Singapore plans 900 km (10 km developed already) of sheltered cycling paths, something that can be replicated in India. These cycling paths cannot be used by bikers. Bike-sharing scheme, introduced in Singapore, can be easily followed in India to travel to offices on same route.
For easy traffic flow monitoring, Singapore has introduced over 600 Junction eyes to monitor its traffic movement and there is also parking guiding scheme in place to ensure vehicles do not clog at parking places when there are not enough spaces. To ensure pedestrian road safety, road engineering measures such as pedestrian crossing lines with enhanced dash markings and your speed monitoring system.

CM Fadnaviss decision to streamline coal supply generates 1 700 MPpowerDevendra Fadnavis.
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Posted: November 19, 2014 8:24 pm
The state government has taken the decision to increase the power supply to 40 lakh farmers across Maharashtra following streamlining of coal supply that helped to generate additional 1700 MW electricity. At present the power consumption in state is recorded at 14,000 MW.
Several parts of Maharashtra which still faces power cuts due to shortage of electricity will now get some relief. As a single decision to ensure timely delivery of coal supply which often lead to break down in functioning of the power plants will help to cut down load shedding by three hours. On an average the load shedding in state extends upto six to seven hours.
The chief minister Devendra Fadnavis ten days ago held a meeting with union minister for coal and energy Piyush Goyal to tackle the  shortage of coal supply that had adversely affected the working of the power plants across state.
The subsequent meetings between centre-state and its follow- up within a short span has ensured streamlining of coal supply thus  generating additional 1,700 MW electricity. It benefits more than 40 lakh farmers in state. Officials in ministry confirmed, “ Apart from the sustained coal supply, there was huge communcation gap between the orders given and coal rakes delivery to the power plants. The gap often marred the functioning of the power plants and affected the electricity supply.”
According to a senior officer in ministry of coal and power, “ We supply seven hours power in the day for a week. And alternative week we supply eight hours power at night.” From today, “ We have increased the power supply in day from seven to eight hours. And power supply at night has been increased from eight hours to ten hours.”
The Fadnavis government has been emphatically stating that tackling power crisis in state remains the most challenging as it affects both urban and rural Maharashtra.
Fadnavis who took the charge of the government on October 31, convened the meeting with union minister and top officials of state and centre to address the coal shortage that has lead to panic.
As the first step forward he has urged the officials to identify the hurdles that come in the way sustained coal supply to existing power
plants. The directives from the state government was they should make optimum use of the available domestic coal supply to the power plats to increase its efficiency. Admitting that most the plants were functioning only 60 to 65 per cent thus affecting both electricity generation and also the administrative cost of running the unit. As a result the end affect was higher power rates in state compared to neighbouring states like Gujarat , Chattisgarh or Madhya Pradesh.

Target surprises Wall Street
Obama to speak Friday in Las Vegas as he readies new immigration policyThe White House posted a video on its Facebook page Wednesday in which President Obama invited Americans to watch his immigration reform announcement on Thursday evening at 8 p.m. (The White House)
This post has been updated.
President Obama said in a video that he will lay out his proposal to overhaul the nation's immigration system Thursday and will travel to Las Vegas on the heels of that announcement to rally support for his initiative on Friday.
"Tomorrow night I'm going to be announcing here from the White House some steps I can take to start fixing our broken immigration system," Obama said in a video posted on Facebook Wednesday afternoon.
"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken. Unfortunately Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long," Obama said. "So what' I'm going to be laying out is the things I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.
According to a senior Democrat familiar with the plans, Obama will announce on Thursday that he is providing temporary protections to up to 5 million undocumented immigrants. His orders will make up to 4 million undocumented immigrants eligible for temporary protective status and provide relief to another 1 million through other means.
In a blow to activists advocating on behalf of young immigrant families, there will be no guaranteed protections for the parents of so-called “Dreamers,” -- children protected by Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program – nor for immigrant agricultural workers, said the Democrat, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
Congress will receive official details on the move Thursday, according to a senior Democratic Party official.
Obama said he will travel to Del Sol High School in Las Vegas Friday, where he will discuss and rally support for his plan.
Advocates began readying events to promote the administration’s immigration policy.
“We hear there will be a prime time Thursday evening announcement (to preview) and full unveiling in Vegas on Friday,” immigration advocate Dawn Le told other activists in an e-mail, which was later inadvertently sent to a group of reporters Wednesday morning. “Can folks begin to work and plan watch parties for Thursday and/or Friday? Unclear whether Thursday night content will be what is "celebratory," but Friday will be where we need a lot of energy guaranteed.”

Obama launched his push for immigration reform in January 2013 in Las Vegas, outlining a plan that would allow many of the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants to earn citizenship.
The president's decision to speak at the city's Del Sol High School highlights the administration's intensified push to convince Latinos that the Democratic Party is committed to addressing the dilemma of millions of undocumented immigrants . Obama is preparing to use his executive authority to expand temporary protections to millions of these individuals, as well as to broaden visa programs for highly skilled technology workers and perhaps also stiffen security along the U.S.-Mexico border.
During an appearance at the National Press Club Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Obama will announce "in the coming days ... [a] set of comprehensive reforms, within our existing legal authorities, to fix our broken immigration system."
He did not specify the actions Obama will take but did say they will include steps to further secure the southwestern border of the United States. Administration lawyers have concluded that executive action on the issue is legal and within the president's authority, he said, despite intense opposition from Republicans.
"Legislative action is always preferable," Johnson said. "But we have waited for Congress to act, and the Congress has not acted. The president has waited."
Johnson said the administration has concluded it has "wide latitude" to take action. "It can't be that we're not allowed to lift a finger to fix our broken immigration system," he said. "And we will."
Congressional Republicans have warned Obama that he risks undermining the prospects for cooperation on legislation in the final two years of his presidency if he takes action on immigration.
The decision to speak in Las Vegas could also bolster the political standing of Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who said in an interview with Univision on Tuesday that when it came to expanding protections for undocumented immigrants, "I think it should be done now."
Ali Noorani , executive director of the National Immigration Forum , wrote in an e-mail that even as Obama acted on his own to break the stalemate on the issue, Republicans would still have a chance to legislate.
“While executive action is not ideal, it accomplishes four things: Stabilizes our workforce, prioritizes law enforcement, protects families and puts congressional Republicans in the driver’s seat going into 2015," Noorani wrote. "They have an incredible opportunity to get credit for fixing America’s immigration system.”
With Obama likely on the verge of making an announcement, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the soon-to-be majority leader, expressed confidence Wednesday that congressional Republicans will extend funding for the federal government, which is set to expire next month, even if the president moves to overhaul the immigration system and some conservatives call for a spending showdown.
But in a sign that GOP strategy is still being formulated, McConnell did not specify the framework and length of possible funding legislation. Republican leaders in the House and Senate are still mulling a variety of options, all while hoping to avoid a politically damaging shutdown.
“We have two goals here at the end of the session: fund the government and avoid retroactive tax increases. I’m confident that we’ll do both,” McConnell said in a brief exchange at the U.S. Capitol.
Other congressional Republicans warned again that Obama risks his relationship with a GOP-controlled Capitol Hill if he acts.
“If ‘Emperor Obama’ ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his Constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for Congressional action on this issue -- and many others,” Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), said in an e-mail.
In an effort to cast doubts on the legality of Obama’s decision, GOP aides have been circulating a list of 22 times the president has said publicly that he doesn’t believe he has the authority to act through executive action to change immigration laws.

Alaska has spent more than $100 000 defending its same-sex marriage banThe Alaska State Capitol Building in Juneau ( by Jay Galvin from Pleasanton, CA )
Alaska has spent more than $100,000 so far defending a lawsuit against the state’s ban on marriage for same-sex couples, according to Department of Law figures obtained by the Alaska Dispatch News .
The state has spent $92,621.43 on attorneys and paralegal costs to defend Hamby v. Parnell, a lawsuit challenging Alaska’s marriage ban. U.S. District Judge Timothy Burgess ruled against the ban in October.
The state also spent $9,600 for outside counsel and $1,000 for other costs, the Alaska Dispatch News reported.
It’s estimated  about 74 same-sex couples  have been married in Alaska since the marriage ban was struck down on Oct. 12, or about one-fifth of all marriages performed in the state in that period. The cost to defend the ban amounts to almost $1,400 per couple.
The plaintiffs in the case also asked for $258,938.40, which if awarded, would increase the cost to the state to more than $360,000.

NSA bill hinders our intelligence community  say GOP hawksBy Jennifer Rubin November 19 Follow @JRubinBlogger
The Senate ended a good old, policy fight on intelligence gathering when it failed to invoke cloture  on a National Security Agency reform bill on Tuesday night. It was an early indicator as to which way the GOP is leaning on national security.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) (Alex Wong/Getty Images)
In contrast to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) , who thought the measure to “reform” the NSA surveillance program did not go far enough in hamstringing intelligence agencies, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who linked arms with Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) to sponsor the bill, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) took a traditional, pro-defense conservative position. In a statement released on Tuesday , he argued:
I cannot support the proposed changes to America’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The changes being proposed seem to be a reaction to misinformation and alarmism not rooted in the reality of our important counter-terrorism and surveillance programs, which have kept Americans safe and prevented another 9/11 attack on our shores for more than fourteen years. This legislation will weaken our ability to protect Americans by severely degrading our ability to identify and disrupt terrorists plots against the U.S. and our allies.
As the rise of ISIL has demonstrated, the world is as dangerous as ever, and extremists are being cultivated and recruited right here at home. This legislation would significantly weaken and, in some cases, entirely do away with some of the most important counter-terrorism capabilities at our disposal, which is why I will not support it.
That will be a powerful argument in his favor should he run for president in 2016: He understands who the enemy is and how surveillance works. He refuses to be buffaloed into fixing a program that is not broken in order to mollify talk show hosts and radical libertarians.
Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was likewise forceful in a speech on the Senate floor, denouncing  “the legislation offered by the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee that would end one of our nation’s critical capabilities to gather significant intelligence on terrorist threats.” In language that may get cited back to reckless advocates of NSA restrictions, he explained :
Most damagingly, it would hinder the ability of intelligence community analysts to query a database to determine links between potential terrorists. Instead, the Leahy bill would have this data be held by telephone companies, and it would make it far harder for records to be gathered for a specific selection term. Under the Leahy bill, the telephone companies would face no statutory requirement to even hold the relevant data. There is a legitimate debate to be had over the proper balances to strike in our democracy. We continue to have it. We should. But the opponents of this collection program have not provided any examples of the National Security Agency intentionally spying on innocent civilians. In fact the NSA, the courts and the Congress have put in place detailed oversight procedures to protect both privacy and national security.
Moreover, the only data captured under this program is the telephone number dialed, the number from which the call was made and the length of the call. Under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the content of the call is not captured. . . .
We live in a dangerous world. Threats like ISIL only make it more so. And at a moment when the United States is conducting a military campaign to disrupt, dismantle and defeat ISIL, now is not the time to be considering legislation that takes away the exact tools we need to combat ISIL. Our intelligence community is working to track foreign fighters returning from fighting in Syria, to prevent others from travelling to the battlefield, and to keep those within Syria from radicalizing their friends and family back home. It makes little sense to pass legislation that hinders our intelligence community — legislation that has yet to receive any committee consideration.
Indeed, Republicans who supported the bill, or worse alone co-sponsored it, will have plenty to answer for when they face voters. You do have to wonder whether GOP support for the Leahy bill, such as it was (a total of four voted for cloture), was based on the premise that conservative voters are too stupid to understand how the program works and why it is necessary. Or maybe the lawmakers who supported it just don’t get it.

Morning Plum: Federalist Society members says action on deportations is legalBy Greg Sargent November 19 Follow @theplumlinegs
With Republicans set to wage an epic showdown against President Obama’s expected executive action to shield millions from deportation — an action they claim will unleash Constitutional Armageddon — even members of one of the most influential conservative legal organizations in the country are now acknowledging his action is legal.
Sam Stein reports that senior lawyers at the annual convention of the Federalist Society entered into a spirited discussion in which panelists effectively acknowledged the President’s authority to act in this arena:
“I think the roots of prosecutorial discretion are extremely deep,” said Christopher Schroeder, the Charles S. Murphy Professor of Law and Public Policy Studies at Duke Law School. “The practice is long and robust. The case law is robust. Let me put it this way: Suppose some president came to me and asked me in the office of legal counsel, ‘Is it okay for me to go ahead an defer the deportation proceedings of childhood arrival?’ Under the present state of the law, I think that would be an easy opinion to write. Yes.”
Schroeder was speaking specifically about the deferred action program that Obama already has put into place — the one affecting so-called Dreamers who were brought to the U.S. as children. But later, Schroeder expanded his legal reasoning.
“I don’t know where in the Constitution there is a rule that if the president’s enactment affects too many people, he’s violating the Constitution,” Schroeder said. “There is a difference between executing the law and making the law. But in the world in which we operate, that distinction is a lot more problematic than you would think. If the Congress has enacted a statute that grants discretionary authority for the administrative agency or the president to fill in the gaps, to write the regulations that actually make the statute operative, those regulations to all intents and purposes make the law.”
Schroeder is not a conservative, but Stein reports that other panelists “by and large” agreed with his points. And the notion that the large number of people affected by this action doesn’t necessarily make it illegal is important. As I noted yesterday , while Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and Obama’s coming proposal, are rooted in law and precedent, they do go further than pretty much anything attempted before in scope and scale. Critics will rely heavily on this to further the impression that this just feels like we’re crossing into lawlessness. But that doesn’t make it true, as the above law professor notes.  And on this point, he’s in agreement with many liberal legal experts .
The idea that Congress created the statute that left the president with the authority to exercise broad enforcement discretion is also key. And at the Federalist Society convention, another legal scholar, one who agreed with Schroeder but also accused Obama of “destabilizing the republic,” added: “If Congress wants to restrain the discretion of the president, they are supposed to do what the separation of powers encourages them to do: Write the statute tightly so that it will be actually administered the way you want it administered.”
Translation: Congress effectively gave the president the authority to do what he is about to do; if Congress wants, it can move to take that authority away.
And indeed, this is exactly what Congress very well may attempt. When Republicans take control in January, they will likely try to pass measures rolling back Obama’s authority to shield large classes from deportation. That’s what they should do. The rub, though, is that many conservatives will demand they go farther, by staging government funding fights to roll back Obama’s actions that could result in a government shutdown.
GOP leaders reportedly don’t want to go this far. But, even if some right-leaning legal scholars understand that this latest move is legal, GOP base voters have been told by their leaders for years that Obama is hell bent on shredding the Constitution. In some areas, Obama certainly has overreached in ways that history should judge harshly. But GOP rhetoric on this topic has been way over the top and even Apocalyptic in the face of all sorts of Obama initiatives. If base voters think GOP leaders should mount maximum resistance to what they are describing as his latest act of supreme lawlessness, who’s to blame them? The result is that even if GOP leaders want to avoid government funding fights, they may not have any choice.
**********************************************************
UPDATE: I should have clarified that Christopher Schroeder, who supplied the remarks I block-quoted above, is not a conservative. But other members of the Federalist Society panel agreed with him. The second lawyer I quoted on the fact that Congress should clarify Obama’s authority if it doesn’t like this action, who also agreed with Schroeder, also accused Obama of “destabilizing the republic.”
Also, Stein did note that these lawyers weren’t necessarily speaking for the Federalist Society. But as Stein reported: “by and large, the panelists agreed the president has wide legal latitude to prioritize and shape deportation laws.”
I’ve edited the above to clarify these points.
**************************************************************
* EXPERTS: OBAMA’S EXECUTIVE ACTION IS LEGAL: Law professors Erwin Chemerinsky and Sam Kleiner have a good piece running through the legal basis for executive action to defer the deportation of large classes of people and the history of such actions by previous presidents .
One key nugget: This has historically been applied for humanitarian reasons, which may be the justification for Obama’s action deferring the deportation of parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents: To prevent the breakup of families.
* MAP OF THE DAY: Related to the above: Aaron Blake brings us a map that shows that many, many states are home to children in high school and younger who have at least one parent who is an undocumented immigrant . The precise impact Obama’s action on all of these people is unknown, but as Blake notes, this shows that a whole lot of children have a stake in that action; it’s not only about illegal immigrants.
* WHITE HOUSE LOWERS EXPECTATIONS: The Hill reports that administration officials are privately letting immigration advocates know that Obama’s executive action may not shield as many people from deportation as they had hoped.  This raises two questions: First, how will Obama justify extending deportation relief to the parents of legal children but not to the parents of DREAMers?
Second, will advocates disappointed by the scope of his action nonetheless rally behind him for the brutal political fight to come?
* KEYSTONE VOTE SHOWS SPLIT AMONG DEMS: In a victory for the environmental movement, Senate Democrats blocked the Keystone pipeline last night, after Mary Landrieu failed to secure enough Dems to pass it for the good of her reelection chances . The Times observes:
Tuesday’s vote exposed to public view some of the contours and rifts in the Democratic Party, where many senators feel they have too often bent over backward to accommodate Ms. Landrieu…They finally revolted, in what they said was a vote of principle against legislation they believe would harm the environment. Throughout her Senate career, Ms. Landrieu, a moderate who was known as the oil industry’s best friend in the Democratic Party, has clashed with the liberal environmental wing of her party.
Fourteen Dems voted for Keystone, but all others opposed it. The environment and climate change are increasingly a priority for the Democratic Party overall, and as such could matter politically in 2016, but divisions clearly remain.
* REPUBLICANS USED TO WANT TO SOLVE IMMIGRATION: The Dem-aligned Americans United for Change has released a new Web video contrasting John Boehner’s 2013 claims that he really, truly wants to address our immigration crisis with his current vow to fight “tooth and nail” against anything Obama does unilaterally to accomplish that. With a major fight looming, a key component of the Dem message will be that Republicans simply refuse to solve a problem they themselves have said must be solved.
* GOP BLOCKS REFORM OF NSA BULK SURVEILLANCE: Last night Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic bill to end bulk surveillance by the National Security Agency and reform spying practices more generally:
Just four Republicans joined Democrats to advance the bill: Ted Cruz of Texas, Dean Heller of Nevada, Mike Lee of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Bill Nelson of Florida was the only Democrat to vote against cloture…Rand Paul, voted against the bill because it didn’t go far enough in his opinion to roll back surveillance under the Patriot Act.
So much for the rise of libertarianism in the GOP…
* GOP STILL FACES BIG GENDER GAP: Scott Bland has a fascinating look at what really happened in the last election, by the numbers . One notable event was the epic collapse of Democrats in the south. There’s also this:
Republicans won male voters 57 percent to 41 percent in the 2014 elections, a whopping 16-point margin, according to the exit polls . That’s slightly better than the GOP did among men even during the 2010 wave election. But Democrats also improved among female voters compared with four years ago, carrying women by a 4-point margin, 51 percent to 47 percent. That 20-point gender gap between men’s support for Republicans and women’s support for Democrats is the largest recorded in the national House exit poll in two decades.
It’s true that the Democrats’ “war on women” strategy fell short in key races. But the broader continuing advantage Democrats have among women is also important and could have major ramifications going forward into 2016.

A cracked rail is causing delays on Metros Orange LineBy Dana Hedgpeth November 19 Follow @postmetrogirl
Updated at 11:20 a.m.
Metro said trains are no longer sharing a track on the Orange Line. There was an earlier cracked rail outside the East Falls Church stop that caused delays for riders on the Orange, Blue and Silver lines.
Metro warned that riders should expect residual delays to continue in both directions. It was unclear how long those delays would last.
Updated at 11:02 a.m.
Metro said a cracked rail is causing delays for riders on three of its lines in Northern Virginia.
The cracked rail is on the Orange and Silver lines between the East Falls Church and West Falls Church stops.
“There are trains holding and waiting to pass through the Rosslyn [Tunnel],” said Morgan Dye, a spokeswoman for Metro. That means there are also delays on the Blue Line.
She said crews are working to repair the cracked rail and did not know when the repairs would be complete and service back to normal.
For now, trains are continuing to share a track between the East Falls Church and West Falls Church stations and between East Falls Church and McLean stops.
Just after 11 a.m., Metro said in a twitter message that delays continued on all three lines, as trains between East and West Falls Church shared a track.

There is a cracked rail on the Orange and Silver lines between the East Falls Church and West Falls Church stops.
Trains are sharing a track between the two stations and between the East Falls Church and McLean stops. Crews are on the scene. It is not clear how long the single-tracking will last, according to Metro officials.
Metro said it was not immediately clear if the cracked rail was caused by the cold weather.

Nationals release catcher Jhonatan SolanoBy James Wagner November 19 Follow @jameswagnerwp
Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP
Late Tuesday night, the Nationals released catcher Jhonatan Solano, who served as depth at Class AAA Syracuse. Solano, 29, was out of options and the Nationals faced a roster crunch ahead of Thursday’s deadline to add players to the 40-man roster to protect them from December’s Rule 5 draft.
Solano, whose nickname is “The Onion,” saw action in 36 total major league games between 2012 and 2013, hitting .217 with two home runs. The native Colombian spent the season at Class AAA Syracuse, hitting .251/.305/.388 with a career-high 10 home runs but wasn’t called up at any point. He was a first half all-star at Syracuse.
With Solano’s departure, the Nationals will likely lean on Sandy Leon as the third-string backup to Wilson Ramos and Jose Lobaton. Leon, however, is also out of options.
The Nationals’ 40-man roster now has 38 players.

Transparency in the Michael Brown investigationBy Paul Cassell November 19
With a grand jury decision imminent in the Michael Brown case, the issue of transparency has arisen. It appears to be widely (although not universally) assumed that the grand jury will not return any charges against Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson for shooting and killing Brown. Some persons sympathetic to the filing of charges have argued that this procedure is not “transparent.”   Part of the argument is that grand jury proceedings are typically kept secret — and it is expected that this proceeding will be no different.  But this claim overlooks the possibility that grand jury information can be released to the public.  And, indeed, the prosecutor supervising the Michael Brown grand jury has promised (in the event that no charges are filed) to try and make the grand jury information public as soon as possible.  This procedure will make the investigation more transparent than just about any other criminal case.
I have some sympathy with those who are arguing for transparency.  No less than other government officials, police officers should expect to be scrutinized when they take actions in the line of duty — particularly the use of deadly force.  But I don’t see any necessary inconsistency between the use of the Missouri grand jury procedure and transparency.
Several weeks ago, Bob McCulloch (the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney supervising the grand jury) issued a little-discussed news release , promising that if the grand jury decides not to charge, he will then seek to have the grand jury’s information made publicly available:  “If the grand jury does not return an indictment, then I will ask the court to order that the evidence be released to the public as soon as possible if not immediately.”  (McCulloch has also pointed out that if the grand jury makes a decision to return charges, no such motion will be required because the facts will naturally emerge during the criminal trial.)
Although the news release does not discuss the legal basis for a prosecutor’s motion to release grand jury information, Missouri law appears to authorize such release for good cause shown.  So far as I can determine, Missouri appellate courts have not decided any recent cases on releasing grand jury information.  But a treatise on Missouri criminal practice and procedure (written by former magistrate judge William A. Knox and updated through December 2013) reports that “[a]lthough disclosure of the deliberation and votes of the grand jury is barred by the statute, court decisions have indicated the disclosure of other matters is permitted in the exercise of the court’s discretion.”  19 Mo. Prac., Criminal Practice & Procedure § 12:10 (3d ed.).  As support for this proposition, the treatise cites two cases: State ex rel. Clagett v. James, 327 S.W.2d 278 (Mo. banc 1959), and Mannon v. Frick, 365 Mo. 1203, 295 S.W.2d 158 (1956).  These cases involved requests by criminal defendants to obtain grand jury materials to prepare a defense.  But the legal principle these cases announced is that grand jury information can be released if an appropriate basis for breaching grand jury secrecy is shown.
Good cause for breaching grand jury secrecy in this case should be easy to establish.  According to the Mannon decision, Missouri grand jury proceedings are typically kept secret “to protect the [grand] jurors themselves; to promote a complete freedom of disclosure; to prevent the escape of a person indicted before he may be arrested; to prevent the subornation of perjury in an effort to disprove facts there testified to; and to protect the reputations of persons against whom no indictment may be found.”   None of these goals would be defeated by release of the information gathered by the Michael Brown grand jury.  For example, with regard to protecting the grand jurors:  The identity of the grand jurors has not been released to the public and, in any event, if the grand jury does not indict, it would likely promote their safety to have the basis for their (presumably reasoned decision) publicly released.  With regard to preventing subornation of perjury: The secrecy of the grand jury thus far in the process has presumably provided the necessary safeguard.    And with regard to protecting Officer Wilson’s reputation: presumably his reputation will be protected more by the release of the information than by its non-disclosure.
It is hard to imagine a court turning down McCulloch’s request to release the grand jury information.  This will make the Michael Brown shooting investigation far more “transparent” than just about any other high-profile criminal investigation.  This should be celebrated as a good thing, as we will soon know the facts.  But, sadly, it appears that the facts are not really of interest to at least some of Michael Brown’s supporters.

Convicted sex offenders  Jehovahs Witnesses  and the First AmendmentBy David Post November 19
Beginning in the 1930s, shortly after the Supreme Court had “incorporated” the First Amendment into the due process clause (thereby making it an enforceable constraint not only on the federal government ["Congress shall make no law . . ."] but on State and municipal governments as well) the Jehovah’s Witnesses went on a campaign to attack, in court, restrictions on their ability to proselytize door-to-door and to give voice to unpopular views. During one particular 8 year period (1938 to 1946) they brought no fewer than 23 separate First Amendment actions to the Supreme Court (prompting Justice Stone to quip that they “ought to have an endowment in view of the aid they give in solving the legal problems of civil liberties”).  They won some spectacularly important victories – West Virginia Board of Ed. v Barnette (1943) (children cannot be forced to recite the Pledge of Allegiance or salute the flag), Chaplinsky v New Hampshire (19420 (establishing the “fighting words” doctrine, and overturning conviction of a Jehovah’s Witness who called a local official a “damned racketeer” and a “fascist”), Watchtower Society v. Village of Stratton (2002) (overturning municipal ordinance requiring government permits for all door-to-door advocacy).***
They were widely reviled – especially during World War II and the Korean War, their position as conscientious objectors to military service and their refusal to salute the flag made them the object of great hostility – but in retrospect, we all owe them a great debt of gratitude.  It took (and it takes) real courage to stand up to the combined forces of public opinion and the state to voice opinions that others find highly objectionable and even inflammatory, and we all enjoy, in a much stronger First Amendment than we might otherwise have, the benefits of their having had the courage to have done so.
Yesterday the 9th Circuit issued its decision striking down California’s CASE (Californians Against Sexual Exploitation) Act as violative of the First Amendment.  The Act required previously-convicted sex offenders to provide “[a] list of any and all Internet identifiers established or used,” a “list of any and all Internet service providers used,” and to send written notice to law enforcement within 24 hours of adding or changing an Internet identifier or an account with an Internet service provider; it also provided for fairly severe criminal penalties for non-compliance.
This is the latest in what is becoming a large series of cases involving First Amendment challenges to state sex offender registration statutes. There have been cases like this one in Nebraska, Indiana, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, to name a few.   I’ve blogged about some of them before – e.g.,  here  and here – and (full disclosure) I’ve been involved in several of them (including this California case) as an expert testifying on behalf of the challengers.
The court’s opinion here – at least to someone on the side of the fence that I’m on – has a terrific analysis of the First Amendment issues at stake, and some strong First-Amendment-protective language that will, I promise you, come in very, very handy in future battles – the ones that are coming that will not involve just convicted sex offenders.  The court struck down the statute on the grounds that it “unnecessarily chills protected speech” in three ways: the” Act does not make clear what it is that sex offenders are required to report, there are insufficient safeguards preventing the public release of the information sex offenders do report, and the 24-hour reporting requirement is onerous and overbroad.”  There is, in particular, some very forceful language about the right, under the First Amendment, to speak anonymously – an issue that, as I keep harping on , is going to be a major First Amendment battleground during the the next decade or so.    The court wrote:
Although this is not what some might call the classic anonymous-speech case, where speakers allege they are required to disclose their identities directly to their audience, we conclude that the Act nevertheless chills anonymous speech because it too freely allows law enforcement to disclose sex offenders’ Internet identifying information to the public. . . . We agree with the district court that the standards for releasing Internet identifying information to the public are inadequate to constrain the discretion of law enforcement agencies and that, as a result, registered sex offenders are unnecessarily deterred from engaging in anonymous online speech.
[S]ex offenders’ fear of disclosure in and of itself chills their speech. If their identity is exposed, their speech, even on topics of public importance, could subject them to harassment, retaliation, and intimidation. See McIntyre, 514 U.S. at 341–42 (“The decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to preserve as much of one’s privacy as possible.”); Brown v. Socialist Workers ’74 Campaign Comm. (Ohio), 459 U.S. 87, 100 (1982) (holding that disclosure requirements may subject unpopular minority groups to “threats, harassment, and reprisals”). Anonymity may also be important to sex offenders engaged in protected speech because it “provides a way for a writer who may be personally unpopular to ensure that readers will not prejudge her message simply because they do not like its proponent.”
Pretty strong stuff.  It has made me think about the Jehovah’s Witnesses.  Convicted sex offenders are probably one of a very small number of groups that are even more despised than the Jehovah’s Witnesses were in the Thirties and Forties, and they have consequently been singled out for very harsh treatment in the law.  Fighting back, they’re helping to make some good First Amendment precedent, and when the government starts cracking down on other speech by other speakers, or attempting to restrict our ability to use anonymizing tools in our Internet communications – as it will –  we’ll be grateful to them for having done so.
***Shawn Peters’ excellent “Judging Jehovah’s Witnessess” tells this story in great detail, if you’re interested.
***************
UPDATE:  A number of the comments, and several communications I received directly from readers, have pointed to some serious criticisms of the Jehovah’s Witnesses (regarding possible sex abuse claims, indoctrination attempts, and the like).  Just to be clear:  I have no particular position on any of that; I’m not trying to excuse anything they may or may not have done, nor do I have any particular information about their internal practices.  My column was certainly not trying to suggest otherwise.  My point in bringing them up was just that they have an important place in First Amendment history – a place I think is secure, irrespective of who they are or what they represent or how they behave.

The Buffalo lake effect storm turns deadly as snow keeps fallingBy Abby Ohlheiser November 19 Follow @abbyohlheiser

An extreme lake effect storm has dumped as much as 65  inches of snow just south of Buffalo, N.Y. The monster storm has resulted in at least six deaths in the area, where drivers remain stranded, transportation has been frozen to a halt, and — unfortunately — snow is expected to keep falling until Friday.
Officials are bracing for as many as 2 additional feet of snow in some portions of the Buffalo area on Thursday, as forecasters predict yet another likely lake effect storm.
According to the Buffalo News , two people died while trying to shovel their way out of the heavy snow, possibly from heart problems. A 46-year-old man was found dead in his car, which was buried in snow. Another person was killed when he was pinned while attempting to free a vehicle that was stuck in the snow, according to the NBC affiliate, WGRZ . A fifth person died under unspecified circumstances, also from a heart problem. And a county employee in Genesee County reportedly died while clearing snow outside of the sheriff’s office. (The brutal weather was also blamed for deaths in Michigan and New Hampshire, according to the Associated Press.)
Massive mounds of snow are piling up in western New York. More than four feet of snow fell in parts of Buffalo on Tuesday, while a second storm is expected Thursday. Temperatures dropped below freezing from coast to coast. (AP)
The lake effect wall of snow left wildly varying snow totals across the region: one side of Cheektowaga, N.Y., had at least 51 inches of snow Tuesday; the other side of town recorded just 2 inches.
Where the snow fell hard, officials struggled to free trapped drivers. A bus carrying the Niagara University women’s basketball team was trapped on I-90 for more than 24 hours .
“It was a little scary,” Emily Granruth, a 19-year-old guard for the team, told The Post in an overnight telephone from inside the bus. “We didn’t know what was going on.”
The bus was eventually freed and the team resumed its ride home Wednesday morning.

The polls are clear: Younger Republicans support action on climate changeBy Chris Mooney , Scott Clement and Steven Mufson November 19 Follow chriscmooney Follow @sfcpoll Follow @StevenMufson
(REUTERS/Carlos Barria)
Congressional Republicans want to make fighting the Environmental Protection Agency's climate regulations and President Obama's greenhouse gas reduction targets a centerpiece of their agenda over next two years -- now that they have wrested control of the Senate as well as House.
But how will the politics of that look 10 years from now?
Several commentators have suggested that climate change could become the gay marriage issue of the future for the GOP. In other words, demographic changes within the Republican Party itself and in society in general could leave GOP leaders looking badly out of step with their own constituency and scrambling to switch sides.
Over the past decade, support for gay marriage has grown within the Republican Party, especially as young Republicans grew older and swelled the ranks of the party. Opposition to gay marriage -- and the party's support for a slew of state ballot initiatives banning gay marriage -- may have looked mainstream with the Republican Party 10 years ago, but now looks outdated. "The ballot initiative wins masked the rapidly rising tide of gay acceptance fueled by younger generations," wrote Bill Scher of the Campaign for America's Future, who likens the issue to climate change.
Will the climate change issue really follow the same course? To test that theory, we looked more closely at the data from a series of global warming questions asked by the Washington Post-ABC News poll back in June. In particular, that poll asked a nationally representative sample of respondents whether they believed the federal government "should or should not limit the release of greenhouse gases from existing power plants in an effort to reduce global warming?"
People overwhelmingly supported this idea of doing so, with 70 percent in favor.
Then, a subsequent question asked, "What if that significantly lowered greenhouse gases but raised your monthly energy expenses by 20 dollars a month - in that case do you think the government should or should not limit the release of greenhouse gases?"
This is a harder test, but once again, a majority (63 percent) was willing to spend $ 20 per month to limit greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, although they are more resistant than Democrats and Independents, even a slight majority of Republicans concur:
Support for action to slow climate change (even if it costs something) was also much more widespread among younger voters in the poll. As they become increasingly central to the electorate, the GOP war against the EPA's climate regulations could look shortsighted:
The age gap here is quite significant -- those under 30 are 22 percentage points more supportive than seniors (65+) of government limits on greenhouse gases if they add $20 to their monthly energy bill. It's worth noting that majorities in all age groups supported this in the poll. The age gap on climate is about half the size of the age gap on same-sex marriage -- in the same survey, those under 30 were 39 points more supportive of gay marriage than seniors (77 vs. 38 percent).
The key question, though, is whether even within the GOP, there is a split between younger and older voters on climate change. Sure enough, our poll suggests that this is the case:
What this shows is that age matters above and beyond partisanship in how people think about the climate issue. Roughly six in 10 Republicans and GOP-leaning independents under age 50 think the government should limit greenhouse gases even if it causes a $20 increase in their monthly bill; fewer than half of Republicans ages 50-64 or over 65 support this policy. Support is only slightly higher among Democrats under age 50 than those over age 65, which is statistically insignificant. Support does rise to 78 percent among Democrats under age 40.
It is worth noting that a post-election Pew Research Center poll also showed an age gap among Republicans, albeit smaller than the Post-ABC survey. A 56 percent majority of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents under age 40 supported "setting stricter limits on power plants in order to address climate change," compared with 44 percent of Republicans over age 50, according to breakdowns provided to the Washington Post.
Where does that leave the Republican leadership? Earlier this month, after China and the United States made historic commitments to curtail greenhouse gases, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kty.) took aim at what he called "the President’s ideological War on Coal." House Speaker John Boehner bemoaned "the latest example of the president’s crusade against affordable, reliable energy that is already hurting jobs and squeezing middle-class families.”
They clearly think this is a politically winning line of attack. But as ocean waters rise with climate change, a sea change at work within the GOP may one day wash away today's Republican strategy.

Help Bihar  or will not let enter here: Manjhi s stern warning to Central ministers from stateManjhi said the state government had laid a target to construct two crore toilets by 2019.
Patna | Posted: November 19, 2014 4:17 pm | Updated: November 20, 2014 2:19 am
In a fresh controversial remark, Bihar CM Jeetan Ram Manjhi on Wednesday said he would deny entry to seven Union ministers from the state, if they failed to bring desired assistance for the region.
“Satbhaiya ko Bihar nahi ghusne denge (Won’t allow the seven brothers to enter Bihar)”, Manjhi said as he accused the Centre of ignoring the state’s interests. The CM was speaking at a function on the occasion of ‘World Toilet Day’.  Though Manjhi did not take names, the seven ministers he referred to were Radha Mohan Singh, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan (cabinet ministers), Rajiv Pratap Rudy (MoS-Independent charge), Upendra Kushwaha, Ram Kripal Yadav and Giriraj Singh (all MoS).
The BJP sharply reacted to the CM’s statement, calling it “irresponsible”.
Meanwhile, in another bid to position himself as the Dalit face of JD(U), Manjhi said he became a CM in the course of his long struggle and he would not be surprised if he became Prime Minister someday through his struggle.
“Thokar khate khate CM ban gaye, kahi thokar mein PM na ban jaye. Hum Mahadalit thokar hi khate hain  (I have become CM after facing hardship, and might one day become Prime Minister also through the same struggle. We, Mahadalits, always have to face hardship).”
Manjhi recalled that while upper caste students were offered brooms to clean schools, lower caste ones were told to clean drains with bare hands.
Manjhi, who earlier termed upper caste “foreigners and descendants of Aryans”, is known for making controversial statements.
He recently said Scheduled Castes and OBCs constitute 65 per cent of the state’s population, and hence only they were “entitled to rule”.
The CM’s statements have embarrassed the JD(U) and its allies RJD and the Congress. Manjhi also met party leader Nitish Kumar twice in a month to “clarify his stand”.

Secure exit of about 15,000 followers from Satlok Ashram and arrest 450 people, including two of Rampal's close aides.
The Haryana Police on Wednesday closed in on self-styled godman Rampal after it secured the exit of about 15,000 of his followers from the Satlok Ashram in Barwala, Hisar. The police have also arrested 450 people, including two of his close aides and about 350 of the ashram `commandoes’, for violence against the State.
However, the violence has also taken its toll. While the bodies of four women were handed over the police by the ashram authorities, another woman and an infant died due to medical reasons.
The police which had suspended the operation last evening to allow people to come out of the Ashram, waited patiently for a large part of the day for the followers of Rampal to emerge from the Ashram. By evening about 2,000 people were still present in the ashram.
Simultaneously efforts were also being made to secure the surrender of Rampal and his core team of supporters even as the police with the help of Central Reserve Police Force prepared for a final round of assault, which many fear could be a bloody one as many of the godman’s followers are armed with guns, revolvers and pistols.
Earlier in the day, Director General of Police S.N. Vashisht had said the operation to bring the fugitive godman to book would continue till he is arrested and produced before the High Court, which had issued non bailable warrants against him.
Mr. Vashisht said it was around 10 last night that the first batch of followers of the godman began coming out of the Ashram. About 2,000 men came out in the first round and expressed their desire to go home. They were taken to railway stations and bus stands in Hisar and Jind by Haryana Police and Haryana Roadways buses. Subsequently through the night about 8,000 more people, including women, children and elderly who were being captive in the ashram for over a week, came out.
Most of the followers were from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and had come to Barwala for a four-day satsang which had started on November 6. The DGP said he was in touch with Delhi Police and Uttar Pradesh officials to ensure that there was no regrouping of Rampal’s followers.
The police made those coming out walk in a single file and through a group of spotters as it wanted to screen these people for the presence of some of Rampal’s followers engaged in Tuesday’s violence. So far about 270 people have been detained, 20 of them for actively participating in the violence. By late in the day the police had also arrested the spokesperson for the Satlok Ashram Raj Kapoor, Rampal’s close associate Purshottam Das and about 350 “commandoes” or private security personnel of the Ashram.
Stating that the Haryana police was committed to saving the lives of the innocent people, Mr. Vashisht said he was hopeful that the remaining 5,000 people in the ashram would also come out by this evening. Those involved in the violence have been booked for sedition, criminal conspiracy, illegal detention and rioting among other charges.
Mr. Vashisht said the operation was suspended last evening to enable the innocent women and children to come out and he was glad that the strategy worked as they did not want any casualties among this section. “The interviews of these people to the media in Hisar show that they were being kept in the ashram by Rampal’s men against their wishes.”
A large number of people coming out of the ashram said they had been locked up and detained by the “sewadars” or volunteers in the ashram. Many had also got separated from their family members during the stay in the ashram or while coming out of it.
The DGP said the culprits, who precipitated the crisis, would have to face the full force of law.
He also mentioned how six of the ashram inmates had died. “We were handed over bodies of four women by the Ashram authorities this morning and they have been sent for post-mortem.” Their post-mortem later confirmed that none of them had sustained external injuries.
These women have been identified as Savita, 31, of Delhi; Santosh, 45, of Rohtak in Haryana; Malkeet Kaur, 50, of Sangrur in Punjab; and Rajbala of Bijnore.
Mr. Vashisht asserted that there has been no firing by the police so far and the police has also not entered the Ashram premises. He said depending on the investigation, cases would be registered into these deaths.
This apart, the DGP said, at about 4 a.m. a woman inmate of the ashram, Rajni of Lalitpur in Uttar Pradesh was sent to a medical college at Agroha with a heart valve problem and later died there. Similarly, he said, a one-and-a-half year old child, Dhairya, of Rewa district of Madhya Pradesh, who had a condition of congenital jaundice, also died in the ashram.
Mr. Vashisht claimed that these two death appeared to be natural.
He said the operation at the 12-acre ashram would continue till Rampal’s arrest, who has now also been booked for sedition. He declared that no talks were possible with such a fugitive now and the only option available to Rampal was to surrender.
The DGP said the ashram inmates had not only used .315 bore guns and firearms but also acid bulbs and petrol bombs against the police. Besides, he said, the nearly 200 gas cylinders found stored in the ashram also posed a threat as firebombs were thrown at them to set them alight.
In another development, the Haryana Government said the general public of Barwala town and nearby villages tried to move towards the Ashram to express its resentment against Rampal and his activities. But the heavy deployment of force prevented a face-off. It said the Union Home Ministry has also provided two additional companies of CRPF to tackle the situation.

Android Lollipop review for dummies: Yes Google  you have changed the way I use the smartphonePrint
This is what Android Lollipop update means to a layman.
Written by Rajkrishnan Menon | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:42 pm | Updated: November 21, 2014 11:12 am
‘Android 5 System Update': I wasn’t among the many who were eagerly waiting for this message to pop up, and when it did, I lazily said, ‘Later’. But it did not take no for an answer, it persisted. And I downloaded. The whole process took only a little over five minutes.
When my Nexus 5 rebooted, for a moment I thought it had morphed into a Nexus 6: The icons were different, the lock screen was different, the gallery app was gone. Even the fonts had changed. ‘Material design’, I am told.
But I think I’ve made a terrible mistake: Now I have to get used to my phone all over again. For instance, I have to tap twice to open an app or an email. As a first-time Android/Touch phone user, I had barely got used to the one-touch trick. And I haven’t yet figured out how to get rid of the ‘BBM: Connected’ icon from the lock screen.
That’s right. Although I rarely use it, I still have BBM on my phone as a relic from, and a reminder of, a turbulent, not so distant past when my so-called smart phone, a BB, depended on me to stay sorted and alive when it should have been the other way round.
Anyway, I am even finding it slightly difficult to scroll the apps: I am convinced there is a lag. But I also noticed that the lockscreen tells me things like “12 minutes until full” when the phone is charging. Hmm.
Android ‘L’. Looks lighter, trimmer. I also found out about the Flashlight problems (But I guess that has more to do with Nexus) and how it is tough to ‘silence’ your phone totally with this OS. But maybe I’ll learn to like it.
Ok, so I wanted to Google something, and opened Chrome. All I wanted was one tab: For a simple, routine Google search. Whoa! Many of my recent tabs were floating around: Office mail, the Express epaper tab, my Twitter page…I started getting rid of them, stopping after six or seven tabs to think, “Oh God! This is never-ending.
Am I deleting my bookmarks, too?!” No. As it happened, I was only swiping away my recent tabs. It was like I had opened Chrome on my laptop.
I realise these guys meant business when they said, “We’d like to change the way you use smartphones and the web.”
Mission Lollipop has begun.

A technically sound full review of the Android Lollipop will follow soon.

10 nabbed for leakage of Karnataka police recruitment exam papersPrint
By: Express News Service | Bangalore | Posted: November 19, 2014 9:16 pm
Three persons have been arrested by the Gulbarga police for allegedly leaking the question paper for a competitive exam held to recruit civil police constables. The additional Director General of Police (recruitment) NS Megharikh said that the accused identified as Mallanna, Kashinath and Shivakumar, circulated a list of the answers for 77 questions out of 100 given to candidates who took the exam on Sunday.
The police got a tip off on Sunday a few hours prior to the commencement of the examination that some persons were supplying the list of questions and their answers to a few candidates. The police raided an examination centre in Gulbarga and arrested Kashinath, Mallanna and Shivakumar.
All three are natives of Gulbarga and allegedly employed in the police department. Based on information provided by the arrested accused a team of police from the Bangalore Rural region managed to nab seven more persons including six candidates for their involvement in leaking the question papers. One of them has been identified as Sahu a man who runs a tutorial program in Gulbarga. ADGP Megharikh clarified that the police are yet to verify how the accused got their hands on the question paper to prepare the answers.
“We are yet to find out how and where they accessed the question paper. We will conduct a re-examination for the posts of police constables if our investigation reveals a large quantum of beneficiary candidates. We will not conduct a re-examination if the numbers are small,” Megharikh said.
The Karnataka state home ministry conducted a written test in 175 centers across the state on Sunday to fill up 6609 constable posts. A total of 83,166 candidates attended the written examination after they cleared physical standards and efficiency tests.

Gulberg massacre: Trial begins afresh after SC lifts banSupreme Court.
By: Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 19, 2014 9:05 pm
The Gulberg massacre trial began afresh on Wednesday, after the Supreme Court lifted the ban last week and directed that the hearing on the arguments be completed in three months. Five accused sought exemption from appearance, even as the special public prosecutor remained absent, annoying the special designated court which directed them to be present right on time from the next date.
Soon after the principal judge PB Desai, Ahmedabad City and Sessions court, presided over the court the defence lawyers submitted five different applications seeking exemption from appearance. The court, however, refused to entertain the applications and ordered them to be present before it on the next hearing.
“The court was annoyed after SIT lawyer failed to appear with the excuse that he was busy in the high court. The judge passed an order stating that the lawyer should be present in the next hearing by sharp 11 o’clock,” said lawyer SM Vohra who represents witnesses and victims in the case.
Desai is the fourth judge who is presiding over the case in which 69 persons including former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri were burnt alive by the rioters on February 28, 2002 at Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad. This is one of the nine cases being probed by Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT).
This is the same incident in which Jafri’s widow Zakia had filed a case against the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and others. The case was investigated by the SIT that gave clean chit to Modi in 2012 while SIT’s report was upheld by a metropolitan magistrate only last year. Zakia has filed a petition in the high court challenging the appeal.
Before coming to the main matter the court will hear the application filed by victims seeking arraignment of police officials including the then Ahmedabad police commissioner PC Pande, joint commissioner of police MK Tandon, deputy commissioner of police PB Gondia and the then assistant commissioner SS Chudasma in the case.
“The court directed everyone to be present before it on 27th November. First the court is likely to decide on the application filed by the victims who have sought arraigning several police officials as accused in the case,” said advocate Robin Mogera who represent several accused in the case. There are 64 accused in the case, out of who, 5 have already spent 12 years in jail who never got regular bails.

Sharad Pawar flip flop to address two streams of views in NCPAt the end of the conclave a section within the party wondered how NCP would guard its secular credentials by supporting BJP government in state.
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Posted: November 19, 2014 8:47 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 9:07 pm
NCP president Sharad Pawar on Wednesday appeared caught between two contrasting views emerging within the party over providing unconditional support to the BJP government in Maharashtra.
The seasoned politician that he is, Pawar adopted a middle path arguing that he had never advocated snap polls. ”   I have not said that we  would like to destabilise the state government. Our decision to support the government on issues that are in the interest of people is a well known factor.”  he said on Wednesday, a day after telling his party men to gear up for snap polls in the state.
Pawar’s flip flop on supporting the Devendra Fadnavis government has come as a major surprise to political leaders across party lines.   Insiders in the NCP told Indian Express that Pawar was trying to address in-house voices and his thoughts accordingly reflected such voices. According to them, there is no  ambiguity on the NCP’s decision not to dislodge the BJP government in Maharashtra.
At the end of the two day NCP conclave in Alibaug, Pawar said, that he never stated that his party wanted mid-term polls and that they wanted to destablise the government. He went on to explain that it was a fact that the NCP is in favour of a stable government in Maharashtra. But  if the BJP Government lands in trouble for whatever reasons and after taking into account developments in state politics, the party should be ready to fight as an opposition party out on the streets.
However, a former NCP minister on condition of anonymity said,that some party leaders were not in favour of supporting the BJP government as NCP had always retained its secular credentials. ”  Even if we argue our support was issue based and for state stability, it would certainly upset the minorities and secular sections amongst the majority. he said. At the party’s brainstorming session, a senior leader raised questions as to whether people in the state would take the NCP seriously as a serious opposition party by aligning with the BJP.
There were also others in the party who wondered how the party would combat the image problems of the NCP in the context of providing support to the BJP.
Pawar engaged party leaders over two days to seek their views on political developments in Maharashtra. The critical issue relates to consolidation of the party after the major defeat in the  assembly elections in the state.
It was apparent that what weighed high on the mind of Pawar was the BJP government in the state and the performance of  prime minister Narendra Modi- both of  which was discussed at the session.
Pawar said that while they were all amused by continued…

2G case: Court allows CBI plea to summon additional witnessesPrint
Examining the witnesses is essential to the just decision of the case as the movement of amount of Rs 200 crore would become more explicit and role of accused Kanimozhi Karunanidhi in the running of Kalaignar TV (P) Limited would also stand further clarified. (Source: PTI source)
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 8:39 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 8:52 pm
A special court on Wednesday allowed CBI plea to summon additional witnesses and for producing documents before it in 2G spectrum allocation scam trial, observing that it appeared to be “essential” for a just decision in the case. Special CBI Judge O P Saini, however, cautioned the agency that “fragmentary” filing of documents do cause anxiety and uncertainty in a trial and the prosecution should keep in mind that the Indian legal system does not cleave to be theory of “hound-the-accused-at-all-cost-by-all-means-fair-or-foul”.
“The prosecution is endeavouring to prove its existing case with the help of material which has come to its notice subsequently,” the judge said. “In this view of the matter, the examination of these witnesses appears to be essential to the just decision of the case as the movement of amount of Rs 200 crore would become more explicit and role of accused Kanimozhi Karunanidhi in the running of Kalaignar TV (P) Limited would also stand further clarified, amounting to proper proof of existing facts,” the court said.
The court, in its 36-page order, also said that allowing the CBI plea would be in the interest of both the accused as well as the prosecution and it would lead to a “just decision” of the case. It observed that it would not cause any prejudice to the accused and would rather help in determination of the truth.
Cautioning the CBI, the court said that in this case, the prosecution has been allowed to file documents 14 times while the accused has also not “lagged behind” as it has competed with the agency and has been allowed to file documents running into about eight full size steel boxes. “But prosecution should remember that Indian legal system does not cleave to be theory of hound-the-accused-at-all-cost-by-all-means-fair-or-foul.
An accused is also entitled to certain rights and to a fair trial. He is not a quarry to be pursued, caught and killed. He is deemed to be innocent until proved guilty and is entitled to a fair trial,” it said. The CBI had sought to summon Enforcement Directorate Deputy Director Rajeshwar Singh, its Assistant Director Satyendra Singh, Under Secretary in Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Navil Kapur and bank official D Mani.
Apart from these four persons, the agency had sought to recall General Manager (Finance) of Kalaignar TV (P) Ltd G Rajendran, who had earlier deposed as a witness in the case, for further examination besides continued…

What is Singapore model of a smart city and how much India can replicate itPrint
Written by Santosh Singh | Singapore | Posted: November 19, 2014 8:36 pm | Updated: November 26, 2014 9:13 am
Why has been there so buzz around Singapore in terms of Narendra Modi government planning 100 smart cities? Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu has just returned from Singapore after discussing development of AP’s new state capital. His Telengana counterpart K Chandrashekhar Rao visited here earlier with idea of developing his port cities.
India talks of “smart cities” and Singapore Minister of State for foreign affairs Masagos Zulkifli said Singapore had started talking of becoming the “first smart nation” of the country with plans like underground expansion of the city and selective use of robotics to further curtail or enhance human efforts.
Right from coffee shops to Singaporeans with Indian roots to business bodies, there has been a definite buzz around India “breaking barriers”, as Zulkifli put it during his meeting with Indian journalists at a cafe on 14 June. With Singapore PM Lee Tsien Loong calling India a key regional player during recent Asean-India meet and Indian Pm Modi expected to attend Singapore’s 50th Independence Day celebrations next year, there is lot of expectancy around business bodies and individual entrepreneurs looking up to India as next big destination.
Talk to policy makers and city planners and this is what they mean by “a smart city” – a mix of urban town planning, multi-layer sewerage pipes with sensors to detect damage, integrated transport plan to charge less from commuters despite his long distance tours with change in mode of transport and increased focus on bicycling to reach metro rail stations rather than taking cars.
The traffic lights are automated and can decide its stopping seconds as per traffic load. A driver gets 24 points in a year and can lose his license after losing these points for traffic violation. A private contractor, who does not clear dirt near its site on public road, also loses his point for next contract.
“Policemen are hardly visible in Singapore. Yet, all follow rules. It is not about fear of law but about behaving yourself on road”, said Rashidy, a driver. Land Transport Authority Transport Gallery that shows how Singapore itself learnt about traffic management from best practices of the world from Boston, Tokyo and New York displays seven types of driving licences to regulate traffic. One such category is hazardous vehicles. The gallery in-charge talks alternative transport thinking to settle with public transport to minimise car use.
Singapore plans 900 km (10 km developed already) of sheltered cycling paths, something that can be replicated in India. These cycling paths cannot be used by bikers. Bike-sharing scheme, introduced in Singapore, can be easily followed in India to travel to offices on same route.
For easy traffic flow monitoring, Singapore has introduced over 600 Junction eyes to monitor its traffic movement and there is also parking guiding scheme in place to ensure vehicles do not clog at parking places when there are not enough spaces. To ensure pedestrian road safety, road engineering measures such as pedestrian crossing lines with enhanced dash markings and your speed monitoring system.

CM Fadnaviss decision to streamline coal supply generates 1 700 MP powerDevendra Fadnavis.
Written by Shubhangi Khapre | Posted: November 19, 2014 8:24 pm
The state government has taken the decision to increase the power supply to 40 lakh farmers across Maharashtra following streamlining of coal supply that helped to generate additional 1700 MW electricity. At present the power consumption in state is recorded at 14,000 MW.
Several parts of Maharashtra which still faces power cuts due to shortage of electricity will now get some relief. As a single decision to ensure timely delivery of coal supply which often lead to break down in functioning of the power plants will help to cut down load shedding by three hours. On an average the load shedding in state extends upto six to seven hours.
The chief minister Devendra Fadnavis ten days ago held a meeting with union minister for coal and energy Piyush Goyal to tackle the  shortage of coal supply that had adversely affected the working of the power plants across state.
The subsequent meetings between centre-state and its follow- up within a short span has ensured streamlining of coal supply thus  generating additional 1,700 MW electricity. It benefits more than 40 lakh farmers in state. Officials in ministry confirmed, “ Apart from the sustained coal supply, there was huge communcation gap between the orders given and coal rakes delivery to the power plants. The gap often marred the functioning of the power plants and affected the electricity supply.”
According to a senior officer in ministry of coal and power, “ We supply seven hours power in the day for a week. And alternative week we supply eight hours power at night.” From today, “ We have increased the power supply in day from seven to eight hours. And power supply at night has been increased from eight hours to ten hours.”
The Fadnavis government has been emphatically stating that tackling power crisis in state remains the most challenging as it affects both urban and rural Maharashtra.
Fadnavis who took the charge of the government on October 31, convened the meeting with union minister and top officials of state and centre to address the coal shortage that has lead to panic.
As the first step forward he has urged the officials to identify the hurdles that come in the way sustained coal supply to existing power
plants. The directives from the state government was they should make optimum use of the available domestic coal supply to the power plats to increase its efficiency. Admitting that most the plants were functioning only 60 to 65 per cent thus affecting both electricity generation and also the administrative cost of running the unit. As a result the end affect was higher power rates in state compared to neighbouring states like Gujarat , Chattisgarh or Madhya Pradesh.

Operation to continue till Rampals arrest: Haryana CM KhattarPrint
CM Manohar Khattar faces the first major test on the law and order issue involving Rampal since he took over as Chief Minister recently.
By: Press Trust of India | Chandigarh | Posted: November 19, 2014 7:54 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 8:30 pm
Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday said the operation to nab ‘godman’ Rampal will “continue till he is arrested” from Satlok Ashram at Barwala in Hissar district.
The Chief Minister chose Twitter to put forward his views on the violence at Barwala which left over 200 persons injured.
Khattar, who is also the Home Minister, faces the first  major test on the law and order issue involving Rampal since he took over as Chief Minister recently.
There are a number of self-proclaimed godmen in Haryana and neighboring Punjab having a considerable say during Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in the two states.
Khattar has not met the media since the showdown commenced at Barwala last week between the Ashram followers and security personnel, including paramilitary forces.

In first tweet Khattar said, “Serious charges of sedition against Rampal & several followers by Haryana Police. Operations to continue till he is arrested from Ashram.”
In the second tweet, the Chief Minister said, “Govt. & Police are committed to ensure strict compliance of High Court orders, priority is to uphold the law without loss of innocent lives.”
Even as the operation was on at Barwala, he met people at his residence here on Wednesday and Tuesday, but did not meet the media who were briefed by the DGP S N Vashisht and Additional Chief Secretary (Home) P K Mahapatra.
Earlier on November 15, Khattar had through a statement appealed to Rampal to present himself in court “in a peaceful manner” and “without any hindrance”, saying, “one must give utmost priority to upholding the dignity of judicial system.”
He had also appealed to his followers to cooperate in following the directions of Punjab and Haryana High Court.
“In a democratic set up, one must give utmost priority to upholding the dignity of judicial system,” he had said last week after which he made no comments on the situation.
Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday issued a fresh non-bailable warrant against Rampal after he failed to appear in the contempt case.

Terry Walsh walks out  leaves door ajarPrint

India’s Champions Trophy preparations have been left in tatters after chief coach Terry Walsh decided to fly back to Australia on Tuesday. The 60-year-old will leave for Perth on Wednesday after his contract talks with sports ministry and Hockey India failed to materialize.
Walsh insisted there was still a ‘glimmer of hope’ of him returning before the Champions Trophy but for that to happen, the fallout between him and Hockey India president Narinder Batra will have to be addressed.
Batra said he spoke to Walsh on Tuesday morning and demanded an explanation of the charges of financial impropriety during his reign as the technical director of USA Field Hockey. The Australian, it is learnt, asked Batra to withdraw his statement. “He (Walsh) spoke to me in the morning. I said this financial thing needs to be resolved. He said he had all the documents, so I told him to hand it over to me. That would be the end of the issue,” Batra said.
Batra has alleged that Walsh was involved in a financial irregularity of $176,000 during his time in the US for using a software which Walsh had developed along with a firm named SportsTec. The Australian has strongly refuted the claim, saying it was a ‘contractual issue’ between him and USA Hockey.
It is learnt that the CEO of SportsTec Philip Jackson wrote an email to Batra on Tuesday evening, categorically stating that the charges leveled against Walsh are baseless. Batra, however, said he was not in possession of any such mail and would be able to check only after he reaches Delhi on Thursday.
Demand for autonomy
Walsh had resigned as the coach of the national team last month, demanding more autonomy and decision making powers. His one-month notice period ends on Wednesday. Walsh held a meeting with sports minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Tuesday to arrive at a solution but they were unable to make any breakthrough.
The sports ministry maintained their faith in him, insisting he was the right man for the job. “The minister applauded Walsh’s recent performance and believed that he is the right man to take Indian hockey forward. The minister patiently listened to Walsh’s proposals and have agreed to all of them in principle and has asked the committee to find more details,” Sports Authority of India’s Executive Director (teams) Sudhir Setia said. “However, Walsh stated that he needs few days off to go back to Australia. He will then have a re-look at all the proposals offered in a positive manner towards renewal of his contract.”

Wayne Rooney double sinks ScotlandRooney led by example as skipper with his composed side proved too strong for the hosts. (Source: Reuters)
By: Reuters | Glasgow | Posted: November 19, 2014 3:27 pm
England captain Wayne Rooney scored twice after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain headed the opener in a 3-1 win over Scotland as the visitors dominated a typically passionate Auld Enemy friendly at Celtic Park on Tuesday.
Rooney took his tally to 46 in his 101st international to move within three goals of Bobby Charlton’s England scoring record of 49 and led by example as skipper with his composed side proved too strong for the hosts.
Roy Hodgson’s men led 2-0 with seven minutes to play but Scotland came back when Andrew Robertson planted a left-foot shot past former Celtic keeper Fraser Forster to make it 2-1.
But two minutes later Rooney finished off a well-worked move involving substitutes Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert by turning the ball into the net from close range before leaping into an acrobatic celebration.
Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring when he glanced the ball home with his head after a superb pass from his Arsenal team mate Jack Wilshere to score after 32 minutes, reward for England taking control after a frenetic opening to the game.
Rooney headed England 2-0 in front in the 47th minute after Scotland failed to clear a free-kick.
The home side pulled a goal back when Robertson beat Forster at his near post before Rooney wrapped up the victory from close range after a superb swift-passing move down the right.
The home side, who have improved since Gordon Strachan became manager early last year, only had one real goal chance before scoring when Russell Martin forced Forster to palm the ball over the bar early in the second half.
RAUCOUS ATMOSPHERE
There was a raucous atmosphere generated by both sets of supporters in the immediate build-up to the kickoff in front of a near-capacity 60,000 crowd.
The tensions between the two not-always friendly neighbours might have been exacerbated away from the pitch by the recent Scottish independence referendum in which Scots voted 55-45 percent to preserve the 307-year-old union with England.
But apart from the obvious booing of the national anthems most of the derision was directed at the two sets of players.
The opening 20 minutes were predictably frenetic without much shape or substance but England gradually began to look the more assured side with Wilshere in the middle and Nathaniel Clyne on the right causing the home side problems.
It was the first match between the two neighbours, who until 1989 met annually, on Scottish soil since 1999 and England have now won seven of their last nine meetings with the Scots.

Kidambi Srikanth continued his giant-killing spree while Saina Nehwal hardly broke a sweat to advance to the pre-quarterfinals of the USD 350,000 Hong Kong Super Series in Kowloon in Hong Kong on Wednesday.
Srikanth, who had stunned five-time world champion Lin Dan in the China Open Super Series Premier final last week to become the first male shuttler to win a Super Series Premier event, shocked seventh seed Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei 18-21 22-20 21-16 in his men’s singles campaign opener.
In the women’s singles, Saina, who also bagged the China Open title, needed just 27 minute to beat unseeded Jamie Subandhi of United States 21-17 21-11 in her campaign opener.
P V Sindhu also started her campaign on a winning note to book a pre-quarterfinal berth.
Seventh seed Sindhu, who had skipped the China Open, notched up a thrilling 21-15 16-21 21-19 win over Thailand’s Busanan Ongbumrungpan in a women’s singles match that lasted 52 minutes.
Ajay Jayaram, who had won Dutch Open Grand Prix last month, proved no match for top seed Chen Long of China as he went down 13-21 7-21 in another men’s singles match.

It was curtains for the men’s and women’s doubles pairs also as they suffered contrasting defeats to bow out of the competition.

Young performers in ISL should be considered for national team  says SunilChhetriBy: Press Trust of India | Posted: November 19, 2014 9:17 pm
Impressed with the performance of some of the youngsters playing in the ongoing Indian Super League, India captain Sunil Chhetri today said that they deserved to be considered for national team selection.
The likes of C S Sabeeth, Balwant Singh, Durga Boro, Cavin Lobo and Sandesh Jhingan have done well in the ISL for different franchise teams and Chhetri said that the new national team coach could have a look at these players.
“Some of the young players have done so well in the ISL and I am impressed with their performance. I think whoever comes as India coach will have a look at these players (for selection),” Chhetri said.
Some of these players have made it to the India squad but have not played regularly for the country.
“The ISL has given them a platform to show their capability. I hope they continue with their performance,” he said at the sidelines of an event to announce a 4 vs 4 football league for children from 6-14 years of age.
Chhetri also felt that the inaugural ISL has got superb reception from Indian football fans and hoped that it could “sustain” the popularity.
“The ISL has been received very well by the football fans. The tournament has been shown in many channels, including in High Definition and you can access to it in other formats. It has been marketed well. I hope the tournament sustains its popularity in future editions also and keep on growing,” said the 30-year-old striker.
Asked about his own chances of playing in the future editions of ISL, Chhetri, who has one more year in his two-year contract with I-League champions Bengaluru FC, he said, “I have not thought about it”.
“We (Bengaluru FC) are going to play more than 30 matches in the next six months, including the I-League, Federation Cup and AFC Cup. We are very serious about doing well at the Asian club level,” he added.
Chhetri said that India had a mixed result during Wim Koevermans’ a little over two-year stint as head coach but said that the blame should not be laid on the Dutchman.
Koevermans’s contract ended last month and the All Indian Football Federation has been in search of his successor.
“Our performance was a mixed result under Koevermans. We began with a bang with a Nehru Cup win but finishing runners-up at the SAFF Championships last year (after losing to Afghanistan in final) was a debacle.,” he said.
“But we should not blame it on Koevermans. We had a well-settled team before Koevermans came, which included some top names in Indian football. So, after they left, we had some new faces and we had to adjust,” he added.
Asked how much Indian football standard has improved in the few years he has been the captain of the national side, he said, “It’s not that it has not improved but, of course, it has not improved at the pace it should have.
He said he wondered how India of more than one billion population would be below Iraq or Lebanon in FIFA world rankings.
“We have 1.3 billion population and see at these countries like Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. These small countries are ahead of India in FIFA rankings. How can you explain this. We are in the 20s in the rankings among Asian countries. It is sad,” continued…

10 nabbed for leakage of Karnataka police recruitment exampapersPrint
By: Express News Service | Bangalore | Posted: November 19, 2014 9:16 pm
Three persons have been arrested by the Gulbarga police for allegedly leaking the question paper for a competitive exam held to recruit civil police constables. The additional Director General of Police (recruitment) NS Megharikh said that the accused identified as Mallanna, Kashinath and Shivakumar, circulated a list of the answers for 77 questions out of 100 given to candidates who took the exam on Sunday.
The police got a tip off on Sunday a few hours prior to the commencement of the examination that some persons were supplying the list of questions and their answers to a few candidates. The police raided an examination centre in Gulbarga and arrested Kashinath, Mallanna and Shivakumar.
All three are natives of Gulbarga and allegedly employed in the police department. Based on information provided by the arrested accused a team of police from the Bangalore Rural region managed to nab seven more persons including six candidates for their involvement in leaking the question papers. One of them has been identified as Sahu a man who runs a tutorial program in Gulbarga. ADGP Megharikh clarified that the police are yet to verify how the accused got their hands on the question paper to prepare the answers.
“We are yet to find out how and where they accessed the question paper. We will conduct a re-examination for the posts of police constables if our investigation reveals a large quantum of beneficiary candidates. We will not conduct a re-examination if the numbers are small,” Megharikh said.
The Karnataka state home ministry conducted a written test in 175 centers across the state on Sunday to fill up 6609 constable posts. A total of 83,166 candidates attended the written examination after they cleared physical standards and efficiency tests.

Gulberg massacre: Trial begins afresh after SC liftsbanSupreme Court.
By: Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 19, 2014 9:05 pm
The Gulberg massacre trial began afresh on Wednesday, after the Supreme Court lifted the ban last week and directed that the hearing on the arguments be completed in three months. Five accused sought exemption from appearance, even as the special public prosecutor remained absent, annoying the special designated court which directed them to be present right on time from the next date.
Soon after the principal judge PB Desai, Ahmedabad City and Sessions court, presided over the court the defence lawyers submitted five different applications seeking exemption from appearance. The court, however, refused to entertain the applications and ordered them to be present before it on the next hearing.
“The court was annoyed after SIT lawyer failed to appear with the excuse that he was busy in the high court. The judge passed an order stating that the lawyer should be present in the next hearing by sharp 11 o’clock,” said lawyer SM Vohra who represents witnesses and victims in the case.
Desai is the fourth judge who is presiding over the case in which 69 persons including former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri were burnt alive by the rioters on February 28, 2002 at Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad. This is one of the nine cases being probed by Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT).
This is the same incident in which Jafri’s widow Zakia had filed a case against the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and others. The case was investigated by the SIT that gave clean chit to Modi in 2012 while SIT’s report was upheld by a metropolitan magistrate only last year. Zakia has filed a petition in the high court challenging the appeal.
Before coming to the main matter the court will hear the application filed by victims seeking arraignment of police officials including the then Ahmedabad police commissioner PC Pande, joint commissioner of police MK Tandon, deputy commissioner of police PB Gondia and the then assistant commissioner SS Chudasma in the case.
“The court directed everyone to be present before it on 27th November. First the court is likely to decide on the application filed by the victims who have sought arraigning several police officials as accused in the case,” said advocate Robin Mogera who represent several accused in the case. There are 64 accused in the case, out of who, 5 have already spent 12 years in jail who never got regular bails.

Late strikes give New Zealand upper hand on Day2Print
By: Reuters | Dubai | Posted: November 19, 2014 8:55 pm
Younus Khan and Azhar Ali featured in a century-plus stand to prop up Pakistan but New Zealand claimed three wickets in the final session to stay ahead in the second Test in Dubai on Wednesday.
Resuming on 34 for two, Pakistan enjoyed a smooth morning session but lost Younus (72) after lunch and Azhar (75) and two other batsmen after tea to finish day two on 281 for six.
Sarfraz Ahmed (28) and Yasir Shah (one) were in the middle at stumps with Pakistan, who lead the three-match series 1-0, still trailing New Zealand by 122 runs with four wickets in hand.
After cheaply removing Pakistan’s openers late on Tuesday, New Zealand needed early wickets to take the upper hand but were thwarted by Younus and Azhar, who negotiated pace bowlers with aplomb and used their feet effectively against spinners.
Younus, who turns 37 later this month, was the more aggressive of the two, hitting off-spinner Mark Craig for two sixes — one over long on and the other over midwicket.
The right-hander hit the spinner for his sixth boundary to bring up his 29th Test fifty in the final over before the break.
After dominating his 113-run third wicket stand with Azhar, Younus was dismissed by Jimmy Neesham, having extended the red hot form that had produced three centuries and a double hundred in his last six Test innings.
Azhar took three runs off a Craig delivery to register his 18th Test fifty in 150 balls and provided a glimpse of his aggression when he stepped out to hit Craig over long off for a six.
Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq (28) also looked solid at the other end until he edged a Trent Boult delivery to slip.
Leg-spinner Ish Sodhi ended Azhar’s 322-minute vigil with a delivery that brushed the batsman’s pad before hitting the stumps.
Boult bowled Asad Shafiq with an incoming delivery after the batsman offered no shot but, much to Pakistan’s relief, TV replays showed the bowler had overstepped.
Shafiq, then on 21, could not make the most of it though and edged a Tim Southee delivery to Ross Taylor in the slip to depart on 44 in the penultimate over of the day.

IBM on Wednesday launched its new e-mail application for businesses that integrates social media and analytics to help organisations and employees increase productivity.
The new email ‘IBM Verse’, which is a part of company’s strategy to shift from hardware services to cloud computing and data analytics, is the first application to come out from company’s USD 100 million investment in design innovation.
It is the first messaging system to feature 'faceted search', IBM Social Business and
IBM Smarter Workforce Director Anmol Nautiyal said, adding this will enable users to pinpoint and retrieve specific information they are seeking across all the various types of content within their email.
Nautiyal said Verse uses built-in analytics to provide an ‘at-a-glance’ view that intelligently surfaces an individual’s most critical actions for the day. Over time, it can provide instant context about a given project as well as the people and teams collaborating on it.
“Although email is considered one of the most significant advances in workforce productivity over the past 30 years, today it has become one of the greatest organizational burdens. IBM Verse gives enterprise customers, small businesses and individuals a scalable, cloud-based social collaboration environment optimised for mobile and Web environments,” he said.
The company is currently launching the beta version, while a freemium version – a model where basic version is free while more elaborate features need to be purchased -- will be available from the first quarter of next year.
IBM presently has 30,000 active support customers globally for its enterprise mail service named Notes.
IT industry analysts estimate that 108 billion work emails are sent daily, requiring employees to check their inboxes an average of 36 times an hour. It is also estimated that only 14 percent of those emails are of critical importance.
“According to IDC, email remains the single most widely used collaboration tool, with worldwide revenue for enterprise email expected to reach USD 4.7 billion in 2017,” Nautiyal said.

TRAI starts process for review of interconnect chargesNew Delhi, November 19, 2014

TRAI starts process for review of interconnect charges

telecommunication service
Sectoral regulator TRAI has initiated the process to review interconnect charges, which one telecom operator pays to other service providers for using their network to complete calls.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had specified the ‘Interconnect Usage Charges’ (IUC) in 2003 and subsequently the charges have been revised in 2006 and 2009.
The prevailing IUC regime was notified in 2009.
At present, the mobile call termination charges for all local and national long-distance stood at 20 paisa per minute, which means a telecom company pays 20 paise per minute to other company on whose network call has been made.
The termination charge for incoming international long distance calls is 40 paisa per minute.
TRAI on Wednesday released a consultation paper on IUC seeking comments of stakeholders on a host of issues including the approach which needs to be adopted for prescribing the charge, methodology for estimating mobile termination cost and appropriate level for international termination charge.
The regulator in its last review had reduced the interconnect charges.
Stakeholders are required to send their comments to the Authority by December 11 and counter-comments by December 18.
TRAI said in a multi-operator multi-service scenario, an IUC regime is an essential requirement to enable subscribers of one service provider to communicate with subscribers of another service provider.
“Providing interconnection entails costs for which service providers need to be fairly compensated,” it said.
The regulator said primary purpose of an IUC regime is to facilitate inter-operator settlement.

The CBI had filed an application before the court seeking permission to delete Ashok Chavan's name from the Adarsh charge sheet.

Bombay High Court rejects CBI application seeking permission to drop Ashok Chavan's name from the Adarsh charge sheet.
In a blow to Congress leader and former Chief Minister of Maharashtra Ashok Chavan, the Bombay High Court on Wednesday refused to grant him relief in the Adarsh scam. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had filed an application seeking permission to delete Mr Chavan's name as an accused from the Adarsh charge sheet. The court on Wednesday dismissed the application.
It, however, granted stay to the order for four weeks to enable the CBI to appeal in the Supreme Court. In these weeks, the trial court will not be able to initiate any proceedings against Mr Chavan. The trial court has so far not taken cognisance of the charge sheet filed against 13 persons including Mr Chavan and some senior bureaucrats and ex-servicemen.
"The charges levelled against respondent No.2 (Mr Chavan) for the alleged individual acts cannot go ­away only because the Governor has refused to grant sanction for prosecuting respondent No.2 for conspiracy and cheating," Justice M L Tahiliyani said in his order passed on Wednesday morning via video conferencing from the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court.
Mr Chavan has been accused of criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct for granting additional Floor Space Index (FSI) to Adarsh housing society in lieu of flats for relatives, and for illegally allowing 40 per cent allotment to civilians in the housing society initially mooted for the ex-service personnel.
"It cannot be co­incident that two of the close relatives of respondent No.2 got two flats worth crores of rupees according to the market value, by investing much lesser amount as compared to market value," the order stated. Senior counsel for Mr Chavan, Amit Desai, had argued that other societies in the vicinity were granted similar benefits, and that Mr Chavan was being singled out by the CBI for no reason.
But the court said it was not given any evidence to show that other societies too received similar benefits. "Even if it is accepted for the time being, for the sake of arguments, that similar benefit was given to other societies also, it cannot be said that it was in the interest of public," Justice Tahiliyani observed.
In the revision application filed before the Bombay High Court in April this year, the CBI had challenged the lower court's order disallowing it to delete Mr Chavan's name as an accused from the Adarsh proceedings. But the high court on Wednesday upheld the trial court's order.
"It is, thus, clear that the learned trial Judge has given a finding that despite the application by CBI for closing the case or deleting name of respondent No.2, it was not possible to do so because the offence punishable under Section 13(2) is independent of the offences for which the sanction has been refused by the Governor. For all these reasons, the application has been rightly rejected. There is no substance in the revision application. Revision application, therefore, stands dismissed," the order said.

Campbell, 35, was with the Blackhawks from 2008 to 2011, when he was traded to his current team, the Florida Panthers. The Ontario native is most remembered for an assist on the goal that won the 2010 Stanley Cup for the Blackhawks.

Campbell paid $3.05 million in 2009 for the Lincoln Park mansion from its builder. Even after leaving the Blackhawks, he kept the mansion for several years. He first listed it in May for $2.895 million and later cut his asking price to $2.795 million and then to $2.749 million before going under contract in September.
Features include 4-1/2 baths, a great room with built-ins and a fireplace, a wine cellar, a master suite with an infinity tub, a wet bar on the third floor that opens to two outdoor spaces, and a built-in outdoor kitchen with a pizza oven and a fireplace.

Rail-car manufacturing workers claim unsafe conditions1
In March, OSHA investigators found inadequate ventilation to remove flammable vapors, mists or powders in areas where workers spray-paint parts. The company was fined $4,000; the amount later reduced to $2,000. OSHA is a part of the U.S. Department of Labor.
Scott Allen, a spokesman with the Labor Department, said OSHA frequently considers reducing penalties to ensure safety issues are quickly abated to protect workers. Fines range up to $70,000 per violation, depending on the company's size and its safety record, he said.
The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers also has filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging the company has interrogated, threatened and fired workers to discourage them from union membership.
Jobs to Move America and the Chicago Federation of Labor said they plan to air complaints about the company at a demonstration Monday afternoon in downtown Chicago.
To lure Nippon Sharyo's manufacturing facility to Illinois, various governmental units, including the city of Rochelle, ponied up more than $11 million in incentives. The state in 2010 offered more than $4.7 million in a package that included training funds, grants and corporate income tax credits over 10 years. The Illinois Department of Transportation kicked in another $5.5 million to build a rail spur from the BNSF Railway mainline to the new factory, and Rochelle offered more than $800,000 in incentives, including property tax abatements, sales tax exemptions and grants.
In return, Nippon Sharyo pledged to create at least 250 jobs in Illinois and to retain 15 workers from its office in Arlington Heights.

Chicago CEOs show the value of listening to customers  watching data0
“We didn’t listen to what problems our customers had,” Meers said. “They told us they had 40-percent capacity and they really wanted butts in seats. We said, ‘Awesome! Here’s a scheduling system.’ What we wanted to hear was that their problem was online booking, because that’s a solution that we wanted to solve.”
Her company turned a corner, she said, when it began to listen to its customers and began alerting providers  — barbers and hair stylists, nail technicians and spray tan operators —  via text message, phone call and pop-up messaging, whenever a client was seeking a service at a particular time so that the provider could respond and book an appointment.
Maria Christopoulos Katris, CEO at Built In, a network of all-inclusive online hubs for local tech communities, emphasized the importance for companies just getting started to hire smart people and entrepreneurs.
“The worst thing you can do is to have somebody who is too rigid,” she said.
Katris also said she has a low tolerance for employees who are reluctant to challenge her.
“I’m not afraid to have people smarter than me,” she said. “It’s the most important thing you can do. I rely on them to give all the input I need to reach decisions.”
WeDeliver founder Jimmy Odom said he appreciates any time his mentors can give him.
“I expect wisdom from them,” he said. “I expect them to be smarter than me. I expect my advisers to give me real feedback. Don’t placate me.”
Odom emphasized the importance of data to improve operations. He suggested finding five metrics that indicate the success or failure of the business.
“When you look at your company, you’ve got to benchmark yourself,” Odom said. “Numbers don’t lie.”
He added: “Don’t care about what your competitors are doing. Focus on your customers.”

Tips for cold  cold car care3
While you’re there, check the status of your S belt, or serpentine belt. It’s the big one that is immediately visible at the front of the engine. The visible, or back side, has grooves like a tire. If they’re cracked or worn, then it might be time to consider changing it so it doesn’t snap in cold cold cold weather.   
Fill your fluids:
Spend a buck and get a “winter blend” type of windshield wiper fluid. Winter blends have a greater concentration of alcohol and less water, so less likely to freeze.
Fill your antifreeze. If it hasn’t been flushed in a few years, then it could use it. Green-colored antifreeze is the most common; whichever color you choose, don’t mix colors. Coolant and antifreeze are interchangeable terms. Coolant is typically sold premixed, that is it is half water, half antifreeze, as it needs to be. Antifreeze can be pure and needs to be mixed. Check the bottle; it’ll tell you.
Check your oil. If it’s due for a change, consider refilling it with a lower viscosity oil. On the bottle it lists two numbers, or grades, the first for low temperature viscosity, the second for high temperature. 10W-30 is a common designation. The higher the number, the more viscous, or thick it is, the less fluid it is especially in cold temps. So you might want to consider 5W-20 or-30. That ‘W’ stands for winter, according to Valvoline and other sources.
Wipers:
Visibility is key in all forms of driving, but winter conditions can limit visibility, and not just because of your faux-fur hood. If your blades have done just a mediocore job with the snow, it’s only going to get worse with the freeze. Winter wipers do a better job of swatting away moisture and can be had for under $20 for the pair.   
Tire pressure:
Having the correct tire pressure is essential for proper handling. A temperature change of just 10 degrees can cause a ten percent reduction, or constriction, of air in tires. So tire pressure can be affected from day to night temperature. Check the optimal tire pressure of your vehicle on the label inside the driver’s door frame or in the owner’s manual. DO NOT USE THE PSI on the TIRE! That’s max capacity for the tire, not for your car’s specific load.
Additional preventative measures:
Some mechanics recommend adding a can of Heet or other fuel-line antifreeze to the gas tank to eliminate water from the fuel lines. If your fuel lines are already frozen, this won’t help.
Buy an emergency kit with cables, first aid kit, flares, battery powered air compressor and other things that can prevent a minor inconvenience from becoming a major problem.
Check the clarity of all your lights. If your headlights are all fogged up, consider cleaning them with toothpaste. We haven’t tried this yet, but hear the results are magical.
Weather conditions are variable, and all cars handle them a bit differently, so as a car owner you have a responsibility to know your car. While this may not be legally advisable or practical in the current driving climate, consider finding a parking lot with no obstruction and practicing turns and braking in the conditions. Find out how the car reacts to your driving and adjust your driving accordingly. It shouldn’t be fun. Avoid doing cookies, but practice fishtailing to teach yourself how not to overcompensate by wrenching the wheel too far one way or the other. What level of acceleration might cause a spin out, how does the car turn in snow—all these things can be researched at minimal speeds.
Practice skids. If you’re in a skid, take it easy, don’t slam the brake; turn the wheel in the direction you want the vehicle to face, which you may have to do several times in a skid to straighten out. The most important thing is don’t freak out.
Operational:

Battery care: The most common winter car malady is the battery not starting. How to prevent it if you’ve taken the preventative steps outlined above?
The number one thing you should do for the night is shut off all accessories—the heat, radio, interior lights—any power source that could be a drain for the battery.
If you don’t have access to a garage, try parking with the hood as near a building as possible to be shielded from the wind. Also, buildings are warmer than out in the open, and you’ll be warmer too.
You could go crazy and detach the battery and bring it inside with you every night, like a cat or something, but that’s pretty inconvenient, especially since you’ll have to reattach it in the equally cold morning.
You could make a battery snuggie overnight and cover the battery in a blanket, or even the entire hood, or buy a protective plastic sheet or tarp from an auto parts store. Just make sure you remember to take it off in the morning. You want the car warm, not on fire.
If the car doesn’t start after 15-20 seconds of trying, let the car sit for 2 minutes before trying again.

Google s Brian Fitzpatrick says he s got just the ticket for Alinea0
Before adopting the ticketing system at Alinea, consistently rated among the top restaurants in the world, Kokonas employed three full-time workers to handle reservation lines, he wrote in a June blog post. The post, long enough to be deemed a manifesto for restaurant ticketing, has generated more than 1 million page views, Kokonas said.
"A high volume of calls, especially around the days we would open a month's reservations book, meant that callers often could not get through," he wrote. "One time so many people called that the entire 312-867 exchange went down. AT&T asked us if we were running a Groupon."
Fitzpatrick met Kokonas Jan. 14, 2009. He knows the date.
"I keep almost everything," he demurred, half-joking, in a joint phone interview with Kokonas, as he looked up the date. "Grant had come over to Google to give a talk."
Thereafter, Kokonas and Fitzpatrick kept bumping into each other at dinners or events. Fitzpatrick invited Kokonas to ORD Camp. And at some point, Kokonas began soliciting Fitzpatrick's advice, forwarding that blog post, for instance, and asking for feedback.
Fitzpatrick replied that he had already read the post. Twice.
"He asked me to vet some engineers, to help him find some people who are not going to screw him over," Fitzpatrick said. "So we sat in his kitchen and drank espresso for two hours. And I decided I didn't want to advise people on this. I wanted to do this. I think this is the future of restaurants."
Fitzpatrick joked that when he extended the offer, it was the only moment he'd ever seen Kokonas rendered speechless.
"I didn't expect it," Kokonas said. "But I instantly said, 'OK. We'll figure it out.' He's joining not as an employee but as a founding partner in this effort."
When Fitzpatrick launched Google's Chicago engineering team in 2005, the company employed him and 29 sales people here, he said.
"One engineer showed up in jeans, and everybody else was dressed up fancy," Fitzpatrick recalled. "And I thought, it's never going to be the same, folks."
Chicago is now home to more than 550 employees, including about 100 engineers, according to a Google spokeswoman.
Fitzpatrick, who goes by "Fitz," has not helmed the engineering team here for many years. He moved on to found and lead Google's "data liberation front," ensuring Google users can take their files and photos elsewhere, or delete them.
He also leads the company's transparency engineering team, which tallies and helps publish the number and types of government requests Google receives to remove content or turn over information about users for criminal investigations.

Bloomberg News is reporting: 
McDonald's largest restaurant in Russia is reopening after being shuttered for three months. The restaurant in Moscow's Pushkin Square is set to open today, according to a spokeswoman for Oakbrook-based McDonald's.
The store had been ordered closed as Russian consumer-safety inspectors clashed with McDonald's.
The troubles had been linked to mounting tensions over the conflict in Ukraine.

Mothers comforting babies in pain actually changes the gene activity in infants brainsBy Elahe Izadi November 18 Follow @ElaheIzadi
Putting very little babies through numerous medical procedures is especially challenging for physicians, in part because reducing the pain they experience is so difficult.
Typically for patients, "the preferred method of reducing pain is opiates. Obviously you don't want to give opiates to babies," says neurologist Regina Sullivan of NYU Langone Medical Center. "Also, it's difficult to know when a baby is in pain and not in pain."
In recent years, research has shown environmental factors, like a mother or caregiver having contact with a baby during a painful procedure, appears to reduce the amount of pain felt by the baby, at least as indicated by the child's behavior, Sullivan said. But she and Gordon Barr of the University of Pennsylvania, an expert in pain, were interested in whether a mother's presence actually changed the brain functioning of a baby in pain.
So Sullivan and Barr turned to rats. Specifically mama and baby rats who were in pain. And they found that hundreds of genes in baby rats' brains were more or less active, depending on whether the mothers were present. Sullivan and Barr presented their committee peer-reviewed research before the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting Tuesday.
They gave mild electric shocks to infant rats, some of which had their mothers around and others who didn't. The researchers analyzed a specific portion of the infants' brains, the amygdala region of neurons, which is where emotions like fear are processed. "We found that the pattern of gene expression was very different in the two conditions," Barr said. "Many of the genes that were changing because the mother was present are later related to brain development. ... We know that having the mother is not innocuous, it is a major shaper."
But it's not clear yet what the long-term impacts of such pain therapy are on these babies. Sullivan has previously done research, using animals, on what happens to babies when a caregiver is around while pain is inflicted. "We have evidence from other experiments, having repeated pain with an attachment figure [present], produces a brain susceptible to psychiatric disorders," Sullivan said. "I don't think the infants can tell the difference" as to who and what is the source of the pain.
"These procedures being done on an infant may be very beneficial in that moment in time," Barr said. "We do want to reduce the pain but we need to think about what are the long term consequences."
That will be the next question for researchers: what happens to these brains and babies in the future, long after they experience pain.

Sears parent's fundraising pays off with oversubscribed rights offering.
Sears Holdings Corp. expects to receive the full $625 million it had targeted in a previously announced rights offering after the subscription period ended Tuesday evening with the offering oversubscribed, the retailer said.
  Open link
Hoffman Estates-based Sears has initiated several fundraising efforts in the past few months to boost liquidity through the holidays and beyond as the struggling department store chain reassures vendors it can pay for its orders. The $625 million in five-year, 8 percent senior unsecured notes and warrants is on top of $380 million Sears raised by selling most of its stake in Sears Canada through a rights offering. That offering closed last week also oversubscribed.
Sears Chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert, who through his hedge funds owns 48.5 percent of the company, has fully exercised his subscription rights for both offerings, so almost half of the $1 billion raised came from his pockets. In addition, Lampert lent Sears $400 million in September.

Zomato gets $60 mn more in funding  now valued at $660 mnDelhi cab rape case: What Uber, others say and what they deliver
In what is turning out to be one of the biggest Internet success stories in India, restaurant search and discovery service Zomato has got a fresh round of funding of $60 million. With this the total funding has gone up to $113 million and the post-money valuation $660 million.
This round of funding is being led jointly by Info Edge (India) Limited and Vy Capital, with participation from Sequoia Capital. These funds will be used to accelerate Zomato’s global expansion and new product development, Zomato said in a release. Zomato had earlier raised $53 million from Info Edge (India) Limited and Sequoia Capital over multiple rounds of funding.
“Zomato is well on its way to becoming the world’s local expert in dining out. In the past year, we have added eight countries and millions of new users to our foodie truck. From just restaurant discovery and menus, Zomato has now become a vast global community driven by social interactions. This is an exciting point in our journey, as we accelerate our way across the globe, and build a product that will continue to redefine the way people dine,” said Deepinder Goyal, Founder and CEO of Zomato.
Founded in 2008 with its headquarters in New Delhi, Zomato now caters to 300,000 restaurants across the 18 countries. The service is popular among people who want to see what the menu of a restaurant looks like before making a booking and also has strong review content.
Zomato sees over 30 million visits across its web and mobile platforms every month. More than half of the traffic is seen on its mobile apps.
Zomato has acquired four companies — MenuMania in New Zealand, Lunchtime in the Czech Republic, Obedovat in Slovakia, and Gastronauci in Poland — and  plans to expand to 14 more countries across Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Americas.
Since their first investment in Zomato almost four years ago, Sanjeev Bikhchandani, Founder of Info Edge, said the team has shown phenomenal progress to build the Zomato that we know and use. “The company is growing very fast, and we are proud to back them up to further grow the business – both inside and outside of India.”
Alexander Tamas, Founding Partner of Vy Capital, said, “Zomato is one of the first Internet companies out of India with a consumer product that is scaling on a global basis and a team that is executing extremely well against the opportunity. We look forward to being long-term partners of the company as it establishes itself among the global Internet leaders.”

Chart: The worlds most generous countriesBy Adam Taylor November 19 Follow @mradamtaylor
For the fifth year running, the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) has released its annual World Giving Index , a study that investigates and ranks the charitable behavior of different countries around the world.
Sharing the top place in their 2014  list is Burma (Myanmar) and the United States, closely followed by Canada, Ireland and New Zealand.
(Charities Aid Foundation)
The British-based foundation, which works to facilitate and encourage donations to charity, uses its own system to come up with its rankings, using information from Gallup’s World View World Poll about how much people help strangers, how much money they donate and how much time they spend volunteering.
The use of three different factors may help to explain the diverse nature of the list. While the presence of the United States, the country with the highest Gross Domestic Product in the world, at the top of the list may seem somewhat logical, American readers might be surprised to see they share that top spot with Burma, a relatively poor country that only emerged from a decades-long dictatorship in recent years.
However, CAF's report notes that Burma's high position is largely due to specific aspects of Burma's religious makeup and culture:
Whilst America’s strong performance across all forms of giving contributes to its top ranking, Myanmar’s position is driven primarily by an incredibly high proportion of people donating money (91%). This reflects the strong Theravada Buddhist community within Myanmar, with its estimated 500,000 monks (the highest proportion of monks to population of any Buddhist country) receiving support from lay devotees. Indeed, the practice of charitable giving or dana is integral to religious observance amongst Theravada Buddhists, with it being one of the key paths to earning good merit. The position of Myanmar reminds us how important each country’s distinctive culture is in the predilection of its people to be charitable.
The U.S. lags behind here, only ninth in the rankings of amount of people donating money, though it ranked high in the two other categories. It should be noted that the donating money score refers only to the percentage of people who gave money in the last month, and not the sum total of the amount given, which may hinder countries with large individual donors.
The report also notes that global events play a major role. For example, look at Malaysia, another high entry:
Malaysia has experienced a significant improvement across all three ways of giving, resulting in a 26 percentage point increase in its World Giving Index and a move from seventy-first place to seventh. This behavioral change is likely to reflect the humanitarian effort undertaken following Typhoon Haiyan in the neighboring Philippine archipelago, and is in line with giving uplifts recorded following other natural disasters in China and Japan.

CCI clears Coca-Colas deal with Monster Beveragesconsumer goods
Competition Commission has cleared Coca-Cola Company’s proposed deal with US-based Monster Beverage Corp in the energy drinks market.
The deal involves Coca-Cola, its group firm European Refreshments, Monster and its subsidiary New Laser Corp (NewCo). Besides, NewCo’s subsidiary New Laser Merger Corp is part of the proposed combination.
Clearing the proposed combination, that pertains to non-alcoholic beverages, the Commission said the deal is not likely to have an appreciable adverse impact on competition in the country.
Under the deal, Coca-Cola — directly and through European Refreshments — would acquire “one share less than 16.666 per cent of the common stock of NewCo”.
Then, energy drinks and non-energy drinks portfolio would be re-organised between Coca-Cola and Monster. This would be done in such a way that NewCo would acquire energy drinks assets from Coca-Cola and some of its subsidiaries while Coca-Cola would buy some non-energy drinks assets from Monster.
Among others, New Laser Merger Corp would be merged with Monster.
In India, Coca-Cola has insignificant presence in the energy drink segment while Monster has minimal presence with some of its energy drink brands that are imported.
“The parties have insignificant presence in this (energy drinks) segment, in India. It is also observed that post combination, the vertical arrangements between the parties is not likely to result in the foreclosure of competition in view of their insignificant presence in the energy drink segment, in India,” the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said in its order dated November 10.
US-based Monster Beverage Corp is mainly into the energy drink segment.

Empee Distilleries buys its power outfit

electricity production and distribution
As part of its restructuring plan, Empee Distilleries has acquired 89.85 per cent equity shares of its unlisted firm – Empee Power and Infrastructure Private Ltd., on October 30 and the latter has become a subsidiary of the company.
Empee Power and Infrastructure was accorded permission to set up a 2X660 MW super critical coastal thermal power plant in Sirkazhi, Nagapattinam District at an investment of Rs.6,500 crore. “The land and other permissions are in place. But, it is put on hold as the market conditions are not conducive,” said a top company official.
Talking to The Hindu, the group official said that following dismal performance of its subsidiaries for the last few years, the group had embarked on a restructuring plan and deferred fresh investments and expansion plan for next 12 months.
Empee Power Company (India), another unlisted firm, incurred loss mainly on account of low power tariff and increase in interest rates to 14.30 per cent on the loans availed by the company.
Empee Power has power plants with a totaling capacity of 80 MW. The company has a 20 MW cogeneration power plant at Naidupet in Andhra Pradesh attached to sugar plant. Besides, there are three units in Tamil Nadu – 50 MW Independent Power Plant attached to integrated sugar complex at Ambasamudaram , a 10 MW bio-mass based renewable energy power plant at Aranthangi and a windmill in Tiruppur, which is yet to be commissioned. The power generated through these units are sold to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh state grids.
Last month, Empee Sugars and Chemicals Ltd gave its nod for 100 per cent divest of its shareholding in the subsidiary (Empee Power), but it was also deferred.

"The first lot 74 blocks will be auctioned, but the number of mines a company can bid will be capped to avoid monopoly."
The government on Wednesday issued draft guidelines for e-auction of coal blocks cancelled by the Supreme Court. The auctions, Coal Secretary Anil Swarup said will begin on February 11.
“The bid due date would be around February 11. We hope to finalise the technical bid qualification by March 3. The auction will get moving on March 6 and we hope that by March 16, we should be able to issue a vesting order,” Mr Swarup said.
No power tariff hike
Announcing a timeframe for the e-auction of coal blocks cancelled by the Supreme Court in September, Coal Secretary Anil Swarup on Wednesday said the government is putting in place a system to ensure power tariffs do not rise.
Mr Swarup said, “Coal block auction is not a revenue maximisation exercise…It is our endeavour that power tariff does not rise due to auction. We are in the process of evolving a system, which has not been finalised yet… It is essential to keep a lid on tariff,” the Secretary said.
The Supreme Court had cancelled the allotment of 204 mines allotted since 1993, terming them “arbitrary and illegal”.
Cap on allotments
In the first lot, 74 blocks will be auctioned, but the number of mines a company can bid will be capped to avoid monopoly, the Secretary added. Additionally, the mines will be allocated only for specified end-use like power generation.
The e-auction of coal blocks will have a two-stage tender process of technical and financial bids, as per the draft rules, which seek stakeholders’ comments by November 24.
The Central Government will issue an order to the Nominated Authority specifying which coal mines are to be auctioned and which are to be allotted to Government firms.
The Nominated Authority, will prepare a ‘Mine Dossier’ containing particulars of geographical area, coal reserves, mine infrastructure, approvals, permits, etc. for each mine. The Centre has already appointed Joint Secretary, Coal, Vivek Bhardwaj as the Nominated Authority.
Further, the rules state, “Eligibility to bid for Schedule II & III coal mines shall be dependent on the status of preparedness of their end use plant -- 80 per cent of investment made in the EUP for Schedule II mines and 60 per cent of investment made in the EUP for Schedule III mines.”

A closer look at Morgan Moses and Tom Comptons playComments
By Mark Bullock November 19
The Washington Redskins entered the season with Trent Williams and Tyler Polumbus as their starting tackles. But by the time the Redskins offense took the field for their second drive against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this past Sunday, They had third-round rookie Morgan Moses playing left tackle, and 2012 sixth-round pick Tom Compton playing on the right side.
Both Moses and Compton were expected to challenge for the starting right tackle job over the offseason, but neither did enough to win the job outright. After Polumbus put together a string of poor performances, he was benched in favor of Compton, leaving Moses as the backup swing tackle. Williams went down with injuries to both his knee and ankle, putting him in doubt for Sunday’s game against San Francisco. That opened the door for Moses at left tackle.
Moses played well in Williams’s absence, drawing praise from Jay Gruden after the game. One of the Redskins’ biggest tests this week was how they were able to handle the stunts by the Buccaneers’ defensive line. I wrote last week about how Tampa Bay frequently used the ‘TEX’ or tackle-end exchange stunt. Moses came in and picked it up well.
Here, we see Tampa running their TEX stunt. They also have a defensive end on the other side matched up one-on-one with Compton.
Moses does a nice job helping out left guard Shawn Lauvao as defensive tackle Gerald McCoy attacks his outside shoulder. Moses helps slow down McCoy while still being in position to take on the edge rusher.
Moses soon recognizes the stunt and works back inside to take McCoy and free up Lauvao to take the edge rusher stunting back inside. On the other side of the line, Compton gets himself into a poor position with his feet and surrenders inside leverage to the defensive end.
After surrendering inside leverage, Compton struggles to regain his position, allowing the edge rusher work the outside around Compton. On the left side, Moses picks up the block of McCoy without any troubles and gives Lauvao plenty of time to slide across to pick up the stunting defensive end.
Moses stonewalls McCoy, but Compton can’t contain his defender, who reaches out and attempts to strip the ball from Robert Griffin III . Griffin manages to hold onto the ball, but is sack after right guard Chris Chester is also beaten inside.
This play shows the theme for the game. Moses overall did a pretty good job, while Compton struggled, particularly in pass protection. Moses did have one bad play in the run game, where he left the defensive end unblocked.
The ball is being run behind Moses to the left side. Moses is meant to take on the block of the defensive end.
Moses gets a hand on the defensive end, thinking tight end Logan Paulsen is taking on the block. But Paulsen leaves the block for Moses.
Moses leaves the defensive end to take on a second-level player, when really he should have blocked the end and let fullback Darrel Young take on the second-level defender.
But that was one of the few mistakes for Moses, which I think can be put down to him being a rookie. For the most part, he was solid in both aspects of his game.
This was an outside zone run to the left. Moses is assigned with blocking defensive end Michael Johnson.
Moses gets from help from left guard Lauvao early on, who shoves Johnson outside before working up to the second level.
Moses then fights for position with Johnson, keeping him running to the outside and washing him out of the play.
As Morris cuts back, you can see Moses continues to occupy Johnson and keep him away from the play. Morris breaks a few tackles on his way to a nine-yard gain.
Moses had a solid game and will need to build on that should Williams be unable to play next week. With a week of film for the 49ers to work with, you can bet they’ll find a way to test Moses, so it will be interesting to see how he copes with that.
Compton on the other hand, struggled in both aspects of his game, but particularly in pass protection. We saw him giving up a pressure earlier, and things got worse as the game went on. Part of his problem was dealing with speed rushers off the edge and getting his feet set.
This is another simple speed rush off the edge.
Compton is slow to cut off the rush, leaving his feet in a poor position. The defensive end quickly picks up on this and turns his speed rush into a bull rush. He engages first, landing his hand inside Compton, despite Compton having a longer reach.
Compton again surrenders inside leverage and fails to keep his feet under him and his hips square to the target.
That allows the rusher to simply toss Compton aside and work back inside.
Griffin is sacked while Compton is getting back up. This was a complete failure in technique from Compton, which resulted in a quick sack on Griffin.
Compton also had mental errors against Tampa Bay.
Again the edge defender runs the arc against Compton.
But Compton is more concerned with the blitzing defensive back, instead of the edge rusher. Compton lets the defensive end go free to pick up the blitzing defensive back.
Compton picks up the blitzing defensive back, but the free edge rusher turns the corner and quickly sacks Griffin. Perhaps Compton thought he had help from the running back, who actually lined up on the opposite side and ran into the flat to Griffin’s left. But even if he felt he had help from the back, he should have taken the bigger defensive end and left the smaller defensive back to the running back.
Moses playing well will add pressure on Compton. If Williams returns, Moses will be back to competing for the starting right tackle job that Compton currently occupies. If they both perform like they did against the Buccaneers, then Moses will beat out Compton before long.

Everything Google knows about you (and how it knows it)By Caitlin Dewey November 19 Follow @caitlindewey
A Google data center in Mayes County, Okla. (AP Photo/Google, Connie Zhou)
According to Google, I am a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who speaks English as her primary language and has accumulated an unwieldy 74,486 e-mails in her life. I like cooking, dictionaries and Washington, D.C. I own a Mac computer that I last accessed at 10:04 p.m. last night, at which time I had 46 open Chrome tabs. And of the thousands and thousands of YouTube videos I have watched in my lifetime, a truly embarrassing number of them concern (a) funny pets or (b) Taylor Swift.
I didn’t tell Google any of these things intentionally, of course — I didn’t fill out a profile or enter a form. But even as you search Google, it turns out, Google is also searching you.
This isn’t exactly new news. Google has, since 2009, published a transparency tool called Dashboard , which lets users see exactly what kind of data the Internet giant has on them and from which services. But the issue of data collection has provoked renewed anxiety of late, perhaps spurred by recent investigations into personal data and search engines in Europe and Asia — as well as the high-profile hacking of celebrities’ personal data and the shadow of last year’s National Security Agency revelations.
According to a recent survey by the consumer research firm Survata, people care more about Google accessing their personal electronic data than they do the NSA, their boss, their parents, or their spouse. Which is unfortunate, given that your parents and boss will probably never see everything you search, e-mail and click — while Google logs that material more or less all the time.
“Google knows quite a lot,” said Ondrej Prostrednik, the author of  a recent Medium post  about Google data collection that has begun making the Reddit rounds. “People outside of Google can only guess. But it is important to realize that we are the ones giving it all the data they know.”
(Google)
Prostrednik is, perhaps, an unusual face for the Google surveillance crusade. The 25-year-old Web designer lives in Bratislava, Slovakia, and has a graduate degree in European affairs. But since April, he’s been working on a little-known start-up called Cloud Fender , which syncs user documents across multiple cloud-based storage systems. The job necessarily involves a lot of data and a lot of pondering about where and how that data is stored.
So, late last week — apropos of nothing! — Prostrednik compiled a list of all the places where Google users can see their personal results. His list promptly flew to the top slot of Reddit’s wildly popular tech forum, where it has attracted almost 1,000 comments.
“They know everywhere I’ve been every day for several years,” one user observed. “… I do find it very interesting, but it’s also very scary because I don’t doubt it’s possible to hold this information against me at some point.”
In all probability, that’s true! (Courts are already working with less.)
But it’s not that any of this is a secret, necessarily. In fact, in many instances, you’ve signed off on Google’s tracking, whether by signing up for a Google service or opting in on an Android phone. The startling thing is that we forget all this information is being stored, forever, in one centralized place. The small, ordinary act of sending an e-mail or making a search or looking up directions may seem revelatory, in and of itself. But when you compile all those thousands of disparate e-mails and searches and directions over time, which Google does, you end up with something far more intimate — something not too far removed from a detailed portrait of your life and interests.
Consider, for instance, the Google services you probably use on a daily basis. There’s search and e-mail; maybe you also use Chrome, Google’s Internet browser, to access the Web. But that’s just the beginning.
(Google)
If you have an Android phone, that device may log your location and velocity data. If you have a YouTube account, Google knows not only what videos you upload, but which you watch, too. There’s Google Maps. Google Play. Google Voice, if you use it to transcribe your missed calls. Between Google Contacts and Chat, the site has a pretty good idea who you’re friends with.
And while browsing data is aggregated differently than information from Google services, if you visit sites running Google Ads or Google Analytics software, Google also generally knows what you look at and what you click. According to one report from UC Berkeley’s School of Information, Google can track user behavior on 88 percent of all Internet domains.
Simply put, there are very few corners of modern life that Google doesn’t touch.
Let’s look at a fairly standard case study, for example. Today is Tuesday, and I’m starting to think about what I’m going to get up to this weekend. I’ll probably Gchat a friend and ask if she wants to grab dinner. After that, I’ll Google a couple of restaurant options and check out their menus (in Chrome, naturally) and eventually settle on a spot for dinner. I’ll e-mail my friend to confirm. And when the appointed date arrives, knowing my sense of direction, I’ll probably use Google Maps to figure out how to get there.
Check it: That is an utterly ordinary process that millions of people go through millions of times a week. And during the process, Google gets not one, not two, but five data points on me. (More, perhaps, depending on how long I took clicking around for restaurants.)
None of this is malicious, per se. It’s just the necessary consequence of one company providing such an incredible range of services — of becoming so inextricably embedded in the lives of, as a Google statement put it in 2009, “hundreds of millions of people … around the world.”
“We are very aware of the trust that you have placed in us, and our responsibility to protect your privacy and data,” it said.
In that vein, Google does give users some tools to limit how much data it can collect. You can turn off the tools that track your personal search history and that sync your Chrome use between computers. You can also opt out of interest-based ads — those vaguely creepy messages that invite you to buy a camera after you’ve just gotten an e-mail on the subject.
But if you want to avoid Google’s gaze entirely, some more radical lifestyle changes may be in order — like, maybe consider quitting the Internet and moving into the woods. Just make sure you bring lots of survival guides with you. In case of emergency, there will be no Google search.

In Arizona  Caps get another strong effort from HoltbyBy Alex Prewitt November 19 Follow @alex_prewitt
(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)
GLENDALE, Ariz. – The last time Braden Holtby met reporters, he wore an expressionless mask, somber and searching for an answer after one mistake cost the Washington Capitals a game . Here Tuesday night, cameras surrounded Holtby again, and he still donned a blank stare, the postgame stoicism he had always tried to show, except now it came in the aftermath of a 2-1 overtime win in which he starred.
“It was a good response by Holts,” said Coach Barry Trotz, referring to Saturday night’s one-goal loss to the New Jersey Devils, in which the one goal came solely because Holtby misplayed a puck behind the net and passed it straight to an opponent.
Now, though, Holtby had allowed two or fewer goals for the fourth straight game, a stark contrast from the early season struggles in which he allowed 12 over three, though he feels not much has changed.
“It’s coming,” he said. “To be honest with you, I don’t really feel that different from when things were going bad. I think the work is paying off now. It’s coming together a little more.”
With goaltending coach Mitch Korn watching from above, back after attending the Hall of Fame induction ceremony of his old pupil, Dominik Hasek, Holtby made 23 calming saves, none particularly flashy or noteworthy, just offering the Capitals a capable last line of defense through a breezy first period, third period and overtime, and a steadiness during a second period in which they killed three penalties.
“The Jersey game was really tight-checking, not much room,” Trotz said. “It shouldn’t been a 0-0 game and into overtime, then he made that mistake and we ended up getting no points. Tonight was another one, tight game, good response by him.”
The Capitals could ride Holtby if they want, with four games between now and their next back-to-back. They practice Wednesday afternoon at the University of Denver, face Colorado on Thursday, take Friday off to travel back, host Buffalo on Saturday, then get the New York Islanders twice next week, bracketing Thanksgiving.
And why wouldn’t they? Holtby chalked up his lone goal allowed to the Coyotes, a second-period backdoor rocket from Oliver Ekman-Larsson, as a tip-your-hat kind of score, two minutes into the frame.
“It kind of was the perfect storm,” he said of the goal. “I thought we played it fairly well. I was trying to be aggressive on the guy, he had a pretty good scoring chance to being with, the puck went to him again, and it was pretty good vision by him to find that late guy before we could. Yeah, it wasn’t a goal based on our lack of trying, that’s for sure.”
Otherwise, as Washington controlled possession for the opening and closing periods, and throughout overtime until forward Eric Fehr’s winner, Holtby provided exactly the safety net needed, only facing 14 shots outside the second period and turning away each one. He stayed in the correct post position and snuffed a wraparound. He made a sprawling stop during a penalty kill. And most importantly, he did not commit the same puck-handling blunder that gift-wrapped the Devils a victory.
Over the past four games, dating back to a season-high 38 saves in Chicago, Holtby has allowed six total goals and posted a save percentage of .949.
“There’s still a lot of room for improvement,” he said. “I honestly think these last four games I’ve given up more goals than I’m capable of having than I did previous. It’s just nice to get the win tonight.”
Later, when asked about Holtby’s performance, forward Jay Beagle stammered, and later joked the question had caught him off guard. “Great,” he said, as if there were even a doubt. “I think he’s great every night. He’s a great goalie, so…”

Blockade by Bodo delays trains inAssamPrint

Several trains including the 12423 Dibrugarh-New Delhi Rajdhani Express were delayed following a sudden blockade of railway tracks by the Bodo People’s Coordination Peace Initiative of Bodoland Territorial Autonomous Districts at the Kokrajhar railway station today. The agitationists were demanding immediate release of NDFB founder and chairman Ranjan Daimary alias DR Nabla who is currently lodged in a jail here.
Northeast Frontier Railway sources said while the New Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express was delayed by about 40 minutes, three other major trains – 12345 Howrah-Guwahati Saraighat Express, 15909 Tinsukia-Lalgarh Avadh-Assam Express and 15471 Alipurduar-Kamakhya Inter-City Express – were delayed by more than four hours.
Other important trains that were disrupted included the Gaya-Kamakhya Express, Dibrugarh-Kolkata Express, Poorvottar Sampark Kranti Express, Guwahati-Trivandrum Express and Kamrup Express, NF Railway sources said. The blockade that began suddenly at 5 M today was however withdrawn at 9:45 AM.
This was the second consecutive day that trains were disrupted in Assam. As many as five trains were disrupted and delayed yesterday after the All Assam Tea Tribes Association resorted to a railway blockade for nearly three hours at Sarupathar station in Golaghat district. The agitators were demanding adequate security for people living on the Assam-Nagaland border. Trains that were delayed included Dibrugarh-Rangiya Express, Jorhat-Guwahati Jan-Shatabdi Express and Lumding-Tinsukia Express. (ends)

Pilot killed as plane on training sortiecrashesPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Indore | Posted: November 19, 2014 9:18 pm | Updated: November 19, 2014 9:22 pm
A pilot was on Wednesday killed and an instructor accompanying him injured when the Madhya Pradesh Flying Club-owned Cessna aircraft they were flying crashed at Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Airport here.
“The Flying Club’s plane Cessna 152, that is used for training purpose, crashed near the boundary wall of the airport while it was on a training sortie,” the Airport’s Acting Director Sanjay Agrawal told PTI.
The pilot Arshad Qureshi, who received serious injuries in the mishap, died later at Mohak High-tech Speciality Hospital.
The two-seater single engine plane was being flown by the club’s instructor Pavandeep Singh and Qureshi, both aged around 30, who were performing the “touch and go” exercise when the mishap occurred, he said.
“The aircraft took off for the first time around 10.39 AM and returned to the airport in ten minutes. It proceeded for another round, but around 10.55 AM it lost contact with the Air Traffic Controller (ATC),” Agrawal said.
Soon, an alert was sounded and fire brigade employees and a rescue team were rushed to search the plane, which was found crashed near the airport’s boundary wall located about 500 meters away from the runway, at 11.10 AM.
The two injured pilots were immediately rushed to hospital, he said.
“The exact reason behind the accident is not yet known,” Flying Club’s Chief Instructor Mandar Mahajan said even as the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has already started probing the incident.
Mahajan denied that Qureshi was a trainee pilot, saying he was a holder of commercial pilot licence and is working for the MP Flying Club.

Overheard on the Hill: How about a White House moatBy Jose A. DelReal November 19 Follow jdelreal

Unique security threats require unique security measures.
Acting Secret Service director Joseph Clancy on Wednesday testified before the House Judiciary Committee, where several lawmakers asked questions about a security breach in September that led to a jumper making his way into the White House.
Rep. Steven Cohen (D-Tenn.), after several questions about the security lapse, had a creative recommendation.
"Would a...moat—" Cohen began.
"Water, six feet around,” Cohen continued, “be kind of attractive and effective?"
It's unclear if Cohen was joking or not.
"Sir, it may be," Clancey responded, unfazed. Clancy went on to explain that the Secret Service is concerned with balancing accessibility to the White House with the historic nature of the building.
"That's our first step, to see if we can do something that would still be appeasing to the eye and keep the historical nature of the White House,” Clancy added.
"Like a higher fence? Because this guy got further in the White House than some of my Republican colleagues have ever gotten," Cohen deadpanned.
Clancy did not outright reject the suggestion but seemed to prefer the higher fence.

Heres why Democrats couldnt run on the economy in 2014By Aaron Blake November 19 Follow @aaronblakewp
The 2014 election was  full of muted issues  that kinda, sorta, maybe, might have tipped the scales in favor of Republicans (Ebola? The Islamic State? Obamacare?). But one issue stands out as particularly odd: The economy.
The economy, after all, is what voters almost always say is their top priority. And Democrats had to be heartened to see eight straight months of more than 200,000 jobs created prior to Nov. 4, an unemployment rate dipping below 6 percent, and a thriving stock market.
The economic picture in the homes of Americans, though, was a far different one. In fact, despite progress at the macro level, Americans' views of their own families' economies were basically unchanged -- even from the doldrums of the economic recession.
The chart below tells the tale as well as anything we've seen.
Democratic pollster Democracy Corps has for years been asking people to rate both their personal finances and the national economy on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being really good and 0 being, well, about how people feel about Congress and Ebola.
You'll notice that one of these lines slopes upward. The other one -- the one that actually matters when it comes to actual votes -- does not.
The macro number (in red) is up to an average of 29 which, while not good, is still better than the single digits in the earliest days of the recession. It's progress.
The personal-finance number, though, as of late October, was stuck at an average of 51. Back at the end of 2009, it was 50, and the lowest it ever got was 44. That's not progress.
Even Obama, while trying to pump up the economic progress during his presidency, acknowledged this uneasy dichotomy. "They don't feel it," Obama said of the economic progress he believes his Administration had made in a "60 Minutes" interview in late September . "And the reason they don't feel it is because incomes and wages are not going up."
In the end, this was a big reason Democrats didn't have something to run on in 2014. And without a cogent argument for the success of the Obama Administration, their voters were left unmotivated and their candidates were left twisting in the wind.

Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant proposes middle-income tax breaksBy Niraj Chokshi November 19 Follow @NirajC
Gov. Phil Bryant explains facets of his 2016 Executive Budget Recommendation before agency and department heads and reporters  on Nov. 17  in Jackson, Miss. Bryant’s budget calls for increasing funding for public education by over $52 million and providing a tax credit for “working Mississippi families.” (Rogelio V. Solis/AP)
Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) wants to give residents making less than $53,000 a tax break.
The credit, a part of his budget proposal that would return nearly $79 million to taxpayers next year, would only be available in years when the state’s finances are strong and projected revenues are expected to grow at least 3 percent. The money would be used to offset income taxes owed.
“I believe the additional money Mississippians will save on taxes will be reinvested in the state’s economy,”  Bryant said in a statement.
He estimates that roughly 300,000 households will save an average of $250 a year under the plan, according to the Associated Press . Examples of residents who could benefit from the tax break include: a married couple with three or more children making up to $52,427 or a single childless individual making less than $14,590.
The tax break would only be available when the state’s rainy-day fund — capped at 7.5 percent of appropriated funds — is full.
That reserve-fund limit ranks among the middle of the pack of states that impose caps based on year-end surpluses, according to data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the National Conference of State Legislatures. A handful of states set a 5 percent cap, while a number set caps at 10 percent or more. Some have no such cap.
In a July report , the Pew Charitable Trusts reviewed state rainy day funds and recommended that the size of such funds be based on how volatile tax revenues are. Mississippi ranked among the 10 least-volatile states, based on the standard deviation of annual changes to total tax revenues from 1994 to 2012. Most state caps fall somewhere in the 5 percent to 15 percent of general fund revenues range, according to NCSL .
Bryant’s budget also calls for a nearly $53 million increase in K-12 education spending, bringing the state’s Mississippi Adequate Education Program funding total to nearly $2.2 billion. That increased funding would go to early-learning efforts, student financial aid, teacher training and teacher pay raises of $2,500.

Don Lemons irresponsible armchair quarterbackingDon Lemon attends the “2014 CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute” at the American Museum of Natural History on Tuesday in New York. (Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images)
Armchair quarterbacks are an infuriating breed.
There are few things worse than someone who just met you moments ago who suddenly understands Exactly What You’ve Been Doing Wrong. Such people are numerous. They are relentless. Their solutions are always both deceptively simple and perfectly impossible. “Did it never occur to you,” these people ask, “that what you should have done was USE YOUR MAGIC?”
“No,” you say.
“Why not?”
You gulp. “Because,” you say. “Because. Obviously.”
Armchair quarterbacks are frustrating enough when their opinions are limited to football, or parenting, or even your career choices. Never mind talking about an experience like rape.
But Don Lemon of CNN has gone and done it . “You know,” he told Joan Tarshis, an alleged victim of Bill Cosby, “there are ways not to perform oral sex if you don’t want to do it.”
“Oh,” Joan said. “Um. I was kind of stoned at the time, and quite honestly, that didn’t even enter my mind.”
But Lemon did not stop talking. Clearly, he seemed to think, the trouble was that he had not offered enough detail. He went on to make certain Tarshis understood exactly, specifically what he was talking about.
Asking a question like that — “Hey, you know what you should have tried?” — is just irresponsible. It sets the blame squarely in the wrong camp. It’s a cousin of “What were you wearing?” and “Why did you have so much to drink, then?” Those are so far from being the questions that matter that light takes eight minutes to reach them. It’s your fault, those questions imply. It was on you to prevent this. No. No, it wasn’t. No.
It’s especially strange and stunning because Lemon has come forward as a survivor of sexual abuse . This just seems like a truly irresponsible way of framing this conversation, especially when you have a captive audience of millions of CNN viewers still wondering what became of that durned plane.
Understandably, the Internet was upset. Twitter flocked to the hashtag #DonLemonReporting , taking the premise and rhapsodizing on it, with Lemon offering advice to President Lincoln (“I’m not saying wear a helmet every time you go out, but if Lincoln wore one that night, he gets to see the whole play,” @JRehling quipped ) and the Hindenburg (“Yes, but the Hindenburg could have just turned left, did anyone think to turn left?” asked @Owillis ) among others.
That’s exactly how ridiculous it is.
“I had to ask,” Lemon concluded Tuesday night.
No, you didn’t. There are ways not to ask questions like that, if you don’t want to do it.
But you know how frustrating that is to hear.

Daily Shows Jon Stewart bashes Nancy Pelosi all night longJust last Friday night, Bill O’Reilly of Fox News introduced interviewee Jon Stewart of “The Daily Show” as a “big-time liberal commentator.” Fair enough.
Do not, however, call Stewart a “partisan commentator,” at least not after last night’s edition of Stewart’s Comedy Central program. That’s because he blew a new gasket in the reputation of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. In two separate segments.
In a bit about Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economist whose recently surfaced remarks about the passage of Obamacare have created a fresh crisis for the Obama administration, he cited Pelosi’s apparent selective amnesia. “I don’t know who he is,” Pelosi responded when asked recently about Gruber’s comments — even though Pelosi had cited Gruber as an authority on health-care economics. “Can you ever not disappoint us?” asked Stewart.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that she didn't know who Jonathan Gruber is, but she spoke about him in 2009 in footage surfaced by CSPAN. (CSPAN)
That jab was a caress compared with the treatment accorded to Pelosi in a separate segment, this time on her decision to deny a request from Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) to vote by proxy in House leadership elections because she is pregnant. The minority leader defended the decision by saying , “You’re going to establish a situation where you’re going to determine who has a note from the doctor that’s valid … It’s really a place we shouldn’t go down.”
Here, Stewart’s “big-time liberal” leanings put him at odds with the House’s leading Democrat, and he feasted. His takedown of Pelosi’s denial of a pregnant woman’s vote in House Democratic elections proceeds in merciless fashion. Availing himself of Pelosi’s trail of accomplishments over the years, he documented how she has established herself on key issues that bear on the Duckworth situation. For instance: The National Partnership for Women and Families, noted Stewart, celebrated Pelosi’s advocacy for “working women.” Also highlighted by Stewart: Pelosi said at an event for the Voting Rights Act, “The right to vote must be the cornerstone of our democracy.”
Stewart: “You’re a recognized champion of working women and voting rights.”
From there, the rip was easy: “You rejected, you’re suppressing the vote of a minority pregnant woman who is a wounded war veteran. She is everything you supposedly stand for stuffed into one individual. She is a Democratic demographic tur-Duckworth,” said the host.
To explain why Pelosi would stiff Duckworth on this front, Stewart showed footage of pundits — including Washington Post reporter Ed O’Keefe — explaining the political backdrop: Duckworth and Pelosi are at odds over who should get the top Democratic seat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee . Which prompted Stewart to say, “And that’s how the precedent was set, that a woman leader can be every bit as politically craven as her male counterparts.”

Ninth execution in Missouri this year in what activists say was racially biased caseBy Emily Wax-Thibodeaux November 19 Follow @emily_wax

The man who killed a suburban Kansas City, Mo., gas station attendant in front of the worker’s 8-year-old stepdaughter in 1994 was put to death just past midnight on Wednesday at the state prison in Bonne Terre, the ninth execution in the Missouri this year.
With Leon Taylor’s death by lethal injection, 2014 ties 1999 for having the most executions in a year in Missouri. The execution came amid racial tension in the state over the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
His attorneys rushed to try to stop the sentence. Their court appeals claimed the death penalty was unfair in the case for a variety of reasons, including the racial make-up of the jury.
Taylor’s original jury was deadlocked, and a judge sentenced him to death. When that sentence was thrown out, an all-white jury gave Taylor, an African American, the death sentence.
In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a judge who imposed a death sentence after a jury recommended life in prison. Taylor’s lawyers argued that a subsequent Missouri Supreme Court ruling led the state to commute at least 10 other death sentences for inmates sentenced by a judge — everyone except Taylor, they said.
“With the backdrop of Ferguson, it’s astonishing that Governor (Jay) Nixon can fail to take seriously real and justified concerns with racial fairness in Leon Taylor’s execution and others that have already taken place,” said Diann Rust-Tierney, Executive Director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (NCADP). “Only through a lethal combination of racial bias, legal loopholes and prosecutorial misconduct can an African-American man be sentenced to death first by a single judge, then by an all-white jury, and have that process be considered fair.
Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D), “should use his office to grant clemency in a case such as this, where we can’t be confident that the process was conducted with the highest integrity,” Rust-Tierney said.
But Taylor’s fate was sealed on Tuesday when Nixon declined to grant clemency. The U.S. Supreme Court also turned declined to stop the execution.
Taylor’s execution went off without any visible complications with the drug or equipment, unlike ones that have gone awry recently in Oklahoma, Ohio and Arizona.
In a final statement, Taylor apologized to victim Robert Newton’s family because “our lives had to entwine so tragically” and thanked his family for their support and love.
“I am also sorry to have brought all of you to this point in my life to witness this and/or participate,” Taylor said. “Stay strong and keep your heads to the sky.”
Speaking to reporters after the execution, Newton’s brother, Dennis Smith, said his family has missed the hard-working man with a hearty laugh for 7,500 days since the killing.
“It would just take a coward to want to hurt someone like him,” Smith said.
Taylor shot Newton in front of Newton’s young  stepdaughter in Independence, Mo. He tried to shoot the girl, too, but the gun jammed.
“She had the gun turned on her,” said Michael Hunt, an assistant Jackson County prosecutor who worked on the case. “It didn’t fire. If it had fired, we’d have had a double homicide.”
In a written statement, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said Taylor “coldly murdered” Newton. “Those who knew and loved Robert Newton waited two decades for the imposition of justice that finally came early this morning,” Koster said.
Among those who sent letters to Nixon seeking clemency were Harvard School of Law Professor Charles Ogletree, the director of The Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice , and Barbara Arnwine, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
“Mr. Taylor is also an appropriate candidate for clemency based on the transformation he has undergone in his time in prison. During his time at Potosi Correctional Center, Mr. Taylor has become active in prison ministry and has become a rock for the Christian community there. He has had no major conduct violations in recent years,” Ogletree wrote.  “Moreover, sometime ago, he reached out to the wife of his victim, Ms. Astrid Hooper and expressed his sincere remorse for his crimes and condolences for her loss.”

Stephen Colbert to host the Kennedy Center HonorsBy Helena Andrews November 19 Follow @helena_andrews

It took nearly six years, but official Washington has finally invited comedian Stephen Colbert back to host one of its glitziest galas.  On Wednesday, the Kennedy Center announced today that the faux conservative talk show host will helm the 37th annual Kennedy Center Honors. The year’s awards ceremony will fete singer Al Green, actor Tom Hanks, ballerina Patricia McBride, musician Sting and actress/comedian Lily Tomlin.
Colbert, who was either the funniest or most controversial White House Correspondents dinner act in recent memory depending on who you ask, stayed in character when told the news. “I am stunned to be receiving a Kennedy Center Honor at such a young age. I thought it would be years before… I’m sorry. I’m being told I am HOSTING the Kennedy Center Honors. Oh…Well, I’m glad. That makes a lot more sense,” he said in a statement released by the Kennedy Center.
Honors producers, father and son team George and Michael Stevens, both praised the mock news show host, calling the D.C.-native an obvious choice who “will no doubt undo any solemnity that might otherwise attend the occasion.” So expect less stuffy and more funny this year.
Colbert is currently wrapping up his final season as host of Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report.” In 2015, the comedian will take the reigns from David Letterman as host of “The Late Show” on CBS. The Honors will be taped on Dec. 7 and broadcast as a CBS primetime special on Dec. 30.

Theres a global warming generation gap in the GOP  like on the issue of gay marriageBy Chris Mooney , Scott Clement and Steven Mufson November 19 Follow chriscmooney Follow @sfcpoll Follow @StevenMufson
(REUTERS/Carlos Barria)
Congressional Republicans want to make fighting the Environmental Protection Agency's climate regulations and President Obama's greenhouse gas reduction targets a centerpiece of their agenda over next two years -- now that they have wrested control of the Senate as well as House.
But how will the politics of that look 10 years from now?
Several commentators have suggested that climate change could become the gay marriage issue of the future for the GOP. In other words, demographic changes within the Republican Party itself and in society in general could leave GOP leaders looking badly out of step with their own constituency and scrambling to switch sides.
Over the past decade, support for gay marriage has grown within the Republican Party, especially as young Republicans grew older and swelled the ranks of the party. Opposition to gay marriage -- and the party's support for a slew of state ballot initiatives banning gay marriage -- may have looked mainstream with the Republican Party 10 years ago, but now looks outdated. "The ballot initiative wins masked the rapidly rising tide of gay acceptance fueled by younger generations," wrote Bill Scher of the Campaign for America's Future, who likens the issue to climate change.
Will the climate change issue really follow the same course? To test that theory, we looked more closely at the data from a series of global warming questions asked by the Washington Post-ABC News poll back in June. In particular, that poll asked a nationally representative sample of respondents whether they believed the federal government "should or should not limit the release of greenhouse gases from existing power plants in an effort to reduce global warming?"
People overwhelmingly supported this idea of doing so, with 70 percent in favor.
Then, a subsequent question asked, "What if that significantly lowered greenhouse gases but raised your monthly energy expenses by 20 dollars a month - in that case do you think the government should or should not limit the release of greenhouse gases?"
This is a harder test, but once again, a majority (63 percent) was willing to spend $ 20 per month to limit greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, although they are more resistant than Democrats and Independents, even a slight majority of Republicans concur:
Support for action to slow climate change (even if it costs something) was also much more widespread among younger voters in the poll. As they become increasingly central to the electorate, the GOP war against the EPA's climate regulations could look shortsighted:
The age gap here is quite significant -- those under 30 are 22 percentage points more supportive than seniors (65+) of government limits on greenhouse gases if they add $20 to their monthly energy bill. It's worth noting that majorities in all age groups supported this in the poll. The age gap on climate is about half the size of the age gap on same-sex marriage -- in the same survey, those under 30 were 39 points more supportive of gay marriage than seniors (77 vs. 38 percent).
The key question, though, is whether even within the GOP, there is a split between younger and older voters on climate change. Sure enough, our poll suggests that this is the case:
What this shows is that age matters above and beyond partisanship in how people think about the climate issue. Roughly six in 10 Republicans and GOP-leaning independents under age 50 think the government should limit greenhouse gases even if it causes a $20 increase in their monthly bill; fewer than half of Republicans ages 50-64 or over 65 support this policy. Support is only slightly higher among Democrats under age 50 than those over age 65, which is statistically insignificant. Support does rise to 78 percent among Democrats under age 40.
It is worth noting that a post-election Pew Research Center poll also showed an age gap among Republicans, albeit smaller than the Post-ABC survey. A 56 percent majority of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents under age 40 supported "setting stricter limits on power plants in order to address climate change," compared with 44 percent of Republicans over age 50, according to breakdowns provided to the Washington Post.
Where does that leave the Republican leadership? Earlier this month, after China and the United States made historic commitments to curtail greenhouse gases, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kty.) took aim at what he called "the President’s ideological War on Coal." House Speaker John Boehner bemoaned "the latest example of the president’s crusade against affordable, reliable energy that is already hurting jobs and squeezing middle-class families.”
They clearly think this is a politically winning line of attack. But as ocean waters rise with climate change, a sea change at work within the GOP may one day wash away today's Republican strategy.

Deadly Defect Air Bag Maker Faces Criminal Probe
Soon-to-retire CBI chief seeks whistleblowers identityinvestigation
“When people hear you are working in CBI, they will start smirking”
With just a few days left for retirement, CBI Director Ranjit Sinha urged the Supreme Court to direct the disclosure of the identity of the whistleblower who leaked the visitors’ register maintained at his residence, so that history does not refer to his organisation with a “smirk.”
The logbook allegedly showed that Mr. Sinha frequently met accused persons involved in the 2G scam at his residence even as the CBI was investigating and prosecuting them.
“The Director has only 15 days to go. What will happen to the CBI? When people hear you are working in CBI, they will start smirking. That is why we want the disclosure of the whistleblower’s identity to the court in a sealed cover,” senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the CBI chief, submitted on Tuesday.
But advocate Prashant Bhushan, lawyer for the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, did not flinch. Instead, lawyer and advocate Kamini Jaiswal, general secretary of the NGO, took personal responsibility.
The exchange became heated when Mr. Bhushan’s lawyer, senior advocate Dushyant Dave, retorted that Mr. Singh only represented the CBI chief, “an individual”, and not the organisation, the CBI.
The exchange comes over two months after Mr. Bhushan first informed the court about the leaked register. He said it was provided by a whistleblower, who wished to remain anonymous. He had sought the removal of Mr. Sinha from the 2G case.

One of the injured pilots is in serious condition.
Two pilots were seriously injured after a training aircraft of the Madhya Pradesh Flying Club crashed at Indore airport on Wednesday.
According to information reaching Bhopal, the incident occurred when the pilots were carrying out what is called a ``touch and go manoeuvre’’.
The two-seater Cessna aircraft crashed about 500 m from the runway.
The injured, assistant pilot instructor Capt Pawandeep Singh Pabla and commercial pilot Arshad Qureshi have been admitted to the Aurobindo Hospital in the city.
PTI adds:
“The Flying Club’s plane Cessna 152, that is used for training purpose, crashed near the boundary wall of the airport while it was on a training sortie,” Airport’s Acting Director Sanjay Agrawal said.
The aircraft took off for the first time around 10.39 a.m. and returned to the airport in ten minutes. It proceeded for another round, but around 10.55 a.m. it lost contact with the Air Traffic Controller (ATC), Agrawal said.
Soon, an alert was sounded and fire brigade employees and a rescue team were rushed in search of the plane, which was found crashed near the airport’s boundary wall located about 500 meters away from the runway at 11.10 AM.
The two injured pilots were immediately taken to Mohak Hightech Speciality Hospital. Qureshi is in a serious condition, Hospital’s Neuro Surgery Department’s Head Dr Shrikant Rege said.
“Qureshi suffered serious injuries on his head, face and both the legs. He has lost a lot of blood as well. We are trying our best to pull him out of the serious condition,” Rege said.
“The exact reason behind the accident is not yet known,” Flying Club’s Chief Instructor Mandar Mahajan said adding, “We are unable to say anything on the issue till our two pilots gain consciousness. The Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) probe would clear the same.”
Mahajan denied that Qureshi was a trainee pilot and added that he is a Commercial Pilot Licence holder and is working for the MP Flying Club.

Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa commutes sentence of all five
The five Indian fishermen on death row in Sri Lanka on drug-trafficking charges, walked free on Wednesday, after President Mahinda Rajapaksa used his executive powers to commute their death penalty.
The five have been released into the care of the Indian High Commission before being sent back to India, an official said. It is learnt that they will serve no further jail term in India. President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s decision on the release appears to be a commutation of the fishermen’s sentence to the term already served.
The gesture, described by the Indian High Commission here as humanitarian, ended three weeks of uncertainty over their fate, after the Colombo High Court sentenced them to death on October 30. It follows intense diplomatic activity, which saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking to Mr. Rajapaksa on November 9, and several behind-the-scenes talks.
The five fishermen — Emerson, P. Augustus, R. Wilson, K. Prasath and J. Langlet, all hailing from Tamil Nadu — were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy in November 2011. Three Sri Lankan fishermen were also sentenced to death with them.
In addition to New Delhi taking up the Indian fishermen’s case through diplomatic channels, an appeal was filed on their behalf in the Colombo High Court on November 11.
While the diplomatic negotiations were on, the President’s office announced that the withdrawal of the appeal by the Indian side was a pre-requisite for any decision on the release.
Meanwhile, it appears that the Sri Lankan fishermen’s sentence stands. The three fishermen have not withdrawn their appeal, The Hindu learns from sources in Colombo’s legal circles.
The President’s decision to free the Indian fishermen comes at a time when Sri Lanka awaits a proclamation on Presidential elections widely expected to be held early January.
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), a party of Buddhist monks, has been consistently voicing concern over drug smuggling and the government’s inability to curb it. The JHU (National Heritage Party) on Tuesday quit President Rajapaksa’s government, protesting the reluctance to implement constitutional changes.

Chennaiyin FC put up all-round show to beat Pune City FC  top points tablePrint

Chennaiyin FC produced a crushing performance to beat Pune City FC 3-1 as they pipped Atletico de Kolkata to the top spot in the points table of the Indian Super League, in Chennai on Wednesday.
Courtesy strikes from Stiven Mendoza Valencia (62nd minute), Bruno Pelissari (70th min) and India international Jeje Lalpeklhua (90th min), Chennayin moved right on top of the table with 16 points.
The Abhishek Bachchan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni co-owned team are on top having scored more goals than ATK, who are on second position, with same number of points.
For Pune, it was an unfortunate own goal by Chennaiyin’s Cameroonian mideo Eric Djemba Djemba, that had given them some hope before the final burst from ‘Blues’ buried them.
The hero of the match undoubtedly was young Balwant Singh, whose assist was key to two of the three goals scored by Chennai and he repeatedly switched flanks to keep the Pune players at bay.
During the first half, it was Chennaiyin, who dominated the proceedings with better ball possession.
In fact, it was Pune custodian Arindam Bhattacharya, who pulled off a stunning save in the 10th minute which was pure reflex work.
It was Chennaiyin’s best player Elano taking a perfect corner that fell into the melee and Jeje was quick to execute a backheel. The big-bodied Arindam was moving towards his left but arched his body back and stretched his right hand to avert the danger.
Elano, who did not look fully fit was taken off by coach Marco Materazzi along with Gourmangi Singh, who sustained a groin injury.
It was Mohun Bagan forward Balwant, who was pressed into action and the Chennayin had a lot of mibility upfront.
Chennayin’s first goal in the 62nd minute was a combination of a four-touch finish.
It was Mendoza, who received the ball on the left side of the central midfield. He quickly passed it onto Djemba Djemba and went on the overlap. The former Manchester United player’s first touch was for Balwant, who essayed a killer through pass that found Mendoza in the open.
While Arindam left his charge to narrow the angle, the Colombian placed it in with a deft chip.
In the 69th minute, Pune equalized against the run of play as Jermaine Pennant passed one to David Colomba, whose low shot saw Djemba Djemba deflect it into his own goal with goalkeeper Gennaro Bracigliano complete caught off-guard.
However Pune’s joy was shortlived as Chennayin again surged ahead in the very next minute much to the delight of the partisan capacity crowd.
It was the two Brunos from either side — Pelissari and Cirillo involved in the goal.
Chennayin Bruno Pellisari marched towards opposition goal before unleashing a powerful left-footer which deflected off Bruno Cirillo’s body to change direction and there was very little that Arindam could have done in this occasion.
The third and final goal was solely created by Balwant, who was a livewire down wide right as opposition defender Anupam Sarkar could only pull his jersey or shorts in a bid to stop the fleet-footed striker.
It was at continued…

Kerala: Senior IAS officers house raided in DA casePrint
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: November 19, 2014 9:57 pm | Updated: November 20, 2014 3:11 am
Kerala Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) held raids on the premises of senior IAS officer and public works secretary T O Sooraj after the agency registered a case against him in connection with amassing wealth disproportionate to his source of income.
Separate vigilance teams raided his office in the state secretariat, his houses and properties of family members and relatives. Known as a powerful bureaucrat in Kerala, Sooraj is close to North Kerala lobby in CPI (M) and Indian Union Muslim League.
Recently, the Vigilance has registered a case against Sooraj in connection with amassing assets disproportionate to his known source of income. The raids were as a sequel to the case.
Vigilance sources said the search teams have seized documents showing his properties in several parts of Kerala. Besides, they have recovered hard currency of Rs 15 lakh from the officer’s house.
The judicial commission, which probed into the Marad Hindu carnage of 2003, had recommended that action should be taken against Sooraj, then Kozhikode district collector, for his failure in discharging duties.
However, the previous UDF government did not take any action against Sooraj, who had been working in Industries Department under Indian Union Muslim League.  During the previous LDF regime also, he continued in the same ministry of Industries, then headed by CPI (M) minister Elamaram Kareem.

Two Kerala-born Indian Catholics to be declared as saints in VaticanPrint
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: November 20, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 20, 2014 2:08 am
Two Kerala-born Indian Catholics will be declared as Saints in Vatican on November 23. Fr Kuriakose Elias Chavara and Sister Euphrasia, both now in the category of Blessed which is a stage closer to sainthood, would be canonized into the league of saints by Pope Francis in a function at St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Clergy and laity from Kerala would join in Vatican to witness the event.
Chavara, who lived in the 19th century in Kerala, is reckoned as a social reformer and visionary priest. Chavara was declared as a blessed in 1986 along with sister Alphonsa, who was made a saint in 2008.
Chavara is credited with introducing several reforms in Kerala and Syrian Catholic Church as well. He was was born in 1805 at Kainakari in Alappuzha district. After religious studies, he was ordained as a priest in 1829. Since then, Chavara had continuous interventions in religious and intellectual realms of life until death in 1871.
As a priest, he tried to popularize the Sunday sermon in churches and retreat for laymen. One of the most significant attempts was founding of the first Indian congregation for men, which was Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI), and the women congregation Carmelites of Mother Carmel (CMC).
In 1846, he started the first printing press at his monastery at Mannanam in Kottayam. Later, the press was used for bringing out the first Malayalam daily Nasrani Deepika at the behest of Chavara.
In 1861, Chavara was made the first vicar-general of the Syrian Catholic community in Kerala. As the head of the Church, Chavara prevented the laity from schism in the community and retained them under a single fold. He also started the system of seminary for training priests, instead of novices attending classes under various individual teachers.
His pioneering contribution to Kerala society was “school along with church’ . In 1864, he had issued a decree to start pallukoodam (school) along with every palli (church). This direction, later, led to the establishment of schools beside a church, a practice continued even now.
Chavara started a special school for weaker sections in society and opened the first boarding school for girls at Koonammavu near Paravoor. Later, he also took steps for opening destitute home for orphans and aged people.
When Syrian Christians in Kerala were under bishops from foreign missionaries , Chavara wrote to Rome for the need for making local priests as head of the Syrian Church. This move later led to the formation of separate dioceses for Syrian Catholics.
Chavara died in 1871 and was buried at St Philomina’s Church at Koonammavu in Ernakulam district. Later, his moral remains were taken to the monastery he had established at Mannanam in Kottayam. His canonization process was started in 1957 and was elevated as Venerable in 1984 as the faithful started reported about miracles received at the intercession of the late priest. In 1986, he was declared as blessed by Pope John Paul II during his Indian visit.
The final sainthood is conferred continued…

Girl killed allegedly by parents for inter-caste marriagePrint

In a suspected case of honour killing, a 21-year-old girl was allegedly murdered in the capital by her parents who opposed her marriage to a youth belonging to a different caste. The deceased, identified as Bhawna Yadav, a final year student of Sanskrit Honours at Venkateswara College, was allegedly strangled to death by her parents Jagmohan Yadav, a property dealer and his wife Savitri, on Saturday night at their house in Bharat Vihar, Kakrola in South West Delhi, police said.
“They took her body to Alwar, Rajasthan, where they burnt it at their ancestral village. We have arrested the parents and further investigations are underway,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (South-West) Suman Goyal. Bhawna and Abhishek Seth (24), who is a government official, had met each other at Venkateswara College in August 2012 through a common friend.
They fell in love and wanted to marry each other but knew that their parents won’t approve of their relationship, police said. The young couple, however, got married on November 12 at the Arya Samaj Mandir at Mandir Marg in New Delhi. Abhishek then took Bhawna to his home in Uttam Nagar in West Delhi where his parents accepted their marriage, they said.
According to Abhishek, Bhawna’s parents reached his home that very night and said that they would get them married in a grand function and took their daughter with them. “However, once they returned home, they told Bhawna that they don’t accept this marriage and they would get her married as per their wish. Bhawna then returned to my place on November 14. Her parents again visited our house with some neighbours and assured that they would do a ‘chunni ceremony’ (engagement ceremony) at their home and send my wife back on Sunday,” said Abhishek.
However, on Saturday night, Abhishek got a call from Bhawna’s maternal uncle Lakhan who allegedly threatened to kill both of them. “Minutes later, I got a call from Bhawna that her uncle was drunk and he should ignore him. The next morning, repeated calls on Bhawna and her parent’s number went unanswered. Sometime later, I got a call from her cousin Sachin who informed me that Bhawna was cremated in Alwar, following which I approached police,” said Abhishek in his police complaint.
One of Bhawna’s neighbour Mahinder told police that her parents told him that she was bitten by a snake and he drove them to their ancestral place in Alwar in his car for some ‘tantrik rituals’ to get her cured. “Mahinder told us that Bhawna appeared to be dead when she was kept in his car,” the police continued…

Over 200, including mediapersons, injured; godman still elusive
Self-styled godman Sant Rampal’s ashram in Hisar turned into a war zone on Tuesday when hundreds of policemen and Rampal’s followers fought a pitched battle, as the police tried to enter the ashram to arrest the godman. The violence left over 200 injured, including some mediapersons.
The police who wanted to execute a warrant against Rampal, used tear gas, water cannon and lathicharged Rampal’s followers, who responded by firing gunshots and throwing Molotov cocktails and acid pouches.
Even as the policemen and followers were engaged in a clash, the police turned their lathis on media personnel standing hundreds of metres away from the scene. Several journalists and TV crew members were injured and cameras and other equipment damaged. Haryana Director-General of Police S.N. Vashisht, who claimed that the godman was “100 per cent” in the ashram, said the day began with the police making announcements over loud speakers in the morning to allow them to enter. Instead, some Rampal supporters doused themselves with diesel and threatened self-immolation.
Mr. Vashisht said the police had to use water cannon to disperse them, triggering a violent reaction from Rampal’s supporters, who threw stones, bricks and petrol bombs from the roof and 25 feet high walls of the ashram.
The police managed to take away 10 busloads of women and children from the spot to safety. They later used earth excavators to break the wall in the rear, but ran into an LPG dump, halting their progress.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced a visa-on-arrival for Fijians and assistance projects that included a Parliament library and doubling the scholarships and training slots in India for people from Fiji.
The lines of credit were part of three agreements signed between the two countries in the presence of the two leaders.
The Pacific Island nation rolled out a red carpet for Mr. Modi, who was received by his counterpart Frank Bainimarama, at the Suva International airport.
Mr. Modi was accorded a ceremonial guard of honour at the airport after which he attended the traditional welcome ceremony at Albert park.
“It is a new day and a new beginning in our relations with Fiji,” Mr. Modi said in a joint appearance with Mr. Bainimarama.
“Fiji could serve as a hub for stronger Indian engagement with Pacific Islands. I see this visit as an opportunity to renew an old relationship and lay the foundation for a strong partnership in the future,” he added.

“We are also prepared to increase cooperation in renewable energy, especially solar and wind energy, and in building capacity to adapt to climate change,” he added.
Mr. Modi also suggested Fijian leaders to invite Bollywood to shoot their films in Fiji to attract more Indian tourists.

Iconic Indian-origin hotel doorman dies in Lanka at 94accomplishment
Kerala-born Kottarapattu Chattu Kuttan served world leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Nixon at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo for 72 years.
Kottarapattu Chattu Kuttan, the legendary hotel doorman, who served world leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Richard Nixon at the famous Galle Face Hotel in Colombo, has died.
The Indian-origin doorman of the country’s iconic hotel, known as Kuttan, passed away peacefully at the age of 94 on Tuesday after a brief illness.
“The iconic doorman at the Galle Face Hotel who made history for being one of the oldest hotel employees in the world. Passed away peacefully in the early hours of 18th November 2014. May his soul rest in peace!,” Galle Face Hotel said on its Facebook page on Kuttan’s death after serving the institution for 72 years.
Sanjeev Gardiner, the hotel’s chairman, said it was a “truly sad day“.
Guests would be greeted at the entrance by the diminutive Kuttan with his palms pressed together in the traditional greeting.
White—haired with a handlebar moustache, the diminutive figure also sported badges from all over the world.
After leaving his village in Trichur district in Kerala at the age of 17, he reached Talaimannar pier in Sri Lanka’s western coast in 1938 looking for a job with just Rs 25 in hand and the clothes he was wearing.
Joining the hotel as a bell boy cum waiter in 1942, he continued to serve until his death, Lanka Mirror reported.
Kuttan, who served dignitaries like Lord Mountbatten, Princess Elizabeth, Emperor Hirohito, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Richard Nixon, celebrated his 91st birthday on February 15.
He has been part of the Galle Face Hotel’s culture from as far back as 1942.
Kuttan virtually became the trade mark of the Sri Lanka’s booming hospitality industry as well as the Galle Face Hotel as his photograph has adorned the cover pages of many travel magazines all over the world.
Kuttan’s Sri Lankan wife, who was a Christian, died some years ago.
He had been ill for his final months but remained on the Galle Face Hotel staff.
The 150—year—old Galle Face Hotel is situated in the heart of Colombo, along the seafront facing the famous Galle Face Green.
The hotel held a minute’s silence as a tribute to Kuttan.
A hotel press release, paying tribute to Kuttan, said: "Starting his career as a restaurant waiter and then as the hotel’s prestigious usher, Kuttan became an integral part of the hotel. He recognised almost all faces of frequent visitors and was a hit amongst the many guests of the hotel.
His welcoming broad smile and hands raised to say "Ayubowan" (may you live longer), was always a symbolic sight at Galle Face Hotel."

Chennaiyin FC produced a crushing performance to beat Pune City FC 3-1 as they pipped Atletico de Kolkata to the top spot in the points table of the Indian Super League, in Chennai on Wednesday.
Courtesy strikes from Stiven Mendoza Valencia (62nd minute), Bruno Pelissari (70th min) and India international Jeje Lalpeklhua (90th min), Chennayin moved right on top of the table with 16 points.
The Abhishek Bachchan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni co-owned team are on top having scored more goals than ATK, who are on second position, with same number of points.
For Pune, it was an unfortunate own goal by Chennaiyin’s Cameroonian mideo Eric Djemba Djemba, that had given them some hope before the final burst from ‘Blues’ buried them.
The hero of the match undoubtedly was young Balwant Singh, whose assist was key to two of the three goals scored by Chennai and he repeatedly switched flanks to keep the Pune players at bay.
During the first half, it was Chennaiyin, who dominated the proceedings with better ball possession.
In fact, it was Pune custodian Arindam Bhattacharya, who pulled off a stunning save in the 10th minute which was pure reflex work.
It was Chennaiyin’s best player Elano taking a perfect corner that fell into the melee and Jeje was quick to execute a backheel. The big-bodied Arindam was moving towards his left but arched his body back and stretched his right hand to avert the danger.
Elano, who did not look fully fit was taken off by coach Marco Materazzi along with Gourmangi Singh, who sustained a groin injury.
It was Mohun Bagan forward Balwant, who was pressed into action and the Chennayin had a lot of mibility upfront.
Chennayin’s first goal in the 62nd minute was a combination of a four-touch finish.
It was Mendoza, who received the ball on the left side of the central midfield. He quickly passed it onto Djemba Djemba and went on the overlap. The former Manchester United player’s first touch was for Balwant, who essayed a killer through pass that found Mendoza in the open.
While Arindam left his charge to narrow the angle, the Colombian placed it in with a deft chip.
In the 69th minute, Pune equalized against the run of play as Jermaine Pennant passed one to David Colomba, whose low shot saw Djemba Djemba deflect it into his own goal with goalkeeper Gennaro Bracigliano complete caught off-guard.
However Pune’s joy was shortlived as Chennayin again surged ahead in the very next minute much to the delight of the partisan capacity crowd.
It was the two Brunos from either side — Pelissari and Cirillo involved in the goal.
Chennayin Bruno Pellisari marched towards opposition goal before unleashing a powerful left-footer which deflected off Bruno Cirillo’s body to change direction and there was very little that Arindam could have done in this occasion.
The third and final goal was solely created by Balwant, who was a livewire down wide right as opposition defender Anupam Sarkar could only pull his jersey or shorts in a bid to stop the fleet-footed striker.

Kerala Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) held raids on the premises of senior IAS officer and public works secretary T O Sooraj after the agency registered a case against him in connection with amassing wealth disproportionate to his source of income.
Separate vigilance teams raided his office in the state secretariat, his houses and properties of family members and relatives. Known as a powerful bureaucrat in Kerala, Sooraj is close to North Kerala lobby in CPI (M) and Indian Union Muslim League.
Recently, the Vigilance has registered a case against Sooraj in connection with amassing assets disproportionate to his known source of income. The raids were as a sequel to the case.
Vigilance sources said the search teams have seized documents showing his properties in several parts of Kerala. Besides, they have recovered hard currency of Rs 15 lakh from the officer’s house.
The judicial commission, which probed into the Marad Hindu carnage of 2003, had recommended that action should be taken against Sooraj, then Kozhikode district collector, for his failure in discharging duties.
However, the previous UDF government did not take any action against Sooraj, who had been working in Industries Department under Indian Union Muslim League.  During the previous LDF regime also, he continued in the same ministry of Industries, then headed by CPI (M) minister Elamaram Kareem.

Two Kerala-born Indian Catholics to be declared as saints inVaticanPrint

Two Kerala-born Indian Catholics will be declared as Saints in Vatican on November 23. Fr Kuriakose Elias Chavara and Sister Euphrasia, both now in the category of Blessed which is a stage closer to sainthood, would be canonized into the league of saints by Pope Francis in a function at St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Clergy and laity from Kerala would join in Vatican to witness the event.
Chavara, who lived in the 19th century in Kerala, is reckoned as a social reformer and visionary priest. Chavara was declared as a blessed in 1986 along with sister Alphonsa, who was made a saint in 2008.
Chavara is credited with introducing several reforms in Kerala and Syrian Catholic Church as well. He was was born in 1805 at Kainakari in Alappuzha district. After religious studies, he was ordained as a priest in 1829. Since then, Chavara had continuous interventions in religious and intellectual realms of life until death in 1871.
As a priest, he tried to popularize the Sunday sermon in churches and retreat for laymen. One of the most significant attempts was founding of the first Indian congregation for men, which was Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI), and the women congregation Carmelites of Mother Carmel (CMC).
In 1846, he started the first printing press at his monastery at Mannanam in Kottayam. Later, the press was used for bringing out the first Malayalam daily Nasrani Deepika at the behest of Chavara.
In 1861, Chavara was made the first vicar-general of the Syrian Catholic community in Kerala. As the head of the Church, Chavara prevented the laity from schism in the community and retained them under a single fold. He also started the system of seminary for training priests, instead of novices attending classes under various individual teachers.
His pioneering contribution to Kerala society was “school along with church’ . In 1864, he had issued a decree to start pallukoodam (school) along with every palli (church). This direction, later, led to the establishment of schools beside a church, a practice continued even now.
Chavara started a special school for weaker sections in society and opened the first boarding school for girls at Koonammavu near Paravoor. Later, he also took steps for opening destitute home for orphans and aged people.
When Syrian Christians in Kerala were under bishops from foreign missionaries , Chavara wrote to Rome for the need for making local priests as head of the Syrian Church. This move later led to the formation of separate dioceses for Syrian Catholics.
Chavara died in 1871 and was buried at St Philomina’s Church at Koonammavu in Ernakulam district. Later, his moral remains were taken to the monastery he had established at Mannanam in Kottayam. His canonization process was started in 1957 and was elevated as Venerable in 1984 as the faithful started reported about miracles received at the intercession of the late priest. In 1986, he was declared as blessed by Pope John Paul II during his Indian visit.
The final sainthood is conferred continued…

US: Washington state gun law leads museum to removeriflesNicole Hockley, left, is embraced by campaign worker Jordan Fuzie after Hockley spoke to volunteers at a phone bank in support of Washington's Initiative 594, a measure seeking universal background checks on gun sales and transfers.

A museum in Washington state is removing World War II-era weapons from an exhibit to avoid violating a new voter-approved law requiring background checks on gun transfers.
Lynden Pioneer Museum Director Troy Luginbill tells The Bellingham Herald that it would be a violation of Initiative 594 to keep the 11 rifles past December 4. The weapons will be returned to the collectors who lent them.
The law exempts antiques, but Luginbill says the rifles are too new to qualify.
State Attorney General Bob Ferguson tells the newspaper that he can’t interpret the law for specific situations.
The rest of the exhibit, which includes vehicles, radios, photos and journals about the war in the Pacific, will be on display at the museum in the city of Lynden until May.
