New Delhi: Alarmed over the Indian government’s proposed amendments to the MGNREGA Act, development economists from India and abroad have written an open letter to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking an assurance against any possible dilution or restriction of the provisions of the job scheme.
Introduced in February, 2006, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), promises 100 days of employment every year to each household in the rural areas.
Appreciating the support that MGNREGA provides to crores of vulnerable and poor rural families, the petitioners argue that scheme had wide-ranging social benefits including creation of jobs and various productive assets (like water reservoirs and check dams).
The gains achieved have been substantial and amply justify further efforts to make it a success, the letter said.
Acknowledging that corruption has been a long standing problem in implementation, the petitioners optimistically said that the malaise could be curbed. Quoting a research, the petitioners said corruption levels had steadily declined over time.
“For instance, official estimates of NREGA employment generation are very close to independent estimates from the second India Human Development Survey. While corruption remains a concern, experience shows that it can be curbed, and the battle against corruption in NREGA has helped to establish new standards of transparency in other social programmes as well,” the letter argues.
The petitioners lamented that wages had been frozen in real terms, and long delays in wage payments had further reduced their real value. The letter alleged that MGNREGA's initial provisions for compensation in the event of delayed payments had also been removed.
“The labour-material ratio is sought to be reduced from 60:40 to 51:49 without any evidence that this would raise the productivity of NREGA works. For the first time, the Central government is imposing caps on NREGA expenditure on state governments, undermining the principle of work on demand,” the letter said.
The petitioners have also highlighted that the Central Government’s proposed amendment aimed at restricting the NREGA to the country's poorest 200 districts runs against a fundamental premise of the Act-gainful employment that affords basic economic security is a human right.
The development economists expressed in their petition that even India's relatively prosperous districts are unlikely to be free from unemployment or poverty in the foreseeable future. The letter was signed by prominent economist including Jayati Ghosh, Jean Drèze, Reetika Khera V. Bhaskar, Dilip Abreu andPranab Bardhan.

Don t succumb to Ebola  hysteria   urges Obama as panic growsDon't succumb to Ebola 'hysteria', urges Obama as panic grows
AFP

US President Barack Obama urged against "hysteria or fear" Saturday in the face of a growing Ebola crisis, as the United Nations spoke of an "encouraging" response to its funding appeal.
The worst-ever outbreak of the deadly virus has so far killed more than 4,500 people, mainly in three West African nations at the epicenter of the outbreak: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Obama's warning came a day after the World Bank warned the battle against the disease was being lost and as the US president named an "Ebola czar" to coordinate Washington's response.
A UN appeal for nearly $1 billion to fight the spread of the disease has so far fallen short, but a spokesman told AFP more money was coming in daily.

Out of $988 million requested a month ago, the UN said Saturday $385.9 million had already been given by a slew of governments and agencies, with a further $225.8 million promised.
"It has been encouraging to see the amount and the speed with which these amounts have been committed," said Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA).
"To be honest, I don't recall during my time at OCHA that we have had such a response within a month for a billion-dollar appeal."
Nevertheless, Laerke said, this wasn't a sign the need for donations had passed.
"Nobody's smiling in this crisis, so I'm not going to go out and clap my hands and say everything is going fine, because it's not," he told AFP.
   
Panic growing
Meanwhile, as panic grows even far from the outbreak's epicenter, Obama counseled patience and perspective.
"This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear -- because that only makes it harder to get people the accurate information they need. We have to be guided by the science," Obama said in his weekly address to the nation.
Friday saw a number of false alarms in the United States as fears grow, including at the Pentagon, where an entrance was closed after a woman vomited in a parking lot. US authorities later found no evidence that she had contracted Ebola.
"We have to remember the basic facts," Obama said Saturday.

The United States -- where a Liberian man died from Ebola on October 8 and two American nurses who treated him have tested positive -- was not seeing an "outbreak" or "epidemic," Obama stressed.
More "isolated" cases in the country were possible, he conceded. "But we know how to wage this fight."
The US president played down the idea of a travel ban from West Africa.
"Trying to seal off an entire region of the world -- if that were even possible -- could actually make the situation worse."
Travelers from affected regions would simply change their travel plans to evade screening, he said, making Ebola even harder to track.
   
'Losing the battle'
Obama's call for calm was in stark contrast to World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim, who warned Friday: "We are losing the battle."
He blamed a lack of international solidarity in efforts to stem the epidemic.
"Certain countries are only worried about their own borders," he told reporters in Paris, as leaders in Washington and beyond grapple for a coordinated response to the outbreak.
Airports in several countries, including in the United States, have launched enhanced health checks in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola, although health experts -- including in the US -- have expressed doubts about their effectiveness.
France on Saturday started carrying out health checks on Air France passengers arriving from Guinea, where the epidemic began in December, while a union of the airline's flight attendants called for a halt in flights from Conakry altogether.
The United States, Britain and Canada have already launched screenings at airports for passengers from Ebola-ravaged zones. The EU is reviewing the matter.
As of October 14, 4,555 people have died from Ebola out of a total of 9,216 cases registered in seven countries, the World Health Organization says.
Symptoms of Ebola include fever, headache, diarrhea, vomiting and in some cases bleeding.
Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear and only through direct contact with their bodily fluids, such as mucus, semen, saliva, vomit, stool or blood.
There is no licensed treatment or vaccine for the contagious disease, but several countries are trying to develop an effective vaccine.

Modi govt deregulates diesel: Six key things you want to know about the reform pushComments
The Centre announced on Saturday that it would lift controls on diesel pricing with immediate effect in a move that led to an immediate fall in pump prices of nearly 6%. Here are six things you want to know about the move.
People agree that market-determined diesel prices free of administrative control would cut subsidies.
The cut
Diesel price goes down Rs. 3.37 with immediate effect
Why it's big?
# The government has deregulated diesel prices
# Now, oil companies will fix pump price of diesel according to crude price costs
# Diesel price will go up if crude prices rise; will fall in crude becomes cheaper
# Petrol price is already market-determined and change every fortnight
How was it earlier?
# The government fixed diesel price
# Oil companies often used to sell diesel at a loss
# The government used to subsidise oil companies to cover for this loss and keep retail diesel prices low
What led to it?
# Global crude oil prices have fallen to $84 a barrel, a fall of nearly 25% in the last six weeks
# This has helped oil companies to fully wipe out the losses on diesel price
# Since January 2013, diesel rates have cumulatively risen by Rs. 11.81 a litre in 19 instalments
# Rates of diesel were last raised on August 31 after which losses have dipped
In Delhi price of diesel expected to go down by Rs. 3.37 effective midnight tonight: Arun Jaitley pic.twitter.com/BxtxZQ7iZh
What's in it for you?
# Fuel bills will come down or rise depending on crude oil prices
# Diesel price, like that of petrol, will likely change every fortnight
# Deregulation will push private companies like Essar and RIL to open fuel stations
# Consumers will have more choice; competition will keep prices in check
Why is fuel deregulation important?
# Market-determined fuel prices would cut subsidies
# Lower subsidy bill will help govt cut taxes on petro products
# This will help offset the shocks when global crude prices shoot up

Bring black money back or quit: Digvijaya to ModiComments
All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Digvijaya Singh said on Saturday that either Prime Minister Narendra Modi should keep his promise to bring black money back from abroad or step down from his post.

Talking to the media at his residence in Bhopal, Singh said Modi had promised during Lok Sabha elections that he would bring back the black money and give Rs. 3 lakh to every citizen of the country.
"As he had promised to people, he should bring back the black money and if not to every person, he should give Rs. 3 lakh to every such person who is not an income tax payee," said Singh.
He said Baba Ramdev and Narendra Modi misled people of the country by saying that a huge amount of black money has been stashed in banks abroad.
In reply to a query on the Centre not being able to disclose the names of those who had stashed black money abroad, he said, "This is what we were saying. Until there is an agreement between two countries and there are changes in law and rules of those (foreign) countries, this cannot happen."
He admitted that black money stashed in foreign banks is a big issue and it should be brought back to the country.
Talking about RSS agenda on Ram temple, he said they had nothing to do with Ram temple. "Kursi hi unka Ram Mandir hai," he said.
On Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) exam scam, he said the matter is pending in high court and the chief justice is monitoring the case. He also said income tax department's raid on two influential people revealed names of beneficiaries who included ministers, government officials and BJP and RSS leaders. The inquiry was later handed over to Lokayukta. He would find out the status of the case. 
He said his next disclosure would be on Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission (MPPSC) scam. He is also studying the issue of mining. He said he wants an inquiry into the mining lease granted during his (Digvijaya’s) regime and that of the BJP to know if the lease permissions granted were legal or illegal.

Jayalalithaa out of jail after 21 days  gets rousing welcome in ChennaiFormer Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa arrived in Chennai on Saturday by a special aircraft on being released from the Bangalore jail after the Supreme Court granted her bail.
AIADMK cadres were jubilant and celebrated the release of Jayalalithaa, who spent 21 days in prison.
The moment Jayalalithaa emerged from the central jail compound in Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore, at 3.10pm, Tamil Nadu chief minister O Pannerselvam threw himself flat on the road in front of the main gate — face down, hands folded in prayer.
As many as 300 AIADMK ministers, MLAs and MPS who were standing behind Panneerselvam, took off their slippers and went down on all fours. Their spotless white shirts and lungis were smeared with mud and slush; it had rained heavily just a few minutes earlier.

The only person, whose presence Jayalalithaa acknowledged before she zoomed off in her imported SUV, was Panneerselvam.
"For a moment, I thought he (Pannerselvam) slipped and fell. My first instinct was to pick him up but I quickly realised that he was paying his respects," said a lady Karnataka cadre IPS officer who was a witness to the scene.
From the jail, Jayalalithaa left in a cavalcade of around 30 vehicles toward the HAL airport where she took a flight to Chennai.
Moments after she left, her supporters broke the police cordon and approached the media flashing victory signs. In voices choking with emotion, they cried out in chorus: "Amma..Amma." The police chased them away with a mild baton charge.
Earlier, at noon, special court judge Michael Cunha, issued the release order after Jayalalithaa's legal team furnished two bonds of Rs. 1 crore each. Similar bonds were executed for the release of her other three associates: Sasikala Natarajan, V Sudhakaran and J Elavarisi.
Watch: Security tightened outside jail ahead of Jayalalitha's release
A special court September 27 convicted Jayalalithaa in a Rs. 66.65-crore disproportionate assets case and sentenced her to four years simple imprisonment, with a fine of Rs. 100 crore under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Her three associates -- Natarajan, Sudhakaran and Elavarisi, who were released along with her from the jail, accompanied her.
The trio was also granted bail by the apex court in the same graft case, in which they were also convicted and sentenced to four years jail term with a fine of Rs. 10 crore each.
— Vishakha Saxena (@saxenavishakha) October 18, 2014
"Jayalalithaa left the jail after completing the formalities. She is fine and in good health," Karnataka inspector general of Prisons (IGP) KV Gagandeep told IANS minutes after she walked free at 3.15pm and waved to the crowd at Parapanna Agrahara on Bangalore's outskirt.
A special court ordered Jayalalithaa's release after the Supreme Court Friday granted her an interim bail in the corruption case.
"The special court judge (John Michael D'Cunha) issued the order after Jayalalithaa's counsel furnished a bond of Rs. 2 crore and two sureties of assets were submitted by her known persons," Gagandeep said.
The two sureties of properties valued at Rs. 5 crore and Rs.1 crore were given by J Bharat and Gunajyothi, who are party cadres in the Chennai.
The release order was issued after Jayalalithaa's counsel submitted to the court a certified copy of the apex court order, suspending her four-year jail term and granting her an interim bail till December 18.
Hundreds of Jayalalithaa's ardent fans and frenzied supporters from Chennai and Hosur across the border lined up on both sides of the Bangalore thoroughfares and cheered her as her convoy sped away towards the airport.
Many AIADMK cadres danced, clapped and waived party flags, while others burst firecrackers at junctions en-route raising slogans in favour of their aamma' (mother) and denouncing at the same time DMK president M. Karunanidhi.
Ecstatic supporters welcomed Jayalalithaa in Chennai.
AIADMK cadres assembled in large numbers shouted 'Long Live Amma'.
Jayalalithaa drove straight to her residence in Poes Garden area. Party cadres - men and women - braving heavy rains were assembled outside her residence and the airport to have a glimpse of their leader.
Film starlet Vidya told Jaya TV that Amma is for Makkal and Makkal are for Amma (Amma is for people and people are for Amma) to sum up the general sentiments of the people. Shock, anger, sadness after Jayalalithaa was jailed gave way to unalloyed pleasure and happiness, that exploded into noisy celebrations.
Right from the morning, Poes Gardens was the scene of festivities and much slogan shouting for their supreme leader. “Puratchi thalaivi, vazhga vazhga” (revolutionary leader, zindabad zindabad) rent the air every time a camera focused on the crowds.
Manikandan S, a farmer and AIADMK worker from Cauvery region, said “she had done a lot for farmers. Her hardship is unbearable for us and we will do anything for her.”
Some 1,000 people crowded the airport arrival area and lined up on either side of the road for a darshan of Amma, who spent 21 days in Bangalore prison.
Thousands of people were out on the street, at airport, along the route and at her residence, braving the intermittent rain for better part of the day. Even Jayalalithaa’s convoy passed through water logged road near Kotturpuram, where it slowed down in front of a Vinayaka temple.
Jayalalithaa was seen bowing her head slightly and folded her hands in namaskaram (salutation) to the presiding diety of the temple – Lord Vinayak. She had prayed in the same temple before heading to Bangalore for judgement in the disproportionate assets case on September 27.

Govt de-regulates diesel prices | Gas price hiked to $5.61/unitGovernment deregulates diesel; prices to be linked to market
ET Bureau Oct 19, 2014, 04.49AM IST

Arun Jaitley
(Rs 3.37  a litre cut…)
NEW DELHI: The government announced its biggest reform yet as it decontrolled diesel, which will immediately become cheaper by Rs 3.35 a litre, raised gas prices to $5.61 a unit from next month and said cooking gas customers in 54 districts will get subsidy in their bank accounts from next month even if they do not have an Aadhaar card.
The gas price is based on a new formula that excludes costly LNG prices from the calculation, making the increase 75% lower than the price from the Rangarajan formula, which would have doubled the rate to $8.4 per unit. The UPA regime had cleared the Rangarajan price but the Election Commission had blocked it. The government also announced a premium, to be calculated later, on the price of gas from future discoveries in challenging areas like deep-water, and highpressure or high-temperature zones.
Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Reliance Industries will still get the current rate of $4.2 per unit from its producing fields in the KG-D6 block because the company is in arbitration with the government. "Customers of KG-D6 gas will have to pay the new price. But the operator will get the old price for their gas, which is $4.2 per unit. The difference will be kept in a gas pool account operated by Gail India until arbitration is over," Pradhan said.
The long-awaited reform in diesel prices, which will make the fuel cheaper for the first time in five years, along with renewed efforts to target cooking gas subsidy, will help control the subsidy burden, help finance minister Arun Jaitley control the fiscal deficit and catalyse the fuel retailing sector, where Reliance Industries, Essar Oil and Shell India will challenge the near-monopoly of state-run firms in the sector.
The price of natural gas, currently $4.2 a unit, has been increased by a much smaller extent than the UPA government's unimplemented decision to double it to $8.4 per unit. Prices will be revised once in six months. The new price is in the range of what the power ministry had sought but below what the exploration industry deems attractive to spend big money in the hunt for new fields.
Essar Oil welcomed the deregulation of diesel. LK Gupta, MD & CEO, Essar Oil, said: " We welcome the government's decision to deregulate diesel. This will not only help in controlling the fiscal deficit, but also be advantageous for consumers as they will now pay market rates for the fuel which is lower by more than Rs 3 per litre . This will also leave more money with upstream companies for investment in exploration & production, thereby enhancing our efforts for energy security for the country." The hike in natural gas price will raise compressed natural gas (CNG) used in automobiles by Rs 4.25 per unit in Delhi and piped natural gas (PNG) by Rs 2.6 per unit.

Burdwan: NIA faces flak for using teen to locate IEDsThe National Investigation Agency (NIA) was facing a tide of criticism on Saturday, two days after its officers reportedly employed a 13-year-old boy to peep into a “secret chamber” inside a Burdwan house and open concealed bags full of explosives.
 
The agency recovered 39 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and chemicals from the Badsahi Road residence of a person identified as Rezaul Sheikh where a blast killed two people on October 2.
 
The boy was made to crawl into a tight space over a bathroom, a gap too narrow for NIA and police personnel to navigate, and open the sacks, sources said.
 
“Children are used by the state, centre and militant groups for all the wrong reasons. This is a violation of child rights and a child’s life cannot be put in danger while an investigating agency is probing a bomb blast. The people who are responsible for this, should be booked under cases of cruelty,” said Delhi-based child rights activist Bharti Ali. “At a time when the centre is reviewing the Juvenile Justice Bill, one has to be sensitive to these aspects.”
 
NSG commandos, who were assisting the NIA, stood guard over the explosives all night which were destroyed on Friday morning under expert supervision.
 
Ali said if the NIA officials did not inform the boy that he could be handling explosives, they were guilty of fraud and cheating.
 
“I am going to speak to the chairperson of the child welfare committee and take cognisance of the matter as the boy’s life was at stake,” said Shashi Panja, women and child development minister of West Bengal.

Cabinet committee
(The govt approved a DoT proposal…)
NEW DELHI: The government today approved a DoT proposal for providing one-time financial support to state-run telecom company MTNL for meeting liabilities arising from levy of minimum alternate tax (MAT).
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs ( CCEA ), which is headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has given it approval to the proposal, an official statement said today.
"This decision will help MTNL keep floating in the highly competitive telecom sector. It will also help MTNL arrange finances to meet its basic financial commitments like operations and maintenance of their telecom network," it added.
MTNL reported a book profit of Rs 2,348.49 crore for 2013-14, resulting in a MAT liability of Rs 492.26 crore.
The objective of this approval is providing a one-time financial support to MTNL due to reimbursement of MAT during the financial year 2014-15 through requisite budgetary provisions, the statement added.

ISIS terror: Jihadists kill man for  filming HQ ; Kurds thwart militantsIslamic State group jihadists have executed a man in northern Syria they accused of filming their headquarters and displayed his body on a cross, a monitoring group said on Saturday.
   
The man was put to death in the Aleppo province town of Al-Bab on Thursday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
   
His body was then strapped to a makeshift metal cross and hung with a sign reading "Abdullah Al-Bushi. Crime: filming Islamic State headquarters for 500 Turkish lira ($222) per video," the Britain-based group said, citing witnesses on the ground.
   
"Judgement: execution and crucifixion for three days," the sign hung around the man's neck added.
   
IS has carried out repeated executions of those it accuses of spying or diverging from its harsh interpretation of Islam.

The United Nations Security Council on Friday pushed for a bombing campaign in Iraq against Islamic State militants and associated extremist groups to be strengthened and expanded.   Reuters
It has publicly beheaded suspects and hung their bodies from crosses in its own version of crucifixions.
   
Two IS fighters, one just 15, were, meanwhile, themselves executed after being taken prisoner during fighting around the battleground town of Kobane by Arab allies of its Kurdish defenders, the Observatory said.
   
Members of the Liwa Thuwar al-Raqa rebel group carried out the executions in an area west of Kobane, which IS has been trying to seize for more than three weeks.
   
The prisoners were shot in the head from behind, then their bodies riddled with gunfire, said the Britain-based Observatory, which has a wide network of sources inside Syria.
Kurds thwart new jihadist bid to cut off Syria town
Kurdish forces in the Syrian town of Kobane repulsed a new attempt by Islamic State fighters to cut off the border with Turkey Saturday as troops battled the jihadists in neighbouring Iraq.
   
A Kurdish official reported five new US-led strikes around Kobane overnight as the coalition kept up its air support for the town's defenders.
   
But the US military said that while it saw some "encouraging" signs, the strikes might not prevent Kobane's fall and its priority remained the campaign against the Islamic State (IS) group in Iraq.
   
Heavy IS mortar fire hit the Syrian side of the border crossing with Turkey which is the Kurdish fighters' sole avenue for resupply and the only escape route for remaining civilians, Kurdish official Idris Nassen told AFP.
   
The jihadists launched a fierce attack from the east towards the border gate before being pushed back, he added.
   
IS suffered heavy losses in the fighting and was forced to send in reinforcements, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
   
The jihadists lost 21 of their people to air strikes and another 14 in ground fighting on Friday, the Britain-based monitoring group said. The Kurds lost three of their fighters.
   
An AFP correspondent on the Turkish side reported sporadic mortar fire very close to the border crossing on Saturday afternoon.
   
UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura warned earlier this month that about 12,000 civilians remained in and around Kobane and risked "massacre" if the jihadists cut off the border.
   
Kobane district chief Anwar Muslim said Friday that IS sniper and mortar fire was preventing authorities from evacuating civilians caught up in the battle.
   
"Their situation is difficult," he added.
   
Overnight coalition air strikes on IS targets elsewhere in Syria killed 10 civilians, the Observatory said.
   
Seven died in Deir Ezzor province in the east and three more in Hasakeh province in the northeast, said the group, which has a wide network of sources inside the country.
    
'Iraq our main effort' 
    
The US commander overseeing the air war hailed "encouraging" signs in the defence of Kobane, but said the town could still fall and that Iraq remained the coalition's priority.
   
"Iraq is our main effort and it has to be, and the things that we're doing right now in Syria are being done primarily to shape the conditions in Iraq," said General Lloyd Austin.
   
Iraqi government troops are battling IS on two fronts -- in the Anbar provincial capital of Ramadi, west of Baghdad, and near Tikrit, hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein.
   
Ramadi is in a shrinking patch of territory in the predominantly Sunni Arab province where forces loyal to the Shiite-led government still hold ground, and its loss would be a major blow for Baghdad.
   
Iraqi troops have been struggling to retake and hold ground, despite coalition air support.
   
Security in the capital also remains a problem with bombings killing nearly 50 people in the past two days alone.
   
But the Pentagon has insisted Baghdad faces no "imminent threat" from the jihadists.

UN urges Baghdad support
   
The US-led coalition has prioritised the campaign against IS in Iraq because it can work with both government and Kurdish forces on the ground.
   
The UN Security Council on Friday unanimously called for increased support for the Baghdad government in the face of the "vicious string of suicide, vehicle-borne and other attacks" in the capital.
   
In Syria, the coalition refuses to work with the government of President Bashar al-Assad, having sided with the opposition in the country's devastating civil war.
   
Even the Kurdish defenders of Kobane had no direct contact with US officials until last weekend, and Washington only revealed that on Thursday.
   
Previous contacts with the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) had all been handled through intermediaries, as the group has close ties with the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey -- which is on the US terror blacklist.
   
The PYD confirmed on Saturday that its leader Saleh Muslim had met in Paris last Sunday with the US special envoy for Syria Daniel Rubinstein.
   
It said IS attacks on Kobane and Kurdish resistance had been among the topics discussed but made no specific reference to its repeated appeals for weapons for its beleaguered ground forces.
   
The jihadists are well entrenched in a swathe of Iraq and Syria where they declared an Islamic caliphate in June and have unleashed a wave of atrocities.
   
They have included massacres of ethnic minority civilians and captured soldiers, and beheadings of Western aid workers and journalists.
   
In Syria's northern province of Aleppo, IS jihadists on Thursday executed a man they accused of filming their headquarters, and displayed his body on a cross, the Observatory said.
   
Meanwhile, two IS fighters, one just 15, were executed after being captured near Kobane by Arab allies of its Kurdish defenders, the monitoring group said.

US  China look to manage differences and coo...US and China look to manage differences, cooperate against threats

The North Korea nuclear situation, Iran, climate change and counter terrorism, including the effort against Islamic State.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BOSTON: America and China's top diplomats stressed the need to manage differences and cooperate against global threats including Islamic State and Ebola, as they sought to warm the mood between their countries ahead of a summit next month.
"There are many areas that the United States and China are cooperating on, even as we have some differences that we try to manage effectively," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters in Boston on Saturday before a second day of talks with China's State Councilor Yang Jiechi.
He listed areas of cooperation ranging from Afghanistan, the North Korea nuclear situation, Iran, climate change and counter terrorism, including the effort against Islamic State.
Yang said the aim of his visit was prepare the way for a meeting between China's President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Barack Obama in Beijing on Nov. 12 after a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Cooperation forum (APEC).
"We believe that we should continue to work together to deepen our mutual trust and to put our efforts into major areas of cooperation, while on the basis of mutual respect we can properly handle any kind of difference between us," Yang said.
Shared concern about Islamic State offers a rare convergence of security interests for Beijing and Washington, and a break from their more typical enmity on sensitive geopolitical issues, notably in the South China Sea and matters such as cyber spying.
Kerry hosted a dinner for Yang at his Boston townhouse on Friday and a senior State Department official said they spoke "frankly" about ways to manage differences while improving cooperation on global and regional issues.
On Monday, Kerry is to attend the inauguration of Indonesia's newly elected president Joko Widodo in Jakarta, where he is expected to hold bilateral meetings with regional counterparts who share concerns about China's territorial assertiveness in East Asia.
Yang said it was important to cooperate in the Asia-Pacific.
"The Asia-Pacific region is a very important region," he told reporters. "We need to work together to build up even more cooperation between China and the United States in the area because this is the area that has experienced robust economic development."
Analysts familiar with U.S. thinking expect the Boston talks to include discussion of intelligence cooperation, including tracking militant movements and financing.
China has significant energy interests in Iraq and is also troubled by what it says are domestic Islamist militants. Its state media has reported that militants from the western region of Xinjiang, which abuts Pakistan and Afghanistan, have sought training from Islamic State fighters for attacks at home.
Beijing has responded cautiously, though, to a call by U.S. President Barack Obama for a broad coalition to root out Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, saying the world should fight terror but that the sovereignty of countries must be respected.

Wankhede was my best action stunt  jokes Shah Rukh KhanWankhede was my best action stunt, jokes Shah Rukh Khan

Trust Shah Rukh Khan to add drama to anything he does, and call a spade everything but a spade. The mostly self-deprecating star is at it once again.
 
In an interview to YouTube channel, The Viral Fever (TVF), King Khan is seen talking non-stop about all things he knows his controversy-hungry fans will simply love him for: from why he does films with Farah Khan to why he endorses fake products and even about rumours that he 'buys' his awards!
Also read: Still no entry for SRK at Wankhede
The icing on the cake, however, has to be when  he 'opened up' about his scuffle with security guards at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium during an IPL match in 2012. The interview, hosted by Biswapati Sirkar, who shot to fame with an earlier video of TVF -- The Bollywood Aam Aadmi -- where he copied an Indian news anchor particularly infamous for his over-the-top voice, has already gone viral in the virtual space. The video has more than 8 lakh YouTube hits within three days of its release.
When Biswapti, called Arnub, asked Khan to rate his best action performance between "RA.One, Chennai Express and Wankhede Stadium", the actor picked the last option without batting an eyelid. Why?
Because, he said, "the turn on was the fact that I could abuse, I could use bad language, in front of kids -- who are very impressionable -- and scar them for life."
Even if you are not a Shah Rukh Khan fan, don't miss this video just for the sheer fun the witty SRK adds to an already "well-written" interview.

Criticising the government for telling the Supreme Court that all information on black money stashed abroad can't be disclosed, activist Anna Hazare wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday and threatened to launch an agitation if the ill-gotten wealth was not brought back.

"Bringing back black money is an important issue before the nation. If needed, I won't shirk from organising an agitation on this matter," he said in the letter.
 
Reminding Modi of his promise made during Lok Sabha poll campaign about bringing back black money once voted to power, the Gandhian voiced displeasure over the government submitting before the Supreme Court that all information on it received from countries with which India has Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) cannot be disclosed.
 
"I have undertaken many agitations in the last 35 years. They were not against any party or individual but for the benefit of society and country," he said, adding "you (Modi) have a vast experience in power. I am a fakir and don't have any wealth. I will live and die for the country."  
Hazare also said he had written to Modi on the issue of Lokpal in August but was still to receive a reply.

Difficult for Yuvraj  Sehwag to play in next WC due to age factor: Gangulyprint
Former Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly said Saturday that age has caught up with dashing batsmen Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Sigh, ruling out the duo from making the cut in the team that will try to defend their World Cup title.
The tournament will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand from February 14 to March 29 next year.
Have Yuvi and Viru lost the sting due to their age? (File photo)
 
"They were great players, one of the best I have seen but time catches up with everyone and so is the case with Viru and Yuvi," Ganguly said at the Aaj Tak conclave Salaam Cricket here.
Ganguly added that time is running out for the two veterans to stage a comeback into the team.
"It will be difficult for Sehwag and Yuvraj to play in this World Cup because the tournament is so near and Dhoni won't make many changes in the side," added the former left handed batsman who led India to the 2003 World Cup final.
Ganguly, who captained India in 147 One-Day Internationals, feels that India's performance in the upcoming quadrennial event will depend on how Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina perform.
"Virat has done well in overseas conditions. He has played match-winning innings in South Africa and Australia. Lot will depend on him. If he does well India will put up a good show. Raina has done very well recently. He has been consistent but it will also be a challenge for him to carry that form in Australia," concluded the 42-year-old.

Boko Haram agrees to release abducted girls  says NigeriaNigeria says reaches deal with Boko Haram to free abducted girls
By By Felix Onuah and Camillus Eboh | Reuters –  Sat 18 Oct, 2014

By Felix Onuah and Camillus Eboh
ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria said on Friday it had agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram and reached a deal for the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the group six months ago.
There was no immediate confirmation from the rebels, who have wreaked five years of havoc in Africa's top oil producer and triggered an international outcry by seizing the girls from the northeast town of Chibok in April.
"I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded," said the head of Nigeria's military, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, adding the deal had followed three days of talks with the militant sect.
Government spokesman Mike Omeri said the deal covered the release of the captives and Boko Haram had given assurances "that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well".
Their release would be a huge boost for President Goodluck Jonathan, who faces an election next year and has been pilloried at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping and his inability to quell the violence, the biggest security threat to Africa's biggest economy.
The State Department said it "could not independently confirm" a deal had been struck between Nigeria and Boko Haram. The United States is among several Western allies helping Nigeria's military with training and intelligence support to tackle Boko Haram.
State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, however, the United States would welcome an end to hostilities and the return of the schoolgirls.
Apart from one appearance on a Boko Haram video, the girls have not been seen since the brazen night-time raid on the town near the Cameroon border, although police and a parent said last month that one of the victims had been released.
Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as 'Western education is sinful', has killed thousands of people in its fight to create an Islamic caliphate in the vast scrubland of Nigeria's impoverished northeast.
A senior Nigerian security source confirmed the existence of talks but said it remained unclear whether Abuja was negotiating with self-proclaimed movement leader Abubakar Shekau, or another faction within the group.
"Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously," the security source told Reuters.
Several rounds of negotiations have been attempted in recent years but they have never achieved a peace deal, partly because the group is believed to be deeply divided.
"There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire," the source added.
The government was negotiating with Danladi Ahmadu, a man calling himself the secretary-general of Boko Haram, a presidency source said. It was not clear if Ahmadu is part of the same faction as Shekau.
Security sources in neighbouring Chad said Chadian mediators had been involved in the discussions, which were part of a larger deal that led to the release a week ago of 27 hostages, including 10 Chinese workers, kidnapped in Cameroon.
Separately, Cameroon's defence ministry said eight soldiers and 107 Boko Haram militants had been killed in fighting in the far north on Wednesday and Thursday, a region that has suffered regular cross-border raids.

Jayalalithaa released from Bangalore jailJayalalithaa released from Bangalore prison
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News –  Sat 18 Oct, 2014
Print
Bangalore, Oct 18 (IANS) Former Tamil Nadu chief minister J. Jayalalithaa was released from the central jail here after a Bangalore special court ordered her release Saturday, a day after the Supreme Court granted her bail.
"Jayalalithaa has left the jail... after completing the formalities," Karnataka Inspector General of Prisons (IGP) K.V. Gagandeep told IANS.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O. Pannerselvam, a few cabinet ministers and the ruling AIADMK's lawmakers were at the prison to receive her.
Hundreds of fans and party cadres gathered near the jail to greet her. She will drive down to the old airport in the city's eastern suburb to fly back to Chennai, about 350 km from here.
Earlier, Jayalalithaa's lawyers submitted to the judge a certified copy of the apex court order suspending her four-year jail term and granting interim bail till Dec 18. The special court Saturday ordered her release.
A three-judge bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice H.L. Dattu Friday stayed the four-year jail term sentence.
The special court Sep 27 had convicted Jayalalithaa in the Rs.66.65-crore disproportionate assets' case and sentenced her to four years simple imprisonment, with a fine of Rs.100 crore.
The court also issued separate orders to release Jayalalithaa's three associates -- Sasikala Natarajan, V. Sudhakaran and J. Elavarisi, after they furnished a bond of Rs.1 crore each and gave sureties as sought.

6.02 cr bank accounts opened under Jan Dhan ...6.02 crore bank accounts opened under Jan Dhan scheme
PTI Oct 18, 2014, 10.07PM IST
(Jaitley said the new form…)
NEW DELHI: Over six crore bank accounts have been opened so far under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Finance Minister Arun Jaitely said today.
"We have launched the Jan Dhan Yojana and so far under the Jan Dhan Yojana 6.02 crore accounts have been opened. Our target has been 7.5 crore (by January 26, next year)," he told reporters after the Cabinet meeting.

Jayalalithaa returns to a rousing welcome by adoring party workers

AIADMK supporter
(Hundreds of supporters…)
BANGALORE/CHENNAI: "Our Amma has reached home, now no one can do anything to her,'' said an AIADMK supporter who managed to catch a glimpse of a smiling J Jayalalithaa waving to a huge crowd from a car at her Poes Garden residence in Chennai after she was released on bail on Saturday evening.
Hundreds of supporters gathered unmindful of the heavy downpour outside the former Tamil Nadu chief minister's residence to express their solidarity and joy over her return for two months after her sentence was suspended by the Supreme Court in a corruption case on Friday.
Hundreds of cadres and local party leaders had gathered at the Chennai airport too. But after she landed, Jayalalithaa stopped nowhere to receive bouquets or the traditional 'Aarathis' that were brought by women to welcome her.
Jayalalithaa, who left Chennai on September 27 for the judgement in Bangalore, had taken just — about the usual — 20 minutes to reach the Chenani airport from her residence. But on her return, she took three times more as her convoy slowed down for her to wave at the crowds on either side of the route she was taking to reach her residence.
Earlier in the day in Bangalore, Jayalalithaa walked out of the Central Prison in Parappana Agrahara amidst tight security and much fanfare on Saturday afternoon.
In her official car, Jayalalithaa went past police barricades at around 3.18 pm. Sources said a bond for Rs 2 crore and a surety on assets for more than Rs 1 crore was furnished for Jayalalithaa's bail.

Will West Indies miss out on the 2015 World CupTweet
0
Commentator Tony Cozier has said West Indies could fail to send a squad to their upcoming tour of South Africa as well as the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand if the standoff between the West Indies Cricket Board, West Indies Players Association president and CEO Wavell Hinds and the West Indies players' movement spearheaded by ODI captain Dwayne Bravo remains unresolved.
"The BCCI are very upset that the West Indies board and the players should have called off the tour at this stage," Cozier told ESPNcricinfo in a telephone interview from Barbados on Friday. "Now having done that, meaning that this tour is finished, they were scheduled to go to South Africa right after. They've got three Test matches in December, five one-day internationals in January and a Twenty20 and then they are scheduled to move straight from South Africa to the World Cup in Australia in New Zealand. I can't see that happening if the standoff remains."
Tony Cozier says West Indies should have made their stand before the start of the India tour. (BCCI Photo)
Cozier characterized the abandonment of the West Indies tour of India as a "lose-lose situation" and stated that both the players and the board shared responsibility for letting the dispute get out of hand. Cozier believes the players should have made their stand prior to leaving the West Indies for the start of the tour, but that once they were in India the WICB should have intervened after the situation escalated on tour with Bravo calling for the resignation of Hinds.
"The West Indies board really should have got involved and said, 'Look, we can sort this out. Let's wait for the tour to finish, play all the way through and then we'll go with what your demands are. We'll talk about it. If it needs negotiating, we'll agree with that. But we have to talk about it,' not to abandon a very important tour, a very significant tour virtually before it started."
Cozier also lamented that another blow had been delivered to cricket fans in the region now that they can no longer watch their team on tour going up against the reigning World Cup champions. Spectator attendance at grounds throughout the West Indies has been in decline for some time and this latest incident will not help resuscitate what Cozier describes as a waning level of support for West Indies cricket.
"The fact of the matter is that the West Indies, under the ICC rankings for Tests and ODIs, they're eighth in the list and only above Bangladesh and Zimbabwe," Cozier said. "The interest in cricket here in the Caribbean on the field has certainly waned to a large extent. The Test matches against New Zealand, a very good series here back in June, a good tight series New Zealand won 2-1, you looked at the crowds then and you had maybe 200-300 people at the ground. The biggest crowd perhaps was in Barbados where you had about 1000. That just reflects the exasperation of the supporters here in the Caribbean. They can't understand why this should be happening over and over and over. You wonder if they've all given up on it now.
"In any situation when you have an employer against an employee, which is the board and the players, that public sympathy would be inclined more to the employee who happens to be the players and of course they are the ones who go into the middle. They are the stars. All the same, there are other sports which have come up and challenged West Indies cricket, which after all has been the bedrock of unity within the Caribbean for the better part of 120 years. Whether it will continue, well that's another question."

Unions to hold protest against labour laws r...Trade unions to hold joint protest against labour laws reforms

Centre of Indian Trade Unions
(Union leaders said with…)
NEW DELHI: All central trade unions will hold a nationwide stir on December 5 to protest against the labour reforms initiated by the Narendra Modi government.
"Protest rallies will be taken out in all state capitals and in Delhi as the proposed reforms are against the interest of the working class," general secretary of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) Gurudas Dasgupta said.
"The reforms are pro-corporate and anti-worker. The reforms will give rise to low wages and negligible security cover to the workers. A worker can be hired at will and thrown out," he said.
After the proposed amendments, 70 per cent of small and medium enterprises will remain out of the purview of the labour laws, he added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on October 16 unveiled a string of labour reforms, including measures to end 'inspector raj', asserting that ease of doing business is "essential" to ensure 'Make-in-India' campaign is successful.
Union leaders said with the end of the inspection raj, companies who are not implementing the labour laws will stand to benefit the most.
Left parties such as CPI(M) have already slammed the reform measures, saying the Modi government would continue to serve the interests of the employers in the name of labour reforms and its 'Shramev Jayate' programme meant "nothing much" for the working class.
The party has given its support to the protest actions by the central trade unions and national federations of employees against the "anti-worker amendments in labour laws".
The unions are also opposing disinvestment of PSUs and allowing FDI in defence production, railways and insurance , said Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) president A K Padmanabhan.

Aadhar not must for LPG subsidy under modified DBT
PTI Oct 18, 2014, 10.11PM IST
(The subsidy amount will…)
NEW DELHI: Cooking gas (LPG) consumers will be able to get subsidy directly in their bank accounts from November 15 even if they don't have Aadhar numbers, as the government will re-launch the Modified Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
The scheme will be initially re-launched in 54 districts from mid-November and in rest of the country from January 1. The decision was taken at the Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
"The UPA government had only linked it (DBT) to the Aadhaar platform. There were some legal issues including some court orders, which had prevented the effective implementation of the scheme.
"...therefore we have decided that in addition to the Aadhaar platform all those who have a bank account will also get the LPG subsidy in their accounts directly," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said after the Cabinet meeting.
LPG consumers who have opened accounts under the Jan Dhan Yojana too would benefit from the revised scheme. He said over 6 crore such accounts have been opened so far.
He said the scheme will be implemented in a mission mode and "alleviate the hardship of the LPG consumers faced by them in the earlier scheme.... This will ensure that no consumer is denied LPG subsidy for want of Aadhaar number".
The subsidy amount will be fixed by the government, he said, adding that all LPG consumers who join the modified scheme can receive LPG cash subsidy.
"Those who are still left outside the scheme, those who are neither have an Aadhaar identity or a bank account...the cylinder system will be still available for them for some time," Jaitley added.
All LPG consumers, who had already joined the scheme solely based on Aadhaar number, will start getting subsidy in their Aadhaar linked bank accounts after scheme is launched.
LPG consumers will get a grace period of three months during which consumers who have joined the scheme will get subsidy in bank accounts and others will continue to get cylinders at subsidised price.

Ever wonder who the richest person in your neighborhood is? Private wealth consultancy Wealth-X has (almost) figured it out for you by naming the richest person in each of the 50 U.S. states.
There are a few surprises on the list, and 9 of the 50 states don’t have any billionaires. (The deprived states are Utah, New Mexico, Mississippi, Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, South Dakota, Alaska and Wyoming.) Some really wealthy Americans — for example, Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, who has an estimated wealth of around $16.4 billion — don’t make the list because they live in the same state as some even wealthier people. (In Allen’s case, his old friend Bill Gates, who has a net worth of $81.5 billion.)
Also see: 10 things billionaires won’t tell you
The encouraging news: 35 of the 50 individuals on the list are entrepreneurs who made their own fortunes. And, yes, they include investor Warren Buffett of Nebraska, the country’s second richest person; and media mogul and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Only six women made the list. With a net worth of $37.9 billion, Christy Walton is the richest woman in Arkansas, the U.S. and the world; she is the widow of John T. Walton, one of the sons of Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart.
Without further ado, here are the 50 richest people by state:

Go healthy with a moong dal soup1/2 tsp chopped garlic (lehsun)
2 tbsp chopped celery (ajmoda)
2 tbsp cooked barley (jau)
1/2 tbsp cornflour
salt and freshly ground black pepper (kalimirch) powder ) to taste
Method
For the moong dal puree
Wash and soak moong dal for few hours.
Drain, add 2 cups of water, onions and carrots and pressure cook for 1 to 2 whistles.
Allow the steam to escape before opening the lid.
Allow it to cool and blend in a mixer to a smooth puree.
How to proceed
Heat the oil in non-stick pan and saute the onions, garlic and celery for 1 minute.
Add the moong dal puree and bring to boil. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes and stir in the cooked pearl barley, salt and pepper.
Mix the corn flour with 1/4 cup of water and add to the soup.
Simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes. Serve hot
Handy tips:
Add salt while pressure cooking the barley.
Pearl barley is easily available at local chemists. Wash it thoroughly and cook in boiling water like rice.
The water in which barley is cooked is nutritious and rich in antioxidants that help to fight diseases.
It can be used for kneading dough or added to buttermilk or soup.

ISLAMABAD: Unable to determine the identity of a number of people believed to be Indians in Pakistan's custody, the Indian High Commission here has issued an appeal to the people back home to help in their identification.
The Indian High Commission has been informed by the Pakistan government about a number of individuals in their custody and who they believed are Indian nationals.
"The High Commission of India has not been able to establish the national identity of these individuals in the absence of sufficient detail and information of their background and place of permanent residence," according to a High Commission statement.
The High Commission stated that it is keen to establish the antecedents of those in the list who may be Indians.
"Members of the public in India, especially those who may have knowledge of any of these persons from past acquaintance, are requested to share details in this regard with the High Commission of India and the Ministry of External Affairs," the High Commission said in its appeal.

UN Woman launches campaign for gender equalityUN Woman launches campaign in India for gender equality
PTI Oct 18, 2014, 08.23PM IST
(UN Women believes that it…)
NEW DELHI: The UN Women here today launched a campaign, aiming at ensuring greater participation of men in promoting women's rights and gender equality.
"We need boys and men to work with us. 'HeForShe' is a global solidarity movement to end gender inequality by 2030. The goal is to engage men and boys as advocates and agents of change in the effort to achieve equality. When women are empowered, the whole of humanity benefits," UN Women Representative, Rebecca Tavares, said.
The 'HeForShe' campaign in India was launched by Union Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi.
UN Women believes that it is critical to engage all stakeholders in support of women's rights, including the active participation of men and boys.
Emphasising the need for sensitising the youth on issues related to gender equality, Gandhi said, "The WCD ministry has started many initiatives over the last four months to empower women including: the one-stop crisis centres for women, the national mission on malnutrition, and the 'beti bachayo beti padhayo' campaign."
The campaign launch coincided with the ongoing 'Rendezvous' festival at IIT Delhi, in which this year's theme is 'SHE', a social awareness drive.
UN Women is partnering with MenEngage, an acclaimed international forum that mobilises men and boys from around the world, to advocate for gender equality.
MenEngage will be hosting the 2nd Men Engage Global Symposium 'Men and Boys for Gender Justice' which will take place between November 10 and 13.
Abhijit Da from Centre for Health and Social Justice (CHSJ) shared that, "masculinity is a burden on men and boys. We need to break this mindset and this is the aim of the MenEngage."
"A UN Women booth is designed to get students to pledge their support for gender justice by signing up to the campaign. The HeForShe Campaign is a solidarity movement for gender equality developed by UN Women to engage men and boys as advocates and agents of change for the achievement of gender equality and women's rights," said Tavares.
The campaign was officially launched on the September 20 at the UN General Assembly. Since then 100,000 men have pledge support with 4000 in India.
UN Resident Coordinator, Lise Grande said, "We hope that men and boys raise their voices against inequality and commit themselves to equal partnerships. This is how progress will be made."

Be smart: Here are 4 things powerful people never do4 Things Powerful People Never Do
By Emmie Martin | Business Insider –  Thu 11 Sep, 2014 8:57 PM IST
Adam Nurkiewicz/Getty Images
Power is just as much about the actions you take as those you don't.
You'll notice that the most powerful people share several habits that contribute to their success. For instance, they constantly challenge themselves and commit to a strong work ethic.
There are also a few things they never do — which  can be just as important to their long-term success.
Here are four of the most important things that powerful people never do:
Blame others.
When things go wrong, powerful people take responsibility for their mistakes and look for solutions instead of trying to place blame elsewhere. By being open about failure, they inspire and elevate others, rather than isolate them, explains Chris Deaver, a HR business partner at Disney, in a recent LinkedIn post . "They're the first to dive in to change things for good, and the last to take credit for it," he says. Shifting the blame won't earn you any respect.
Hide behind a screen.
Powerful people recognize the importance of face-to-face relationships and put in-person interactions ahead of anything that might be happening on their phone or computer screen. "In conversations, they stay engaged and authentic with everyone, knowing that their greatest influence is to be found in listening, sharing, and joining forces to innovate together," Deaver says. Technology might make you feel powerful at times, but real relationships matter most in the end.
Work alone.
Gaining influence isn't a solo effort, so the most powerful people know to welcome feedback, Deaver says. Creating partnerships, embracing criticism, and maintaining genuine honesty will help you climb to the top without knocking others down. Powerful people give their opinions, but also remain open to what others have to say. "They know it's better to get to the top of the mountain and see fellow friends they've helped to become powerful rather than a bunch of people they've forced down on their way to success," Deaver says.
Go with the flow.
Imitation might be the highest form of flattery, but it won't give you an edge. Rather, powerful people constantly look for ways to challenge the status quo. "They innovate life in ways that create a strong demand for their approach and brand," Deaver says. They stick to their ideas, but find ways to accomplish them in new and fearless ways.

Indian job market shows signs of improvementPrint
>
New Delhi, Sep 16 (IANS) The Indian companies job market is finally showing signs of improvement after almost two years as more than half of the companies surveyed in India are hiring now, a latest survey done by search and selection specialist Antal International Tuesday said.
"The survey stated that 52 percent of Indian companies are recruiting new staff at the moment, while 60 percent are looking to do so in the near future," the 16th Antal Global Snapshot said.
"It does seem the 'achhe din' are around the corner," Joseph Devasia, managing director, Antal International Network India said here.
Sectors like e-commerce, real estate, consumer goods have reported the highest percentage of current hiring as nearly all of those questioned reported they were currently taking on staff in these sectors. Demand in these areas is expected to increase in the next quarter, the survey stated.
"Compared to our last hiring survey and what is being seen, there has been an upsurge is hiring activity at the managerial levels. Consumer-led sectors like e-commerce, FMCG, durables and related industries are buoyant. Some near sectors like logistics and packaging that support e-commerce are also seeing a huge spurt in growth. This does mean, talent shortage will be the big discussion point in board rooms," Devasia added.
Other sectors that are faring well in terms of current hiring include healthcare, chemical, IT - software and packaging. retail, which is currently hiring at 48 percent is expected to go up to 75 percent in the next quarter.
Similarly, chemicals sector which is currently hiring at 58 percent is expected to boost hiring at managerial level in the next three months (71 percent).
The manufacturing sector, which is facing a tough time at the moment also showed signs of improvement with 56 percent companies likely to hire. Faster economic growth, investor-friendly and a more focused government are seen as the reasons behind this positive outcome, the report added.

Obama to seek more funds to fight Ebola: ReportPresident Barack Obama is preparing to ask Congress for additional funding to fight the Ebola virus, Bloomberg reported, citing White House and congressional officials.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama is preparing to ask Congress for additional funding to fight the Ebola virus, Bloomberg reported on Saturday, citing White House and congressional officials.
Obama could make the request as early as next week, the congressional official told Bloomberg. Both officials declined to say how much additional funding Obama would seek, the report said.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Friday that Obama had not made any decisions about whether additional resources were necessary.
The U.S. government now has more than $1 billion available to fight the spread of Ebola from three West African countries, where it has killed more than 4,500 people.
Obama, who has been criticized by Republicans for the administration's handling of Ebola, urged Americans on Saturday not to give in to "hysteria" about the spread of the virus.
Three people have been diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and more than 100 are being monitored for possible signs of the disease. One of those diagnosed, a Liberian man who traveled to Dallas, Texas from his home country in late September, died last week.

Innovated in India  shoes: Now you never ge...(The idea of including the differently-abled into…)
By: Jyoti Pande Lavakare
First came the sleek, fashionable, inclusive and wearable technology with a cause:
Lechal, the innovative, bluetooth-enabled haptic shoe (haptic technology recreates the sense of touch via vibrations).
Then came even greater innovation: in thinking through and deciding upon the actual process of manufacturing that tech-embedded shoe — right here in India — using differently-abled people. When both product and process innovation become so integrated in the overall philosophy of the company that you can't separate one from the other — it's about inclusion as much as about profit — it truly becomes the coolest thing.
But let's begin from the beginning. At an elementary level, Lechal shoes appear to intersect the worlds of sci-fi and magic — with a bit of James Bond thrown in. If you wear these shoes, you can never get lost — even if you're blind.
And while they're doing their job liberating you from ever having to read a map, look at a screen or ask for directions, they're also telling you the distance to your destination, the number of steps you've walked, biked or run, calories you've burnt, fitness levels and other metrics.
Additionally, they can track activities, set customised fitness targets, workout sessions and milestones and motivate you via audio or screen, transferring all this data seamlessly to your smartphone. And because they're on your feet, they're more accurate than other wearable technology that offers similar information.
Lechal came into being for a noble cause — to help the visually challenged navigate with Google maps through the use of haptics and digital mapping. And although it has since become more inclusive — to include those who are not visually challenged — Lechal's original intention remains priority.
Lechal (a rough translation from Hindi would be "take me along") signals the wearer through vibrations, the intensity and duration of which vary to correlate with the distance to an upcoming turn. So, it will vibrate longer the closer you are to your turn. The intensity can be pre-set to custom requirements. It also syncs up with smartphones through an app to provide a variety of other navigational metrics and fitness information.
Innovated in India
Here's how it works: the insoles are embedded with removable sensors powered by two rechargeable lithium polymer batteries which sync with mobile apps like Google maps. Directions are relayed through haptic feedback through vibrations either in the left or the right shoe.
  Now let's get to the innovative thought in the manufacturing process. When Lechal pre-orders opened in February, its founding team of Krispian Lawrence and Anirudh Sharma was still focused mainly on fine-tuning their innovative product and hadn't got around to thinking through the manufacturing process.
At that time, they had 12 different manufacturers and suppliers in China who were manufacturing and assembling the shoe according to their specifications.
"Our initial product only said 'innovated in India'," Lawrence said in a phone interview from Secunderabad, where he has just leased a factory to locate his manufacturing unit. That itself is laudable, as India and China are usually seen as backend sweatshops rather than centres of innovation.
But it was only after they'd tinkered around, fine-tuned and refined the final version of their product that they turned their attention to the manufacturing process.
By this time, they already had 40,000 online pre-orders — which translate into immediate revenues of roughly $6 million at a price point of $150 per pair. For the two co-founders, who set up Ducere Technologies, built the prototype in 2011 and raised $2 million as seed capital, the innovation had just begun.
Last month, they concluded negotiations to lease a turnkey factory for the start-up to begin its own manufacturing right here in India, a timely alignment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make In India' exhortation.
"It (the factory) is around 25 km from Secunderabad," says Lawrence, and they will soon begin the process of modifying it with wheelchair access and other disability aids so that they can hire as many differently-abled people as possible.
Lawrence and Sharma's business plan plays to the strengths of the differently-abled on a large scale — on the assembly line, on the factory floor and in quality control.
There's a sound rationale to these hirings: after all, who can do a repetitive job requiring high focus and precision better than someone on the autism spectrum; and which person's touch would be more sensitive in testing for quality than one who cannot see?
Add to this the social and financial benefits of including a previously non-productive demographic into the workforce along with the dignity of earning their own living, and the decision becomes priceless.

Rummy for stakes a card game or a criminal offence: SC to decide(Perhaps the most anxious…)
By: Sajai Singh & Yajas Setlur
Nearly 50 years after its landmark decision in the State of Andhra Pradesh vs Sathyanarayana Case, the Supreme Court is again faced with a dilemma regarding the card game of rummy in India. The Supreme Court has begun to hear an appeal by the Mahalakshmi Cultural Association (MCA), against which the Madras High Court made an adverse ruling in 2012.
The High Court held that playing rummy for stakes or any sort of wager would be a criminal offence under the Madras Police Act, 1888 ('Act'), the provisions of which are connected with most other state gaming laws in India.
In the Sathyanarayana case, the Supreme Court ruled that rummy involved a substantial amount of skill and therefore could not be termed gambling. In its concluding paragraphs, however, the court observed that if the game was played for stakes, the offence of gambling would be established. It was on the basis of this observation that the Madras High Court ruled against the MCA.
The concept of 'game of skill' is the determining factor in almost all gaming and gambling statutes in India, including the Madras Police Act, 1888. Section 49 of the Act exempts penal provisions against 'games of mere skill'.
The appellants and a host of online rummy companies are hoping to use this exemption, coupled with the aforementioned findings in the Sathyanarayana case, to convince the Supreme Court, that rummy, with or without stakes, should be exempt from gaming statutes and be deemed legal. The appellants contend that if a game is based on skills when played without stakes, such nature cannot change merely because money is wagered.
A Grey Area
The respondent, the state of Tamil Nadu, however, relies on the definition of 'Gaming' under the Act, which includes betting or wagering of any kind, and therefore contends that despite the exemption under Section 49 of the Act, betting or wagering on a game, even on one of skill, is indeed 'gaming' and therefore illegal (the terms 'Gaming' and 'Gambling' have been used interchangeably in this column).
This case is the culmination of years of contradicting High Court opinions on the subject and is awaited by state governments and stakeholders in the multibillion-dollar Indian gambling industry as it could potentially seal the fate of gambling in India. A decision of the court in favour of the appellants would open the floodgates to not only traditional brick-and mortar gaming establishments, but also to rummy websites, which have so far had an ambiguous legal existence.
Indeed, it would vindicate several of the appellants who are already offering online rummy for a fee. Such a judgement would also vindicate the judgements of the Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh High Courts, which have permitted skillbased card games with stakes. A positive verdict will set off other far-reaching events. More stakeholders will be encouraged to contend that similar skill-based card games such as poker should also be allowed to be played for stakes. The legality of poker in India has been a hotly debated matter in recent times.
The Karnataka High Court in 2013 unambiguously recognised poker as a game of skill, but several other high courts have (indirectly, while referring to the 'three card game') found poker to be a game of pure chance and hence, illegal. An appeal filed by Gaussian Networks is pending before the Delhi High Court on this exact point, and a judgement by the Supreme Court on rummy is bound to influence the high court's verdict.
  Even more crucially, such a judgement may pave the way for legalised betting on sports in India such as cricket and football, which are indisputable games of skill. So far, in what many believe to be an arbitrary distinction, betting has been legalised only on horse races among sports. The flip side is that allowing wagering in rummy may indirectly allow betting on the outcome of a sporting event.
The FDI Card
Perhaps, the most interested and anxious observers of this case are foreign gaming companies that have been trying for years to enter the lucrative Indian market.
A favourable decision (rummy is not gambling) will mean that the prevailing FDI policy, which prohibits all forms of investment in the gambling and lottery sectors, will not apply to rummy operations. That will be an impetus to the growth and influence of several offshore online betting companies such as bet365 in India — these companies already have millions of loyal Indian customers.
Even if the judgement were to favour the gaming industry, it may still not be a cakewalk — states are likely to amend gaming statutes in response. Odisha and Assam, for example, already have gaming laws that criminalise wagering on games of skill and chance alike. It is likely that other states will follow suit and plug the loophole of 'skill' in their gambling regulations.
Just as a decision in favour of the appellants will be an undoubted boost for gaming, a decision against them would spell its doom in India. The respondents have urged the court to consider the matter in a holistic manner, taking into account that 'gambling dens', including those operated by the MCA, often offer intoxicants to their members and plunge them into gambling addictions and deep and unsupportable debt.
It remains to be seen whether the court will decide this crucial case from a strictly legal perspective, based on the skill/chance component of rummy and the effect of adding stakes thereto, or on the social and economic repercussions of wagering. Either way, the judgement will have a considerable influence on the future of all forms of gambling in India.

Jean Tirole: Why the Nobel prize winner s research is important for IndiaJean Tirole: Why the Economics Nobel prize winner's research is important for India

The works of the Nobel Memorial Prize winner in economic sciences are relevant to economies grappling with regulation and crony capitalism.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Prerna Katiyar
And this year's Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel goes to Jean Tirole for his work on market power and regulation...'
It's an award from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to a person with a French name with Hebrew origin for his work that many would tend to presuppose is Greek. The presumption that the Nobel memorial prize for economic sciences tends to be awarded for esoteric research isn't misplaced.
After all, winners in the past have taken home the award for works like 'intertemporal tradeoffs in macroeconomic policy' (2006) or 'analyzing economic time series with timevarying volatility' (2003), which don't quite qualify as accessible or perspicuous.
Against that backdrop, Jean Tirole of Toulouse University in France being awarded for his research on regulating large firms that display monopolistic tendencies is immensely more palatable, even for those without an economics major. Here is someone who has won the award for research on a subject that in essence protects consumers.
For policymakers all over the world, the French researcher's work is significant. Indeed, for Indian public policy, this year's award is relevant like it has not been for many years. "The nature of scams that have come to the fore recently in India is a reflection of the lack of a regulatory framework.
Tirole's work shows that not only is regulation vital for the growth of healthy capitalism and an entrepreneurial society but is also needed for curtailing crony capitalism," says Anil K Gupta, a professor at IIM Ahmedabad.
Although 'theoretical', Tirole's work has far-reaching implications in our everyday lives. Over the past three decades, he has carried out seminal work on regulations to handle monopolies and more importantly 'oligopolies', sectors which are dominated by a 'few powerful firms'.
His work delves deep into answering some fundamental questions faced by every government. How should governments deal with mergers or cartels, and how should they regulate key sectors dominated by a handful of firms.
Innovation vs Distortion
He showed that the conventional wisdom of capping prices in monopolies and regulating oligopolies works well only in certain conditions, but in others it can be counter-productive. "Price caps can provide dominant firms with strong motives to reduce costs — a good thing for society — but may also permit excessive profits — a bad thing for society... The merger of a firm and its supplier may encourage innovation , but may also distort competition," is how the Academy explains his work.
India has come a long way since 1991— when the licence raj was the norm and private capital was restricted. Gradually, as the economy was opened up for private ventures, a number of independent regulators were set up by the government.
Now, most of the sectors — banking, the securities market and exchanges, telecom, insurance, electricity, petroleum and natural gas — are being supervised by these regulators. There are others in the pipeline, such as a Civil Aviation Authority .

From Kinari Bazaar and Dariba Kalan, to Bhagirath Palace and Khari Baoli, the hectic shopping spree at the different markets of Chandni Chowk starts more than a fortnight before Diwali

Save precious time tracking your investments
It's Diwali season and time again for frenzied shoppers — not just from the capital, but from National Capital Region (NCR) and even neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana — to flock to Chandni Chowk, Delhi's Mughal era heritage bazaar that is touted as one of Asia's largest wholesale markets.
From Kinari Bazaar for blingy embellishments and Dariba Kalan for jewellery to suit all pockets, to Bhagirath Palace for fairy lights and Khari Baoli for dry fruit, the hectic shopping spree at the different markets of Chandni Chowk starts more than a fortnight before Diwali and extends right up to the year-end wedding season.
"Traditionally, it has been business worth thousands of crores of rupees a day during the Diwali season," says Pawan Kumar, a Chandni Chowk trader and president of the Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association. "But this year we are facing a big problem of import shipments [of Diwali goods] from China being delayed due to red tape. They are very slow in reaching us here in Delhi," adds Kumar, who is a big importer from China.
The renovation and redevelopment work in Chandni Chowk, under the aegis of the urban development ministry, is the other obvious problem. "Recently, the arterial road has been dug up and people find it very difficult to come here with their vehicles," laments Sushant Jain , whose family owns Ghantewala Confectioners, a traditional mithai shop that dates back to 1790.
ggest that consumers — hunting for everything from traditional mithai to Chinese lights — have given up on Chandni Chowk. Bhagirath Palace, for instance, a half-a-kilometre stretch with over 2,500 registered shops selling only lights and lighting equipment, is packed. "Chinese LEDs are the hottest selling items this year," says Rajesh Rana , who owns three shops in the area. For his part, Rana uses the opportunity to draw a rather politically incorrect parallel between the Chinese lights and the three Japanese scientists who won the Nobel Prize in physics for LED technology.
About a kilometre away, at the fireworks and crackers market behind the iconic Jama Masjid, Chinese goods are not popular. Almost all the 50 shops in the area carry signage boycotting Chinese fireworks; here all supplies come from Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu.
Business at Khari Baoli, the traditional spices market near the famous Fatehpuri Masjid, is slowly picking up and Akshay Kumar , who owns a wholesale and retail outlet here, hopes that in the last few days before Diwali, there will be more people visiting the market to buy gift baskets for friends and family. He is worried that the high prices may deter buyers. They don't seem to be.

Suicide drama at New York's Times Square
New York City police persuaded a man perched on the ledge of a building near Times Square to step back, after his threat to jump led to traffic being closed for nearly two hours on Thursday afternoon, officials said.
The man, who was not identified, had sat down at the edge of the building overlooking the Madame Tussauds wax museum and other popular establishments, on 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues, a spokesman with the New York City Police Department said. The structure houses businesses that include a hotel and restaurant. The man, who was in his 30s, was taken into custody unharmed and transported to a hospital for psychological evaluation, police said. He is not currently facing charges. Calls began to roll in at 2:45 p.m. about a person sitting on the ledge of a terrace outside a middle floor of the 11-story building near Times Square, one of the biggest tourist attractions in the city. The roadway and sidewalks outside, normally buzzing with vehicles and pedestrians, were closed to traffic shortly afterwards, police said. While the man was on the ledge, about a half-dozen emergency vehicles were parked on the street below and a giant safety cushion was inflated on the ground directly underneath him. About a dozen police, including hostage negotiators, could be seen standing near him as he sat at the edge of the building, slouched with his hands crossed in front of him.(Reuters)

Here s how Jayalalithaa spent her days in jailPrint
Bangalore: Former Tamil Nadu chief minister J. Jayalalithaa, who was granted bail Friday, spent about three weeks in jail getting up early in the morning and reading newspapers, taking rest in the afternoon after a lunch of curd rice, a stroll in the evening and hitting the bed early.
"Jayalalithaa is fine and her health is stable. Due to her ailments like diabetes and backache, doctors are present in the jail round-the-clock to attend her in case of emergency," Karnataka Deputy Inspector General (prisons) P.M. Jaisimha told IANS before the Supreme Court granted bail to her.
Jayalalithaa was lodged in Bangalore jail after her conviction in a disproportionate assets case. The former chief minister was awarded four-year prison term and a fine of Rs.100 crore.
An apex court bench headed by Chief Justice H.L. Dattu said that Jayalalithaa and three others will be released on bail subject to the satisfaction of the condition by the trial court.
The senior official said that no special privileges were extended to Jayalalithaa and she was in the jail like other convicts in compliance with the court warrant and the prison manual.
"Considering her age limitations and basic requirements, Jayalalithaa is lodged in a separate room, which has a cot, a mattress, a ceiling fan, a small table and chair," Jaisimha said told IANS.
On her physician's advise, Jayalalithaa used to have a simple breakfast, one or two chapathis and curd rice for lunch and just curd rice for supper.
"Jayalalithaa has a strong mind and extraordinary knowledge. She converses with jail staff in Kannada and is very fluent in English. She also speaks in Telugu and Malayalam," Jaisimha said.
Waking up daily between 5.45 a.m. and 6 a.m., Jayalalithaa spent her morning hours reading a couple of English and Tamil newspapers till noon and rested post lunch. She remained confined to the room and stepped out to stroll for a while in the evening and went to sleep early in the night.
"She used to go for morning walk earlier (first week) on the lawn facing the room, but discontinued later and remains confined to the room, engaged in reading or writing for a while. She is disciplined and abides by the prison rules. She has not made any demand in terms of facilities or requirements either to the court or the jail warden," Jaisimha said.
Though the jail has 90-minute (10 a.m. to 11.30 a.m.) slot for visitors or relatives daily except Sunday, Jayalalithaa did not met anyone from outside since a fortnight.
"She has declined to meet any visitor though several people, including ministers, lawmakers and officials from Tamil Nadu, came to the jail with security pass but returned without meeting her since Oct 1," Jaisimha said.
Even within the jail, Jayalalithaa used to meet only her three associates - Sasikala Natarajan, V. Sudhakaran and J. Elavarisi, who were also convicted and sentenced to four years imprisonment in the same case but with a fine of Rs.10 crore each.
"The brief interaction is mostly evenings though not daily when they visit her with permission in the room or outside when she steps out for a stroll in the lawn," Jaisimha said.

Tendulkar and Dravids 15-year-old record brokenTweet

Dolphins 367 for 0 (Van Wyk 175*, Delport 169*) beat Knights 342 for 7 (Hendricks 181, Second 107, Engelbrecht 3-46, Frylinck 3-62) by 25 runs
Morne van Wyk and Cameron Delport shattered a 15-year old record with a 367-run opening partnership to lead Dolphins to victory over Knights.
The stand was the highest for any wicket in List A cricket, and beat the previous mark of 331 set by Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid for India against New Zealand in Hyderabad in 1999.
Van Wyk made an unbeaten 175 off 171 deliveries while Delport scored an unbeaten 169 off 130. Van Wyk hit 15 fours and five sixes while Delport cracked 12 fours and six sixes.

Knights responded with a 275-run stand for the second wicket between Reeza Hendricks and Rudi Second. Hendricks surged to 181 off 135 with 16 fours and three sixes while Second made 107 off 124.
Knights were 289 for 1 in the 44th over, needing another 79 off 40 when Second was dismissed by Robbie Frylinck. Three balls later, Frylinck removed Hendricks, and also sent back Dillon du Preez in his next over.
Knights' chase lost steam after that and they ended on 342 for 7 as Rabian Engelbrecht also finished with three wickets. The 23 extras, including 12 wides, that Knights conceded also cost them, as Dolphins gave away only five.
Cape Cobras 278 for 7 (Puttick 101, Levi 75) beat Warriors 206 (Ingram 101, Peterson 5-25) by 72 runs
Andrew Puttick and Richard Levi didn't break records but their 140-run opening partnership set up a 72-run win for Cape Cobras over Warriors. Cobras posted 278 for 7 and Robin Peterson 's 5 for 25 meant Warriors crumbled for 206 in the chase. Puttick made 101 off 125 while Levi scored 75 off 93. There weren't any major contributions after that, but that didn't prevent Cobras from setting a challenging target, despite Andrew Birch taking 3 for 48.
Colin Ingram led the chase with 101 off 104 but the next-highest score for Warriors was Michael Price's 32. Peterson ripped through the top and middle orders, taking four of the first five wickets and finishing off with the scalp of Ingram, who was the ninth man out. It was Peterson's fifth five-wicket haul in 209 List A matches.
Lions 260 for 8 (Petersen 76, Cook 55, de Lange 4-57) beat Titans 222 (Wiese 77, Tsotsobe 3-29) by 38 runs
Lions weren't to be left behind on a day of big opening partnerships, as Stephen Cook and Alviro Petersen 's 106-run association helped the side to a 38-run win over Titans. Cook scored 55 and Petersen made 76 after which Neil McKenzie (36) and Jean Symes (41) pushed Lions past 250. Marchant de Lange struck thrice at the death to end with 4 for 57.
Lonwabo Tsotsobe took out the Titans openers cheaply, and the chase never took off after that. Tsotsobe picked up 3 for 29 with two maidens in his nine overs as Titans were bowled out in the 46th over. Tsotsobe is the leading wicket-taker in the tournament so far with nine victims from three games at an average of 8.22 and an economy-rate of 3.70.
Eddie Leie also chipped in with three wickets while Kagiso Rabada and Dwaine Pretorius claimed two each. David Wiese fought with 77 but he had little support.

Maharashtra  Haryana poll results today; BJP upbeatMaharashtra, Haryana poll results today; BJP upbeat
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 19, 2014
First Published: 00:37 IST(19/10/2014) | Last Updated: 07:47 IST(19/10/2014)
Comments
The Haryana and Maharashtra poll results to be announced Sunday will not only have a bearing on how the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) picks its poll partners but will also decide the pace at which reforms planned by the Modi government will move.
 
The fact that the government did not wait for results before freeing up diesel and fixing gas price Saturday showed a sense of urgency. Coming days are expected to see a bigger push for reforms.
Exit polls have given the BJP the edge in both Maharashtra and Haryana, with some even predicting an outright win for the party.
HT Explains: What's at stake for the parties
Haryana ruled by the Congress for 10 years recorded highest-ever turnout of 76.54%, while Maharashtra, where the Congress and NCP formed the ruling coalition, recorded 63.13% polling.
If exit polls hold true Sunday, it will deliver yet another blow to the Congress. The two states are not only crucial politically but also in terms of resource generation.
The Congress seemed resigned to its fate. Many senior spokespersons and panelists Saturday stayed away from a meeting called at the party’s war room to plan response to the outcome and leaders to be fielded on TV channels.
As for the BJP, going solo could be the new mantra if it were to come to power in the two states — which will be a first.
Laying bare reservations about playing second fiddle to regional partners, the BJP walked out of 25-year-old alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and ended its brief partnership with the Haryana Janhit Congress of Kuldeep Bishnoi.
A victory will allow the party to be more firm with existing and prospective allies, with some big state elections to follow.
Bihar is due for election next year. West Bengal, where the BJP has managed to make some inroads and even win its first assembly seat in 15 years, goes to the polls in 2016 with Assam and Tamil Nadu.
The BJP will fight some of these elections -- like the one in Bihar– with allies, while for others it will join hand with regional parties like in Jharkhand.  A god showing in Maharashtra and Haryana will give the party greater leverage when negotiating seat-share with allies.
In both the states, the BJP, in a break from practice, did not project a CM-face and instead showed confidence in the “Modi wave” to ride to power. A favourable outcome, party leaders say, would be an endorsement of the economic policies of the Modi government, which has tried to achieve higher growth without ignoring the concerns of the aam aadmi.
To fuel growth, the government plans to take more steps and a win in the two crucial states would be an added bonus.

Despite low inflation  why economy is not out of woodsYou are here: Home > Collections
Inflation is down & crude prices have fallen sharply, but the economy is not out of woods. Why?
Avinash Celestine, ET Bureau Oct 19, 2014, 10.06AM IST
Tags:
Consumer Price Inflation
(Nitsure points out there…)
With both retail and wholesale prices dropping sharply in the recent months, anticipation is higher than ever of that long-awaited event — a cut in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
Consumer price inflation is currently at about 6.5%, seemingly within the comfort zone for the RBI's target of getting prices down to 8% by January. Many analysts, though, see little hope of a rate cut at any point in the next few months at least.
"The RBI has been fighting a fiveyear battle with inflation," says Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist with the Bank of Baroda. "That battle is not going to end that easily."
To be sure, as Nitsure points out, there are good reasons to believe that the decline in inflation in the past couple of months may be purely an artefact of the numbers.
Inflation between September and November last year rose by over two percentage points to close to 12%. Because of this high 'base effect', as statisticians call it, part of the drop in recent months was only to be expected.
"The inflation rate for November will see the lowest number in five years," says Nitsure. "But expect inflation to rise after that."
The RBI is likely to wait and watch for a few months on whether inflation is coming down and will stay low before finally taking a call on interest rates.
India Impact
But there are other concerns as well. The global economy is weak, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its latest global growth forecasts. The notable exception here is the US, which has seen improved growth in recent months with the US unemployment rate falling to 6.1% in August, a level not seen since 2008.
This would normally be seen as a good thing, but markets also take it as a sign that growth increases the risk of inflation rising well above what the US central bank would see as comfortable, forcing it to raise interest rates. "In fact, that's a key risk right now," says economist Abheek Barua, currently with think tank ICRIER.
Analysts see a possible rate hike by the Federal Reserve by the second or third quarter of 2015.
But why should that matter to the Indian economy? A hike in US interest rates, or even the mere expectation among investors, has led to outflows of foreign investor money from emerging markets back to the US. This has happened with little regard to the state of individual markets at that time.
 
"India may do a bit better relative to other Asian markets, but we are still quite vulnerable," says Barua. Even the other big positive for the Indian economy in recent months — the sharp fall in crude oil prices — takes on a more ominous tone when seen in this light.
The decline in prices of crude and other commodities may be just the first signs of this 'capital flight' back to the US, though other factors such as the weakness in key economies of Europe and China have certainly played a role. "The question could well be as to which market is next," says Barua.
Even weak global commodity prices in themselves have an ambiguous effect on the Indian economy. It's good for consumers, but not so good for farmers who can expect relatively meagre earnings across a range of key crops as global prices remain soft. That hurts the earnings of around half the workforce who earn a living from agriculture, and therefore the rural economy.
Structural Issues
An outflow of portfolio capital from the Indian markets would inevitably be seen as having a negative impact on the rupee. Indeed, in real terms, when the differences in inflation rates between India and the rest of the world are taken into account, the rupee is seen as 'overvalued' against key currencies and ripe for a fall. If this does happen, the sharp fall in the price at which India buys crude oil (currently at around $87 per barrel) would be offset partly by a weaker exchange rate.
These 'macro' risks are quite apart from the broader structural issues with the Indian economy, which the new government has only begun to address. As Nitsure points out, apart from industrial growth, bank credit too remains very weak. "Though the government has been active in clearing stalled projects, corporates are still in a wait-and-watch mode," she says. The fall in inflation is a good sign, but the economy is hardly in the clear.

The big challenges to India s ambitious Jan Dhan YojanaWhose Dhan is it anyway?
By E. Kumar Sharma | India Today Group –  Sat 6 Sep, 2014 5:09 PM IST
Print
Manjula Magan Goswami, 50, a resident of Dharavi, one of Asias largest slums, has just opened a bank account for the first time in her life. Goswami, a cook, is still not sure why she needs an account and what the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana can do for her.
"Everybody told me to open this account and I did it. It was not difficult. People tell me I can save money in this account," she says, not quite aware that the State Bank of India (SBI) account she has opened comes with benefits like an insurance cover and a debit card facility.
Goswami is not alone in figuring out this newly thrust financial freedom on the poor. Since the launch of the scheme by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 28, SBI has opened more than 20 lakh accounts. Nationally, across banks, a total of more than two crore new accounts were opened within two days of the scheme's launch.
Even before 2006 when the term financial inclusion started figuring in the lexicon of bankers, opening accounts for the financially excluded was not new to banks. But now financial inclusion has acquired a new urgency with the Modi touch. Bankers are not sparing any effort to open accounts. What also stands out this time is the design of the product that is being positioned as a win-win for all.
However, at the moment, it is the banks that are really bearing the brunt of the cost of this scheme, if one ignores the government spending on advertisement to boost its image. Consider this: Most banks have to spend a minimum of Rs 100-150 per account - think of movement of documents, commission/fee paid to business correspondents at remote locations, cost of RuPay card, setting up of camps across the country. All of this to acquire a deposit of Rs 95, say in the case of an SBI account, which collected Rs 19 crore in deposits from the 20 lakh accounts it opened.
The average deposit per account would be above Rs 400 if one goes by figures stated by finance ministry officials that more than Rs 1,000 crore was collected in deposits in 2.3 crore accounts even though bulk of these accounts would have zero deposits.
2 crore The number of accounts opened within two days of the scheme's launch.That is not all. There is the annual maintenance cost. Typically, it works out to around Rs 100 per account a year and this is so even if the accounts are not in operation. So, in a sense, many banks start with a loss. More importantly, low-deposit savings accounts cost a lot more to service.
Most banks in India require a minimum deposit of Rs 5,000 for a savings account. Some bankers in private concede that if this programme is to be viable then all direct transfers by the government would have to be routed through these accounts. What is more, there should be a minimum average balance of Rs 1,000 per account to enable banks to make a Rs 50 to Rs 60 profit per annum.
This is again without any transactions happening in the account. If theoretically four operations, as is expected under this programme, are made at an ATM in a bank, then each costs roughly Rs 10. This adds up to Rs 40 per month and a total of Rs 480 will be the cost of servicing these accounts every year.
Bankers are aware of these numbers, but the effort is to keep the momentum going. "We organised around 11,500 camps at various places across the country and opened three times the number of accounts we add normally in a day.
For the first time, here is a deposit product being attached to insurance and going forward having a pension scheme and small loans scheme attached to it," says B. Sriram, Managing Director, SBI.
He and many others see it as a win-win for all and with good reasons: banks get low-cost deposits, banks can also cross-sell other products and services, while insurance companies get access to new account holders.
But in all of these, time is the biggest constraint: Modi's goal of achieving this level of financial inclusion - some seven crore households - by January 26 next year is in, some sense, compressing a five-year exercise into less than six months.
Most banks have been pooling all their resources and manpower, and this is evident in the large number of new accounts going live nationally.
Take Andhra Bank, for instance. The lender straddles Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, regions that were once the hub of microfinance activity. Andhra Bank Chairman and Managing Director C.V.R. Rajendran said the bank set things in motion 48 hours before the launch of the programme.
"On August 26, we first had a video conference with all our 33 zonal managers and set a target to add 3,50,000 new accounts by August 28 and we followed this up by setting up over 2,000 account opening camps across the country and ended up opening over five lakh accounts." He says that opening of accounts under financial inclusion has been happening earlier too but the focus now, in a short time, is intense.
So, what does all this mean for the poor and financial intermediaries such as banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs)?
"Much depends on how banks take this forward. If they do not look at this as a one off-activity and use this as an opportunity to connect with the poor and eventually start offering loans, then the client base of the microfinance institutions could get impacted overtime and the microfinance institutions could see direct competition from banks," says Vijayalakshmi Das, a microfinance expert and CEO of Friends of Women's World Banking.
G. Padmaja Reddy, Founder and Managing Director of microfinance firm Spandana Sphoorty Financial, feels the banking infrastructure needs to gear up with better branch network before MFIs in remote locations use these accounts to disburse loans instead of handling cash as they do today.
Modi's goal of covering seven crore households by January is like compressing a five-year exercise into six months
"Banks need to have adequate manpower to service this sudden rise in number of account holders," she says.
A new account will hardly lead to financial inclusion if it becomes dormant. Even in case of the accident insurance that is being offered, officials at the National Payment Corporation of India told Business Today that at the time of the accident the account must be active for an account holder to make a claim.
In other words, there should be at least one transaction in 45 days prior to the accident. There is hope, however, that with every account holder getting a RuPay debit card with a Rs 1.3 lakh accident and life cover, there will be active users.
There is also talk of an overdraft facility for each account holder. As Andhra Bank's Rajendran points out, loans will be offered only after banks monitor the track record of the account holder over the next few months.
Plus, there is a promise from Modi that "as we go along, they will be covered by insurance and pension products". Here lies the opportunity for lakhs of new account holders like Goswami in Dharavi and elsewhere across the country to join the banking mainstream. Never mind if the financial community - bankers, insurers et al, along with the tax payers enjoying smooth services so far - sweats it out a bit more than usual.

How Ebolas affecting African players in EuropeAfrican players in Europe feel Ebola backlash

By Mark Gleeson
CAPE TOWN, (Reuters) - African footballers based at European clubs, especially those travelling back to the continent from international duty, began on Friday to feel the backlash from fears over the Ebola virus outbreak.
A Sierra Leone player has been asked to stay away from his Greek club after competing in African Nations Cup qualifiers while former French champions Montpellier ordered a player to have medical tests on his return from the continent.
Ivory Coast full back Siaka Tiene, who played in two matches against the Democratic Republic of Congo over the last week, was asked to undergo a medical examination on his return to Montpellier on Friday following trips to Kinshasa and Abidjan.
“For him to be examined seems to be a prudent and logical move,” the club’s coach Roland Courbis told Radio Monte Carlo.
John Kamara has been told by Greek second division club Lamia to stay away for the next three weeks after he returned from playing for Sierra Leone against Cameroon.
Sierra Leone is one of three West African nations at the epicentre of the worst outbreak of the disease on record which has killed more than 4,500 people but their matches were held in Cameroon, where there have been no reports of the haemorrhagic fever, because of a ban on Sierra Leone hosting internationals.
“It’s something crazy. The club told me I shouldn’t be with them for 15 to 21 days as I went to Africa to play and because of the Ebola virus,” the 26-year-old told the BBC on Friday.
“They made it clear I should stay indoors and not go to training. I’ve told the club I’m ready to undergo any medical they want me to do – as far as I’m concerned I don’t have the Ebola virus. I don’t understand it but I have to respect their decision,” he added.
The incubation period for the Ebola virus from the time of infection to symptoms is two to 21 days, the World Heath Organisation said on its website.    Sierra Leone’s footballers were confined to their hotel in Cameroon and had their temperatures checked twice daily.
It was reported last week that Guinea international Lass Bangoura was asked by Rayo Vallecano not play in his country's Nations Cup qualifiers against Ghana but it turned out the Spanish-based player had not been called up for the matches.
Former Ghana international Michael Essien on Monday denied internet rumours he had contracted the virus.
“Ebola is a very serious issue and people shouldn’t joke about it,” he said on Instagram. “Whoever wrote this article is very unprofessional and insensitive.”
Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew said his club were working on putting plans in place for the return of African footballers from internationals.
“Our doctor has looked into the options that might arise and also protective for them. It’s something to be concerned about. We all have to be on our guard,” he said.

Melbourne, Oct 18 (ANI): President Barack Obama has revealed that his credit card had been declined at a New York restaurant.

The bill had to be paid by the First Lady, Michelle Obama, and the President added that the restaurant staff believed that there had been some fraud.
As 100 million people had faced breaches last year, Mr. Obama has introduced a new data protection plan, in which all government-issued credit cards shall have an internal chip that would replace the old magnetic strips to reduce the potential for fraud and protect from identity theft. (ANI)

Govt overestimated Air India s capability: P...Air India
(ET Magazine contacted former…)
ET Magazine contacted former aviation minister Praful Patel to respond to the issues raised in Bhargava's article. He refused to respond to the article per se but defended the aircraft acquisition and the processes followed by the aviation ministry while pushing the deal. Excerpts:
There was no wrongdoing. It was a collective decision of the government.
I accept that we overestimated the capability of Air India to carry out the aircraft acquisition plan.
The government provided sovereign guarantee for the acquisition.
The EGoM cleared the acquisition, which was finalized by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.
All processes, including informing the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and Chief Vigilance Commissioner with the entire set of documents, were adhered to while clearing the acquisition.
In 2012, when I ceased to be aviation minister, the government did not revoke the deal. It actually decided to purchase 20 of the 27 Dreamliners from Boeing. It could have cancelled the order because of the delays in delivery of the planes. Air India need not have paid fines for pulling out of the deal; rather, the airline could have imposed fines on Boeing for the delays.
Air India's old planes have been phased out while new ones have joined the fleet. Now, nearly 10 years after the order, 15 of the total 68 planes ordered have still not joined the fleet. So, the net addition of planes remains zero. In other words, the Air India fleet size today remains the same as it was in 2005.
I haven't stopped anyone from probing the deal. Let anyone bring out the facts or proof that the acquisition was mala fide.

Andyz Fish & Chips
(Around $60 billion is spent…)
On a Thursday evening, as the peak-hour traffic begins to build in east Bangalore, a group of 20-something friends enter a three-storey commercial complex on the periphery of Indiranagar, a posh residential suburb.
The ground floor of this building houses a popular vegetarian restaurant, frequented by large families. This group, though, has no interest in a leisurely meal. Instead, they are headed three floors up to Andyz Fish & Chips, one of a dozen new poker rooms that have mushroomed across India's IT Capital.
Riding on a Karnataka High Court judgment a year ago that declare d poker as a predominant game of skill and not one of chance, these entrepreneurs have set up these rooms across the length and breadth of the city, attracting dozens of youth who have familiarized themselves with the game online.
A few months later, it was the turn of a court to give rummy a stamp of legality — in a judgment, the Karnataka High Court quashed charges against 19 persons who were arrested on charges of gambling for playing rummy. Like in the case of poker, the court reckoned that rummy too was a game of skill, not chance.
Fish & Chips
There's no board to direct you to Andyz, which sounds more like a restaurant but for those who play the game, both 'fish' and 'chips' are poker-speak — the former for a novice and the latter are the tokens that masquerade as money.
As the rest of the city makes its way home at around 7.30 pm, two tables are well into their games of poker. Andyz has half a dozen tables (including one for VIP members with cushioned leather chairs in a room) and, on weekends, you can expect at least five of them to be busy. "Everyone who comes here has tried online poker first, but now wants a taste of the real thing," says Andy Morgan, co - founder of the club. "We have 300 members and we're adding to this list daily."
Over the past couple of years, India's legal system — state by state — has been opening up to the possibilities of more legitimate avenues for gambling. For example, in September this year, the Supreme Court sought the Union government's thoughts on viewing online rummy as a game of skill — and therefore a more legal operation — rather than a decidedly illegal game of chance.
Elsewhere, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh ruled that poker for stakes was a game of skill and therefore kosher. Sikkim runs an online and legal lottery system. Most visibly, lakhs of rupees are bet legally on horse races daily across India.
This interest is hardly a shock for regular punters, who have for decades been trying their hands at games of skill and chance. Every year, around Diwali, these games peak, as people flock to house parties for an assortment of card games, with money wagered between friends and family informally.
  Time to Take a Chance
If the popularity of poker clubs in Bangalore is any indication, then India may be ideally poised to benefit from a more broadly legalized gambling market, backed with stringent law enforcement (with the creation of gaming commissions as in the UK) and the opportunity to funnel crores of rupees from underground networks.
According to regulars, there is still a very limited opportunity in India to gamble legally for players who have honed their skills online and want to make a splash in the real world.
Some do try their hand at casinos in Goa and Sikkim, but many prefer to hit the gaming houses in Bangkok, Singapore (with just two large legally sanctioned casinos in Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa) or the Monte Carlo of the Orient — Macau.
The erstwhile Portuguese colony generated $45 billion in gambling revenues in 2013, barely a decade after making a concerted push into the market (although the Portuguese had legalized gambling way back in the 1850s).
Macau's meteoric rise has left old favourites in the US, Las Vegas and Atlantic City behind. As the legal tide turns, regular players hope that India can slowly unshackle itself from the past and emerge as an alternative destination for gambling.
The first signs of this movement are already visible — thanks to the internet, thousands of players between 18 and 40 years are well versed in games such as poker and rummy both online and offline — while legalization is prompting the establishment of new clubs.
"There's plenty of interest and excitement around these games and a stronger legal framework will only push more people to consider legal avenues," says Morgan of Andyz. The Karnataka High Court's ruling a year ago gave the gambling market a big fillip, prompting the setting up of a raft of new clubs. "This is an entirely legal operation," says KN Suresh, about the Indian Poker Association (IPA), of which he is the secretary and co-founder.

Jaydev Mody: Gambler-turned-entrepreneur & promoter of Delta Corp bets on casinosDelta Corp, the company focused on casinos in Goa and promoted by Jaydev Mody, has built The Deltin in Daman.

Save precious time tracking your investments
The courtyard at The Deltin in the coastal union territory of Daman tries to recreate the feel of a beachside resort. The long and curved pool with a bar at one end and sunbeds on the edge that allow guests to dip their torsos in water also has a beach-like slope to wade into.
Like on Indian beaches, sometimes guests do wade right in, wearing t-shirts, banyans or even long flowing nightgowns. For a five-star hotel, this isn't a pretty sight. So, a staff member gently requests a guest to don swimwear, only to face the materteral retort: "Do you expect us to wear bikinis?"
Daman, a former Portuguese colony, actually has its own swimwear for women, easily available in the markets near Devka beach. Inspired by the salwar kurta, the innovative swimwear works well with the conservative clientele in the swimming pools of Daman's hotels.
The beach town — often called a mini-Goa — has a church of Bom Jesus (Goa has the Basilica), and small Portuguesebuilt forts on either side of the Daman Ganga that flows through to the Arabian Sea. Devka is not much of a beach, largely rocky, with little sand — but has all the hotels around it.
The better beach, Jampore, has no hotels around, and offers cheap thrills such as horse and camel rides. The real attraction of Daman is the availability of cheap liquor — in the middle of Gujarat where it is prohibited.
Weekend evenings turn this heritage town into a quaint drinking joint preferred by the Gujarati folk and visitors from Mumbai.
Hard-drinking American comedian WC Fields once famously said: "I spent half my money on gambling, alcohol and wild women. The other half I wasted."
Tourists to Daman have enough of the grog and, although 'wild women' will remain a fantasy at best, they will soon get a chance to spend their money (perhaps even more than half ) on Fields' other not-so-trivial pursuit of gambling.
Daman, a mix of European heritage and Gujarati ethos, now awaits its first casino, which will be housed in The Deltin; the casino can be up and running within three months of getting a licence.
Delta Corp, the company focused on casinos in Goa and promoted by Jaydev Mody , has built The Deltin in Daman.
Set away from both the beaches, the hotel got its five-star certification a month and a half back and has now applied for a casino licence.
The Deltin, spread over 10 acres, is the only five-star hotel in the town, and the casino of course will be — an appropriate metaphor the only game in town.

Nobel winner Tirole s research important for...Jean Tirole: Why the Economics Nobel prize winner's research is important for India

The works of the Nobel Memorial Prize winner in economic sciences are relevant to economies grappling with regulation and crony capitalism.
ET SPECIAL:

Prerna Katiyar
And this year's Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel goes to Jean Tirole for his work on market power and regulation...'
It's an award from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to a person with a French name with Hebrew origin for his work that many would tend to presuppose is Greek. The presumption that the Nobel memorial prize for economic sciences tends to be awarded for esoteric research isn't misplaced.
After all, winners in the past have taken home the award for works like 'intertemporal tradeoffs in macroeconomic policy' (2006) or 'analyzing economic time series with timevarying volatility' (2003), which don't quite qualify as accessible or perspicuous.
Against that backdrop, Jean Tirole of Toulouse University in France being awarded for his research on regulating large firms that display monopolistic tendencies is immensely more palatable, even for those without an economics major. Here is someone who has won the award for research on a subject that in essence protects consumers.
For policymakers all over the world, the French researcher's work is significant. Indeed, for Indian public policy, this year's award is relevant like it has not been for many years. "The nature of scams that have come to the fore recently in India is a reflection of the lack of a regulatory framework.
Tirole's work shows that not only is regulation vital for the growth of healthy capitalism and an entrepreneurial society but is also needed for curtailing crony capitalism," says Anil K Gupta, a professor at IIM Ahmedabad.
Although 'theoretical', Tirole's work has far-reaching implications in our everyday lives. Over the past three decades, he has carried out seminal work on regulations to handle monopolies and more importantly 'oligopolies', sectors which are dominated by a 'few powerful firms'.
His work delves deep into answering some fundamental questions faced by every government. How should governments deal with mergers or cartels, and how should they regulate key sectors dominated by a handful of firms.
Innovation vs Distortion
He showed that the conventional wisdom of capping prices in monopolies and regulating oligopolies works well only in certain conditions, but in others it can be counter-productive. "Price caps can provide dominant firms with strong motives to reduce costs — a good thing for society — but may also permit excessive profits — a bad thing for society... The merger of a firm and its supplier may encourage innovation , but may also distort competition," is how the Academy explains his work.
India has come a long way since 1991— when the licence raj was the norm and private capital was restricted. Gradually, as the economy was opened up for private ventures, a number of independent regulators were set up by the government.
Now, most of the sectors — banking, the securities market and exchanges, telecom, insurance, electricity, petroleum and natural gas — are being supervised by these regulators. There are others in the pipeline, such as a Civil Aviation Authority .

Inflation is down & crude prices have fallen sharply, but the economy is not out of woods. Why?
Avinash Celestine, ET Bureau Oct 19, 2014, 10.06AM IST

Consumer Price Inflation
(Nitsure points out there…)
With both retail and wholesale prices dropping sharply in the recent months, anticipation is higher than ever of that long-awaited event — a cut in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
Consumer price inflation is currently at about 6.5%, seemingly within the comfort zone for the RBI's target of getting prices down to 8% by January. Many analysts, though, see little hope of a rate cut at any point in the next few months at least.
"The RBI has been fighting a fiveyear battle with inflation," says Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist with the Bank of Baroda. "That battle is not going to end that easily."
To be sure, as Nitsure points out, there are good reasons to believe that the decline in inflation in the past couple of months may be purely an artefact of the numbers.
Inflation between September and November last year rose by over two percentage points to close to 12%. Because of this high 'base effect', as statisticians call it, part of the drop in recent months was only to be expected.
"The inflation rate for November will see the lowest number in five years," says Nitsure. "But expect inflation to rise after that."
The RBI is likely to wait and watch for a few months on whether inflation is coming down and will stay low before finally taking a call on interest rates.
India Impact
But there are other concerns as well. The global economy is weak, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its latest global growth forecasts. The notable exception here is the US, which has seen improved growth in recent months with the US unemployment rate falling to 6.1% in August, a level not seen since 2008.
This would normally be seen as a good thing, but markets also take it as a sign that growth increases the risk of inflation rising well above what the US central bank would see as comfortable, forcing it to raise interest rates. "In fact, that's a key risk right now," says economist Abheek Barua, currently with think tank ICRIER.
Analysts see a possible rate hike by the Federal Reserve by the second or third quarter of 2015.
But why should that matter to the Indian economy? A hike in US interest rates, or even the mere expectation among investors, has led to outflows of foreign investor money from emerging markets back to the US. This has happened with little regard to the state of individual markets at that time.
 
"India may do a bit better relative to other Asian markets, but we are still quite vulnerable," says Barua. Even the other big positive for the Indian economy in recent months — the sharp fall in crude oil prices — takes on a more ominous tone when seen in this light.
The decline in prices of crude and other commodities may be just the first signs of this 'capital flight' back to the US, though other factors such as the weakness in key economies of Europe and China have certainly played a role. "The question could well be as to which market is next," says Barua.
Even weak global commodity prices in themselves have an ambiguous effect on the Indian economy. It's good for consumers, but not so good for farmers who can expect relatively meagre earnings across a range of key crops as global prices remain soft. That hurts the earnings of around half the workforce who earn a living from agriculture, and therefore the rural economy.
Structural Issues
An outflow of portfolio capital from the Indian markets would inevitably be seen as having a negative impact on the rupee. Indeed, in real terms, when the differences in inflation rates between India and the rest of the world are taken into account, the rupee is seen as 'overvalued' against key currencies and ripe for a fall. If this does happen, the sharp fall in the price at which India buys crude oil (currently at around $87 per barrel) would be offset partly by a weaker exchange rate.
These 'macro' risks are quite apart from the broader structural issues with the Indian economy, which the new government has only begun to address. As Nitsure points out, apart from industrial growth, bank credit too remains very weak. "Though the government has been active in clearing stalled projects, corporates are still in a wait-and-watch mode," she says. The fall in inflation is a good sign, but the economy is hardly in the clear.

The 20 best business schools for social lifeThe 20 Best Business Schools For Social Life
By Emmie Martin and Mike Nudelman | Business Insider –  Wed 17 Sep, 2014 7:47 PM IST
>
Business school is all about making connections, learning new skills, and sharpening your business prowess.
But students who focus only  on homework and traditional  networking miss out on an important aspect of any college environment: the social scene. 
Even in grad school, where students are under tremendous academic and financial pressure, an active social life is important for success, says Harvey Berkey, chief operating officer of Graduateprograms.com , a website where students can review graduate programs.
On the site, over 70,000 students in the US rank their schools on a 10-point scale across several categories, including academic competitiveness, affordability of living, campus safety, value of network, social life, and workload, which are averaged to create an overall ranking for each school. 
Graduateprograms.com then ranked the business schools with the highest marks for "Social Life" to determine which schools offer students the most in this category. Here are the top schools:

We maintain 60-62 range for the rupee: BofA-MLCrude Oil Prices
("This unwinding is more…)
In a chat with ET Now, Jayesh Mehta, Country Treasurer, BoA Merrill Lynch, talks about the risk to the rupee in the backdrop of the current global situation. Excerpts:
ET Now: The rupee is seeing more downside risk at this point. The range is being adjusted low — between 61 and 62. How do you see it?
Jayesh Mehta: We still maintain 60-62 as a range. We are seeing 61.50 today. Some of the unwinding of the bullish rupee position is not because of negativeness of the rupee, but more because of the dollar strengthening.
That is the reason why some unwinding is taking place. People are now going to watch the equity flow — whether we get the same impact of the US equity into Indian equity. It does not look like it, but that is something which is holding off people.
This unwinding is more about the current market positioning. We still see 62 as a top. We still maintain the lower range at 60, and not 61.
ET Now: Over the past couple of days, global equities have been under pressure. Crude oil prices and other commodity prices have been cooling as well. It is being felt across emerging markets like ours. But interestingly in the last 24 hours, the dollar index seems to have topped out and has receded. Do you think that the continuous rise in dollar index may have halted now?
Jayesh Mehta: It is too early to say anything at this juncture. But definitely, there is a lot of change on the US interest rates, which is slowing down the dollar strengthening against all the currencies. It matters to us, because what happens to the US equities will lead to a reaction in the Indian equities.
It does not look like it at this juncture, but you never know. So, that is something people will watch out for.
For the time being, the situation has become very complicated. Till 10 days or 15 days back, people used to talk about the US rates going up and were prepared for the same. Now we have a complete different trajectory there. Of course, these are all known factors — euro not doing great, Japan not doing great, and so on.
Suddenly, people are taking notice: if the euro is easing up, how can the US actually tighten up? So, it has become a little confusing. On top of that, global inflation looks almost negative. All this put together, we will have to wait and watch how it unfolds.

IPL stakes will influence decision on playersMore
IPL stakes will influence decision on players
The working committee at its emergent meeting will decide on whether the BCCI will take legal action against the WICB.

The BCCI is not amused with West Indies' sudden pullout. (BCCI Photo)How the BCCI deals with the West Indies board, and indeed the entire issue of the abandoned tour, will be dictated to a large extent by the pulls and pressures of its marquee event, the IPL. Some BCCI officials feel the West Indies players should be excluded from the IPL but others, aware of the realpolitik of Indian cricket, have sought to downplay the issue, believing the players should not pay the price for something that was "not entirely their fault".
The IPL governing council is likely to discuss the issue at a meeting in Hyderabad on October 21.
At the heart of the matter is the pulling power of some West Indies players - Chris Gayle , Dwayne Bravo , Kieron Pollard , Sunil Narine and Dwayne Smith - and the fact that they play for some of the most powerful and high-profile franchises. All these players have become synonymous with their respective franchises and are often the face of advertising campaigns. "There is no way we can dictate to the franchises about whom to pick, so officially we cannot take any action against them," said a BCCI functionary, preferring anonymity.
It is also believed that one of the key reasons for BCCI's assistance to the Caribbean players over the last ten days was their importance to the IPL set-up. According to an official in the Caribbean, the players had been assured by the BCCI that their IPL futures were secure. It is understood the players checked with BCCI about a rumour that action would be taken against West Indies players in the current team who played the IPL; the players were reportedly assured that this was not true.
The other complication, for both the BCCI and its West Indies counterpart, is the issue of no-objection certificates, which every overseas player needs from his home board before being allowed to play in the IPL. If the WICB decides to suspend or ban the players who prematurely ended the tour, it will affect the NOCs for the next season. The Bangladesh Cricket Board recently did that with Shakib Al Hasan , who, as things stand, will not be released for the 2015 IPL.
However, any player can be a part of the IPL as a free agent if he retires from international cricket. That's how Kevin Pietersen is expected to play the next season.
This is where the WICB will have to tread gently, for fear of losing its players permanently. It will in fact incur a double loss, because the IPL pays 10% of every player's contract fees to his national board - so the IPL contributes a substantial amount to the WICB coffers. In 2014, 11 West Indies players were signed by various IPL franchises. Three of them, Dwayne Bravo , Sunil Narine and Kieron Pollard were retained by their respective franchises before the season.
Since the 2014 season, the IPL authorities have decided to switch the player contracts with the franchises from three years to a year. This would mean that in case of an informal directive, there will be no technical hassles if the IPL teams are to release all their West Indian cricketers. However, it won't be so easy, as pointed out by a franchise official, considering the "brand value" of many Caribbean cricketers.

Supreme Court to decide whether Travel Ludo, Travel Chess & Draughts and Junior Monopoly are toys, puzzles or games

Funskool India
(Supreme Court to take call…)
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court will soon have to toy over a rather complicated issue — whether Travel Ludo , Travel Chess & Draughts, Travel Snakes & Ladders and Junior Monopoly are toys, puzzles or games.
The matter is serious business for toymaker Funskool India, which stands to lose money in the form of 16% ad valorem duty if the court decides they are games that involve a certain amount of competitive spirit or gambling. In case the court decides they are toys or puzzles, the company will not have to cough up any duty.
Funskool India has conceded to assessing officers that Snakes & Ladders and Monopoly could be treated as games and paid duty on them. Upwords, a product similar to Scrabble, which had earlier been declared a game and not a puzzle, is taxable.
But the company, in a petition filed through Sukumaran & Associates, contested a majority finding by the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT), declaring 18 other products as games. It claimed the Excise Department had wrongly applied the parameters used to differentiate games from puzzles when it assessed toys.
The company also said that because it had conceded Snakes & Ladders and Monopoly were games, the department had insisted all products involving a small amount of skill and dice-based chance should be treated as table or parlour games and should be taxed.
CESTAT classified only eight items as toys — and hence non-taxable — while the rest were considered games, the company argued, urging the top court to declare 18 of its products as toys.
Miniature Versions Designed for Children
Most of the products classified as games were miniature versions designed for children to play with, the company said. The petition was mentioned on October 13 by senior advocate Arvind P Datar before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India HL Dattu, which agreed to examine the plea.
The bench issued notices to the Excise Department but refused to stay the CESTAT ruling of May 23. In some cases, claims relate to five years prior to 2001 while in others they are for the period 2000-2001. CESTAT had set aside penalties on them, allowing the Excise Department to claim only duties and interest.
Under the Excise Tariff Act of 1985, the manufacture and sale of toys, educational toys, puzzles and other toys do not attract any duty. Games, table or parlour games and all board or dice games are taxable.
Parlour games such as carrom, ludo and chess, which are played in game parlours or clubs are taxable. Similarly, table games including table tennis and roulette also attract the levy. According to parameters laid down earlier by the top court, ludo, chess and monopoly are games as their outcome cannot be predicted and they involve skill or chance or both. A product is a puzzle only if its outcome is predetermined. A puzzle involves no luck, but clues.

Three easy steps by which you can climate-proof your cityBENTHEMPLEIN WATER SQUARE
(On a rainy day when it seems…)
Water logged roads, endless traffic jams have become par for the course on rainy days in cities across the world. In Indian cities, the growing volume of cars, burgeoning urban populations, and massive rise in built-up areas have only made rainy days a nightmare. Add to that the growing threat of extreme rainfall events, which are bound to increase in periodicity and intensity on account of climate change.
But with competing demands on space, local governments in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore or Kolkata are finding it difficult to address this new problem. The port city of Rotterdam in The Netherlands provides interesting solutions to managing and storing excess water. Rotterdam faces all these challenges and one more— it is six metres below sea level. Located in the delta of the Rhine and Meuse rivers, nearly 90% of the Dutch port city is below sea level.
So it isn't just heavy rains that threaten Rotterdam, the rising sea level makes it imperative for the city to find ways to ensure that excess water keeps flowing out. In 2008, the Rotterdam city administration took a decision to climate proof the city.
"It was a paradigm shift, how to combine urban design with adapting to climate change," explained Arnoud Molenaar, manager of the city's climate initiative, Rotterdam Climate Proof. Molenaar explained that in dealing with heavy and extreme rainfall that was becoming more common due to climate change, the city had to find a way to control the flooding.
"We are a country that has always invested in keeping the water out, but sometimes that is not enough, it was necessary to find ways to manage the water." The trick that Rotterdam mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb realized was to show the city the opportunities that climate initiatives presented— hence the idea of an urban public space, underground parking and rowing track, all of which double up as water storage areas.
BENTHEMPLEIN WATER SQUARE
On a regular sunny day, Benthemplein looks like any other urban space— a colourfully done up open space. With its basketball hoops and amphitheatre like seating, the square doubles up as an open play space for the adjoining school or another spot where the school goers can hang out at break time. But Benthemplein is no ordinary public square.
On a rainy day when it seems that roads will be waterlogged, Benthemplein doubles up as rain water storage area. The sunk-in design, which allows for the amphitheatre like seating, helps transform the "square" into a water storage area. The two additional basins, which are located on either side of the main square fill up first. These have sloping edges which allow for the overflow from the steel gutters to be collected. The water remains in a temporary storage area before moving through the sewage and water pipes through the treatment units and finally into the nearest water body without overburdening the system.
  "The underground is so packed that there is no way to put in more pipes to deal with the excess water. So, we needed a system that would take the water off the streets and let it move slowly into the water canals," explained Arnoud Molenaar. Designed by the Rotterdam-based architecture firm, DeUrbanisten, the Benthemplein water square can hold up to 1700 cubic metres of water. The square was built at a cost of 2.5 million euros, with a subsidy of 1.2 million euros from the European Commission.
UNDERGROUND PARKING AND WATER STORAGE AT MUSEUMPARK
There is more to this underground car park than meets the eye—it has an underground storage facility with a capacity to store 10,000 cubic metre. The water is kept in this storage area and later pumped into the sewers, and treated for release into water canals when the system is no longer under pressure.
The storage was built at a cost of 11 million euros, and utilized a section of the underground parking that could not be used for cars, explained Bas de Wildt, advisor in the Rotterdam city's public works departments. Besides relieving pressure on the sewage system, this storage system ensures that untreated sewage water is not released into the water canals during the rains. The city's water management system relies heavily on canals.
"But when there is heavy rains, it is difficult to pump the rain water into the system fast enough,' de Wildt explained. The underground system allowed for a way out to hold the excess water in an unobtrusive manner till it could be treated and released."
WILLEM-ALEXANDER BAAN ROWING COURSE
The Willem-Alexander Baan, located 20 minutes by road from Rotterdam, in the Eendragtspolder, is another example of multifunctional approach to water storage - an international rowing track which is really a 300 hectare water storage area.

New Delhi, Oct 18: Former Australian World Cup winning captains Allan Border, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting are of the opinion that leading India in all three formats of the game is troubling Mahendra Singh Dhoni, especially in Tests, and Virat Kohli must be groomed to take over the Test captaincy.
"Probably it is because he plays a lot, ranging all the three forms of cricket. He is a highly competitive guy and handles the pressures in One-Day Internationals (ODI) and Twenty20 Internationals really nicely. But the Tests are a different ball game," Waugh said at the Aaj Tak conclave Salaam Cricket here Saturday.
"In the five-day game, Dhoni looks jaded and worn out. Seriously, for Tests, India should start grooming Kohli and other guys to take over from him," added Waugh, who led the Australian cricket team to the 1999 World Cup title in England.
Ponting, who led the Aussies to the 2003 and 2007 edition titles, said that tactical and strategic changes will help Dhoni, whose team lost back-to-back away Test series in England and Australia.
"In ODIs and the matches held at home, he is happy to put fielders at boundaries and waits for the batsman to make mistakes with the support of the pitches which helps his set of bowlers. But these things don't work in away tours," said Ponting.
"Especially in Test matches, in places like Australia, England, you need to build the pressure from the beginning and don't allow the game to continue. You not only need to restrict the flow of runs but also pick up wickets. So, it becomes troublesome for him."
Border also echoed the the duo's sentiments.
"Dhoni is a tough character. Particularly in Tests, he should be more active and should not let the game drift away," said Border, who was the skipper of the Australian team which won the World Cup in 1987 in India.
"I don't have any doubts about his commitment for the Test match. He is a very competitive guy. Also, he is leading India in all forms of cricket which is a huge task. But in these circumstances, the seniors of the team must contribute to the thinking part."

Air India planning shift to outright purchaseA-320 neo
(While leaseback turns out…)
NEW DELHI: Air India is proposing to shift from sale and leaseback to outright purchase of 15 of the 27 Dreamliner aircraft it has ordered, in a bid to save about $225-300 million as part of the turnaround plan.
A proposal to this effect has been sent to the government for approval, as the national carrier feels that the shift to the outright purchase system would provide a much better internal rate of return, airline officials said here.
While leaseback turns out to be more expensive in the long run, an airline does not get the benefit of the residual value of an aircraft after its lease expires as it is enjoyed by the lessor, they said.
Sale and leaseback is a financial transaction where one sells an asset and leases it back on a long term and continues to use it without owning it.
The sources said the redelivery cost (after the lease expires) of a widebody aircraft like the Dreamliners is very high at almost $20 million while for narrow-bodies it is about $10-12 million.
Such high redelivery costs would be avoided if the planes are owned by the company, the officials said.
Air India, which has seven aircraft on leaseback and has offered five more through that process, now plans to turn to the outright purchase mode for the remaining 15, they said.
At present, the airline has a total of 17 Dreamliners in its fleet with one more slated to be delivered in December. The last of these planes is to be delivered by September 2016.
Under the future global accounting system International Financial Reporting Standards which would become mandatory for all nations in a few years, all long-term leases would have to be shown as both assets and liabilities which would also enhance the burden on the airline's aircraft leases, the sources said.
Air India is also evaluating whether to induct the latest Airbus A-320 neo (New Engine Option) aircraft into its fleet after 2017, which the manufacturer claims to be a major fuel-saving airplane.
In one of the largest orders in terms of number of aircraft, IndiGo had last week ordered 250 of these A-320 neos.
On the financial front, Air India's financial and operational parameters have shown a marked improvement between April and September this year, registering an 11 per cent growth in network revenue at Rs 8,114 crore up from Rs 7,289 crore reported during the same period last year.
The airline was able to achieve this despite the period being a lean season when most airlines report a decline in the number of passengers carried.
The passenger load factor at 73.5 per cent on domestic and 74.8 per cent on international sectors exceeded the target of 73 and 74 per cent respectively, thus increasing the yields at a time of stiff competition posed by the no-frill carriers and their low fare offers, the officials said.

Government mulls panel to resurrect big infra projects

Bank of India
(The committee is proposed…)
NEW DELHI: Big infrastructure projects that are stalled and can't be saved through the usual ways such as by restructuring debt are set to get another look, with the government planning to set up a panel to consider their revival.
The committee is proposed to be headed by SB Nayar, head of staterun India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL). It will consider infrastructure projects of above RS. 2,500 crore and will have the mandate to explore mechanisms outside the established norms to bring them back on track.
"The committee can recommend and facilitate takeover of these projects by other interested parties," said a senior executive at IIFCL. "Preliminary discussions have taken place with the government and banks." The panel will have representation from lenders who have exposure to such stalled projects, the official said.
The new committee will not take up projects which are already being monitored by the Project Monitoring Group in the cabinet secretariat. This group was set up to fast-track big infrastructure and industrial projects that are held up for want of various government approvals.The government wants to push through infrastructure projects to quicken growth after two years of sub-5 per cent economic expansion. Infrastructure is key to overall economic growth and experts estimate that India's creaky infrastructure such as roads and ports shave as much as two percentage points off the country's gross domestic product.
Indicators such as the Index of Industrial Production, which expanded at a five-month low pace of 0.4 per cent in August, and annual credit growth that fell below 10 per cent for the first time in five years, point to GDP growth taking a hit in the July-September quarter. Meanwhile, the government's efforts so far to boost infrastructure investment haven't shown any significant increase in the purchase of capital goods. The committee that the government proposes to set up will have independent observers as well, and will give recommendations to the government and the Reserve Bank of India for suitable action.
"So, there could be a case for 'onetime special dispensation', or projects where an outside agency can be brought in to resolve the impasse," the IIFCL official said. Some bankers, however, aren't convinced about the proposal. "It depends on how much mandate this committee enjoys and what recommendations it makes and which ones are accepted," said an executive director of a state-run bank. He asked not to be named. The chairman of a state-run bank said the lenders may not have much to do if the proposals are outside of corporate debt restructuring (CDR).

Black Money
(In an application to the…)
NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government made a volte face of sorts on Friday when it cited the same reasons that the previous Congress-led regime had given to keep secret the names of people who have allegedly stashed black money in overseas accounts.
In an application to the Supreme Court , which had directed the government to reveal those names, the government said such a step would lead to violation of the nation's existing double-taxation-avoidance agreements with other countries.
Revealing the bank account details without even establishing prima facie grounds to establish any wrongdoing would also amount to an invasion of privacy, it said. One of BJP's poll promises was to recover the black money parked in foreign banks, which some reports peg at as much as Rs 70,000 crore. The party had accused the Congress of being unwilling to bring back the money and book the tax evaders. On Friday, Attorney General Mukul Rohtagi urged the court to tweak its order to reveal the names to Ram Jethmalani , the senior lawyer and a former BJP minister who had filed a public interest litigation on the matter.
The Congress seized upon the opportunity, with spokesman Abhishek Singhvi saying that the development has exposed the "hypocrisy" of the Modi government. "Will the Prime Minister apologise for giving false hopes to the public," he asked.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley denied the allegation that his government was reluctant to reveal the names of tax evaders. "Where is the question of propaganda? We have no problems in making the names public under the due process of law, and the treaty commitment by a previous government, whether good or bad, is process of law," he said.
The government's application said it could share information only on cases in which the government had initiated criminal prosecution and hence the cases were in the court. In such cases, the information is anyway available in public domain, it added. Rohtagi urged the court to hear the plea soon.
He said countries sharing such reciprocal information had objected to revealing that of to the public. "If you want to get information from other countries, we have to abide by treaties," the AG said. This prompted Jethmalani, who is no more part of the BJP, to accuse the new government of trying to "protect the culprits".

Black money: Switzerland ready to share data with IndiaArun Jaitley
(The amount of Indian money…)
NEW DELHI: India and Switzerland have been able to achieve a breakthrough in their deadlock over banking secrecy laws in the European nation that prevented tax authorities from being able to unearth black money, a day-one priority for the Narendra Modi-led NDA government.
The agreement will not only let Indian tax authorities keep tabs on their countrymen who spend large amounts of money in Switzerland but, as part of an accord covering four areas, they can also obtain information about accounts in the socalled 'HSBC list' if it can be confirmed that independent investigations are being conducted into them.
"The government of India is taking all necessary steps to access tax-related information from foreign governments," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Friday, detailing the progress made on this front with Switzerland. "Black money stashed abroad will be brought back."
India had received the HSBC list of account-holders cited above from France through a bilateral treaty but Switzerland has so far refused to give out any information regarding this, saying that it was based on stolen data. It has been widely reported that the list originated from information stolen by a disgruntled HSBC Geneva employee in 2011.
Agreement Concluded in Bern
"A breakthrough was reached that in cases where there is independent investigation in India and evidence is collected in India, those details in relation to those accounts will be provided even if those accounts are on the HSBC list. So that absolute prohibition which the Swiss have imposed no longer exists," the finance minister said.
The two sides concluded their agreement in Bern earlier this week. The Indian team was led by revenue secretary Shaktikanta Das and the Swiss side by his counterpart Jacques de Watteville. Switzerland has also agreed to validate the authenticity of bank documents besides banking and non-banking information in a time-bound manner that will make Indian tax investigations robust besides allowing officials to realise levies well in time. Tax authorities were sometimes unable to initiate proceedings and winkle out dues owing to delays in the availability of information. Das declined to give details of non-banking transactions that could be reported.
The European country has also agreed to begin deliberations with India on the automatic exchange of information (AEOI) framework and provide timebound details in pending cases. Switzerland and other tax havens have come under increasing global pressure to ease confidentiality rules as governments seek to pursue those accused of evading taxes as well as criminals and terrorists trying to hide money trails. Several cases initiated by the Indian authorities have been stuck because authorities in the European tax haven have refused to divulge information, citing the banking secrecy laws that have long made it a refuge for those seeking to deposit large amounts of money with few questions asked.
The Narendra Modi government, which set up a special investigation team to probe black money on its first day in office, is giving high priority to tackling unaccounted money and tax evasion through non-intrusive methods. The focus has thus shifted toward getting and using information received from different countries effectively through the use of information technology.
The amount of Indian money parked in Swiss banks rose by more than 40% to Rs 14,000 crore at the end of 2013 from Rs 9,000 crore at the end of 2012, according to Swiss central bank estimates. India itself tracks a number of high-value transactions including investments in mutual funds, property, jewellery purchases and overseas travel though annual information returns as also other means.
The government allows Indians to have bank accounts overseas but any money held there should be tax paid and also disclosed to the local tax authorities. There has been a growing perception over the past few years that several Indians have stashed black money in tax havens taking advantage of secrecy laws.
Under global pressure, Switzerland had agreed to ease its rules on confidentiality in recent years and also signed a revised tax treaty with India in 2011 to facilitate greater flow of information on tax evaders. It has now also agreed to enter into discussions with India on automatic information exchange as per globally accepted models. India is one of the early adopters of the new global information-exchange regime.

(Khurshid today said the…)
NEW DELHI: Former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid today said the NDA government should either "scrap" agreements with foreign nations in "national interest" over not disclosing black money details or "apologise" for attacking the previous UPA government which had taken a similar stand.
Targeting the Narendra Modi dispensation for its stand in Supreme Court today that it cannot disclose names of all Indians having black money stashed in bank accounts abroad, he said the BJP had cast aspersions at the UPA government for taking a similar stand.
"They (government) should not say what they can do and blame us for this. I want to make it clear that they should withdraw from the agreement and fulfil the promise (on black money) they had made before the country.
"Or, they should apologise for casting aspersions on us even though we were doing what was appropriate for the country...," Khurshid told reporters.
The Congress leader said if India suffers due to scrapping the agreement with foreign countries but if it is required to be done in national interest, then the government should do it.
"After casting aspersions at us, the new government is repeating what we had been saying. Why? Because we have treaties so we cannot disclose details. You did not respect it when you were in opposition, then why are you respecting it now," Khurshid said.
The Modi government, which promised to bring back black money stashed by Indians in foreign banks, today toed the line of UPA regime by informing the Supreme Court that it cannot disclose such details given by countries with which India has double taxation avoidance agreement(DTAA).

Apple embarks on biggest pan-India launch before DiwaliApple has been seeking to remedy its former neglect of India as a market by stepping up its sales efforts, including exchange offers and now midnight sales.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI | CHENNAI | KOLKATA | MUMBAI: Apple's first midnight launch saw buyers queueing up from Thursday night at stores that stayed specially open to allow those who'd pre-ordered the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to be the first to get them. The company has been seeking to remedy its former neglect of India as a market for smartphones, currently dominated by Samsung and others, by stepping up its sales efforts, including exchange offers, installment plans and now midnight sales.
People who'd pre-ordered the devices and many who didn't lined up at stores across the big Indian cities. "I came in early, so I got a chance to be among the first few," said 25-year-old Didar Singh, who picked up an iPhone 6 Plus from a reseller in an upmarket south Delhi locality, having reached the store at around 9.30 pm.
He was among about 250 people queuing up at four stores holding midnight iPhone sales at the market in Greater Kailash. On hand were bean bags, free energy drinks and a big TV screen on which a countdown started at 11.30 pm.
The launch is part of Apple's bid to drum up excitement about the new devices as it seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the Indian market and attempts to compete with rivals unveiling new devices. The India iPhone launch followed sales openings in the US and other markets on September 19. Thursday also saw the unveiling of upgraded iPads in the US by Apple while Google announced a new phone and tablet the previous day. Rival Samsung has recently launched the Samsung Galaxy Alpha and started selling the Note 4 on Friday.
In Gurgaon, a Starbucks outlet stayed open late to provide sustenance to those waiting for iPhone sales to start. There was a significant police presence as well, to keep the peace. The demand, more for the iPhone 6 than the 6 Plus, wasn't restricted to Delhi and Mumbai, with Kolkata and Chennai also seeing an unprecedented rush for the devices as Apple embarked on its biggest pan-India launch. India is a focus area for the Cupertino-based company as underlined by CEO Tim Cook's references to it in recent comments.
Enthusiasm for the devices was "surprisingly high in Kolkata," said Himanshu Chakrawarti, CEO of The Mobile Store, India's largest cellphone retail chain. "The first day and this weekend will be all about providing the new handsets to the pre-booked customers and we will start booking again from Saturday to ensure that customers can get it when fresh inventory arrives," said Chakrawarti.
Harirul Anam Khan, a third-year B Com student, was happy to buy the champagne gold iPhone 6 for Rs 53,500, although he had pre-registered for the space gray version, which was unlikely to be in stock anytime soon, he was told. "I use an iPhone 4S now, but couldn't resist upgrading to an iPhone 6," he said.
There was a "a huge crowd" at the UniverCell store in Chennai for the midnight launch, said D Sathish Babu, co-founder of the chain. "People had turned up with their family and friends and many kept updating their status on social networking sites like Facebook. It was fun, but as soon as the phones came in, the fun gave way to chaos. The phones got sold out soon," he said.
There was disappointment for many who hadn't pre-registered but turned up in the hope of getting what has become an aspirational product for many Indians like Akshay Agarwal, a 28-year-old Delhi-based blogger who sold off his three smartphones to buy an iPhone 6.
Just ahead of Diwali, there is concern that Apple may not be able to keep up with demand. The Apple India team has asked the parent to rush another 50,000-55,000 units by early next week, according to two senior executives close to Apple's trade team. "There is a strong indication that fresh stocks will hit by Monday evening so that Apple can make the maximum of Dhanteras and Diwali sales," said one of them. Some stores weren't that hopeful about an early replenishment of stocks.
A store manager in Kolkata said it had stopped taking any pre-orders until fresh supplies from distributors Ingram Micro and Redington arrived to help with its immediate delivery commitment of some 60-80 units. "We are telling new customers who haven't pre-booked to expect fresh stocks only by November-end."

Why Apple s brand new iPad Mini is not worth the extra moneyWhy Apple's brand new iPad Mini is not worth the extra money
By Business Insider | 17 Oct, 2014, 04.14PM IST
The iPad mini 3 also has the fingerprint sensor. It's also sold in one new color: gold. But that's it, as far as the "new" in the iPad mini 3.

Save precious time tracking your investments
Apple unveiled some new products on Thursday, including a couple of new iPads.
Well, only one of those iPads is "new," really. The iPad Air 2 is faster, thinner, and more secure thanks to the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which will allow owners to use Apple Pay for shopping online.
The iPad mini 3 also has the fingerprint sensor. It's also sold in one new color: gold. But that's it, as far as the "new" in the iPad mini 3.
The iPad mini 3 has the same 7.9-inch Retina display, the same 7.5 mm thickness, and the same A7 chip with M7 coprocessor from last year's Retina iPad mini. Even the FaceTime and iSight cameras are exactly the same.
Don't believe it? Scroll through Apple's comparison of tech specs across the iPad family, and look at the iPad mini 3 and iPad mini 2, which are side by side. The only difference between last year and this year the "fingerprint identity sensor."
And yet, the new iPad mini costs $100 more than last year's iPad mini.
So if you want a truly "new" tablet, you're better off going for the iPad Air 2, which is significantly thinner or more powerful. Unless you're obsessed with gold or you really want Touch ID in your tiny tablet, you're better off saving $100 and buying the iPad mini 2.

Will Apple be successful in reigniting interest in the iPadCatch with new iPads is that it is not expected to bring back incredible, triple-per cent growth in sales that the iPad achieved in its first few years.

CUPERTINO: Maturity is an asset in so many things. But it's a bit of a dirty word to tech companies when describing consumer appetite for their products.
Yet it is a maturing market that Apple may be coping with as it tries to reignite sales of its iPad tablet computing devices. On Thursday, Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, unveiled the next generation of Apple iPads, the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3.
The new devices have fingerprint sensors that could make shopping online as easy as swiping a button. And in the case of the more expensive iPad Air 2, it is also faster, has a better camera, and is thinner than last year's version. So thin, in fact, that Cook said it was skinnier than a pencil. To make his point, Apple produced a video where a laser beam shaved off bits of a pencil to make it as slender as the new tablet.
"It's unbelievably gorgeous and look how thin it is. Can you even see it?" Cook said, holding the new iPad in front of an audience of journalists and Apple employees at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters.
But it is not clear that making the iPad Air 2 the Twiggy of tablet devices will be enough to reinvigorate Apple's iPad sales, which have slumped recently.
Analysts speculate that the new iPads, which will be available Oct. 24, will contribute to modest sales growth. What the new iPads will not do is bring back the incredible, triple-per cent growth in sales that the iPad achieved in its first few years, starting in 2010.
"That was just crazy growth," said Ben Bajarin, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies. "The iPad has normalized because it's mature. It's not going to go back to 180 per cent growth, but it is still growing."
Now about that svelte look: Apple said the iPad Air 2 was 18 per cent thinner and 40 per cent faster than the last one, a surprising change - and a bit of an engineering feat - because Apple made the previous version thinner and faster just last year.
The iPad Air 2 also has a display designed to reduce reflections. The tablet has 10 hours of battery life, same as the previous version. It has a starting price of $500. The iPad Mini 3 starts at $400 - but it is not thinner than the last version. Apple has added a gold color option to both models.
The fingerprint sensor in both tablets is called Touch ID. The technology is used to log into the iPad in place of a typed passcode. It can also be used to make in-app purchases with Apple's new mobile payments system, Apple Pay, which will be available Monday.
The iOS 8.1 system, the next update for the software system that runs Apple's mobile devices, will also be available Monday. Apple has made big changes to its iPads more quickly than it has with other Apple products, like the iPhone, which has typically been redesigned every two years.
Why the difference? For one, an iPad gives Apple's engineers more physical space to tinker around. And from a business standpoint, Apple has to do more with the iPad to maintain healthy sales.

In Maharashtra, small parties harbour big hopes

(In Maharashtra, the split…)
MUMBAI: In Maharashtra , the split in grand alliances has pumped up the expectations of small parties. They hope to win more seats in multi-cornered contests and play a decisive role in government-making, while rubbishing exit-poll results that predict them to have a smaller combined number than last time in the state assembly.
More than 30 small parties had put up their candidates in the assembly elections, results of which will become clear on Sunday. Popular exit-polls suggest the BJP to emerge as the largest party in the 288-member assembly, and, in one case, even with enough MLAs to form the government on its own. The BJP and Shiv Sena, and the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party had broken up their alliances just before the elections.
The exit polls predict between five and 22 seats for independents and parties other than the big four. In the last assembly, they had 40. Most of these parties and some analysts don't agree with the predictions. In many constituencies, multicornered contests have aligned voters in favour of smaller parties such as the All India Majlis-Ittehadul-Muslimeen, Bahujan Vikas Aaghadi and Swabhimani Paksh, said Dhawal Vasavada, election research manager at Political Edge, a Gurgaon-based consultancy that handled the poll campaign for several candidates.
"Such vote alignment has upped the chances of candidates who were not expecting to contest the elections on such a strong wicket." The Bahujan Vikas Aaghadi party is expecting to win up to five of the 25 seats it contested from. The party had two MLAs in the outgoing assembly. Exit polls are difficult to believe, said party president and former MLA Hitendra Thakur, who contested from Vasai this time.
The BJP could be the single largest party, but coming with majority is unlikely to happen, he said. And, which party would he support in case of a hung assembly? "Until now I have supported secular parties and I will continue to be with them."

KOLKATA: India's foreign exchange reserves rose $1.310 billion for the week to October 10, snapping a five week fall in a row.
The reserves stood at $312.737 billion, Reserve Bank of India said Friday.
The central bank does not give reasons behind the rise or fall of reserves but some forex dealers said that RBI has possibly bought dollars from the forward market last week.
Before this reporting week, reserves had fallen by about $7.2 billion in the previous five weeks on valuation changes.
Valuation of India's foreign currency asset holding in euro, pound or Japanese yen fell as dollar gained sharply against these major global currencies.

How Amit Shah and his team of four leaders helped BJP take roots in Haryana

CHANDIGARH:For over one and a half months, a few bigwigs from the BJP camped in Rohtak, the constituency of Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, shaping the party's campaign in the state ahead of the elections that took place on October 15.
If the BJP emerges as the single largest party after the votes are counted on Sunday, as projected by various exit polls, it will be largely due to the planning and execution by these heavyweights, who operated out of a rival party's citadel. ET profiles the men who worked behind the scenes on aspects such as ticket distribution, managing rallies and imparting the 'killer instinct' to BJP workers in the state.
BHAJANS & KILLER ISNTINCT
Kailash Vijayvargiya: The Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Minister who was named by party president Amit Shah as the election in-charge for Haryana, Vijayvargiya is known for two unique traits. He prefers to sing bhajans to convey messages to party workers instead of making lengthy, mundane speeches. Secondly, he has the ability to instill the "killer instinct" in party workers.
"Till now, BJP supporters had been contesting but the confidence and the killer instinct was lacking. It was Vijayvargiya ji who infused this in party workers," said a senior BJP leader. It was Vijayvargiya's brainchild to ensure the BJP got the support of the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda.
THE BACKUP PROVIDER
Dr Anil Jain: A national secretary of the BJP, Jain was jointly in charge of the Haryana campaign. His main tasks were twofold: to decide the venues and manage all the rallies held by Modi, the party's star campaigner, and to pick candidates to contest the election. "All the rallies held by PM were managed by Dr Jain. He also played a crucial role in selecting candidates," a BJP leader said.
THE POLITICAL TRAINER
Shiv Prakash: Recently recruited from the RSS, Prakash, the BJP's Joint General Secretary (Organisation), played a significant role in bringing party workers together as a cohesive team. Sources told ET that Prakash was involved in the "intricate planning" of campaigning, imparted "political training" to workers and helped them understand the pulse of the electorate.
THE MENTOR
Ram Lal: The BJP's national organisation secretary brought much needed "discipline" among party workers. "He is a fatherly figure whose words of wisdom brought discipline and focus in the party workers," a party leader told ET.

BJP may name non-Jat as Haryana CM if it gets absolute majoritySenior party sources indicated that such a choice will only be in keeping with the overwhelming support that the BJP mustered from non-jats.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: BJP may prefer someone other than a jat for chief ministership of Haryana should exit poll predictions about the party getting an absolute majority in the 90-strong House come true.
Senior party sources indicated that such a choice will only be in keeping with the overwhelming support that the BJP mustered from non-jats. They said the party, which fielded 27 jats, 19 of them with strong credentials, received a big chunk of votes of the dominant community, which accounts for more than one-fifth of the electorate.
However, the party's strong showing in the state where it has so far been a fringe player, forced to ride piggyback on a non-Congress outfit, has been made possible because of the support it got from other communities. A senior party functionary claimed that dalits, who make up 20% of the electorate, voted overwhelmingly for saffron candidates.
Besides dalits, BJP also succeeded in enlisting significant support from upper castes like Brahmins, Banias and Rajputs as well as non-jat OBCs like Ahirs (Yadavs), Gujjars and Sainis who put together represent almost half the electorate.
The party leadership has also decided to pitch for the inclusion of a jat representative in the central government when Prime Minister Narendra Modi carries out his first ministerial restructuring.
Justifying their preference for a candidate other than jat for the post of CM, sources said dalits switching to BJP prevented Om Prakash Chautala's INLD from building on his formidable jat base. The shift of other non-jatav castes to the BJP column also hurt Congress and Haryana Janhit Congress, both of which had posed itself as bulwark against Chautala's aggressive pro-jat platform.

Narendra Modi wave in Maharashtra, Haryana; will do a Dhoom II: Prakash Javadekar

(Javadekar said that the…)
NEW DELHI: With exit polls predicting a BJP victory in Maharashtra and Haryana, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar Friday said the polls predicted "clearly a Modi wave" and that the ruling party was going to do a "Dhoom II" success story in the two states.
Speaking to media persons at the Foreign Correspondents Club of South Asia, Javadekar said "the overall prediction of exit polls has shown clearly a Modi wave", and added that "if the Lok Saba elections was a "Dhoom" then this is "Dhoom II".
"It (victory streak) is being continued in the same vein," he said referring to the hugely popular Bollywood film "Dhoom" and its equally super-hit sequel.
Javadekar said that the election results are "all about the aspirations of the poor" who want to better their lives and those of their children and not be treated as a vote bank any longer.
"The elections are about the changing psychology of the poor who don't want to remain poor any longer. They want to live with dignity.. There is a new change in Indian society. Modi reflects their aspirations.. People want a government that can deliver, will deliver on promises and give good governance," he said.
He said in these assembly elections people are not looking to vote according to "caste and other smaller things they used to earlier".
The minister said that the public participation campaign launched by the Narendra Modi government "is changing mindsets and transforming India".
Referring to the Swachch Bharat Clean India campaign, he said it was not just to clean India but the "changing the way we live".
He said under earlier governments the model was that "everything will be done by the government" but now Prime Minister Modi is changing mindsets through public participation.
"People are becoming active agents of change which India needs".
On the economic front, he said the government had "showcased its vision" in the budget and that the petrol prices had come down by Rs.8 and diesel was also set to come down by Rs.2-3, "which shows the government wants to pass on all benefits to consumers".
Javadekar said since the government came in to power in May "all departments have started taking decisions, based on policies", which, he said, should not be referred to as merely clearing of files.
He claimed that under the Modi government "there is fresh thinking in all departments".
"The prime minister takes pains in giving confidence to the bureaucracy. He spent four-five hours with each minister and secretary and discussed all issues relating to the ministry," he added.

DLF moves Securities Appellate Tribunal against ban orderCitigroup
(I-banks involved in the…)
MUMBAI: Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) may examine the role of merchant bankers in DLF's maiden equity offering in 2007, a prospect that has caused considerable disquiet among the fraternity. Though the capital market regulator is yet to send a legal notice to any of the investment banks involved with the real estate developer's initial public offer (IPO), bankers are worried about the implications of the recent Sebi order on the way they operate.
Some bankers are in touch with Sebi officials to understand the regulator's thinking about the ambit of their responsibility when it comes to disclosures made by clients, said three senior investment bankers aware of the interactions with the regulators. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
On Monday, Sebi barred DLF and its promoters from accessing the capital markets for three years for not disclosing material information to investors. DLF on Friday filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal — a quasi-judicial body — challenging the order. I-banks involved in the IPO were DSP Merrill Lynch, Kotak, Citigroup, Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Equities, ICICI Securities, UBS Securities and SBI Capital Markets.
I-bankers Plead Helplessness
The crux of the argument put forward by worried merchant bankers is that they essentially outsource the legal compliance and drafting of the prospectus to law firms. They also rely upon the word of auditors when it comes to disclosures. Importantly, they say they have no wherewithal to carry out detailed due diligence in areas that are the domain of law firms and auditors.
"Investment bankers primarily rely on chartered accountants and lawyers to verify the information provided by the company for a public offer. We don't do independent due diligence," said an i-banker with a local investment bank. "For tax issues, bankers verify with the chartered accountants and other company-related matters with the lawyers. In fact, in the prospectus, investment bankers say the information documented is based on disclosures given by chartered accountants and lawyers as it's re-validated and confirmed by them. Bankers only file it with Sebi," he said.
The primary responsibility to make sure that all disclosures have been made does indeed rest upon the company and its directors, lawyers say. But merchant bankers have to ensure they carry out proper due diligence.
"From a regulatory perspective, the disclosure obligation cannot be contracted away. The regulator will penalise those it can under the law. However, there are two aspects — first, under the relevant regulations and guidelines, which will be enforced by the regulator against those who it regulates; and second, under the contractual relationship between the company and its advisors, which will be enforced by the parties to the contract," said Suhail Nathani, partner of law firm Economic Laws Practice.
The company, in a press statement, on Monday said its board was guided by and acted on the advice of eminent legal advisors, merchant bankers and audit firms while formulating its offer documents. Some lawyers said the regulator can proceed against merchant bankers as well as audit firms following the precedent set by the travails of Price Waterhouse — the auditors of erstwhile Satyam Computers, which imploded in 2008.
Unlike merchant bankers, law firms and auditors are not registered with Sebi, but if they provide advice on dealing in securities market then they can come under the regulator's jurisdiction as they are persons associated with the securities market. In 2010, the Bombay High Court ruled on a writ petition filed by Price Waterhouse challenging Sebi's jurisdiction over it that audit forms could come under the market regulator's scanner if there was a criminal nexus between a company and its auditors. There has been no further development in the matter since then.
"On the lines of the Price Waterhouse judgement, one would not be surprised if SEBI chooses to intiate action against merchant bankers to the issue, if they are found negligent or accomplice in the suppression of true and correct position. Sebi has already issued orders against DLF, which would go a long way from corporate governance standard point of view," said Vaneesa Abhishek, a practising lawyer.
In DLF's red herring prospectus, it was stated that Sebi reserves the right to take up at any point of time, with the book runners, any irregularities or lapses in the prospectus. "Under the code of conduct for merchant bankers, they are required to exercise due diligence and make all efforts to protect the interests of investors. They are also responsible for ensuring that adequate disclosures are made to investors in accordance with applicable regulations. Merchant bankers are also supposed to certify that the disclosures made in the prospectus are true, fair and adequate," Abhishek said.

KP Singh: The man who built Gurgaon out of nothingBritish Airways
(“He is among the first…)
NEW DELHI: There is little Kushal Pal Singh hasn't seen. He built the city of Gurgaon out of nothingness. He also saw it begin to crumble under its own weight. He almost sold DLF for Rs 26 lakh, but later also saw the value of his shareholding in it climb to Rs 1,87,920 crore. Now, it's declined to just Rs 14,701 crore. In 2007, he was celebrated for bringing India's biggest IPO.
Seven years later, he stands condemned by Sebi, for failing to disclose material information in that very offer. He has also seen both friends and foes occupy high places.
"He is among the first who had the vision of a large-sized modern building that is as good as any in developed countries," says Hemendra Kothari, a veteran investment banker. Now, cash flow questions are being asked about many of his ongoing property projects. "Consistent with the title of his autobiography 'Whatever the Odds', his ride is neither smooth nor straightforward. It is evident that KP Singh has cut corners," says ASV Krishnan, senior research analyst at Ambit Capital.
When KP Singh ventured into Gurgaon in late seventies, no one would have imagined what it would become over the next few decades. Good fortune and intent and perseverance all played a part.
His now famous chance meeting with Rajiv Gandhi and his partnership approach with farmers from whom he bought land from are both legendary.
"Amidst the vast landscape of barren land that was once Gurgaon, he had the vision and foresight to see the potential to create a world class city," says a real estate developer who has followed DLF for many years. KP Singh also escorted General Electric into India in 1989, leading to the birth of the BPO industry. At that time, foreign companies were wary about doing business in India.
But Singh persuaded General Electric in Gurgaon to open its pilot office for outsourcing companies. Gurgaon later became home to many multinational including Nestle, American Express, PepsiCo, IBM , British Airways and Ericsson. Born on August 15, 1931 at Bulandshahar in Uttar Pradesh, Singh graduated in Science from Meerut College. He went to UK to study Aeronautical Engineering where he was selected to the prestigious Indian Army , by British Officers Services Selection Board, UK. He joined the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun and was later on commissioned into The Deccan Horse — a renowned cavalry regiment of The Indian Army.
His competitors have nothing but respect for him. "KP Singh has seen many ups and down," says a veteran CEO of another real estate firm, requesting not to be named. "But he has the trait to bounce back."

Gruh Finance, Repco are multi-baggers: Basant Maheshwari
ET Now Oct 18, 2014, 09.18PM IST
(IT is in a bullish phase, pharma could…)
In an interview with ET Now, Basant Maheshwari, Author, The Thoughtful Investor, shares his views on the markets as well as some sectors and stocks. Excerpts:
Nikunj Dalmia: 2014 has been a dream year for the Indian markets on all accounts, whether it is politics, macros or earnings. Indian markets have got rerated. Is this as good as it gets?
Basant Maheshwari: The rerating has to be looked in a context. Whenever a bull market starts, the bad boys move up first. Bad boys are like people with whom you can have a late night party, but you cannot make them your life partners.
So, the rerating has happened. Beaten down construction and infrastructure stocks have risen by four-five times, but I do not think wealth could have been made there. It is because had you bought some shares, you would have sold it at the first uptick or sold it up if it went up 50%.
So, overall we have to look for a trend in this market and I do not think this trend is going to come from the old leaders, which is the infrastructure and the real estate, because every bull market has its new leaders. Though it is a common cliche, but it has worked every time. Cement did well in 1992 and then cement did not do well for the next so many years. Software did well till 2000 and then it did not do well. 2003 was a time for Unitech and DLF and that is what happened.
So, this time the one trend which is already in vogue before this market started is the set of companies that cater to a consuming class, i.e. the semi-urban rural India.
Nikunj Dalmia: You are of the view that every bull market has a new leader. If I look at the leadership patterns right now they lie with IT, pharma and consumers. Do you think these three are the legs of this bull market?
Basant Maheshwari: IT is in a bullish phase, pharma could be a leader. Consumer is also very different. In consumer you have got the HULs and the Nestle.
Leadership will always come from a sector or from a set of companies that are growing at 30-35%-40%. In this market, there are 200 companies that can assure you of growing at 15%. Nobody cares about that.
There might be 50 companies that can assure you about 20-25% growth each CAGR for the next several years and people just get interested. Then there are a set of 10, 15, 20 companies that will grow at 30, 35, 40%. They are the real cheerleaders. The market will pay top dollar for them -- if not today, then tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then surely the day after.
So, the leadership will not come just because the prices are going up. It will also not come just because the dollar has appreciated and the rupee has depreciated. For one or two years, IT and pharma are doing well. The leadership will come from companies that can grow at 30-35% for the next 5-10 years. Even if they do not grow for 10 years, the market has to perceive that they will grow for 10 years and then they are going to put it on that valuation and that is what happens every time. First you underestimate growth, then you try to overestimate growth and that is when the bull market tanks off.
So my sense is anything relating to semi-urban and rural India will do tremendously well.
Nikunj Dalmia: Home financing business is the most stable sector in Indian markets per se. HDFC has been a mega wealth creator, Gruh Finance has done well, but some would argue that these stocks have already made mega wealth for investors. Will they continue to do that going forward?
Basant Maheshwari: There is a CRISIL study or it is an official study that India has a shortage of 6.3 crore homes. Out of that 80% pertains to rural India. You just see how many accounts they have. Look at Repco's loan book divided by the average ticket size, and you get about 50,000 accounts.
If you divide Gruh Finance loan book by the average ticket size, you get 1.2, 1.3, 1.5 lakh accounts. Put in Dewan Housing, the low income category you will see that the scale of opportunity is at least 50 to 100 times from here and by the time you go 50 times, the entire market will also expand. Their shortage will not remain at 6.3 crore homes. Also, there is a cultural shift happening in India. Two brothers do not have to fight always to create a new demand.
You are from Delhi, you came to Bombay, you bought a new home, took it on rent or did whatever. Thus, you created a demand. If your child goes to Bangalore tomorrow and says that I have got to study in Bangalore or I am going to work there, he creates a new demand. So, with education, literacy, with the growth of India as people get displaced, it is bad for the family but it is great for these financers.
Mortgage to GDP which we say is 8%-9%, is nothing in today's environment. We can easily go to 30% over the next 20 years. All you have to do is look for a company that does not lend to real estate developers or intermediaries that does not do a lot of loan against property.

Is Ebola the world s worst infectious disease threat since AIDSIs Ebola the world's worst infectious disease threat?
AP
New York/London, October 18, 2014
First Published: 23:10 IST(18/10/2014)

Comparisons between AIDS and Ebola, two deadly diseases, surfaced in the last few months as the Ebola outbreak escalated. Both emerged from Africa and erupted into an international health crisis. And both have been a shocking reminder that mankind's battle against infectious diseases can take a sudden, terrible turn for the worse.
In his three decades in public health, the only thing like Ebola has been the AIDS epidemic, said Dr Tom Frieden, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"And we have to work now so this is not the world's next AIDS," he told a meeting of the world's economic leaders in Washington last week.
But Ebola is not expected to ever be in the same league as AIDS in terms of infections and deaths, said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

"There is no one that imagines that we're going to see tens of millions of people infected with Ebola," said Fauci, a longtime leader in the fight against AIDS.
This year's Ebola outbreak - the largest ever - has killed more than 4,500 people in West Africa. AIDS kills more than a million per year on the continent.
Both diseases are caused by viruses and spread through contact with bodily fluids, not the air, but health experts say the epidemics are more different than they are similar.
Ebola can be more infectious than HIV, according to Dr Bruce Ribner, a physician involved in the care of four Ebola patients treated so far at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.
Indeed, a patient in the throes of Ebola can have 10 billion viral particles in a fifth of a teaspoon of blood - far more than the 50,000 to 100,000 particles seen in an untreated patient with the AIDS virus. Even the skin of an Ebola patient can be crawling with the virus, according to Ribner.
Still, there are reasons to be more optimistic about Ebola than about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Ebola was actually discovered before HIV. First identified in 1976 and named after a river in Congo, the virus has caused periodic outbreaks in Africa ever since. While a test was made to diagnose it, work on vaccines and treatments has been limited and difficult.
Ebola did not become an international epidemic until this year, when it unexpectedly mushroomed in West Africa. The rapid increase in cases - particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone - led to the CDC's worst-case-scenario estimate that there could be as many as 1.4 million cases in those two countries alone by January.
But at least scientists had a running start against Ebola.
The beginning of the AIDS epidemic was more challenging. When clusters of cases were first reported in 1981, health officials were facing a mysterious illness with no known cause.
"We didn't know it was a virus. We had no idea what was going on," recalled David Celentano, who was a young AIDS researcher in the 1980s and is now at Johns Hopkins University's school of public health.
Scientists did not isolate HIV until a couple of years later. A test for the virus wasn't available until 1985. There's still no vaccine, but medications have allowed those infected to live longer and healthier lives.
In those first few years, AIDS was generally perceived as occurring mainly in gay men, intravenous drug users and Haitians who had recently entered the United States.
"There was kind of a sense that 'it's only happening in certain places, and it only happens to certain people,'" said Dr Wafaa El-Sadr, a Columbia University professor who as a young physician treated AIDS patients in New York City.
It wasn't until the mid-1980s when public anxiety and fear about the disease in the US really began to reach the levels seen today with Ebola. In 1985, an Indiana school barred a boy with hemophilia named Ryan White because he was infected through a blood transfusion. Later that year, a national poll showed more than half of Americans favored the quarantining of AIDS patients and 15 percent supported tattooing people who had AIDS.
Beginning in 1987, HIV-positive travelers were banned from entering the country. The rule was changed in January 2010.

Public anxiety about Ebola took flight in the last month with the first case diagnosed in the U.S. in a man who traveled to Dallas from Liberia. In the Dallas area, attendance dropped at schools where children attended who had reportedly been in contact with the man, Thomas Eric Duncan. At the CDC, calls and emails to the federal health agency spiked to more than 800 from a few dozen daily asking questions about the disease.
This past week, screening of travelers from West Africa began at five US airports.
The international response also has been accelerated with Ebola, compared to AIDS. The United Nation's UNAIDS program didn't begin until 1995. Some experts feel real momentum in the international campaign didn't occur until 2000.
The Ebola response also has been faulted as dangerously slow, but it's been much faster than what happened with AIDS. In the last month - about six months after the epidemic in West Africa first began - officials from the United State and other nations have met to ratchet up an international response with money, troops and supplies.
There's one more big difference that ironically makes Ebola more dreadful to many people but possibly easier for health workers to one day beat back, said Dr. James Curran, dean of Emory University's school of public health.
The scariest thing about the Ebola virus is how quickly and dramatically it kills. Initial infection to ghastly death is only a matter of weeks.

That's different from HIV: An HIV-infected person may not have symptoms for years. And a decade may pass before an untreated AIDS victim dies. That means infected people can silently and unknowingly spread the infection for years.
HIV "is insidious," said Curran, who led the CDC's task force on AIDS in the mid-1980s.
Ebola's speed is more terrifying. But it also allows cases to be identified and isolated and contacts to be tracked down and monitored before they can continue to spread the disease.
"It potentially gives us a way to break the back of the epidemic," Curran said.
WHO won't discuss Ebola mistakes document
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Saturday that it wouldn't explain details contained in an internal document obtained by The Associated Press in which the UN health agency said it fumbled early attempts to contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
In the draft document, which wasn't released publicly, WHO blamed numerous factors for the now explosive Ebola epidemic, including incompetent staff, bureaucracy and a lack of reliable information.
"WHO will not do interviews or explain details on this document until it is completed," the health agency said in a statement Saturday. "WHO believes in transparency and accountability and will release this review when it is fact-checked."

Govt bungalows can no longer be memorialsGovt bungalows can no longer be memorials
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 19, 2014

Government bungalows in Delhi will not be allocated for memorials, the Union cabinet decided on Saturday, weeks after a controversy over RLD chief Ajit Singh’s demand for turning his official residence into a monument to his father.
 
The Lutyens’ Delhi house occupied by late Prime Minister Charan Singh was allotted to his son Ajit Singh after he became a minister during the UPA regime. When he lost this year’s Lok Sabha election and was asked to vacate the bungalow, Ajit Singh sought to turn it into a memorial.
 
The government, however, rejected the demand and cut power and water supply, forcing Singh to move out of the Tughlaq Road residence last month.
 
Sources said the cabinet’s decision was a reiteration of an NDA government resolution in 2000 that was violated by the UPA-2 regime when it allowed a memorial to late Bihar politician Babu Jagjivan Ram at the 6 Krishna Menon Marg bungalow.
 
The house was allotted to former speaker and Jagjivan Ram’s daughter, Meira Kumar.  
 
The Union urban development ministry, which moved the proposal, cited the acute shortage of government bungalows to push for the ban.
 
Five such bungalows have been turned into memorials to national leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.

In Delhi  cycling clubs pedal a silent revolutionIn Delhi, cycling clubs pedal a silent revolution

On a quiet Saturday morning, a group of cyclists wearing helmets, vests and biking shoes, are moving fast on their bicycles on the Delhi-Gurgaon road, their hips still, and their cadence steady.
The cyclists belong to the Gurgaon Fun Riders, one of the many cycling communities that have sprung up, creating a cycling sub-culture in the Capital.
Till a few years back, the city only had Delhi Cycling Club, today, however, there are almost a dozen cycling clubs and communities. Cyclesutra, Gurgaon Fun Riders, Noida Cycling Club, Delhi Cyclists, Cyclofit, Pedal Yatri, Team T-3, South West Riders and the North Delhi Riders are the better known ones. 
These groups started out with a few friends cycling together on weekends, but now their membership is growing rapidly: Cyclesutra has 3,000 members and Delhi Cyclists has over 5,000 people, including CEOs, lawyers, businessmen, homemakers, doctors, students, and photographers. They ride to myriad destinations — exploring lanes, bylanes, hills and villages on the fringes of Delhi and NCR. Some of the popular routes these cyclists take include, the Biodiversity Park in Gurgaon to Qutab Minar, CP to Civil Lines. Besides they also undertake off-the road trails through densely forested areas such as Manger in the Aravalis. There are also groups like Team T-3 which organize long journeys covering 200 to 1,200 km.

For Delhi’s bold new cyclists, cycling is not just about fitness, but also about fun, food and bonding. “Biking is about exploring new places, forging friendships and keeping fit. Unlike gyming, which many find boring, cycling is exciting and suits all age-groups,” says Ashish Nagpal, a co-founder of Cyclesutra. Members of Cyclesutra gather at Akshardham every weekend and cycle to pre-decided destinations such as India Gate, the Walled City and Hauz Khas.
“The idea is to combine fun and fitness. Unlike walking or running, cycling allows you to explore new places, meet new people. There is nothing like the joy of discovering a new trail,” says Gagandeep Singh Bhalla, founder member of the Gurgaon Fun Riders, who often head to the Gurgaon-Faridabad road, and on longer journeys to Greater Noida. The cycling communities in Delhi are well connected with each other, and often invite other clubs to ride with them.
With their membership growing fast, many of these clubs such as the Noida Cycling Club, which gets 50 new members every month, organises the beginner’s ride for newbies on Saturday. “Riding a bike is not as simple as it seems; we teach our new members the techniques of smooth peddling, gearing and braking,” says Aman Puri, a student and founder-member of the Noida Cycling Club, which has about 1,200 members.
Similarly, Delhi Cyclists founded by Gaurav Wadhwa, whose family owns one of the oldest cycle shops in Delhi, also organises an ‘induction ride’ on Wednesdays.
“People generally have no idea which bike suits them most or how to handle one. They generally buy mountain bikes which look macho with their heavy grooved tyres, but are unsuitable for roads. Wrong bikes and wrong peddling strokes means you lose power fast,” says Wadhwa, sitting in his shop, designing the route of the group’s upcoming event Diwali short ride to India Gate. On Sundays his group ‘Delhi Cyclists’ organises ‘Zippy’ rides for fast riders, covering about 150 km.
For Manas Arvind, who started Team T-3, cycling is more of a sport than a fitness regime. “The cycling movement is picking up globally. It will take over golf as a popular sport,” says Arvind, a Gurgaon-based businessman who has undertaken cycling journeys clocking over 1,000 km on his German Cube bike.
Members of the city’s biking communities own hybrid bikes worth Rs. 40,000 to 1 lakh, but there are many who own road bikes which cost Rs. 5 lakh from high-end brands such as Trek, Giant, and Scott. Many of these bikes are fitted with GPS devices and cyclo-computers which throw up metrics like altitude, speed, even heart rates. In the past couple of years, several shops selling such high-end cycles have come up in Delhi and are doing brisk business.
“The sales of high-end cycles have doubled in the past two years. We sell over a hundred bikes every month from the Gurgaon showroom alone,” says Rajesh Girdhar of Rajesh Cycling Trading Company, which has shops in Guragon, Noida and Ghaziabad. He also rents out high-end bikes for Rs. 300 a day for those learning to ride. “A lot of beginners rent bikes before they decide to buy one,” says Girdhar. Like Wadhwa, Girdhar too has started a cycling community — Cyclofit  — which he admits helps both his business and the cycling movement. “The sales of our high end cycles is growing at 40 percent a year. After Bangalore, Delhi-NCR is our fastest growing market,” says, Sandeep Kumar Sinha, country manager, sales and operations, Firefox.  
Cycling, however, is far from being a lifestyle choice for Delhiites. Cyclists are at the bottom of the city’s road system, and cycles continue to be a mode of transport for the poor.
According to a recent Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) report, Delhi tops in road accidents deaths in the country and is most unsafe for cyclists. On an average two cyclists die every week on Delhi roads.
“More than cycling tracks, we need a campaign to promote cycling. It is the fear of being hit by rash motorists that prevents people from using cycles,” says Nagpal, who often commutes from his home in Noida to his Gurgaon office on a cycle. “For traffic police, cyclists and pedestrians just do not exist. A cyclist should have a right of way on the city roads,” says Arvind.

Gunpowder whiff to give way to aromatic plants in J-KComments
Scientists from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) might soon help farmers from a small border district in Kathua in Jammu — which has been grappling with cross-border firing lately — take up the cultivation of aromatic plants that can be exported.
The Jammu Kashmir Arogya Gram Yojana — launched by the science and technology minister  Jitendra Singh on Saturday has been designed to benefit farmers from far-flung areas, who have land holdings in terrains where the yield of traditionally-grown crops is disproportionately low. Land with the potential for growing aromatic plants will be identified and CSIR scientists and aroma experts will educate and train local farmers to take up this cultivation. The government will initially spend over Rs. 25 crores on this scheme.
Saplings will be provided by IIIM Jammu and scientific guidance will be rendered by a team of experts from five different CSIR labs. Some plants selected for this project include lemon grass (Cymbopogon), rose (Rosa), mint (Mentha), Ashwagandha (Withaniasomnifera) and Phalsa fruit plant. “We will start this programme from Jammu and then move on to other states. To begin with 1,000 villages of Jammu will be covered under this scheme. The process for identifying the villages has begun,” Singh said.
Maintaining that net profit for the farmers will be Rs. 1-1.5 lakh per annum per hectare (2.4 acre) he said, “Besides enabling the farmers to make a significant contribution to nation’s aromatic produce, it will also help generate economy for them.”

Exec sedans: Rs 11-19L price segment but few...Tweet
In the past two financial years, India’s passenger vehicle sales have been on skid row, with sales dropping in virtually every segment
In the past two financial years, India's passenger vehicle sales have been on skid row, with sales dropping in virtually every segment. But one that took a particularly bad beating is the executive sedan segment — defined as five-seater sedans that are 4,700-5,000 mm in length and in the Rs 11-19-lakh price band.
From peak unit sales of 47,991 in 2010, sales of cars in this segment — which include Fiat's Linea, GM's Optra and Cruze, Hyundai's Elantra, Renault's Fluence, Skoda's Laura and Octavia, Toyota's Corolla and Volkswagen's Jetta — contracted to almost a third to 17,073 in 2013. The entire passenger vehicles market in contrast grew by 7.46% in this period.
And although the car market has seen a smart comeback — sales of passengers vehicles between April and September are up 4.25% from the year-ago period — the executive sedan slice of the pie is not keeping pace. "I don't see a revival in this segment in the near future," says Deepesh Rathore, cofounder of Emmaaa, an auto consultancy.
According to data from industry body Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), between April and September, domestic sales in the segment cumulatively stood at 10,151. In September, sales were a paltry 1,850, over a third of those coming from the new Toyota Corolla. Honda, once a dominant player in the segment, pulled the plug on Civic in 2012. Just seven out of the 12 car manufacturers in the country today have a presence in this segment. "We have no plans to get into the Civic segment. We had seen the squeeze coming sometime back and we had to prioritize our investments," says Gnaneswar Sen, senior V-P (sales and marketing), Honda Cars India Ltd.
There are two important reasons why the decline in this segment deserves attention. One, globally this segment holds enormous significance for auto MNCs across the board as this is the entry-level segment in big car markets like the US. In fact, Corolla has long been one of the top-selling models. Two, while the dip in this segment mirrors sluggish sales in the industry, it also reflects some broader changes that have been happening as far as consumers and the industry are concerned.
Identity Crisis
"This segment has fallen between two stools," says Homrazd Sorabjee , editor, Autocar India. The lower-level C-segment sedans (Honda City, Ford Fiesta, Nissan Sunny, among others) have increasingly upgraded themselves, offering 90% of what executive sedans offer at 70% of the price, adds a senior auto industry executive who did not want to be named. For example, the fourth-generation City — launched in January and starting at Rs 7.42 lakh for the petrol version (ex-showroom Delhi) — is plush, spacious and feature rich. Before that in 2011, Hyundai launched Verna, which, besides its fluidic design, was the first to offer an automatic diesel engine in this segment.
With the C-segment offering nearly the same as executive sedans, status-conscious buyers began looking for more luxury and premiumness. Examples: the Accord and Camry. Or, even beyond, to the luxury car makers such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes, which had lowered the entry threshold. For example, Audi will soon launch A3 sedans in the Rs 22-27-lakh bracket. These shifts are best exemplified by the strategy of Honda, which phased out the Civic to focus on segments below (the City) and above (the Accord) the executive sedans.
Changing Tastes
Almost around the same time, Indian car buyers began to develop a taste for sports utility vehicles (SUVs), which as a segment has grown rapidly — from 3.67 lakh units in 2011-12 to 5.25 lakh units in 2013-14. Today, it comprises a little over a fifth of the passenger vehicle industry, and there are 42 SUV models competing in the market. "At that price [of an executive sedan], customers are exploring different body styles in the MPV [multi-purpose vehicle] and SUV segment," says Sorabjee.
So, does the executive sedan segment have a future? Experts think so. "The decline [in the segment] has bottomed out," adds Sorabjee. As consumer demand picks up and the passenger car market matures in India, niches like executive sedans will start to gain traction. And experts expect more launches in this segment.
"Value addition and new launches in this segment were limited. I think that will change," says N Raja, senior V-P (sales and marketing), Toyota Kirloskar Motors. Already, with the launch of the new Corolla earlier this year, Toyota has seen its sales improve. Corolla's monthly sales have moved up from an average of 300 before the relaunch to 791 now. "We have a two-month waiting period. I expect our monthly sales to go up to 1,000 units soon," adds Raja.
On the supply side, there are multiple reasons why auto companies will continue to have a presence in this segment. One, this is the entry-level segment in mature markets like the US. Almost every MNC — from Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, VW to Ford and GM — has a strong model presence in this segment. Says Rakesh Srivastava, senior V-P (sales and marketing), Hyundai Motors India: "We are a strong player in this segment. And we have the models and the technology to maintain our strong presence." Also, for most auto companies, the presence in this segment does not require too much investment or attention. With the indigenization level typically around 60% in these models, costs and resources required to sustain a presence is low. So, while sales have petered out, it may still be early days to etch the epitaph of the executive sedan.

Rummy a card game or a criminal offence: SC ...(Perhaps the most anxious…)
By: Sajai Singh & Yajas Setlur
Nearly 50 years after its landmark decision in the State of Andhra Pradesh vs Sathyanarayana Case, the Supreme Court is again faced with a dilemma regarding the card game of rummy in India. The Supreme Court has begun to hear an appeal by the Mahalakshmi Cultural Association (MCA), against which the Madras High Court made an adverse ruling in 2012.
The High Court held that playing rummy for stakes or any sort of wager would be a criminal offence under the Madras Police Act, 1888 ('Act'), the provisions of which are connected with most other state gaming laws in India.
In the Sathyanarayana case, the Supreme Court ruled that rummy involved a substantial amount of skill and therefore could not be termed gambling. In its concluding paragraphs, however, the court observed that if the game was played for stakes, the offence of gambling would be established. It was on the basis of this observation that the Madras High Court ruled against the MCA.
The concept of 'game of skill' is the determining factor in almost all gaming and gambling statutes in India, including the Madras Police Act, 1888. Section 49 of the Act exempts penal provisions against 'games of mere skill'.
The appellants and a host of online rummy companies are hoping to use this exemption, coupled with the aforementioned findings in the Sathyanarayana case, to convince the Supreme Court, that rummy, with or without stakes, should be exempt from gaming statutes and be deemed legal. The appellants contend that if a game is based on skills when played without stakes, such nature cannot change merely because money is wagered.
A Grey Area
The respondent, the state of Tamil Nadu, however, relies on the definition of 'Gaming' under the Act, which includes betting or wagering of any kind, and therefore contends that despite the exemption under Section 49 of the Act, betting or wagering on a game, even on one of skill, is indeed 'gaming' and therefore illegal (the terms 'Gaming' and 'Gambling' have been used interchangeably in this column).
This case is the culmination of years of contradicting High Court opinions on the subject and is awaited by state governments and stakeholders in the multibillion-dollar Indian gambling industry as it could potentially seal the fate of gambling in India. A decision of the court in favour of the appellants would open the floodgates to not only traditional brick-and mortar gaming establishments, but also to rummy websites, which have so far had an ambiguous legal existence.
Indeed, it would vindicate several of the appellants who are already offering online rummy for a fee. Such a judgement would also vindicate the judgements of the Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh High Courts, which have permitted skillbased card games with stakes. A positive verdict will set off other far-reaching events. More stakeholders will be encouraged to contend that similar skill-based card games such as poker should also be allowed to be played for stakes. The legality of poker in India has been a hotly debated matter in recent times.
The Karnataka High Court in 2013 unambiguously recognised poker as a game of skill, but several other high courts have (indirectly, while referring to the 'three card game') found poker to be a game of pure chance and hence, illegal. An appeal filed by Gaussian Networks is pending before the Delhi High Court on this exact point, and a judgement by the Supreme Court on rummy is bound to influence the high court's verdict.
  Even more crucially, such a judgement may pave the way for legalised betting on sports in India such as cricket and football, which are indisputable games of skill. So far, in what many believe to be an arbitrary distinction, betting has been legalised only on horse races among sports. The flip side is that allowing wagering in rummy may indirectly allow betting on the outcome of a sporting event.
The FDI Card
Perhaps, the most interested and anxious observers of this case are foreign gaming companies that have been trying for years to enter the lucrative Indian market.
A favourable decision (rummy is not gambling) will mean that the prevailing FDI policy, which prohibits all forms of investment in the gambling and lottery sectors, will not apply to rummy operations. That will be an impetus to the growth and influence of several offshore online betting companies such as bet365 in India — these companies already have millions of loyal Indian customers.
Even if the judgement were to favour the gaming industry, it may still not be a cakewalk — states are likely to amend gaming statutes in response. Odisha and Assam, for example, already have gaming laws that criminalise wagering on games of skill and chance alike. It is likely that other states will follow suit and plug the loophole of 'skill' in their gambling regulations.
Just as a decision in favour of the appellants will be an undoubted boost for gaming, a decision against them would spell its doom in India. The respondents have urged the court to consider the matter in a holistic manner, taking into account that 'gambling dens', including those operated by the MCA, often offer intoxicants to their members and plunge them into gambling addictions and deep and unsupportable debt.
It remains to be seen whether the court will decide this crucial case from a strictly legal perspective, based on the skill/chance component of rummy and the effect of adding stakes thereto, or on the social and economic repercussions of wagering. Either way, the judgement will have a considerable influence on the future of all forms of gambling in India.

Delhi: One N-E person targeted every alternate dayOne person from the Northeast faces harassment in the Capital every alternate day, statistics by Delhi Police show.
 
The study of the pattern of crimes against the community living in Delhi also shows that South Delhi is the most unsafe area for Northeasterns and Munirka as the most unsafe residential colony.
Over 25 ‘serious’ crime cases against people from the Northeast were reported from Munirka this year (till October 15). The figure for the corresponding period last year was just three. 
In south Delhi, over 70 cases have been registered — 60% of the total cases against Northeasterns reported from across the Capital in the past ten months. The total number of such cases stood at 125. 
Other areas from where such crimes were reported frequently are: Malviya Nagar, Kotla Mubarakpur, Vasant Kunj, South Campus and Hauz Khas. 
Community leaders believe the rising crime graph against their people underscores the failure of Delhi Police as a force and their several initiatives which had
been launched specifically to protect people belonging to the Northeast.
“The statistics prove beyond doubt that not only the crimes against people from N-E are rising. But, also the police are least concerned about the safety of people living in these vulnerable areas. Creating a N-E Cell or starting a helpline number wouldn’t solve the problem. The police personnel need to be more
vigilant and proactive. Otherwise, their tall claims of being sensitive towards crime against Northeastern people will fall flat,” said Chinglen Khumukcham of the North East Forum for International Solidarity (NEFIS).
Asked for a comment, a senior police officer said, “Several steps have been taken to curb such crimes. The rise in number of cases also signifies the fact that no such incident is being ignored — neither by the people, nor by the police. We have been holding meetings with representatives of Northeastern people in Delhi and making them aware about the steps Delhi Police has taken for their security.”

India may benefit from a legalized gambling ...India may be poised to benefit from a broadly legalized gambling market

Andyz Fish & Chips
(Around $60 billion is spent…)
On a Thursday evening, as the peak-hour traffic begins to build in east Bangalore, a group of 20-something friends enter a three-storey commercial complex on the periphery of Indiranagar, a posh residential suburb.
The ground floor of this building houses a popular vegetarian restaurant, frequented by large families. This group, though, has no interest in a leisurely meal. Instead, they are headed three floors up to Andyz Fish & Chips, one of a dozen new poker rooms that have mushroomed across India's IT Capital.
Riding on a Karnataka High Court judgment a year ago that declare d poker as a predominant game of skill and not one of chance, these entrepreneurs have set up these rooms across the length and breadth of the city, attracting dozens of youth who have familiarized themselves with the game online.
A few months later, it was the turn of a court to give rummy a stamp of legality — in a judgment, the Karnataka High Court quashed charges against 19 persons who were arrested on charges of gambling for playing rummy. Like in the case of poker, the court reckoned that rummy too was a game of skill, not chance.
Fish & Chips
There's no board to direct you to Andyz, which sounds more like a restaurant but for those who play the game, both 'fish' and 'chips' are poker-speak — the former for a novice and the latter are the tokens that masquerade as money.
As the rest of the city makes its way home at around 7.30 pm, two tables are well into their games of poker. Andyz has half a dozen tables (including one for VIP members with cushioned leather chairs in a room) and, on weekends, you can expect at least five of them to be busy. "Everyone who comes here has tried online poker first, but now wants a taste of the real thing," says Andy Morgan, co - founder of the club. "We have 300 members and we're adding to this list daily."
Over the past couple of years, India's legal system — state by state — has been opening up to the possibilities of more legitimate avenues for gambling. For example, in September this year, the Supreme Court sought the Union government's thoughts on viewing online rummy as a game of skill — and therefore a more legal operation — rather than a decidedly illegal game of chance.
Elsewhere, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh ruled that poker for stakes was a game of skill and therefore kosher. Sikkim runs an online and legal lottery system. Most visibly, lakhs of rupees are bet legally on horse races daily across India.
This interest is hardly a shock for regular punters, who have for decades been trying their hands at games of skill and chance. Every year, around Diwali, these games peak, as people flock to house parties for an assortment of card games, with money wagered between friends and family informally.
  Time to Take a Chance
If the popularity of poker clubs in Bangalore is any indication, then India may be ideally poised to benefit from a more broadly legalized gambling market, backed with stringent law enforcement (with the creation of gaming commissions as in the UK) and the opportunity to funnel crores of rupees from underground networks.
According to regulars, there is still a very limited opportunity in India to gamble legally for players who have honed their skills online and want to make a splash in the real world.
Some do try their hand at casinos in Goa and Sikkim, but many prefer to hit the gaming houses in Bangkok, Singapore (with just two large legally sanctioned casinos in Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa) or the Monte Carlo of the Orient — Macau.
The erstwhile Portuguese colony generated $45 billion in gambling revenues in 2013, barely a decade after making a concerted push into the market (although the Portuguese had legalized gambling way back in the 1850s).
Macau's meteoric rise has left old favourites in the US, Las Vegas and Atlantic City behind. As the legal tide turns, regular players hope that India can slowly unshackle itself from the past and emerge as an alternative destination for gambling.
The first signs of this movement are already visible — thanks to the internet, thousands of players between 18 and 40 years are well versed in games such as poker and rummy both online and offline — while legalization is prompting the establishment of new clubs.
"There's plenty of interest and excitement around these games and a stronger legal framework will only push more people to consider legal avenues," says Morgan of Andyz. The Karnataka High Court's ruling a year ago gave the gambling market a big fillip, prompting the setting up of a raft of new clubs. "This is an entirely legal operation," says KN Suresh, about the Indian Poker Association (IPA), of which he is the secretary and co-founder.

JOB CHANGE
(The role of a recruitment…)
Thinking of changing jobs and not getting enough opportunities through the usual friend, acquaintance, ex-colleague and social media channels? Tapping a placement firm or headhunter could be a good bet. ET shows you how to do it in the most effective way.
1. Make a Custom Choice
The role of a recruitment consultant is to facilitate the best possible match between a candidate and a potential employer. "A specialist recruitment firm works towards ensuring that you find the right fit within your discipline of choice as compared to a general recruitment consultancy," says Nilay Khandelwal, director of recruitment consultancy Michael Page India . Agrees Kunal Sen, senior VP, TeamLease Services . "Research and approach placement firms that work in the sectors which match the skills and experience you have to offer. Connect with the right sectoral people within the firm," suggests Sen.
2. Recreate Yourself
A one-size-fits-all CV does not work. "Make the recruiter's job easy by showing a clear match between your skills and the job requirements in your resume. Clearly demonstrate how you meet the key skills sets, experience and attributes the employer is looking for. Emphasise your most relevant strengths and eliminate the details unrelated to the position," says Khandelwal.
3. Make a Good First Impression
Your first interview with the recruiter can make or break your job search, say headhunters. It is crucial that you dress the part and make a lasting impression. "Top-of-mind recall is vital in the recruitment industry and you want to ensure you make your mark," says Khandelwal.
4. Ask Plenty of Questions
Use the opportunity to ask maximum questions about the opportunities in the sector, says TeamLease's Kunal Sen. These could include ones about the overall employment outlook for the sector, what major companies in the sector the firm works with, what specific roles it is working on, if someone of his or her skills and experience is of interest to the firm or its clients and what steps one should take. "Importantly, do not look or sound desperate," cautions Sen.
5. Be Honest
"A falsified profile can be easily spotted by a recruiter. Avoid duplication of effort and losing face with your recruiter by honestly representing yourself in the first meeting," says Khandelwal. "Be clear on your availability with respect to location, work hours, travel etc," says Sen.

Devendra Fadnavis leads BJP's Maharashtra Chief Ministerial race

(Sources say Fadnavis –…)
MUMBAI: Squeaky clean image, his willingness to put in 15-hour work days and the skill to steer clear of controversies may have made 44-year-old Devendra Fadnavis the BJP's chief ministerial choice in Maharashtra, according to highly-placed party sources.
Sure, a lot hinges upon the numbers that Sunday will throw up, but insiders say that by voting for Fadnavis, a Brahmin, BJP would also be signaling that it is no longer anxious of being projected as "Shetji-Bhatji" party. Caste plays a huge factor in Maharashtra politics with most of the CMs hailing from the powerful Maratha community . There has only been one Brahmin CM till date, Manohar Joshi.
Incidentally, the Shiv Sena leader ascended to Mantralaya the only time the saffron combine came to power. At that time, the caste calculus was maintained by BJP when it made Gopinath Munde the Deputy CM. Earlier reports pitched the late Munde's daughter Pankaja as a dark horse for the top job, but sources say Fadnavis - considered very close to RSS - seems to have made the cut because of a combination of factors.
But if BJP falls short of numbers and it has to approach the Sena, then the latter could insist Pankaja be made the CM, said Yuvraj Mohite, a political analyst. On Friday, while speaking to reporters at her home in Worli in Mumbai, Pankaja said that she is willing to approach the Sena for support if the party falls short of numbers.
She also told a TV channel that 'those who wanted my father to be the CM and the youth of the state' want her to become the CM. "Her statements have taken a not so subtle change ever since the campaigning began. She is slowly showing her hand," said Mohite.
Political analyst Kumar Ketkar felt that the BJP may not face any immediate problem in having Fadnavis as the CM. "However the reverberations would be felt at the local level from Maratha groups like the Sambhaji Brigade and Chava Sanghatana," he told ET. Fadnavis also belongs to the Vidarbha region where the party sought votes on the issue of giving a separate statehood to the region if voted to power.
"If Fadnavis is made CM, then we don't need to go for creating a separate state as the main reason for the demand of creating a separate state of Vidarbha is lack of development," said a BJP leader.

(The Shiv Sena took a…)
MUMBAI: After constantly targeting the BJP over the split in the saffron alliance and even criticising PM Narendra Modi in harsh language, the Shiv Sena took a softer line towards the BJP on Friday and talked of some possibility of reconciliation with the former alliance partner.
"Maharashtra needs stability and peace and for that some compromises may have to be reached. Let us see what numbers come out on Sunday," Sena mouthpiece Saamna said on Friday. The numbers reflected in most exit poll surveys in Maharashtra predict that the BJP will be the largest single party in the state assembly and will be in striking distance of establishing a complete majority in the house.
The BJP has been giving indications that it might take along some independent MLAs and smaller parties but would not be approaching the Sena for help in forming the government. On this backdrop the Sena came out softer and exhibited a mood of reconciliation with its former alliance partner. "Everybody is hurt. Alliance is split, minds have split but Maharashtra needs stability. There should be no bitterness now and no disputes. What happened was the past. We have to face the future and work for Maharashtra," said the Sena editorial.
Political observers also believe that the Sena has come to terms with the prediction made in the exit polls and wants to now reconcile. "I think the exit polls have created a deep impression on the Sena. They don't want to be politically orphaned. They were looking at an option of going with the NCP but exit polls show that NCP is is going to become irrelevant in Maharashtra after the results come out. The only option Sena has is to go with the BJP and be part of the government," said analyst Kumar Ketkar.
"Its an indication that the Sena to some extent may have accepted the conclusion drawn in the exit polls of various agencies that the BJP will emerge as the single largest party and may get over 120-125 seats in the assembly. In such a case the BJP will need only 20-25 seats more to establish a clear majority. The Sena has been a partners for a long time and will offer support so that a stable government can be established by the saffron alliance," said a Lok Sabha MP of the Shiv Sena.
The smaller alliance partners of BJP such as RPI's Ramdas Athawale and Shiv Sangram Party's Vinayak Mete said on Thursday that they would be happy if the Sena and BJP come together again and form a majority government in the state which will be stable.
"We expect that the Sena will come around. After all it has been with the BJP for 25 years. Now after 15 years, there is an opportunity in the state to form the government. We will be happy if both parties can join hands and give a stable and solid government of which we will also be a part," said MLC Vinayak Mete.

(Petrol prices are at a 16-month…)
Global commodities have tumbled in recent months, ending an extended bull run that had hurt India by widening the current account and fiscal deficits, besides raising subsidies and weakening the rupee . All this is now reversing. Petrol prices are at a 16-month low, cooking oil and rubber are at a five-year low. Sugar and cotton are also down. This augurs well for a lower rate of inflation .
Why is oil falling?
Supply has increased substantially while demand outlook is weak
US shale output has risen significantly
OPEC shows no signs of cutting output
Saudi Arabia not willing to bear burden. It increased Sep output 0.5% to 9.65 million barrels per day
IEA has cut global energy demand forecast four months in a row
IMF has scaled down the outlook for global economic growth
Has oil bottomed out?
Bank of America and BNP Paribas SA say prices to hold above $80 a barrel
Analysts divided, but oil rose to $87 on Friday
Oil below $80 can make some shale fields unviable
Saudi Arabia may let oil fall to keep some suppliers out
Oil likely to fall further if OPEC does not cut supply
OPEC supplies only 40% of global oil.
What can make oil rise again?
Revival in economic growth in Europe and Asia Any output cut by OPEC Turmoil in the Middle East spikes to disrupt supply
Does oil affect other commodities?
Impacts Sugar. More cane is used for sugar, as ethanol unattractive at low oil prices

Nirmala Sitharaman asks tea producing states to pay minimum wages to tea workers

(Nirmala Sitharaman was…)
GUWAHATI: Union minister of state for commerce and industry, Nirmala Sitharaman has asked the states to pay notified minimum wages. The commerce ministry has announced that Centre will duck tail various flagships schemes of the Government of India in the tea garden areas.
Sitharaman was in Guwahati on Monday to participate in the stakeholders' meeting of the tea industry . This is widely seen as BJP preparation for the 2016 assembly polls in Assam and West Bengal where tea workers have a crucial vote.
Planters fear that paying higher wages will escalate the cost of production. Sitharam who was in her maiden visit to Guwahati after assuming the charge of ministry said that it was pointed out during the meeting from the some quarters that notified minimum wages are not paid in Assam.
In two tea producing areas of Brahmaputra Valley and Barak workers per day get Rs 95 and Rs 75 respectively while the notified minimum wage is Rs 184. There other benefits like rationing; housing which according to tea planters comes to around Rs 100 per day.
However according to commerce ministry the two components, cash and benefits are different and cannot be clubbed together as minimum wage. In Assam which roughly accounts for over 50 percent of India tea wages are fixed bilaterally by the unions and tea planters' body.
However Sitharaman's comment has come at a time when the wage revision is due for December this year. In West Bengal workers gets Rs 97. In Tamil Nadu the Rs. 206.22 is declared minimum wages. In Kerala Rs. 222.97 is the wages. In Karnataka Rs. 228.35 is the minimum wage declared by the Government.
The minister said that benefits given to tea workers are added in cash components by tea planters. "We have asked the Assam government to look into the issue and similarly we will take up with other governments. Tea union in West Bengal had five round of discussion with the state government. Non cash component interpreted by different people differently is unwarranted."
She said that the minimum wages must be implemented in correct way. "We will duck tail some of the government of India flagship schemes in the tea garden areas. These schemes pertaining to drinking water, sanitation, health, nutrition and housing will add to the social benefit."
North Eastern Tea Association (NETA) Chairman, Bidyananda Barkakoty told ET, "Any increase in the wages will increase the cost of production. The tea prices therefore have to go up to make the operations viable. Social benefits come at a cost so we have account the same with the wages paid. The productivity of workers here is much less than workers of South India."
In Trinamool ruled West Bengal, there are over 3.5 lakh tea workers whereas in congress ruled Assam there is over 11 lakh tea workers. Political analysts see this as the saffron party's attempt to get closer to tea workers prior to assembly polls of 2016.

Combating Ebola: India should tighten border vigilAjit Seth
(So far, nearly 9,000 cases…)
Peter Piot, one of the scientists who discovered Ebola over three-and-a-half decades ago and named it after an African river, dreads to think what may happen if the virus sneaks into India and the infected individual visits a public hospital. The thought popped into Piot's mind when he was asked by 'The Guardian' in October whether the spread of the virus is beginning to snowball into a pandemic.
"Doctors and nurses in India, too, often don't wear protective gloves. They would immediately become infected and spread the virus," he said. His observation on India's public health system is widely shared. Healthcare providers, doctors and public health activists that ET spoke to feel that although India falls in the low-risk zone, it would be lucky to escape the deadly virus, which has killed about half of those infected.
"Fortunately, India is not a reservoir of the infection which means that the virus till now doesn't have a known origin here. So if it enters, it will have to be an import from abroad. This calls for stringent screening at airports and ports, and monitoring those suspected carriers of the infection very closely," said NarendraSaini, general secretary of the Indian Medical Association and an expert on infection control.
How ready is India? The government may ask airlines to chip in and screen passengers from the time of boarding. All passengers from West African countries are already screened for symptoms on arrival, mainly for body temperature deviations, travel history and a followup medical examination if necessary. According to the government, there are about 4,700 Indians in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, three countries in the eye of the Ebola storm.
On Thursday, at a meeting convened by cabinet secretary Ajit Seth , the civil aviation ministry representative was asked to check with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation about a proposal to seek the participation of airlines in screening passengers for Ebola symptoms. International airports, which receive indirect flights from Ebola-affected countries, have been or are being equipped with thermal scanners to record passengers' temperatures. Government officials confirmed to ET that thermal guns are being procured for more robust screening.
Thermal guns, used in some US airports, are hand-held devices that can measure temperature without body contact. Till date, about 22,150 passengers have been screened. Over 1,000 were identified as suspected cases and 63 were clubbed in the high- or medium-risk category.
While low-risk passengers are given general advice on the virus, medium to high-risk passengers are quarantined, kept under observation for 30 days and their blood samples tested. None of the samples has tested positive in India, according to official records. The capacity to test samples is being expanded.
"We have two labs - Pune-based National Institute of Virology and Delhi-based National Centre for Diseases Control - with a capacity to test 100 samples each per day and are working on getting another 10 labs ready to scale up capacity," said Anshu Prakash, joint secretary, health ministry. Each state has identified at least one hospital to deal with Ebola infection and has set up isolation centres or wards there.
The centre is distributing about 50,000 protective gear kits to states and has asked them to procure more. A round-the-clock emergency helpline has been set up in the health ministry to address queries about the infection. Mock drills and workshops are being planned and held by the health ministry and the IMA to train doctors and frontline health workers. A module on information and protocols on how to handle suspected cases has also been sent out, said Saini of IMA, which has 29 state-level branches and 1,700 local-level branches.
But is that enough? "Despite a robust screening system, even the US couldn't stop the infection from entering. There is only so much you can do to screen infection carriers and no such system can be fool-proof," said a public health activist from a global NGO. The infection spreads through contact and India's dense population and crowded localities render it particularly vulnerable if the virus enters the country, Saini said.
"We have not inculcated habits of hand washing which poses another challenge because it spreads through contact," Saini said, adding rituals such as bathing the bodies of victims and carrying them on shoulders can also pose risks.
"About 70 per cent of patient load is handled by the private healthcare system and chances of those infected turning up at a private hospital are very high. Besides asking them to refer patients to public hospitals, the government needs to ensure that private hospitals are equipped and participate more fully in the country's preparedness," Saini said. If the Ebola attack does land up on Indian shores, our people (doctors and healthcare workers) will not fail us, our infrastructure may, he said.

All airports have equipment to detect Ebola: Govt tells High CourtAll airports have equipment to detect Ebola: Government tells High Court
PTI Oct 16, 2014, 05.34PM IST
(In the event of any passenger…)
MUMBAI: The Union government has informed the Bombay High Court that all international airports in the country have been provided with thermal image scanners to detect the presence of 'Ebola' virus among passengers coming from African countries.
All the airports, including Pune and Nagpur airports where international flights land, have been provided with scanners to screen passengers for a possible Ebola infection, government counsel Rui Rodriges told the court on October 14.
Taking his statement on record, a bench headed by Justice Abhay Oka disposed of a Public Interest Litigation filed by activist Ketan Tirodkar alleging that India was not fully equipped to prevent the spread of the dreaded Ebola.
Dr V L Gokak, Senior Regional Director, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, submitted a compliance report to the court assuring that all the international airports in India are fully equipped to detect Ebola virus among passengers who come from African countries.
In the event of any passenger carrying Ebola virus is detected, such a person would be quarantined in a hospital, the government told the court.
In September, the court had asked Maharashtra government to provide medical screening facilities at Pune and Nagpur airports, on the lines of such facilities in Mumbai and Delhi.
The state government had said in an affidavit that the Centre had not provided scanners for Nagpur and Pune. The High Court then asked the Centre to provide the equipment as soon as possible.
The Central government counsel said that "adequate" screening measures were in place at ports and airports.
Tirodkar's PIL alleged that several Indians or NRIs in Africa were returning due to the outbreak of Ebola in the continent, but there are no facilities either to detect or treat the epidemic in India.

Ebola vaccine not before late 2016: GSK researcherGSK's is one of 2 vaccines along with one by US group NewLink Genetics that the WHO has been focusing on and it has helped accelerate clinical trials.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: An Ebola vaccine by British pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline may not be ready for commercial use until late 2016 and should therefore not be seen as the "primary answer" to the current outbreak, a company researcher said.
"We have to be able to manufacture the vaccine at doses that would be consistent with general use and that's going to take well into 2016," Doctor Ripley Ballou, head of GSK's Ebola vaccine research unit, told BBC radio in an interview aired on Friday.
"I don't think this vaccine should be seen as the primary answer to this particular outbreak but we certainly hope that this vaccine could be used to prevent future outbreaks.
"Unfortunately it's not going to be as quickly as we would like," he said, adding: "In retrospect we should have pulled the trigger earlier."
Ballou said data on the vaccine's efficacy and safety would not be available before the end of 2015.
"In order for the vaccine to be used we have to have data on its safety and its efficacy and those data will not be available before the end of 2015," he said.
He added that the whole process was "incredibly accelerated" as vaccine development would normally take seven to 10 years.
GSK's is one of two vaccines along with one by US group NewLink Genetics that the World Health Organization has been focusing on and it has helped accelerate clinical trials.
Some clinical trials of the GSK vaccine have begun in the United States and Britain and the WHO has said that around 10,000 doses of the vaccine should be available by early 2015.

Despite low inflation  why economy is not out of the woodsYou are here: Home > Collections
Inflation is down & crude prices have fallen sharply, but the economy is not out of woods. Why?

Consumer Price Inflation
(Nitsure points out there…)
With both retail and wholesale prices dropping sharply in the recent months, anticipation is higher than ever of that long-awaited event — a cut in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
Consumer price inflation is currently at about 6.5%, seemingly within the comfort zone for the RBI's target of getting prices down to 8% by January. Many analysts, though, see little hope of a rate cut at any point in the next few months at least.
"The RBI has been fighting a fiveyear battle with inflation," says Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist with the Bank of Baroda. "That battle is not going to end that easily."
To be sure, as Nitsure points out, there are good reasons to believe that the decline in inflation in the past couple of months may be purely an artefact of the numbers.
Inflation between September and November last year rose by over two percentage points to close to 12%. Because of this high 'base effect', as statisticians call it, part of the drop in recent months was only to be expected.
"The inflation rate for November will see the lowest number in five years," says Nitsure. "But expect inflation to rise after that."
The RBI is likely to wait and watch for a few months on whether inflation is coming down and will stay low before finally taking a call on interest rates.
India Impact
But there are other concerns as well. The global economy is weak, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its latest global growth forecasts. The notable exception here is the US, which has seen improved growth in recent months with the US unemployment rate falling to 6.1% in August, a level not seen since 2008.
This would normally be seen as a good thing, but markets also take it as a sign that growth increases the risk of inflation rising well above what the US central bank would see as comfortable, forcing it to raise interest rates. "In fact, that's a key risk right now," says economist Abheek Barua, currently with think tank ICRIER.
Analysts see a possible rate hike by the Federal Reserve by the second or third quarter of 2015.
But why should that matter to the Indian economy? A hike in US interest rates, or even the mere expectation among investors, has led to outflows of foreign investor money from emerging markets back to the US. This has happened with little regard to the state of individual markets at that time.
 
"India may do a bit better relative to other Asian markets, but we are still quite vulnerable," says Barua. Even the other big positive for the Indian economy in recent months — the sharp fall in crude oil prices — takes on a more ominous tone when seen in this light.
The decline in prices of crude and other commodities may be just the first signs of this 'capital flight' back to the US, though other factors such as the weakness in key economies of Europe and China have certainly played a role. "The question could well be as to which market is next," says Barua.
Even weak global commodity prices in themselves have an ambiguous effect on the Indian economy. It's good for consumers, but not so good for farmers who can expect relatively meagre earnings across a range of key crops as global prices remain soft. That hurts the earnings of around half the workforce who earn a living from agriculture, and therefore the rural economy.
Structural Issues
An outflow of portfolio capital from the Indian markets would inevitably be seen as having a negative impact on the rupee. Indeed, in real terms, when the differences in inflation rates between India and the rest of the world are taken into account, the rupee is seen as 'overvalued' against key currencies and ripe for a fall. If this does happen, the sharp fall in the price at which India buys crude oil (currently at around $87 per barrel) would be offset partly by a weaker exchange rate.
These 'macro' risks are quite apart from the broader structural issues with the Indian economy, which the new government has only begun to address. As Nitsure points out, apart from industrial growth, bank credit too remains very weak. "Though the government has been active in clearing stalled projects, corporates are still in a wait-and-watch mode," she says. The fall in inflation is a good sign, but the economy is hardly in the clear.

NEW DELHI: Government has received 72 proposals from various companies including Adani Group, ITC and Future Group for 17 food parks to be approved in the next two-three months.
Under the scheme (2008-09) of mega food parks, the Food Processing Ministry had sanctioned 42 projects throughout the country. Of this, 25 projects are presently under implementation in various states.
"We have received 72 proposals including from big players like Adani, ITC and Future Group for the 17 food parks to be approved by the government in next 2-3 months," a source said.
Earlier the Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had said, "Each park estimated to attract a minimum investment of about Rs 125 crore".
After final approval for the project, the company needs to acquire minimum 50 acres of land within stipulated time. The company is free to decide the location of the project.
Government provides Rs 50 crore grant for each project on different cost constituents other the land cost, source added.
Meanwhile, Badal had pointed out that wastage of fruits, vegetables and grains worth Rs 44,000 crore annually was the primary cause of food inflation in the country.
"Therefore the Food Processing Ministry is focussing on bringing down the percentage of losses in agricultural commodities particularly in fruits and vegetables," she said.
The Ministry is also developing food maps of the country to identify areas for surplus of raw material for processing. It is also working on to identify clusters for setting up of food processing industries.

(The proposal could hit government's…)
NEW DELHI: The Telecom Commission has deferred a proposal on imposing an annual licence fee of 8 per cent on Internet service providers (ISPs) as this could lead to a hike in Internet charges and impact the government's ambitious Digital India project.
The Department of Telecom (DoT) Secretary Rakesh Garg , who also chairs the Telecom Commission, at a meeting of the commission last week said the proposal needs to be discussed further as levying an annual fee may lead to a rise Internet tariffs and charges, sources said.
The proposal could hit government's plans to successfully implement the Digital India programme, a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , they added.
"DoT is of the view that imposing a fee on ISPs could hinder their efforts of connecting the cities and rural area through Internet and that will in turn impact Digital India," sources said.
Digital India is an umbrella programme with an outlay of Rs 1.13 lakh crore, which includes projects that aim to ensure government services are available to citizens electronically and people get benefits of the latest technology.
Earlier this year, sectoral regulator TRAI suggested a new definition of revenue for ISPs on which the government should levy 8 per cent annual fee.
TRAI had suggested a uniform licence fee of 8 per cent of the AGR (adjusted gross revenue) for all ISP and ISP-Internet Telephony licences.
Government levies licence fee on AGR of telecom firms after deducting some components that are not earned from telecom services.
TRAI had earlier also recommended that government levy 8 per cent licence fee from April 1, 2013, but the proposal was deferred then, after questions raised on revenue items that should be considered for calculating the final charges.
Industry body Internet Service Providers Association of India had said the move to increase licence fee on Internet services will adversely affect its target to achieve 175 million broadband connections by 2017 and 600 million by 2020 as it will increase service tariffs.
ISPAI had also said if government includes deduction of bandwidth and lease line charges to pass through than Internet rates will rise only 8 per cent. If not, then cascading effect will be to the tune of 25-30 per cent.
Government's National Telecom Policy 2012 aims to provide affordable and reliable broadband-on-demand by the year 2015 and to achieve 175 million broadband connections by the year 2017 and 600 million by the year 2020 at minimum 2 Mbps download speed and making available higher speeds of at least 100 Mbps on demand.

(TCS will also make 800 offers…)
By Richa Maheshwari
MUMBAI|BANGALORE: After a few tepid years at college campuses, information technology companies are back to hiring in big numbers as Tata Consultancy Services , Infosys and HCL Technologies ramp up recruitment. This is good news to the over 1.5 million engineers who graduate from the country's colleges every year and are struggling to land a job due to an oversupply of talent.
Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest IT services company , said it will hire 35,000 freshers for fiscal 2016, boosting its rate of campus recruitment.The company hired 25,000 from campuses in fiscal 2015. Robust growth prospects led to the company raising the figure, TCS' human resources head Ajoy Mukherjee told ET.
TCS will also make 800 offers in the United States as part of its plan to bring 500 freshers from the United States on its rolls in fiscal 2016. In the current financial year, the company is hiring 400 US freshers.
Engineering colleges have also noticed the uptick. Last month, VIT in Tamil Nadu saw Wipro, Infosys and Cognizant, among others, making more offers than the previous year. While Wipro made 1,141 job offers, Accenture made 1,324 offers. Similarly , Infosys made 1,452 offers and Cognizant 1,911. "I think we see more appetite to take on more freshers and entry level hires as well," said Prithvi Shergill, chief human resource officer at HCL Technologies. "I think there will always be fluctuations, but yes , we are seeing an upward trend in entry level hiring." He declined to give the company's fresher hiring numbers for the next financial year.
Bangalore-based Infosys has also said it would hire between 15,000-16,000 freshers for the current financial year, a sharp increase from the 6,000 freshers it hired in fiscal 2013. The company has not re vealed its campus hiring figure for the next financial year.
The increased hiring from campuses comes as the IT industry is preparing for higher growth. "It is a good sign because fresher hiring tends to be considered a lead ing indicator for how companies view fu ture demand. While the jobs are good for the freshers, I don't think their starting salaries will be rising," an analyst with a Mumbai based brokerage told ET. He declined to be identified because he is not authorised to talk to the media. IT companies count on freshers to keep costs low. Analyst firm HfS estimated that TCS effectively achieved a 6.3% reduction in average employee costs every year over 2007-2013. During this peri od, the percentage of new graduates hired of the total rose from 50% to 80%.
"Fresher hiring continues and has to con tinue mainly because it is one of the impor tant levers to manage the cost and to ensure that they balance the pyramid," said Sunda raman Viswanathan, management consult ant at Zinnov Management Consultancy .
"The fresher hiring will be there for at least the next three-five years and the levels will be maintained." Part of the reason for this is that wage hikes in the industry have drop0 ped to single digits and starting salaries for a new graduates have been stagnant for over t four years as oversupply and softness in the IT industry pressured wages. TCS' Mukhert jee said the company had not changed fresh er salaries for the offers it had made for the s next financial year.

MNCs use social media tools to recruit the right candidateMNCs like Uber Cabs and Twitter India using social media tools to recruit the right candidate

(These companies aren't…)
NEW DELHI: Uber Cabs and Twitter India are hiring. But unless you follow the right people on Twitter or are on their mailing list, you'll never know about it. These companies aren't putting out advertisements on their websites or using traditional recruitment companies to find them the best candidates; but have been sending out mailers and tweets to customers or followers.
The team for Twitter India has posted tweets inviting candidates to apply for a job in Mumbai.It reads: "Team @TwitterIndia is looking for an associate partnerships manager to join us.#ApplyNow."
Uber Cabs is looking for managers and has decided to go the non-traditional route to find them. In a mail to clients in Delhi, it said: "Are you fired up by the opportunity to move your city through data and analytics, world-class support and creative strategy? Come join us!" The company's general manager in Delhi, Gagan Bhatia, said people who have used their service are the ideal candidates since they are locals. "This is a fantastic tool to use for recruiting."
Social recruitment has taken off with a bang over the past year. "It's a quick process that helps short-listing candidates while doing some research on them. We help clients like Sula Vineyards and L'Oreal find junior to midand senior-level executives," said Zafar Rais, founder and chief executive at Mindshift Interactive, a digital outreach company .
According to Rais, about two million jobs are posted on Twitter every month and around 39% of all job seekers are on Twitter and 23% have leveraged Twitter in their job hunt. In addition to this, 45% of the Fortune 500 companies include links to social media on their career pages and 45% are hiring managers to use social media websites to check candidate backgrounds. The most popular social media or networking sites used for recruiting are LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and BranchOut.
And candidates, too, are getting smarter. They are engaging with brands, analysing activities on social media and then drawing out job offers from there.
Companies like Aircel, Cognizant Technology Solutions , Expedia and HCL Technologies are conducting recruitment drives exclusively through social media platforms. Some of the other big names in the social recruitment space are Infosys and the Tatas, who use social HR as a tool to recruit prospective employees. Cosmetics brand L'Oreal launched its Facebook page `L'Oreal Careers' and International Business Machines provides a `Smarter Workforce' technology to help businesses capture and understand data from social media. HCL has saved over $500,000 on recruitment costs by leveraging LinkedIn.
One of the main reasons for the shift, say social media experts, is that the dynamics of the traditional recruitment processes are changing."Social media has a pull factor. It helps engage prospective candidates and companies have to convince them to work with them. It helps get passionate and more committed candidates than someone who was pursued by an human resource manager," said Ankita Gaba, co-founder of social media knowledge website socialsamosa.com.
Sumana Samuk, account director at advertising company Ogilvy & Mather who looks at social media strategy for brands, said companies must be integrated with social media platforms."Business will use this as a way forward to hire.It not only shortens the process of hiring but also saves cost for organisations. In addition to this, social profiles are representative, more or less of what the candidate is and it's good to do research on them before hiring."

Mumbai Airport s cargo terminal in shamblesCentral Board of Excise and Customs
(The Mumbai International…)
MUMBAI: Thursday, October 9, 3.30 PM. The narrow, dusty road to Mumbai airport's cargo terminal is lined with trucks as far as the eyes can see. Amol, a scraggly teenager, is asleep in a tempo he has been driving. Awakened, he says he has been in the queue since 4 in the morning. In almost 12 hours — that is, more than the time it takes to fly to any European destination — his cargo has barely moved one kilometre, and is still two trucks away from the entrance. Inside the gate, the queue scatters into several smaller lines, crawling to facilities that handle different kinds of cargo: general exports, perishable exports, imports, etc.
About 1,200 trucks come into the airport every day. But there is no order. Several trucks carrying light cargo sneak into a shorter queue actually meant exclusively for heavy vehicles carrying over 300 tonnes of freight. Some export cargo vehicles divert into the line of empty trucks waiting for import consignments. Many trucks are parked in a space not meant for parking.
Outside the general export cargo wing — the space handling the single largest bulk of freight at the airport — loaders dump boxes and pellets of different shapes and sizes. This is no storage space. But they will lie there for hours, until hundreds of boxes inside the facility are cleared for flying. By the time one of the boxes in Amol's tempo makes its way to the final stack, it will be midnight, 20 hours after it came to the airport.
The GVK-run Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) may boast of a spanking new Rs 5,500-crore passenger terminal decorated with the best of Indian art, offering seamless connectivity to passengers and making experts marvel at the efficient usage of space, but its cargo facility lies sadly neglected — suffering frequent systemic outages and massive pile-up of freight due to handling loads beyond what its space allows, operator's lack of discipline, overbooking by airlines and mass dumping by freight companies. "The Mumbai cargo terminal is generations behind other airports," said the general manager of Indian cargo operations of a top European carrier.
"The terminal, the storage space, the parking facilities and the staff are all massively stretched and working way beyond their capacity," the person said, speaking on condition that his and his company's identities are not revealed. "There is a major blame game happening between the stakeholders, and there is limited space to expand," the person added.
The immediate trigger for the long queue of trucks and massive pile-up of cargo at the airport that handles the biggest chunk of air cargo in the country was the long holiday at the start of this month when the customs department, which clears all cargo, shut systems for the first five days, according to executives of MIAL, airlines and freight agents. This couldn't have happened at a worse time, because almost 70 per cent of India's export cargo goes to Europe and the US in the months leading to Christmas.
"A few of our trucks had to wait three days outside the terminal," said Manish Shah, managing director of freight forwarder Magnum Cargo. Yet, almost all stakeholders agree that the ills of the Mumbai airport's cargo terminal is not about a long shut down of the customs system; it is facing multiple problems from space constraints to mismanagement to unfair practices.
SPACE CONSTRAINTS
Surrounded by slum areas, housing societies and imposing billboards that often get into an aircraft's way of flight, Mumbai airport's biggest bane has always been space. The airport handles 31 per cent of India's air cargo in much less space than other top airports. Last month, for example, MIAL handled close to 18,000 tonnes of general export cargo in 16,000 square meters of space, according to a MIAL spokesperson.
Delhi airport handled almost the same amount of cargo in 46,500 sqm, according to industry figures. Adding to the space crunch is the fact that MIAL has to almost equally share its facilities with national carrier Air India, which does third party cargo handling for other carriers. MIAL executives say the equal division of space is unfair because the airport operator handles several times more cargo than Air India.
In the general exports section, for instance, the national carrier handles cargo of nine airlines while MIAL handles close to 37 airlines. MIAL executives say they have been trying for the last three years to convince Air India to shift to a new facility, but the carrier has refused to do so. Air India, in turn, said the airport operator has yet to provide alternate spaces for the areas it has vacated in the airport, adding the space dispute has to be looked at in the entirety of the airport complex and not just the cargo terminal.

Much to fear from Gadkari’s plan for Mumbai’s docklandMuch to fear from Nitin Gadkari’s grandiose plan for Mumbai’s dockland
By Bachi Karkaria, ET Bureau | 17 Oct, 2014, 12.17PM IST
Dockland renewal plan again offers  30% for open space, but who can believe that too will not be doomed to Mumbai’s siren song of encroachment. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
He used to be called 'Mr Flyover'when he was Maharashtra's PWD minister in the late 1990s because of the 55 spans he had planned for Mumbai. In his bigger avatar at the Centre, Nitin Gadkari is clearly in no mood to subject his ambitions to bariatric surgery. His shipping and ports ministry has set up a committee to prepare a draft plan to exploit commercially some 1,000 of the 1,800 acres owned by the Mumbai Port Trust, and turn this decrepitude into a 'vibrant zone'.
For decades now, most shipping has moved further down to Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust or Gujarat's booming ports. So the earmarked zone, equal to a jaw-dropping 130 Nariman Points, is now pocked by rundown buildings, shabby warehouses, tinpot scrap shops, opportunistic shanties and the skeletal remains of a frenetic dock which serviced Mumbai's fortune-spinning mills for a glorious century.
So, you'd think that the promise of a phoenix rising from this depressing mess would send hallelujahs ringing to the suspended particulate matter laden skies. Alas, the only heart leaping is that of the unrepentant urban villain, the politician-developer nexus.
Those who really care for Mumbai are gripped with a sinking deja vu. In 1991 the city had awaited a similar redemption: the opening up of 600 acres of defunct mill land, like this dock area, right in prime south and central Mumbai. Then, too, the vision of cheap, decent housing and 160 acres of open space had dangled tantalisingly within reach - only to be plucked away by a sleight of hand.
Development Control Rule 58, meant to be a three-part division of all mill land, was surreptitiously amended in 2001 by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh to apply only to vacant land. Every small shed dotting the mill sprawl was now counted as 'built area'. So, Mumbai got only one-fifth of its expected due. To the notorious duo of politician-deve-loper, add the mill-owners whose cobwebbed inheritance now turned to real estate gold.
Charles Correa's brilliant, integra-ted plan for development of the mill lands was junked. Today the folly of haphazard, greedy, builder-ordained growth is painfully evident in the new smokeless stacks arrogantly spearing the skyline amidst every symptom of urban blight.
Which is why only scepticism greets the announcement of a new Gotham of commercial establishments, convention centres and entertainment zones. The promised leisurescape of marinas and parks threatens to become a garish mess of food stalls, floating hotels and that new houri of tourist paradise, the London Eye wannabe.
The dockland renewal plan again offers a seductive 30% for open space, but who can believe that too will not be doomed to Mumbai's siren song of encroachment. Funds for public advantage can come only through commercial exploitation of a portion of former depressed areas. Across the world, this is a given. But in India's rampaging urbania, all the soothing bits meant for the beleaguered citizen are invariably taken away.
Globally, the post-industrial age is littered with the debris of obsolescence. Disused mills, automobile factories, railway lines and docks became the 'rust belt' of cities flaunting new avatars. Change is not just inevitable, but desirable. Yet the best examples of urban regeneration show us that 'development' is not just mall-to-mall carpeting. Yes, the condos and office blocks are there, but so are the spaces for art galleries, craft centres, sporting facilities and simply swathes of clean, breathable green for the old, young and in-between.
Mumbai desperately needs a make-over of its decrepit docklands, but for the needs of its space-starved citizens not the greed of builders, netas and file-blocking babus. This grossly underutilised stretch is not just an eyesore, but a criminal waste. An honest regeneration plan must be accelerated and not stymied.

(Reuters) - The president of the Russian Tennis Federation Shamil Tarpischev has been fined $25,000 and banned from the women's tour for a year after referring to Serena and Venus Williams as "the Williams brothers" on a television chat show last week.
Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) chief executive Stacy Allaster said the comments were "insulting, demeaning and have absolutely no place on our sport".
Allaster added: "Mr. Tarpischev’s statements questioning their genders tarnish our great game and two of our champions. His derogatory remarks deserve to be condemned and he will be sanctioned.
"As a result of his comments I have ordered Mr. Tarpischev to be fined $25,000, the maximum allowed under WTA rules."
She added that he would be suspended from any involvement with the WTA for a year.
World number one Serena Williams has won 18 grand slam singles titles while her sister Venus has won seven majors.
Dave Haggerty, president of the United States Tennis Association, called on Tarpischev to issue an apology.
"As the president of the Russian Tennis Federation and a member of the International Olympic Committee, Mr. Tarpischev is expected to conduct himself with the highest degree of integrity and sportsmanship," Haggerty said in a statement.
"Unfortunately, his comments do not embody either of these traits and in fact were reprehensible."

Central govt decides to observe only Mahatmas anniversariesCentral govt decides to observe only Mahatma’s anniversaries
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 19, 2014

In a fresh twist to the ongoing debate over appropriation of Congress icons, Narendra  Modi government Saturday decided to disassociate itself from the birth and death anniversaries of all departed national leaders except Mahatma Gandhi.
It would mean that the government would no longer be associated with the anniversaries of former Prime Ministers including Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.
Incidentally, the government also re-constituted the committee to commemorate the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru.

The committee to be headed by Prime Minister Modi comprises top ministers and also many Congress leaders including Mallikarjun Kharge, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Karan Singh and Gandhi family loyalist Suman Dubey, among others.
The UPA government had first constituted the committee headed by Manmohan Singh, with Congress president Sonia Gandhi as a member.
She resigned after the NDA government took over. Subsequently, the Congress constituted a committee headed by former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit to commemorate Nehru’s 125th anniversary.
The NDA government’s decision to reconstitute a parallel committee came hours before the Union Cabinet decided to dissociate the government from the birth and death anniversaries of national leaders, including all former PMs.
According to Saturday’s cabinet decision, such functions of other departed national leaders may be observed by respective trusts, parties, societies or supporters.
While the Cabinet’s decision only reiterated the Vajpayee Cabinet’s decision in 2000, it is likely to cause heartburns in the opposition Congress as the UPA government had ignored the NDA cabinet’s decision to organise these anniversaries.  During the UPA tenure, the Union government organised the anniversaries of Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Choudhary Charan Singh and Rajiv Gandhi.
“Gandhiji’s birth and death anniversary, which is managed by the Rajghat Committee, will be a function organised by the central government and for all our other national leaders, it will be private societies or trusts of their supporters, parties, family members which will organise these functions,” finance minister Arun Jaitley said after the Cabinet meeting.
Earlier, Congress leaders had attacked Modi for his silence on reconstituting the committee to commemorate Nehru’s birth anniversary alleging that there were “deliberate attempts to scuttle” the Nehruvian legacy and cited the move to scrap the planning commission as one such instance.

Why India needs a  quinoa revolution Why India needs a 'quinoa revolution' to solve malnutrition, diabetes and cardiac problems

Hollywood stars glorified it, NASA de-mystified it. It is now up to India to embrace the healthy food and check malnutrition

By Srinivasa Rao
You should develop a project that can make a big impact." So said Narendra Modi , the then chief minister of Gujarat, in our one- to-one meeting, as we chatted about various topics, including alleviating malnutrition in India. My friends in Gujarat had enabled this lengthy thought-provoking discussion with him.
Ever since, I have been based in my true home India, with only short visits to my other home in New York. I started exploring all possible ideas in the realms of both technology and food, with the single-minded focus of reducing malnutrition. At the suggestion of my physician daughter, my wife, also a physician, introduced quinoa, a grain crop and a species of goosefoot grown primarily for its edible seeds, as a healthy food in our cuisine.
It took an 'aha' moment for me to start looking at its value in the context of alleviating malnutrition. That discovery led me to Bolivia, the mecca of quinoa. I met many Bolivians to understand the grain, science, production, processing and its impact on nutrition and economy.
Time for Next Revolution
The White Revolution in India made the country milk-sufficient and the largest producer in the world while generating rural employment. India needs another such revolution to reduce malnutrition. India's malnutrition is over 45% among children and 70% among pregnant women. It is eroding the productivity of the country by 4-6% of GDP.
Since India's Independence, four revolutions — wheat, milk, pharma and IT — put us on the path of prosperity. But healthcare remains a missed opportunity alongside manufacturing, tourism and nuclear energy.
Today, India tops global charts in malnutrition and also diabetes. Excess carbohydrates lead to diabetes. Lack of adequate food or inadequate nutritive value in the food causes malnutrition. Quinoa could be the silver bullet that addresses both these issues.
What is Quinoa?
Quinoa is a seed of plant Chenopodium quinoa and is spinach's close cousin. It has been cultivated in the Andean regions of South America for more than 7,000 years. Colonization by Europeans suppressed the crop. It took two scientists at National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) — Dr Greg Schlick and Dr David L Bubenheim — to put quinoa back on the map when they concluded in their research that "quinoa has desirable food qualities for long-term space missions — high protein and desirable amino acid composition".
The year 2013 was declared as the International Year of Quinoa by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations as a recognition of the "crop's resilience, adaptability and its potential contribution in the fight against hunger and malnutrition". FAO hopes that quinoa is destined to carry the task of both boosting food security and providing economic growth to small-scale farmers as the crop does not make much demand on soil fertility, water and labour. The demand for quinoa increased 18 fold in the last decade with annual production scaling 100,000 tonnes. It did not hurt when some Hollywood celebrities revealed that quinoa was their "superfood."
But thanks to such revelations and the increased demand, the price has multiplied seven fold to $10 a kg. Apart from its nutritive values, it is proven that quinoa has the ability to uplift farmers from poverty. Bolivian government officials, scientists and businessmen told me that reverse migration from cities to rural areas is happening so as to grow royal quinoa.
A Superfood
Quinoa's average protein content (15%) surpasses that of wheat (12%) and rice (6%). It has high-quality protein and wellbalanced amino acids with vitamins and minerals, iron in particular. Quinoa is gluten free and good for people with digestive disorders. Dr AA Dixit's (Department of Sociomedical Sciences, Columbia University, New York) team reported that "quinoa replacement with one serving of white rice in diet can prevent obesity and cardiovascular disease". It can be consumed like a staple food, replacing wheat or rice, unlike other protein-rich foods.
'Big Project' for the PM
Even if India grows quinoa at 1% of annual production of rice and wheat, it will be 2 million tonnes. Its economic value can be $10 billion (Rs 60,000 crore) at current prices. India needs several million tonnes of quinoa a year to meet the requirement of its diabetics, cardiac patients and malnourished children. This can be another cash crop for millions of farmers. India has 130 agro-climatic zones and several of them can be suitable for quinoa.
Today there is enough data to emphatically claim that quinoa can be 'The Big Project' for making a 'Big Impact'. It has the potential to be the next revolution and the solution for malnutrition, diabetes and cardiac problems. While doing so, it can help small farmers and boost commercial exports. With so much at stake, can India afford to miss the quinoa bus?

Maharashtra: CM s post will prove key to BJP-Sena mending fencesComments
With the magic figure of 145 seats not in its sights, the BJP may to have to seek support from estranged ally Shiv Sena to form the next government in Maharashtra.
Trends indicate the BJP may not get beyond 120 seats, but it could still claim power by reviving its alliance with the Sena, which may get 60 seats. The BJP will need 145 seats to guarantee the next Maharashtra chief minister will emerge from its ranks.
Sources said that Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena, equally keen on the chief minister’s post, may explore other options like seeking support from parties other than the BJP in a bid to keep its former ally out of power.
Political experts did not rule out a possibility of the NCP supporting the BJP from outside.
Read: With BJP in clear lead, attention turns to potential CM candidates
The Congress and the NCP were both inching towards 50 seats.
The BJP-Sena had formed the first non-Congress government in Maharshtra in 1995, but the alliance broke ahead of the assembly polls this year. The bone of contention was the CM's post, which may again play a pivotal role in negotiations between the two ex-partners.
BJP state chief Devendra Fadnavis said from Nagpur that the Sena wasn't his party's enemy. But he said the language the Sena used against the BJP in campaigning had hurt his party.
The Sena did not rule out a tie-up. Party spokesperson Nilam Gorhe said it was too early to commit anything. "Our top leadership will decide it after results are out," he said.

The election results from Haryana and Maharashtra are positive affirmation of Modi’s continuing grip on the electorate’s imagination. The Modi wave has swept through Haryana, demolishing the Congress, the Indian National Lok Dal and two other parties that do not now even deserve to be listed by name. From a strength of 4 seats in the 90 member Haryana house, the BJP has now acquired a majority on its own, thanks primarily to Modi’s personal appeal. The BJP does not even have a recognisable leader in Haryana.
In Maharashtra, the BJP story is less compelling, although impressive. The BJP has emerged as the single largest party but falls short of a majority. In fact, if the non-BJP parties want to spite the BJP, they can form a government with Sena at the helm and the others in alliance or offering outside support.
But Modi has conclusively demonstrated that his judgment that the BJP has become more popular than the Shiv Sena and deserves to be the dominant partner in their alliance has been vindicated. The party’s vote share has doubled to about 32% and the credit legitimately goes to Modi than to any regional leader of the party.
However, the stridency of his attack on the Sena during the campaign shows that Modi believed that the BJP would get a majority on its own. That gamble has not paid off. Now, he would have to make that phone call to Uddhav Thackeray to make peace and form the government it is theirs to form together in Maharashtra. The fact that the Shiv Sena’s Anand Geete continues to be a member of the Union government shows that neither the BJP nor the Sena has any hostility towards the other sharp enough to rule out coming together once again in Maharashtra.
The Maharashtra result is notable for the Congress retaining about 50 seats, even in its current state of being completely discredited, leaderless at the state-level and at the Centre and wholly clueless about how to revive itself after being knocked out in the Lok Sabha elections. This means that a Congress-free India, which the BJP has declared to be its medium-term goal, will be quite tough.
For the BJP, its dependence on one man, their mascot, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased. In the process, it has emerged the largest party in Maharastra, broken the dominance of caste in Haryana politics and positioned itself as a party still on the ascendant.
It is time for the government to Centre to turn its mind to taking the tough decisions such as slashing subsidies and boosting investment in the economy, without having to worry about short-term political costs.

Unlimited holidays Indian HR experts not en...Unlimited holidays? Indian human resource experts not enthused

Holiday
(Last month, Richard Branson,…)
NEW DELHI: As companies across the world experiment with concepts like "unlimited holidays", human resource experts in India believe the country is not ready for such agile HR policy and people here would rather appreciate benefits like leave encashment and sabbaticals.
Last month, Richard Branson, Founder and CEO of Virgin group said he would offer his employees unlimited holidays.
"Flexible working has revolutionised how, where and when we all do our jobs. So, if working nine to five no longer applies, then why should strict annual leave (vacation) policies?," questioned Branson.
The sole premise on which Sir Richard Branson announced the 'unlimited holidays' policy was that one should focus on what work has been done, and not on how many hours or days a person has worked.
Virgin is not the first one to introduce this concept, as reportedly other companies like Netflix , Zynga, Groupon, Glassdoor, Evernote are some who offer such benefits.
Such a policy may seem benevolent but in industries where human talent is critical for a competitive advantage, it could be a game changer for attracting and retaining talent and for creating favourable corporate branding, experts said.
"Companies that offer unlimited vacation time tend to invest in hiring motivated, responsible employees who balance taking time off with getting their work done. Such a policy is great in attracting and retaining talent," Thomas Cook (India) COO and Head Human Resources Mona Cheriyan said.
Sharing similar views Kempinski Ambience Hotel GM Puneet Singh said "having the freedom to work, whenever one wants, for however long one wants, boosts morale, creativity, productivity, quality of life. ...however, it is limited to companies, that work on project based or time bound sector, or where creativity is at the core".
Unlimited holidays is an interesting approach but it can be applied partly and in limited situations in India as our work ethics, corporate culture is not ready for this, experts say.
In India, "being there" for the sake of being there when bosses are around, is still the case in a majority of corporations, they added. In a majority of companies, even something as basic as a 5-day week is not introduced and people are still slogging for 6 days, 9-12 hours a day, a top HR official said.
However, most US companies have 7-8 public holidays and 1-2 weeks of paid vacation while in comparison Indian firms typically have 10-12 public holidays and 4 weeks of paid leave.
"India is yet to mature to this flexibility as employers and employees still believe in time spent in the office rather than productivity on the time spent," executive search firm GlobalHunt India MD Sunil Goel said.
Employee productivity improvement solutions provider, Sapience Analytics' CEO and Co-founder Shirish Deodhar said: "It is an interesting approach that can be applied in limited situations. Policies like sabbaticals, leave encashment, buying extra holidays and medical leave at half pay, are likely to be more popular and relevant for India."
Employee privilege platform Vantage Circle CEO Partha Neog, however, believes "new age companies in industries like internet, mobile, software have modern managerial approach and HR philosophy. Such industries, that are intelligence driven, are always at the edge of that next level."
"Indian companies have been exploring innovative flexible options at the workplace for a while now. There is however no one-size-fits-all solution possible. The success of any initiative will lie in how well it is crafted for or adapted to the particular company, their team members and the socio -cultural backdrop that they operate in," Godrej Spokesperson - Sumit Mitra, Head - Group HR and Corporate Services said.
At Godrej, we believe that leave is important in itself and must be encouraged and it should not be treated as part of compensation, Mitra said, adding that a couple of years ago, Godrej has reworked its Sick Leave policy.
"Sick leave is now uncapped and trust-based because we don't believe that you can put a number to falling ill. Godrejites can avail of it on a 'need to' basis," Mitra said.

NEW DELHI: Amid cut-throat competition and allegations of predatory pricing between online and offline retailers, Chinese electronics major Lenovo is working on bringing in differentiated products for the two platforms to offer a wider choice of devices to end-consumers.
Many sellers on popular e-commerce sites like Flipkart and Snapdeal have been selling products, especially electronics, on discounted rates or what physical retail stores refer to as "predatory pricing".
Lenovo was among the first players to caution consumers against buying from unauthorised e-commerce platforms and online shopping sites. Since then, players like Asus, HP and Canon have issued similar advisories.
"We have always said the business of discounted pricing cannot last forever. It is not sustainable in the long run. While we have issued advisories in the past to customers, now we are working on a differentiated products strategy where specific products are sold online and another offline," Lenovo India Managing Director Amar Babu told PTI.
Consumers can check both and then decide on what suits their needs, he added.
"This will help both online and offline retailers and consumers will also get a wider range of devices to choose from," he said.
Industry players have in the past raised their objections to "predatory pricing" that they say is hurting the industry.
"We have already said we will not offer warranty to devices purchased from unauthorised sellers. We are also taking steps to identify people who are indulging in such activities and stopping supply to them," Babu said.
Traders body CAIT has expressed concerns over huge discounts being offered by e-commerce firms and has asked the Commerce and Industry Ministry to take steps to monitor and regulate online businesses.
It has also demanded for setting up of a regulatory authority for e-commerce business in India.

Modi govt must launch enquiry into aircraft deal that ruined Air IndiaModi government must launch enquiry into the aircraft deal that ruined Air India
Oct 19, 2014, 10.08AM IST
Tags:
(In the years prior to the…)
By: Jitender Bhargava
The sordid story of the humongous aircraft purchase for Air India that led to its financial ruin has again taken centre stage after Vinod Rai, former CAG, looks deep into the deal in his just released book Not Just An Accountant.
Praful Patel, who was aviation minister then and widely believed to be the man behind the deal, continues to deny his role — you only had to watch Times Now the other day to see his "spirited" defence. His defence, however, falls flat before those conversant with the actual events surrounding the deal.
In 2005, the year in which the aircraft order was placed, Air India, had an annual revenue of Rs 8,000 crore. The cost of the 68 aircraft (18 short haul and 50 long haul) ordered was Rs 39,000 crore. Even the best airlines operate on wafer-thin profit margins.
Read Praful Patel's defence
Simple arithmetic will show that Air India, which had to finance the aircraft by availing loans because it had no reserves (the government was pitching in only with less than 2% of the cost), would have to bear an interest burden of up to Rs 2,000 crore annually as the delivery of planes began in July 2007.
Remember, in the years prior to the order, Air India was making only a modest profit. It did not require a genius to see a financial tragedy was waiting to unfold.
Compliant Board
Nonetheless, the Air India board "recommended" the acquisition. This happened after Patel asked the Air India brass in a meeting on August 2, 2004 to revisit its earlier acquisition plan of 28 aircraft (18 short haul and 10 long haul). The board had earlier recommended purchase of only 10 long-haul aircraft because the Air India management had said the Net Present Value would be positive for an order of this size.
In other words, the 10 planes were all that Air India could afford. It is bewildering why the board did not question how then could the NPV be positive for 50 long-haul aircraft.
Only Sunil Arora, a board member by dint of being chairman of Indian Airlines, questioned the flaw. The silence of the management and representatives of the ministry on the board can be explained due to fear of reprisal — additional secretary V Subramanian was shunted out within two hours of asking basic questions on the business plan, financing etc.
The internal dynamics of how board meetings were conducted in Patel's era could provide some answers. In a letter to the cabinet secretary on June 2, 2005, Arora shared instances of blatant ministerial interference. He also described how a key meeting was held. He said board members received a notice on December 21, 2004 that a meeting will be held the next day in Delhi as an aircraft maker had raised the possible impact of changes in specifications on the deal.
  No agenda papers were made available to members. A decision was still taken. Clearly, this calls Patel's bluff when he says that neither he nor the ministry was connected with the nuts and bolts of the aircraft acquisition. The story doesn't end here.
Patel, as he said in his recent TV interview, requested the prime minister to constitute an Overseeing Committee and an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) to examine the deal.
However, the minutes of the meetings reveal that the two committees looked only at the concessions/discounts from the vendor and technical details. There is no mention of the Overseeing Committee discussing the number of aircraft recommended for purchase — which is the crux of the problem.
Besides seeking concessions from the vendor, the EGoM took two key decisions. To quote the minutes: "In pursuance of the above discussions, the proposal contained in para 10 of the note for EGoM is approved".
This 'note' came from the aviation ministry. The other decision — "Air India will place the entire order for 68 aircraft with Boeing on firm basis" — was devastating for the airline as its own eventual proposal and the one by the aviation ministry (endorsed by the Public Investment Board) were for buying 18 short haul aircraft and 35 long-haul aircraft and retaining 15 as options.
Who is the Mastermind?
Patel has said it was former finance minister P Chidambaram's decision (Chidambaram headed the EGoM) to order all aircraft on firm basis. If we were to believe that, it displays the casualness with which such a critical decision — the cost of 15 more long-haul aircraft was nearly $2 billion — was taken.
Could Chidambaram have taken a decision without going through the financial implications? Wasn't it Patel's responsibility to brief the EGoM members of the deal's implications? The minutes make no mention of the decision being thrust on an unwilling Patel.
Rather, he happily announced the deal after the meeting. There are too many mysteries surrounding the aircraft deal. But who was instrumental in forcing Air India to buy the aircraft? If Praful Patel really wishes to dispel the widespread belief of his dubious role in ruining Air India financially, he should be the one seeking a probe. Let us hope the new damning revelations in Rai's book will force the Narendra Modi government to launch a full probe.

Ajay Banga among world s best performing CEOsAjay Banga
(Under Banga, who was named…)
NEW YORK: Financial services giant Mastercard's CEO Ajay Banga is the sole Indian-origin top executive in a list of 100 best-performing CEOs in the world compiled by the prestigious magazine Harvard Business Review (HBR), with Amazon CEO Jeffrey Bezos topping the rankings.
The Harvard magazine's annual 'Best-Performing CEOs in the World' 2014 list comprises global chief executives who "actually delivered solid results over the long run."
India-born Banga is ranked 64th on the list, which specifically took into account the increase in total shareholder return and market capitalization in ranking the CEOs.
Under Banga, who was named Mastercard CEO in 2010, total shareholder return was 169 per cent while market capitalisation grew $66 billion.
The list includes Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers at the third spot, Yum Brands CEO David Novak (12), Netflix chief Reed Hastings (23), Canon CEO Fujio Mitarai (45), Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz (54), Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger (60), Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer (73) and Nike CEO Mark Parker (76).
However, the list of 100 lacks gender diversity as it consists of only two women, Debra Cafaro of IT firm Ventas (27) and Carol Meyrowitz of retalier TJX (51).
HBR focused mostly on long-term results and the performance of active CEOs over their entire stints.
Only those CEOs were included who have been in their jobs for at least two years.
The top CEOs have been effective with the first 50 having delivered total shareholder returns of 1,350 per cent during their time on the job.
"...Being a good CEO is about far more than just investment performance. Leading a company and creating value depend on many skills that are hard to measure--strategic vision, authenticity, long-term planning. And investors certainly aren't the only stakeholders that need tending to; the best-run companies connect effectively with customers, employees, and the communities where they operate," HBR said.
Banga is among the 13 CEOs whose nationalities differ from their companies.
While the top 100 have each experienced their own unique journeys to success, ver a quarter of the CEOs have MBAs and nearly as many had studied engineering.
Twenty-four of HBR's 100 best-performing CEOs have undergraduate or graduate degrees in engineering, compared with 29 who have MBAs. Eight CEOs have both degrees.
At technology or science-based companies, it's not a big surprise to find an engineer at the helm but engineers thrive at the top of other kinds of firms too, HBR said.
On what makes an engineering degree useful to people leading a business, Harvard Business School's India-born dean Nitin Nohria said "studying engineering gives someone a practical, pragmatic orientation."
Nohria holds an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai.

BJP leads in Maharashtra  reaches out to SenaBJP leads in Maharashtra, reaches out to Sena
By Quaid Najmi | IANS –  Sun 19 Oct, 2014
Print
Mumbai, Oct 19 (IANS) The BJP Sunday indicated it was ready to reach out to its estranged ally Shiv Sena as it led in about 120 seats but seemed to be falling short of a majority in the Maharashtra assembly.
Shortly after asserting that his party would win a majority in the 288-member house, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis sounded conciliatory vis-a-vis the Sena, which the BJP dumped ahead of the Oct 15 election.
"We have not held any discussion with the Sena," Fadnavis told the media, as his party and three smaller allies led in some 120 seats, his own party count being 108.
"But if the need arises, we expect our friends to support us," he added.
The BJP had hoped to take power on its own in Maharashtra, one of the country's biggest states, for the first time after ending its 25-year-old alliance with the Sena.
One reason this did not happen is because the Sena, which campaigned aggressively against the BJP and on a strong Marathi platform, was on the winning track in 57 seats.
As the vote count continued, Shiv Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut said: "Whatever happens, the chief minister will be from our party. We will make our stand clear today evening."
At the same time, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which took broke their alliance just before the polls, ended up taking the lead in 48 and 50 seats respectively -- better than expected.
Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, however, cut a sorry figure. It was ahead in just six seats, and independents and other smaller parties -- including BJP's three allies -- in 12 places.
Shiv Sena leader Anil Desai told CNN-IBN television that the acrimony between his party and the BJP was history.
"The war between the Sena and the BJP is over," he said. But it wasn't clear if this reflected the views of the Sena leadership which had spoken virulently against Prime Minister Narenddra Modi during the campaign.
Fadnavis referred to this, saying the BJP had never regarded the Shiv Sena as its political foe.
"But the way they targeted us during the election campaign and in particular Narendra Modi, we are deeply hurt," he said earlier in the day. "As of now we are not thinking of any alliance (with the Sena)."
Asked if he could be the next chief minister, Fadnavis said he was only the state party chief and the BJP Parliamentary Board would take the final decision on the subject.
An early major loser was Congress veteran Narayan Rane, who lost in Kudal constituency. The first winner was Madhuri Misal of the BJP. She was declared elected from Parvatti in Pune district.
A peeved NCP blamed the Congress for the impending rout.
"It all happened because of Chavan," NCP's Nawab Malik told the media, referring to former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan of the Congress.
"He had no understanding of the issues in Maharashtra, he did not take the right decisions, and he didn't act when he had to. He is responsible for the state of both the Congress and the NCP," Malik said.
The NCP and Congress have been in power in Mahrashtra for 15 long years. The coalition came apart Sep 25, just three weeks before the Oct 15 polls, leading to President's Rule in the state.
Officials Sunday morning began counting the millions of votes cast in the assembly elections. In the fray were 4,119 candidates.

ET View: Modi continues to be king  delivers impressive performanceOctober 19, 2014, 11:54 am IST TK Arun in Cursor | India , Times View | ET
33
The election results from Haryana and Maharashtra are positive affirmation of Modi’s continuing grip on the electorate’s imagination. The Modi wave has swept through Haryana, demolishing the Congress, the Indian National Lok Dal and two other parties that do not now even deserve to be listed by name. From a strength of 4 seats in the 90 member Haryana house, the BJP has now acquired a majority on its own, thanks primarily to Modi’s personal appeal. The BJP does not even have a recognisable leader in Haryana.
In Maharashtra, the BJP story is less compelling, although impressive. The BJP has emerged as the single largest party but falls short of a majority. In fact, if the non-BJP parties want to spite the BJP, they can form a government with Sena at the helm and the others in alliance or offering outside support.
But Modi has conclusively demonstrated that his judgment that the BJP has become more popular than the Shiv Sena and deserves to be the dominant partner in their alliance has been vindicated. The party’s vote share has doubled to about 32% and the credit legitimately goes to Modi than to any regional leader of the party.
However, the stridency of his attack on the Sena during the campaign shows that Modi believed that the BJP would get a majority on its own. That gamble has not paid off. Now, he would have to make that phone call to Uddhav Thackeray to make peace and form the government it is theirs to form together in Maharashtra. The fact that the Shiv Sena’s Anand Geete continues to be a member of the Union government shows that neither the BJP nor the Sena has any hostility towards the other sharp enough to rule out coming together once again in Maharashtra.
The Maharashtra result is notable for the Congress retaining about 50 seats, even in its current state of being completely discredited, leaderless at the state-level and at the Centre and wholly clueless about how to revive itself after being knocked out in the Lok Sabha elections. This means that a Congress-free India, which the BJP has declared to be its medium-term goal, will be quite tough.
For the BJP, its dependence on one man, their mascot, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased. In the process, it has emerged the largest party in Maharastra, broken the dominance of caste in Haryana politics and positioned itself as a party still on the ascendant.
It is time for the government to Centre to turn its mind to taking the tough decisions such as slashing subsidies and boosting investment in the economy, without having to worry about short-term political costs.

Complacency a big danger for businessesComplacency a big danger for businesses, says Ratan Tata

CEO
(Tata also said it is really…)
NEW YORK: Cautioning that "complacency" is a big danger for any business, Tata Group's Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata has said that corporate leaders should keep injecting urgency without taking "cavalier risks".
In a commentary written for a publication of global consultancy McKinsey, Tata also said it is really important for companies to survive over the longer term and besides the ability to innovate, an attachment to good values also drives corporate longevity.
"One of the big dangers for any business is complacency; the challenge for leaders is how to keep injecting urgency. I think much depends on how good a CEO is at motivating his or her team and generating the sort of excitement that leads people to do things in different ways," Tata said while cautioning "that doesn't mean taking cavalier risks".
The commentary has been published in the 50th anniversary edition of the McKinsey Quarterly publication.
Ratan Tata served as the Chairman of Tata Sons, the group's holding company, for over two decades beginning 1991. He retired from the post on December 28, 2012 and now serves as Chairman Emeritus.
"One hundred years from now, of course, I expect Tata to be much bigger and more global than it is now. More important, I hope the group comes to be regarded as India's best, best in the way we operate, best in the products we deliver, and best in our value system and ethics," Tata said.
Founded by Jamsetji Tata in 1868, Tata group comprises over 100 operating companies, with operations in more than 100 countries across six continents. The group entities export products and services to over 150 countries.
On values, Tata said "It's something we have had throughout Tata's history and on which we never compromise. Values are in our DNA, and they have carried us into new markets, helped us redistribute our assets, and, ultimately, made us a successful global company".
Tata group entities are often featured in Fortune Magazine's most admired companies lists. UK-based Brand Finance has valued the Tata brand at USD 21.1 billion and ranked it 34th among the top 500 most valuable global brands in their global list for 2014.
"I hate to see major corporations disappearing from the scene because someone has cashed out, because the managers have been unable to escape their comfort zones, or because boards have not been sufficiently nimble to change with the times," Tata wrote.
Citing the importance of "managerial rotation", he said Tata group used to have managers who did not even rotate away from a single function, who started in manufacturing and finished in manufacturing or started in R&D and retired in R&D.
"Unilever is good at avoiding that, and we have learned from it," he added.
 
Tata said businesses should fight it out, whether the enemy is a competitor's new product, an industry-transforming innovation (such as transistors), or the impact of something clearly outside a company's control (like climate change).
"Disruptive events often provide the spark to change course or enter a new field, as opposed to allowing competitors to nibble at your feet," he said.
When previously protected Indian markets were opening up to foreign companies, some people tried to block those reforms at the time. But their impact now is visible everywhere, particularly in the automobile sector--all global car manufacturers are present in the Indian market.
"Open markets have encouraged local companies to adopt new technologies, to become more creative, to lower costs, and to improve offerings to the consumer," Tata said.

FDI dips to $1.27 billion in August, lowest in eight months

(Foreign direct investment…)
NEW DELHI: Foreign direct investment into India declined by about 10 per cent in August this year to $1.27 billion, the lowest figure in the last eight months.
In August 2013, the country had received FDI worth $1.40 billion. Last time in December 2013, FDI into India was $1.10 billion.
However, for the April-August period of this fiscal, 2014-15, the foreign inflows showed a growth of 42 per cent to $12.01 billion as compared to $8.46 billion in the first five months of 2013-14, according to the data of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion .
Amongst the top 10 sectors, telecom received the maximum FDI of $2.33 billion in the 5 months, followed by services ($1.08 billion), pharmaceuticals ($903 million) and construction ($446 million).
During the period, India received maximum FDI from Mauritius at $ 3.93 billion, followed by Singapore ($1.89 billion), Netherlands ($1.56 billion), Japan ($897 million), UK ($827 million) and the US ($394 million).
In 2013-14, FDI inflows in India were $24.29 billion as against $22.42 billion in 2012-13.
Decline in foreign investments could put pressure on the country's balance of payments and may also impact the value of the rupee.
The Indian rupee on Friday snapped a two-day declining trend and bounced back by 39 paise to end at 61.44 against the US dollar.
India requires around $1 trillion in the next five years to overhaul its infrastructure sector, including ports, airports and highways to boost growth.

Gas price hike to add Rs 1 950 cr to ONGC pr...You are here: Home > Collections
Gas price hike to add Rs 1,950 crore to ONGC profits this fiscal
PTI Oct 19, 2014, 12.18PM IST

Arun Jaitley
(Using GCV methodology…)
NEW DELHI: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will rake in about Rs 1,950 crore in additional profit this fiscal from the 46 per cent rise in natural gas prices announced by the government.
After postponing three times, the government yesterday approved a revised formula of pricing almost all domestically produced natural gas from November 1. The current price of $4.2 per million British thermal unit will rise to $6.17 per mmBtu on a like-to-like basis.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley yesterday said the price from November 1 will be $5.61 per mmBtu on heat value the fuel will generate on gross calorific value (GCV) basis.
But the current $4.2 per mmBtu rate is on net calorific value (NCV) basis, which is roughly 10 per more than heat value on GCV basis. In GCV terms, the current price comes to $3.8 per mmBtu.
Using GCV methodology announced by Jaitley, the price has gone up from $3.8 to $5.61 per mmBtu, over 46 per cent rise. If compared on NCV terms, the price will rise from $4.2 to $6.17 per mmBtu, a 46 per rise.
"The gas price increase is not 33 per cent - from $4.2 to $5.61 as it is not like-to-like comparison. Suppose you sell apples at a particular rate per pound and decide to price the same apple at a higher price per kg, then the increase has to be calculated on like-to-like terms," a senior industry official said.
ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf said the decision is a positive for the company as it will help monetise some of its small and marginal gas discoveries.
"Every $1 rise in gas price increases our revenues by Rs 4,000 crore and net profit by Rs 2,350 crore," he said.
An almost $2 increase in gas price will result in ONGC net profit going up by about Rs 4,700 crore on an annualised basis. For the five months of current fiscal, ONGC will stand to benefit about Rs 1,950 crore, he said.
The price may however be not enough for some of its deepsea gas finds particularly in the Krishna Godavari basin but the clause in yesterday's Cabinet approval that gas rates will be revised every six months with the next revision being on April 1, spells hope for the company.
By the time the discoveries come on production in 2018, rates would have risen further.
The new price, based on the recommendations of a Committee of Secretaries (CoS) that reviewed the UPA government's gas pricing guidelines of January 2013, would lead rise is gas-based power generation as well as fertilizer cost going up. It will also result in CNG and piped cooking gas (LPG) going up.
Also, the government will get additional revenue of Rs 3,800 crore annually.
The new price will be determined on Gross Calorific Value (GCV) basis and reviewed every six months against the quarterly price changes approved by the previous UPA government based on Rangarajan committee recommendation.
The first price would be determined on the basis of global prices prevailing between July 2013 and June 30, 2014. This would come into effect from November 2014, and would be valid till March 2015.
The price would then be revised for the next six months ending September 2015 on the basis of prices prevalent between January 2014 and December, 2014. The prices would be announced 15 days in advance of the half year.
The Rangarajan formula would have resulted in gas prices rising to $8.4.
Sarraf said yesterday's decison of the Cabinet will incentivise more exploration and production.
The clause that a premium will be paid for gas discoveries henceforth made in deepwater and ultra-deepsea as well as high temperature, high pressure finds, will attract investments , he said.
The revised gas price would be applicable to all gas produced from nomination fields given to ONGC and OIL India, New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP) blocks, some pre-NELP blocks and coal-bed methane blocks.
The new prices would not apply to small and isolated fields in nomination blocks and those pre-NELP blocks where government approval has not been provided under the production sharing contract.

ET View: Modi continues to be king | Blog: It’s a vote for change not for ModiOctober 19, 2014, 11:54 am IST TK Arun in Cursor | India , Times View | ET
33
The election results from Haryana and Maharashtra are positive affirmation of Modi’s continuing grip on the electorate’s imagination. The Modi wave has swept through Haryana, demolishing the Congress, the Indian National Lok Dal and two other parties that do not now even deserve to be listed by name. From a strength of 4 seats in the 90 member Haryana house, the BJP has now acquired a majority on its own, thanks primarily to Modi’s personal appeal. The BJP does not even have a recognisable leader in Haryana.
In Maharashtra, the BJP story is less compelling, although impressive. The BJP has emerged as the single largest party but falls short of a majority. In fact, if the non-BJP parties want to spite the BJP, they can form a government with Sena at the helm and the others in alliance or offering outside support.
But Modi has conclusively demonstrated that his judgment that the BJP has become more popular than the Shiv Sena and deserves to be the dominant partner in their alliance has been vindicated. The party’s vote share has doubled to about 32% and the credit legitimately goes to Modi than to any regional leader of the party.
However, the stridency of his attack on the Sena during the campaign shows that Modi believed that the BJP would get a majority on its own. That gamble has not paid off. Now, he would have to make that phone call to Uddhav Thackeray to make peace and form the government it is theirs to form together in Maharashtra. The fact that the Shiv Sena’s Anand Geete continues to be a member of the Union government shows that neither the BJP nor the Sena has any hostility towards the other sharp enough to rule out coming together once again in Maharashtra.
The Maharashtra result is notable for the Congress retaining about 50 seats, even in its current state of being completely discredited, leaderless at the state-level and at the Centre and wholly clueless about how to revive itself after being knocked out in the Lok Sabha elections. This means that a Congress-free India, which the BJP has declared to be its medium-term goal, will be quite tough.
For the BJP, its dependence on one man, their mascot, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased. In the process, it has emerged the largest party in Maharastra, broken the dominance of caste in Haryana politics and positioned itself as a party still on the ascendant.
It is time for the government to Centre to turn its mind to taking the tough decisions such as slashing subsidies and boosting investment in the economy, without having to worry about short-term political costs.

Tech students should hone communication  so...N Chandrasekaran
(Mukherjee said the company…)
MUMBAI: Country's largest software exporter TCS, which is in the process of hiring 25,000 people from the campuses and raise it to 35,000 next fiscal, feels the education institutes must pay special attention to improve communication and soft skills of their students.
"From an improvement point of view, we have been telling institutes that communications and soft skills are something that can be looked at... which will make people a bit more ready," executive vice-president and global head for human resources Ajoy Mukherjee told PTI.
He, however, said TCS, which is arguably one of the biggest hirers at the country's campuses and has over 3.13 lakh headcounts already, is contended with the technical skills of the freshers which it hires.
"If you ask me from a youngster's point of view, when they are coming in they are very much digitally savvy. Technology-wise, given our selection process, we are able to select the right candidates for our requirements," he said.
Mukherjee said the company plans to give offers to 35,000 freshers from 350-400 institutes during FY16, which is 10,000 more than the ones for FY15.
He said the company conducts a dialogue with the heads of the institutes it gives offers and inform them of the need to work on the students' soft skills.
After declaring a 13.2 per cent growth for the July-September quarter profit at Rs 5,244 crore, TCS chief executive and managing director N Chandrasekaran had said that he was bullish about 2015-16.
"Across the sectors, and across markets, we remain very positive. If at all, we are only increasing our investments both in sales and capability building. We have already hired 36,000 (as against targeted 55,000 for FY15)...So, we remain bullish about next year," he had said.
Mukherjee said the growth in business has resulted in the likelihood of the company overshooting its overall hiring target of 55,000 for the current fiscal.
"Look at our volume growth in H1, it has been very good and this (overshooting) is based on that," Mukherjee said, adding that TCS is conservative when it comes to setting targets.
The company reported a volume growth of 6.1 per cent in the September quarter, on a sequential basis.
Of the 25,000 offers made for FY15, Mukherjee said he expects 71-72 per cent freshers to actually join the company this fiscal.
He said the company has undertaken many initiatives to help students, including a portal called 'Campus Commune' which acts as a knowledge sharing platform for the students before they join the company.
The company had a total of 3.13 lakh employees as of September end, out of which 1.03 lakh or 32.7 per cent are women.
Mukherjee said the decision to have a greater number of women in the workforce is a conscious one taken from having the diversity among the staff.
He, however, refused to share a hierarchical break-up of the women employees and restricted himself to state that in the past few years, the number of women in the mid-and top- management is improving.
The company also does not have a target on the number or percentage of the working staff when it comes to women, it said.

Manipuri student attacked in Bangalore  3 arrestedManipuri student attacked in Bangalore, 3 arrested
Sudipto Mondal , Hindustan Times  Bangalore, October 15, 2014

In a suspected case of hate crime, Bengaluru police arrested three men on Wednesday who reportedly assaulted a Manipuri student with rocks for not speaking the local language.

T Michael Lamjathang Haokip was attacked a little after midnight in a part of the city mostly inhabited by migrants, particularly students from the northeast states and Africa. The 26-year-old received wounds to his head and back but doctors said he was out of danger.
People from India’s seven northeast states are frequently singled out for abuse in other parts of the country because they look different and often dress different, say social scientists. More than 30,000 people from the Northeast fled Bengaluru in August 2012 after a handful of such attacks sparked rumours of a larger conspiracy.
“They kept asking me to speak in Kannada. They said, ‘If you outsiders know how to eat food that is produced in Karnataka, you must also know to speak Kannada. This is India not China.’ I tried to reason with them but they were hysterical,” a profusely bleeding Michael told Hindustan Times at the Kothanur police station.
Two of Michael’s friends – Ngamkholen Haokip, 28, and Rocky Kipgen, 25 – who were with him when he was assaulted on Wednesday escaped with minor wounds.

Michael said the people who gathered because of the commotion immediately sided with the attackers.
“A friend from my community, Letmang Haokip, 35, was passing by on his motorcycle. I jumped onto the bike and we started racing towards the police station. But the people followed us on their bikes and one of them crashed into us. We fell down and I started running for my life towards the police station. Just then a police patrol car arrived and the mob scattered,” he said.
Letmang, who could not leave his motorcycle behind and escape, said the mob snatched valuables and the bike’s documents from him. “They would have probably killed me but Michael returned with the police.”
Obed Haokip, 46, one of Michael’s friends who arrived with a police patrol team, said some associates of a local politician helped a few of the attackers escape.
“Three persons have been arrested and investigations are on to ascertain if this was a hate crime,” said additional commissioner of police Alok Kumar.
Boxer MC Mary Kom, who hails from Manipur and was in Bengaluru for an event, also condemned the incident.
“There should be unity and peace in our country, so that such incidents don’t repeat again,” the Olympic medallist said.

Nearly 64% vote in Maharashtra  highest-ever 76% turnout in HaryanaAfter remaining sluggish for the most part of the day, voting gathered pace in Maharashtra in the afternoon, with the polling percentage crossing 63.4% by 6pm.

Voters in Mumbai came out to exercise their right in the afternoon taking the polling percentage in the capital to 48% till 5pm, according to reports.
Polling started on a brisk note, slowed down around noon but again picked up, officials said.
Haryana, on the other hand, registered an record-breaking turnout figure, with the polling percentage reaching all-time high of 75.9. 
In 1967, maximum polling of 72.65% had taken place in Haryana, while in 1968, minimum polling of 57.26% was registered. In the 2009 elections, 72.37% polling was recorded.
The state had a very slow start in the morning especially in the urban areas. Stray incidents of violence marked the assembly polls in Haryana leaving 32 persons including 10 policemen injured.
While longer queues were seen in rural areas in Maharashtra , the low turnout in urban areas , especially in the rural areas prompted political leaders and celebrities to appeal to people to come out and vote.
Report of stray violence came from as a group of Maoists opened fire on a polling party at Maskipalli in Chamorshi tehsil in Gadchiroli district. "The policemen posted at the polling centre promptly returned the fire and the encounter is still going on," Gadchiroli police PRO said. Further details are awaited.
Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, and film actors Salman Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rekha and Bomman Irani came out to vote in the morning, and urged Mumbai's citizens to come out in larger numbers.
"Go vote, " tweeted Salman Khan, adding that people who were enjoying a picnic without going to vote would be the ones who would complain the most later on. 
Among the political leaders in Maharashtra who have voted so far are Sharad Pawar, and Ajit Pawar from the NCP, Devendra Fadnavis from the BJP, former home minister Sushilkumar Shinde and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan and MNS chief Raj Thackeray.
"I am confident that people will choose Congress this time also for the work done in last 15 years," Prithviraj Chavan said after casting his vote in Karad.
 
"There has been a change in the government at the Centre, major alliances have ended, and all political parties are taking their chances in this poll," he said.
The high turnout for the assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra indicates "polling against Congress misrule", BJP said as it claimed that it would form the government in the two states after winning a decisive mandate from the voters.
 
"We claim that these polling trends are in favour of BJP and we will form governments with absolute majority in both Maharashtra and Haryana.
 
"This heavy polling is against the Congress misrule and corruption and in favour of BJP's good governance and development and credible leadership," BJP general secretary JP Nadda told reporters in Delhi.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi  tweeted,  urging voters in both states to come out and vote. "Youngsters should show the way and ensure a  high voter turnout.
The polls are a major test as much of Modi’s personal charisma as his party’s strategy to abandon long-standing allies in search of political majority in two key states.
Just ahead of the elections, the BJP snapped its 25-year old alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and parted ways with Kuldeep Bishnoi's Haryana Janhit Congress in Haryana.
A victory will not only reaffirm Modi’s appeal with voters but also silence detractors of his new party leadership, which was blamed for a string of defeats in assembly by-elections that tempered the euphoria of his Lok Sabha triumph.

Centre fires up growth with fuel reforms  deregulates diesel priceCentre fires up growth, deregulates diesel price
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 18, 2014
First Published: 19:34 IST(18/10/2014) | Last Updated: 15:38 IST(19/10/2014)
The Modi government unveiled its biggest reform so far on Saturday, aligning diesel prices with international crude oil costs, a move that will make the key fuel cheaper by Rs. 3.37 a litre and help control inflation.
People agree that market-determined diesel prices free of administrative control would cut subsidies.
The bold decision was aided by a fall in global oil prices to near four-year lows, making for the first domestic diesel price cut since January 2009.
Diesel is the fuel most used in the road transport of goods across the length and breadth of India. Ideally, lower freight costs would push food prices down, creating the space for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates, making home loans cheaper  and sparking an economic revival.

“Henceforth, like petrol, pricing of diesel will be market determined,” Finance minister Arun Jaitley said after a cabinet meeting. Like petrol, diesel prices will change every fortnight.
The government also decided to re-launch the direct benefit transfer scheme for cooking gas and link it with the new bank accounts opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
Jaitley said that the programme would be implemented “in a mission mode” between November 10 and January 1, 2015 and that those who lacked bank accounts would continue to receive subsidised LPG gas cylinders.

— ANI (@ANI_news) October 18, 2014
“Hon’ble PM launched bigticket reforms today;lucky that major reforms began with PNG sector;interest of poor & common men was central in them,” Dharmendra Pradhan, Petroleum minister, tweeted.
Diesel prices were raised by 50 paisa on September 1 and cumulatively risen by Rs. 11.81 per litre in 19 instalments since January 2013.
A cut in these prices leads to a lower subsidy bill and will eventually help the government cut taxes on petro products. This, in turn, will help cushion the shocks when global crude prices rise. India imports two-thirds of its energy needs.
Inflation is already falling.  Wholesale inflation rate plunged to 2.38% in September, the lowest in five years, while retail inflation fell to 6.46%, the lowest since 2012, aided by a sharp drop in vegetable and petrol prices.

Market-determined diesel prices could also prompt more companies to take up  fuel retailing. It will also help contain the fiscal deficit --— a measure of the amount the government borrows to fund its expenses—at the budgeted level of 4.1% of GDP in 2014-15.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan recently called on the government to “seize this moment”, while inflation is the lowest in five years and refiners are selling at a profit for the first time ever.
“This was long overdue," said Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry.
Petrol and diesel prices were first deregulated in April 2002 when the AB Vajpayee-led NDA government was in power. State price controls, however, made a back-door entry in 2004 when global crude prices started inching up.
In June 2010 the UPA government freed petrol prices and in January 2013 the UPA government decided to deregulate diesel prices in a staggered manner by raising its prices by 50 paise a litre.

Falling oil prices shaking up global economiesFalling oil prices shake up global economies
AP Oct 16, 2014, 01.27PM IST

global economies
(The global price of oil is…)
NEW YORK: A sudden plunge in the price of oil is sending economic and political shockwaves around the world. Oil exporting countries are bracing for potentially crippling budget shortfalls and importing nations are benefiting from the lowest prices in four years.
The global price of oil is $84 per barrel, down $31, or 27 per cent, from its high point for the year. Oil consumption globally is 91 million barrels per day. That means the world's oil producing countries and companies are bringing in as much as $2.8 trillion less in revenue every day _ and consumers, shippers and airlines are saving a comparable amount on gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.
``The problem is that countries get accustomed to a certain level of income, and then spend,'' says Edward Chow, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``It seems like a windfall at first but when it lasts long enough you get used to it.''
The global price of oil was relatively stable for nearly four years, averaging $110 per barrel. Increased production in the US, Canada, Iraq and elsewhere made up for declining supplies in nations such as Iran and Libya and helped meet rising global demand.
That delicate balance has been upended by a weaker global economy. Demand is slowing while production, particularly in the US, continues to surge.
Consumer-driven economies benefit. For example, drivers in the US are paying the lowest gasoline prices since 2011, giving them more money to spend.
In general the plunge in prices is good for those who have to buy fuel, and bad for those who sell it. But it has far wider and more complex effects on economies around the globe that are only starting to be felt.
MAJOR EXPORTERS
OPEC countries and other major exporters will feel the biggest impact. The cash-strapped governments of Russia, Venezuela and Iraq are among the most vulnerable.
Oil is cheap to produce in these countries, so they still make money at lower prices. But their government budgets are based on expectations of oil prices of $100 or more.
On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed concern that lower oil prices could force the government to cut spending. Researchers at the state-owned Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, estimate that the country needs an oil price of over $104 per barrel to balance its budget next year.
In Venezuela, the government leans heavily on oil revenue to fund spending on housing projects, community organizing and other social programs. Now, oil production is falling at a time when the country desperately needs cash. This month, the analysis firm Stratfor Global estimated that Venezuela needs oil at $110 to continue meeting its obligations.
Last week, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Rafael Ramirez called for an emergency OPEC meeting to allow member countries cut production to keep prices above $100.
  Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter and OPEC's most influential member, might not rush to cut production, however, even though it would start running a deficit with oil at $85 per barrel, according to Merrill Lynch. With a large reserve fund _ estimated to be $700 billion _ it could withstand a longer period of lower prices.
Saudi Arabia may be interested in using lower prices to force Western oil companies to cut back on some less profitable production in an effort to secure market share.
Iraq is counting on rising revenue both from high oil prices and increasing production to help it fight the insurgency gripping the country and recover from war. Revenue may now fall instead.
ASIA
The picture is reversed in Asia, where most countries are major importers and some subsidize the price of fuels.
China is the second-largest oil consumer and on track to become the largest net importer of oil. Falling prices will provide China's economy some relief, according to Huang Bingjie, professor from the School of Economics and Management at China University of Petroleum. But lower oil prices won't fully offset the far wider effects of a slowing economy.
India imports three-quarters of its oil and analysts say falling oil prices will ease the country's chronic current account deficit. Samiran Chakraborty, head of research in India for Standard Chartered Bank, also says the cost of India's fuel subsidies would fall by $2.5 billion during its current fiscal year if oil prices stay low.
Japan imports nearly all of the oil it uses. Following the accident at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant in 2011, Japan has turned more to oil and natural gas, which is priced based on oil, to generate electric power. But the lower prices are a mixed blessing. Rising energy prices have helped to push inflation higher _ a key aim of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's deflation-fighting ``Abenomics'' growth strategy.
NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, AND EUROPE
Low prices could eventually threaten the boom in oil production in such countries as the US, Canada, and Brazil because that oil is expensive to produce. Investors have dumped shares of energy companies in recent weeks, helping to drag global stock markets lower.
For now, lower crude oil and fuel prices are a boon for consumers. In the US, still the world's biggest oil user, consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the US economy, and lower energy prices give consumers more money to spend on things other than fuel.
The same is true in Europe. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, says that a 10 per cent fall in oil prices would lead to a 0.1 per cent increase in economic output. That's meaningful because the 18-country currency union didn't grow at all in the second quarter.

BSNL cuts call rates to Nepal by 35 per cent as PMO raises issue

(BSNL has launched a special…)
NEW DELHI: State-owned BSNL has reduced call rates to Nepal by about 35 per cent as the Prime Minister's Office had raised the issue of high call charges to the neighbouring country with the Department of Telecom .
BSNL has launched a special tariff voucher (STV) of Rs 18 which allows people to call Nepal at Rs 6.50 paisa per minute against a normal rate of Rs 10 per minute.
Private players including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone charge Rs 12 a minute for calls to Nepal.
DoT held a meeting with telecom players recently to discuss the matter wherein operators complained that Nepal charges very high termination rates for their calls which result in high rates.
BSNL said with Rs 6.50 paisa call, the company is making a profit of just 50 paisa on each call as the rest goes into paying taxes, termination charges, spectrum fees and so on.
The issue was raised after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Nepal in August wherein people complained about high call rates to the Himalayan nation from India.
The PMO then wrote a letter to DoT to discuss the issue with telecom operators. The DoT has already held a meeting with telcos. Another meeting is scheduled to take place in a few weeks.
Industry body COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews said some kind of regulatory intervention is required to address the issue as Nepal is charging very high termination charges whereas the Indian operators are charging just about 40 paisa.
Other SAARC countries are also charging high termination rates for calls landing on their networks.
"We had a meeting in DoT recently on PMO's letter regarding the call rates to Nepal and after that we have launched this STV which is effective since October 15," BSNL Director (consumer mobility) Anupam Shrivastava said.
He added that the company plans to launch such STVs for other SAARC countries also in near future.

When Shah Rukh Khan became SitaWhen Shah Rukh Khan was submitting his college form, the man behind the counter asked him, “Naam?”
“Shah Rukh Khan,” said Shah Rukh Khan.
“Achcha? Lagte toh nahi ho,” the man guffawed.
Shah Rukh sheepishly smiled. 
Pretty in pink: Shah Rukh Khan dressed up as Sita in the  green room. Wigs, costumes, masks and props hang on the walls.
Meet Shah Rukh Khan, a 19-year-old BCom student at BR Ambedkar University in Agra. Welcome to the Ramlila organised by the Uttar Madhya Railway Sansthan in Agra. And here’s the connection between the two: Shah Rukh Khan played the role of Sita in the Ramlila in Agra this year.
He’d much rather have been Lakshman (because Ram is too much work) or his favourite Raavan (the role is unavailable, though). But since this is an all-male cast, he was selected to play Sita. Laments a fellow actor, who has played small female roles in the Ramlila, “When our Missus’ buy new lipsticks, they tell us, ‘Let me try it out on you first! If you wear it on stage, why can’t you wear some here?’”
Also read: A look at the greatest Ramlila in the world
But Shah Rukh, with his youthful, slender frame, does look good as Sita. “Magar Sitaji toh gori thi, kaali kaise ho gayi?” the boys tease him. They all miss their old Sita – the gora-chitta Bimal Verma (who now plays King Dasharath) had been Sita for nearly a decade before that.
But then – Verma points to his paunch – “My body changed.” The role went to Hanif, a Muslim boy, three years ago. And this made headlines in local newspapers. When Hanif moved out of Agra, Sita’s spot was once again open. And for the spotlight to remain trained on the Ramlila, it needed Shah Rukh Khan.
 
It happened one night
Shah Rukh by any other name may not have been Sita.
Rakesh Kannojia, the organiser of this Ramlila, is also a local reporter. “We needed someone with good character, a good face and a good reputation in society,” he says. So he landed up at the Khan residence. “And when I saw Shah Rukh, I thought he’d look good as Sita. And I asked him, ‘Sita banega?’”
“It’s not such a big deal,” says Shah Rukh’s elder sister Nazeena. “It’s just a play after all.”
The Khans don’t understand what the fuss is all about. But there have been some entertaining moments. Like the time the actor playing Raavan visited their house. “A neighbour took papa aside and warned him to be careful,” says Nazeena. “He told my father: ‘Raavan has seen where Sita lives. What if he decides to kidnap her earlier than planned?’”
All these jokes are refreshing at any rate, for a boy who has been plagued with jokes because of his name. He’s not wild about being called Shah Rukh. Many of his college friends don’t even know his real name, but, encouraged by Shah Rukh, call him ‘Rehan’. One day when they dropped by to see him, his mother turned them away because “Nobody called Rehan lives here”.
Mashhoor ramlila
This, the “second most famous Ramlila of Agra” (for the “most famous” head to the city’s Ramlila Maidan) is held in grounds adjacent to the railway station, in Agra Cantonment. “Thousands of people – railway workers, army officers  and travellers waiting for the next train – watch it every year.” 
We’re here for a weekend, for the Swayamvar episode where Ram and Sita finally wed. This is Shah Rukh’s first performance as Sita, albeit without any dialogues. He’s dressed in a bright pink sari, decked up in costume jewellery and his face has been appropriately painted, made up and doused with sparkly glitter.
He coyly steps on to the stage and garlands Ram. They pose for photographs, the crowd cheers. Some kids in the front row whistle, their parents reprimand them.
This is not very different from any other Ramlila, but with such a strong flavour of the hinterland, it seems to belong in an Anurag Kashyap film.
Ram rajya: Sita garlands Ram. Shah Rukh would like to play Lakshman (because being Ram requires too much work)
The dialogues are dramatic, costumes are elaborate and the acting, surprisingly, par excellence. Disco lights flash neon colours, and in between scenes, kids from the neighbourhood step on to the stage to “perform an item.” Or large speakers blare devotional lyrics set to Bollywood tunes.  
“This is the only railway Ramlila in the world,” one man tells us. “Arre, world nahi, India,” says another. “Uttar Pradesh,” clarifies a third. They look at one another. “Second most famous Ramlila of Agra,” they repeat.
The making of SRK
When he met us, Shah Rukh had already been interviewed by a dozen reporters. But Shah Rukh wasn’t always Shah Rukh.
In the Nineties, his brother went to watch an SRK film, became an instant fan and decided to foist the name on him. He’d follow the baby around calling him ‘Shah Rukh, Shah Rukh.” 
Nicknames usually die out, or are replaced for official purposes by a ‘real’ name – but, like ‘Gogol’ in Jhumpa Lahiri’s novel, The Namesake, Shah Rukh stuck and became his real name. 
Ironically, Shah Rukh’s brother no longer likes Shah Rukh Khan. More ironically still, Shah Rukh doesn’t like Shah Rukh Khan, the name or the Bollywood namesake. He is a diehard Salman fan.
“Kick toh badhiya lagi. Magar meri sabse favourite Salman picture hai Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam,” he says. And after much prodding, he admits he liked Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, “but only because you ask.”

Next Maharashtra CM will be from BJP: JavadekarComments
With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) needing support to form the government in Maharashtra, it ruled out a tie-up with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), while keeping its options open on reviving its alliance with the Shiv Sena.
Three hours after counting, BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar insisted that irrespective of prospective alliances, the next Maharashtra chief minister will be from the BJP ranks.
"We fought Congress and NCP, their corruption. We brought out skeletons of corruption from their cupboards. There is no question of allying with NCP," Union minister Prakash Javadekar, a leader from Maharashtra, said.

It will be an insult to us and voters, he said when asked aut possibility of BJP allying with NCP to form the government.
When told that the BJP will have to tie up with another party, probably the Shiv Sena, since it does not have numbers on its own, Javadekar said, "The party will take a final decision,” he said.
According to political sources, channels of communication opened up between BJP and Sena late on Saturday, following statements from senior leaders of both parties that they will join hands to come to power if necessary.
“Our ideological fight was against the NCP and Congress and Sena is our natural ally. It is true that we are hurt because of the things Sena said about our party and PM Modi,” state president Devendra Fadanvis said as the leads were declared. Fadnavis along with senior leaders Om Mathur and Vinod Tawde convened meetings at the BJP headquarters on Sunday morning.

Amid indications of a hung assembly, the Shiv Sena on Sunday said the next Maharashtra chief minister will be Uddhav Thackeray.
"Whatever happens, the next chief minister would be Sena president Uddhav Thackeray," said party spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut as the results started pouring in.
"In politics, we cannot disclose all the cards right now. We shall make our stand clear this evening," Raut added.
This could put a dampener on ex-ally BJP's efforts to reach out to them. The BJP appeared set to be the single largest party, with majority eluding it in the 288-member house.

State election results  Q2 earnings key for markets: ExpertsExit polls
(Results of Assembly elections…)
NEW DELHI: Results of Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana and second quarter earnings of blue- chips such as HDFC, Wipro and HDFC Bank would dictate stock market trend in a holiday-shortened week ahead, say experts.
Stock markets will remain closed on Thursday on account of Diwali Laxmi Pujan and on Friday for Diwali Balipratipada.
However, stock exchanges will conduct a special trading session on Thursday for muhurat trading on Diwali.
Market movement in near-term will depend upon the result of elections held in Maharashta and Haryana.
Results of assembly elections in these two states will be announced today.
Exit polls have predicted BJP would gain majority in recently-held Maharashtra and Haryana assembly polls .
Among major earnings this week are from companies such as HDFC Bank, Cairn India, Punjab National Bank, HDFC and Wipro.
"In this holiday shortened week, participants would be eyeing results of some big names including Cairn India, HDFC Bank, Punjab National Bank, Kotak Bank, Wipro among others," said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities.
Investment trend by overseas investors, movement of rupee against the dollar and crude oil price will also be key for stocks.
Meanwhile, signs of anxiety over global growth and fears over spread of Ebola virus may hurt market sentiment.
"Indian markets are expected to tread cautiously amid renewed worries over the European debt crisis. Better than expected earnings could provide an upsurge while global worries could prove to be a dampener. Crude tumbling to record lows and CPI easing up are positives for India, which should help equities trade up," said Aman Chowdhury, CEO and Co-Founder, Cians Analytics.
On a weekly basis, the Sensex fell for the fourth straight week and lost 188.85 points.
"We believe, although fundamentals are somewhat lagging the prices currently, the markets are looking robust and poised for stronger rally from here provided global worries with respect to Fed's stimulus rollback do not disturb the FII mood over emerging markets," said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.
Jignesh Chaudhary, Head Of Research, Veracity Broking Services said, "Markets will take huge cues from results of two states assembly elections in which according to exit polls BJP is strong amongst all and would form government in the states of Haryana and Maharashtra which would be taken as positive news for the reforms."

We will take Kashmir from India: Bilawal BhuttoAsif Ali Zardari
("We will take back Kashmir…)
KARACHI: In a fresh rant against India, Pakistan People's Party chief Bilawal Bhutto vowed to wrest Kashmir from India.
"When I raise Kashmir, the entire Hindustan screams. They know when a Bhutto speaks, they (Indians) have no answer," the 26-year-old Bhutto scion said during his first public rally here yesterday.
"We will take back Kashmir from India," he said amidst thundering applause by thousands of supporters at mausoleum of Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah .
The next gen politician said that Kashmir would become part of Pakistan but they would not let anyone make India-Pakistan negotiations hostage in the name of Kashmir issue. He said he was also seeking peace in Kashmir and his statements over Kashmir should not be misunderstood.
Bilawal, who is being portrayed as the future Prime Minister, said the Indian government and media were trying to malign PPP's image and muzzle its voice since it is "the only Pakistani party whose voice is heard around the world".
It is second time Bilawal has talked about Kashmir in public.
Last month he had said the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) if voted to power will take back every inch of Kashmir from India.
"I will take back Kashmir, all of it, and I will not leave behind a single inch of it because, like the other provinces, it belongs to Pakistan," he had said.
Bilawal, who formally launched his political career, promised to revamp the party which is under criticism for ignoring the poor class and peasants considered its backbone.
Bilawal is son of former two-time premier Benazir Bhutto who was assassinated in 2007. Bilawal's father Asif Ali Zardari was president from 2008 to 2013.
Opinions are divided over prospects of Bilawal's success as he still under the shadow of his father who faced charges of corruption in the past and is known for doling out favours to close friends.

Hack-o-lantern helps you have a high-tech…Matthew Zahnzinger
October 18, 2014
In today’s modern, innovative society, nothing is safe from the march of technology… not even jack-o’-lanterns. This year, LittleBits offers consumers the tech necessary to geek out and turn what could be a humdrum holiday into the Halloween of the future.
Well, sort of.
For those who aren’t already familiar with LittleBits, it’s a modular DIY platform designed to make experimentation with electronics accessible to tinkerers of all skill levels. The company's website gives examples ranging from chicken feed monitors to cyber DJs.
To get into the seasonal spirit, LittleBits is serving up three distinct Halloween kits: Hack-o-Lantern , Creepy Portrait , and… Stick Figure Costume ? (Titles are clearly not their strong point.)
As with everything on the LittleBits website, the product is just the electronics modules. You'll need additional materials to realize your high-tech Halloween dreams. This is not an all-inclusive kit that comes with everything you need.
Hack-o-Lantern
The Hack-o-Lantern, for instance, uses a sound triggered sensor to light up when it hears a sound. This could be a fun addition to your front porch, but $29 only pays for the module; you'll have to provide your own carved pumpkin.
Creepy Portrait
As for the Creepy Portrait module, you'll pay $59 for the motion sensor and servo combo, which will cause the eyes of a seemingly regular portrait to turn evil (ie: red). Above the initial asking price, you'll need to actually get a portrait, frame it, mount it, cut out the eyes (and the evil alter-eyes), etc.
Stick Figure Costume
Lastly, the Stick Figure Costume is… well, a bunch of light wire sewn into an article of clothing, whether it’s a hoody, t-shirt, or what have you. The kit comes with the wire, a power nodule, and a pulse attachment to turn you from a walking glow stick into a walking nightclub.
So, that last one’s not so good (seriously, just go out and get an actual costume), but the other two seem like fun, spooky final touches for your Halloween decor.
The most important thing to keep in mind with any of the LittleBits kits? These are perfect for people who love to mess around with electronics, but not for someone looking for easy plug-and-play decoration solutions. But with some creative DIY-ing and a curious mind, these Halloween kits are fun packages to spice up your fall holiday—as long as you know what you’re getting yourself into.
More Halloween DIY
Looking for other ideas? Consider turning your pumpkin into a Tetris arcade .

CBI identifies two conspirators in Saradha scam

(The Special Crime Branch…)
KOLKATA: The Special Crime Branch of CBI, probing the Saradha scam , has identified two conspirators and is collecting evidences against them.
"After interrogating several persons so far, we have been able to identify two conspirators who are politically influential and not questioned by the agency till now," agency sources said.
Once the CBI is convinced with the nature of the evidences collected, the agency will legally start proceedings against them.
"We want to go forward on a solid footing and our intention is not to create any sensation whatsoever," the sources said.
The CBI, unlike the ED, has started the probe just over four months ago on the direction of the Supreme Court .
Because of the voluminous nature of the probe, the agency will take a fair amount of time to complete the probe, the sources said.
The CBI is preparing its first charge sheet against Saradha Tours & Travels which will probably be filed by the end of this month, the sources said.
The CBI, which is looking into the criminal conspiracy angle of the scam, has collated several documents in the course of investigations.
"I cannot say whatever is collected is all foolproof. But we are analysing all sorts of data which are provided to us," the sources said.
Alleging that the West Bengal government is going slow on providing the land records documents of the arrested Saradha chief Sudipto Sen, the sources said, "We had asked the land records department of the state government to provide us the details of Sudipto Sen's holdings".
The government has been giving information on a piecemeal basis and is yet to furnish it completely, the sources said.
Regarding painter Suvaprasanna, who was quizzed by the CBI regarding his transactions with Sen, the sources said, "He is saying that he does not remember the financial details which are looked by others."
"We need to get clarifications from him and he has to give all the details," the sources said.
Suvaprasanna, considered close to Trinamool Congress , sold his TV channel to Saradha group's Sen.

India to go ahead with construction of highway in ArunachalDespite Chinese concern, India to go ahead with its plan of construction of frontier highway in Arunachal Pradesh
Bikash Singh, ET Bureau Oct 18, 2014, 04.45PM IST

Assam
GUWAHATI: With China expressing concern over India's plan to construct frontier highway along the McMohan line in Arunachal Pradesh, Union minister of state for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju said that the India has all the right to create critical infrastructure in its area.
The minister also informed that government will relax rules in the restricted area permit (RAP) for encouraging tourism in different pockets of Northeast India.
Rijiju who was in Guwahati to participate in a programme of PHD chamber of commerce said, "We are at freedom to construct highway in our territory. We are not harming neighbours interest. We have to develop our territories, especially those areas which are neglected for too long time. We are going to develop our own region."
India plans to construct roads linking Mago-Thingbu in Tawang to Vijaynagar in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. The 2,000-km long road is expected t cost Rs 40,000 crore. India plans frontier highway in its border. Northeast India shares border with China, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar.
The minister said, "We are not venturing into others territory. Its is our domain. Other countries should not have any objection when we are not doing anything harmful to them," Rijiju said.
He continued, "We are not doing anything which is adverse to the interest of our neighbours. Whatever is being done, it is for our own people and for the connectivity of our own people living in border areas."
China sharply reacted to India's plans to construct a road network along the McMohan line inArunachal Pradesh and expressed hope that India will not take any action which may complicate the situation before a final settlement is reached to end the boundary dispute.
The MHA will relax the Restricted area permit for some pockets in Northeast India which required by foreigners to visit certain parts of North East. "We have decided to relax the norms of Protected Area Permit. I have discussed it with my senior ministers,. The foreign affairs department of his ministry is working on it."
"Relaxation of visa, permission to travel from one place to another in North East and any other issues, you will get all support from us to promote tourism in the region. However, the relaxation will not be a blanket one for the entire region."
He added that "North East has the highest numbers of insurgents, student groups and autonomous state demands in the world. Demanding is not their problem, its their right. We have to admit that we have faltered. Governments in region have to realise that they have failed.
On the arrest of six operative of Jamaat- ul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) Assam in connection the explosion on October 2 in a house at Khagragarh in Burdwan town in West Bengal, he said he will not say anything as the matter is under investigation.
Rijiju said "any place, any fundamental activities to the extreme are disturbing. We have to contain that kind of forces anywhere in the country. We are checking everything and we are ensuring that it does not go beyond a point... There are reports and we are very careful now."
The minister also pointed out that he is not in favour of against of big dams in North East and favoured smaller ones with 300-500 MW capacities. "Traditionally I am not for big hydro power projects in North East. I am not in favour of 4,000 MW or 5,000 MW projects. I am fine if one or two big projects of 3000 MW or 4000 MW come up in the region with consultations with the public.
He said that NHPC has lost Rs 7,000 crore due to delay in the commissioning of 2000 MW Lower Subansari project along Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border. Work in the project site has come to a halt since last two years after anti dam protest. He explained that if a country's Mini-Ratna category PSU like NHPC is facing a situation like this, then it is a very serious issue.
Union minister of State for Home said the Centre will look into the issue of NGOs getting foreign money and creating obstruction in construction of the project. Power ministry is talking to different groups.
He said government in Arunachal Pradesh has messed up the power. "One should not call Arunachal Pradesh power house as there is not enough power there and state has to purchase from Assam to meet its electricity demand. I met the chief minister, Nabam Tuki requested to expedite power projects and not to just have MOUs.

CHENNAI: The Madras High Court today declined to stay a single judge's order that quashed a stop work order issued by the State PWD Department on the Rs.374 crore Tiruchi-Karaikudi National Highways project.
A division bench comprising justices Satish K. Agnihotri and K K Sasidharan , before which the state government's appeal came up, ordered issue of notice to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on the plea.
Earlier, the single judge, who heard the petition filed by NHAI against the government order restraining the Authority from continuing with the work on the project, had stayed it. The government had filed the appeal following this.
The project, which would link six national highway stretches in the region, involves construction of a two-lane path with paved shoulders on the Tiruchi-Karaikudi section of NH-210. The 84km stretch includes 25km of the Tiruchi bypass on NH-67.
Launched in 2010, the project was to be completed by May 14, 2013.

BEIJING: After attracting Chinese investments to its industrial parks, India today pitched for China's participation in Special Economic Zones (SEZ).
At a round table with local investors, an Indian delegation comprising senior officials from Commerce Ministry and SEZ developers, discussed the SEZ framework in the country and specific opportunities in select economic zones.
The six-member delegation is the first from India after President Xi Jinping visited New Delhi last month during which $ 20 billion commitment was made by China to invest in industrial parks in Gujarat and Maharashtra.
In the meeting, Indian Ambassador to China, Ashok Kantha asked Chinese companies to build on the successful visit of Xi to India and the launch of 'Make in India' campaign, aimed at ensuring investor-friendly environment for businessmen in the country.
He said that apart from the two industrial parks announced in Maharashtra and Gujarat, Chinese companies could consider investing through the SEZ route which offers a viable option.
The delegation, led by Madhusudan Prasad, Additional Secretary in charge of Special Economic Zones, included senior officials from the Ministry of Finance and SEZ developers such as Sricity Private Limited, Mahindra Life Spaces and SIPCOT Tamil Nadu, according to a statement by Indian Embassy here.
The round table discussion on 'Investing in India's SEZs' was attended by 40 participants.
The Indian delegation will also meet the officials of Chinese Ministry of Commerce and visit Tianjin, Shanghai and Suzhou.
The Indian Embassy will also organise investment promotion seminars in other cities including Qingdao and Chongqing next month.

Battle of the fitness bandsprint
Techilicious columnist Rajiv Makhni
The Fitness and wearable band euphoria is getting stronger every day. Despite news about waning interest and the fact that a lot of people stop using one after six months, the number of people who are buying and strapping them on is on an upswing.
And surprisingly it’s here in India that a serious demand is being felt. I have a crude but very accurate system to gauge what category of products are experiencing a definitive uptick.
It’s the number of people who ask me “which one to buy” whenever I’m out in a public place. (To all those asking – yes, most of my life is spent answering questions from people I meet  about which new device to buy. No, it’s not a sad life!).
So right after ‘aaj-kal kaunsa mobile aacha hai?’ and ‘TV kaunse brand ka kharidna chahiye?’, the next hot category being asked about is fitness bands.  Previously the problem in answering this burning hot question was the unavailability of these bands in India.
Fitbit started it all off but never made it to Indian shores. The Nike Fuelband followed and is now all dead and buried, but never popped up here in its short life.
 
The Jawbone Up is available in pretty much every country in the world except here (there is poetic justice here as this is one device that has turned out to be quite a disaster). The Misfit Shine is still a ‘foreign trip par hi khareed sakte ho’ device and there is a plethora of others that haven’t been officially launched in India.
Move it, Move it: If Garmin Vivo senses no activity from you, the Move bar starts to add up. Your goal is to keep the
Move bar off the screen, by moving
There are quite a few no-name Chinese knock-offs but I always ask people to steer clear  of them as a fitness band is about its ecosystem, the app and software, as much as it is about the band itself.
Thus there weren’t any real options for people who wanted to get onto the ‘quantified self’ bandwagon by walking into a store and buying one locally. That has changed with a vengeance as multiple companies have come muscling into our country. So which one should you buy and why?
Garmin Vivo Fit
Garmin is mainly known for its GPS devices and thus the first impression is that this would be a band that can do most things to track your fitness, plus also track your walk and run on a map.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t do that (for that you’ll have to invest into a Garmin Forerunner watch). But it has quite a few other tricks up its wrist strap. Speaking of which, the unit is separate from its plastic strap (a slightly cheap affair) and there are some extra colours available.
The Vivo can track steps, distance, calories, sleep and can calculate a few other things as well. This one has a ‘Move’ bar right on top. If it senses no activity from you, the Move bar in red starts to add up.
Running right: GOQii sends your data to a human coach, who analyses it and gives you real time feedback
our goal is to keep the Move bar off the screen, by, well, moving. And it works very well (you will find yourself doing some office jigs and dances to get rid of that red line).
The second big deal is its battery life which is about one full year as it uses button cells. The problems stem from the fact that the screen has no backlighting and that the synch to the connect app can be a little iffy. The Vivo is priced at around Rs.9,000 but you can pick it up cheaper online. 
GOQii
I’ve reviewed the GOQii before and thus won’t get into too much detail. This one can also track steps, distance, calories and sleep and its add on USPs are tracking active minutes per day (when you really were working out hard) and Karma points (earn points and give them away to a worthy cause).
But the game-changing shift is what this device does with all that activity data that it tracks. This data goes straight to a real human personal coach allocated to you who analyses it and gives you real time feedback, advise and directions.
The GOQii coaching system is very robust and professional and can truly motivate and keep you on track. The GOQii device is free and you only pay for the coaching system and there is a special deal on Amazon at Rs.3,999 for three months. 
Mymo
This is a new entry into the the fitness world and comes straight to India after its launch in the Middle East. Its a clip-on device with a six-month battery life, has no screen or visual data that you can track on it (it synchs with an app on your phone for you to see that).
The Mymo is very small and unobtrusive and can track all the metrics you need. It works with Tupelolife, a healthcare ecosystem built around the app. The Mymo is currently available for Rs.3,375 in India.
 
Right on track: Mymo comes with a six month battery life and no screen. It's very small and unobtrusive and tracks all the metrics you need
So which one then?
I’m going to take the Mymo out of the equation right now as it’s a very recent entry and needs time to get things right and develop the ecosystem well. That leaves the Vivo and the GOQii.
The choice is fairly simple. If you believe you are disciplined enough to stick to a fitness regime on your own and can track and analyse all the data being thrown at you – then the Vivo is a very good device.
But if you fall into the category where you fall off your fitness bandwagon regularly, have been struggling to go to the gym every morning, struggling with weight issues and are quite confused as to what to do with all that awesome data about your own body – then GOQii and its personal coach is a life-saver. 
I hope that answers the question ke ‘India mein kaunsa fitness band aacha hai?’

(State-owned life insurer LIC has…)
NEW DELHI: State-owned life insurer LIC has shored up its stake in Infosys to 4.45 per cent, purchasing shares that are worth about Rs 1,400 crore in the July- September quarter.
This is the second consecutive quarter of share purchase by LIC in the software services firm.
While the exact date of share purchased by LIC could not be ascertained, Infosys new CEO and Managing Director Vishal Sikka took charge of the company from August.
Life Insurance Corporation of India, the biggest institutional investor in the stock market, which held 3.25 per cent stake in Infosys during the January-March quarter, has increased holding to 4.45 per cent as of September 30, 2014.
During April-June quarter, LIC had 3.71 per cent stake in the country's second largest software services firm.
The state-run firm has been increasing its holding in Infosys since the January-March quarter.
Prior to that LIC had been reducing its stake in the software company since last year. It held 6.72 per cent stake in IT firm at the end of June 30, 2013, as per the latest data available with the stock exchanges.
Taking into account the current market value of Infosys shares, the 0.63 per cent hike in LIC's holding in the company would be worth about Rs 1,400 crore. Infosys shares closed at Rs 3,853.85 on Friday.
Sikka, the first outsider as well as not part of the co-founder's club to lead the Bangalore-based firm, was the head of technology and innovation department at German software giant SAP.
Also, mentor N R Narayana Murthy stepped down in June four years before his tenure was to end. He was brought back to head the IT major in June last year, following quarters of laggard performance. Since Murthy's return, Infosys had seen 11 top-level exits.
Apart from LIC, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), too, raised their holding in Infosys to 14.48 per cent during the July-September quarter of 2014 from 14.08 per cent in the preceding three months.
Besides, Foreign Institutional Investors raised their exposure in Infosys to 42.67 per cent from 41.58 per cent during the period.

How to work less as you approach retirementHow to Work Less as You Approach Retirement

Some people have managed to save enough to retire , but keep working simply to pad an already flush retirement kitty. While calculations point to the fact that we will be OK financially for the rest of our lives, we keep working just to make our finances a bit more secure. For those suffering from this one more year of work syndrome, here are a few ways you can make life more enjoyable even while you continue to work:
Say no more often. Working 9 to 5 can be extremely stressful because we are constantly being asked to produce more. As more responsibilities, more complications and ultimately more hours are added to our work day, a formerly pleasant job suddenly turns into a miserable grind. When you aren't worried about losing your job because you can afford to stop working entirely, just start saying no. Say no to working weekends and overtime. Say no to uninteresting projects. Even say no to promotions. Obviously, you still need to do a competent job, but there's no need to overdo it just to increase your future career prospects since you aren't looking for better opportunities.
Speak up more at work. Don't let the stress build up anymore and become an advocate for change. See something you don't like at work? Voice your opinion. Take action to fix it . Many people are afraid they will be seen as the person who complains and end up losing their jobs, but people who have enough money in the bank to quit don't need to worry about that anymore. If the worst case scenario happens and you are let go, someone just helped you pull the retirement trigger . But if you are successful with the fix, not only will your life at work be better, but the company will value you more and your peers will thank you too, making your work life a lot more enjoyable.
Take all your vacation and sick days. When was the last time you actually took all of your days off? Use those days to recharge. Schedule an annual checkup, watch a movie and go on a vacation. This might be a good way to test drive your retirement as well, since life without work will be quite boring if you can't even find enough activities to fill up all your vacation and sick days.
Ask for reduced time. Many people never realize that working less than full time with the same employer is possible. This could be the best of both worlds because part-time work can still bring structure to a person's life, not to mention the continuous paycheck that's still coming in to ease the anxiety of living off your savings. And if working part time isn't in the cards, at least ask for more vacation days or days you can spend working at home.
Lower your savings rate a bit and spend more of your salary. Since you are theoretically done saving, it might make working longer more enjoyable if you can spend more of the money you are earning those last few years. Just make sure you are spending on discretionary expenses that can easily be scaled back in retirement. Otherwise, you may get used to the higher standard of living and in turn need to raise the assets needed to support that annual spending, making the amount you have saved not enough anymore.
You don't have to stay on the job once you have enough for retirement, but it's still difficult to give up the security of a steady paycheck. If you decide to stick it out, at least take steps to make your life easier .

Haryana assembly elections: BJP surges ahead in initial roundsBharatiya Janata Party scripts history in Haryana, to form its first govt in state
Hitender Rao , Hindustan Times  Chandigarh, October 19, 2014

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a resounding victory in Haryana on Sunday with an absolute majority of 47 seats in the 90-member assembly, putting it on course to form the party’s first government in the state on its own.

The party cashed in on the strong anti-Jat sentiment after 18 years of successive Jat chief ministers in the state, where the BJP has until now only been a junior partner in the Haryana Vikas Party (HVP) and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) governments.
The BJP is expected to put forward a non-Jat leader’s name for the next chief minister of Haryana. Among the frontrunners for the top post are state BJP chief and senior leader Ram Bilas Sharma, 66, and sangh pracharak from Rohtak, Manohar Lal Khattar, 60, who won his debut election from Karnal with a huge.

Until now, the BJP was a fringe player in Haryana, with just four seats in the previous assembly. It relied on regional entities such as the late Bansi Lal’s HVP and Om Prakash Chautala’s INLD.
The BJP’s aggressive campaigning against political dynasties got a mixed response as the older sons of former chief ministers Bhajan Lal and Bansi Lal lost their seats but most members of the INLD clan managed to win in spite of their party's poor performance.
The dreams of the main opposition INLD, which was seeking to return to power after a decade of wilderness, were dashed, but two of three members of the Om Prakash Chautala family won their seats.
While senior INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala won from Ellenabad, senior leader Ajay Singh Chautala’s wife, Naina, won from Dabwali. She is the first woman from the Devi Lal clan to have contested the polls.

However, Dushyant Chautala, the INLD's Hisar MP and grandson of former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, lost to the BJP’s Prem Lata Singh, the wife of senior saffron party leader Birender Singh, who defeated him from Uchana Kalan.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders, including party chief Amit Shah, had aggressively campaigned in Haryana in the run-up to the polls, asking the voters to put an end to the rule of political dynasties in the state.

The party virtually swept the northern and southern parts of Haryana with 32 seats. The saffron wave was evident in the northern parts from Panchkula district to Panipat district, where the BJP candidates won 21 seats. In southern Haryana, it won 11 seats falling in Gurgaon, Rewari and Mahendergarh districts.
The party’s performance in the Jat heartland of Jind, Hisar, Rohtak, Sonepat, Bhiwani, however, was not impressive. Of the 25 Jat candidates fielded by the party, only six could win.

Hung house in Maharashtra: Scenarios of what might happenPossible scenarios after hung house in Maharashtra

Though the BJP has emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra, the fractured mandate has thrown up different possibilities. Shiv Sena is the BJP’s most likely suitor, though the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) could also have a say. The smaller parties and Independents are unlikely to make up for the BJP’s deficit.
Scenario 1
BJP, expected to finish with around 115 seats, ties up with the Shiv Sena, which was leading in 63 seats at noon. This would mean that the BJP would not be in a commanding position and will have to bargain with the Sena for chief ministership and portfolios.
Scenario 2
BJP ties up with the NCP, which was leading in 43 seats at noon. A number of compromises will be involved if this were to happen, especially given the BJP’s continuous tirade against the NCP over corruption. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said Sunday it will offer legislative support to a BJP government in Maharashtra. Speaking after the election results produced a hung assembly, NCP leader Praful Patel said his party was ready to offer "outside support" to a Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state. The BJP said that it will examine the NCP's offer of outside support to help it form a government in Maharashtra and take a decision on it.

Maharashtra polls: Sena says it will consider BJP proposal on govt formationBJP
(Sena spokesperson Sanjay…)
MUMBAI: Indicating a possible reconciliation, Shiv Sena today said it will consider BJP's proposal on government formation in Maharashtra once it is made as they have "no bitterness".
"Once they (BJP) submit a proposal for a stable government in the interest of Maharashtra, Sena president Uddhav Thackeray will take a decision, whatever that may be, after considering all factors," Sena MP Anil Desai said.
"We have no bitterness. If there is a proposal, we will consider it," Desai, who was part of the failed seat-sharing talks with BJP ahead of the Assembly poll, said.
Amid reports that NCP had sent feelers to BJP for extending support, Desai said, "NCP has been rejected by the people of Maharashtra. If BJP ties up with NCP, it will be a betrayal of the people of Maharashtra."
Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said, "We have seen the trends. They show BJP is getting more seats, which is okay. But Sena is also doing well. I will comment on our stance after a clear picture emerges after 2 PM," Raut said.

Blog: Modi continues to be king | It’s a vote for change not for ModiOctober 19, 2014, 11:54 am IST TK Arun in Cursor | India , Times View | ET
33
The election results from Haryana and Maharashtra are positive affirmation of Modi’s continuing grip on the electorate’s imagination. The Modi wave has swept through Haryana, demolishing the Congress, the Indian National Lok Dal and two other parties that do not now even deserve to be listed by name. From a strength of 4 seats in the 90 member Haryana house, the BJP has now acquired a majority on its own, thanks primarily to Modi’s personal appeal. The BJP does not even have a recognisable leader in Haryana.
In Maharashtra, the BJP story is less compelling, although impressive. The BJP has emerged as the single largest party but falls short of a majority. In fact, if the non-BJP parties want to spite the BJP, they can form a government with Sena at the helm and the others in alliance or offering outside support.
But Modi has conclusively demonstrated that his judgment that the BJP has become more popular than the Shiv Sena and deserves to be the dominant partner in their alliance has been vindicated. The party’s vote share has doubled to about 32% and the credit legitimately goes to Modi than to any regional leader of the party.
However, the stridency of his attack on the Sena during the campaign shows that Modi believed that the BJP would get a majority on its own. That gamble has not paid off. Now, he would have to make that phone call to Uddhav Thackeray to make peace and form the government it is theirs to form together in Maharashtra. The fact that the Shiv Sena’s Anand Geete continues to be a member of the Union government shows that neither the BJP nor the Sena has any hostility towards the other sharp enough to rule out coming together once again in Maharashtra.
The Maharashtra result is notable for the Congress retaining about 50 seats, even in its current state of being completely discredited, leaderless at the state-level and at the Centre and wholly clueless about how to revive itself after being knocked out in the Lok Sabha elections. This means that a Congress-free India, which the BJP has declared to be its medium-term goal, will be quite tough.
For the BJP, its dependence on one man, their mascot, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased. In the process, it has emerged the largest party in Maharastra, broken the dominance of caste in Haryana politics and positioned itself as a party still on the ascendant.
It is time for the government to Centre to turn its mind to taking the tough decisions such as slashing subsidies and boosting investment in the economy, without having to worry about short-term political costs.

BJP s lesson to learn: advantage  but not yet hegemonyComments
Sunday morning brought cheer to the BJP party office in Chandigarh--where the party turned the tables in Haryana politics by leapfrogging to achieve a decisive majority in the state. It brought hope, laced with disappointment, in Mumbai--where the BJP is comfortably the single largest party, but will need support to form the government. It also brought visible celebrations to the party’s central office at New Delhi’s Ashoka Road, but with the realisation among national leaders that the mixed verdict would throw up newer questions about the party’s future strategy.

The BJP replicated key elements of the campaign strategy that had yielded such rich dividends in the Lok Sabha polls.
These included an appetite for political risk, where they broke a 25-year-old alliance with Shiv Sena and went alone in Haryana. It included showcasing the Narendra Modi brand through relentless and energetic rallies, meticulous organization by Amit Shah, wheeling out cabinet ministers to take charge of cluster of constituencies, a media blitzkrieg, reconfiguring the entrenched caste calculus of a particular state’s polity and carving out new social alliances.
The strategy yielded success, but the Lok Sabha results have set the bar so high that anything less than outright majority now looks like a setback.
Read: BJP’s big leap in Maharashtra but short of a mandate
In Haryana, no one--not even rivals--can take away credit from BJP’s impressive victory. Congress, after a decade in power, had become synonymous with corruption and crony capitalism favoring select companies. It did not help that Congress was wrecked with internal rifts. Anti incumbency was rampant, and the question was who would benefit from it. Regional parties, including the Indian National Lok Dal led by Om Prakash Chautala, were relatively discredited. Chautala himself was locked in, and used bail time to campaign. For its part, the BJP had built up an impressive party machinery and decided to turn the old caste equations on its head by mobilizing the non-Jat social groups in the state. Irrespective of who becomes CM, the party has redefined Haryana politics for now. BJP has clearly replaced the Bhajan Lal clan represented now by HJC’s Kuldeep Bishnoi as the leading non Jat formation of the state.
In Maharashtra, there were certain structural conditions common to Haryana. Anti incumbency was rampant; the Congress-NCP coalition in power was seen as closely associated with corruption; and there were strong regional formations.
To understand the scale of BJP’s victory, remember that it was the junior partner in the alliance with SS for decades. It did not have strong political presence in over 150 constituencies out of 288. The tables have turned. In less than a month of rigorous campaigning, it has emerged as the single largest party – outsmarting Congress, the Maratha strongman Sharad Pawar, and SS. Raj Thackeray’s MNS lies decimated.
But this success is only partial. The BJP’s go alone strategy seems to have hit its limits here, for it will need to eat humble pie and return to its ally Shiv Sena to seek support to form the government. This is a setback, for one of Modi’s key campaign cries was how only a majority government – not a coalition – could lead to development. The party won fewer seats than what Lok Sabha trends had suggested for the assembly. Maharashtra defied an increasing trend in recent polls in India – of voters providing a decisive verdict. There will be no single party hegemony, and the politics of give and take and coalitions will continue to govern the Mumbai ethos.  
It is also a testament to how drastically Indian politics has changed in the past six months that what was unthinkable a year ago – an outright win for BJP in Haryana and a decisive edge in Maharashtra – now looks like a mixed success.

MUMBAI: In a surprise development, the NCP today offered outside support to BJP to form a government in Maharashtra "in the interest of stability and development" of the state.
"The people of Maharashtra have not given mandate to any single party. No party is in a position to form a stable government on its own. Keeping in mind the interest of Maharashtra people, we feel we should support the party which can form the government. Maharashtra needs a stable government."
"BJP has emerged as single largest party and we feel that we should given them support from outside so that they can form the government in the interest of the stability and development of the state," NCP leader Praful Patel told reporters here.
The NCP, which was in the government headed by Congress for last 15 years in the state, has won 16 seats and was ahead in 27 others in 288-member Assembly.

Sunday ET | Mumbai Film Fest needs a big drawBREAKING NEWS
Why the Mumbai Film Festival needs more than just interesting films to be a big draw globally

More than making presenting movies a serious affair, MFF and other Indian film festivals like IFFK and the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa, will have to host premieres to get into the big league.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
As the credits to Boyhood roll at the Mumbai Film Festival (MFF), after Mason Evans, Jr. and the girl he has just met philosophize about the little moments in life and what they add up to, questions abound in your mind. How did Richard Linklater, who wrote and directed the film, achieve the seemingly impossible — of shooting annually for 12 years with the same central characters? How did he pack a beautifully-detailed tale of a boy's journey from the age of six to 18 into just 165 minutes? How did he establish the rapport with his actors, especially Ellar Coltrane, the actor who played Evans, Jr., which was the foundation of the film? What would Linklater have done if one of the key actors had died during the course of the shoot or just changed their mind about being in the film?
As the screen goes blank, you wish Linklater, easily among contemporary cinema's finest directors, would appear on stage to answer all these questions. He's not the only director you want to pepper with questions. The Dardenne brothers, Jean-Pierre and Luc, have made possibly the most arresting film about the plight of an individual in times of an economic downturn. Two Days, One Night is about a mother trying to convince 16 of her colleagues over a weekend to forego their bonus so that she can keep her job. Do the Dardenne brothers feel this film would have had the same resonance pre-2008?
Behind the Camera
The audience is in most cases richer for a dialogue with filmmakers. Consider, for instance, Amma & Appa, an endearing documentary about how a German girl and her Tamilian boyfriend get their parents to overcome the vast cultural gulf and agree to their marriage. After the screening, during a much-applauded conversation with the filmmakers, who are also the couple in the film, Franziska Schonenberger and Jayakrishnan Subramanian , the audience gets a peek into the making of the film. Schonenberger says it is she and not Subramanian who chose the old Tamil film songs that act as the film's near-perfect background score, despite not knowing the language. While watching a film on the big screen is definitely an attraction, it is not as crucial to a film-lover as it was in the pre-downloads/streaming era. Films are enjoyed these days on 4.5-inch mobile phones and 120-inch flat screen televisions, though filmmakers would disapprove of this. It is high time Indian festivals realized that getting the makers of some of these wonderful films would impact their future as much as showing the films themselves. "There should be a lot happening alongside screenings at these festivals, like masterclasses, panel discussions and dialogues with great filmmakers," says Hansal Mehta , who directed the critically-acclaimed Shahid, which was screened at multiple film festivals globally. While MFF, which is organized by the Mumbai Academy of Moving Image (MAMI) and which is in its 16th year, has directors like Anurag Kashyap and Vishal Bhardwaj holding forth on their favourite films and the craft of filmmaking, it still lacks international names.
Getting Marquee Names
Srinivasan Narayanan, director of MFF, says the fest needs a huge kitty to be able to get these names. "We have raised Rs 3.5 crore and we still need at least another Rs 1 crore," he adds. MFF, which is the only large film festival in India that is not government funded, was facing a serious fund crunch a few weeks ago and celebrities like Aamir Khan and Vidhu Vinod Chopra , entities like Cinestaan Film Company, which Anand Mahindra has invested in, and the public chipped in to make the festival happen this year.
Narayanan adds that the festival also needs to be high-profile enough for film luminaries to attend. Oliver Stone, maker of JFK and Natural Born Killers, and Costa Gavras, director of Z, were at MFF in 2010 and 2013, respectively. Similarly, South Korean filmmaker Kim Ki-duk attended the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) last year. But these names are few and far between. Mehta says the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF), which is only a decade-old, is able to get global celebrities thanks to its financial muscle. Kevin Spacey, Cate Blanchett and Colin Firth are among those who have been part of DIFF.
The festival's attempt to force-fit Bollywood celebrities into screenings has not gone down well with festival-goers. At the first screening of Two Days, One Night, where actor Imran Khan was supposed to present the film, the hostile audience demanded the show be started immediately. When Khan said he had no idea what he was supposed to do and that he was waiting for the organizers to tell him, a member of the audience said, "You are supposed to present the film, so please do that," to which Khan responded by asking the organizers to start the film. Anupama Chopra, film critic and creative director of MFF, issued a statement clarifying the situation: "Imran Khan was not there as an expert on this particular film. He was there as a supporter of MAMI and a cinema lover. What happened was mismanagement on our part, not his. He was one of the first people to lend support to the festival and the drive to raise money for it."
First Festival of Choice
More than making presenting movies a serious affair, MFF and other Indian film festivals like IFFK and the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa, will have to host premieres to get into the big league. While the likes of Cannes, Berlin and Venice have been among the first choices of filmmakers for decades, in the last decade or so, festivals like Sundance (in Utah, US), Telluride (Colorado, US), Tribeca (New York) and Toronto International Film Festival have made their presence felt by snagging some key premieres. Sundance, founded by actor Robert Redford , has become synonymous with independent cinema and Boyhood debuted there. Telluride has in the recent past snagged premieres of films which went on to win Oscars, like The King's Speech and Argo. Even well-known small Indian films like Ship of Theseus, Shahid and The Lunchbox have premiered at foreign festivals, the first two at Toronto and the third at Cannes, mainly because of the opportunity they provide to find distributors for different markets. "Producers know a film will not sell via an Indian film festival and films now have a shorter shelf life than they used to, and that's why we don't get good premieres," says K Hariharan, director of LV Prasad Film & TV Academy, Chennai. Narayanan notes that festivals like Toronto and Telluride are boxoffice festivals. "The premieres are ticketed; we can't do that. And the festival passes are expensive. At Berlin, even journalists have to pay EUR 80 each. Here, even charging Rs 1,500 for a festival pass is a big deal," he adds.
With the involvement of more and more influential names from the film fraternity, MFF does stand a chance of becoming more than just a place to watch great films, but with intense competition both within India and without, getting there is an arduous journey.
Notable Films at This Year's Mumbai Film Fest
Boyhood (US): A coming-of-age drama of a boy from the age of six to 18, shot with the same actors, including the protagonist, over 12 years, the film is nothing short of a cinematic milestone, a catharsis for the viewer. Written and directed by Richard Linklater, the screenings of the film were sold out, with people seated in the aisles.
Two Days, One Night (Belgium): No film in recent times has told an individual's tale of the effect of an economic downturn as well as this one, directed by brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. A mother, played by Marion Cotillard, working in a solar panel factory in a Belgian town has to convince 16 of her colleagues over a weekend to forego their bonus so that she can keep her job.
Snow (Iran): Made in that uberrealistic mode that has become a trademark of Iranian filmmakers, director Mehdi Rahmani's film chronicles a day in the life of a family which is going to lose its house to a bank in a few days as the mother has to deal with a deadbeat son and a daughter who is remarrying, while making sense of all this to her other son.
The 50 Year Argument (US): It is but obvious that Martin Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas has not been another work of fiction but the documentary on Bob Dylan , No Direction Home. So when he turns his lens, along with David Tedeschi, to the history and influence of the high-brow New York Review of Books, the magazine which turned 50 last year, it is a very well-spent 90 minutes for the viewer.

Rahul & Sonia Gandhi: Accept people s verdict in Maharashtra  Haryana pollsHaryana Polls
("We accept people's verdict.…)
NEW DELHI: Congratulating BJP for its victory in both Maharashtra and Haryana assembly polls, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday accepted his party's defeat.
"We accept people's verdict . Congress will work hard on the ground to once again earn people's confidence," Rahul said. "People voted for change," Rahul added.
Congress President Sonia Gandhi said, "Congress party accepts the election verdict delivered by the people of Maharashtra & Haryana with humility." "People of Maharashtra & Haryana trusted us with their mandate thrice & twice respectively. Congress resolves to play a constructive and vigilant role," she added.
Meanwhile, in a surprise development, the NCP offered outside support to BJP to form a government in Maharashtra "in the interest of stability and development" of the state.
"The people of Maharashtra have not given mandate to any single party. No party is in a position to form a stable government on its own. Keeping in mind the interest of Maharashtra people, we feel we should support the party which can form the government. Maharashtra needs a stable government.
"BJP has emerged as single largest party and we feel that we should given them support from outside so that they can form the government in the interest of the stability and development of the state," NCP leader Praful Patel told reporters.
The NCP, which was in the government headed by Congress for last 15 years in the state, has won 16 seats and was ahead in 27 others in 288-member Assembly.
Falling short of a majority, BJP is emerging as the largest party in Maharashtra assembly and Shiv Sena is finishing second, triggering conciliatory noises from the two former allies over government formation but each appeared to be waiting for the other to blink first.

10-yr-old terminally ill boy becomes Hyderabad Police chief for a dayTen-year-old Sadiq wanted to be police commissioner for a day and his wish was fulfilled by Hyderabad Police Commisisoner Mahender Reddy on Wednesday.
 
Clad in khaki with a cap, the terminally ill boy occupied the chair of the police commissioner while Mahender Reddy and other officers saluted him.
 
The boy hailing from Karimnagar district of Telangana was inspired by some of his relatives working in police department and aspired to become the police chief.
 
Sadiq's wish was fulfilled thanks to the efforts of Make A Wish Foundation, a voluntary organisation working to fulfill the wishes of children with life threatening illness.
 
"I want to catch rowdies," said the boy when asked what he would do as police commissioner.
 
Mahender Reddy said he was feeling happy to fulfill the boy's wish.
 
Pushpa Devi Jain from the foundation said by fulfilling the wishes of children with life threatening medical condition, they were trying to give them happiness which could help in extending their life span.
 
She said the foundation helped in fulfilling the wishes of many such children. Some children want to meet celebrities and leaders.
 
In August, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhara Rao fulfilled the wish of a boy by meeting him at a city hospital.
 
Pushpa appealed to popular Telugu film actor Pawan Kalyan to fulfill the wish of a girl in Khammam district of Telangana. Suffering from brain tumor, the girl has the wish to meet the star.

Child labour in India: The kids aren t alrightComments
As the traffic signal near Masjid Moth in Delhi changes to red and cars start pulling up, ten-year-old Raina (name changed) stops playing with the other children waiting at the lights, and arranges her face in her trademark expression of distress. Slowly, she begins weaving her way between the cars, peering into the rolled-up windows, coaxing commuters to buy an angry bird or chhota bheem balloon. Behind her, other children peddle their various wares of toys, flowers and pens. When one glass window lowers, Raina begins to hand out a ballon. But out comes a hand holding a large box of pizza and a bottle of coke. The mysterious benefactor wins a whoop of delight and a face-splitting grin from Raina.
Kailash Satyarthi's organization Bachpan Bachao Andolan was India’s first civil society campaign against the exploitation of children.
As India and the world celebrates Kailash Satyarthi's Nobel Peace Prize, child labour - which the child rights activist has been working to eradicate - continues to hold millions of children like Raina in its grasp. In its annual report for 2012-13, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, that Satyarthi founded, mentions 4,936 cases of child labour that it has identified.
Also read: Sayarthi gets Nobel but plight of child workers still deplorable
The organisation claims to have rescued 976 child labourers and filed complaints in 72 cases. Sixty-three First Information Reports were registered against employers. In a research paper on its website, the organisation reports that, as per Census 2011, 11.7 million children are employed in India. Non-Government Organisations working in this field estimate that there are 60 million child labourers. According to the Ministry of Human Resource and Development, 8.15 million children are currently out of school in India, says the report.
Much Ground To Cover
"Our focus has to be on out-of-school children. All out-of-school children are potential resources for the labour market. There has to be better implementation of the Right to Education Act," insists Kushal Singh, former chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.
India is not the only country with a child labour problem. According to UNICEF, the Asia-Pacific region (ILO regional classification) had the most child labourers aged 5-17 (77.7 million) in 2012 as compared with 59 million in Sub-Saharan Africa and 12.5 million in Latin America and the Caribbean. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest incidence of child labour, with one in five children involved.
However, "India does have one of the highest numbers of child workers in the world," confirms Vandana Kandhari, Child Protection Specialist, UNICEF (India). According to the 2013 edition of UNICEF's the State of the World's Children, 12% of children aged 5 to 14 in India are child workers (i.e. 28 million children). There is no one figure to establish the number of child labourers in the country as different organisations have their own ways of computing. Also, organisations treat 17 ,18 or 14 variously as the cut-off age for child labour. 
What many activists find difficult to accept, however, is that, even after years of having legislations in place, there is still so much ground to cover in India. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986 bans the employment of children up to the age of 14 in hazardous occupations. The National Policy on Child Labour declared in August, 1987, contains an action plan to tackle the problem of child labour. The Supreme Court, in a judgement passed in December 1996, directed the authorities to conduct a survey to identify working children, withdrawal of children working in hazardous industries, and ensure they are educated in appropriate institutions. It also directed them to provide help and rehabilitation to the childrens' families. In 1992, India was the first country to join The International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, a global programme launched by the International Labour Organisation a year before. India has also signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Yet, despite years of efforts made by government and non-government bodies, lakhs of children continue to be drafted into the country's labour force. In 2013, Childline India Foundation received a total of 15,636 calls from victims of child labour, up from 10,574 in 2012 and 5,805 in 2011. "Our research has shown that 11 per cent of India's workforce consists of children below 18 years of age," says Nishit Kumar of Childline. He adds, "The statistics on Child Labour are hopelessly outdated resulting in faulty evaluation of the situation and planning. The Comptroller and Auditor General  [Audit Report (Civil)] routinely under-report the true numbers of working children, or it simply does not bother to conduct the surveys needed to properly identify these children." That poverty is the prime reason pushing these children to work at an early age is a no-brainer. But there are other reasons that compound the problem. "Child labourers are drawn from the most socio-economically marginalised communities, such as those from minorities and the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). Traditionally deprived of access to quality and age-appropriate education, health facilities, employment, and developmental initiatives such as those for poverty alleviation, they are often discriminated against. The low levels of skills and unemployment or underemployment of adults, combined with the discrimination that children may face in schools, pushes many of these children to work. Urban children are more vulnerable due to increasing work opportunities," explains Vandana Kandhari of UNICEF. Legal and bureaucratic malfunctions and loopholes worsen the situation. "There are no systems to help reintegrate or rehabilitate the children," says Soha Moitra, regional director-North, Child Rights and You (CRY). Often, those rescued from labour return to work in the absence of a family livelihood. Adds Nishit of Childline, "Child labourers fall within the ambit of not just the child labour law and certain other labour laws but also the Juvenile Justice law as they are children in need of care and protection. However, the rate of conviction under the child labour laws is poor, clearly pointing to weak enforcement of laws." The present Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) 1986, itself is restricted in its impact. It is also in conflict with other regulations relating to children. The Act does not prohibit child labour but only restricts their employment in jobs deemed to be hazardous, as at firework-making factories, for example. Also, it talks of children only up to the age of 14. This is in contradiction to the Juvenile Justice Act, which defines children as those under the age of 18. An amendment to the Child Labour Act is pending in Parliament.  The  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2012 proclaims that it "is proposed to prohibit employment of children below the age of 14 years in all occupations and processes to facilitate their enrolment in schools in view of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 and to prohibit employment of adolescents (persons who have completed fourteenth year of age but have not completed eighteenth year) in hazardous occupations and processes and to regulate the conditions of service of adolescents in line with the ILO Convention 138 and Convention 182, respectively."
What Needs To Be Done
Rights activists, however, want a blanket ban on the employment of children up to the age of 18. "Legislation should not divide children into child and adolescent as both are equally vulnerable. The Law should not allow a child below 18 years of age to be engaged in any employment. A large amount of work in which girls are engaged does not even figure as child labour," says Moitra, adding, "It is well established that girl children are largely engaged in running the household from a very early age, even before they are capable of wage-earning activities. The government must consider all children in the workforce whether the work done is paid or unpaid, part of family labour or for an outside employer." Proper and accurate data collection on child labour is imperative for effective policy making and programming. Society too plays a role. "If we stop patronizing employers and products that use child labourers, it will help in eliminating child labour from," points out CRY's regional director-North. Unless we do, children like Raina will continue to be a common sight at traffic signals, at middle class homes (taking care of children who are only a little younger than themselves), at farms and brick kilns, at the mechanics where we have our cars repaired and at factories that manufacture our Diwali sparklers.
Case Studies
'I have learnt nothing else in life'
Child labour is more of a norm than an exception in the Banarasi silk industry. In hundreds of power loom units operating in narrow lanes across the city, children as young as 11 years of age work tirelessly from 8am until 7pm, with just an hour-long lunch break in between. They earn as little as Rs. 2,000-2,500 a month. A few generous employers pay an extra Rs. 100 for food. The only respite is on Sundays. For Mehboob (12) of Lallapura, working at a power loom has become a way of life. His neighbours Ahmad (12) and Rizwan (11) also work at the same power loom.
Ask Mehboob about his dreams and he reveals that weaving is his only skill. "I have learnt nothing else in life. For the past one-and-a-half years, I have been working at this power loom. I want to become a skilled weaver and own a power loom when I grow up," he says. Ahmad and Rizwan share his ambition. 
Power loom owners and even the parents of the children insist that kids working in the silk industry must not be equated with other child labourers. These children are learning the rare skill of weaving, which will help earn a livelihood when they grow up, says Atiq Ansari, a weaver leader. Besides, the weavers' families are not in a position to invest in books, school fees and uniforms for their children. 
"No well-off parent will send his child to work on a loom. All child weavers come from poor families," says Ansari. "If they do not work, who will feed them?"

'I won't let my kids work'
Dipali Kahar (12) started working as domestic help with her mother as a seven-year-old. Her father, Lakshman, is a polio patient and can't work for a living. She has two sisters and a brother. Through the week Dipali works in two houses as domestic help, where she washes utensils and cleans rooms. She has never been to school. Once she did dream of studying like other children, "But not anymore. If I go to school who will support my family? My mother and I must work to keep the family going now," says the girl with a maturity that belies her age. At 6.30 every morning she leaves the house with her mother to go to the houses where she works. They return at 11am. A second round of chores awaits her at 3pm when she works for two-and-a-half hours.
"After returning home, my mother cooks and I play with my sisters Ruma (4) and Tulsi (3)," she says. When she isn't playing with them, she visits neighbouring houses to watch television. Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif are her favourite actors. Dipali earns Rs. 1,100 every month, almost all of which she gives to her mother for the household expenses. She keeps Rs 50 for herself to splurge on phuchkas and bindis. Ask her about her dreams and she says with determination: "I will get married. But I will not allow my child to work as domestic help like me. I'll send my child to school. I'll not put family responsibilities on their shoulders."

'At tea stall for a month'
Sahil was brought to Delhi from his ancestral village in Bihar by his "uncle" on the pretext of sending him to school in the National Capital Region. The boy claims he did attend the local madrasa for a while, before being drafted in to assist his uncle at his tea stall in the Kasturba Gandhi Marg area. He looks much younger than the 15 years he claims to be. "Uncle is not really a family member, but we are from the same village," says Sahil, adding, "I have been working at the tea stall for a month now. Uncle said his regular helper had left and so started bringing me with him to the stall." An average day at the tea shop starts at 9am and continues until 7pm.
Work mainly consists of washing the glasses used to serve tea to customers. There are no off days. "I work every day," Sahil confirms. When not working, he sits on a stool watching passers-by or listening to conversations of customers. There doesn't seem to be much point even in asking him about his dreams or whether he likes this life as he has little with which to compare it. "In the village, I didn't work but neither did I go to school. I would roam about the village all day, or just sit at home. My father doesn't work. My elder brother supports the family," he says. Hindustan Times was unable to question Sahil about his earnings at the shop. The moment his employer spotted him talking to this reporter, he was called away. Subsequent attempts to reach out to Sahil also failed. A survey conducted by CRY this year showed that most employers are aware that it is illegal to employ children.

'Good. At least they are earning money'
The story of the brothers M Simyon (16) (in picture right) and M Danial (14) of Kovilpatti village in Tamil Nadu's Virudhunagar district, who both work in the firecracker units of Sivakasi, shows that there is enough awareness about child labour for people to try and hide this dark but open secret. At 8.30am every morning, Simyon, Danial, their mother Pancharatnam and father A Michael Raj head out to work at a local kulai kadai - the small unit that works on contract basis for big firecracker manufacturing companies.
The family includes a sister Rosie, who has studied until Standard 12, and doesn't work. Together, the family makes Rs. 20,000 per month. Pancharatnam believes working keeps her sons out of trouble. "It is good that at least they are earning some money and have not gotten into bad ways," she says when asked why her sons aren't in school. "I want Danial to study and take him to school. But he runs away at the mere mention of studies," she adds. The family knows that admitting that Danial works even though he is only 14 might lead to problems. Which is why, possibly, Danial was missing from home when this reporter arrived there to talk to him. His elder brother Simyon did the talking. "When I started working three years ago, I was paid Rs. 1,000. I gave half of it to my mother and kept half of it for myself," he says. Simyon says that he dropped out of school in class VII as he had failed and was uncomfortable studying with his younger classmates.

'I would like to study'
Narendra was rescued from a construction site in Noida recently where he had been working as a bonded labourer along with his parents. The family had been working there for the past four months without any remuneration and were also being stopped from leaving the site. "I started working when I was 12. The thekedar (labour contractor) would beat me up and threaten me and tell my parents that they would not get any money unless I too worked with them. My parents didn't want me to work, but they had no option. We are so poor," says the boy, who has studied till class VIII.
"When I started working, I used to work as a labourer assistant and get Rs. 50-60 a day. This was the first time that I was working as a proper construction labourer but they didn't pay us anything. I would like to study, but where is the money?" he wonders. Age comes sooner to those with responsibilities. Ask Narendra whether he would like to go back to school now that he has been rescued from bondage and might expect rehabilitation from the government and he says, "I am too old to go to school now." The family ekes out a difficult living in the village with his parents rolling bidis in the season, or harvesting soyabean and other crops when needed in other people's fields. For the most part, they work as migrant labourers on construction sites. His parents have no Below Poverty Level or MGNREGA (job) cards. "We have to move around so much for work, that often we are not there in the village when these forms are filled," explains Gulab, Narendra's father. Narendra's only dream now is to find some work to earn enough to support his family and have a secure future for himself. "I have four younger siblings. I want them to study," he says.

'Dream of being a teacher'
His feet in worn slippers, his legs marked by injuries from unending hours of walking buffaloes through rough terrain, and his body laden with dust, Bipin Chero, is the true face of India's child labour problem. All of eight years old, the tribal boy from Badalgarh village in the Kaimur hills of Rohtas district in western Bihar supplements his family's income by working long hours grazing buffaloes that belong to the village head. So poor are the people in this part of Bihar that owning a few buffaloes, which Bipin grazes for a small consideration, makes the village head, Basgit Chero, one of the richest local tribals. "If I don't do this, my family won't have enough to eat," Bipin says. He also wields an axe, locally known as 'tangi', to clear the bushes for the buffaloes to move. He also helps his father Mahendra Chero, a woodcutter. Bipin's elder brother, Arvind (13) works as a farm labourer in Punjab to contribute to the family's meagre income.
His younger brother Ankit (5) and sister Tetar (3) have to be home with their mother Hemvati, who doesn't keep well. So keen is Bipin to make something of his life that despite the financial hardship, he forced his father to enroll him in the village school, working hard to balance work and study. His mother helps him continue at school by minding the buffaloes for him during study hours. As soon as school is over, Bipin is back to the grazing fields so his mother can go home and cook for her husband and children. "I want to become Sirji someday," says the boy, revealing his dream to become a teacher at the lone school in the village. Bipin earns `1,000 a month, which he hands over to his mother. "All the free time I have is about an hour in the evening to play," he says. Playing usually involves chatting with his mother and younger siblings. There is no electricity, television or radio, so the family retires to bed early. The same grind resumes at the crack of dawn the next day.

'Someday, I hope to play more'
Hanif is paid based on how much plastic he can collect from the heaps of dry waste he handles every day. There are no fans in the godown where he works from 9 am to 6.30 pm. His only break is half an hour for lunch. His duties also involve buying the heaps of waste and carrying them from a larger godown in the sprawling slum of Dharavi, to the smaller godown where he works. "It's a tough job. I get paid `14 per kg of plastic, so sometimes I make as much as Rs. 150 a day, and sometimes - if the batch has only paper and cardboard - I make nothing at all," he says.
The story of how Hanif went from a school-going boy to a child labourer is an all-too-familiar one. "I dropped out in Class 5. My father died and I had to find work to help support the family. I've been working ever since," he says. The youngest of three siblings, Hanif's two brothers work as manual labourers. Together, they support their mother, grandmother, the married brother's wife and their two children. "I liked school. I liked studying. English and Maths were my favourite subjects," Hanif says. "I want to go back. But I doubt I will ever return to regular school." Instead, Hanif is planning to enroll in night school. "But the only night school in my area is an English-medium one and I am scared I won't be able to keep up," he says. So, for now, he attends free study classes conducted by NGO Acorn Foundation, which works specifically with children and adults in the informal waste-recycling - or rag-picking - industry. "I can't go every day, because sometimes I have to work late. But I go as often as I can, especially for the English and Maths classes, and the football sessions," he says, smiling. "I want to grow up and be a footballer because playing football with my friends is the best part of my week. I just hope that someday I can spend more time playing than working."

'I'm working to buy new clothes'
Barely ten kilometres from the state secretariat, where policy makers plan the state's future, Sheela Kumari (11) works beside her mother at a stone-crushing plant in Tupudana. Covering her face with a thin towel to shield herself from the dust, she stands waiting next to the machine which processes small rocks. She has been working at this plant for the past two weeks and sees it as an opportunity to earn some money of her own. As both her parents are engaged in working at the stone crushing plant, this seemed almost an obvious choice for her. "I am working here for a few days to earn some money so that I am able to buy some new clothes for myself," she says shyly.
Kumari lives nearby with her parents. Interestingly, she also goes to the neighbourhood school where she studies in standard V. She has been, however, missing school to work at the plant. Her job requires her to spend long hours in the dust carrying the processed rocks on her head in a tin basket. She then transfers these rocks into another machine which further processes and crushes these rocks into a fine powder. Kumari spends more than nine hours working at the plant each day for which she receives Rs. 600 per week.
"I come to the plant at 8 in the morning and leave when the work finishes around 5.30 in the evening," she says. After returning home in the evening, she likes to play with her friends in the meager leisure time that she gets. "I will resume going to school from next Monday," she says. Her humble background, however, does not stop her from dreaming big. She says that she wants to complete her studies and plans to become a doctor in the future.

It isn't clear if eleven-year-old Bimal's maternal uncle, Ram Bahadur, is his saviour or his tormentor. If it weren't for Bahadur, the boy would probably have been at an orphanage or on the streets. Bahadur, who adopted Bimal after his father died of tuberculosis two years ago, has put the boy to work at the same automobile repairing garage where he is a painter. But he also sends the boy to school.
"When he contracted tuberculosis last year, I sold my wife's jewellery to pay for his treatment. I send him to an English medium school. He's like my own son," says Bahadur. Bahadur has two daughters from his first marriage that ended with the death of his wife in 2009. He has another two-year-old girl from his second marriage.
"My wife and my children stay with my parents in Jalpaiguri (West Bengal). My wife doesn't treat Bimal well. That's why I brought him here," he says.
Putting Bimal to work at the garage, where the boy is paid Rs. 1,700 per month and dinner, is the only way to keep him alive, Bahadur says. "I use his salary to pay for his food and education. I don't want his money. It will be paap (a sin)."
Bimal's day starts at 7 am. "I help uncle make breakfast. School starts at 8.30 am and goes on till 3 pm. After school, I walk (three km) to the garage. I sleep for some time and then work till 10.30 or 11 pm," he says. But what work can he possibly do at his age? "I help mix the putty. My uncle applies the putty and sprays the paint. I rub the putty coat to make it smooth and help polish the vehicle after the paint is sprayed. I also sweep the place and help the other mechanics," says Bimal. "The garage owner is generous. Otherwise, for this kind of work boys are generally paid only `1,000 a month," says Bhadur. Both are aware that child labour is illegal. Ask Bimal whether he prefers work or study and he says, "I don't like to work and I don't like school. But I like the games period at school." His dream is to become a driver when he grows up. "I can drive fast and listen to songs," he says. Bahadur explains that Bimal loves cars and is often in conversation with customers.

10 major metro cities in the making in India
The new central government has brought a new hope to the country's dwindling realty sector. The ruling party's manifesto has talked about creating 100 new smart cities in the country several times. It has has also taken certain steps such as creating REITs and INVITS to boost the development of the realty sector in the country. This is backed by a strong focus on improving the city's Infrastructure.
Property values in most cities have already witnessed a good growth in the last one year, especially over 2-3 quarters, due to the growing demand for property. With a good growth in infrastructure, these cities maybe soon expected to become the next set of major metropolitan cities.
Here are 10 cities we think have the making of the next major metro, according to the data collected from CommonFloor.

NH-11 and NH-12 pass through Jaipur district. Furthermore, a good connectivity to NH-8 and affordable real estate prices as compared to Gurgaon and Delhi, and the upgrading of Jaipur Airport to international standards are expected to bring the city into the real estate spotlight.

RIL may not gain from the gas price hike: Analysts
The Centre's move to increase natural gas prices to $5.61 per million British thermal units (mBtu) from November 1 would be a negative for Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), analysts said, as RIL would continue to get the current rate of $4.2 till it made good the shortfall in output from its KG-D6 block. "The development from RIL's new fields - D-34 and R series - will not be viable at the current price. We had estimated a $6-7 increase in gas prices, which has not come about. At this price, ...

What s next after wild week for stocksWhat's next after wild week for stocks?
AP Oct 18, 2014, 09.16PM IST
(The Dow Jones industrial…)
NEW YORK: The stock market needs to see a therapist.
Temperamental, flighty, prone to violent mood swings, the market took investors on a wild ride this week. From one day to the next, even within a few hours, stocks swung from despair to optimism, deep losses to big gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 460 points at one point Wednesday, but pared most of those losses by the end of the trading day. On Friday, it surged 263 points. The difference between the Dow's high and the low for the week was the largest in nearly three years.
Investors seemed buffeted from every corner: Plunging oil prices, signs of a slowdown in Europe and fear of Ebola on the downside; strong corporate earnings and reassuring jobs market figures on the upside.
``We've entered a high-volatility market, and it's here to stay,'' said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist of Bell Curve Trading.
Here's a look at the factors driving the manic trading, and the outlook for next week:
EUROPEAN RECESSION?
Investors are afraid that Europe could slip into another recession, perhaps deeper than the one it emerged from just a year ago, and the slowdown could cut into US corporate profits.
The bad news from Europe started piling up earlier this month. Germany, the region's biggest economy, said that manufacturing output fell. The International Monetary Fund cut its estimate of 2014 growth in the eurozone to an anemic 0.8 per cent. Then came news on Tuesday that industrial production for the 18-country region plunged in August, and people really got spooked.
The Chinese economy, the world's second largest, is slowing, too.
``Can the US continue to recover if the major drivers of the global economy_ Europe and China _ continue to struggle? I don't think so,'' said Bell Curve's Strazzullo. ``I think we'll have subpar growth and you'll see that in the lower equity prices.''
Even some optimists are worried.
``In this slowdown, it's more serious,'' said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities, referring to the eurozone. ``It's Germany and France, not just the periphery countries (like Greece), that are causing the damage.''
Still, Vitner added, the danger to the US is easy to exaggerate. He noted that the US is a relatively closed economy. Only 14 per cent of US economic output comes from exports, one of the lowest such shares in the world.
One measure of trouble in the eurozone to watch is its purchasing managers' index, a broad gauge of business activity. The next reading comes out Thursday.
OIL PRICE PLUNGE
Benchmark US crude closed at the $82.75 a barrel on Friday, one its lowest prices in years. The drop has hammered energy companies this month. Two Dow members, Chevron and Exxon Mobil, have fallen 6 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively.
Ultimately, the drop in oil could be good for stocks, though. That's because a fall in prices means drivers will end up paying much less to fill up their tanks, leaving them more money to spend on other things, like travel and clothes and dinners out.
  Gas at the pump has already fallen to less than $3 a gallon in some parts of the country, noted USAA Investment Assistant Vice President John Jares in a report on Wednesday. He wrote that the drop in gas could prove a ``boon to retailers'' in the holiday shopping season, and cited it as one reason USAA mutual funds were buying stocks this week.
US ECONOMY
A pickup in spending would sure help calm investor nerves.
One of the triggers for the sickening 460 point drop in the Dow on Wednesday was a report showing retail sales declined 0.3 per cent in September from the previous month. Purchases of autos, gasoline, furniture and clothing all slowed.
``The economy remains stuck on the same shallow growth trajectory that has been in place for the past several years,'' economist Steven Ricchiuto of Mizuho Securities wrote to clients shortly after the numbers came out Wednesday.
Still, it's important to put the bad news in context. The US economy is in the best shape in years. Employers are hiring at the strongest pace in 15 years and most economists expect the US to grow a healthy 3 per cent this year and next.
Investors will get more tea leaves to read on US consumers next week. Internet powerhouse Amazon.com reports earnings on Thursday and shipping giant United Parcel Service on Friday.
THE PROFIT PICTURE
In the end, you can talk your head off about the state of the global economy and the US consumer. But the biggest driver of stocks is earnings.
Exhibit A: The blowout profits reported by General Electric and Textron on Friday, which helped propel the Standard and Poor's 500 index up 1.3 per cent.

Embrace your skin colour. Or not.Dusky Bollywood Divas Who Went For Skin Lightening Treatment
Bollywoodshaadis.com –  Tue 14 Oct, 2014 6:51 PM IST
Share 0
While the Europeans spend an insane amount of time and money in going for fake tan to achieve a dusky-dark look, we Indians cannot get over our age-long lust to get fairer. All we can say is, “The skin is always fairer on the other side.” Haven't we all heard of the matrimonial ads that talk about "looking for a fair, homely girl"? Fair skin, no doubt, is an obsession that Indians hold close to their hearts. This is especially true when you see our Bollywood actresses, who are ready to go to any length to get a fairer-looking skin.
If you don’t believe us, then we have compiled a list of B-town divas who have undergone the skin lightening treatment (even the ones you didn’t expect). Take a look, and you will see a substantially visible proof to justify why they are on our list.

Kajol
Kajol has always been known for being a bold Bong beauty, who carried off her dusky complexion with attitude and ease. But, so we thought, as she decided to get rid of her dusky look, and tag. She underwent skin melanin surgery which lowers the concentration of melanin on skin with the help of chemical compounds.
The results are so clearly visible that there are no doubts in the media's speculations about it, everyone is pretty sure of it.

Priyanka Chopra
Among the many surgeries and treatments she has undergone, skin lightening treatment is one of them. Compare her recent images to those of her Miss World days, and it is clear that she is a fairer reflection of her former self.
It is rumoured that she underwent the treatment sometime in the past four years.

Shilpa Shetty
She has been in the limelight for quite some time in spite of remaining aloof from acting. Recently, rumours surround her of having undergone skin lightening treatment, but she has dismissed them casually, calling it her pregnancy glow.
Well, we never really knew that pregnancy glow can change your skin colour this extent (and permanently), or can it?

Bipasha Basu
Named the confident ‘Dusky Beauty’ of Bollywood, she was voted one of the sexiest woman in Asia for the year 2005 and 2007. She was always quoted as saying “I am dark-skinned and am proud of it”. However, hypocrisy slipped out of her nature forced by pity taunts and hurtful comments, and she finally gave in.
Sometime in the recent past the actress decided to undergo skin bleaching, and a source close to her confirms of media speculations surrounding her.

Sridevi
If you thought it is only the younger lot that is moving towards this skin lightning trend, then you are certainly wrong. Take a look at Sridevi in her Tamil films, or any of those from her earlier days, and compare them with any photo from her Hindi film career, and you shall see the stark difference.
Sridevi and Rekha are two yesteryear actresses, who have underwent drastic changes, as their film careers evolved.
Rekha
Yes, the now 'fairer than thou' diva was at one time a dusky beauty. But, if one cannot question the younger lot for giving into the obsession of fairer skin, then do you think one should be questioning Sridevi or Rekha?
Must See: 10 Bollywood Actresses Who Look Best without Makeup
Maybe these on-screen divas just could not hold their forts when it came to standing against the society's obsession for fair skin. However, all we hope for, is that others, especially the younger lot, sets an example and stands tall for how they look, rather than how they are looked at.

Meet KP Singh: The man who built India s first  smart  cityPrint
By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - It was, by his own account, a chance encounter with a scion of the Gandhi political dynasty that turned former soldier Kushal Pal Singh into the man who built a city from nothing and made billions in the process.
Singh was toppled from his spot as India's richest property developer this week, when his company DLF Ltd (DLF.NS) was hit with an unprecedented three-year ban from capital markets, accused by the regulator of failing to disclose key information at the time of its record-breaking 2007 market listing.
Investors wiped more than $1.3 billion off the indebted company's market value after the decision.
Village boy-turned-visionary developer, Singh may be largely unknown outside India. But as the man who built "boom city" Gurgaon and fostered the outsourcing industry - with a little help, he says, from ex-General Electric boss Jack Welch - he has been among the most influential Indian names of recent decades.
His political links, to the Gandhi family in particular, have also placed him among the more controversial.
To its cheerleaders, Gurgaon, the city he imagined and built 15 miles outside India's capital Delhi, is a prototype of where young, upwardly mobile Indians want to live and work. The outsourcing boom has made the city India's third-richest.
"It is India's first smart city," said Rajeev Talwar, executive director at DLF. "Its infrastructure may be creaking ... but there is a new part which supports a new kind of life."
To its detractors, though, Gurgaon is the epitome of the fervid real estate speculation and dysfunctional urban sprawl that threaten India's cities as populations boom. Water and power are unreliable, social problems abound and private contractors have had to step in where the police have failed.
Its population has ballooned by about three-quarters to 1.5 million people in the decade to 2011.
BOOM CITY
It has been a difficult year for Singh, whose fate from the start has been closely tied to that of the Gandhi family. Haryana, the state neighbouring Delhi and including Gurgaon, has long been a stronghold for the family and the Congress party.
After a decade in power Congress, led by Sonia Gandhi, was ousted in May's general election by Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Haryana's voters threw out Congress in a state election this week and strongly backed the BJP, exit polls show. Results are due Sunday.
"There are businesses that have benefited from managing their political connections, and real estate is one of them," said an executive whose company works with DLF, but did not wish to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
In Singh's case, the link goes back decades.
In his autobiography, Singh describes how in 1980 he accidentally met Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia's husband and India's prime minister from 1984 to 1989, when the latter was travelling to Gurgaon and had stopped for water to cool his car's radiator.
Singh, whose family property firm had been pushed out of the capital by strict development laws, says he shared his plan for the dry and desolate Gurgaon region, and his fate was sealed.
The chance meeting served DLF well for several years during which Singh - even at 82, a sharp dresser with military bearing - amassed 3,500 acres of land in Gurgaon, some of it still undeveloped.
"A salute to the old man to have at that time thought of putting together the entire site and not be tempted to gain by selling parcels of land to other developers," said Anuj Puri, chairman and country head of Jones Lang LaSalle, a property consultancy that advises DLF.
In 2007, DLF listed in what was then India's largest IPO. The atmosphere at DLF, one employee recalled, was "electric".
However, politics also cost Singh dearly - DLF has been pulled up several times by opposition party members and anti-corruption activists who accused it of improper land deals with family members of Congress chief Sonia.
It is familiar ground for Singh, whose fallout with Haryana's Congress party chief minister in the 80s cost DLF nearly a decade of lost development opportunities.
But the timing of the regulator's order this week, two days before the Haryana state polls, has strengthened views that DLF's close ties with Congress could also work against it.
For the regulator, it is simply about targeting the big fish, in a bid to boost investor confidence. DLF and its supporters say they will seek to work with the government, regardless of political shades.
But even detractors say it is not the end of the road for Singh or DLF.
"It is not the end of the road for them. These companies don't disappear," said Prashant Bhushan, a veteran lawyer and anti-corruption activist who has long campaigned against DLF.
DLF on Friday filed an appeal against the regulator's order. The first hearing will be heard on Oct. 22.

Finally! Stocks rally. But can it lastFinally! Stocks rally. But can it last?
By Paul R. La Monica and Heather Long   @CNNMoneyInvest October 17, 2014: 4:08 PM ET
 
Whew! What a week for stocks!
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
For one day at least, Wall Street remembered that earnings matter.
Stocks are storming higher Friday. The Dow rose 263 points, or 1.6%, its second best day of the entire year. Meanwhile the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each finished about 1% higher, and European markets rallied as well.
Strong results from General Electric ( GE ), Morgan Stanley ( MS ) and Honeywell ( HON ) put traders in a good mood for the first time in more than a week. Also helping: investors continue to hold out some faint hope that the Federal Reserve may keep the easy money party going just a little bit longer.
While Friday's rebound is optimistic, stocks are still down heavily for October. This is the fourth week in a row that the Dow has closed with losses, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index is down over 5% this month.
The doom and gloom from Europe (especially Germany ) and Ebola remain. Even China is showing signs of slower growth. There's concern they could drag the U.S. economy down.
James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, told Bloomberg News on Thursday that the Fed should weigh delaying the end to quantitative easing, or QE. The bond-buying experiment has helped send stocks to record highs, but it was set to end this month.
The reality is the Fed can't do much right now. Interest rates are at historic lows near zero. Europe went so far as to cut interest rates to negative levels this year, but that has done little to stimulate the economy there. Investors understand that when a central bank takes such dramatic actions, it's a sign of big trouble.

"I view the probability of the final QE3 winddown being delayed as somewhere between 0 and 1%," wrote Tim Anderson, managing director of MND Partners, in a morning note. "The market is already set up for a decent bounce, a high ranking Fed member basically says 'If this gets really bad we'll be there.'"
What's next? What can really turn this market around isn't the Fed, it's strong corporate earnings. Investors need to focus on whether or not companies are growing.
There were positive signs Friday morning. And there's a slew of earnings coming in the next two weeks, including big names such as Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) and Coca-Cola ( KO ). If those business "report cards" are mostly positive, it's likely to put traders and investors at ease.
A lot of strategists believe the U.S. economy is still growing and companies are sitting on a lot of cash , which helps them get through any rocky periods and enables them to invest in new equipment and programs.
"Various indicators suggest that the U.S. is about halfway through what should rival its longest expansion ever," Chris Hyzy, U.S. Trust's chief investment officer, wrote in a report this week.
On the upside, unemployment is back under 6% and jobless claims came in this week at the lowest level since 2000. According to figures released Friday, Consumer Confidence hit its highest level in seven years this month, although the reading was taken before the worst of the market dip.
There's an easy case to make that October, while scary for stocks, could turn out to be a blip in a long bull market.

The $40 billion jet buying spree - IndiGo s ...Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI/PARIS: Almost four years ago a handful of people gathered in Airbus sales chief John Leahy's spacious country house outside Toulouse and argued long into the evening over curry and cigars.
Last weekend they met up again at a Parisian hotel for more haggling, with breaks taken at a nearby cafe where the informality of old business friendships mingled with hard-nosed negotiations typical of the aircraft industry.
The sum total of money discussed over these meals? About $40 billion at catalogue prices, and the bill was for 430 jets, all sold to the same Indian airline -- IndiGo, the low-cost carrier which has grown to become the country's biggest airline in eight years of operating.
Represented according to insiders by co-founder Rakesh Gangwal and President Aditya Ghosh, IndiGo has now made aircraft industry history twice in four years -- each time by placing record orders for Airbus planes, including last Wednesday's announcement that it will buy 250 A320neo jets.
The largest order in India's aviation history is IndiGo's most aggressive bet yet that Indian air travel is on the cusp of a huge expansion, and that the model that made it the nation's only profitable carrier will keep working as competition intensifies.
"IndiGo is showing us the level of confidence it has in its own sustainability, in the long-term growth of aviation and in the future performance of the Indian economy ," said Harsh Vardhan, chairman at Delhi-based Starair Consulting .
Airline industry executives are hoping India's weak economy will rebound under new Prime Minister Narendra Modi and that the government will press for cuts to jet fuel tax and build more airports, slashing costs and opening up new markets.
Higher disposable incomes, an expanding middle class and rapid urbanisation have made India one of the world's fastest-growing domestic aviation markets, where passenger numbers are expected to grow by more than 75 percent in the next six years to exceed 217 million.
According to Airbus executive vice-president and the president of its India operations Kiran Rao, optimism about growth in Indian aircraft demand is rising.
But few airlines have translated that optimism into new orders on the scale of IndiGo's since most are losing money.
"People are too focused on India's negatives. IndiGo is aware of the challenges and it is adept at steering itself around them. That is how it became India's largest carrier," said one source familiar with the airline's thinking.
"There is, however, a great deal of optimism about the future within the airline and that comes right from the top."
Ghosh told Reuters last week India was a "highly underpenetrated market" and that a lot of the new planes would be for growth rather than replacing older aircraft.
STAYING IN PROFIT
Despite more Indians flying, fierce competition and high costs have left airlines including SpiceJet , Jet Airways and state-run Air India losing cash fast. The sector will lose up to $1.4 billion more this financial year, according to consultancy CAPA.

US plane on secret mission returns to Earth after 22 months in orbitUS plane on secret mission returns to Earth after 22 months in orbit
IANS
Los Angeles, October 18, 2014
First Published: 17:53 IST(18/10/2014)

After spending about 22 months orbiting the Earth on a secret mission, a US Air Force X-37B unmanned, reusable space plane has finally returned.
The spacecraft which blasted off in December 2012 for its third space mission touched down at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base Friday, Xinhua reported.
"The mission is our longest to date and we're pleased with the incremental progress we've seen in our testing of the reusable space plane," the US Air Force said in a statement.
Picture provided by the US Air Force shows personnel inspecting the X-37B after landing on December 3, 2010 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. (AFP Photo handout-US Air Force)
The programme is being run by the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office, and there are two space planes in the fleet, both built in tight secrecy by Boeing.
The X-37B space planes look much like NASA's retired space shuttles, only much smaller.
Each X-37B spacecraft is about 8.8 metres long and 4.5 metres wide.
The aim of the spacecraft is to "demonstrate a reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform for the US Air Force," the statement added.

Anniversary recap: Why we loved the Saifeena weddingThe Wedding Story of Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor
Bollywoodshaadis.com –  Thu 16 Oct, 2014 2:22 PM IST
Share 0
After a five-year relationship, when Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor finally decided to settle down, the celebrations were unmatched. Style, luxury and regal were the keywords of this high-profile wedding that had the shutterbugs on their toes. As their blissful union completes two years, we recall the magnificent moments from the big fat wedding that crossed religious and age boundaries. Let us unfurl the story of the Bollywood’s chotte Nawab and his Begum, Kareena Kapoor Khan.
Love beyond the boundaries
Kareena was born in a Punjabi Hindu family to yesteryear actors Babita and Randhir Kapoor. Whereas, Saif spent his childhood in a Muslim atmosphere, being the son of Nawab Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore. Even though they both are following different faith and have different upbringing, their marriage broke the narrow prism of religion, culture and even age.
The couple decided to tie the knot with due respect to each other’s religious views. In the earlier marriages of the Pataudi family, women have converted into Islam to marry their significant other. Saif’s mother Sharmila did so too. But, Kareena was not up for any such religious conversion and her decision was backed by her beau. Apart from love, it seems tolerance and acceptance is the key reasons behind this beautiful inter-faith union.

Jab they met
Saif and Kareena’s love story led to a lot of tabloid fodder. Prince fell in love with princess Kapoor, on the sets of movie Tashan. Though their chemistry onscreen was not that powerful, but their real life love became quite fascinating for all. They started dating in October 2007 when Kareena-Shahid's relationship was at its bitter end. They had an instant attraction, and slowly and steadily fell in love.

Their Wedding Hoopla
Five years and numerous wedding speculations later, the two got married on October 16, 2012. This star-studded affair lasted for an entire week. Take a look:
Sangeet Evening
The wedding carnival of this power couple kick-started with a grand sangeet ceremony. The bride and the groom’s families and friends got together to celebrate the outset of a new bonding. The evening was marked with music, dance and masti. The terrace party was held at Kareena’s Bandra residence. Buddies Malaika Arora Khan, Amrita Arora, Shakeel Ladak and Tusshar Kapoor shimmied to well-choreographed moves by Karan Johar. There was an array of dance performances to popular Bollywood numbers dedicated to the lovely couple. The terrace venue was covered to prevent media getting a snoop.
Here is a special video where you can see who all attended Kareena and Saif's sangeet ceremony, and who wore what? Take a look:

Mehendi Ki Raat
The next chapter of the wedding celebration was marked by the colour of henna. Kareena in a pretty pink saree set the tone and note for the mehendi ceremony, where Saif looked dapper in a tuxedo. The mehendi ceremony was coupled with a private dinner for family and friends, which took place in Mumbai’s Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.

A Registered Marriage
Apart from the ritual-rich and crowded ceremonies, what united the couple eternally was the formalisation of marriage with paperwork. A simple registered marriage took place at Saif’s residence.
Exchanging of Vows
Earlier it was rumoured that the couple would go for a nikaah. But, on the D-day we got to see their secular outlook towards their marriage. They just exchanged vows at the Taj Mahal Hotel. There were no `saath pheras` and they did not follow any particular style of wedding. The marriage was more about breaking the stereotype. As we said before, Kareena did not change her religion after her marriage. She only went on to change her last name, and is now known as Kareena Kapoor Khan.

After-wedding Dinner
The after-marriage bash was a vibrant affair. Around 150 selected guests attended the celebration. B-town celebs like Shah Rukh Khan with wife Gauri, Sonam Kapoor with dad Anil Kapoor, Amrita Arora with husband Shakeel Ladak, Priety Zinta, Karan Johar, Tusshar Kapoor, and many more upped the starry quotient of the evening. Family members including Randhir Kapoor, Babita, Karisma Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor with wife Neetu Singh, Ranbir Kapoor, Soha Ali Khan, along with Saif’s daughter Sara and son Ibrahim were seen in a joyous mood.
Well, here is a small leaked video that will tell you who all attended Saif and Kareena's grand wedding reception in Mumbai:

Dawat-e-Walima
A traditional dawat-e-walima was organised by Sharmila Tagore in Delhi. This traditional Muslim ceremony is a way of introducing the newlywed couple to the society. This also marked the culmination of a five-day wedding gala. Celebrities from the world of cricket, Bollywood and politics graced the Mughal-themed reception. The bungalow decorated in cream and gold, antique props, jasmine floral decor and traditional brass hanging diyas added a delicate spice and romance to the wedding ambiance.

Saif’s children and sister Soha accompanied the newlywed to the mansion, along with mother Sharmila Tagore.

Congress-mukt Bharat India s grand old party is strugglingComments
For the Congress, which has ruled India for more than 50 of its 67 years since Independence, the latest defeats in Maharashtra and Haryana will again force another bout of soul-searching.
India's grand old party, surely, has lot to soul-search about lately. Nationally, it has been reduced to 44 seats in the Lok Sabha. Now, it is fast losing control over states as well.
The party is now in power in only 11 of India's 29 states, two of them in alliance with regional parties.          
The party is now in the saddle only in Karnataka, Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir.
What's more, there are worrying signs in Jammu and Kashmir, where it has parted ways with ally National Conference for the next assembly elections.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has made "Congress-mukt Bharat" (Congress-free India) one of its political battle cries, is sitting pretty at the moment.
The BJP is steadily making inroads into Congress bastions and is facing little challenge.
Congress supporters waiting for decisive moves after the Lok Sabha elections debacle are still waiting. There are few signs of a stirring comeback.
All talk of old guard, new guard will do little to enthuse party workers not used being floored election after election.
Revelling in BJP's not-so-stellar show in a handful of by-elections is only a fleeting celebration of success.
At this point in time, the Congress does not look willing to make a fight of it.

I-T report pegs Qureshi s tax evasion at Rs ...I-T appraisal report pegs Moin Akhtar Qureshi's tax evasion at Rs 200 crore
PTI Oct 19, 2014, 02.46PM IST

Moin Akhtar Qureshi
(Sources in the department…)
NEW DELHI: An appraisal report prepared by the I-T department against controversial meat exporter Moin Akhtar Qureshi has pegged an alleged evasion of Rs 200 crore by his business firms.
Sources in the department said the probe wing has finalised the report, which was presented to the Supreme Court on Friday.
It has now sent it for final tax assessment after which the businessman and his firms will be issued notices, they said.
"The appraisal report has pegged the tax evasion by Qureshi's firms to be about Rs 200 crore in the last two years. However, this is just an analysis report and the final legal notice for the evasion will be sent by the central wing of the department after assessment," a senior I-T official said.
Qureshi did not respond to repeated calls and messages sent to his mobile phone.
According to I-T procedures, after the investigations wing of the department prepares an appraisal report in a tax evasion case, it subsequently sends its findings to the central directorate which then issues the final notice to the assessee.
The sources said the case in which searches were conducted in February this year, pertains to alleged "under reporting" of profits by Qureshi's firms which are primarily involved into meat processing, selling and exporting businesses.
An appraisal report submitted by the I-T department to the apex court last week on Qureshi said there are "astonishing" state of affairs between him and a previous CBI Director.
It said Singh allegedly used to have conversation with the businessman on a daily basis in code on issues including helping accused in some cases.
Although Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi did not name the ex-CBI Director, but the reference was seen as towards A P Singh as the top law officer said the former agency chief is now a member of UPSC.
Mentioning some details of the I-T report, which he claimed was only a "trailer and the real movie is awaited", Rohatgi said the former director allegedly used to have conversation with Qureshi on a daily basis in code through BlackBerry Messenger service on issues including helping accused in some cases.
Rohatgi said the taxman had raided Qureshi after his conversations with others were tapped and on the basis of the raid the appraisal report was prepared which is not a statutory document but an analysis.
The report, running in four volumes, was prepared on the basis of documents and material seized by the department. It was placed in a sealed envelope before a bench comprising justices Madan B Lokur, Kurien Joseph and A K Sikri.
The bench said it will go through the report and documents placed by the AG and hold the next hearing on December 8.

Possible scenarios after hung house in MaharashtraPossible scenarios after hung house in Maharashtra
HT Correspondents , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, October 19, 2014
First Published: 12:12 IST(19/10/2014) | Last Updated: 17:25 IST(19/10/2014)
Comments
Though the BJP has emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra, the fractured mandate has thrown up different possibilities. Shiv Sena is the BJP’s most likely suitor, though the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) could also have a say. The smaller parties and Independents are unlikely to make up for the BJP’s deficit.
Scenario 1
BJP, expected to finish with around 115 seats, ties up with the Shiv Sena, which was leading in 63 seats at noon. This would mean that the BJP would not be in a commanding position and will have to bargain with the Sena for chief ministership and portfolios.
Scenario 2
BJP ties up with the NCP, which was leading in 43 seats at noon. A number of compromises will be involved if this were to happen, especially given the BJP’s continuous tirade against the NCP over corruption. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said Sunday it will offer legislative support to a BJP government in Maharashtra. Speaking after the election results produced a hung assembly, NCP leader Praful Patel said his party was ready to offer "outside support" to a Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state. The BJP said that it will examine the NCP's offer of outside support to help it form a government in Maharashtra and take a decision on it.

BJP to form govt in Maharashtra: Shah | Liveblog | CoverageAmit Shah
(BJP President Shah said…)
NEW DELHI: BJP today gave enough indications that it was not averse to the outside support offered by NCP and made it clear that it will be going ahead with formation of government in Maharashtra.
"As per norms of democracy, the largest party has the right to form the government. BJP will be forming the government in Maharashtra ," party President Amit Shah told a press conference here as the results showed that BJP will fall short of a majority.
Virtually ignoring its erstwhile ally Shiv Sena, he said that the NCP has on its own offered "unconditional outside" support and "does not want to join the government".
Asked specifically what would the BJP do on NCP's offer, Shah said, "Just wait for sometime. The (BJP) Parliamentary Board will be meeting shortly."

BJP hits century in Maharashtra; first party to do so since 1990
PTI Oct 19, 2014, 05.06PM IST
Tags:
Bal Thackeray
(BJP's record is impressive…)
NEW DELHI: Riding on the Narendra Modi wave, BJP has crossed the century mark in the Assembly polls in Maharashtra, a feat last time achieved by Congress in 1990.
Making deep inroads into Congress and NCP bastions, BJP is set to get over 120 seats this time in the 288-member House, a development that could jolt the Shiv Sena, which was its 'elder brother' in the saffron alliance that collapsed before the polls.
In the 1990 Assembly polls, Congress had secured as many as 141 seats. Since then, no national or regional party had come anywhere near the 100 mark.
Though the party has failed to reach the halfway mark of 144, BJP's record is impressive this time as it is getting nearly three times the seats it secured in 2009 Assembly polls when its tally was 47.
The BJP tally this time is more than the combined figure of 92 seats it had won along with the Shiv Sena in the last polls. This indicated that the gamble played by the Prime Minister Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah has more than paid off.
The two parties had together secured as many as 138 seats in 1995 (BJP-65, Shiv Sena-73) when they had formed the first non-Congress coalition government in the state.
In 1990, the first assembly polls jointly contested by the BJP and Shiv Sena had seen the BJP secure just 42 seats out of 104 it contested and Shiv Sena won 52 out of the 183 alloted to it.
Former BJP leader late Pramod Mahajan was the architect of the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance-- the oldest ideological partnership of the BJP.
With Mahajan striking a rapport with late Bal Thackeray-- the Shiv Sena supremo had offered the Deputy Chief Ministership to the national party, which was till recently playing the second fiddle in the state.
In 1985, BJP contested 67 Assembly seats and had won only 16 when the Congress dominance was at its peak after the assassination of the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
At that time, Congress had won 161 out of the 287 seats it contested, securing 43.55 per cent votes.
With Sharad Pawar parting ways with Congress in 1999, the Congress vote got divided and since then, the party was sharing power with the NCP for last 15 years.
The Lok Sabha polls earlier this year changed the political complexion of Maharashtra with BJP and its allies capturing 42 out of 48 seats in the state, the second-largest after Uttar Pradesh having 80 seats.

Election lesson for BJP: advantage  but not hegemonyComments
Sunday morning brought cheer to the BJP party office in Chandigarh--where the party turned the tables in Haryana politics by leapfrogging to achieve a decisive majority in the state. It brought hope, laced with disappointment, in Mumbai--where the BJP is comfortably the single largest party, but will need support to form the government. It also brought visible celebrations to the party’s central office at New Delhi’s Ashoka Road, but with the realisation among national leaders that the mixed verdict would throw up newer questions about the party’s future strategy.

The BJP replicated key elements of the campaign strategy that had yielded such rich dividends in the Lok Sabha polls.
These included an appetite for political risk, where they broke a 25-year-old alliance with Shiv Sena and went alone in Haryana. It included showcasing the Narendra Modi brand through relentless and energetic rallies, meticulous organization by Amit Shah, wheeling out cabinet ministers to take charge of cluster of constituencies, a media blitzkrieg, reconfiguring the entrenched caste calculus of a particular state’s polity and carving out new social alliances.
The strategy yielded success, but the Lok Sabha results have set the bar so high that anything less than outright majority now looks like a setback.
Read: BJP’s big leap in Maharashtra but short of a mandate
In Haryana, no one--not even rivals--can take away credit from BJP’s impressive victory. Congress, after a decade in power, had become synonymous with corruption and crony capitalism favoring select companies. It did not help that Congress was wrecked with internal rifts. Anti incumbency was rampant, and the question was who would benefit from it. Regional parties, including the Indian National Lok Dal led by Om Prakash Chautala, were relatively discredited. Chautala himself was locked in, and used bail time to campaign. For its part, the BJP had built up an impressive party machinery and decided to turn the old caste equations on its head by mobilizing the non-Jat social groups in the state. Irrespective of who becomes CM, the party has redefined Haryana politics for now. BJP has clearly replaced the Bhajan Lal clan represented now by HJC’s Kuldeep Bishnoi as the leading non Jat formation of the state.
In Maharashtra, there were certain structural conditions common to Haryana. Anti incumbency was rampant; the Congress-NCP coalition in power was seen as closely associated with corruption; and there were strong regional formations.
To understand the scale of BJP’s victory, remember that it was the junior partner in the alliance with SS for decades. It did not have strong political presence in over 150 constituencies out of 288. The tables have turned. In less than a month of rigorous campaigning, it has emerged as the single largest party – outsmarting Congress, the Maratha strongman Sharad Pawar, and SS. Raj Thackeray’s MNS lies decimated.
But this success is only partial. The BJP’s go alone strategy seems to have hit its limits here, for it will need to eat humble pie and return to its ally Shiv Sena to seek support to form the government. This is a setback, for one of Modi’s key campaign cries was how only a majority government – not a coalition – could lead to development. The party won fewer seats than what Lok Sabha trends had suggested for the assembly. Maharashtra defied an increasing trend in recent polls in India – of voters providing a decisive verdict. There will be no single party hegemony, and the politics of give and take and coalitions will continue to govern the Mumbai ethos.  
It is also a testament to how drastically Indian politics has changed in the past six months that what was unthinkable a year ago – an outright win for BJP in Haryana and a decisive edge in Maharashtra – now looks like a mixed success.

193 have died due to my  present situation : JayalalithaaComments
Former Tamil Nadu chief minister, who is out on bail after being convicted in a corruption case, on Sunday claimed 193 people had died in the state because of  her "present situation" which she compared to "swimming in a sea of inferno".
Putting up a brave front, Jayalalithaa assured party workers that she will come out of the present case as she had successfully faced many challenges.
In her first statement after walking out of the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison at Bangalore on Saturday, the former chief minister said she had been facing challenges in life for long.
"I have successfully come out of them. With your love and the grand support of the people of Tamil Nadu by my side, I am not going to be cowed down or lose heart," said Jayalalithaa, who was sentenced to four years in prison in the Rs. 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case.
"My public life amounts to swimming in a sea of inferno.
As your dear sister, I have realised the perils of dedicating oneself for the cause of public welfare from the day I entered politics," the 66-year-old leader said.
Recalling that her mentor and party founder MG Ramachandran had secured an assurance from her that she will dedicate herself in leading AIADMK, she said she was living by that promise.
The welfare of AIADMK and its workers, particularly the well-being of people of Tamil Nadu, were her prime goals and she continued to walk this path unmindful of the "challenges, grief and pain" she could  face in this process, as "God has given me the maturity to take such pains in my stride."
She assured the party workers she will meet their expectations besides continuing to work for the welfare of the people of the state.
Jayalalithaa claimed 193 persons had died due to her "present situation," and expressed concern over three other persons attempting suicide. The party released the list of the 193 deceased persons, saying 139 of them died of heart attack while the rest ended their lives.
Expressing her sympathies with the families of the deceased, she announced a relief of Rs. three lakh to each of them even as she said the party will provide Rs. 50,000 each for the three persons towards medical treatment.
She urged supporters not to take any such extreme steps and also thanked all those who had prayed for her release.
After the Supreme Court granted her bail in the case, Jayalalithaa was released on bail on Saturday, arriving to a grand homecoming with scores of supporters turning up to welcome her despite heavy rain.

Gujarat: BJP wins Rajkot-West assembly seatComments
BJP on Sunday retained the Rajkot-West assembly seat by winning the bye-election with a margin of over 23,000 votes. "BJP candidate Vijay Rupani won Rajkot-West assembly seat by a margin of 23,740 votes at the end of the final 19th round," Deputy Election Officer Ketan Gandhi said in Rajkot.

Rupani got 81,092 votes, while Congress candidate Jayanti Kalaria managed 57,352 votes. Interestingly, voters in the seat chose NOTA (None of the Above) as the third alternative, as 3,110 votes were polled in its favour.
NCP candidate Bhavesh Lokhil stood fourth with 1,027 votes. The remaining candidates could not cross the three-digit mark. There were nine candidates, including six
independents, in fray apart from the nominees of BJP, Congress and NCP.
However, the main electoral battle was between Congress and BJP. As per the figures of the Election Commission, out of the total 2.90 lakh registered voters in the seat, 1.42 lakh exercised their franchise during the bypoll.
The seat, once represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had then entered Gujarat politics, fell vacant following the resignation of sitting MLA Vaju Vala after he was appointed Governor of Karnataka. The constituency has been BJP's pocket-borough since 1990.
Gujarat chief minister Anandi Patel recently said that the Rajkot-West by-poll was an issue of prestige for BJP and had asked the party workers to work hard to retain it.
Soon after the victory, Patel thanked the people of Rajkot and also congratulated the winner, on her twitter post.
"Thankful to people of Rajkot for reposing their trust in BJP in assembly by-election & Congratulations to Shri Vijay Rupani for the victory," she tweeted.
Rupani gave all the credit to BJP workers for the win. "It is only because of the hard work of the BJP workers that the party has succeeded in retaining its bastion.
People of Rajkot did not fall for the negative propaganda of Congress and they cast their votes as per their understanding.
This is the result of that," Rupani said.
When asked whether he sees any post in chief minister Anandi Patel-led state government, he said, "I have been serving people for so many years and will be doing the same in the future also without having any desire for any post."  Meanwhile, Congress nominee Jayanti Kalaria accepted the defeat and said he will continue to raise the issues of poor water-supply and deteriorating condition of law and order in Rajkot.

Congress critical  needs change in political lifestyle to surviveCongress critical, needs change in political lifestyle to survive
Vinod Sharma , Hindustan Times   October 19, 2014
First Published: 18:56 IST(19/10/2014) | Last Updated: 21:49 IST(19/10/2014)

The BJP’s victory in Maharashtra might be pyrrhic. But it’s no reason for the Congress to rejoice. The outcome of assembly polls in the state and Haryana is for the party a replication of the 2014 Lok Sabha results.
In neither province is the Congress even the second largest party - leave alone being anywhere close to getting recognised as the principal Opposition in Haryana. Trailing behind the INLD there and the Shiv Sena - that logged the second highest tally in Maharashtra -- its rump status is beyond doubt. So is its political isolation.
The NCP, which parted company with the Congress just before elections, made a paradigm shift soon after the poll picture became clear. It announced “unconditional” outside support for the BJP, stranded a step away from a simple majority in the 288-strong legislature. The move illustrated the adage that “self-interest” is the only constant in politics.
Regardless of the BJP’s response, the unilateral NCP overture is proof as much of its opportunism as of the Congress’s depleted political relevance. The nine states that it now governs have a bare 77 seats in Parliament.
Compare that with the BJP’s expanse. It rules on its own strength or shares power with regional allies in MP, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Haryana, Punjab, Andhra and Maharashtra.
The BJP-RSS are breathing down the Congress’s neck even in the three relatively bigger states where it has power: Karnataka, Kerala and Assam. The vulnerability of its political base there is too tangible to be missed.
The saffron parivar has strong ground-level presence in Karnataka that it once ruled, and is well on the way to building a formidable base in Assam. Kerala looks an exception to the rule. But there too, the BJP surprised itself by standing second in the 2014 Thiruvananthapuram parliamentary polls.
Of greater political significance are instances of CPM cadres shifting loyalty to the saffron camp in Kerala. Many observers consider that a fallout of the Marxists’ subtle application of religious glue to keep their backward Hindu base against the Congress’s Christian-Muslim-forward caste social amalgam.
If the Congress indeed is critically ill, these are signs of potential multiple organ failure. About time it stopped refusing treatment, entail as it may not just life-saving surgery but a radically changed political lifestyle.
The sooner it happens, the better. For around the corner are elections to assemblies in Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir. An unequal contest these might be -- the BJP high on steroids, the Congress needing the elixir of life.

Single  successful: BJP upsets alliance politicsComments
The results of the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections have set the stage for what could turn out to be a turning point in the country’s politics with the BJP poised to take on a host of regional parties in state elections in the next one-and-a-half years.
  
Play Pause

With BJP president Amit Shah’s gamble of going it alone paying off in the latest assembly elections, the party is likely to follow the template in future elections starting with Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand in the next few weeks and Bihar next year. While the BJP allied with regional parties in the past, it has never been coy about its preference for bipolar polity.
After it vanquished the Congress in the parliamentary election and now its traditional strongholds of Haryana and Maharashtra, the BJP will be inclined to ride on the continuing Narendra Modi wave to end the dominance of regional players. The BJP had never contested more than 26 seats in Haryana and more than 119 in Maharashtra; the party’s tally in these two states post-results leaves no ambiguity about the success of Shah’s bold, if risky, strategy.
According to party sources, if there has to be an alliance--like the one with the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) of Ramvilas Paswan and the Rashtriya Lok Samata party (RLSP) of Upendra Kushwaha in Bihar--the BJP will not be a junior party in it.
Most immediately, the BJP’s massive win may mean shrinking bargaining space for JVM(P) leader Babulal Marandi in Jharkhand, who had rejected the BJP’s offer of a merger and has been playing hardball in back channel talks for an alliance.
Further down the road, regional parties are also likely to face the heat in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry which are set to go to the polls early in 2016.
In Assam, the BJP will be inclined to replace its erstwhile ally AGP to mount a challenge to the ruling Congress. Similarly, given the visible surge in its support base in West Bengal in the Lok Sabha election, the party will be looking to elbow out the Left and the Congress to emerge as the principal challenger to the ruling Trinamool Congress.
The success of the go-it-alone policy in Haryana and Maharashtra is also likely to have a bearing on political equations in Punjab where coalition partner BJP is learnt to be uneasy about people’s growing disillusionment with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).

Top SME news of the week    Top SME news of the week
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | October 09, 2014 16:46 IST
The bank, which largely assists large corporations is moving to open branches dedicated solely to SME needs.
State Bank Of India (SBI) to lend support to SMEs
 
India's top most bank and lender, State Bank of India (SBI) is shifting its focus on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) now. The bank, which largely assists large corporations is moving to open branches dedicated solely to SME needs. SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya said that the bank's earlier model failed to perform due to lack of ownership. Hence, they have decided to open branches that will be completely dedicated to SMEs. Off late, banks have recorded higher defaults from larger corporates as against the SMEs. This meant that the SMEs clearly have potential that needs to be unlocked. The planned branches will not only appraise SMEs but will also monitor post sanction of loans.
 
Two day power holiday in telangana will hurt SMEs
 
The Telangana State government has declared two-day weekly power holiday for industries in the region. This will translate into losses for Rs. 10,000 crore valued SME industry in the state. President of Telangana Industrialists' Federation K Sudheer Reddy said that power holidays will impact SMEs through production cut and increased Idle hours of workers at the industries. The state has been facing acute power shortage this year, which forced the government to increase the power holiday from 1 day to 2 day.
 
SEBI to roll out SME-Friendly measures
 
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)'s Chairman U.K. Sinha indicated that the regulatory body will introduce measures with the aim to help SME sector in sourcing funds. Mr. Sinha said that the SEBI's previous measures in the year 2003 and 2009 failed to meet the ends, but certain measures from 2012 showed positive impact. Mr. Sinha highlighted that within a period of two years nearly 71 companies listed under the SME category and were able to source Rs. 600 crore of funding. Mr. Sinha estimates that the market capital of this segment should be in between Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 3,000 crore.

It’s a vote for change not for Narendra ModiOctober 19, 2014, 12:57 pm IST Rajesh Ramachandran in Polibelly | India , Times View | ET
53
The Maharashtra polls have proven beyond any doubt that there is no surge of game-changing goodwill in favour of any one political person, any longer. Had there been a Modi wave or tsunami, BJP should have won a comfortable majority or, at the very least, it should have come close to the half way mark of 145.
Congress had conceded defeat before the polls had begun with the half-hearted campaign never taking off. Sharad Pawar’s NCP had ensured that there would be no alliance with Congress, thereby facilitating a four-cornered contest that favoured BJP. And Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray was no match for Prime Minister Narendra Modi nor were the Sena’s strategists, in the absence of Bal Thackeray, a patch on the BJP-RSS combine.
Yet, Modi’s 25-30 election campaign rallies, the most done by any leader in these assembly polls, could not take the party to simple majority. So, the results only reflect the mood of the people of the state after 15 years of Congress-NCP rule, mired in allegations of corruption. People wanted change and they got it.
Just five months ago, Sena and BJP had won 42 out of 48 seats in the Lok Sabha polls and this should have translated itself into about 260 MLAs in the 288-seat strong assembly. BJP, which had won 23 out of the 24 Lok Sabha constituencies, should have retained about 130 seats in the assembly on its own. But both Sena and BJP could not repeat their performances in the Lok Sabha polls proving once again that the mood of the nation has changed in the last four months.
Sure, the voters have voted out the Congress-NCP government. But the defeat is not as comprehensive as it was, say, in Rajasthan or Delhi last year or Haryana now. In fact the Maharashtra defeat of the Congress-NCP combine is no endorsement of a Modi wave, but a big swing in favour of the most viable political alternative. And if Sena and BJP had stayed together, they would have swept the polls repeating the earlier Lok Sabha performance.
In Haryana the only viable option was BJP, not Congress with the Vadra-Hooda scandals and not definitely a party led by someone in jail for corruption. When corruption is the poll plank, the corrupt have to be voted out and the Haryana poll results only signify the success of the anti-corruption election campaign. Probably, even AAP, as self-proclaimed anti-corruption crusaders, could have made a mark in the Haryana assembly elections had they contested polls.
It always feels good to say, ‘I told you so.’ After BJP’s dismal performance in the assembly by-polls in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, I had written on September 16 that the Modi wave had ebbed. http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Polibelly/modi-wave-is-over/

Carl Icahn Lost $200 Million On Netflix OvernightThis article originally appeared in Business Insider .
Carl Icahn has lost $200 million on Netflix stock since Wednesday, when the company's stock plunged 27 percent in after-hour trading.
Advertisement
It all fell apart when Netflix reported subscriber growth in its third-quarter earnings report that was lower than expected. Then it cut its growth expectations for the fourth quarter.
It didn't help either that HBO chose Wednesday to announce that it would launch a streaming-only content service by next year.
Icahn owns almost 1.8 million shares of Netflix, according to government filings dating back to June 30.
This could all be much worse for Icahn. He sold off a lot of Netflix stock last October, making $647 million and cutting his stake in half.
"It's sort of an Icahn rule," he said in an interview after the sale, "when you make 5x your money, it doesn't mean you're not a long termer ... you take some chips off the table ... The model of Netflix is an excellent one and it's very hard to compete ... it took me 20 minutes to say, this is going to be one of greats of all time."
Icahn isn't the largest holder of the stock, either. That's Coatue Management, a hedge fund helmed by Philippe Laffont. Coatue holds over two million shares of Netflix.
Netflix added two million international subscribers vs. expectations of 2.36 million and 975,000 domestic streaming subscriptions vs. expectations of 1.33 million.
In the chart below, you can see how Netflix's new estimation of subscriber growth for the next quarter diverges even farther from the rest of Wall Street's estimates ( from Estimize ).
The company's guidance looks as if it's falling off a cliff. 
Estimize
Hastings told CNBC's Julie Boostein that he believed the decline in subscriber growth was due to a $1 price increase back in May.
"Our best sense is it's an effect of our price increase back in May," Hastings said. "With a little bit higher prices, you get a little bit fewer subscribers. So that's our sense of it. But we can't be 100 percent sure. We had so much benefit from Orange in Q2 and the early Q3, but that's what we think."
Hastings said that the news about HBO was "exciting" and that though it would be a big competitor for the long term, customers would most likely subscribe to both HBO and Netflix. HBO's price point for its service has not been announced.
Either way, it's important to keep in mind that HBO is bigger internationally than Netflix. Netflix has 53 million members worldwide to HBO's 120 million.
That's a part of the story that could have investors spooked for a while.

Maharashtra and Haryana won  BJP to now target DelhiMaharashtra and Haryana won, BJP to now target Delhi

The BJP’s focus may shift to Delhi after its stunning victory in Haryana and Maharasthtra, but the party is still undecided on whether to cash in on the wins and go to the polls or form a government with some rebel MLAs.

Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung is expected to soon spell out his decision on Delhi which has been without a government since the Aam Admi Party (AAP) stepped down in February. 
“We are waiting for the L-G’s response.  We will apply our mind on this after getting an invitation from him,” said a senior BJP leader.
Maharashtra tangle: Who stands where, what next for the key forces
One section of the BJP feels the party should face fresh polls in Delhi after the Haryana and Maharashtra results reinforced a continuing Modi wave.
But another section believes the situation in Delhi is different from Maharashtra and Haryana where the government faced strong anti-incumbency. The Congress-NCP combine was in power in Maharasthtra for 15 years while the Congress ruled Haryana for 10 years.
Some party leaders believe the Aam Admi Party’s (AAP) popularity may not have waned even though it did not win a single seat in Delhi in the last Lok Sabha election. Although the middle class swung to the BJP in the general election, there are no signs yet that the AAP’s core middle and lower class base has abandoned the party yet.
The Lok Sabha victory tempted the BJP to consider a fresh poll in Delhi instead of forming a government with the support of rebels from the Congress, but the AAP’s higher vote share in the general election and lack of a chief ministerial face triggered second thoughts.
The AAP increased its vote share in the Lok Sabha poll by 3.4% cent over its assembly figures, while the BJP’s gain between these two polls was a whopping 13.3%. Party leaders attributed the jump to what they called the “‘Modi magic”.
The BJP has 28 MLAs in the Delhi assembly, whose effective strength has been reduced to 67. It Along with a lone Shiromani Akali Dal MLA, it is counting on the support of two independent legislators and a couple of others from the Congress to form a government.

The West Midlands-based luxury carmaker is reportedly talking to several southern states of America, including South Carolina, about building a plant in the US, The Sunday Times claimed today.
JLR is capitalising on a turnaround in its fortunes after Tata acquired the struggling brand for around 1.3 billion pounds back in 2008.
It is all set to open a 130,000-vehicle factory in China on Tuesday and later this month will launch its i54 engine plant in Wolverhampton - a 500-million-pound investment.
It has also signed a deal for a new factory in Brazil and is exploring three possible locations in Wales for a new logistics hub, though it is also considering a site in the Midlands.
Selling directly into the US would allow JLR to avoid high import tariffs and smooth the impact of fluctuating currency rates.
The newspaper believes it would probably receive significant start-up support from the chosen state, and could commit itself to building a factory that will eventually produce 200,000 cars a year.
The company has also been exploring the possibility of opening a factory in Mexico.
JLR sold about 55,000 cars in North America last year, an eighth of its 425,000 global sales.
Its target is to reach 1 million cars by the end of the decade.

5 takeaways from the Maharashtra verdictComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the largest party in the state by winning 122 out of 288 seats and is all set to form the next government in Maharashtra. The party that contested all seats with its smaller allies after it breaking its 25-year old alliance with Shiv Sena fell short of 25 seats to win simple majority of its own. It now has an option to reunite with Sena that won 63 seats or get support of Sharad Pawar led NCP that won 41 seats. Attributing its historic victory to charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP national president Amit Shah announced that the party will form government in Maharashtra.
Here are five takeaways from Maharashtra verdict:
 
1. BJP is the biggest gainer; Shiv Sena the biggest loser: They parted ways barely days before polling and may get together again to form the government. The debate about the lead partner — “big brother” status as it is often referred to — is, however, clearly settled now. 
 
2. Verdict vindicates Narendra Modi’s appeal; going it alone not so bad after all: After largely staying away from campaigning for by-elections, where the BJP got a not-so-stellar performance, the Prime Minister addressed 27 rallies in Maharashtra ahead of polling.
 
3. Big boost for Amit Shah, his game plan pays off: The BJP president, for long Modi’s key backroom player, is coming into his own. The outcome in Maharashtra and Haryana overshadows by-election losses in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.    
 
4. Congress slide: Party loses control of India’s financial capital Mumbai, faces further marginalisation with no state under control across north, west, east and central India. Saving grace: Party may have lost half of the seats it won in Maharashtra in 2009, but it has cut losses in more than two-thirds of the constituencies where it trailed in April-May Lok Sabha elections.
 
5. Silver lining for Shiv Sena: It can claim to be the rightful inheritor of the Bal Thackeray legacy as Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has been rendered irrelevant.

5 takeaways from the Haryana verdictComments
The BJP on Sunday created political history in Haryana, by  being all set to form a government in the state for the first time on its own. The party, upsetting past trends, won 47 seats in the 90-member assembly. The party got 33.2% vote share in the state.
Here are the key takeaways from the elections in Haryana:
 
1. Big gainer BJP: Party rode the Narendra Modi momentum of the 2014 general election while crafting a new social engineering formula of consolidating non-Jat voters. Result--from 4 seats last time to 47 now (majority on its own) and power for the first time in the state.
 
2. Deft use of corruption plank: The BJP found ammunition in the controversial Robert Vadra-DLF deal to reinforce its charge of misrule against the Congress. Same handle came in handy to target the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), whose chief Om Prakash Chautala is in jail in a teachers' recruitment scam.
 
3. Ally must deliver or fall by the wayside: The BJP dumped its ally Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC), which had drawn a blank in the Lok Sabha polls. Convinced that Kuldeep Bishnoi's fledgling HJC has a weak grip on its traditional non-Jat vote bank, Amit Shah shrewdly used the wrangling over seat-sharing to break off the alliance.   
 
4. No takers for Khap leaders: Voters rejected Khap leaders as political representatives. Known to issue bizarre diktats, none of the Khap leaders in the fray found favour with the voters.
 
5. Jats stand by Hooda, Chautala: Amid the drubbing, outgoing chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and INLD supremo Chautala can take heart from the fact that the allegiance of Jats is still with them. Comprising 22% of the state's population, Jats account for more than one-fifth of the electorate.

Spotting India s largest Nandi statuesBigg Boss 8
On the Nandi Trail
Nandi, the sacred bull and the mount of Lord Shiva, is a familiar sight at any temple dedicated to Shiva. According to Hindu mythology, Nandi is the gate-keeper of Shiva and his most loyal attendant. It is believed that all your wishes come true if you whisper to Nandi before visiting his master. Pilgrims can be found circumambulating the statue and touching it. Women, especially, are said to benefit from touching Nandi as the bull is a symbol of fertility. Not surprisingly, bulls and cows find sanctuary at Shiva temples everywhere in India.
The following photo-series by VIKRAM RAMACHANDRAN represent some of the greatest monolithic Nandi sculptures in India, from the largest Nandi at Lepakshi, Andhra Pradesh, to the Nandi bulls at Brihadeesvara Temple, Thanjavur and Halebeedu, Karnataka. While admiring the Nandis, look around the temples where they are situated.

BJP set to form govt in Maha with NCP support | Liveblog | CoverageBJP
(BJP is set to form government…)
MUMBAI: Riding the crest of a Narendra Modi wave, BJP is set to form government in Maharashtra for the first time on its own with surprise "outside support" from NCP as the Assembly poll threw up a hung House with the party emerging a clear winner but falling short of a majority.
BJP's gamble of walking out of the alliance with 'big brother' Shiv Sena paid off as it secured 122 seats in the 288-member assembly, three more than the 119 offered by the erstwhile partner before the split and 76 more than what it had got in 2009.
It is for the first time since Congress' tally of 141 seats in 1990 that a party has crossed the 100-seats mark in an Assembly election in Maharashtra.
Though the Sena too improved upon its 2009 showing winning 63 seats, it still fell short of its best performance in the 1995 poll when it had won 73 seats going to the hustings together with BJP and forming a coalition government.
Posting its worst performance, Congress secured 42 seats and former ally NCP, with which it had ruled the state for 15 years in a row before the poll-eve split, clinching 41.
A big surprise in the election was the near obliteration of Raj Thackeray's MNS , which many thought will be the X-factor in the poll as it managed to win just one seat.
While the party, which pursued the 'Marathi pride' agenda with great fervour could clinch just one seat, Hyderabad-based MIM opened its account winning two seats.
Bahujan Vikas Aaghadi and Peasants and Workers Party won three seats each, while Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, CPI(M), Samajwadi Party and BJP ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha pocketed one each and independents won seven.

HKong street clashes erupt despite imminent ...Hong Kong street clashes erupt despite imminent talks

The worst political crisis in Hong Kong since Britain handed the free-wheeling city back to China in 1997 entered its fourth week with no sign of a resolution.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
HONG KONG: Violent clashes erupted in Hong Kong early on Sunday for a second night, deepening a sense of impasse between a government with limited options and a pro-democracy movement increasingly willing to confront police.
The worst political crisis in Hong Kong since Britain handed the free-wheeling city back to China in 1997 entered its fourth week with no sign of a resolution despite talks scheduled on Tuesday between the government and student protest leaders.
Beijing has signalled through Hong Kong's leaders that it is not willing to reverse a decision in late August that effectively denies the financial hub the full democracy the protesters are demanding for an election in 2017.
"Unless there is some kind of breakthrough in two hours of talks on Tuesday, I'm worried we will see the standoff worsen and get violent," Sonny Lo, a professor at the Hong Kong Institute of Education, told Reuters.
"We could be entering a new and much more problematic stage. I hope the government has worked out some compromises, because things could get very difficult now."
Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Leung Chun-ying, who has so far resisted calls to quit, said more time was needed to broker what he hoped would be a non-violent end to the upheaval.
"To work out a solution, to put an end to this problem, we need time. We need time to talk to the people, particularly young students," he told Hong Kong's ATV Television. "What I want is to see a peaceful and a meaningful end to this problem."
Hong Kong's 28,000 strong police have been struggling to contain a youth-led movement that has shown little sign of waning after three weeks of standoffs.
Roughly a thousand demonstrators in the Mong Kok district launched a fresh assault early on Sunday, putting on helmets and goggles before surging forward to grab a line of metal barricades hemming them into a section of road.
Scores of riot police had smashed batons at a wall of umbrellas that protesters raised to defend themselves. Amid shouts and hurled insults, violent scuffles erupted before police surged forward with shields, forcing the crowds back.
One activist in a white T-shirt and goggles was hit with a flurry of baton blows, leaving him bleeding from a gash in the head. Several protesters were taken away.
Dozens of people were reportedly injured in the two nights of clashes, including 22 police officers. Four people were arrested early on Sunday, police said.
The clashes came hours after the talks were confirmed for Tuesday. They will be broadcast live.
On Sunday evening, crowds again began building as protesters stockpiled helmets and fashioned home-made forearm shields out of foam pads to parry baton blows.
RESTIVE GENERATION
The protesters, led by a restive generation of students, have been demanding China's Communist Party rulers live up to constitutional promises to grant full democracy to the former British trading outpost.
Hong Kong is ruled under a "one country, two systems" formula that allows it wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms and specifies universal suffrage for Hong Kong as an eventual goal.
But Beijing is wary about copycat demands for reform on the mainland and it ruled on Aug. 31 it would screen candidates who want to run for the city's chief executive in 2017. Democracy activists said that rendered the universal suffrage concept meaningless. They are demanding elections with open nominations.
Leung appears hamstrung, unable to compromise because of the message that would send to people on the mainland while more force looks likely to only galvanize the young protesters.
Hong Kong's Security Chief Lai Tung-kwok said some of the clashes in recent days had been initiated by activists affiliated to "radical organisations which have been active in conspiring, planning and charging violent acts".
The city's embattled police chief, Andy Tsang, also expressed his frustration when he broke three weeks of silence on Saturday to say "extremely tolerant" policing had not stopped protests becoming more "radical or violent".
The demonstrations pose one of the biggest challenges for China since the crushing of a pro-democracy movement in Beijing in 1989.
The situation in Hong Kong surfaced in weekend talks between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi in Boston.
A senior State Department official said Hong Kong was discussed as part of "candid exchanges" on human rights while a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said Yang had told Kerry that Hong Kong was "purely an internal affair of China".
In Mong Kok, protesters resting during the day on Sunday were defiant and also angry that local officials were portraying their campaign as increasingly radicalised and violent.
While police took down some banners and posters, they left one of the more popular and dramatic, a cardboard cut-out of Leung being hanged in effigy from a lamp-post.
"I will continue to stay here until CY (Leung) resigns," said Lap Cheung, 40, who quit his IT job in the United States to return to Hong Kong for the protests, adding that he had no hope for Tuesday's talks.
Besides Mong Kok, about 1,000 protesters remained camped out at the headquarters of the civil disobedience "Occupy" movement on Hong Kong Island in a sea of tents on an eight-lane highway beneath skyscrapers close to government headquarters.

Top SME news of the weekTop SME news of the week
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | October 09, 2014 16:46 IST
The bank, which largely assists large corporations is moving to open branches dedicated solely to SME needs.
State Bank Of India (SBI) to lend support to SMEs
 
India's top most bank and lender, State Bank of India (SBI) is shifting its focus on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) now. The bank, which largely assists large corporations is moving to open branches dedicated solely to SME needs. SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya said that the bank's earlier model failed to perform due to lack of ownership. Hence, they have decided to open branches that will be completely dedicated to SMEs. Off late, banks have recorded higher defaults from larger corporates as against the SMEs. This meant that the SMEs clearly have potential that needs to be unlocked. The planned branches will not only appraise SMEs but will also monitor post sanction of loans.

Get flawless and glowing skin in 30 daysExpert Advice to Get Flawless and Glowing Skin in 30 Days
Bollywoodshaadis.com –  Tue 14 Oct, 2014 5:23 PM IST
By  Dr. Kiran Lohia
It is easy to get overwhelmed with all of the well-meaning advice from friends and relatives about what beauty regimen to follow. As a dermatologist, I get many brides looking for a skin care regime and treatments that solves all their skin woes.
So, read on to get your dermatologist’s guide to ace that glow in 30 days!
#1. Revamp Your Skin Routine
The way you treat your skin will mean the difference between glow and dullness.
Use non-foaming washes that hydrate your skin while cleansing them, and only wash your face twice a day.
Make sure you moisturise your skin with a good cream or lotion to ensure that you get fully hydrated and supple skin. Do this at least twice a day.
Recommended Read: Expert Pre-Bridal Advice for Brides with Sensitive Skin and Skin Problems
For those who don’t drink enough water, it is important to look for rich hydrating creams, which would help to compensate for the lack of internal hydration. Such creams will allow external signs of dehydration to be reduced to a large extent.

For those of you with acne, use a gel, such as Sebamed Clear Face Gel, to moisturise instead. Such gels will help your skin to get the hydration it needs without worrying about more pimples.
Finally, the actives that are a must for every bride to include in her beauty regime are vitamin C or Azelaic Acid. Vitamin C is a natural anti-dullness active, which helps prevent any oxidative damage from the external elements. Azelaic acid also helps get rid of pigmentation, making your skin fresher and brighter instantly.
Vitamins are not just amazing for your skin, but for your hair too. To know more Read:  Top 6 Vitamins for Brides to Get Long and Black Hair Naturally
#2. Natural Beauty Secrets
For natural home remedies for your skin issues, there are a multitude of options you can try out.
For dull and pigmented skin:
For those with dull or pigmented skin, can use buttermilk and mango skin mask. Buttermilk has lactic acid, a natural ingredient that is present in chemical peels that gently exfoliates the skin. Mango has vitamins, such as vitamin A, which help induce natural exfoliation as well.
This mask helps get rid of dull and dead skin cells, revealing new skin within a week. Do this weekly for best results.

For dry skin:
For those with dry skin, here is your solution. Avocado and sesame oil mixed together can immediately hydrate your skin due to its natural essential fatty acids, minerals and oils.
Apply it for 30 minutes, and then wash off for instant results.

For acne:
If you have acne, then this will work for you. Mix besan, neem powder and tea tree oil together. Apply it on the face and let it dry. Gently remove after 20 minutes for a quick anti-acne boost.
Do this twice a week to get a clearer complexion.

For skin boost:
If your skin needs an instant beauty and energy boost, then try this remedy. Mix besan, sandalwood powder, ground orange peel, lemon and yogurt. Apply it all over the body and let it dry.
Then gently remove in circular motions, allowing all your dead cells to gently slough off. This will make your body skin smooth, soft and gorgeous instantly.

#3. Wear Your Sunscreen
Sunblock is a necessity to ensure your skin stays fresh and dewy. As the sun is the primary cause of dullness and tanning, it is very important to ensure that you wear enough sunblock and reapply every 4 hours to get its full effects.
Look for sunscreens with both UVB and UVA protection, giving you at least SPF30 with PA++ at minimum.

#4. Reduce Your Stress
Stress will cause your skin to break out while also causing dullness. While it is tough with all the preparations going on, it is not impossible! Do yoga regularly and practice breathing exercises, so that you start your day on a calm note.
Remember to take time to breathe whenever you feel like you are getting overwhelmed by preparations or emotions. Finally, regular exercise will also help to get rid of tension, so join a Zumba class or try rock climbing, etc., to ensure your mind and body is occupied on enjoyable pursuits.
So, make these simple tips a part of your bridal beauty regime for at least 30 days before your wedding day, to reveal a flawlessly glowing skin.

BJP front-runner in Maharashtra  Haryana  say exit pollsComments
At least three exit polls put the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead but short of a clear majority in Maharashtra and Haryana on Wednesday, a ringing endorsement of the so-called 'Modi magic' that may have helped the party come into its own in the two politically crucial states.

A fourth survey by Today's Chanakya, which correctly predicted the results of the Lok Sabha polls this year, gave the party a clear majority in both states.
The projections, if true, could touch off a round of intense haggling between the party and its estranged allies - the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) - for control of the two states that the Congress has led for more than a decade, either on its own or with its partners.

A BJP victory will reaffirm Modi's appeal among voters and silence detractors of his new party leadership, which was blamed for a string of defeats in recent by-elections that tempered the euphoria of his Lok Sabha triumph.
Modi campaigned extensively for the state elections, addressing 27 rallies in Maharashtra and 11 in Haryana in a bid to prop up the BJP's fortunes after the by-election losses.
A Times Now-C Voter poll predicted the BJP would bag 129 of 288 seats in the politically crucial state of Maharashtra despite the falling apart of its 25-year-old association with the Shiv Sena, which was projected to win in 56 constituencies. Times Now-C Voter predicted 37 seats for the BJP in the 90-member Haryana assembly.
An ABP-Nielsen poll predicted 144 seats for the BJP and 77 for the Sena, while an India Today-Cicero exit poll saw the BJP winning 124 seats in Maharashtra. The poll says the Shiv Sena will be the second largest gainer in Maharashtra with 71 seats.
The polls did not bring any cheer to the Congress party, already relegated to the political sidelines since its bruising defeat in the Lok Sabha polls.
The Times Now-C Voter poll said the Congress was likely to win 43 seats in Maharashtra while ABP-Nielsen said it will bag just 30 seats. In Haryana, Times Now-C Voter gave the Congress 15 seats and ABP-Nielsen poll predicted the country's main opposition party will get 10 seats.
Today's Chanakya predicted a clear majority of 151 seats for the BJP in Maharashtra and 52 in Haryana. Today's Chanakya was on the money when it predicted a 300-plus sweep for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections.
For the Congress, a poor result will possibly stoke further murmurs against Rahul Gandhi's leadership.
If the outcome on Sunday's judgement day matches the predictions, it would mean the Congress would have to carry forward with its restructuring process to script a turnaround in the face of a saffron surge.
Haryana saw a high turnout of 75.9%, while Maharashtra registered a turnout of  63.4% in the elections seen as a test of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity since he stormed to power in May and the BJP's strategy to abandon long-standing allies in the states.
The elections were mainly peaceful except for minor clashes between workers of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), BJP and others in Haryana.
Analysts said the BJP had benefited from anger towards the Congress party, which has held power in Maharashtra for 15 years and Haryana for a decade. Both chief ministers, Prithviraj Chavan in Maharashtra and Bhupinder Hooda in Haryana, battled strong anti-incumbency with corruption being a major poll issue.

The BJP took a big gamble on its popularity and campaigned alone in both states.
It was in contention for power for the first time in Haryana, where it was a junior partner in the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) government in 2000. Similarly in Maharashtra, the BJP had so far played second fiddle to the Shiv Sena, which led the coalition government in the state from 1995 to 1999. The Congress-NCP alliance ruled the state for 15 years from 1999.
In case of a hung verdict, the shaping up of new political alliances promises to be another interesting chapter following the high-stakes elections.

Cong workers demand Priyanka Gandhi Vadra join active politicsCong workers demand Priyanka Gandhi Vadra join active politics

With trends projecting a defeat for Congress in both Maharashtra and Haryana, a group of party workers gathered outside the AICC office in Delhi demanding that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra join active politics.

This is not the first time that such a demand has been made but it has repeatedly been snubbed by Priyanka, who had even issued a terse statement sometime back asking people to eschew from such speculation.
Waving posters, which read 'Priyanka Lao Congress Bachao' (Bring Priyanka; Save Congress), 200 to 250 party workers, a larger number of them women, appealed to party vice-president Rahul Gandhi to take the initiative to bring his sister into politics.
"We appeal to Rahul ji to bring Priyanka Gandhi into active politics of Congress at a time when the party is passing through tough times. She can supplement him in stopping the march of Narendra Modi," a worker said outside the party office.
Some of the party workers gathered outside said that had Priyanka been brought earlier and campaigned in both states, the Assembly election results in Maharashtra and Haryana could have been different.
Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) leader Jagdish Sharma, who led the group, said the successive defeat of the party in elections make it now all the more necessary to bring Priyanka into active politics of the party to better its prospects.
"Had Priyanka Gandhi campaigned for the party in Maharasthra and Haryana, the results could have been different. In Lok Sabha polls, there was a talk of Narendra Modi wave. At that time Priyanka Gandhi was given responsibility to campaign for Raebareli and Amethi and Congress won there," Sharma, who is the National Vice President of INTUC, told PTI.
He said Congress workers are "sad" with such results for the party and feel that it's time that Priyanka is given an important responsibility in Congress for which "Rahul Gandhi, himself should take initiative."

Changes in MNREGA to not affect basic struc...Bihar
(The Union Minister, while…)
DHANBAD: Union Minister of State for Rural Development Upendra Kushwaha today said the Centre would make major changes in the MNREGA scheme, but the basic structure and mission of the project would remain same.
The Union Minister, while talking to reporters here at the Dhanbad Circuit House , expressed concern over execution of MNREGA scheme in Bihar and Jharkhand and said both states have failed to utilise the MNREGA funds properly.
Kushwaha said he was considering giving additional funds to Jharkhand and Bihar for MNREGA projects, but both state governments had not utilised the already allocated funds.
He warned of deducting additional expenditure of funds to be made as late payment compensation to MNREGA workers from the salary of state government officials.
As per rules, if MNREGA workers do not get their remuneration within 15 days of completing the work, the state government would have to compensate late payment with additional 10 per cent of the remuneration, the Minister said.
When the Minister's attention was drawn towards non-payment of MNREGA staff and officials in Jharkhand for the past nine months, Kushwaha said, "Had there been a scarcity of resources, we would have accepted the helplessness of the state government in making payments to staff and officials.
"But this is a different story. The state government has no dearth of funds. It is just not interested in utilising it."

BJP to rule Haryana  largest party in MaharashtraComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stormed to power in Haryana on Sunday and was set to form the government in Maharashtra as well, in a verdict that underlined Prime Minister Narendra Modi's indisputable role in helping expand the party's national footprint.
 
Both victories are historic for the BJP. In Haryana, where the party had never been a force, it won 47 seats in a 90-member assembly to take power on its own. In Maharashtra, it emerged as the single largest party, bagging 122 seats in the 288-member House — which is enough to form a coalition government on its own terms.

The party had taken a huge a gamble by going it alone in both states, which have either been traditional Congress strongholds or led by regional forces, but its decision to sever ties with its allies paid off.
 
Sunday's verdict sets the momentum for the party's campaign for a string of assembly polls over the next two years. It gives the BJP significant political leverage over the country's financial capital, Mumbai, and enhances its capacity for quick political mobilization in the region around the national capital, New Delhi.

Modi's intensive campaigning in both states helped the party, but its win was also partly a result of severe anti-incumbency sentiment against the Congress. Allegations of corruption and crony capitalism plagued both the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government in Chandigarh and the Congress-NCP alliance in Mumbai.
 
BJP president Amit Shah said the results were a vindication of the leadership of Modi who won a landslide victory in the April-May Lok Sabha elections.
"This is a reply to those who said after a few bypoll results that the Modi wave is over. It shows Modiji is the undisputed leader … the Modi wave is like a tsunami which has drowned everyone," he said.
As BJP supporters erupted in celebrations, the mood at the Congress camp was sombre. The grand old party suffered another humiliating defeat in the assembly elections after its worst-ever performance in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year.
"We accept the verdict of people. People have voted for a change, after 15 years of our government in Maharashtra and 10 years in Haryana," Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said in a statement.
He added the Congress will "work hard on the ground to once again earn the confidence of the people".
Highlights
 
 
The BJP's win was particularly stunning in Haryana where it leapt to a majority from just four seats in the previous assembly. The party's victory was largely a result of its decision to turn old caste equations on their head and mobilise non-Jat social groups in the state.
The saffron party won 47 seats, one more than the magic number. The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), whose chief Om Prakash Chautala is in the Tihar jail in connection with a recruitment scam, came second with 19 seats.

The Congress won 15 seats, while the Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) - BJP's estranged ally - bagged two seats.
In Maharashtra, the party's decision to campaign alone after snapping ties with its 25-year-old ally, the Shiv Sena, turned out to be a winning strategy as it established the BJP as the dominant partner. It was hoping for a majority win, but its showing was still impressive.
It had never contested more than 119 seats in the past and won more seats this time than it had ever fought earlier. Its vote share jumped from 14% to close to 28%, establishing the BJP as the clear senior partner in any future alliance.
 
The Sena, fighting alone in the polls, won 63 seats and hinted that it was ready for talks with the BJP. However, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also indicated that it will not approach the BJP on its own.  
Some reports said Uddhav congratulated Modi and BJP chief Shah after the writing on the wall was clear in signs that he too was warming up to the party.
Intense negotiations are expected over the next few days in the state, but Shah categorically said the BJP will form a government in Maharashtra. "There will be a BJP government and there will be a BJP chief minister in the state."

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, considered close to RSS leadership, has been offered the post of Maharashtra CM, party sources said.  They said Gadkari was reluctant but had been given a couple of days to decide; clarity is expected in a day or two.
Devendra Fadnavis, a fellow politician from Nagpur, is a strong contender for the job. The BJP’s parliamentary board has decided to send home minister Rajnath Singh to Mumbai as central observer to oversee the election of BJP legislature party leader.
 
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) offered outside support to a BJP-led government, triggering talks of new political equations in the wake of the verdict. Sharad Pawar's NCP could bag just 41 seats in these elections.
Its past ally, the Congress, however, was the worst affected. It won just 42 seats, down from the 82 it was able to bag in 2009.
